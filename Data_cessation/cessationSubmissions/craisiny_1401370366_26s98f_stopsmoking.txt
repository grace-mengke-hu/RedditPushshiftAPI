13 days! I feel fantastic.

I had my first cigarette when I was 14. I started smoking regularly at 18, and by the age of 21 I was smoking anywhere from 10-20 cigarettes a day. I've tried to quit probably 10 times in the past year. 13 days ago, I was home visiting my parents. As usual, I was smoking fewer cigarettes than normal and I was incredibly irritable. I went to Walgreen's and bought nicotine patches. Within an hour, I was less irritable. I never realized up until that moment how much nicotine  actually affected me and how much I was addicted to it. I always tried to convince myself that I just liked the act of smoking.

Quitting is something I wanted to do this summer, but 13 days ago I honestly didn't even think about quitting, I just did it. I even went to a party two days later and drank fairly heavily around tons of people who were smoking, and didn't even have the urge to smoke. It was amazing. 

So far, the patch is working out really well for me. I'm not a raging bitch like I usually am when I go just 5 hours without a cigarette, and I hardly even have cravings at all. I'm so proud of myself, maybe now I've finally done it! I haven't gone more than a couple days without smoking in probably at least two years. Another good thing is that my lungs are now cleaning themselves out via coughing and lots of mucus. Bad thing is that now my lungs are cleaning themselves out via coughing and lots of mucus. It's bearable and SO worth it, but feeling like I've had a cold for the past two weeks kinda sucks.

I love you guys, you're all incredible inspirations to me.

TL:DR longest I've gone, not a raging bitch, yay nicotine patch.

I'm quitting (again)

Hey, I'm not sure if my badge has reset yet, but today is day 2 (can't even remember how many day 2s I've had now...)

This time I'm using the Allen Carr method, alongside the NHS stop smoking app, and a very strict flatmate. Hopefully this will work out for me this time - it seemed such an obvious vice to give up for Lent!

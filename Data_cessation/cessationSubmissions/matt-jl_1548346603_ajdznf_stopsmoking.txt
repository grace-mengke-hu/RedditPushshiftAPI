Quitting during exams

So I'm at the point where every cigarette just makes me feel disgusting, but the only issue is I'm currently cramming for uni exams and I'm worried the cravings will distract me.


I don't want to use a nicotine replacement, does anyone have any advice on not getting distracted by cravings? Thanks in advance ðŸ’•

Okay, It's time to stop.

This is it. I'm done. I have smoked for 18 years. I took a short break when I was pregnant with my son, but started up again when he was just 2 days old. He will be 9 this Saturday and he has begged me to stop. I can do it. I've kicked harder things than ciggs. I just wanted to put this out there, to make it real. I want to see my son graduate, to dance with him at his wedding, to hold my grandchildren... to live and breath.

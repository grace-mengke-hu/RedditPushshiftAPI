Dreams of smoking

It's weird, I know i'll never smoke again, i wont "slip up" 2 weeks into my quit and I feel really good and really confidant. However I keep having dreams that I slip up and smoke again, it feels so real. It legitimately bothered me, I actually feel like i failed something when I wake up, sounds silly I know.

I am an Android developer and I want to help my fellow quitter. What kind of app would help you?

I have quit smoking almost 12 days ago now and I believe that I can do it this time! Anyways, I am an Android app developer and I would like to help you all quit smoking as well by making a helpful quitting smoking app. There are many out there, so I am looking to do it different, to try to add something new to the range of options. To make sure that it's not just "different" but that it adds some new value to your life as a quitter, I would like to ask you some questions:

Do you have an interesting method of quitting and do you have an idea of an app that could work for that?

What do you think of the current apps that are intended to help you quit smoking. Do they actually help you? If not, what are you missing? If so, what apps (and features) help you?

Here is an idea that I have (not to steer you in a certain direction, please think freely ;) ): my main challenge with quitting is doing it for *years*, and then *days*. I mean, if I get through the first days, it's easy to make that into weeks or months. But then I inevitably get stupid/stressed/drunk/frustrated (in a state where smoking seems attractive) and I relapse (and I may smoke for weeks or months after that). I have been doing that for years now. I am considering whether an app can help me prevent that.

Another idea is an app to get you through the first days and weeks, with a timer and messages that say what is happening to your health now (how things are improving). This way of thinking always helps me get through the first days to months (I usually check the list at whyquit.com. There are many like this, but perhaps I can do it in an interesting new way.

Anyways, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any input! :)

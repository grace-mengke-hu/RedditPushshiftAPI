Best way to use pharmacy brand nicotine patches?

Hi everyone :) 

I bought a pack of Rexall transdermal patch, it's a typical pharmacy brand one (round with terrible band-aid color), but it simply does not want to stick like the brand name patches.

I hate sounding cheap, especially when I'm saving money from not smoking, but the difference between each box is $30, so of course I go for the cheap ones. 

Is there any tricks to have these stick better? I've never had an issue with brand name patches, these are semi-disappointing. 

Thanks for the awesome sub by the way, I'm sure it'll help with my 2nd attempt of quitting.

Sudden Realization of Truth.

28 days or so since my last analogue cigarette. To treat myself, I decided to invest the money I saved (along with a large sum from my standard savings) in a motorbike. 

The first thing I did once I booked my test was to (I know, I know), research the crash/death rate for motorbikes. Turns out the chances of a fatal accident occurring is 0.001%, yet...this still scared the shit out of me. What if I was that 0.001%?!

Then, something came to mind. 

What was the chances of dying from smoking? If you're over 30, it's a damn sight more than 0.001%, it's in the range of 30-33% of dying before your 80th birthday from smoking related diseases. 

So how, I wondered, did the tiniest percentage that I could crash my motorbike scare me MORE than a 30% chance of dying from an easily preventable cause?

Fuck you brain. Convincing myself that smoking wouldn't kill me due to the amount of time between activity and reaction was the reason I never stopped until last month. 

I'm glad that's behind me now, remember, don't let your brain fool you into justifying smoking, there's a pretty high chance you'll die from it.

There are hundreds of cool ways to die, COPD/lung cancer ain't one of them. 

If you don't hear back from me, then I'm probably in the 0.001%, but skidding off a cliff into a deep ravine sounds WAY cooler than lying in a hospital bed for years, full of tubes and struggling for breath.

Stay safe out there, hope this wasn't too wordy and insane.

Peace.

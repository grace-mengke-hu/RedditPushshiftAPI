Difficulty quitting because of the damn car.

Throwaway because my girlfriend doesn't know that I smoke, and she knows my reddit account.

I have been trying to quit for a few months now and I can usually only go about two days before I'm right back at it. I feel super guilty because my girlfriend doesn't know that I smoke. She knew I smoked initially, and she didn't like it, so I quit about three years into our relationship. But I picked back up about two weeks later and never told her. I clean my car when I have to drive. When I drive to meet up I smoke a cigarette and use hand sanitizer and gum to get rid of the scent. I feel like a scumbag, and she's the major reason I want to quit.

The main reason I'm making this post is because I spend a lot of time in my car, and I've heavily come to associate driving with smoking. I feel totally fine hanging out at home, hanging out with my girlfriend, drinking, basically anything that doesn't involve my car. However, I drive about an hour to work, an hour to church, and about 45 minutes to school (why does everything I do have to be so far?), and the second that car turns on I have an immediate urge to smoke. On break at work? Go to the car and smoke. I have an hour long break at school? Go to my car and smoke a few cigarettes before class.

I think it comes from when I lived at home, I'd always have to leave to have a smoke, so I'd drive my car to a parking lot down the street to smoke. I've always had crappy excuses to tell my parents why I was leaving, so I'd feel like I had to stay out of the house for at least an hour. So I'd be sitting in my car, smoking away, looking at my phone. Sometimes I'd even bring a book.

I need help disassociating my car from smoking. I looked online but nothing really worked for me. So I come to you guys, wondering if any of you have gone through the same thing, and how you overcame it? Or just any general advice would be helpful.

Follow up to "I fell off wagon" - still going strong!

**TL;DR** I quit for 2 years 2.5 years go.  Smoked again, quit again.

It's been some time and I'm happy to say this second 'quitting' was much easier and with much less bite than the first time.

I'm not rationalizing quitting as easy, and it won't increase my likelihood of smoking just because it's easy to quit again.

I love the feeling of not-smoking.  It's so healthy, energetic, and full.

Thanks babies!

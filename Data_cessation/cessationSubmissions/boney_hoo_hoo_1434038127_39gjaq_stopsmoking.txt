10 Weeks no smoking, no cheating, no compromises.

My uncle died in February from a quintuple cancer grand slam. He was 62 and smoked since he joined the Air Force. The diagnosis came after inflammation in his spine paralyzed his lower half. Then they found the lung, bone (spine/hips/ribs), stomach, and colon cancers. It was barely a week after that, thankfully, because my uncle was in a lot of pain. His family was not ready to lose their dad. 
I've tried to quit 4 times in the last 8 years. Every single time I forced myself to do it, having to subconsciously drag my self through the process only to end up bumming smokes from friends until giving up entirely. 
This time I finished my last pack, and haven't looked back. It's been 10 full weeks, and I am over halfway through the 11th. No cheating, not even a drag of someone else's smoke. I didn't used to have that resolve. I didn't used to want to quit at all. Things have been different this time around. I think my uncle is looking out for me this time. I can do this.

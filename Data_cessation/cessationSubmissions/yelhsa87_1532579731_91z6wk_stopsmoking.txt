I stopped drinking 106 days ago, I am now cigarette free as well. The Smoker’s Flu is hell!

I quit cigarettes last Monday, and started using nicotine gum. Then this Sunday I stopped using the gum. The last few days have been pure hell and I have full blown smokers flu symptoms. I am thankful to be experiencing this as it’s makng any cravings a mood point, I never ever wanna have withdrawals again, F smoking drinking or anything else addictive! I am so happy to be where I am today after smoking for 16 years.
I am 31, and yes quitting my once a week drinking first has really helped I think, I know if I had a beer I would say forget it- give me a smoke too. Anyhow, those just beginning this journey my only advice is this: JUST DO IT, keep quitting, quit every minute of the day until you’re barely thinking of cravings. It gets better.

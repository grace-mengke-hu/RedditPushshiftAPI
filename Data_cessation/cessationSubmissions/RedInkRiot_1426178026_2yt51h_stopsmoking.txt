48 hours down, but I have a sore throat now. Anyone else have this as a physical withdrawal symptom?

I've been a smoker for 8 years and quit for a month or more a handful of times but I always end up going back. Anyway, I've made it 48 hours into this attempt and am holding strong, but I woke up with a sore throat and my glands look swollen. I can't remember if this happened in the past when I quit.

Anyone else get a sore throat as a withdrawal symptom? How long did it last? Anything else I should be on the lookout for when it comes to physical withdrawal?

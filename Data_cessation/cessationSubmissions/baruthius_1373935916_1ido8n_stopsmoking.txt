Last Friday was 100 days completely clean, and I couldn't have done it without you all

This is just a thank you. Although I don't post much here, I frequently visit this subreddit and read all of your supportive comments and posts. Since I quit, I've been able to start running again, I have more energy, I am eating healthier, and I just feel more confident in general. I went from smoking a pack of Marlboro Reds a day and decided to quit cold turkey. It was shitty at first, but it's gotten really easy and I barely ever think about it. So, /r/stopsmoking, thank you. I love you all, and I have faith in each and every one of you. Stay strong. That is all.

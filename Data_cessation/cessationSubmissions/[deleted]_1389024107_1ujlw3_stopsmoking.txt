RRRAAAAARRRR Why can't I quit

I'm fucking furious with myself already.  I think about quitting constantly, I tell myself almost daily that I'm going to quit today but when I try I feel like I don't have a hope in hell.  I've tried it all, read the book, tried the quitting drugs, patches, gum.  I've smoked for 20 yrs and have quit a couple of times for a week a month..but lately I can't go an hour, wtf.

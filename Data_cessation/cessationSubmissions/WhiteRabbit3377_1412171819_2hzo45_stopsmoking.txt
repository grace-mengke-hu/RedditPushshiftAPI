Day 2

Hey All, 

 Long time lurker & I finally pulled the trigger. Today is Day 2. 

I had previously been trying to cut back from a pack a day, previously used Chantix (which made me a RAGE monster) yearssssss ago & nothing has stuck.

I was talking to a coworker Monday afternoon who bummed a smoke from me and is trying to quit, only to find out he has been diagnosed with tongue cancer. FUCKING TONGUE CANCER.

He has only smoked for 3 years, is under 40 and was telling me his wife has no intentions of quitting. 

This just really hit me hard because I have read part of Allen's book and I'm tired of being a fucking slave. I haven't enjoyed smoking for quite some time... so I'm freeing myself.

I smoked the last cig I had Monday afternoon around 5:45pm (you do eventually stop counting hours, right?) and decided why use a nic replacement when I had gone 12+ hours between my last cig & sleeping..... 

Yesterday was surprisingly easy. I have found it mentally much harder than physically (again, surprising because I was a pack a day smoker)....and I slept like shit last night. 

I just wanted to say THANK YOU to all of your for posting your stories, your struggles and your triumphs. It's good to know that none of us are in this alone.

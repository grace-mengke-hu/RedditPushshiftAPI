Alright guys, day one! Some support and a question answer needed.

I recently tried to quit a few weeks ago, but didn’t even last a day. I work an incredibly stressful job and it’s often the main trigger for me to go buy more pods. I should add, that I’ve been off cigarettes for a couple years but my addiction to the Juul is easily 10x worse. As soon as I wake up I use it, in the bathroom at work, when driving, there’s pretty much not a time that I don’t use it besides sleep. The hardest part of quitting is I actually miss it. It’s become so much a part of me that I genuinely get afraid of what’s ahead without it. My question is I bought Nic gum because of how much I can smoke with the juul. Sometimes I’ll go through a pod and a half a day. Has anyone had success with gum or should I stay away from it? Thank you guys for being a community of support to lean on during this time. I’m sure I’ll keep updating throughout my journey. 


Tl;dr has anyone had success with nicotine gum? Or should I stay away from it.

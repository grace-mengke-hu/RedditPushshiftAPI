I caved after 60 days and feeling so demoralized and need help

I had quit before the New Years and had managed to resist easily first 50 days because I was so convinced I was officially free of the demon, but as I posted before, I was struggling to resist during a particularly hard time...and [there was this user who made me feel so motivated](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ausz7s/1_month_and_28_days_smoke_free_and_it_was_all/ehcb4s1) to continue by saying I should always remain ahead of their quit date...but I still gave in. I thought 1 cigarette would be fine and I fell into the trap of "oh I went this long without it, it'll be easy to quit" but they're not kidding when they say one puff is never really one puff.

Now it's been 3 days and I keep finding an excuse to smoke, and I feel like the New Years had made me feel like a "fresh start" and now I don't know how to maintain a new beginning...ughhhh! :( I miss feeling so proud of my clear lungs and sense of will power

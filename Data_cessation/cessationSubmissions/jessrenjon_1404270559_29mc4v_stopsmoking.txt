I know I should quit but..

I'm tired of smoking. I'm tired of buying cigarettes, needing them, smelling like them, depending on them. Nothing feels worse than waking up and realizing that you have to go to the store asap. 

I have all these reasons to quit, yet I still feel an attachment to smoking and quitting makes me a little sad. I've met a lot of friends by smoking (going to the smoking area every day) and I feel like there's a community of smokers that I don't want to lose. I was in the mental hospital a few months ago and I bonded with some really great people out on the smoke porch. I smoke when I'm stressed, happy, sad, whatever. I just feel kind of sad about losing the cigarettes. 

Does anyone else feel this way? How can I get over it?

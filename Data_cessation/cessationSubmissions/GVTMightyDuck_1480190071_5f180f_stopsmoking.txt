New here, need some advice about quitting especially relating to anxiety.

Hello. I'm 26, been a smoker for 7 years. I am getting to the point where I actually WANT to quit, which I know is necessary to make it happen. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in my early teens and been on anti anxiety medication for 11 years. It's helped some but not completely. I've read things that say nicotine withdrawal can make anxiety worse. I'm afraid I'll become a basket case when I quit and just be in a constant state of anxiety. Has anyone else dealt with this and can give me advice?

tl:dr - I'm worried quitting will make my anxiety disorder worse.

I'm about to go Walter White on these flies. Day 1

Haven't given in yet, I really want to. On top of that the house I'm sitting for has no screen so when I let the dog out flies come in. They are buzzing around the laptop- 'cuz light. I'll be fine, I just need to rant because apparantly when you're quitting nothing is more infuriating then the buzzz of those flying bastards.

Where i'm going i don't need cigarettes

I started smoking when i was a teen. I remember my first cigarette, it was a Gauloises Red that i stole from a friend. That was 19 years ago. Since then i must have smoked about 50,000 cigarettes of which i honestly don't remember enjoying any of them.

I tried quitting at least 10 times, lasting as much as 6 months before making the mistake of smoking "just one", which inevitably became an addiction again.

My mother suffered from cancer and if i was to get sick i know it would destroy her. This is part of the reason why i want to quit, but it's not the only one. I want to be free from the slavery, free from the brain parasite that has been leaching my confidence, freedom, health and energy. 

I smoked my last cigarette a few minutes ago, stomping it hard on the ground. I know that i may get cravings in the next few days, but i know that they are caused by the last cigarette i smoked and that they will disappear in a few days. 

My desire to smoke has already disappeared, i don't need cigarettes, they serve no purpose in my future.

Where i'm going i don't need cigarettes.

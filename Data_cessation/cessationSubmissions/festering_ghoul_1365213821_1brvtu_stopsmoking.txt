It starts today. Both weed and smokes!

i'm 19 and i've only been smoking cigs for a year and a half. I started on cpt blacks. and I've been a chronic weed smoker for 2 and a half years. cigs are too damn expensive and just not worth the 5 seconds of happiness, and weed is just a motivation killer. it makes you feel fine at doing nothing at all, i think a lot of people can agree with me on that one. anyways ever since i started my life has kinda gone down a spiral and i think smoking in general has a huge part of this, mentally especially. what do YOU think? i need some motivation here. weed is my big crutch.

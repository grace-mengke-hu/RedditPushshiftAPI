My 22 year old daughter has just started smoking. Any tips on how I can get her to stop?

TBH it came out of no where, me and mum have never smoked and why start at 22 when she should know better by now.  Is there anything we can say or do to get her to stop now before full blown addiction sets in.  I have tried talking sense but she won't listen.

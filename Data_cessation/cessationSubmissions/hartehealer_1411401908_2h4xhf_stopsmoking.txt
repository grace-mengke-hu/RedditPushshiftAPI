The date's been set

I'm incredibly new to reddit as a user but this community was revealed to me through the missions on Smoke Free app. I recently slipped up after doing a quit challenge with my father who chews tobacco (and has been longer than I've been alive). I've been a smoker for 5 years with at least four previous attempts to quit. The quit challenge being the most recent. I lasted 5 weeks that time. The attempt before that was 7 months but I was isolated throughout the 7 months and incredibly ill so it was easy to stay away from the temptation. As soon as I got well and got a job, I was around smokers and I didn't know how to adjust so I just caved.

Now I've set a quit date of this upcoming Sunday, the 28th. And I'm doing so with a better motivation than previously. Despite my past health issues, it never seemed to stick that I would make myself sicker down the line if I continued smoking. I could brush that off. But as my plan is to have children later on and be a midwife, I care more about my fertility and future health of my children than my own health.

I'm hoping to be a member of this community and give as well as get motivation and inspiration and advice as I quit. This time, for good.

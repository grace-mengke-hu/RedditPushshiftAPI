Need to quit smoking spliffs

I'm just here looking for advice and/or motivation. I've smoked on and off almost my whole life (had my first cigarette at age 12, thanks sis /s) and for the past year or so it's been spliffs - rolled cigarette with weed added.    
I've tried numerous times to quit cold turkey, but the symptoms are overwhelming to me - terrible anxiety, horrific nightmares, etc. I was thinking maybe continuing with spliffs but slowly increasing the pot to tobacco ratio until I'm eventually just smoking joints, but that would be outrageously expensive...    
I'm wondering if anyone has similar experience, or any advice or anything of the nature regarding... I have Carr's "The Easy Way" on hold at the library so I'll give that a read when it becomes available but until then...

3 days in

been hooked on one of those damn vape sticks for like 4 years, woke up the other day and just decided i was gonna quit when faced with the ultimatum of buying more juice or not vaping. Feel good, somewhat more irritable but it doesnt fucking matter. If i made a decision to start the shit theres no reason i cant make the decision to stop. We intelligent humans are stronger than some dumb fucking chemical.

Stopped at the convenience store.

and got coffee and super dark chocolate. Wanted to buy a pack of smokes but pulled myself out of line, went into an aisle and did some meditative breathing and got myself through the craving so that I could buy my items and leave without buying cigarettes. I must have looked like a nut, but I don't care! I made it home without caving!

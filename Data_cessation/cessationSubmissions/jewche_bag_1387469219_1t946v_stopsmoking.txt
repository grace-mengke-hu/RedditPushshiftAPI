It's been a long road, but in 5 days it will be 2 years.

I wanted to come on here and just say thanks to all of you. I've only made a few posts and comments, but I do frequent this subreddit a lot. It's good to see people are putting down the habit, and even better to see such a supporting community. I'd also like to say, to those of you who are either just starting or even slipped up, don't worry, it'll get easier with time.

So, thanks again, and here's to a new year!

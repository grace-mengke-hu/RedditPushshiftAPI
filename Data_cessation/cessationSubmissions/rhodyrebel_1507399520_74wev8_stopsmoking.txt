30 year old, been smoking 14 years. Quitting. Anxiety ensues, advice appreciated.

Hey all.  Like the title says, I've been smoking for the last 14 years, pack a day for the last I don't know 10 years. Just tossed out my last two cigarettes, and I'm planning on quitting. Simply the thought of not smoking anymore or not having cigarettes on me gives me slight anxiety, regardless of my desire to quit. So any advice is appreciated. I'll post an update in a couple of days to let you know how many heads I've ripped off in the meantime.

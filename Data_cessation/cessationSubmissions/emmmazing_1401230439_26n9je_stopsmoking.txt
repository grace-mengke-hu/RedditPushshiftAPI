2 months!!!!!!!!!111! thanks for the support!

just checking in-- i hit 2 months cigarette free this weekend!! i never thought it would happen (without a bun in the oven, anyway) but it has! i feel freaking amazing. my cravings are basically gone, i can breathe and smell and taste regularly again, and i don't stink any more (and ew, gross, i can't believe i actually smelled like that for 10 years and was okay with it. bleh.) i will admit that i still love the smell of OTHERS smoking, and will as close as i can to it when possible, but i'm never having another cigarette. ever.\\

**tl;dr**: 2 months smoke free, i'm feeling great, and i never want another.

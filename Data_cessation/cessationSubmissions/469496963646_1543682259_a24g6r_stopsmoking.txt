Smoke Free, want to smoke so bad.

Smoke free since 04.20.2018.
Last month was particularly shitty...
Every year around this time I get horrible (yet short) depression. I had a nervous breakdown the day before yesterday. I bought a pack today, probably going to light up.

Last time I just quit, didn't really have "that last smoke". I am very stoic usually so I have decided this will be my last pack, whether I light up or not.
Will it kill me?

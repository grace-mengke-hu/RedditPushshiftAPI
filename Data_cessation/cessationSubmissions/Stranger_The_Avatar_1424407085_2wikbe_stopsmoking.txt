Lack of motivation

Hello everyone. I'm sorry if this is asked before or not.
I've been smoking for 5 years now.
I'm little overweight, I must do sports and stuff to lose weight but I can't do sports successfuly because smoking affects my lungs and health, you know.
So I'm trying to stop smoking but whenever I try, I become unsuccessful.
I say myself *"okay, I can solve this by myself"* but at some point, I be like *"whatever, let me smoke one more"* or something like that(especially after meal). It's really annoying. Can you guys help me? I really don't know if it is the right place to ask this, thanks.

I had the thought this weekend. You know the one. Wife is gone. Cash in pocket, no traceable way to have anyone know the purchase. Just have one, maybe a few? No one would know. I could get away with it and quit later! Nope. Staying strong. Stupid thoughts. Presenting #048 Venonat. See you tomorrow.

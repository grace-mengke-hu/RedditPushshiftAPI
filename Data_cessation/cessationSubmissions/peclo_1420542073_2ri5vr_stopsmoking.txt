Hell yes!

This is getting easier and easier! I don't have to think about it anymore, and boy, I sure thought that my life was ruined because I couldn't enjoy a cigarette anymore. I was wrong!

I love to be around smokers just to experience the non-desire to smoke, and to feel the pride of being smoke free for more than two years!


For reference, I used to smoke 20 cigs a day, and I couln't imagine myself without smoking.

Keep it up you guys! Totally worth it!

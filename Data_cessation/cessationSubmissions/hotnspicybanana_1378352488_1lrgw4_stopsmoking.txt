Why I want to quit

I'm tired of smelling like smoke, I'm tired of being one of the very few that smokes here in my dorm. I feel like the outcast. I'm tired of not buying things I want to make sure I have enough money to buy cigarettes. And most importantly I'm tired of not being able to breathe after walking up a flight of stairs or a steep hill. So today I woke up and decided that this was gonna be the day. I left my cigarettes in my dorm room for the day and did fairly well. I did smoke a couple cigarettes but honestly they didn't taste good like they normally are, and I couldn't even finish them. I think I did it out of boredom. But I'm feeling very good about myself. I usually smoke a pack a day, and only smoking two cigs is giving me hope.

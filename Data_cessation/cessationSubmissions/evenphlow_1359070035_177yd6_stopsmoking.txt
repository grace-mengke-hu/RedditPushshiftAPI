Quit 17 days ago, have had sore throat since.

Can anybody verify that this is a result of quitting? I have been waking up every morning swallowing daggers and coughing up very hard phlegm (gross I know sorry) but then the pain subsides as I get up and go about my day. I'm pretty sure that I don't have flu or strep as I have no other symptoms but this sore throat is unbearable and doesn't seem to be getting any better as the days pass. My taste/smell has also been non-existent like if I had a cold since I quit.

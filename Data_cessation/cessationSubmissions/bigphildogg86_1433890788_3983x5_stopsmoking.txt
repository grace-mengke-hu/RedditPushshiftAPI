Slipping

I am slipping. About two years ago I had quit completely for about a year. Then I started again after a night of drinking. Then I smoked for about 6 months. Then about two months ago I quit again cold turkey. First time was with Chantix. I quit for a month straight then I had a slip but kept going. 
Now I have smoked three nights in a row. I keep buying a pack, smoking about 8 through the evening then throwing the rest of the pack away. Somehow I've let myself do it three time. Bought more on my way home again. Currently smoking. I NEED to stop. I feel so much better when I quit. I am training fmto run 5ks and just gotta stop. I need an intervention! !

1 month later and I still have phlegm?

It's not all through-out the day, usually just mornings I have a decent amount I have to spit out from the back of my throat or my voice will sound scratchy all day.

 I know it sounds quite odd to say but I embrace it fully, It feels amazing to know my body is cleaning itself of all the nastiness I have been poisoning myself with all these years.  


Is this normal? and how long should it last for, if it helps anyway, I've been smoking for more than two complete orbits around the sun.

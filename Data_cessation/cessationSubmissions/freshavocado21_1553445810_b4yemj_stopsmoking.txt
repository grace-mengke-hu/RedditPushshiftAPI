This week marks 5 months cig free for me

I saw another post thanking this sub for someone’s 6 month mark and wanted to do the same- a lot of times when I was at home wanting a smoke I would scroll through this sub and it helped me a lot so... thank you n_n just today I was carrying some of my boss’ stuff for her around work and she smokes, and I was remembering how my jacket used to smell the same way as hers and it was like I didn’t even notice at the time. A lot of aspects of my life have changed for the better since quitting and I wish that for all of you too 🙏

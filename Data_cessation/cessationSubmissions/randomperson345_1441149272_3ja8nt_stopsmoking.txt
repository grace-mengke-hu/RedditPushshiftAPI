I quit today

So, my 9 yr old daughter loves minecraft and hates cigarettes  (her dad and I both smoke).  Well, she's taken the time to make me a house, with plaques along the walls, with all the dangers of smoking. 

That's it, I have to quit now. I'm charging up an old ecig now, to help with cravings for a few days. Any and all advice is welcome and encouraged. I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing it for her. I'm ashamed enough that I started back up when she was 2. Ugh.

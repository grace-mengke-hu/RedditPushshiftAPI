On 365 days...

I can't believe that yesterday marked a year since I quit smoking.

Wow.  How amazing it feels! I don't have to worry about how I smell (which was a HUGE thing for me) or how many smokes I have before I go on a long trip, or go to bed, or go to work or ...whatever.  I am not *chained* to the sick sticks.

I am grateful. And, as self-righteous as it may sound, I only have myself to thank for this accomplishment.  I'm unfathomably proud of myself... I'm surrounded by smokers and less than enthusiastic people, but I made it through. I dug my heels in for every craving, for every glorious one.. and got through them. 

Thanks for having this subreddit, y'all. One of the most rewarding parts of this journey has been my counter. Reading posts here has also been a motivating factor.  :)

It's all downhill from here, if you ask me.  And I believe, that all of you, wanting to quit -- *dying* to quit -- can do it. I know you can.  Surround yourself with supportive people.  Do it even though others don't really care or understand. Do it because YOU want to. Do it for your health, your hair, skin and nails, your stamina, your sex life, your children and your children's children.  Do it for YOU. :)

If I can quit on my own, I believe you can, too.

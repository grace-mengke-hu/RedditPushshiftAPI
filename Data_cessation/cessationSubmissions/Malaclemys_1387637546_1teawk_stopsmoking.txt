Umm... Is this it?

I was a very active smoker for four years until Tuesday.

It has been what... Four days? No, five! It has been five days since I decided to stop. I didn't prepare much or anything. I thought it was going to be a few hellish weeks, but I had the will to handle that.

The first two days were as expected.  
Tuesday night was nervous, edgy, but bearable. I kind of wanted to smoke, but not all that much and jogging kept my mind off of it, while some red wine helped me fall asleep.  
Wednesday, I felt sick. The cheap red wine from the day before combined with only three to four hours of sleep didn't really help me out either. I still *did things* to keep my mind occupied and even though I wasn't feeling alright, I did manage to do my job, go jogging and even go to a party with smokers. I didn't smoke.

Thursday was weird though. I was missing my morning cigarette, but drinking lots of coffee really helped. I was grumpy, but that could easily be attributed to drinking four strong cups of coffee. I was hungrier than usual, but not too much.  
What I didn't feel was sick, tired, nervous. The cravings were gone.

Since then, it's as if I've never even started smoking.  
I mean, I do get the occasional idea to roll and light one from time to time, but it's just the old habit calling. I shoot those thoughts down quickly. As intrusive as they are, they're easy to dismiss and far in-between. There's *literally* no other psychological remnant of addiction.  
The only thing I miss is having a "frame" of sorts. Smoking was my way of framing things. I would always light a cigarette before and after eating, coding, writing, sex (not always before), playing music, even hitchhiking. Now I have to get used to living without this, or find another such thing to do.

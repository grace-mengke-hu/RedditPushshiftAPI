I realized how good my friends are last night.

So, last night was my birthday party. I had people over and some of my friends went outside to light up. I walked outside and one of my friends said, "HEY! where do you think you're going?" I said, "to get a drink?" She responded, " oh, okay. Just making sure you weren't going to smoke...." I'm so glad I have friends who are willing and able to be supportive of me quitting.

Despite being completely wasted, (smoking was always a go-to drinking activity) I didn't have a single puff.

Just thought I'd share :)

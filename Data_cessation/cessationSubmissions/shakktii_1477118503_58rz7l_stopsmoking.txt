Ok here I go

I'm tired of smoking I want to quit, but it's hard (I know it's an addiction). I want this to be the time. Found this Reddit so hoping a support system of others having gone through will help more. Don't like medicine and can't trust myself with nic replacement feel it makes it harder. So just put out the last one. Any advice or anything will be helpful. 1 minute down the rest of my life to go.

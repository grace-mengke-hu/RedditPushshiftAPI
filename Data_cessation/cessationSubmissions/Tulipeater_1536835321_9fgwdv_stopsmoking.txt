Any advice for someone who smokes out of boredom instead of stress related reasons?

I’ve been unemployed and without a mode of transportation for a year and a half now, for reasons. 
I’m not really happy about it, I like to be busy. 

Anyway, I’ve tried to quit cold turkey but come the third day I always realize how boring my life truly is and go out for a smoke break to break up the monotony that is my life. 

What I would like to know, is what do you guys do to keep yourself busy in the time that you would usually use for a smoke break? 

I crochet as a hobby, which I have seen suggested here a few times as a way to help quit... but my problem with that was that my cig breaks is what I used to break up the hours of crochet work.

Idunno. I kinda feel hopeless to my addiction and it makes me feel worthless heh. 

Any kind of help/suggestions would be appreciated; I gotta get my gears turning on how I’m gunna make quitting cigs work for me. Smoking them isn’t an option anymore!

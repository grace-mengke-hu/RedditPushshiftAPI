Quit 5 days ago, can't study for my finals.

Yeah, quitting just before finals was a bad idea. Not a long time smoker, 20 years old and its been 7-8 months. smoking a pack  a day for the last 3-4 months. cravings are real. on top of that, after my last final, sunday night i will go to germany and party for a week. I'm pretty scared smoking again while drunk, since thats how i started. Oh man, fuck cigarettes. should i smoke few to relieve my stress? I know i shouldnt, FUUUUCk

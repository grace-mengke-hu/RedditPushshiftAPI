When can I drink again?

I'm trying to quit smoking but I also happen to be an alcoholic who needs about a litre of hard liquor a week to feel normal. My work schedule give me two different off sections in the week so I binge on the night before my break.

I decided to stop smoking primarily because when I started Tapout XT I realized my breathing was holding me back.

I don't know if I'll ever be ready to give up alcohol though. I start remembering bad shit when I don't drink.

Any advice on how to drink without smoking?

Vaping Nicotine after 3 years smoke/Nicotine free.

I've been smoke and nicotine free for the past 3 years. I caved and bought a vape. I really missed the sensation and the activity, and I thought why not. I vaped 0mg e-juices for awhile, but then made the decision to buy a 6mg nicotine e-juice. 

I don't know, I just feel really disappointed with myself. I wanted to feel the buzz again.

Best Christmas gift ever: my dad told me he finally quit smoking after over 30 years!! Happy holidays and best wishes to you all.

I've been trying to get my dad to quit for over 10 years, and I guess the last time I talked to him about it this past summer, it finally stuck. My parents waited until Christmas to tell me, and I almost cried. Apparently he quit about 2 months ago cold turkey. I actually bought him a book in August, and apparently he hates reading so much that he decided he'd rather quit than read the book!

I'm so so SO happy and proud of my father's decision to live a healthier lifestyle. If you have loved ones who have been nagging you about quitting, take it from me that they'll really be trememdously happy to hear about your decision. I wish the absolute best to all of you on your journey to be smoke free, and hope you all have a wonderful holiday season. May your new year be filled with friends, love, personal progress, and good health! 

tl;dr: Dad finally quit smoking. I'm beyond happy! This is a great community and I wish you all the best! :)

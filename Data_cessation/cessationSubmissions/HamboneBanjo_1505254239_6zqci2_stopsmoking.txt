I just picked up a halfer out of my yard and threw it away without a second thought.

It was my nephew's. He still smokes, but not in front of us as a courtesy.  I never have liked butts in my yard but he probably left it on the porch accidentally and it blew into the yard bc we no longer have ashtrays. Regardless, I picked it up and saw it had about 75% to go still. It looked fresh too, probably from this morning. I paid no mind beyond the first things I noticed. I felt no temptation (this was very surprising). I just walked it over to the trash can and tossed it in amongst the other refuse. This was an unexpected opportunity for success. I'm pleased with the outcome.

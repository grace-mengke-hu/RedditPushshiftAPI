Today is REALLY difficult.

So I'm coming up on 48 hours now, and it's been really, really hard. 

I couldn't get to sleep until 6:00AM last night, and then I had a very vivid, sad dream that triggered some sort of anxiety/depressive attack. I don't know how to describe it: I felt very scared, alone, with an overwhelming sense of dread. I woke up covered in sweat. Not really because of smoking -- I wasn't thinking about smoking, I was thinking about other issues in my life -- but it definitely made me *want* to smoke.

It's dissipated throughout the day, but I still feel pretty down/anxious. I believe this is because I have an anxiety disorder, but would use cigarettes to manage those feelings. I know smoking doesn't reduce anxiety, but before, if I had a nightmare, I would immediately have a cigarette and feel better.

There is also this empty sensation in my chest, like the feeling of inhaling smoke is missing.

FWIW, I am on the patch.

Don't know if anyone can relate, but I decided to post instead of run out and buy cigarettes (which is what I want to do).

how to not gain weight?

hey everyone! I'm glad i found this subreddit as it's extremely inspiring. Well, my time has come and I need to give it the ol' boy scout try and finally begin my new life as an ex-smoker. I'm sure you guys who didn't gain weight get asked this all the time but how did you quit smoking without packing on the weight? I don't mind putting on a few pounds but I don't want to exceed 5 lbs. I currently exercise almost daily and eat pretty good, should I just increase the amount? I should mention that I'm going to be aided by the nicoret patch and I currently smoke about a pack a day.

thanks for the advice!

Do I say something?

My father supposedly stopped smoking 2 years ago after he had a heart attack but a couple of months ago I caught him in the act... I was really proud of him but seeing him smoke just broke my heart. I didn’t say anything and he kind of played it off. A few weeks later I witnessed him smoking again, still hadn’t said anything... He isn’t in the best shape and I want the best for him but when I’ve tried to approach him about this topic he would be in denial and said it was the neighbor. I don’t feel like I’m able to confront my mom with the situation because she said she would divorce my father if she ever caught him smoking again—although this may just be a threat to prevent him from smoking I believe she will carry out with this idea if it were to happen. What do I do? I know I should speak up, but what do I say, what do I do?

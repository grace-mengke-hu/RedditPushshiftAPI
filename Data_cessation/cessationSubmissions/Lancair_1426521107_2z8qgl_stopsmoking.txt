Been a while

Decided to come to the sub to see how long it had been. 310 days which is awesome.  I didn't quit cold turkey.  None of the books or anything helped.  I ended up trying vaping and it worked.  Now,  I'm down to 6mg, I think.  However,  I don't even vape  a lot.  My new employer doesn't allow smoking on the property for employees.  I'm not about to go all the way off site just for that.  And, at home,  I'm busy with my 4 month old so...now it becomes a once a day for about two minutes thing.  I'm content for now but see myself getting 0mg soon.

I have some questions.

1. What the hell do you do when you want to get away from people for 5 minutes? I usually just say 'I'm going outside for a smoke'.

2. Is it normal to feel as though there are strings of phlegm running down the back of my throat?  It feels like I am going to choke.

3. I am irrationally angry.  I want to scream 'you don't deserve to be happy' at people. Is this normal and when will it go away?

4. I am irrationally sad.  I am crying over all sorts of things.  I mostly end up crying because I am so angry.  Is this normal and when will it go away?

5. I can smell my neighbours food.  I do not like the smell of my neighbours food.  I have a very short fuse at the moment.  Not a question.  Just a statement.

6. My heart rate has increased by about 30BPM.  I was at the gym yesterday and was at 160BPM where I am normally 125-130BPM for the exact same exercise.  Is increased heart rate normal?

7. I am disgusted that I have let a substance rule my life.  I was texting people in the middle of the night asking them for cigarettes because I figured that if I didn't buy them then it didn't count.  I am an addict and this is disgusting.  I dug a bumper out of the ashtray. Is anyone else disgusted with themselves because of this?

7.  Do you also have a clean kitchen?  I feel the need to do everything I've been putting off.  Including ending friendships.  Is this normal?

*edit* I can't count.  Also, I'm itchy.  My nose is itchy, my skin is itchy, my jaw hurts from clenching. This sucks.

*another edit* I caved.  I drove across town to bludge four smokes from a friend. I am in the process of resetting my badge. Things I learned (again!):

* I could smell the cigarettes on my friend and it's a really pervasive and unpleasant smell.  No wonder non-smokers don't generally date smokers.
* It tastes vile.
* Dirty ashtrays are disgusting.

If my dad can quit...

My dad started smoking when he was 11. He has been a 2 pack a day smoker since then. After 48 years, he quit. He really, actually quit! 

I can do this! I only have 1/8th the years under my belt, after all. 

P.S. Trying to imagine my dad w/o a cigarette in his hand is like, the WEIRDEST thing ever. 

P.p.s. 50 hours in. Definitely want to strangle someone right now.

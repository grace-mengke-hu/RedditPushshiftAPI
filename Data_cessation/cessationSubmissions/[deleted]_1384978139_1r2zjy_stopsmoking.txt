Just threw out my pack for what feels like the 1,000th time.

I'm kind of at my wit's end over here.

I just ran outside for a smoke and it started pouring, but I still stood there to finish my cigarette. Now I'm sitting in the office, smelling awful and soaking wet, to boot. I hate this so much, I just threw out my pack for what feels like the 1,000th time.

I've tried quitting so many times- I read Allen Carr's book at least 3 times, tried patches, gum, and e-cigs, have tried cold turkey several times but I always come back to smoking. I hate it, and I want to be done with it, and I feel so weak for not being able to kick this incredibly stupid, dangerous, and costly addiction. I'm trying again ..... but does anyone have any advice? Has anyone succeeded after being in a similar situation?

Please help :(

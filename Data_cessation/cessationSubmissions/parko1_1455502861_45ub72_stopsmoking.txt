Chuffed

394 days. I am in such a great place now i dont smoke i clearly forgot my one year anniversary.
Looking back after smoking for near 30 years with numerous failed attempts i can honestly say i cant ever remember feeling better.
I havent had a cold or sniffle for a year
I have had the desire to exercise regularly
I can breathe better
I smell better
I have heaps more money 
My fingers are not stained yellow
etc etc etc etc.......
If anyone is considering quitting i can tell you from the heart that it will be one of the best things you will ever do and the rewards are countless.

After 33 years of a 2-3 pack a day habit,

today makes 15 months without a cigarette.
 Drinking water every time I wanted a cigarette really helped. Do whatever works for YOU to quit because it can be done. Good luck to all who are trying to quit and stay strong to those of you who are recent quitters.

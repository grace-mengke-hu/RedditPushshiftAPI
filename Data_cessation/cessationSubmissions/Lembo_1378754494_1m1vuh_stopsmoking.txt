Day three!

I made it to day three! The hardest day was yesterday and if I felt like that today I would probably buy some cigs... But today, I feel better already! The urge to smoke is still there and I don't doubt that there will come days like yesterday... Still want to get rid of this addiction and browsing this subreddit really helps so I thought to share my experiences as well. Good luck everyone!

Sad and want a cig

My sister died in early dec. Her hubby and i were getting together at least 1 time a week for dinner and checking in. He's now dating someone and I haven't seen or heard from him in over 2 weeks... I just saw a pic of them on face book and all I can do is cry. I know if I have a cig I will still be sad but it's so hard right now. 
I do believe life is for the living and o do want him happy  but he's falling so hard and it's so soon. 
I miss her so much and now I don't even have him....

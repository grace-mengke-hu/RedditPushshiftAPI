Today is day 1

I'm finding it difficult. I started smoking when I was 16 and I'll be 25 in 2 weeks. I quit cold turkey when I was pregnant but picked it back up after 6 weeks pp. I took big step for myself today and threw away my smoking jacket. This jacket was what I wore when I smoked and when I look at it I think about smoking so I took it out to the garbage. My husband is quitting with me this time around and I'm hoping we can keep each other on track. I'm in the process of throwing away anything that reminded me of cigarettes. I'm hoping this helps.

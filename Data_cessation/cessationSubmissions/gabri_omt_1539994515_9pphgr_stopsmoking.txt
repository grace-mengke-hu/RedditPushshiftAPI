Time for change

We know, we perfectly know what we do everytime we light on a puff. It's so wrong if you stare to think on it.
Anyway, the caption was on changing. Get free of this fear, cause life is Such an incredible thing to get wasted running on smoke, that's it.
Go on if you already started, for who, Like me, have spent too much time saying 'the last" try to ask you what is really  important and how to reach it.

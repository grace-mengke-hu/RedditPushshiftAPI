24 hours smoke-free. Feeling good and bad.

Hey guys, first time posting in here since I was waiting to post until I actually decided to quit. I just hit my 24 hour mark a few minutes ago. I've been smoking since I was 16 and I'm 30 now. Been having issues with my heart lately, and decided to quit cold turkey, without any planning. 

I just finished my pack yesterday, and decided I'm just not going to buy another one. I've quit a couple times in the past, but nothing ever really stuck, and I would smoke a cig here and there randomly thinking it was ok, until I just started smoking again full time.

I hope this time is different. I don't want to do this anymore... I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time, and having to separate myself from my friends and family since no one else smokes. 

My husband hates that I smoke, but I'm not doing it for him... I'm doing it for me. However, I wish he was more supportive and positive, and would be more encouraging during this difficult time.

If someone could maybe message me once in awhile with some encouraging words, advice, or just checking to see how I'm doing... I think that will really help with my success. 

Best of luck for anyone else thinking of quitting, or still struggling with the withdrawals. This is one hell of a journey, but I know it'll be worth it if I can just stick to it. I regret ever picking up that first cigarette 14 years ago. 

Sorry for the long post, I guess I'm just rambling since I'm obviously dealing with withdrawals.

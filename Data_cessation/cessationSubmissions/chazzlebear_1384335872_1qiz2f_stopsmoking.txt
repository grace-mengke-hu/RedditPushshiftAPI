Need some advice/education on how smoking may have affected me and how much worse it could get

Hello /r/Stopsmoking!

I've been smoking for 2 years now (now age 20), 5 a day first year now up to 10-15 a day this year. I haven't noticed much difference in health, I don't feel "unhealthy", small amount of coughing more often and a bit of phlegm here and there, sense of smell is okay. 

I have tried to stop cold turkey many times - failed. Also tried using e-cigarettes, this worked here and there but wasn't amazing. 

My problem is I use smoking to take breaks from the office/lab (on placement atm at a pharmaceutical company), because work gets a bit boring here and there, and its always nice to have a break from everybody here. If I come into work (~08:30) with no cigarettes and I can't get any until lunch time (~13:00) I usually get very irritable and start eating more/chewing up pens. 

Any advice/tips/education you guys can give me?

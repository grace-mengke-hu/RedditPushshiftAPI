My One Year Analysis

When I was first starting out by browsing this subreddit, the anniversary posts kind of intimidated me. 

This isn't a bragging or "good for me" post, this is just an analysis of my experience. I'm never smoking again, and I don't need to post about it to feel good -- I've already felt good for this entire year. 

Let me first tell you that this past year of stopping smoking cigarettes was not easy. Overcoming an addiction isn't something that should be described with the word “easy”. However, I don’t want you to think of it as a dichotomy and being “difficult” either. Think of it as a process. *An experience*.

Our bodies are absolutely mind-blowing. Scientists nowadays are still having trouble creating functioning mechanical robots, let alone replicate anything *close* to the amazing physical statures we are so lucky to have. To delve into a few of the fascinating abilities our bodies have, and one element we hold which is relevant to this addiction, is the ability to heal itself into its "natural state" -- the way we were born!. When we fall and scrape our knees, our bodies so finely mend the wound. In one-two weeks our knees are completely fine again. If anything, we may have a scar there, which ultimately prevents that same wound from happening again. That area in our knee is stronger. Our bodies are amazing healing machines.

If we wake up one morning with the flu, our immune systems, our bodies, fight against it to return back to normal. Depending on a few factors, the majority of us feel completely normal again in about a week. Feeling better than ever.

If we are sad because of a break up, a lost friendship, or any other emotional situation we may experience, with time and effort, we are able to grow stronger from the experience (I understand this may be subjective with depression or mental disorders). If anything, the experience desensitized us from feelings of negativity and we are more stronger and experienced to prevent the hurt from happening again or recover even quicker the next time it may occur.

This is no different with our brains and addictions to nicotine. Those of us who smoke have a physical dependency on a drug, a substance, *a chemical*. Our brain relies on this chemical to enter into our nervous and neurological system to *feel normal*. Were we born with this reliance? Is this necessity for the chemical to feel like “ourselves”, or “normal” after a “craving”, biological, innate? 

**No**. We started this reliance, and we can certainly stop it.

If you stop smoking, trust your body. Trust it’s amazing abilities that have yet to be explained by modern man and science in full. You will heal. Your mind and body will return to its natural state of never needing nicotine or any other substance your cigarette is filled with to feel normal. *Let your knee heal*.

My point with these examples is that our minds, bodies, and souls have a reset button. When you are in the midst of experiencing this fight with addiction, always try to remember this about ourselves. Do you think people who have smoked for years, such as myself (a pack a day for seven to be exact), woke up one morning deciding to quit and haven’t looked back since? *I have looked back*. Trust me. And you will too. However, it depends on how you perceive the looking back aspect of wanting to regress. See it as progress. 

This was not a straight road. There were turns. Crazy forks in the road. Lost directions. But never a U-turn. I did not touch the cigarette because I knew I would just revert to my old life of inconvenience, necessity, and codependence. 

There have been so many bumps in the road for me this past year. There have been times of stress, relaxation, happiness, sadness, uneasyness, anxiety, bliss, euphoria. But I learned that this had nothing to do with smoking cigarettes -- it's what life naturally is: a rollercoaster of feelings and experiences. *It is normal*. Do I still get "cravings"? I dont like this word at all, because it isn't me longing for a cigarette anymore. What I thought were "cravings" this past year have turned into merely times of normal feelings of stress. Once again, *normal*. Stress is normal. Everyone feels it. We all learn methods of coping with stress, it is something every single human being has to achieve. We all feel deadlines at work, with bills, or in school. *We all feel it*, even those who have never touched nicotine before.

Do I still *think* about cigarettes? Rarely. Perhaps I do with the slight smirk I get when I see my best friend go outside every 45 minutes at work to get his fix, looking down at the concrete, only to return to the office smelling like stale charcoal and coughing mucus and clearing his throat every 3 minutes. Maybe when i'm out drinking at the bars and I see everybody huddled up in the cold while i'm too busy inside talking to a pretty girl (usually to get turned down, but hey at least I tried! :)). Or maybe it's when I just got a car wash and I install my new air freshner and smile knowing that it will smell and feel this fresh and clean for the next month.


A handful of times I've been asked the question, "hey buddy, you got a lighter?" I smile and say, "sorry bud, there's a gas station down the street if you want to get some matches".

I could write for hours you guys, I really could. But I don’t want to make this a TLDR’er, even though it already is. If you took the time to read this, thank you. And if you ever need to talk, vent, or have questions, PM me. I love talking about this because it ~~is~~ was a part of my life for so long.

**TLDR: Keep going.**

Target quit day was yesterday... 5 cigarettes doesnt make me a smoker, right?

Joking in the title obv, but basically I've been smoking since I was 13, ol newports, fluctuating between a pack a day and half of that until now (coming on 22) but basically uni of pen is paying me to quit smoking (aka test out a possible placebo to see the effects of weight gain after i quit) no disqualifications if i dont quit, but its the whole goal lol. i never pictured myself quitting despite having really bad lung problems but the fact of the matter is i need to lol. the worst part is the morning cigarettes, the lack of cognitive function, and the physical pain. i gotta go nicotine free personally or else ik im just gonna want cigarettes more, its happened during other "cut down" attempts. my goal to push my AM cig off as long as possible is to wake up and drive to the Wawa to slam a red bull and eat a slim jim. not technically "healthier" but better for my lungs lol. wish me luck, im sure ill be around.

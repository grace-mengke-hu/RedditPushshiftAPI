People who are suicidal/that self harm, how did you quit?

I mention this only because it makes all "smoking kills" talk effectively useless. At the moment the only motivation i have is financial (a pack is 13 euro) but i don't buy packs so frequently that this is a huge issue. I went unintentionally smoke-free yesterday after a horrific day the day before (smoked like 12, i was about to attempt suicide at the time and didnt really give a shit) but today the cravings were back and i'm after having one. Any advice?

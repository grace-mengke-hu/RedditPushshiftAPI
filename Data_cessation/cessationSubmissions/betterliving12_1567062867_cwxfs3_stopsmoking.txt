Ruined it on my two week anniversary!

I had an argument with my boyfriend and on my way to work stopped at the gas station and brought a pack, Ive had an increasing number each day, started with two and then three, now four today ðŸ˜‘
I gave them to a co worker to hold onto but I have easy access to them, I need to get back on the wagon! 
I stopped taking Champix 4 days ago, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s specifically that but itâ€™s of course wearing off so Iâ€™m going to have to start at day 1 all over again. So disappointed in myself.

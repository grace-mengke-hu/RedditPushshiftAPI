Quit date set for Wednesday! Have a new approach and plan this time around.

I've posted before...but I've managed to quit and stay quit for several weeks quite a few times. But by golly, I'm determined to get this down! 

Typically I quit cold turkey, eat a bunch of junk, and chug water. Try to sleep as much as I can.

This time around, I'll be sleeping and chugging water, but I'd like to try things a bit differently. I've been developing a meditation and journaling routine, as well as reading Allan Carr and self-care books. Tuesday, I'll be throwing out all lighters, cleaning the car, washing the clothes, and picking up stray butts around the yard.

I'd like to try more of a holistic approach rather than just barreling through. I also think it'd be good for me to try to stay in touch with this community. I'll have to double check, but maybe there's an accountability or check-in post I can touch base with daily. 

I'm 23, and have been smoking 10 years. I want this to be a phase that I'm leaving behind as I get older. I never believed that this would be a life long habit, and I'm baffled I've let it go on this long. In the past, I don't think I've taken quitting all that seriously...but the more I read and pay attention to my behavior, I'm seeing this as a very real addiction to a substance, and it's scaring me! I don't like feeling so out of control. Here's to giving it my best. Wish me luck!

Another day, another try

I'm 24 years old and I've been smoking for more than 8 years now. Lately I'm working from home and I've started smoking almost two packs a day. I'm really tired of that awfull habbit and I really really really want to get rid of it.

I've been trying to stop smoking in the last week, but I always keep sabotaging myself with the "I'm just gonna smoke one" bullsh*t which always leads to another pack on the next day. I don't know why, but the tought of not smoking anymore is kind of daunting to me, because I'm so used to it and it's a big part of my routine by now.

I'm really glad that I found this reddit page, because everyone here is so supportive and I really need that to leave that addiction behind me. My family is kind of over it by now since I've tried stopping so many times and I always come back to it, so when I tell them that I'll stop, they're like "Yeah, yeah, we've heard that before".

Because at the moment it's hard to imagine not smoking anymore, I've decided to change my approach this time. At the moment my goal is to just not smoke tomorrow. When that passes (hopefully successfull), my next goal would be to not smoke the day after that and so on untill the cravings get easier to deal with.

Good luck to everyone who's on that journey to a better life and hopefully I'll be able to share a positive story in the future as many people on here continue to do and keep motivationg others to stop smoking!

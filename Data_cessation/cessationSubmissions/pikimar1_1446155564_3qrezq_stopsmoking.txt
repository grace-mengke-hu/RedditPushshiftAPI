I guess it will never change?..

Hi. 

Not going to do any bitching, but will those thoughts about smoking ever stop? Well, as you see i'm on 31 day and today more than ever I wanted to smoke. Nothing special happened. Nothing triggered this. I just thought I wanted a cigarette badly. Just like that. I thought I was over it but I guess not :/ 

Didn't do it thou. I've already learned that I can manage this but duuuuh. If this thoughts will hunt me for the rest of my life I guess fuck it... Earlier I was prisoner of a habit of smoking, now I will be prisoner of habit of fighting not to smoke... Either way is a struggle. Please just tell me what I want to hear...

edit: I'm happy I quit and will stick with it but it will be a letdown if this struggle will go forever :/

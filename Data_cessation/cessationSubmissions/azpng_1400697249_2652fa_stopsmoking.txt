Day 4, cravings are bothering me

My addicted mind is trying it's damnedest to tell me how easy it has been to not smoke these past few days, and how I should reward myself with a cigarette, because what's the harm right?

The thing is, I really want to take a smoke break of some sort. I want something that doesn't perpetuate my nicotine addiction and instead is something I can do when I need to walk around the block and think. Something I can do to take a break from work. I really want something.

It's the act of taking puffs, the act of blowing smoke rings. I miss those things probably more than the nicotine itself.

I've been tempted to get a vaporizer with a no-nicotine fluid to hand the oral fixation. I dunno, I'm just stressed and need something.

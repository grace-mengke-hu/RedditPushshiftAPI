I'm not an expert at all, but this is what is working for me.

I've smoked for over half of my life. I had woven cigarettes into everything I did. Wake up, cigarette, shit, shower, cigarette, get dressed, drove to the train station while smoking a cigarette, waiting for the train, cigarette, got to work, cigarette, ate breakfast, cigarette, checked my emails, cigarette, got stressed during a task, cigarette, finished a task, cigarette, anytime i walked outdoors (lunch, meeting, whatever), cigarette, after meals, cigarette, walking back to the train station, cigarette, getting off the train, cigarette, waiting for anything, cigarette. I would come inside from having a cigarette at work and my coworker would be going outside, and I'd say fuck it and go back out with them. It pleased my brains' reward center because I would light up as soon as I was done with ANYTHING. TV show over? Cigarette. Done with the lawn, cigarette. I would literally finish anything and reward myself with cigarette. I fly to a new destination for my birthday every year and would have myself a birthday cigarette and reflect on my past year during it and would literally sing happy birthday to myself in my head. Just hangout on the beach somewhere, or balcony, or by the river. In my head it would be my own 5 minutes of peace on my birthday, away from everyone.

So I've tried to quit over the years at the suggestions of others (mostly ex girlfriends), but failed to do so because I didn't want to, they did. I wanted to quit for them, not for me. I quit shortly after my birthday and I did it because I told myself at 14 that I'd be done by this age. 

Currently, I'm on step 1 Nicoderm and I chose it because I want to break the following physical habits first:
* Hand to mouth motion.
* Bypassing the oral fixation. 
* Getting up from my desk every 45 to 60 minutes.
* Getting up from whatever I was doing. 
* Learning life without these tiny breaks. 
* Learn to not reward myself after everything I do. 
* Learn to drink without smoking.

I'm not chewing gum because I don't want to replace one habit with another. I know about satisfying that oral fixation, but with these patches, I'm not having many cravings other than when I wake up. I take the patch off during my shower and put on a new one within 15 minutes. 
At this point: 
* I'm at 22 days, 8 hours and 36 minutes. 
* $268.31 saved
* 447 not smoked
* "Your circulation improves and walking becomes easier, even your lung function increases up to 30%".
* 4.4719 grams of tar avoided.

4 fucking grams!?!?

I'm using an app called "Quit it" and it's pretty awesome. Initially I would look at my app during a craving and was like holy shit, $50 saved. The dollar amounts started growing as I continued, but as time went on, I found it easier to get past cravings, therefore I didn't look at the app as often.

I find the patch to be very helpful because I can learn life without tiny breaks and simultaneously not mentally think about cigarettes. And each craving denied makes the next one easier to deal with. I was initially afraid to drink alcohol because I smoke a lot more when drinking. These patches make it easy to get through the evening without thinking about wanting a cigarette.

Things get hard sometimes

I quit for almost two years last time, then I lost a good friend, my mother in law, another good friend, and my dog, and I caved.  I’m now over two months smoke free again.

My wife just lost her job. I just quit my job to start a new one next week. This was supposed to be my first week-long break in forever to enjoy by myself, not worry about anything, and recharge.  Instead, I’m going on hour six of an anxiety attack.

It takes everything I have to not go buy that useless pack of death for five minutes of “relief”.  My chest hurts, my head hurts...just trying so hard not to let this be an excuse.

Thanks for listening.

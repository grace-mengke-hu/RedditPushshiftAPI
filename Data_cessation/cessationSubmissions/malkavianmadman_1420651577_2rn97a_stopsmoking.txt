Day 3 about to begin.

So day 3 is about to begin for me. Going cold turkey even. I feel pretty good though I didn't sleep so well last night. Yesterday was ok too but the morning was really hard, but thats what I should expect from pay days.

EDIT: and I just realised my badge still says 1 day. am I doing somethign wrong?

Boredom, my greatest enemy!

So I am now on attempt #2 now at attempting to quit. I tried late last year, went through a good week and a half getting beaten to a pulp by withdrawal symptoms, and managed about a little short of a month before I caved back in due to some unexpected sudden stress.

I'm about 5 days in on my second attempt now, on a whim going completely cold turkey just like my first time, and it's going decently so far aside from the wonderful withdrawal symptoms. My lungs feel like they're dying from what I guess is my body attempting to fix them up a bit, and I've almost completely lost my voice from all the constant coughing due to it.

All that is fine though, my biggest problem is boredom. A good part of the reason I've been smoking for so long is just as "something to do". I get bored constantly and very very easily, so I'm constantly smoking just so that I have something to keep myself occupied, and every major urge I've gotten to start smoking again during this attempt has been out of just pure boredom. I have a feeling if this attempt fails, that's going to wind up being the cause. Anybody have any ideas on what I can do as a replacement for smoking during these constant "I'm bored so I should go smoke" moments?

Ex-smokers who actually saved the money they would have spent on smoking, what did you do with the money?

We always see the motivational “how much you saved!” figure in our cessation apps, but has anyone actually put away the money they would have spent? I do notice more money in my wallet at the end of the week (NYC is $9-15 a pack) but nothing I’ve ever set aside.

For those who quit and saved, what did you do or plan to do with the money?  Has it helped motivate you or is it a bonus you keep on the back burner?

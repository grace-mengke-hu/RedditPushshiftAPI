Increased mucous the morning after social smoking/vaping

Back when I smoked, it was extremely light during the week (one a day often) and then it would spike up on the weekends to maybe a half pack on a Friday/Saturday if I was social. The morning after those heavy smoking days I could bring up a lot of yellowish mucous and I would have a gross mouth feel until I got hydrated again.

After I stopped having cigarettes I would use a Blu vape to curb cravings if I was out with smokers but really that was the only time. The morning after I would get that same yellow mucous experience although not quite as bad as with cigarettes. I can have a drinking night without the same thing happening so I was wondering if my body had reacted to the vape the same way it treated smoke and would kick up a bunch of the smoke crap in there as a result? Or is it just more of a coincidence and related to being dehydrated more than anything? I haven't read up on vape results to know if vape people get big mucous buildups like smokers do

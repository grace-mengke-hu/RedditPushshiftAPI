I must be an idiot and/or a masochist...

I smoked for 14 years (age 14 to 28) and I quit with the Allen Carr book, 8 years ago. Cold turkey, never looked back, mental work done forever.

And then a few months ago, I don't know what took me, I had a cigarette at a party. "Just to see". It made me sick, light headed, my body clearly rejecting the experience and telling me "dude, you cannot do this stuff anymore". I regretted it instantly. But since then... it's happened again, and not even in social events. I have maybe a cigarette every two weeks, in secret, at night, by myself, when my SO is out of town. I get ZERO enjoyment out of it, but I just do it. I feel disgusted, nauseous, guilty and disappointed with myself every time. Then I put the ashes away, chew gum, wash hands profusely to remove the smell, etc. I'm a 36 years old, father of two and I hide like a teenager to smoke! I completely realize how ridiculous this situation is and I know for sure I would not go back to full-blown smoking because I just hate it. But this is the hamster wheel I am in right now...

Thoughts? Anyone with similar experience?

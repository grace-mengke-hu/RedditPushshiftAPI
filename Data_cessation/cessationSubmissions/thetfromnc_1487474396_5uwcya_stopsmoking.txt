Day 3 on Nicotine Lozenges

I'm attempting to quit smoking, I'm 22 and have been smoking since about 14.  I had gotten to almost 2 packs a day.  I'm using nicotine lozenges, 4 mg and I'm feeling super positive and already feel like I have more energy but I was wondering is the healing of my body reduced because I'm using the lozenges?

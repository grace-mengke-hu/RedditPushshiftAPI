A month later...

almost a month under my belt. and feeling strong.  I smoked since I was 14 and you could buy singles from a garage on the way to and from school. I smoked for 25 years , a lot at uni (about 20 a day) and over the past few years about 5 or 6 a day. I've given up loads of times before but never for this long. whenever I've felt tempted this time I've read  the posts on this forum and the craving has gone. So thanks to all those who are still posting - even after not smoking for a year  your posts are really helping me to stay a non smoker and yes it does get easier for all those new quitters- the cravings are  more memories of places and times I used to smoke they no longer come with the want to smoke.  one day at a time ....

Not the biggest victory, but I'm proud of me, damn it!

I bought a new (used) car exactly a week ago and I decided I am not going to smoke in it, and so far, I haven't!

It's the first real step towards quitting for me. I always thought that breaking the habit of lighting a cig the second I get in my car would be next to impossible. But I'm surprised by how easy it's been. 

I'm afraid to completely quit, but I'm getting there. I want to take baby steps, and not allowing myself to smoke in my car is a huge test for me. It's testing my determination, endurance, and willpower. And if I do smoke in my car, I'll learn to deal with disappointing myself, and that one cig does not mean I can say fuck it, it only means I have to try again.

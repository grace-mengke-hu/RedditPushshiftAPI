24 Hours in! How I actively quit

It's been 24 hours since my last cigarette.

I have been a pack a day smoker for probably close to 20 years. I have been trying to quit for a couple months. 

'Actively' trying to quit, means that when you want a cigarette, you recognize it and 'actively' choose to NOT smoke. You can't just blow it off and relapse.

BUT.. if you do, you have to get right back on the horse and remember... You're trying to quit.

After my relapses, I would take out the cigarettes & lighter and throw them in the trash. Even if there were some in the pack. And I forced myself to remember, I'm trying to quit!

This went on for about 3 days. Quit. Relapse. Quit. Relapse. Yesterday I took the last cigarette out and snapped it between my fingers and said, "I am quitting smoking today!"

Thew the lighter out and haven't smoked since. Thanks reddit!

30 years smoking, 2 days not, all I can do is cry?

I've smoked (on and off) for 30 years and quit for the last time two days ago. I have spent those two days either on the verge of crying or crying. And I am not a crier! I feel like my best friend has moved away and I'll never see them again. I threw away all my already smoked cigarettes so I couldn't pick though and find a halfway smoked one. 

I don't really have any support right now - my husband said literally one statement of encouragement the last time I tried to quit, which I had to ask for. Which is super frustrating as he has gone through his own addiction issues (9 years addiction free for him.) I gave him a lot of support when he was dealing with that, so it's confusing to me how he doesn't return the support? Anyway, I joined a group through my insurance and am waiting for the information, downloaded the Smoke Free app last night, and posted here, so I guess that will be my support.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I don't quite feel like bawling so much now and think I can get out of bed.

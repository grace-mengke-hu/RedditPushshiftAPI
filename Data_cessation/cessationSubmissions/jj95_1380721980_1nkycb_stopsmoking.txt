18yo Decided to quit early

I've been smoking for two years and I've finally just decided THAT'S IT! Just had my last cig and now I'm going cold turkey. I know the main reason should be for my health, but it's not, it's for financial reasons. I have just bought a car and need every little bit to help me and I also live in a flat with my GF so I need to pay for that as well. Also because I live in the UK cigarettes are expensive and  I can't justify paying 30quid (I smoked about 15 a day) a week on them to my GF with all the bills.

I think it's better to quit now than when I'm 20-30-40 years old when I may have caused some major damaged to myself opposed to what ever damage I have already caused. So yeh, I'm quitting, lets see how it goes. I know it's not going to be easy, but I think with a bit of help and being able to talk with other quitters on this subreddit I think I can do it!

EDIT: Cheers for all the support guys! I'm going to use all of the advice given to pack this in for good!

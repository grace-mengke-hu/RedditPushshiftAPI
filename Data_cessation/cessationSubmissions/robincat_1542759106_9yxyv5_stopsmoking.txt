Fatique after quitting

I quit smoking almost 5 months ago using the patch (I smoked for almost 20 years). I'm still on the patch and it's great - I rarely think about smoking and feel like I'm definitely not going to smoke again. I will probably complete the patch process in 2 months. 

But I'm so tired. I read that a lot of people experience fatigue when they first quit, but it's been almost 5 months and it's not getting any better. I went to the doctor for a blood test and am waiting for the results. In the meantime, has anyone else had this experience? Did it get better? Did anything help? If you used the patch, did you find you had more energy as you stepped down/stopped?

Thank you for being you today /stopsmoking

I’ve been smoke free for 29 challenging, but wonderful days. Today has been the biggest hurdle yet: an unexpected breakup from someone whom I was certain is/was the love of my life. To say that this subreddit has probably saved my life today is an understatement, I’ve not only avoided smoking because of you, but your words of encouragement to each other has given me much needed strength to keep going, so thank you for being you today.

Fuck Smoking part 2. Be ever vigilant, AKA, "Man, why are the cravings so intense today?"

Weird how fast things change. I woke up this morning, am sipping on a cup of green tea (no coffee in the house), and I am just having some of the absolute worst cravings at this precise moment since day 4 or 5.

It's because of this that I've avoided alcohol in the past 12 days also. Fact is, I'm not sure I really want to quit. I loved drinking and smoking. Quite a bit, in fact. It was literally one of my favorite things to do.

And now here I am, and I am at a loss for myself. The hardest part is not quitting, the hardest part is reinventing yourself to realize that you are a new person now. Don't let your brain trick you into thinking, "But I loved it". No, you just thought you loved it. That thought is wrong. You were killing yourself the whole time, and you were depressed.

Phew, that feels better.

edit: If you're downvoting me because you disagree with my choice to abstain from alcohol, I invite you to post a comment rather than just downvote due to disagreement. I'm not sure what people dislike about this post. 

edit 2: FUCK smoking.

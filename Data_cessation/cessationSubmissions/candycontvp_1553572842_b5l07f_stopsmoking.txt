Cutting down the dose of the patch tomorrow, what should I expect?

Hi guys, 

I quit smoking a month ago, I started on the 15mg patch and I'm also using the 2mg gum for when cravings get too bad. 
Tomorrow I'm cutting down to the 7 mg patch, and I'll still use the gum for backup. 

What should I expect? I should probably mention that I also battle GAD and I recently lost my job, so I am under stress and anxious. Any tips?

Thank you

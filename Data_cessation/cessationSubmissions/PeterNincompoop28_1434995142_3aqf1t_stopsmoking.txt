So this is day one.

I'm 28 years old, and I've averaged a pack/day for the last 7 years. I have a wife and a beautiful little girl, and they mean everything to me. Lately, I've felt more and more disgusted with this terrible habit of mine. Cigarettes were the reason I lost my father at 22. It's so ridiculous that even after they killed him, I started. The mind copes in strange ways sometimes, I guess. Being a father now myself, I can't stand the thought of this addiction taking me away from my little girl, and to make matters worse, my wife (who put them down cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant) has now started bumming them from me and smoking again for the first time in over 4 years. The guilt I feel from this cannot be measured by conventional means. I'm done with the half-assed attempts to quit. I'm done letting this addiction convince me that smoking is the answer to my stress and problems. I'm done killing myself and putting my family in harm's way for my own selfish reasons. I am here today to finally have some accountability. I am here because I can finally admit to myself that I need help. I've been lurking here for about a week, and everyone here seems really nice and genuinely supportive, so today I finally requested a badge. I won't let down my family, or myself. Today, I am officially a non-smoker. 

P.S. Sorry if this comes off like a lot of rambling. This is my first post to Reddit and I'm feeling pretty raw right now.

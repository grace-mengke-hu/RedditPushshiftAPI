Starting over again

I went just about 11 days with no cigarettes. I fell into the trap again today after a stressful morning and smoked one. The only time I feel capable is when I’m with my bf as he is very strong willed and motivating. Every time I see my mother who smokes I end up falling into my old ways. I try to not see her because I know she influences me but she needs me right now. I don’t know where I’m going with this but I just feel so down and taking care of myself is hard work.

4 Days & 6 Hours and COUNTING!

It's been ridiculously easy for me and I don't really know why but maybe the recent events might have something to do with it?

I stupidly drunkenly&high cheated on my girlfriend 5 days ago, decided to change my life a bit and stopped smoking.

I usually smoke at home and sneak out at night for one, or walk around the block for a bit and have one, but here I haven't wanted a single one!

The only times I've wanted one is when I've been watching a film with someone smoking.

Usually I want it when I'm bored / waiting / generally outside / when I walk past someone who's smoking.

But NOW! The feeling that I know I haven't smoked feels better than the feeling I would get than smoking. I'd love to have a cigarette but then I wouldn't feel very accomplished. 

Maybe my cravings are kicking in, but who knows. Hopefully still going strong.

TL:DR. Stopped smoking, might be craving, split up with gf so had other things on mind to stop cravings. wat.

Tomorrow marks my one year!

After smoking for 10 years I never would've thought I'd make it this far, and now that I'm here I genuinely can't see myself going back. As far as I'm concerned quitting is one of the best decisions I've made to date and has impacted my life in many beneficial ways. One of the most profound and rewarding being that I've helped two other people out from under their addiction by sharing my resources and stories as well as lending an ear to their hardships. I hope I never forget how hard this journey was or learn to think that it was something "I" did. I never would've made it without the support I've had from family/friends and this group. Though I may not have posted in this forum before, I've been lurking the whole year, pulling motivation and inspiration from all of you. Thanks for sharing your stories of success and failure, for being honest with yourselves and us, and for supporting each other. You guys are great and it's been a comfort to be a part of this, even only as a lurker!

First 24 hours

So I've smoked for at least the past 5 years - which is a drop in the bucket compared to some people, but I still feel the need to quit. 

I had my last cigarette yesterday at around 9:30 PM... It's now 9:30 AM and I really desperately want one. This has to be a normal feeling, so what do you suggest I do to curb the feeling? Thing is I tend to smoke a lot at work. It's something to do on breaks so I don't know how I'll handle that change in habit.

I used to be a chronic pot smoker, and I quit that Nov 2 2015 and cigarettes are the next logical step to quit. 

Does anyone have any info or tips on not relapsing into buying a pack? what am I about to experience? Quitting pot was a bit of an emotional roller coaster as my brain was readjusting to not fulfilling the habit. 

any and all discussion is appreciated :)

thanks in advance everyone :)

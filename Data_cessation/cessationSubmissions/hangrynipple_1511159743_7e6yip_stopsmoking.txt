Quitting time?

I'm a 21 year old college student planning on graduating next fall. Every break before a new semester starts I manage to quit smoking and then eventually at some point in the new semester I start smoking again. I tell myself that after I graduate and move away from a college environment it will be easy to quit and never be a problem again. 

Is this realistic? What's it like trying to quit as a smoker in the adult world? I'm gonna give it another go when I go home for Thanksgiving but I'm the back of my mind the addiction is telling me to hold out until I graduate and leave the college environment.

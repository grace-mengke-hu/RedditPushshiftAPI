where to start?

I've been smoking somewhat heavily since the age of 13 or 12, not sure really. I've tried to quit multiple times before, I also drink heavily.

Recently I've decided to stop drinking, and am committing to it. But I find quitting smoking is harder than quitting drinking. Maybe because smoking is generally accepted and is less of a taboo, leading to more frequent smoking than drinking thus being more addicted to it than to alcohol.

Since, I'm quitting drinking, I'm thinking why not smoking too. But having tried to do that before and miserably failing, where do I start, how do I motivate myself? 

I always give up a day or 2 later: "ahh, maybe next time" or "just 1 smoke, whatever"

Or should I do 1 thing at a time? That seems more reasonable to me.

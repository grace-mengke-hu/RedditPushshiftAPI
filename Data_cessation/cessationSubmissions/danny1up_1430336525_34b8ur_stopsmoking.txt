27 year old who doesn't want to be a "10 year smoker"

Been smoking cigs since I was 18 and coming up on a decade of "punching darts".

Starting to wonder why and if it is all really worth it. Cigs here are closing in on $20 a pack and all I am noticing is it is sapping 15 minutes out of my work day (as a delivery driver, that is precious) and making everything I own stink.

My gf is supportive of whatever I do and is a cardio freak. I can keep up with her on good days running but when we do all I can think about is the fact that I am smoking is making it that much harder. I am always up for a challenge but that is pushing it.

I feel like I haven'tt been affected too badly yet but there is gunna be a day that it does...and that scares the shit out of me. Hell, I am writing this at 5:40 am because the anxiety of smoking has me awake thinking about this.

Help. Anyone in a similar situation got any advice for someone who wants to be a better, more active person? This sub seems like where I need to be.

Help me get my 1UP.

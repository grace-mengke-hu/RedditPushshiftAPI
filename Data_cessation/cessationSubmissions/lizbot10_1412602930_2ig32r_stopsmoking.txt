Day 1

Trying this again... I quit last November for about 6 months until stress took over and I started smoking again. About 1/2 a pack per day. I know I can do this, but the cravings right now are absolutely awful! I smoked my last cigarette last night and threw the rest of my pack in the garbage. I kept telling myself "I'll quit after this pack" and just kept buying "one more pack" for the last few months. 

I'm done. I have to be. I don't want to be a "smoker". I started smoking when I was 16 and thought it was cool, and now 11 years later I'm still smoking. My clothes smell, my hands smell, I'm BROKE. 

It's now or never right??

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the support. I get nervous posting in subs like this when I'm in the beginning, thinking people get annoyed of all the Day 1 posts, but I have to say, this is the most supportive and nice subreddit! Thank you all

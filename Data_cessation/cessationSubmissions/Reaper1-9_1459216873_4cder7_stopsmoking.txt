I'm 27 and have been smoking a pack a day for about 10 years.
I recently made a deal with my Mom that I would quit smoking if she gave up her obscene Diet Coke habit.
I set April 1st to be my quit date. I can tell a part of me is ready to quit. Cigarettes aren't tasting as good anymore and I'm sick of waking up feeling 50lbs heavier, like I have a boulder sitting on my chest. However, another part of me loves it. Nothing feels better than that morning smoke with my coffee, or finally getting a chance to go outside at work and smoke.
The only thing I've really done to prepare for this day is I switched to the Marlboro 72's (the short ones) a few months ago. 
I do have Allen Carr's book on audio and I'm about 3/4ths of the way through, but I think I may start over as I don't feel like I've gotten much out of it.
Any last minute tips to prepare me for Friday (my first smoke free day) and the days (and weeks) that follow?

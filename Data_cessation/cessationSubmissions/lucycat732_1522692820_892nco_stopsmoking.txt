This ain't my first rodeo

I just hit 3 months yesterday! I'm definitely proud of myself. But then I opened up my TimeHop app only to see that I also hit this milestone back in 2010. In fact, I made it through ALL of 2010 without a single cigarette, but got sucked back into the nicotine game in 2011. I need this time to be different. And I think it is--this time I have a mindset of this being the absolute end of cigarettes for me, whereas back in 2010 I just wanted to quit "for awhile" and then maybe go back to having one once in awhile. We all know that only snowballs into a full blown addiction. But not this time! I am a non-smoker. I do not smoke and I will not smoke again. Not for special occasions, not ever.

One year smoke-free!

Just wanted to throw out a few tips/observations that might help those of you contemplating quitting or struggling to stay committed:

Allen Carr's book fundamentally changed my understanding of my relationship with cigarettes and is definitely my #1 recommendation, but the book that gave me the final push was an out-of-print gem called [How to Stop Smoking](http://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Smoking-Revised-Edition/dp/0671440497) by Harold Brean.

[This short essay]( http://books.google.com/books?id=84842d5sVowC&lpg=PA167&ots=HzKQsM_FeM&dq=burroughs%20%22how%20you%20stop%20smoking%22&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false) by William S. Burroughs is a review of the above book that provides some helpful insights into quitting.

I recommend quitting at the beginning of a weekend when you have nothing on your schedule. Try to sleep as much as you can those first couple of days.

You do not have to worry about enduring a lifelong struggle against the urge to backslide. I know it's hard to believe when you are still addicted to smoking, but after a few months of being a non-smoker, I could go weeks at a time without even thinking about smoking. At this point, I only bother to reflect on my former addiction when I see an explicit reference to cigarettes in the media.

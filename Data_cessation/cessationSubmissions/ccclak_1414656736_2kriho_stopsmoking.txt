Anxiety and quitting

So I'm really wanting to quit smoking, but I'm nervous because I htave a severe anxiety disorder and dont want to make it worse. I've heard of people developing anxiety disorders once they quit. Does anyone else have some experience to share? Preferably someone who has bad GAD/PD and quit? Thanks!


Edit: thanks guys for all of your positive stories, I actually feel better about trying to quit now. I hope it lessens the anxiety like most of u said it did!

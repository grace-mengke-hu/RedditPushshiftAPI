Quitting sunday, just want to talk.

So, I have smoked on and off for roughly 8 years. It just hit me recently exactly how long I have been smoking. Every year I would say "I haven't been smoking long, I'll quit soon..." and now it has been YEARS.

I recently quit cold-turkey for 8 weeks while traveling for work, and upon arrival went out with my friends for a weekend of fun. They are all smokers, and with the drinking, I had ONE cigarette. That cigarette turned into 1-2 packs a day again.

I really want to quit, and am going to do so Sunday, cold-turkey again. I am going out tomorrow night, so I know it will be pretty much impossible while drinking, so I've scheduled my quit day as Sunday.

It is hard to quit, but not impossible for me. The hardest thing is being able to have a few beers with friends without breaking down and continuing. 

I don't want to lose the fun times I have, but I guess I'm going to just have to stop drinking as much on my weekends.

Thanks for listening! Just felt like getting everything in writing so I can remember and follow my plans.

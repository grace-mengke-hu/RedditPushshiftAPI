Please help my dad quit smoking

I'm a 14 year old guy. My dad doesn't smoke when he's in public, but he smokes secretly at mid night, when I should be sleeping in my room. But I know he's smoking every night. Do you guys know any good tips how I can help my dad quit smoking?

P.S Yes, I have talked about smoking with my dad, he says that it is very hard to quit smoking...

Significantly cut back, but still can't drop a few!

Wife and I have gone from a pack and a half each per day to 3-4 per day with the assistance of patches. We're having a hard time giving up a couple of those cigarette pairings (with morning coffee, after big meal, before bed, etc). We gave up the car cigarettes (my biggest trigger), but we just keep smoking those few cigarettes a day.

I'm not really stressed about it. We've been working on this for a few weeks, and we are both determined to quit, it's just taking longer than I intended. Regardless, 20 years is too long to have been smoking when you're only 31.

Funny side note, I recently had to serve 10 days in the county jail (for some dumb stuff, nothing horribly criminal), and I had no problem not smoking knowing that I absolutely couldn't smoke. My wife started the patches when I went in, I just went cold turkey and I was fine. Completely fine. I got out and smoked one cigarette (my mistake) and I've been having a hell of a time since. Knowing that I can go buy a pack is killing me.

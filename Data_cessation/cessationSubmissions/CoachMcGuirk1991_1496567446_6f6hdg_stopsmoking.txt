My plan

This might be a long post wanted to vent and put some accountability on myself, sorry in advance. 

Hey I'm new here, I recently quit drinking almost a month ago, used the stop drinking sub and it helped a lot. Since then I haven't quit smoking, even though I've really wanted to and tried a few times getting only to day two.

The reasons I want to quit are plentiful, I want to not worry about my health or heart, I want to lose weight (smoking makes it really hard for me to work out), I want to be in a meaningful relationship again, I want to have more confidence and self-esteem.

I am worried mostly about anxiety, stressful situations, and other things that can cause me to start again. 

My plan is to stop after this pack, no aids, cold turkey, and I plan on this being the last time I have nicotine again in my life. 

Any tips and advice would be appreciated. 

I'll be back in a few days for a badge ðŸ™‚

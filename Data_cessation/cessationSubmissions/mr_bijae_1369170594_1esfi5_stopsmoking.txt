Today I go back to 1!!!

Not because I had a cigarette, but because I made it 30 days and I change from a coin to a star!!! One Full Month with no cigarettes!! Last night I even went to the casino and gambled a bit. This place has often been one of my triggers, people smoking around you cocktails flowing. I was there for about three hours and I felt nothing. No hate, no disdain, no longing, no reminiscing, nothing. It really did shock me that I wasn't fighting the desire. The desire just wasn't there!  This time it ~~could~~ will stick!

Starting over at one.. MONTH!! YEE HAA

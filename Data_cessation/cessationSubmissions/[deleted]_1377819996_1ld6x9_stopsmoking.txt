My reminder to you as a current smoker.

I am no happier than I was before I relapsed. After you have that one cigarette, life goes back to just the way it was before, except worse because now you're a smoker again. I thank you all for the support you've given me so far. I'm finishing Carr's book again and have set my new quit date for Saturday. I can do it this time. 

EDIT: Thanks again everyone for the encouragement!

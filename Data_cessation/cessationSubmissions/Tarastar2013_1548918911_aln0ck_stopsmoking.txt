Help, need to quit smoking.

Okay so I smoked for years before hand and I ended up quitting for almost 5 Years. About 3 months ago I went out with a friend and I forgot my CBD vape pen. I thought oh what the heck I'm going out drinking I'm going to want to have a couple puffs here and there, big mistake. I ended up buying a pack of cloves and it's been about 4 months.

I really do want to quit, not to mention I need to quit due to quite a few medical issues. Obviously I know smoking is bad for me and my health. I think the biggest problem right now is I'm still really enjoying it. I have one left in my pack , I'm smoking it now. I'm not going to buy another pack.

People that successfully quit smoking how did you do it , how did you fight the urge, how did you keep your mind occupied and where they're things that helped you more than others. I know this isn't going to be a walk in the park, but like I said my health is on the line. I don't have a choice I have to quit.

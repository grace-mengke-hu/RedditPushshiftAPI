Saving money

So, motivated by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/15w0hx/not_even_a_year_off_and_i_already_bought_a_small/) and a conversation with a PA that gave me Zyban years ago, I've started a new habit.  Every morning I go to my bank account and transfer the money I would have spent on cigarettes ($4.50 for me, $5.00 for my wife) from my checking account to my savings account.  So far it's only $23.50, but I have goals.  I also want a Miata (or a 280zx) to run around town in.  Just need to convince the wife that our new found money should be used for another car and not something important like house repairs.

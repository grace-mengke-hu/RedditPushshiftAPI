It’s been 6 days since my last cig and I want to drop the Juul, too.

Recessed gums, deep gum pockets, and significant dental bone loss are what finally got me to quit (23 years, 1 pack/day). But the nicotine’s the thing when it comes to gums. I’m nervous about quitting the Juul. Time to cut up some straws I guess!

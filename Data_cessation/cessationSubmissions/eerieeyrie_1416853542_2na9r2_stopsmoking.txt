In 22 days, I am having all 21 of my teeth removed, and getting dentures. I am 25 years old.

Edit: I have taken a picture of my teeth. It is at the very end of this post. If you have sensitive teeth, or are squeamish, don't look. Don't say I didn't warn you. Posting this picture is the hardest thing I think I've ever done.

Warning: this is going to be rather long, and I might be kind of weepy. I am a rambler when I type, but I really need to get it all off my chest... Its almost masochistic for me to actually post this, since a part of me expects to get a lot of angry responses or some much... I don't know, its hard to explain. I fear what other people think of me, and I don't expect you'll be thinking any good things. Or maybe I'm crazy. But if even only one person reads this, and takes away something from my mistakes, then it will all be worth it.


Reader's discretion is advised.


TL;DR: Go brush your teeth. Don't smoke. Stay strong. Because I didn't, and I did, and I'm not, and this is the story of what happens. Don't walk this path.


Let me start by saying that smoking is only one factor of this equation, but it is definitely a part of this.


**1:** Genetics. This would have happened to me one way or another... Bad teeth just run in my family, even in the non smokers. I never grew several of my adult teeth, just wasn't born with them. I had baby teeth that weren't removed until 18 and the damage they caused became irreversible quite quickly. Without smoking, I may have saved myself another year or a few, but combined with #s 2 and 3... Well, I am where I am now.


**2:** Lack of care, beginning in my younger years. I assure you, I am not disillusioned. I did this to myself. This is all my fault. I'd like to say I have justifible reasons... I grew up almost totally devoid of health insurance or care. Sure, when something happened, we went to a doctor or dentist... but at unbelievable cost. I don't recommend growing up in/near poverty, I speak from both past and current experience. But I digress... In my early teens, I went through several traumatic experiences; I'm not sure I want to share entirely what went on, let's just say 'custody issues' and leave it at that. 


I've struggled with severe depression for more then half my life. The silent kind of depression, the one where you try so hard to be happy, because you should be happy, you have every reason to BE happy, but you're not. You constantly smile and are too quick to laugh, for fear of somebody noticing how... off you are. How dead inside. There were times I was okay. There were times where I wasn't. It would descend on me like a storm... It's hard to describe this way, and I'm probably butchering it, but I'm sure you get the point. (I'd just like to say that I've come a long way from where I was... The past 4-5 years I've been much better.)


But during those times... I almost never brushed my teeth. I don't know why, so don't ask me. I just didn't. If I could go back in time and give myself a swift kick in the ass, or at least a smack upside the head... In a heart beat.


As a matter of fact, I need YOU to do me a favor. Do yourself a favor.


*Go brush your teeth.*

*Right now.*

You can come back to reading this in a moment, I'll wait.

Thanks.


Seriously though, dental care is important. 


I say this because I would NEVER wish what I am going through right now on anyone, ever.


**3:** Smoking.


I hate cigarettes. So much. They've brought me nothing but pain, and still I am a slave to them. I am a person of passions: my anger can be quick to flame, and I hate that too. I am terrified of the person I might become without cigarettes, during the withdrawal period. I think that is what has stopped me from quitting thus far.


Again, if I could go back in time... *shakes head*


Smoking would be a lot easier to quit if I'd never started. But I can't change that. Can't change the past. Not for smoking, not for my teeth, not for my depression, not for all the horrible things I've been through. Those things live in the past. I cannot change them. 


I have to change the future.


But its hard, and I'm scared, and I need help. Please, if you've made it this far in my ramblings... Lend me your strength for a moment. I need words of advice, words of encouragement... Anything. I just need to know I'm not alone. That I'm not crazy. 


My surgery is on December 15th. I'm excited and I'm terrified. I haven't truly smiled in 7 years. I 'smile' all the time, sure, with my lips closed. I haven't grinned, with teeth showing, in years... Unless it was behind my hand. Nobody wants to see that.


Have I mentioned that every one of my top teeth is broken? My molars are so eroded they are nonexistent. My canines broke off 2ish years ago... My front left tooth broke two weeks ago... the right one followed on Thursday, it snapped while I was sleeping...


I don't know if you can imagine what this is like. If you can, if you know, then I'd give you a hug right now if I could. But if you can't imagine it, if you have lovely teeth, or even halfway decent teeth... All I ask is you not judge me too much. I'm actually a very nice person, or I try to be, I really do... 


I want to quit smoking on December 1st. I am down to 5-7 a day. I can do this.


Please help me do this.

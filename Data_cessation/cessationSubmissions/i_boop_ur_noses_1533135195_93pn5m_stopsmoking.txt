What did you not pay/invest/buy because you spent money on cigs regularly?

We all spent a lot of $$$ on cigs even though not all of us are rich, including me. 
I could have paid my cc debt completely if I didnt spend money on cigs daily
I could have paid for uber on days I didn't feel like traveling on public transport,but I chose cigs instead
I could have paid to spruce up my apartment that I've been postponing with the reason 'I dont have money left'

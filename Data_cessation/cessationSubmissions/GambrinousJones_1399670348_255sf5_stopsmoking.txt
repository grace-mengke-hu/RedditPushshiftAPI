Any depressed smokers quit with bupropion?

Hey. I've had mixed depression and anxiety for years, but I didn't start smoking cigarettes specifically until December of 2012. This last winter was my last really difficult term of college. I was taking 19 credits of 400-level engineering classes and almost didn't make it out alive. I was smoking a pack a day and have been doing half a pack to a whole pack ever since. 

I've been on bupropion, indicated for depressed smokers, for about 4 days. They say you should take it for about two weeks before attempting to quit. I've read a few accounts on other sites about being successful with it. Any good experiences here?

Edit: bupropion is the generic form of Wellbutrin, aka Zyban, because I shouldn't expect people to just know this.

I fell off the wagon, but I just passed my three day mark. Tea tree oil tooth picks are my savior!

I've been hanging out with my smoker friends, drinking, generally carrying on like usual, but I haven't accepted any nicotine into my body in over 72 hours. every time I get a craving I chew on a tea tree oil toothpick and it works wonders! Quitting smoking is so easy for me now! I'm so excited!

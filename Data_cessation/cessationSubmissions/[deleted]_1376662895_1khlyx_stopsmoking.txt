No cigarette since 8/13/2013!

I just got really tired of cigarettes. I never wanted to be a smoker, I always liked the idea of dipping more... Plus fewer health issues... and cheaper... and no lingering smoke smell, so that's what I'm doing. I'm fully converted to dip or whole leaf chew at this point and honestly don't crave a cigarette. Use to be I'd wake up and have to smoke a cigarette within 5 minutes. I can go around 2 hours before I ever feel the urge to put a lip in and then it isn't overwhelming, just like 'huh, wintergreen' - so that method has worked for me but I wouldn't advise it for everyone. Some people want to quit nicotine entirely, I just want to quit smoking.

But I am confused, starting Tuesday I've been sick. Stopped up or runny nose, sore throat, coughing up nasty shit. I made a doctor's appointment for this morning but I woke up feeling fine... Just a little cough, sounds normal and not producing a ton of crap and my nose is only mildly congested. Could this be the quitter's flu/cold or just allergies from the weather changing (from 90's to high 70's and low 60's at night)? 

Thanks and good luck!

Will quitting smoking make me calmer and help with anxiety?

I've been smoking since I was roughly 14. I started heavily smoking a pack a day around 18, 19 and I am now 21. I have gone 4 days without a cigarette. I find myself to be an anxious person, especially in social situations, and I find myself so much better when I'm just by myself, me and my cigarettes. But I don't want to live life like this anymore. I am wondering if quitting smoking has helped you in the long run with anxiety and has it made you in general, a calmer person?

I am addicted to the hand to mouth motion more than nicotine

I smoked for 6 yrs, quit and now vape but I'm trying to quit that too. When I'm driving or at home watching tv or something, I reach for it because the motion and the act of smoking comforts me- it's more about that than the nicotine. When the batteries are charging I crave food, probably for the hand to mouth motion. Does anyone else experience this, and how can I lessen the weird hand to mouth obsession? Thank you!

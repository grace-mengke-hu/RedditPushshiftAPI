a question about weed

2 weeks tobacco free, don't feel very healthy and plan to never go back. Got some discomfort in my lungs which I understand is a sign of lungs healing and not something to get paranoid about.

Here's my question:
Would smoking a joint (pot rolled in a skin, no tobacco) cause damage to my lungs that would retard the healing process?

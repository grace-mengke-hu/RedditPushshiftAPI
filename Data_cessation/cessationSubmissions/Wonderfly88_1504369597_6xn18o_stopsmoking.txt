Round 7?

Good day Reddit, 

With the help of this sub I quit for over a year around August 2014 - late 2015 which was a greatly productive time for me. However since then I've been quitting and quitting quitting repeatedly and recently it's been every 10 days which is a nasty self destructive cycle to be stuck in. I quit August 11th, 10 days later I was in a big city and felt compelled to buy a pack. I quit in July and 10 days later I was in a city for a concert and as soon as I got off the train I "needed" to buy a pack. Before that I quit November to March when on vacation I had a few in the smokers pit and continued once I got home which was ridiculous as I worked at a scent free facility which meant no smoke breaks and I could have 1 way before work if I brushed my teeth, cleaned hands, and was in a hoodie etc. Sometimes I think I'm meant to smoke as my parents and grandparents were all pack a day or more smokers and so in a way it's in my DNA and in another way I know that's ridiculous. 

Anyways I need to quit quitting and just stop Smoking. I'm moving to a country in October where very few people smoke and my accommodations are no smoking I guess
I'm writing here to be accountable this time. Finished my pack 9 hours ago before bed. Round 7 here we go.

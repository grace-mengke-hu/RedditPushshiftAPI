Switched to 0 mg nictone vaping to help ease the transition - when to stop vaping?

So a little over a month ago I quit ciggarettes and switched to 0 mg nicotine vaping so that I could get nicotine out of my system and at least "feel" like I was smoking. It helped with the oral fixation and cravings. But I don't want to be vaping for forever, or even much longer. The idea was to become completely free from everything. How much longer you guys think I should use the vape for till I give it all up? At this point the nicotine is out of my system.

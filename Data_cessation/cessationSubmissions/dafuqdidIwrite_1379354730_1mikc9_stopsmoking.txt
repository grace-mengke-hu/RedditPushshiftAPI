2 Days... It's a lot for a chain smoker like me! `

Let's see for how long I make it this time...

Day 3 - Tough. Faced some breathlessness and uneasiness in the afternoon. But managed to avoid by having some extra coffee... I remember last time I tried (Jan 2013) the 3rd day was tough. This time it was easier. Survive another day to keep the fight on for tomorrow...

Woke up panicking and feeling ashamed

I woke up searching for the pack of cigarettes that I bought in a weak moment.

And then I realized it was all a dream.  OMG, that dream was so real. In the dream I was sitting in front of my laptop and the next thing I knew I had a pack of cigarettes in my hand and on going in my hand.  When I woke up I went searching beside my laptop, at this point a bit disorientated, looking for the pack of smokes so that I could dose them in water and start over.  It was when I looked at my laptop and noticed that the lid was still closed as I had left it when I went to bed, that it was all a dream.  On day #3 and still going strong. :)

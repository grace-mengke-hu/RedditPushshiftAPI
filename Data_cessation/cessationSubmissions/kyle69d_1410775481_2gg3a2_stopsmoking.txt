Never felt more sick.

So I'm on day 5 of quitting after smoking about half a pack a day, and I am in so much pain that I woke up and can't go back to bed. My throat hurts too bad to swallow water, my nose is stuffed, my ears really hurt, and most of my joints hurt too, especially my neck. Anyone else experience this? A few Google sites say a sore throat is a side effect but I'm in so much pain that even talking hurts

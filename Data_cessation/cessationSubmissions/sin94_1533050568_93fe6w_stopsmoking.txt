Thanks to this sub I am ONE YEAR FREE!!

This badge might not mean much, but I have being an active member of this sub for over 6 years with multiple attempts in the past. 

Non smokers will not understand nor be in a position to understand how craving affect an individual and the first 2 weeks I was constantly looking advice and only the encouragement received from this sub was what kept me going.  

Allen Carr book was the most important book I have read, although dry and tough to read (took me a whole month with reinforcement with the audio book). 

Those who are browsing this sub and still smoking trust me I have being a Redditor for over 10 years and a member of this sub for over 5 years, you have nothing to lose giving up smoking and everything to gain. 

Thanks Again for this help from this sub, you folks rock!!!

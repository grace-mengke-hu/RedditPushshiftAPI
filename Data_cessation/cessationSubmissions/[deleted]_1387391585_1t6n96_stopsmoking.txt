One Week! Is what's happening to me normal?

Hey guys, I've been a smoker for two years, casually smoking a pack a day for the last year.

I quit a week ago, and I don't know if what's happening to me is normal or not. I figure you guys would know best, so here goes:

1) The night of Day2, I had what I'd call... a smoking dream. In the dream I was under extreme stress, and my friend forced me to have a smoke even though I had told him that I was quitting, (this has happened in real life before, he usually thinks I'm just joking when I say I want to quit), and the taste of the cig was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. Then I woke up. But after I woke up, even though I dreamed the cigarette was the most disgusting thing ever, I was craving a smoke. I guess because I usually have a morning smoke?

2) Yesterday, Day6, I had the worst cold of my life. Lightheaded, shakey, hot/cold, stomach ache, muscle pains all over, and sore throat. I've never been this sick before, even when I smoked. I thought quitting smoking was supposed to make colds a breeze to get over?

Anyways, I quit completely, no cutting back, and I think I'm doing alright. All the things I associate with smoking I have tried to stop doing- drinking, drinking coffee, hanging out on my balcony, etc.

Plus, the feeling of being so sick that I want to cough my lungs up is making me wonder how I ever smoked when I was sick before.

Here's to another week at a time!

adverse effects after quitting smoking

hey guys so i kind of recently stopped smoking about 3-4 months ago idk exact date i quit smoking with the use of an e cig or a vape whatever u wanna call it i was a pack a day smoker so i gradually weened myself off nicotine and then when i got down to 3mg of nicotine i just quit the vape all together i felt pretty good a few cravings here and there but nothing a little will power cant resist, anyways its been about over a month since i quit nicotine all together and my anxiety is progressively getting worse! i thought it would go away within a few weeks after i quit but its getting worse everyday (i used to have really bad anxiety before starting smoking) im just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this, because i thought i beat my anxiety but now its back worse than ever.

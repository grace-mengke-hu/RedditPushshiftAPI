Could use some advice

I stopped smoking cold turkey roughly two months ago.  Occassionally I will get passing cravings but for the most part I can hold it together pretty well.

Today is the first day where I had to deal with massive stress since then.  My once comfortable, low stress job has basically just been flipped on its head and I'm genuinely terrified about what my future is going to be like now.  So, I really want to smoke.  I went outside and some coworkers were smoking, but honestly the smell deterred me from wanting to smoke, so thank god for that.  However I'm still really on edge and have no idea what I can do to take the edge off.  I was wondering what are some good things to do, or healthy/semi-healthy things I can do to help in place of smoking.  Thank you in advance.

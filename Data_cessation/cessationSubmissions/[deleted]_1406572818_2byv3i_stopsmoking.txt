Caved. But not discouraged.

Bit of a lurker here.  Just reset my badge from 148 days to 1.  But I'm not upset that I caved or that I smoked a cig.  What's done is done and that one smoke didn't kill me.  To be honest, I don't even think of it as caving in, more like I just made an allowance.  I certainly don't feel like I have failed, or like I want to resume smoking where I originally left off.

I don't feel any different at all.  The worst part is just having to reset my badge :(

My policy for resetting one's badge is pretty loose.  But in this case, I consciously decided to suddenly stop and buy a pack, so there's no denying it.

Anyway my point is that you should not be too hard on yourself about smoking or quitting.  Adding additional pressure and stress to yourself doesn't make it easier, it makes it harder, and more painful.  It doesn't have to be hard, and it should not be a struggle or a battle like most people say it is...  it's more relaxed than that.  More cerebral.

I had quit...

I was done, about two weeks. Then I came home for a week long visit and with all the stress of trying to help my mom, I’ve been smoking. I hate it, my husband hates it, my mom hates it. I know I’ll be fine once we’re on the road back home tomorrow, but while I’m here....holy shit. Anyone else struggle with smoking in one particular place? I’ve made it thru days at work, I’ve made it thru weekends, I’ve made it thru other stresses, but coming home just “triggers” me, for lack of better words. I’ve smoked for 23 years and am tired of it, I just suck at not smoking when around my mom and extended family. Just put my last one out before heading to bed...10:24 on 7/24. This one will  stick. I will quit.

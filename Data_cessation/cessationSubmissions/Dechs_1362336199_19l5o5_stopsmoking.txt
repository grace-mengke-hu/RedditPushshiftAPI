I want to quit, but I'm having trouble with my head.

I've smoked for seven years, I've tried quitting before. Four years ago I managed a week, last year a whole month. And it tasted like shit when I started smoking again and I felt like a jackass. The quitting wasn't even difficult, I hardly even felt nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Which should be promising for re-quitting, I suppose. 

My problems aren't with the physical symptoms, it's with the mental side of things. For the past year I've been saying to myself "I need to quit" over and over again.

Thing is, there are some things I like about smoking. It's sort of social, you get to meet new people in the smoking room in bars and such. And you have a reason for taking a break at work. I realise listing things like these makes me sound like an addict in denial. And the more I think about it, the crappier those reasons are. I can't really name anything in my life that was better or happier because I smoked.

I do hate my wheezing breathing, feeling out of air, coughing, dry nostrils, mucus, having to think about when I need to buy a new pack, sore throat, bad stamina, and all that you probably know too well. Hobos coming to bum cigarettes when they see you smoking. Looks of disapproval from mothers and fathers.

Smoking is a disgusting habit. And as someone who prides himself with rationalism, every time I smoke I feel stupid. It's an expensive product whose only function is keeping you hooked and making you feel extremely shitty. I have to admire the business idea, though. A completely useless product whose sole purpose is to make you buy more of it.

Anyway. I just sort of wanted to pour my heart out here. Any words of wisdom are much appreciated. I realise I probably haven't said anything that hasn't been said before, but.. It helps writing about things to other people, you know?

PS. Holy shit, this turned out long. Sorry.

4 months in

Man, it hasn't been easy. December was one of the hardest months in my life - my dear mother passed away - so I very nearly gave in. I actually had a puff in my lowest moment but immediately afterwards threw it away. (In my opinion it doesn't warrant resetting the counter, smoking a full one would)

One puff, no big deal? Well, it did change something psychologically. I'm now starting to feel nostalgic on smoking. I have dreamed of smoking (and would feel ecstatic about it), I have been nostalgizing on
 the mornings I supposedly was "enjoying" having the morning cig, sitting in the balcony. Rationally, I KNOW it was not that enjoyable, freezing my ass off there and getting nothing but difficulty in breathing and stinking clothes in return. It goes to prove the nicotine monster is still there in my mind and it doesn't take much for it to take control.

When I quit for 3 years back in 2008, I think it was pretty much smooth sailing at this point. Life was simpler and less stressful back then. Oh well, I will definitely keep on battling.

See you again in a few months. Stay strong, fellow quitters.

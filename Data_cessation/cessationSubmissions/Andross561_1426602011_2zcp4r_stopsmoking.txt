Double digits baby!

Today is my 10th day without a cigarette. I just want to thank everyone in this sub for your support. It really has helped a ton. I know 10 days isn't a lot but I feel great! Yesterday was the first day I felt comfortable enough to hang out with a smoker friend all day, and I didn't feel the need to have a single one! The future is looking bright! Thanks again everyone

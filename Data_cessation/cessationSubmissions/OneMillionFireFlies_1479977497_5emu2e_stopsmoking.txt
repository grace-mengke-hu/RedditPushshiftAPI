EBSS: Evil Bipolar Smoking Syndrome

Basically very simple: When I smoke, I feel crappy about myself & hate myself for it. I can think of 100 reasons why I should quit.

And now when I actually quit (into 10th day), can't seem to recall a single one of those 100 reasons, & desperate to pick up a cigarette. Why the hell did I stop?!

Cigarette, you are an evil jock concubine

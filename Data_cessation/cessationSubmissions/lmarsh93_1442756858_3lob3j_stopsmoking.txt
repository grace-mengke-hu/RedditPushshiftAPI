I'm fucking done

I've been smoking for 4 years now. I can't do it anymore. For the first time today I woke up hacking, I never thought I would reach that point. After years of waking up to my dad doing the same, how could I do that to myself? I want to be able to run again, I want to be able to climb a flight of stairs without getting winded, and god damn it I want to live as long as I can. 

I just want to thank this sub for existing, from what I gather you all are wonderful and supportive. 

Cheers to day 1.

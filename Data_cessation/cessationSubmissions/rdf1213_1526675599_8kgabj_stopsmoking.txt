I have no where else to go

Hey everyone, first time posting here. I've been a smoker for 4 years, cycling between a pack a day, to vaping 24/7, to nicotine gum, to nicotine inhalers, and to patches. I've also tried a variety of supplement combos. I've always tried to go at it alone, with no support. I'm 21 and living at home as a full time student. Both my mom and brother are heavy smokers, so I cannot ask for support from them. None of my friends are addicted (social smokers).

 I don't know where to go. If you guys can share with me what has worked for you, I'd really appreciate it. My mind is playing tricks on me and I need to know that I'm not alone...

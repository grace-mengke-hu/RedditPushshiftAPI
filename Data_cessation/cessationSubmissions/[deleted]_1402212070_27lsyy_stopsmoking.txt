Day 5 is the hardest yet?

I have tried quitting multiple times and the first few times I got the whole '3 day hump' thing and then just couldn't take the mental cravings. But the past few quit attempts I notice basically no cravings or symptoms until around day 3 and this time noticed literally nothing as far as mental or physical symptoms until randomly today on day 5 I woke up with a bad headaches like I used to have the first day after quiting and have been experiencing old triggers and cravings. It has been quite surreal because up until this point it seemed like it was gonna be pretty smooth sailing and I'd be over it.

Has anyone else had something like this or noticing symptoms getting worse instead of better as time goes on? It seems against all the quitting stuff I read but it has been my experience the last few weeks of trying to quit.

Might be important to note that I have only smoked about a year and only got up to around 4-5 a day.

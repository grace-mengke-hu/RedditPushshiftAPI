It'll Be A Month On Friday

I am still experiencing so many issues. I smoked for 20+ years, really never quitting before. The first week went pretty well, cravings out of habit mostly. Since then, I have been having terrible, really vivid dreams/nightmares. I have been vaping, and while it does satisfy the need, oh my gosh my sinuses. Headaches, nosebleeds, overall sinus pressure. I can only sleep at about 3 hours a clip. 

I want to say that I quit at a shitty time. I completely uprooted my life a few months ago, but I really want this. I love not smelling like cigarettes. I love not coughing lung butter up. And frankly, I'm fucking proud of myself. My boyfriend has seen how hard I'm struggling and even suggested I start smoking until I'm more settled. I'm not doing that. I know there is a likelihood I will smoke again, but I'm going to try my damnest. 

Has anyone else had these terrible sinus and nightmare issues?

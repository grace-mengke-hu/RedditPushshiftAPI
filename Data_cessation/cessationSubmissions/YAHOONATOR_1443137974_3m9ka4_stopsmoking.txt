My short story on how I decided to quit

This summer, I began to socialize more with my classmates, and kept attending massive parties. On said parties, there was always alcohol, which I don't have any problem with. On the first few, there was marijuana. I admit, I've been smoking since I was 15; both marijuana and regular cigs.

My lungs had gotten used to have smoke in them at every social gathering. Be it tobacco, vapor or cannabis smoke. I began smoking quite heavily during summer; sometimes I would even burn through a whole pack in less than 8 hours. 

Comes the school year 'round, and I decide to slow down the smoking to max 4 cigs in the morning, 3 in the afternoon and one in the evening. The plan worked; I was indeed noticing the change (and so was my wallet).

What comes next is more of a series of sudden revelations. Subliminally pointing out how bad I fucked up by even starting to smoke anything with nicotine in it. First, one of my best friends notices that I smell heavily. Embarassed, I tell him he's imagining things. But it was true; I did smell, and it felt REALLY bad to lie to him like that. Then, I told my ex-girlfriend that I started to slow down my smoking. She was deeply disappointed, way more than usual, though. She threatened to cut all contact with me if I went through one more pack.

Anyone would just think that since she's an ex, I wouldn't have to care about her stance. True; I don't have to, but I did. And I am honestly scared of getting on bad terms with her again; she's one of the nicest people I've ever gotten along with, even during our breakup. To put it simply, she gave me the first serious reason to quit. 

I took the last pack I had, mashed all the cigs and put them in the rubbish bin. I still use a vaporizer, but without nicotine.

Thanks, Isabel. 2 days clean.

TL;DR smoked heavily in summer, slowed down my smoking once school started, and my ex-girlfriend motivated me to actually quit.

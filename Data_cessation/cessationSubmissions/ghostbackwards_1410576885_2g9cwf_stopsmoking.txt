Tonight I watched some footage of me from a xmas party a couple years back. This is the first time I have watched myself smoke since I quit almost a year ago. Wow, that was crazy.

I have been having smoking dreams in the past week or so. One so vivid that I recall telling people in my dream that I just gave up 11 months. I recall saying it was gross and not finishing it. I didn't even finish it in my dream. 

I am on the wagon so I think that's why my dreams have been so much more vivid. 

You guys get these dreams even almost a year into no cigarettes?

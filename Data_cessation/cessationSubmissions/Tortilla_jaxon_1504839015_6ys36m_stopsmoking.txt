Deep breathing through a beast of a craving

I'm doing everything in my power to ride out this craving. Goodness I hate this. I really don't want to smoke but when these cravings hit, it's so tempting to "just smoke one." But that's all addiction is, one cigarette at a time. I will not give it power over my life anymore! I really enjoy deep breathing. It calms my mind when the craving is screaming for just one more puff. I'm just mentally exhausted from fighting them off though. Random thoughts. But I figured that posting here was much better than going and buying a pack.

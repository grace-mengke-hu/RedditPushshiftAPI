Quit cold turkey, but I had to give up drinking..

I quit last Thursday after 5 years of smoking. I knew it would be difficult and honestly I didn't really want to quit. Several people on this subreddit talked about how much energy they had and I had been feeling like shit for sometime. So I thought hey, maybe quitting would give me some more energy. It did, alot. I feel much better, but I had to give up drinking as well. I had a beer the other day and it took all the will power I had not to go and buy a pack. 

I am not sure if I will ever be able to drink again with out having cravings, but I certainly hope so. Maybe if some of you are having trouble like me than giving up the drink temporarily is the way to go. Let me know what you think.

what is your way to resist cravings?

 I guess tomorrow will be a difficult day as nicotine is almost gone from my system (app says so).  Great but I suppose cravings will be much more intense.. 

When the idea to smoke comes I think that I'm a non smoker now and don't smoke.  I visualise myself offering me a cigarette and I refuse to take it. This trick has helped me a lot because the idea of smoking stops before it rules my mind and drives me crazy. 

Until now it's ok.. What else can I do when cravings strike harder?

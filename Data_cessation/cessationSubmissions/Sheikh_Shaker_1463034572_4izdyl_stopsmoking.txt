89 Hours in.. having problems sleeping..

Hello,

I'll be 96 hours smoke free in 7 hours.. First two days i had to deal with hard cravings which i managed to pass by with an aggressive attitude;(FUCK YOU I AINT YOUR SLAVE, I CAN DO DIS!!, etc) yeah my way may seem strange to you, but bringing anger to this has helped me alot.

Anyways, the night before yesterday I've been having trouble sleeping when i was very tired and sleepy, and also yesterday..

anyone had the same problem? and if so what did you do to counter this..

P.S. This subreddit is the reason for this 89 hours achievement so far, so thank you very much, this is my first post and i really appreciate this subreddit.

5 Days!

Hey everyone! These posts are fantastic and really pushing me to continue to be smoke-free. I'm only on day 5 but I've had no cravings (possibly due to my nicotine replacement therapy, a Von Erl E-Cig), and even the slightest though of smoking a cigarette makes me want to throw up. I was with a huge group last night and everyone was smoking cigarettes. I was one of the youngest & biggest cigarettes smokers in this group, nobody saw this coming & so many people asked me for a cigarette last night or if I wanted a drag. It's only been 5 days, but it has also been 6 years. I'm looking forward to restoring so much in myself health wise, especially since I'm only 19 years old.

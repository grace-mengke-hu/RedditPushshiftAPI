First Week

Long time lurker from a different account. 

12 years of smoking at least pack a day. I tried to quit multiple times but never lasted more than a couple of days. 

It has been 5 days since my last cigarette. The major details difference being this community. I have been reading old posts and comments incessantly to keep me motivated. Big thank you to you all

A trick i saw on Youtube that might help new quitters.

Was searching for quit smoking videos i could listen to while at work, came across this "hypnotist" or whatever, didn't seem hopeful but his method was actually pretty intresting. Smoking is pretty much unconcious he said, by smoking a ciggarette consiously, you give yourself a real chance to decide wheter you wanna quit or not. And not completely give in to the addiction part. He told the smoker to close his eyes and light the ciggarette, take a puff but not inhale. The hypnotist then told the smoker to really taste the "precius" smoke and think about what he actually did to himself. The smoker could not finish that ciggarette, he was ill. He, according to the video stayed smoke free. This is really smart, that instant nicotine buzz you get from inhaling so fast cloaks what you really are inhaling. Yes of course its really the nicotine we want but knowing this, is certainly a major boost trying to quit them. Just wanted to throw it out there, i tried the method and I couldnt finish that last smoke and I almost threw up, so we'll see how my quit goes, it worked a year ago, relapsed cause of devils lettuce. - s

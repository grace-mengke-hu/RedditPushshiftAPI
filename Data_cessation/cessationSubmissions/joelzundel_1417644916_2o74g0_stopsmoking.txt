After 50 proud days, it happened. My first faliure

So yeah. Recently I had to drop high school and I've been going through some not very good days. I know that it's a shitty excuse and smoking will make feel worse. I need help. Right now, I have smoked 3 cigs and I can't stop. I don't yet see the power and the motivation. What do I do now?

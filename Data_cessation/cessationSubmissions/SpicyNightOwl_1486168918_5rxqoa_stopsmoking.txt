Trying to quit

Hey all! Been smoking since I was 16 and I recently turned 18 and decided I want to quit. I've gone cold turkey for a few days but I always end up having one after a few days. My mom smokes so there's constantly temptation around. I'll be moving at the end of the month and I know it'll be much easier once I do because I won't want to spend money on them. Any advice for quitting now? I usually only have one or two but still I don't like that I'm still doing it. Been working out daily too. Thanks!

16 days - Been A While (Update)

So it's been a tough time the last few days, but I think I'm pushing through it. I can actually work a full shift at work without an urge to smoke now, which is awesome.

Driving is still an issue, so I have taken up something else. I listen to music and memorize the lyrics, or listen to a comedy station and try to remember the name of the comedian and trying to repeat the entire set (XM Radio).

It's working so far. But I am going to need something else. The comedy channel likes to repeat.

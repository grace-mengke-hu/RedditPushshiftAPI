I've been smoking 1-2 cigars a week for 5 years (I am 34 now). What negative side effects do I have that I don't realize?

For instance, has this been bad for my teeth or my lungs or my mouth or something? I'd like to think It's a pretty light hobby of mine but I just wondered if someone could educate me on what negative affects I might be experiencing that I can't detect at my current rate of consumption.

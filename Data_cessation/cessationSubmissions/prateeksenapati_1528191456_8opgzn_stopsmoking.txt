Need some help here. I have been smoke free for 5 days now which is the longest I have resisted in last couple of years. And I am feeling really confident of not smoking in normal circumstances as I have very minimal cravings.

But the one situation where I am not yet confident is when I go for a drink. I don't want to give in after being smoke free for longer time. But then I also want to enjoy a beer or two during the weekends. Please help me with ideas of how to resist smoke while drinking. Thanks!

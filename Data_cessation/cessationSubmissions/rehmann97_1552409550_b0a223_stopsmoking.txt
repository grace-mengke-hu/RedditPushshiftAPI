How I quit smoking

I started smoking when i was in grade 8. I started with 1 cigarette everyday, which then increased to 2 and then 3. I  was afraid that my family would find out that I smoke, so i never smoked when i was at home but only with one of my friend from school. After my high school I moved to Malaysia for my university, and I started smoking all the time. Increased it to a pack or more everyday. 
After a year and half I started feeling unhealthy and tired all the time. Nicotine addiction is bad and I couldn't sleep without smoking. But then I decided not to smoke, took responsibility and decreased it day by day. 
I would say if you make your health your first priority then quitting is not that difficult, try to decrease it and smoke only when it's very much needed. Your cravingS of smoking will drop, and as soon as you start feeling healthy again you will not smoke at all. Now I smoke every once in a while which doesn't make me crave for cigarette all the time. 

Thank you for letting me share this.

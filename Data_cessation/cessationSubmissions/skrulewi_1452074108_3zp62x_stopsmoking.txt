2 AM rambling thoughts, gratitude.

I'm having difficulty in other areas of my life... I'm not going to get into it now, but I was getting down on myself, and staying up late is something that I do. But in floating around Reddit, I realized that I have 645 days, and I don't even think about it anymore. I don't even think about the fact that I don't think about smoking when life is shitty. I don't even think to come back here and support others, as a way of expressing my gratitude. I can be so selfish sometimes.

This place really helped me get over the hump and put days together. Get over the first 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. 

I am very grateful to not be breathing cigarette smoke anymore. And so is my girlfriend!

Much love and take care any night owls out there.

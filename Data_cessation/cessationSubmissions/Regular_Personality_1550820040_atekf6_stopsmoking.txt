Disgusting habbit

( 22M ) Here in australia, smoking is EXPENSIVE !

Smoked since i was 16 and started smoking a pack a day at around age 20.. whole family smokes, heavily, all my friends smoke, smoke is everywhere.

I actually hate it so much and wish i never started, but i enjoy it so much and it really is relaxing, while I’m smoking i just want to stop, and when I’m not i want another, huge contradiction but im sure you all understand if your here.

I got on champix about 2 months ago, and it gave me ZERO side effects, i quit for 12 days and i couldn’t believe it, i saved what felt like a fortune too, so much disposable cash at the end of the week that i didn’t have before.

Unfortunately i thought i was strong enough not to get my next script filled, so i didnt, and i started again..

Any tips on how to get rid of this filthy habit, tried vaping, its rubbish

45 Days Strong...

Hey guys, thanks for posting. Reading these success stories is my main craving aversion. Since quitting, I feel at least 85% better. My tastebuds and sense of smell returned and, ironically, I feel less stressed.

When I do get a craving, I focus on keeping myself busy, text my SO about it and wait it out.

I'd like to say the cravings have gone away, but this morning I walked past a woman smoking and got an intense craving. I waited it out, but it wasn't easy.

Still, I'm glad to call myself a non-smoker! Thanks for y'all's support!

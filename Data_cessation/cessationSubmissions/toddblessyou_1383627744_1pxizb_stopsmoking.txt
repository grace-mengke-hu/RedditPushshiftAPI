An Honest 2 Months!!! Thank you guys!!

I am in total disbelief right now.  I started smoking as a touring musician that worked as a bartender in my in between time.  Smoking became a huge part of my daily routine.  It seemed impossible to even THINK about quitting.  That was before I started trolling this sub reddit.  Thank you guys for the motivation and support.  I'm all done now and NEVER looking back.  You know how good it feels to say that with total confidence?  Yeah, you guys do.

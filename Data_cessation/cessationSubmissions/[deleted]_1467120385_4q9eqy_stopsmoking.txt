Psychiatrist's PA prescribed my mom Chantix

If this isn't the right sub, please direct me to one that is better. I am just wanting to gain understanding on the drug and on who is authorized to prescribe it.

This was many years ago, but like many things, I'm still losing sleep trying to figure it out. Do physicians get compensated for prescribing certain drugs? I just can't for the life of me figure out why a psychiatrist would prescribe chantix to my mother.

My mom was in psychiatry for ongoing treatment for bipolar II disorder. She mentioned at one point that she wanted to stop smoking, the PA gave her chantix. 

This set her off on one of the worst manic episodes I've ever seen. She did not fully recover for another 4 years, cycling in-between mania and extreme depression during that time (last year or so was depression). 

I was left in charge of her, as an 18 year old, as the rest of the family was 'done.' When I visited the PA with her, she said to my mom "Well remember honey, I told you that there could be some side affects but you still agreed to take it." My mom didn't really register what she was saying as she was full blown manic at this time.

My mom is much better now, although she still smokes. my family has come down to the thought process that it's better she smokes than 'go crazy.' 

I'd like insight on similar experiences. If you need to redirect me to another sub that is fine as well.

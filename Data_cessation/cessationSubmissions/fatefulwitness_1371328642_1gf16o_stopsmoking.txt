My wife and I, almost through the full second day. Any ex menthol smokers?


Today is the second full day for my wife and I. I'm using 1/2 dose of chantix 2x a day, since I got a bit wierd last time. My wife is on a full one. Not fun to quit together, but is there any other way?

I noticed already, my teeth are whiter, and my gums tighter. I'm actually looking forward to my next cleaning. This is actually a major reason this time. My teeth and gums aren't the best, and I'm getting older. I know I'll lose a couple soon if I don't quit. I smoked 42 years. Only really quit twice-  7 months, and another 1.2 years, in the past ten.

We both dreamed of smoking last night.

I seem to have less cravings now, but I just realized, that last time I was quitting menthols. What helped then? I put a bit of Vick's vapo rub in a small vial Imkept in my pocket. When I got a craving, I used to snort some fumes. It worked, and I used it for at least a couple weeks.

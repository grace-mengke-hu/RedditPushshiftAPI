Day 3 AKA Another Testament to Carr

A few days ago, I came to this subreddit for support because I had made the sudden decision to quit smoking for my 4th time. After some kind people came by to lend some words, the one that stuck with me the most was a conversation about Allen Carr's book that you've certainly heard of if you've visited this sub before. I ended up reading the entire book that night and it was quite possibly one of the best decisions I've ever made. 

I'm making this post for two reasons. 1.) I'm here to say that if you've tried quitting before or maybe you just feel quitting would be more of a burden than an asset or even just want to try something different when it comes to quitting, you should absolutely try reading his book Easy Way. It doesn't convince you to quit, it doesn't just list facts and numbers and all that fun stuff, it completely will change your perspective. You just have to be ready to open your mind and really soak in the entire book. Day by day the difference is priceless. 2.) I've gone three days now and I feel incredible. I truly haven't had any cravings, the thought of a smoke is just disgusting to me. I don't doubt I'll have a craving at some point in the near future, but at the moment, I might as well have never smoked before. I can't wait to see how the rest of this experience goes, I know I'll definitely be checking in here along the way and so should you because this community is wonderful!

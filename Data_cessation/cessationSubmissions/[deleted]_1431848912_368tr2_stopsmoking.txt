About to give it another try.

Dear /r/stopsmoking,
I have tried to quit over the last years a couple of times. every time that I smoke the last fag of a box I try say to myself that it was my last, never worked. Two times I have quit for about 4 weeks and one time for about 2 weeks. Now I want to give it again a serious try. My motivation is mainly my financial situation that is about to get even worse soon. The money I spent for fags, I have to cut from my plate for  a while already which is obviously a really idiotic act.
Another reason to quit is that I always felt ashamed that I smoked towards people I care about. I started to smoke shortly before I moved far away from my family to study at the university of my choice. After smoking for years they still do not have a clue about it and it feels like I am wearing a mask hiding part of myself from my family.
So, now is the time to finally stop! wish me luck.

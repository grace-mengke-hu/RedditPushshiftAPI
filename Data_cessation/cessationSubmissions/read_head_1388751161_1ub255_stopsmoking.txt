Well damn, guess I really am quitting!

Pack-a-day smoker here for about 26-27 years. I have had many very good reasons to quit over the years, and have even made a few valiant attempts. One attempt lasted for about six months, and that felt fantastic! So with a new year approaching, I had vowed to once again give them up. This time for good. Deep down inside I had felt that it would be an empty promise to my family once again, and that their tears would fog up the inside of the window as they watched me cave after a few days.

But life (or fate, god, the universe, or whatever) threw me a little curve ball this time! On the 30th of December, one of my back teeth cracked clean in half while I was chewing a tough piece of meat. The dentist couldn't even make a crown post out of it, and had to just pull it. He gave me very strict instructions to not smoke until the extraction site healed, if I could at all resist it.

Well, I guess resolution day has come a little early. So I slap on my patch and get down to the business of quitting. About halfway through the second day, that old craving is nagging at the back of my mind and I sneak out for just a couple of quick puffs. Wrong! After a few drags off of my cigarette, I swear my face turned green just like in the cartoons and I hurled violently! Since then I have tried the experiment a couple more times with the same results. So, I have learned that if I smoke at all with a patch on, I will puke. Great...just great.

Now I'm starting to feel queasy if I even think about stepping out for a smoke. Damn. I guess I really am quitting.

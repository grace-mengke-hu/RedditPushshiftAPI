Today's the day

It's time reddit, really hoping to find a bit of support on here to help me crack through. Gone from 20 a day down to about 6 or 7 in the past three months, think i'm ready to make the leap of faith. Just had my last outside after writing this before posting.

It is finished

 WISH ME LUCK GENTLEMEN.

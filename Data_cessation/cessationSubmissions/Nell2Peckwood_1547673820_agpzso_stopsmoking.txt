19 Days In and my cravings have been so bad today!

There have been so many “I should go for a cigarette, I’m too stressed to deal with this” moments today. I haven’t caved and I don’t intend to, I know how upset I’d feel with myself and so to get through those moments all I could do was close my eyes and inhale deeply. I’m sure my colleagues thought o was going insane. 

I’m new here sorry for the vent. Any support greatly appreciated, genuinely.

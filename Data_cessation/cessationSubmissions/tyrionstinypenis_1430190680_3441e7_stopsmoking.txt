Hey r/stopsmoking-ers I need to make a confession.

I've quit analog cigs for 14 weeks and 3 days. And they have been the best few weeks of my life. During this time I haven't had a single puff. Not a single fucking puff whatsoever. 
But today, I felt particularly stressed about my finals and a huge-ass research paper I have to write. So I caved in and bought an e-cig with 17-24 mg rating. 

I'm not asking for sympathy, I know I cheated on myself. I'm just trying to get my feelings out of my chest. I feel like if I bought an ecig in private and puffed it would somehow lessen the crime. Confessions are good for the soul they say. So yes stopsmokers I caved in and started smoking ecigs. 

I confess, that I started smoking again and I need to retake this whole thing back after this week is over and I'm done with finals. There. Thanks bye

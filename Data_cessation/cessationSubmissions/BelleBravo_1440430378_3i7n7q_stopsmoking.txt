3 Cigarettes, 2 People, and a being ill

and through it all I still did not smoke one cigarette. I got a bit sick on Thursday but was able to sleep through it and get over the sickness or whatever it was in a day, a co-worker asked me to join him for a smoke, I went outside with him told him I quit and he refused to let me even hold a cigarette. A friend came over to enjoy some time with me in the pool, smoked two cigarettes in front of me and as much as my brain was screaming at me to ask for one and tried to ration me to ask for a drag I resisted temptation and rewarded myself with chocolate cake. 

It feels nice to resist temptation. Im proud of myself. Just wanted to share hope you all don't mind.

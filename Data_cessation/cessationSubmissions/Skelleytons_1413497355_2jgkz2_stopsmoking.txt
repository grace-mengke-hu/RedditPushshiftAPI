You guys helped me with quitting, so here's my story! 25 days quit after an over 6 year habit.

Hello! Everyone's stories and struggles have been such a help to me, and I hope what I went through can help someone as well.

I actually used to be a staunch anti smoker for years, up until I was 21 and drinking with a friend. I was stressing out about a bad relationship, I was drunk, he gave me my first cigarette.... And next thing I know, I've got a full blown habit. I smoked an average of a half a pack to almost an entire pack a day. I absolutely loved smoking. I'm also a bit neurotic and smoking was largely an emotional crutch as well.

I quit on a whim when my long term (also smoking) boyfriend announced with no planning that he was going to quit. I had been thinking about it for awhile and thought it was as good a time as any, so that's how it started. I've tried to quit a couple times over the years, but was obviously unsuccessful and wouldn't last more than a day.

The first week was one of the worst of my life. Especially day 2. There was a lot of crying. I felt like I was grieving the loss of a good friend. 

After the crying and anger spells subsided (only took 6 days!), i started to feel things and experience life in a totally different way. Food tasted better, breathing was no longer difficult, my skin looked years younger, I felt more at peace with myself.

Since quitting, I have taken up running, something that I told myself that I would never be able to do. My boyfriend and I are much more active, walking about 10 miles every Sunday and going to the gym daily. Our new addiction is exercise, and we are already seeing positive changes.

After succeeding in the difficult task of quitting, I feel like I can do anything. I have never felt more happy or confident in my life, which is a pretty new feeling for me.

Hang in there, new quitters. For me personally, cravings are no longer existent. I can't even picture myself smoking. It is so worth it!!

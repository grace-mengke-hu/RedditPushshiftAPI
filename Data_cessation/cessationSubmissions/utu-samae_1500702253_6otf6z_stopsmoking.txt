I'm broke with 3 cigarettes left. I'm forced to quit.

I feel like a scumbag addict for even asking this, but does anyone here have experience with this? How can I make sure I don't spend the money I need for groceries until the end of the month on cigarettes. I need to quit. Not just for the financial aspect, but this past month I've really begun to loathe myself for my addiction. 

Any advice would be hugely appreciated!

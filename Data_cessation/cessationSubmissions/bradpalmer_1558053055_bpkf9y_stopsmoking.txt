965 Days and I still could smoke if I let myself.

965 days since ive had a smoke, crazy how easy it would be to let myself have one , I know now that I never actually would because im too proud but I always have that little voice in the back of my head saying have a smoke go on do it and I honestly dont think that voice will ever go away, I just know that I have to do my best to block it out and continue my smoke free journey. I guess what im getting at is once you are addicted to something, its pretty much a life sentence, but at the end of the day you have the power within to escape it, even if its going to be a constant effort.

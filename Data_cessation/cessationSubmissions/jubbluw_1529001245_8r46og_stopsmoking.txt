Was on gum. Then tried Allen Carr...

On my second quit attempt. I was on gum. Then I went out to the library and borrowed Allen Carr's book on a whim. Went out to get smokes just to challenge the book. Smoked as I read. Didn't want to smoke anymore after I finished the book. It's bloody disgusting and it tastes and smells so bad. Threw the rest of the pack away( painful because it's bloody expensive where I live) I'm keeping the gum tho. Promised my girlfriend who I on a temporary break from that I will come back better and stronger. Looks like I will checking one thing off the list EASILY.

Will my skin ever get better?

After many failed attempts and week on/week offs, I'm back in the game and two days cigarette free. I know now that I can't be a 'social smoker' but I'm trying to imagine my life months from now smoke free. 

My biggest fear is my teeth and my gums, but I'm also getting more and more concerned with my appearance in general. I'm in my early thirties and have quite set frown lines, is it wishful thinking to think that their appearance might get better the longer I don't smoke or am I just in damage control now?

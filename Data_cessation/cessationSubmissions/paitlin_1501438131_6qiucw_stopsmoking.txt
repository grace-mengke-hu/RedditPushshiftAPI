It's day 5 for me now

Beyond having saved ~$25 already and forgoing **100** cigarettes, I experienced my first notable benefit today.  
    
I definitely don't have the nicest skin in the world. It's abhorrently dry (which isn't helped by the fact that I live in Colorado), I have texture problems, black heads, and I wouldn't say acne, but I definitely consistently get breakouts. I did my skincare this morning, and for the first time in god-knows-when, my skin still feels moisturized hours and hours later. This feeling doesn't usually last very long on a daily basis, so I'm very excited. I also look like I'm more naturally glowy - I didn't realize how dull my skin looked until now. And this is only day five! I'm hoping maybe the various types of blemishes I have start to work themselves out next, as my skincare routine will be more effective without having to fight against unnecessary toxins.  
   
So yeah! Just thought I'd share. I'm so happy with this process so far, and I'm excited to experience the plethora of other changes as they come.

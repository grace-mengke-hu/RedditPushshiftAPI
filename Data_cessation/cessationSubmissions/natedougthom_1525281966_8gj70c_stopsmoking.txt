Back to Quitting

Been smoking since 2011. Started when I graduated College. I have had plenty of ups and downs, back and forth , on and off again trials with quitting. 

My biggest problem with smoking, is that I like it. For a lot of different reasons. 

However, after adding more stress to my life with a new job, I've been smoking more often at work. Now my chest hurts. 

I CANT KEEP DOING THIS. 

I am sure some of you feel the same way. I wanted to share my story, offer help, ask for advice, but in general have solidarity with you all. 

Thanks for reading.

Day one has been messy so far

Tomorrow was supposed to be my quit day but I ran out of smokes last night and couldn't justify buying another whole pack for one day. So I bought nicotine replacement patches instead and four different flavours of gum, and here I am. Today was messy until I got a patch on. I feel a bit better but very cranky and emotional. 

My boyfriend smokes nearly a pack a day so this will be hard. He's keen to support me though, by not smoking in front of me and washing his hands often and chewing gum and generally just making sure he doesn't smell like an ashtray. He's also a fantastic emotional support. 

I know I can do this, I just know it won't be pleasant. So hi, I'm Kat, and I guess I don't smoke anymore!

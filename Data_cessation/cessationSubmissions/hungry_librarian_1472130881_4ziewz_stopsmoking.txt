Winging it & quitting on a whim

My chest hurt when I woke up this morning, and I could hear that when I breathed deeply, something was rattling around in my lungs.  I smoked too much last night, and I thought about how nice it would be to never feel this way again.  So I just didn't light up this morning.  I would normally have had at least four or five cigarettes by now, throughout my morning routine and drive to work.  I still have the pack in my purse, and I could have one whenever I want to.  I've been tempted, especially in the car, but it's more because of force of habit than really wanting a cigarette.  So... we'll see what happens.  I'm not going to rip out the safety net yet, and I will probably be smoking again by the end of the day, but I wonder how long I can do this without giving in?  I'll keep you all updated, if you're interested.  

Did any of you quit this way, without planning a quit date?  Any advice, encouragement, etc. is welcome!

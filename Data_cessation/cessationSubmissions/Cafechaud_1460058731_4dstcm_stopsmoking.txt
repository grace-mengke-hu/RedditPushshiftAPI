Anyone slowing down hoping to make it zero a day?

I have been smoking one or two cigarettes a day.  I will wake up at 8am and usually will have a cigarette around 4pm. 
During that time I do not feel the need to smoke.
I feel like I am emotionally attached to smoking because the thought of quitting makes me feel uneasy? If that makes any sense. 

It just doesn't make any sense to buy a 12$ pack of cigarettes and smoke one a day.
Should I skip a day for a smoke and eventually just one a week...

Does cold turkey work well?


During the morning if I am out walking, and see someone smoke or smell it.. it grosses me out but by the end of the day I'm smoking one.

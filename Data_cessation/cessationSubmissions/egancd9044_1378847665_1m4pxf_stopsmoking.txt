I have the urge to eat EVERYTHING I see since I quit smoking...Advice?

I used to smoke a cigarette after every meal (like every other smoker on the planet).  It was like a post meal treat if you will.  Well now I find myself filling that void with ACTUAL treats and sometimes more food.  My cravings are becoming less and less, but I'm finding myself snacking more throughout the day as well.  I chew gum pretty much all day and I tried carrying grapes around with me everywhere to eat instead of junk.  Grapes worked okay, but I would like to get my normal appetite back, just without cigarettes...has anyone else experienced this and have any advice?

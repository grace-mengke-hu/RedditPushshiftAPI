One year, today

November 27, 2016 - my first day without cigarettes.

It was the money and the waiting that made me stop.

The (at the time) $300 a month that I was spending on cigarettes (now it's closer to $400).  

Worse, though, was the waiting - waiting for morning break to go out and smoke, waiting for meetings to end so I could go out and smoke, waiting for a moment in the conversation with friends when i could duck out between drinks and have a smoke - only to come back and discover I'd missed a whole story.  Waiting for a movie to end so i could go out and smoke - waiting for everything to end, just so i could smoke, rushing through everything just for a smoke.

I wasted so much time waiting to have a cigarette that I kind of boggles my mind - though I try not to think about it because it's too depressing.

You're not helping yourself or anyone you care about - or anyone who cares about you - by continuing to smoke.  I smoked for 30+ years, so i needed all the help i could get (including a warning from my doctor that I'd probably have a heart attack within 5-ish years if i didn't stop smoking) - but I did it, and today is my one year anniversay of doing the right thing.

it will likely suck balls for a while, but in the end, it's so, so worth it.

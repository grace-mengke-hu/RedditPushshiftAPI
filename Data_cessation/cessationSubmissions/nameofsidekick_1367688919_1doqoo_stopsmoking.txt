140 days without cigarettes, and I want to give back! Ask me any question you may have about quitting.

[Edit] Ack! The title should obviously say 120 days, not 140 (but that's coming up quick anyway!). I'm slightly sick, so excuse the mindlapse. 

I'm thinking weight gain/loss, when cravings stop, when those crazy dreams may stop, tactics I used to quit (began with e-cigarette, then stopped altogether, then read Allen Carr, and used NOPE method). Anything you can think of and I'll see if I can answer it. 

I know when I was quitting, this community helped me so much. It was great to look at the experiences of past smokers and see what I was in for!

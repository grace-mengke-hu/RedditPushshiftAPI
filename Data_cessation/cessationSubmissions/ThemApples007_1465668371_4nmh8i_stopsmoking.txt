Put myself to the test last night - success! 3 weeks in.

I haven't smoked in 3 weeks. It was challenging but fortunately not as challenging as I thought, until last night. I went out drinking with friends, it was a crazy night and really fun. Almost every moment someone was smoking near me. I even went out for "smoke breaks" but didn't smoke. I just like the socializing factor and getting some "actual" fresh air. I easily could have had a cigarette. After 3-4 beers I wanted one really bad, but I maintained and didn't do it. My friends are awesome - they're super supportive. That's important, if you have any friends trying to quit, be as supportive as possible and praise them for their good decision.

Normally on a night like this I would have smoked 6-8 cigarettes. But I just wouldn't allow myself to. All I can think about is:

1) I've come this far, do I really want to ruin that?
2) I'm one of the rare statistics that quit smoking cold turkey on the first try. This is how I'm giving the tobacco industry the finger. I'm stronger than they want me to be. I've already saved $100 in cigarettes. This will amount to $1,500+ for the year. Some tobacco reps bonus will be smaller this year because I broke free. 
3) If I don't quit now, then when?
4) Do I really want to invite those chest pains back? One grandfather died from a stroke, one from a heart attack, my grandmother died of 2 strokes and my dad already had heart surgery. The odds are already against my favor as I get older, let's not make it harder.
5) My productivity and energy has nearly doubled. That feels awesome.

To everyone considering quitting smoking - I'm nobody special and just an average "Joe". Don't think you have to have some crazy willpower to quit. You just have to decide and then stick with it. If you smoke again, then don't feel down, get back up and keep fighting. Surround yourself with support. Share your story.

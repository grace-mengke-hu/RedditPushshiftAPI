Soooooo Day 5 of quiting smoking

Soooooo after twenty odd years of being a smoker and a horrible dental experience meaning I had to suddenly have out 3 of my front teeth mainly at the front. I've been smoke free for 5 days now. When I look in the mirror I now see massive gaps in my teeth reminding me of the damage I've done to myself by smoking roll ups every day and smoking weed. I'm using a Nicorette inhalator to keep the cravings at bay. I now have to wait 3 months until I get a denture fitted. I'm taking quitting smoking one day at a time. I keep saying to myself "I'm still here", making myself do things, being sober and being busy. I keep thinking about January when I can get my teeth fixed. I keep thinking about the future, being sober, I'm now aware that I've wasted so much time being stoned out of my box. But now I can do stuff, change myself. I'm still here and I feel free.

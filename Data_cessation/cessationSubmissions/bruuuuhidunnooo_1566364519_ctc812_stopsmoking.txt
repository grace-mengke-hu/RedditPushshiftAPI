Nicotine toothpicks exist and they’re fucking incredible

22 years old now and started smoking cigarettes shortly before I turned 18. After a couple years I switched to vaping thinking it was healthier continued to smoke cigarettes often though. Ended up getting into the Juul which I thought was great at first but after a year I started having some serious throat issues (I have some alcohol abuse issues which could tie into the problems but it’s unclear) so I quit. I started out on the patch because the gum and lozenges just fucked up my mouth and hurt my throat. I was using dumdums to replace the hand to mouth action and it got me thinking “why aren’t there nicotine suckers?” After googling it I found out there was such a thing but it was dead as fast as it started because people were like “oh but the chiiiiildreeeen.” While searching that though I found nicotine toothpicks and ended up ordering a pack of them and boy oh boy are they fucking great. For me nicotine was favorite part about tobacco. More than anything I just love the nicotine buzz and these toothpicks are by far the best nicotine buzz I’ve ever had. If the drug that is nicotine is your favorite part of smoking then you will definitely like these. Also having something to fuck around with in your mouth and being able to use them anywhere is great. 

TLDR: nicotine toothpicks are the best nicotine delivery method I’ve ever tried and great for the oral fixation

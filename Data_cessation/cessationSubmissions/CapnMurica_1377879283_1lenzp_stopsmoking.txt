2nd longest break from smokes in 5 years...

Just made it to 1 week. I started smoking when I was 18, so 5 years ago. This week is the 2nd longest time I have gone without a cig since I started. The other time I was recovering from knee surgery. I went three weeks and didn't think anything of it. Then, as I was driving home from physical therapy, I decided to grab a pack, and the rest is history. I remember not even missing them when I bought that pack. Oops. Learn from your mistakes I guess.

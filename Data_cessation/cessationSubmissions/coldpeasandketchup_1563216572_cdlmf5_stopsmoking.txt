I'm going to do it!

So I've known for a long time that I need to stop smoking, I've just never really wanted to. I still don't hugely want to, but one of my managers told me today that her mum almost had to have her leg amputated because of smoking and it's really playing on my mind. Also I'm 22F if that matters. 

I'm going to Reading festival in August and I've decided that when I'm home, I'm stopping. It probably seems silly not stopping straight away but I know for a fact that being around my friends, drunk, and them smoking will be incredibly hard. It'd without a doubt either make my time there insanely difficult and/or put an end to any progress I'd made. 

Basically just wanted to say hi and see if anyone had any advice! I'm not sure whether to give up gradually or just go cold turkey - I know giving up entirely all in one go will be harder but I'm willing to struggle more for a shorter amount of time. 

Thanks in advance, and well done to all you guys who are well into giving up! I hope to be joining you soon :-)

I keep going back to day 0

I’ve started smoking on the regular in may 2017. I was stressed out because of exams, and decided I’d smoke pot here and there to help me  relax. But it just made me crave smoking more, so I stopped the weed but kept the cigarettes. I hate that I did that. 
I kept telling myself that I could stop whenever, and that it just helped with my stress. I lied to myself. 

I tried stopping over the summer. The longest I managed was 6 days. I tried to reduce the smoking by using alternatives such as snus, but I grew disgusted with the taste and stopped. 

Went on holidays where the price of a pack was the double of what I paid home, and thought that would stop me. It didn’t, I just paid the price. 

Right now, I’m getting sick, my throat is closing in on me, I’m in the middle of exams and really stressed out, but I need to stop, for my own good. 

I just don’t know how to fight the urge. What solutions there is for me to end the cravings. Do you guys have any tips ? Chewing gum just doesn’t cut it for me for instance. I get so irate when I haven’t smoked that it’s taking a toll on me and my relationship at times.

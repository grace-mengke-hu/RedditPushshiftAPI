Smokey air and sickness and I can actually still breathe

Hey All!

I have never posted here since successfully quitting. Today however changed everything. MY city is near a bunch of wildfires and I'm also dealing with sickness and seasonal allergies. Although its a bit of a struggle still, I made a really conscious note this morning about how if I still smoked I don't know how I'd be able to manage and breathe at all. I really appreciate this sub being here when I was having hard days because its all paid off. Just about to hit 10months smoke free and I couldn't be happier.

It's been almost one month 27days strong.

Ok so it's almost one month. 
Let me break down the changing of events from day one of quitting. 

- week one 
(set rules with so And had very mild craving once or twice)

-week two 
( the cough started and the mucus...and I am a nurse and I somehow got a bacterial pneumonia from a the hospital...I also tribute this to my lungs being weak and already starting the recovery cough from smoking) 

-week three-present 
( it's been hell, with my lungs anyway coughing wheezing  can't breathe  headache you know all the good pneumonia symptoms. I just finished a ten day regimen of antibiotics with oral steroids and an inhaler. I'm recovering nicely, my GF is still smoking but not as much bc I complain about her stinking and such.. But she still has not joined me in my endeavor. 
I have zero cravings now and now cigarette smoke bothers me so much it's so fowl smelling and makes me want to vomit.) 

Well with that said I wouldn't be here without this sub you guys/gals are great  and I wouldn't have even known where to start with support with quitting.

So once again thanks to you all now that I don't smell like ass my car and my house smell great and I'm saving money on top of that, but the most important thing is my health I think now my health and lungs will be much happier :)

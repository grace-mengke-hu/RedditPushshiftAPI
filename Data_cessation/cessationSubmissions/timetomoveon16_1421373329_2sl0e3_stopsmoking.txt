Today is 2 weeks and I think I have this.

I started smoking when I was 16 and was only going to smoke for the buzz.  Telling myself I can quit when I want and I an not addicted to smoking. 16 long 1 pack a day years and about a dozen half hearted attempts to quit smoking I finally realized smoking is an addiction.  

BUT, addictions can be beat, and I just finished 2 weeks being a non smoker.  This is my first post, but I wanted to thank all of you for helping me on my journey.  I have been reading posts on here and your comments and it has helped me many times not smoke.  While I still have cravings and think about it a lot I am much happier not smoking. I also know any time I may think about a relapse I can come here for support.

THANK YOU

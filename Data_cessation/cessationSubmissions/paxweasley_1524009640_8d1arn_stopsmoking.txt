I know it's the nicotine addiction talking, but I don't want to quit, I want to keep smoking because it's fun but I don't want to die. I do want to quit and I don't. Does this make sense?

My stream of consciousness right now goes like this:  I do want to quit.  I don't want to quit.  I want to stop smoking and never smoke another.  But what could *one more* hurt?  

I know the mantra not another puff no matter what but I want to take another puff... but I do not want to die young. 

What I really want is to smoke consequence free.  But god.  I want to smoke more.   Edit: This is quitting attempt like 5 idk.  I'm really good at quitting for a month at a time and not staying quit.  I wanna *stay* quit.  

Help!!  

Edit: oh my god I can't even stop looking at the cigarette in the subreddit logo.  It looks so nice.  I don't want to smoke.  Aaahh I'm losing it lmfao.

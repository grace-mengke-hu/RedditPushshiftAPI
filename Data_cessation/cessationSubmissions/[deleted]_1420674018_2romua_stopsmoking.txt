Tomorrow is day 5 - stayin' alive!

I've been pretty moody and full of angry outbursts at times.

However, I'm not really thinking about cigarettes that much anymore. I'm still not sure how I'm going to be able to drink -- my thought since I haven't had a drink in a couple of days is to just give that up too.

It doesn't really mesh with any of my current life goals anyway. That being said I've tried this and failed before so I'm debating on getting a sponsor or going into full recovery, attending meetings and other shit like that for the first time ever.

Nicotine and alcohol are such bitches.

So here is my problem: Please help.

i have sinus congestion/colds/smokersflu  that never go away. Worst feeling is every morning.
Back of my throat hurts and i have to sneeze 6 or more times unti my throat hurts and have to sneeze a lot randomly throughout the day.
Night time, always have the hardest time sleeping because i always have stuffy nose, can't breath.



Doctor alway give me allegra and nasal spray which worked fine.but i can only  use it for 3 days.
After i stop using the meds it will come back.

Thank you!

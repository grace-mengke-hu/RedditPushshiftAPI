Wellbutrin + quitting smoking side effects?

I've been taking welbutrin 300 mg slow release since March 10th. I've also smoked for 15 years, around a pack a day. The last cigarette I smoked was Wednesday night at 11PM. Last night and tonight, in the early evening, I've started experiencing strange feelings of dizzyness, tingling on my face and legs, and a general floaty, disconnected feeling. If you've ever taken hallucinogens, it feels like the beginning of the trip when it's kicking in.

I'm concerned and wondering if anyone has experienced this before under similar circumstances, and if this is normal, or something I should call the doctor about. 

Thanks in advance!

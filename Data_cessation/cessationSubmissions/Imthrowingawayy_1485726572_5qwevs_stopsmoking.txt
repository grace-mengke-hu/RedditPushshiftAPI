5 days in, realizing biggest trigger is my spouse. Any advice ?

Not sure if this is the right place to write but I'm looking for some advice. 
So I'm on day 5 after about a decade of smoking, I haven't gone this long in about 3 years. cold turkey seems to be working this time, and I'm extremely proud of myself. 
Work and alone time, I do fine ! I manage my cravings better than I would've imagined and I manage to stay calm. The problem is when both my spouse and I are home. Everything makes me irritated and have intense cravings
 I don't know how to make it better. Any advice ?

37 Days In...

After being a smoker for the last 18 years I took my last drag 37 days ago. 

I also signed up for a charity boxing programme 5 weeks ago. I'm happy to say after a rigorous 5 week cross fit/boxing boot camp, out of 24 girls, 4 were selected to participate, and I was one of them. I never in a thousand years thought my fitness would get back up to snuff. I am now 8 weeks away from my first amateur fight, and I feel awesome. 

Keep on keepin' on everyone. You're all doing awesome and it's only going to get better.

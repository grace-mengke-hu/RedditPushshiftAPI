Swimming did it for me....

So I've been a light smoker for decades, well, let's go 18 years back and I was a heavy smoker...

A few years back I decided I would never stop smoking but would try to smoke very little, and for the most part that worked for me.

Then four months ago I started taking swimming lessons, and man... I would stop in the middle of the pool, hold on to the lane rope and cough and rest for a couple of minutes.... Then I tried not smoking one day and the next class was a bit better, then I tried not smoking for a few days and felt some more improvement, now by this time I hadn't decided to quit smoking, but comes one day when I have a couple of cigarettes and the next class I could feel it....

So It's been 4 months since I started swimming and I've probably had about 4 cigarettes.... I was already smoking very little prior to my swimming classes, 1 to 3 cigarettes a day only on weekdays, so it wasn't that bad I guess...

The reason I'm sharing this is that I found a physical activity that I really enjoyed and that gave me that extra motivation... Something like this could maybe work for you.

For my father it was his older's brother emphysema that made him stop smoking cold turkey, and I'm glad I stopped because of something so positive...

When will I be able to talk to people again?

Hello.

1 pack a day smoker here who just quit. I wanna murder my cat for staring at me loudly. And this is only the first day. When will I be able to talk to my friends and family again without losing them? I literally can't control my temper, it just happens and I snap without thinking and only realize it after the fact and it sucks.

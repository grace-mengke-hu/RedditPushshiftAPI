Day 1, first time trying

I started smoking 6 months ago, not nearly as long as many of you. But as soon as I started, I smoked as much as I could. It was an instant stress reliever that I needed to get myself through school, work and depression. I wasn't ready to quit a week ago as my friends started quitting and they wanted me to join them. But last night I went for a run, and after my chest was on fire with me coughing like crazy. 

Not sure what this post is for, just wanted to get that all out somewhere. Many of your stories on here is a huge motivational factor on getting me to keep going. Thanks for that.

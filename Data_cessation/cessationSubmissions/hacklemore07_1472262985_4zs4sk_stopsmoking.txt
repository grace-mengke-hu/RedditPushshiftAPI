Running to the other side of the world to quit smoking

Im half german and half Indonesian. Thats important to note because smoking cigarettes is a huge part of their culture (or at least from the parts where i was raised). I am 19 now and have been smoking for 4 and a half years. Now that I'm moving away to study in Canada where the environment is different and i actually need to save my money i hope ill finally be able to stop. Wish me luck!

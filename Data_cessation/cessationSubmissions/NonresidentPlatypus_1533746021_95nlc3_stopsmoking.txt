Hour #36

Holy shit guys. I am 36 hours clean from nicotine. What the fuck! This is crazy and I didn’t think I’d be able to say that with how quickly the decision was made. 


The cravings and withdrawals are real though. I want a ciggie so bad, yesterday I kept one sitting in front of me so I could question myself on if I wanted the cig free hours or one cig, clearly I wanted the hours. Oh don’t forget about the withdrawals too. I literally woke up in a pool of sweat this morning. 

Any suggestions? I’ve been drinking a lot a lot a lot of water.

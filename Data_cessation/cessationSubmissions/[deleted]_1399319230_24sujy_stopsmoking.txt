Stressful day

Really stressful day with work and co-workers. I really wanted to smoke all day. Then it hit me! I really wanted to go running instead! It was amazing! This craving to want to run was more powerful than the craving for a smoke. Sadly due to a busy day today, I was unable to go running. However I will be hitting the pavement tomorrow night. (P.S. Didn't smoke! 3 days gone...another day strong!)

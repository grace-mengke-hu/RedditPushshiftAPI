Have to start all over

4 weeks ago i deciced to stop smoking. This subreddit was a great help. Two weeks ago i deciced to smoke ....just one cigarette...

here i am 2 weeks and 6 packs later :(
Today is my first day again. Its been 20 hours and i am just here sitting and crying when i think about how rough the first week was the last time.
 
Try always to remember how hard the first week was when you are about to become weak.

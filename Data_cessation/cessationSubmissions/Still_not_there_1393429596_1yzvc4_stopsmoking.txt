After how long did you stop thinking about cigarettes in the usual situations? (after coffee, in the morning, at the bus stop)

I'm asking because for me the cravings stopped after a short while, but it took a year for the thoughts about cigarettes to stop. Every time I had a coffee and every time I was waiting for the bus. And don't even get me started on the times I drank beer.

When did your automatic reference to cigarettes get reset?

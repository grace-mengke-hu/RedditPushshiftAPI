Got drunk and hung out with my friend. She smoked all night-I didn't!

You know what? The going outsidefor five minutes every time a craving was kicking in and watching someone else smoke and knowing I wouldn't give in just felt amazing. The whole time I kept thinking about how good I will feel when I woke up knowing that in the face of wine and smokers, I am okay ^_^

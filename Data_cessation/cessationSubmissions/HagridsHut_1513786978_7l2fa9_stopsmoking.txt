Got a cold...not so bad as a non-smoker!

I've got my first winter cold right now.  When I was smoking, I would still smoke while I was sick (unless I was really really sick) and of course, that would make things worse.  

I've not smoked in 41 days, and this cold is a cinch.  I'm already feeling better!  So, here's more inspiration for all of my fellow quitters--when you get sick, it won't be as bad!

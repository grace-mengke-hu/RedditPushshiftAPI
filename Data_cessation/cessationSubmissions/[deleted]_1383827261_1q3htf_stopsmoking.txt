For those who smoke 1 or two cigarettes occasionally. once every two weeks and define yourself "social smokers". I hate you.

So yesterday I was at dinner at a friends with two "social smokers": ("Just one after dinner, you know") and myself, ex smoker, smoked for 15 years and quit last year with Champix, started smoking again "occasionally" a few months ago and now clean again for 1 month. 

I still struggle, I don't like when people smoke in front of me, especially if they know I quit. Well, after dinner the decided they had to smoke, in the living room where I was staying. And they say they are not smokers, but cannot ever make an effort to avoid it when I am there. 
I have hyperthyroidism probably because of this, you know it, and you still smoke in front of me?

Sorry I am pissed. At that moment I was only able to ask them to smoke by the window and tut silently. I know I am not a patient ex smoker, but I can't help it. 

Anyone experiencing the same? How do you cope with these situations?

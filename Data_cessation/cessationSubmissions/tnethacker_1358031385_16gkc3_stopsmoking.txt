12 days without smoking and i have a HUGE problem with drinking...

The problem is that i am getting "immune" to alcohol. Seriously. I just had a half a bottle of whiskey last weekend and didn't even have a hangover the next morning. Now i've just drank a bottle of whiskey but i feel as sober as a person can ever feel (not in one go though...). 

Now, don't get me wrong. I feel funny, but not drunk. I would never go out and drive or do anything stupid.

So has anyone else had the same stuff happen to them?

4 years smoke free

I've almost forgot about this app but today I've got a notification that there are 4 years since I quit smoking:

&gt; Since Oct 22, 2014: 
&gt; 1461 days smoke free,
&gt; 36,537 down,
&gt; $5,480 and 152 days saved!

Four years and one day ago I thought it's impossible to quit and that I will never quit.

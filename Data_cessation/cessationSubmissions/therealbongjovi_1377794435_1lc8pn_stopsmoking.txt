BOOM! SEVEN DAYS!!

I didn't think this day would come, but it has! One week cigarette free! Thanks for all the words of encouragement StopSmoking! You guys are great and have really helped out. I didn't think that it would be as easy as it has, but I guess I was finally ready to quit. Now on to the next 7 and the next 7 and the next!

Keep your head up and stay strong! YOU CAN DO IT!

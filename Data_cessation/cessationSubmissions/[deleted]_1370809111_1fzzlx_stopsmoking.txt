Missing out on "social smoking"?

I really want to quit smoking. The health, the money, the smell, etc. The only fear I have is just that a lot of my friends smoke, and let's face it. There's another side to parties and social occasions that only smokers belong to. I'm afraid of losing touch with people socially because they're out smoking and socializing while I'm not. 

This might seem like an "excuse" but it really concerns me. I don't want to miss out on anything socially just because I don't smoke. If any of you had this problem, how did it actually go after you quit smoking?

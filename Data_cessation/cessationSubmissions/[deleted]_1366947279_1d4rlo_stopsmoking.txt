I'm wavering right now, I need to vent to keep myself from falling

I'm in the middle of drinking tonight, I'm trying to prove to myself I can drink without smoking.  I did it last night, but tonight it's a little harder.  Every sip of the liquor I take, my throat yearns for a cigarette to accompany the sweet burn of alcohol.  Right now I'm thinking "I'm just going to fail at quitting anyway, I might as well do it sooner than later."


I know it's just my troll brain talking.  The urge to buy a pack will probably be gone in 10 minutes tops, so I am typing this to keep myself busy.  Hopefully by the time I am done writing this out, the temptation will be gone.


Edit: Made it through, no problems.  Sometimes, you just gotta keep yourself occupied during those 3 minutes when the nicotine cravings attack.    


Edit: out again on a Friday.  Just typing this to kill time until the craving passes.  Keeping myself busy and all that.

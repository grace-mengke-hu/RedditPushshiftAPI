I just achieved something I never thought possible. I just lasted a 4 day music festival with no cigarettes.

I quit smoking about 19 days ago. When I quit, I knew there would be a massive obsticle: a long weekend music festival that I had bought tickets to. I've been to this festival for a few years now and every time I bring a 30 or 50g pouch of tobacco and smoke most of it (I tell myself that I give lots away, but in reality I smoke basically non stop,  maybe 30 cigarettes or more a day). The freedom to drink and smoke is actually one of the appeals of the festival, as the place I live prohibits smoking in cafes, pubs and nightclubs, even outside. 

This time round I bought a card of gum and an ecigarette. I chewed 4 gums over the weekend and vaped whenever cravings hit. It was fairly easy to resist smoking, even though my friends were all smoking heavily and my quit buddy temporarily fell off the wagon.  

Long story short,  I am really really really proud of myself for this achievement. This was a major hurdle, but I did it and, even better, it was not deeply uncomfortable or irritating. 

The only downside was that for the *first* time since quitting I noticed my sense of smell was back. I noticed this while in line for the portaloos on the second night, before they had been cleaned. :(

Still, worth it. :)

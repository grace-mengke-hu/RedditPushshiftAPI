What do I do about the unbridled rage I feel when I try to quit?

I'm trying to quit, but every time I wake up without a cigarette I feel nothing but murderous rage. I'm temporarily insane, I have no idea what I'm doing and saying and I feel terrible about it afterwards. I feel pure rage and the irresistible need to destroy things. How to avoid this?

The resistance was strong with this one ✊

I’m posting this mostly as something to go back to in moments of weakness, but also if there’s even a tiny chance that it helps anyone else, then that’s the icing... 

I went to a friend’s crazy-ass annual Halloween party last night. MUCH drinking was involved, but also MUCH smoking was involved- and I really was tempted- but I resisted. 

I’ve tried to quit so many times in the past, and what would get me right back into smoking was the faulty rationalization of “just one cigarette,” especially after drinking or if something really stressful happened. The fact that I didn’t even attempt the “just one” excuse is huge for me.

I’m only 16 days in, but I hope this bodes well for the future months and years. We’ve got this!

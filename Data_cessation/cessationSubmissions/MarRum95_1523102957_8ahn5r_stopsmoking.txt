How to cope with lack of concentration and depersonalization?

Hello everyone! This is my first posting on reddit after lurking here for some time. 

Some background information about me: I'm a 22 years old male IT student and started smoking when I was 14. Unlike a lot of people I immediately started smoking a pack (20 cigs) a day and continued doing so for 8 years. On the 5th of March I decided to quit cold turkey. This went surprisingly well but I ran into two major problems that unfortunately led to a relapse (5 cigarettes) yesterday.

1. I felt like I lost my whole personality. I can't even describe how that feels... lets just say I didn't feel like myself anymore.

2. This is the major problem: I can't focus and concentrate on literally anything. The whole time of my quit I didn't get anything done. I currently study IT and have a lot of programming work to do but I just can't seem to write code anymore. It feels like my mind is blank.. 
So to come to a point: I relapsed yesterday out of fear of failing the semester because I just can't focus on anything anymore... 

So my questions are: How do you cope with the extreme lack of concentration and the feeling of depersonalization? I feel like I could have succeeded with my attempt if I knew any strategies to battle the symptoms I mentioned above.

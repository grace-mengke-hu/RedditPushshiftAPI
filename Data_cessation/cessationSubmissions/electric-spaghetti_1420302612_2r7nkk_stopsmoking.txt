The most important part of quitting smoking is each little moment when you decide not to give in.

I found this helpful to think about when I was first quitting. Each time you're teetering on the edge of smoking - whether its an old smoker friend who's offering you a cigarette, passing by a convenience store after a stressful day, or whatever triggers your cravings - that moment when you decide not to give in is the most important moment in quitting smoking. The promises you made to yourself, the work put into planning not to smoke, the worry, the anxiety, the effort to make it to where you are now - none of that means anything compared to the actual moment when you're faced with the decision to smoke or not. So, when you find yourself there next, remember that quitting smoking is your most important goal and that not smoking is the only thing that will truly free you from this horrible addiction.

The best part is that each time you make the right decision, you're strengthening your ability to make it next time. Eventually, that moment you struggle through at first - deciding not to smoke - will come to be second nature. I only stopped 71 days ago, but already I'm relieved by how easy it is to say no when I'm faced with that moment.

To help myself through that moment when I first quit, my thoughts would go along the line of: "I want to quit smoking more than anything. Doing whatever I have to do not to smoke right now is what quitting smoking means. If I smoke now, I'll just have to go through this moment and all the others up until this point again - and it won't be any easier then than it is right now.".

Not one more puff, not ever.

Hello fellow quitters. Casstheass300 here, attempt number who the heck knows at quitting smoking and this is day one. Working through a craving so I figured I'd find something to distract myself and ended up on reddit. This will probably be just random thoughts, so if y'all make it through this thank you. Started smoking regularly when I was 15, now I'm 30. Wow holy cow it's been that long. This time I'm using patches which I've never tired before. So I am of the kind frame that this will work, I want to quit so I will. Most annoying thing so far is getting unwanted advice from lifetime non smokers. No Nancy, it's not just that easy. The most challenging thing about quitting in the past was and still is not being able to stop thinking about smoking. So yeah...that's that. Fun times.

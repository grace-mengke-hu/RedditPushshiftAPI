I've gone 4 days without a cigarette, so I guess I am quitting??

I don't know about any other smokers out there, but cigarettes when I am hungover is just about the last thing I want. Usually this is how it is for me... Not only did I probably have about 15 cigarettes the night before at the bar with friends who are most likely smoking as well... but the thought of smoking while my world is spinning and the light is my enemy, is just not appealing- at all. 

So, needless to say, New Years Day was one of those days. 
I managed to go the whole day without a cigarette, but like I said, that is nothing out of the ordinary. What is out of the ordinary is that the next day, I once again went without a cigarette, or a thought of one. 
Yesterday, the third day, I made it to about 3:00 in the afternoon without a thought of a cigarette, and then... it hit me. All the sudden my mouth was watering, the cigarettes sitting outside on my patio table were screaming my name, and I couldn't stop thinking about a cigarette. I kept telling myself "this is your 3rd day, why screw it up now?" I even found some comfort in eating sour things, but the urges were so intense. I managed to make it through, without breaking down and giving in, but damn was it hard. I couldn't stop thinking if this was going to get any better. 
Today, now the fourth day and I haven't had a cigarette yet, the cravings haven't been as intense as yesterday and I don't feel like dying yet, so that's good. 

I don't really have a plan, I am not even sure why I am quitting, all I know is that I have made it 4 damn days and I don't want to stop now.

About one week without smoking, started up again, how bad will tomorrow be?

I smoked 3 cigarettes today because I figured it would ease my withdrawal symptoms.  Will I be as addicted as I was when I was smoking a pack a day?  I threw the rest away and recommitted myself to quitting smoking.  How bad will tomorrow be do you think as far as the urge to smoke is concerned?  I was doing well and since I have recommitted myself to quitting smoking I do not think it will be as bad as stopping cold turkey from a multi-year pack a day habit was like last week.

No more smokes.

I have 2 smokes left in my pack, and I am going to toss my lighters and ashtrays away once I ash that last butt.  I am going to be going through some wicked withdrawals in the next few days/ weeks.  I am not looking forward to this.  Any words of wisdom/ encouragement will be appreciated.  I have smoked for almost 25 yrs.  I feel this could be painful.  *sighs

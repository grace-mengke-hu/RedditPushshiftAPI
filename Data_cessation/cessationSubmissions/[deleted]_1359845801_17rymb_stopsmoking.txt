Starting with Chantix on Monday...what to expect? 

I just got prescribed Chantix and I've heard mixed stories about it's effectiveness.  I just don't want to expect it to be this miracle worker when it's not.  So I'm interested in hearing what you guys have to say about it.  Does it eliminate cravings entirely?  Is the weird dreams side effect really as crazy as I've heard?  Overall, what was your experience with it?  And what should I expect?

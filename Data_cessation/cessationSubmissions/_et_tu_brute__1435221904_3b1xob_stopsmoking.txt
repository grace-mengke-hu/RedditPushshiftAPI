100 days down! Do I have to lose my still smoking friend?

In the past I was never able to quit for more than a few weeks or maybe a month, used many different quit aids in the past. Pack a day for the last 10 years. I spent the last year hating my habit and constantly struggling between addiction and the desire to quit. I finally went cold turkey and haven't looked back.

The strangest things for me so far have been... 

1. No desire to ever smoke again. Previous quits I convinced myself that I could have one or two here or there after x amount of time. I am comfortable with the idea of never having another one.

2. I don't experience cravings but I still have thoughts about smoking. Example, I'm at a gas station, *I should buy a pack* then realize I'm not a smoker. Or get urge that it is *time to go outside* realize that is no longer part of my world.

3. It has negatively impacted my relationship with my best friend. :( We use to drink coffee and smoke together and chat. We still drink coffee and she still smokes but it's different now. It is so gross that I don't want to be around her. She knows that I quit but makes no attempt to not smoke around me. I understand that and try not to be the reformed smoker. During previous quit sessions would offer me smokes when she knew I had quit/would make comments about how I would be smoking again soon.

We've stopped hanging out but I miss her as a person and our friendship. I never realized how much our relationship revolved around smoking. She came over to my house during the first few weeks of my quit and asked if she could smoke inside which we use to do. I told her I would prefer she didn't since I'm not smoking anymore and she kind of threw a fit about it.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I cannot imagine how much harder this situation would be if she was my significant other instead of just my friend.

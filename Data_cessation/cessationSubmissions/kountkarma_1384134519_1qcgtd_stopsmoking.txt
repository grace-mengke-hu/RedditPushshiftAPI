Stopped in to check my badge because I forgot how long it's been. Feels like two weeks... actually 8 days.

Carried 50 lb backpack on a bike against a 15 mph wind gaining elevation over about a mile- lungs didn't hurt or wheeze I thought I must be close to two weeks (didn't know I don't check calanders or clocks very often).  Just 8 days and I feel this great?  Wow.

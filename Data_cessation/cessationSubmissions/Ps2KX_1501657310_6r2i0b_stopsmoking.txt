I quit as well!

I quit today as well. No e-cigs for me, I am using a nicotine patch. For me the main problem is breaking the habit around smoking. I light up when I am bored and really at fixed times.
The patch will surpress the withdrawal (and it will also prevent me from lighting up a cig.. seriously don't smoke with a patch on.)

I have been smoking for about 21 years now and this will be my second serious quitting attempt. (I can't even remember a day where I didn't smoke...)
The first attempt to quit was several years ago, this failed due to me cheating on myself. This time I have my gf to keep me from cheating.

It's only been two hours and I keep telling myself I don't want to smoke (because of the patch) and it's just a habit. (Albeit a difficult one to break)

My main reason for quitting is simply... I am fed up with it, my stumach is hurting from stumach acid to the point it wakes my up in the night, I don't enjoy smoking as much anymore. And of course having a gf who doesn't smoke really helps.

I replaced my Zippo with a Figdet cube, put washing liquid on all remaining cigs I had and cleaned and stored all ashtrays. So wish me luck! And of course best of luck and strenght to all other quitters in this sub!!

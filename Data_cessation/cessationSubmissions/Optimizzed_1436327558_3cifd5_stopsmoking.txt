Day 5, I don't desire a cigarette but...

I am fuming. I hate the sound of my roomates voice giggling on the phone next to me. I just want her to fucking leave and let me be alone. Come to think of it, hearing almost anyone talk pissed me off today. On the bus there was a woman talking so loudly in a stupid accent I hated hr so much. I want them all to shut the fuck up.

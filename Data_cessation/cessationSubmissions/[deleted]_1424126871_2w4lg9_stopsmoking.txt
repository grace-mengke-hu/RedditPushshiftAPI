An apology.

Ok, so last time I visited this sub was 1.5 years ago. Obviously it didn't go well at all. I lied to myself about quitting, I lied to my friends, and even lied to this sub.

At the time, I managed to cut down from a pack a day to about 3 cigarettes a day. Unfortunately, I told everyone I'd completely quit. *I even somehow convinced myself I'd quit, even though I was still smoking!* Slowly I slipped back to my old habits, until I was back to a pack a day.

So, here I am again, a year and a half later. 7 days without a cigarette. No more lies and excuses - I'm truly quitting this time.

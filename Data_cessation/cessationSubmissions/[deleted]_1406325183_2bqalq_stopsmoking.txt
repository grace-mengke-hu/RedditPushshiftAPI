What's the best quit smoking app (iphone)?

Thanks a lot for everyone's help regarding my experience with the Allen Carr book. It helped me a lot. By the looks of it now - they might try and have me back for another seminar for free, but I'll see how everything pans out. Just curious what quit smoking apps you guys are using. This is a little off topic but today I just found an app called 'myfitnesspal' it's a calorie counter & diet tracker it's a really amazing app for losing weight, not for everyone though.

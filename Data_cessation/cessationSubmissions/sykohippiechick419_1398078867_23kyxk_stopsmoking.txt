smoke free for 100 + hours

just thought I'd introduce myself and fill you in on my story. my name is Chrissy, I am 37 years young,  and I was just diagnosed with copd. I have been smoke free since 4/17 but I have been hospitalized since then. today is a big day for me. I am gettin outta here :) that makes me very happy. I am very worried however. I don't want to get out of here and be surrounded by all my friends and family who smoke, but I don't want to shun everyone who does. any suggestions on how to overcome this are very welcomed. good luck to everyone. love and light to all

Just got Allen Carrs book. Had some questions

I began reading and got to about chapter 5 already. I must say, even the short while of reading, he has effectively communicated to my brain that smoking is a disgusting thing to do and using willpower just doesn't work for me. 
My question is, at what point did you know that the book worked? Also, he tells you to keep smoking through the book but km a slow reader and not sure if I should be worried if it takes me longer than normal. 
Either way I'm excited to read this whole thing and hope I get out of this lifestyle. 

You guys rule. Thank you.

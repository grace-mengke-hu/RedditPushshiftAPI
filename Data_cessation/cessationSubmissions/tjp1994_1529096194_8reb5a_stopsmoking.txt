How can I convince my dad to stop smoking?

My dad has been smoking for 40 + years and I don’t think there is a single thing in this universe that could ever make him stop. He is such a slave to it it’s unbelievable. He is so in denial too, like whenever anyone mentions it he quickly changes the subject lol or makes a joke to sort of do anything to not go there. It is so annoying because it’s like he cares about everything else and is so caring yet it’s like he is living in denial that it is gonna kill him. Like he is just carrying on like a person walking through traffic blindfolded in denial, like it’s not gonna happen to him. 

It’s so annoying because he literally has never tried anything and could never be separated from his tobacco pouch. Even got him a vapouriser and Kerry gaynor hypnosis videos, shock nothing came or those, didn’t get around to watching them probably had too much smoking to do.

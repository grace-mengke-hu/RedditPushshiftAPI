Need help....

How do I even start quitting? I'm almost done with the carton I think I have 6 packs left. Need some ideas on how to be done. It makes me feel like crap and I really want to quit. It seems like everytime I try to quit something extremely stressful happens. It seems like it's way to much to handle without smoking.

Edit: thanks for the link and encouragement. I counted out how many packs I have left and it was 6. I'm going to try cold turkey after the last pack. I can do this I know I can.

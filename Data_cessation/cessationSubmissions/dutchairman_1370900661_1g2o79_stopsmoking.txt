This time I mean it.

After quitting more times than I can count, I was off cigarettes for most of this last year.  I'm in my late 20s and finishing up my four year college degree and picked up smoking only for midterms and finals.  After finals week last month, I had the hardest time letting go, and that's when I knew I had to make a decision to submit to it forever or leave it behind for good.  I was going to do the former until my best friend quit and I decided to join him.

I watched an hour and a half long Allen Carr video and the way he broke down the disadvantages and "advantages" of smoking made me realize that they were only making me miserable 24/7 rather than doing me any good whatsoever.  I will not become a smoker again.  Ever.

Day 8, 9 at noon

I have noticed a lot of things so far. I take the bus a lot, so not carrying my e cigarette everywhere is a huge plus. Most of all, it's not being hooked to something. I dunno about you, but I am a huge chain smoker, so I just can't stop when I have the time to smoke. Now I can enjoy the scenery, not just looking for smoking spots and stuff and sticking to those spots until the bus gets there. I am still wondering where my e cigarette is sometimes and have small cravings, but it is getting better with time. I'm also surprised I have no cravings when smelling cigarette smoke, probably because I'm quitting vaping more than cigarettes. But, it's nice to be able to sit with my boyfriend as he's smoking :).

Yeah, my boyfriend smokes, but he wants to quit, too. We had an agreement to try to quit together, so I'm taking a shot at it and hope to quit before he does.

Quitting with chantix

I'm on day 5 without a ciggarette! I've been taking chantix and my doctor warned me about mood swings and irritability and so on which I expected to happen (if it was going to) within the first few days of taking the medicine.  None of that ever really happened, just nausea... I took chantix for 21 days and quit smoking on day 22.  In the last 5 days since quitting I have been understandably moody but I have had 2 panic attacks, one this morning and the other happened 2 days ago.  I have never had panic attacks before, so I'm wondering if they are just from quitting or if maybe the chantix could be causing it? Anyone have anything similar happen or any advice about handling these panic attacks? Thanks for any help and advice!

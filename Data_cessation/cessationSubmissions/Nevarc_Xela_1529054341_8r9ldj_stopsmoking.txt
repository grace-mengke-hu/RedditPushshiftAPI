I'm on day 5. I'm exhausted.

Hey guys, First time posting here. Decided to stop smoking last friday, my family hates it and I hate the taste/smell. So I decided to go to the E-cig shop and get myself a little tooter. 

I'm SUPER tired for some unknown reason. But I'm going to keep on stopping! I normally have 5-10 per day but now I'm on 0! It's working a treat, I still have to give myself the habit of going outside and tooting though, otherwise I don't feel like I've had a smoke. Is that normal?

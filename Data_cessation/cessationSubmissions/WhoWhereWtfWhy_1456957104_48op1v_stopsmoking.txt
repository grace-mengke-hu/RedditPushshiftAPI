Five months or so since I went cold turkey... Headaches WTF.

I lost count of the days but definitely over 5 months.  I'm a healthy, fit 31 year old male, I quit cold turkey with no vaping or drugs like Chantix... Completely 100% unaided full stop.  After 2 weeks I started to feel amazing and full of energy but also a little snappy to others at times... 
  
Then 3 weeks hit and I just started to have a mild headache every waking hour of every day.  So, basically I've had a head ache for about 4 months.  Doctors shrug and say things like "probably still having withdrawal symptoms".  What?  5 months later?  Caffeine and Ibuprofen offer relief but it's still present.  I drink PLENTY of water (I swear to god if one more person self righteously tells me to drink more water I'm going to stab them in the fucking neck.)  I run, I exercise, had a check up and doctors were impressed at my heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygenation was 99%.  I don't drink energy drinks or soda of any kind, I never have.  My diet is variable with meat, plants, grains and water with unprocessed food being had as little as possible.  I drink about a 2 cups of coffee a day in the morning which seems to have no affect on the headaches for better or worse.  Alcohol seems to erase the head ache after 3 or 4 beers, which is nice and everything but I'd really like it if I didn't have to drink 36 ounces of beer to just feel nice and mellow.
  
GRRRRRRR.... What the fuck is going on?  I'm so sick of this shit.  Doctors = unhelpful, other smokers = unhelpful, internet = unhelpful "Drink more water."  Apparently everyone is always dehydrated and can never stop drinking water?  I drink at the very least 2 liters (around 4 pints) a day, more if I feel parched.
  
Has this happened to anyone else?  It's the only thing bothering me since I quit smoking, but man is it a doozey.  HALP!

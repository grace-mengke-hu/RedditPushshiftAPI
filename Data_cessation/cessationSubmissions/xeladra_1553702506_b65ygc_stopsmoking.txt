7 months quit. i don’t want cigarettes, but i’m so angry

I feel like ever since I quit smoking 7 months ago I’ve been more angry/had a short temper. i used to smoke when i was angry or frustrated, and now i don’t, i feel like i don’t get relief. i was wondering if anybody had any good healthy habits i could try to release some anger without cigarettes. I tried drinking water/tea but it doesn’t seem to calm me down like a cigarette used to

How many vape hits at 3mg/ml equal smoking a cigarette? (Looking for a rough estimate)

Hey Guys,

I’m on week 4-5 without smoking. I did this mainly with patches but they started to make me feel incredibly ill. I’ve switched to vaping and bought the lowest amount of nicotine I could find, I intend to use this to take the edge off and break the smokers habit and then switch to 0mg eliquids and be free of nicotine. 

What I don’t want to do is start to build up my bodies need for nicotine again by using it too much. Being strict isn’t that easy when the cravings are getting the better of me, and basically impossible when I don’t have any real idea how much i’m inhaling. It’s also very easy to find myself chain vaping.

I’m hoping for information like “5 hits on your Zelos vape with 3mb/ml liquid is roughly one cig/2 roll ups” - that way I can make sure I don’t over do it and can more easily reduce the amount i’m having each day/week. 

I know accuracy is going to be an issue but lets go with the with the average cigarette (I actually smoked hand rolled Golden Virginia roll ups), and the average hit size. A ball park figure will be enough of a guide for me. 

Thanks for your help guys, this place is literally saving my life.

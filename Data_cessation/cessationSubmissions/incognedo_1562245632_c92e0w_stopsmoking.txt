Relapsed after a week, back to day one

Title pretty much says it all. Made it a week without even thinking about smoking after finishing Allen Carrs book and then just came crashing down hard on the weekend and bought a pack. Feel really crappy because I know how good it felt to be smoke free that week and now I'm just disappointed in myself.  Just wanted to post here as I have no one IRL to really talk to about this so I'm feeling pretty alone in the battle.

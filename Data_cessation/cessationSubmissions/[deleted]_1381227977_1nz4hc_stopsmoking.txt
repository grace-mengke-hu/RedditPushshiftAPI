Suffering for the rest of my life?

I don't really know how long I've been quitting now, because I've been on the gum this whole time and every second day smoking one pipe in the evening, without inhaling, but still smoking. One thing I can say for sure is that I haven't bought any cigarettes for two weeks as of today.

But yesterday I decided to say no to gum too, I don't want to be addicted to anything. Today however thongs got more difficult. I'm extremely angry and sad. Came here to cheer myself up and saw a couple of posts about relapse. One guy started to smoke even after several years of not smoking because he had cravings!

So...can you please answer me honestly: Will the rest of my life will be this horrific cravings for cigarettes every day? Is this what I am going to think about for the rest of my days?

And please, don't bother to lie to "help" or something. Just the truth even if it's ugly. I can chew gum if needed for eternity, cows are creatures too...

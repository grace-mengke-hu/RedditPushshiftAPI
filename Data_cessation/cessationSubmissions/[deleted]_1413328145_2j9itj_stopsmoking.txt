I wonder if annoyance with smokers, by ex-smokers, is a pre-frontal lobes thing. Just wondering.

Quit smoking and I become a self-righteous ex-smoker, turning up my nose at the smell, irritated that I have to stop the home movie so my wife can smoke. Etc. Etc. We become kind of irritating.

Quitting smoking takes some willpower (even if you have the flash of illumination from Allen Carr). Willpower and restraint come from the highest part of our brains, the pre-frontal cortex. We kind of become Mr. Spock, all reason, a little disconnected from our normal empathy. In other words, kind of irritating.

Is that a good explanation? Not that it matters much. If you need to be a little irritating for a while to quit smoking, go for it. Just wondering.

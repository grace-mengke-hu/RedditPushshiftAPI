I Quit.

It's been 34 hours. I'd been contemplating to quit (sincere thoughts) only in the past few weeks. 

About 2-3 weeks ago I turned my life around, or at least made a huge step towards doing so by stopping smoking weed. The domino effect then follow whereby I made a decision to also never drink alcohol again, and to never gamble again. 

I am 25 years old and you can refer to my post history to gain some perspective. I posted on r/leaves a few weeks ago describing my experience with marijuana addiction. 

So anyway, I knew cigarettes were my biggest addiction. By far. 

Some of you may not believe me but God has helped me a lot and He has given me the strength to embark on yet another impossible journey. It's fine if you disagree, I don't want a religious debate going on below. 

It's the first time I'm quitting smoking after 7.5 years. Bear in mind, throughout 90% of the 7.5 years I was HAPPY to be a cigarette smoker. It just gave me a much needed break and it was just a regular escape method for my colleagues, friends, classmates and i. I never actually even thought about quitting. 

I walk 1.5 miles to 2 miles every day on average and have been doing so for the past 9 years. I repeat : I've walked an average of 1.5 miles to 2 miles every single day for the past 9 years. I would take multiple cigs during those walks. Now I'm looking forward to enjoying those walks without the cig (already have walked a couple of miles in the last 30 hours) and I hope that I can see a significant improvement in all aspects physically and mentally. 

Its been about 34 hours. I passed my first test yesterday by not caving into the cravings at school and on my way to and fro. 

Did I mention that when I decided to quit I couldn't sleep all night? At 4/5 am I decided to grab my pack of cigarettes(3/4 full), lighter, and other paraphernalia - and tossed them in the garbage can across the street? Yes, I did that. 


I quit.

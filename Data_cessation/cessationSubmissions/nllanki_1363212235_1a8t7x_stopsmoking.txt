The cough - stopped smoking and yet it persists

Hi all. So I've been smoke free for almost two weeks (since Friday 1st March). Quit cold turkey and it's going well - more or less over the cravings stage and successfully circumnavigated a night in the pub. I'd been smoking for five years. And yet I've still got this horrific chesty throaty cough.

I expected to cough up some of the gunk that's taken root in my lungs but this seems excessive. I'm coughing that badly at times I can barely breath. 

Has anyone else experienced similar? I know it's normal to cough up mucus and such but this seems abnormal. At what point do I start checking in with the doctor?

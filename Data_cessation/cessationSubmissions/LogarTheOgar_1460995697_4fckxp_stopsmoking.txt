At 9am this morning it was one full week

I've tried quitting many times before. I've used nicotine gum, patches, lozenges; none of that shit works. I read an article a few weeks ago that said most successful quitters don't use NRT at all. When I read that, it clicked that patches and things just prolong the addiction.

Cigarettes are around $9 here. I've been smoking for about 10 years, and at least a pack a day for the past 6.

I decided to quit when one day I was smoking and realized "...I don't even like these."

I ate a lot of candy and removed myself from a lot of social situations prematurely just because I knew if I stayed my monkey-brain would kick in and want to be "included in this great pastime."

Ferrero rocher chocolates, fruit juice, cinnamon gum, and a white board with the amount of money not spent.

And of course reading this thread almost every day for more encouragement and strategies.

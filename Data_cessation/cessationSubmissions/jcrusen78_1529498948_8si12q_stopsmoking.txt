Alan Carr’s book. Loved it. Lasted 14 days. Advice needed

I just purchased my last pack of cigarettes yesterday. When they are gone I plan to stop smoking. I have tried everything from prescription medication, patches, lozenges,vaping, and the last time cold turkey. You guys, this is my one vice and I would love to say goodbye to it forever. The problem is that when going cold turkey I become extremely agitated, high tempered, mean, grumpy, fly off the handle at the smallest inconveniences, and basically just miserable to be around. You know it’s bad when my family who wants me to live a longer healthier life say, just go back to smoking. I am sincerely that bad to be around. I plan on reading the book again but any additional advice or pointers would greatly help me. Also, I am sorry for the posts that will be made over the next several weeks. I will be needing lots of room to vent and also support in this journey. Thank you all!

Reading Alan Carr's Easyway - Question for people who have used his method.

I'm 10 hours removed from nicotine and reading the book. He states, "Provided that you are not a non-smoker or an ex-smoker, it is essential to keep smoking until you have finished the book completely."

Is this a good idea or critical to the process? Every inch of my crawling skin wants to keep smoking until I'm through with the book, but if it's not a critical step, I figure I only have another 60ish hours of nicotine actually in my bloodstream, and it's all downhill after that. 

I so badly want to keep smoking and would if it weren't smelly, poor tasting and going to eventually kill me. I've been smoking for roughly 15 years, at least a pack a day for 12-13 of those. It's time to quit before my heart does.

-edit-

Back to zero hours. Time to keep reading. Thanks for the advice and words of encouragement, everybody.

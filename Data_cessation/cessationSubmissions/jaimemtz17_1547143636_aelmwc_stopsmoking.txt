Strongest trigger?

Hey everyone, this is my first post here!

I'm on 3 days, 14 hrs, 0 m when I started typing this post. I used to be a pack a day smoker for around 10 years, I've tried quitting multiple times before but have never been successful, I believe in myself that this time it will be different. 

I need to stop because of health issues, nothing major on myself at the moment, but if I don't stop, then sooner rather than later I'll start having health issues (runs in the family). My girlfriend doesn't really mind me smoking, but doesn't approve it either. I had been telling her and myself for the last few months of 2018 that I would stop smoking on January 1, 2019 and I did, but it didn't last much. Didn't smoke as soon as I woke up Jan. 1st, and by thursday night I met with some friends and caved, I did want to smoke, a lot, and didn't resist. I ended up smoking through the weekend and by sunday night I said I would finish that pack and give it another go. Here I am, at work, scared of caving tonight. 

For the last 15 years or so, I've gathered with friends (group of around 30 persons, usually at least 10 meet up) every single thursday night and light up a grill, cook some dinner and just have some fun catching up and talking about our weeks, no matter the weather or date, we always gather up. It's **MY** night out with the boys, it has always been and it won't ever stop being. I'm afraid to cave in tonight, but I will not miss it, so I must be strong and accept that I don't smoke anymore.

Wish me luck tonight!

Missing the Appeal?

Alright guys, so I'm 3 days in and I'm doing pretty okay. The only thing  is, I miss the look and feel of smoking. Not necessarily the feeling it gives you but the whole look of it. I know it sounds weird, but you know, sometimes a cigarette just felt right in the situation. I know this is just the nicotine talking, but it's making quitting kind of tough. I've only smoked for a year and so I'm also getting these thoughts like "meh, you've only smoked a year, whats a couple more months?". Just needed to rant a bit, but it sucks, ya know?

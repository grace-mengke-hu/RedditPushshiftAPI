12 days in. Allow me to introduce myself and the arguably horrible time I've decided to quit.

10 years or so of a pack a day. Never was one for lights, did camel filters, reds, an odd Nat Sherman or English oval. 

Stuff that puts hair on your chest.

Well about 7 and a half months ago my wife and I conceived our first child. And growing up with smoking parents, as did my wife ( she was a light smoker, quit 2 or so years ago), I knew I didn't want my child to ever see me smoke.... So I've been building up to it. 

As of right now I'm 7 weeks to fatherhood d-day, and shoulder deep in a 'down-to-the-studs' bathroom renovation. But you know what... There will always be a reason to say one more week.... And Wednesday the 17th was it. No more.

I've been using an ecig to stave off the nicotene Jones and to still allow myself the step away so I'm not hostile times at work and home. I've also been keeping a pack in my car as a 'fuck you, I can face temptation and win' sort of thing.

So here I am. 12 days in. So far. So good.

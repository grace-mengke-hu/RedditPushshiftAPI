I'm really struggling

Coming up on 3 weeks now and I wish I could say I'm just going through one particularly difficult craving, but this whole WEEK has been a real struggle. I think about smoking all the time. I want a cigarette soooo fucking bad. I know - intellectually - that one cigarette leads to a pack a day and all that shit, no such thing as just one puff, I KNOW all that. But I don't CARE. I just want to fucking smoke. I'm in my room right now and literally all I can think about it going downstairs to the corner shop and buying a pack and chain-smoking the lot.

I don't want to be a smoker anymore, I really don't - I've quit so many times and every time I'm back on them I hate them and I hate myself for being such an addict. But right now I don't care about any of that - I just want to smoke :(

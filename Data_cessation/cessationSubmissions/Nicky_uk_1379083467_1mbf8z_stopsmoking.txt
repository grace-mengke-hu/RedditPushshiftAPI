Day 5 and still going

Well, I am into day 5 and still going by the skin of my teeth... cravings seem to be quite frequent and lasting a bit longer than they have been previously (about 20mins was the last one). Day 3 and today have been the worst really... still battling on though and hoping the days are going to get easier...keep telling myself I obviously wanted to quit even if I can't remember the reasons why when a craving comes along.. anyway..still determined so bring it on!

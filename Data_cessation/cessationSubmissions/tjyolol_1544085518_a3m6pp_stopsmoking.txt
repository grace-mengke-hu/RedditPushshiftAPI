Update (214 days)

Just popping in to say good luck to everyone taking the leap, if anyone wants my advice it is to take it one day at a time at first but really focus on how much you hate smoking in those times, although it is painful to quit smoking it is much more painful to keep smoking. I am now well into my training for a half marathon, I could only run for 1 minute while I was smoking and even that was hard. Smoking is a terrible waste of both money an life, stick at it and join me in the much-improved smoke-free life, you have got this :)

Second day and argument with girlfriend

I am almost through my second day of not smoking. And as it happens my girlfriend decides to have an argument with me as to why I didn't give her enough time to plan for her quit. Smoking was always an issue I was dealing with, and I have been trying multiple times to quit and failed every time. Beginning of the week she said I should let her know whenever I decide to quit so we can quit together but I didn't know when. On Friday morning I felt like I wanted to quit on that night, so I let her know about it. She said she wanted to quit with me. Now she is all pissed off why I didn't take her into consideration and planned and let her know ahead. I am so outrageous right now, mainly because I feel like she is being unreasonable, you all know what it is to just feel like quitting right? Or is it just me who can't plan ahead? I am badly craving a cigarette right now, and I know if I do so it'll not only make me disappointed in me but in her as well.

Day 4, vaping with 0 mg juice

So I quit cold turkey, but Im having a hard time deciding today if continuing to use the vape is just torturing myself.. sucking away but unable to get the relief of nicotine. Or if its giving me that need to draw in and blow out vape/smoke.. and mentally giving me a little relief. A couple more days and I will be feeling less moody and raw, just gotta keep moving forward and not cave.

Do you believe that smoking could be harmless after all?

Hey everyone.

You might think that I'm paid by the tobacco industry or whatever but I can assure you it's not the case. I'm someone that quitted smoking for almost a month before relapsing for stupid reasons a few days ago, I've read Alan Carr & read a lot on whyquit.com and just before finding this topic/ebook I was almost an anti-tobacco crusader.

So here's the story, I was looking online for benefits of quitting smoking and I fell on an article a bit "conspiracy inspired" which claimed that tobacco isn't harmful after all. I was a bit surprised at first because I didn't expect a "conspiracist" website to be for and not against tobacco.

So they talk about this author and I found the ebook for free : http://wispofsmoke.net/PDFs/Whitby.pdf (maybe someone can found a better scan)

Now I just wanna hear everyone's thoughts on the topic, and also don't "feel bad" about yourself if you just quitted, remember that you saved thousands of dollar for you and your family instead of giving them to some corrupt tobacco compagnies only willing to sell your their product without caring about your health at all.

If you have other well documented I would be glad that you share them too (pro or con doesn't matter).

And while this "study/ebook" might probably apply for "natural tobacco" I'm pretty sure there is some added chemicals in nowaday cigarettes that still might be really harmful.

Sorry for broken english!

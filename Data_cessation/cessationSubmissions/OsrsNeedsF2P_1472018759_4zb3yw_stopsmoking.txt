[Help request] my friend (from a video game) smokes 4 cigs a day and regrets it every time.. How can I help him stop?

He talks about how he used to smoke a pack a day but then he bought vaping things and has since brought it down to 4 a day.. But he's such a nice person (even before smoking) and I don't know how to convince him through the screen.. Does anyone have any advice?

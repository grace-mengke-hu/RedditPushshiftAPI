Can't believe I made it to here - Can't believe it was so easy!

It's been 8 days 10 hours and 50 Minutes for me. Thing is, I grew up with the popular belief that smoking is good for you team's deffence.

As a german I can proudly conclude: It is not true! Your team can even win the greatest tournament there is without needing your "help in the deffence". :)

Will be back for double digits. Thanks r/stopsmoking, I could not have done it without you.

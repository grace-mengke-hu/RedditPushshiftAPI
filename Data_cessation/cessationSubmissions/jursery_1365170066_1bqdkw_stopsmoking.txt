Does Anyone Else Have Trouble Driving While Quitting?

Driving is normally one of my favorite things to do, it would always relax me.  Now that I'm trying to quit, I get in my car and pretty much instantly start freaking out and getting nervous.  I also feel like I'm driving like shit lately.  Is this normal?  If so, how long does it last?

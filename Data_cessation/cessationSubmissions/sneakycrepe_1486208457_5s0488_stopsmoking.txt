I'm an ex-smoker trying to get my sister to quit as well. Any advice?

I successfully quit smoking 9 months ago. My sister still smokes. We are very close in age, and both started smoking around 16-17. I quit because I was concerned for my health, and had simply had enough of the addiction. I care about my sister's health as well, and really wish she would quit so we could share the benefits of good health together.

I've briefly brought it up a couple times, because I know it will be a touchy subject, and each time dismissed it as a joke or something. 

Is there any way I can go about this without ruining our relationship, and coming across as holier-than-thou?

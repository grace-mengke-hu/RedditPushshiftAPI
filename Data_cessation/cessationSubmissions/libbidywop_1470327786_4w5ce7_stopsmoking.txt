Quitting during a tough series of events

I'm on day 1. 2 hours ago was my last one. Had chest pains waking up, tried doing back exercises at the gym, pain made me stop. In the past two weeks I have moved my apartment in 2 days. 

My girlfriend  thinks she has hiv because she blacked out and i didn't know where she was at a concert for 30 min, has a drinking problem, and is seeking help now. 

My cat died two nights ago. I had to put him down after he had kidney failure. I am devastated. 

I don't want to quit right now because I'm under a lot of stress already. But this chest pain is real, and real scary. I need this subreddit's support. Thankfully i have a few days off from work, and I'm going to my parents house to be away from my girlfriend. Pls help, anything is better than nothing.

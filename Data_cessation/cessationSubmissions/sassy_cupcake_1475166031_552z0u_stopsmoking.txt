Day 3 and going strong!

I started smoking when I went away to college at 18 to cope with the stress and have been doing it ever since. 8 years later and I've decided that enough is enough and I need to respect myself and my SO and quit.

It's been three days now and it's been surprisingly going really well. Sure, I've had a few moments where I really wanted a cig but it's been easy to tell myself no. I've been occupying all my time by working, cleaning around the house, and playing lots and lots of video games. Keeping myself busy has really helped.

It's still early days but I think I can do this, guys.

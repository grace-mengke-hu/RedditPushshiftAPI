Temporary adhd common?

At day 9 (cheated about 4 days ago while drunk) and I am feeling extremely ADD. Having trouble getting any work done at work, even after ive read far too much reddit.  Have quit before and do not remember being this ADD.

Is this something everybody went through (and is temporary)..or this something I should see the doc about?

Jan 6. Almost two months of no smoking.

It's been hard. Sometimes it's all I can think of. Other times the idea of smoking sounds ridiculous. How long before it sets in that cigarettes are bad and I never want another one. 

This is really the first time I've ever managed to stop more than a single day. I just wish I had something I really could enjoy. I've been doing weed here and there which helps a lot but I think that makes me cranky. 

Ideas?

I started high intensity circuit gym, changed my whole diet, started detoxing and quit smoking all at the same time

Been smoking for roughly 8 years and tried quitting before a few years back, haven't done any proper exercise for about the same amount of time and my diet mainly consists of high carbs and shitty food. 
  
It's day 13 and I'm doing great! I only crave cigarettes when I'm highly stressed at work, which is the hardest one to kick for me right now. Other than that, I honestly have never felt better and the whole experience so far hasn't been as hard as I thought or even as hard as make it out to be to my family.
If I could give any advice to you guys it's try find something to focus your mind and attention on and remember each craving is easier than the last one to get through.

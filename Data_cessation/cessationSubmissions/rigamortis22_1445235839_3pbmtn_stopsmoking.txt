Help!!

21 soon to be 22 and been smoking since the age of 17. This morning i woke up with no cigarettes and decided it was "a sign" to quit. Its already the end of the day and I've been fighting my cravings. I've noticed I'm easily frustrated, and prone to getting angry even at things that have never angered me before. How the fuck can I over come this? Anyone else felt this way?

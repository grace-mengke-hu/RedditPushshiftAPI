Can't stop dream smoking

19 days in, going stronger than ever. I've been taking champix however it has really amplified my dreams, and lately every night I dream about smoking. Dad went through similar thing and his dreams didn't end until after a year of being smoke free.


Dreams I don't mind but what scares me is that at first I felt guilty that I started smoking until I realised it was a dream, however lately I've been waking with a strong craving to smoke. Doesn't help I'm unemployed at the moment so I'm stress free but bored. 


Some days I regret starting smoking, other days I want to smoke.

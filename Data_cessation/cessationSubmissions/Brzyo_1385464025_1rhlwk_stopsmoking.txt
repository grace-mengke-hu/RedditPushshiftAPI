How do I quit?

I started smoking when I was 14, quit cold turkey at 17 and didn't touch even one for 2 years. After that I started smoking when I was going to bars with mates, did this for a while and then stopped it all together again. I'm 23 now.

I started smoking now and then while I was home too. Last January my GF broke up with me and I started smoking regularly again, between 3-5 cigs a day. Since this summer I'm smoking like 15 a day again. I'm more addicted than ever before now. I'm taking every excuse of stress (or when anything in particular happens, like i "need" a cig before and after a lot of things) to smoke.

I don't even like the taste I always have to drink something with it to not taste it or eat gum.

So I remember everytime I quit I didn't even look back or missed it, I was usually happy that I didn't have craving all day and had to go outside to smoke. Didn't miss it at all.

Trying to quit for a while now and I usually am like "tomorrow I quit". But in the morning I can't even go 1 hour without smoking.

So basically I know I can quit and I won't miss it but how do I get trough the first week?

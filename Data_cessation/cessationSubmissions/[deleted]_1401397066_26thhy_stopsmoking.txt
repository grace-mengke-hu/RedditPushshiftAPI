Day 1 of Cold Turkey

Just got sick of buying 'em. I live in NYS so they're priced ridiculously. I was driving out to Pennsylvania to get cartons, but what a pain the in ass that is. Smoked probably 25 cigarettes a day, 2 packs when I was at my 'worst.' 

It's been about 20hrs, I mean I feel pretty fine. I guess a little restless but I've just been chewing gum and keeping my hands busy. I've been successful in dispelling any cravings within 5-7 minutes, regardless of trigger. 

Anyways, I'm just wondering for anyone else who has done cold turkey.. is the first the worst day? Or should I brace myself for an uphill battle? I smoked like a chimney and I always heard quitting nicotine was one of the hardest things to quit. I was imagining this huge challenge and it makes me a little nervous how moderate this really has been.

Switched to an Ecig: am I just postponing the inevitable suffering?

I'm on day 2 of no cigarettes but I'm relying heavily on my ecig. I've used the Ecig to stop smoking cigarettes before and I've made it a few months before I just started smoking again when my Ecig broke. I'm serious about quitting this time. Which has me wondering; if I'm reaching for my Ecig every time I get a craving, am I really quitting? Or am I just substituting methods of delivery? Am I making any progress? 

What are your experiences? Thoughts? Opinions?

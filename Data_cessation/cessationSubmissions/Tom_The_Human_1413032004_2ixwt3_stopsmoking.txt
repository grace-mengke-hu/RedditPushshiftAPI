Are the effects of smoking on your vocal cords and lungs permanent?

Long story short: I was stupid enough to dabble in smoking over the last couple of weeks, but after seeing (or hearing) my voice go more hoarse and my lung capacity decrease, I've realised how stupid that decision was. What I want to know is is this permanent, and, if not how long will the effects linger for?

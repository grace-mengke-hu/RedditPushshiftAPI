Day 12 after going cold turkey!

Have attempted to quit many times, but never been this successful. Thinking about it a lot, but had a friend tell me to use every craving to remember this is why I'm quitting. No more excuses, I refuse to let a cigarette have this much control over me. 

Went to my parents on the weekend (who both chain smoke) and made it through without a single cigg. Feeling pretty good about that! :)

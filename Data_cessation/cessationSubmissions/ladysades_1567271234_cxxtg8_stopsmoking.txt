So frustrated

Hi guys, Iâ€™m getting so frustrated. Iâ€™m at 5 and a half days and it just seems to be getting harder. Irritation levels are through the roof, Iâ€™m crying like at least 8 times a day. Iâ€™m lucky my loved ones are being patient but I donâ€™t know if I can/should keep going if it doesnâ€™t get easier. My thoughts are so irrational and hopeless and I donâ€™t know what to do.

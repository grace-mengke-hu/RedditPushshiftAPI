During my best attempt to quit I've ever experienced, I slipped this weekend.

I've been a smoker for 10 years and have recently taken a very strong motion towards quitting. I've been extremely positive and successful this time and have felt that I have truly quit. This weekend, I slipped up pretty bad and smoked quite a bit. I'm standing strong and realizing I'm not perfect and taking this as a setback. Send some positive vibes for the struggle. One more is never enough.

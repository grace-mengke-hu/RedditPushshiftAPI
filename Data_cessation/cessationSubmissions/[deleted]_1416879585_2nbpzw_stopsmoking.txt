Smoking 2-3 per day for about 3 months. Stopping. What to expect?

I've been smoking regularly for about 3 months. Before that I've been an on and off casual smoker for about 2-3 years. Since August I've been having a couple a day, and in the past few weeks have been feeling urges to smoke while at work. I usually have one in the morning before work, one when I get home, then maybe one after dinner. On weekends I usually smoke more.

I want to use my trip to my parents' house for Thanksgiving as a time to quit. I'll be there for 5 nights. I'm just wondering what I should expect to feel in terms of urges/withdrawal? I'm honestly a little apprehensive.

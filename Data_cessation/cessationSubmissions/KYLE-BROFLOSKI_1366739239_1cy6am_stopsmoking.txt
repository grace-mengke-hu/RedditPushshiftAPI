12 hours in and I want to throw a tantrum and scream and cry like a 2 year old.

This sucks. I've smoked a pack a day for 8 years. I quit when I was pregnant with my son and started up again after he was born. It was easy to quit then, but it's really really hard this time for some reason.  I don't know what to do with myself so I'm just pacing around the house and absentmindedly picking stuff up and putting it back down somewhere else. This has to be the worst part, right? I feel like a child on the verge of a full blown on the ground, screaming, kicking, and crying tantrum. I feel extremely....unstable? I have a patch on, but I don't think it's working. Maybe it is. I don't know. What can I do to get through the next 12 hours?

10 Days In

Hi everyone, 

I am 10 days free from smoking, but the cravings are still hitting me like a freight train sometimes.  I've been using my Juul to help and it's really beneficial, although I'm afraid I'm only trading one vice for another.  Any cut back tips to provide someone who smoked for 10 years roughly?  I've gone these whole 10 days without picking up a single cigarette, which is better than any attempt of mine thus far.

Day 5 done, but I found out quit zits are a thing?!

I’ve quit before and never had any issues. The last few days I’ve had CLUSTERS of 5-10 zits in the morning with more occurring during the day. 

I’m devastated. I quit for my wedding because I didn’t want to smoke in my gown. 

How do I get these to stop?!

I’ve been washing my face more. Washing my hands before touching my face. I used to work in a kitchen and was constantly in contact with the fryer and never had problems. Even as a teen I never had acne. 

Please help. I’m so disappointed with being given worse side-effects than when I was smoking. 

My wedding is in two months and people have said it’s lasted 7 months.

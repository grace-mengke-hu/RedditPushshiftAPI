I had forgotten I when I quit, just logged on and saw my 1 year was 3 weeks ago.

The last 12 months have been...different.  I quit (not for the first time) and managed to stay off them, just cold turkey and willpower.   Then I got a dog, and began walking her daily, so lost some weight.  I then decided to join a gym, and now have become a gym rat, going 5 days a week, putting on muscle, running and eating healthy.  My fitness lark has really put paid to my smoking habit - I never even think of smoking.

Hello, I am a very athletic dude, trying to quit smoking (again)

I am 23 at the moment, started chain smoking at the age of 14 or 15 (can't exactly remember). And also I have been boxing for many years (started in my early teens as well). 
I tried to quit many times in the last 3 years, and always got to relapse...
Its midnight in my country now, and I feel like running out and buying cigarettes. 
I have really good endurance, and can easily run a 10K (I do it very often) 
I bought a pack of nicotine gum to help with cravings, unfortunately it is not effective. 
Any advice? motivation?

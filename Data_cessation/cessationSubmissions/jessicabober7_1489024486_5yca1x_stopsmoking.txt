I've been using a vape instead / 3rd day quit

I use a vape on a low dose MG and low wattage a couple times a day to get me through cravings. It's been helping me immensely but it makes me feel like I'm not really QUIT, you know? I'm still feeling much better, more energy, lower purse rate, senses are sharper ... all benefits of quitting actual smoke sticks. Has anyone used vape as a replacement? What are your thoughts?

Don't know if this is a good idea.

Hello. I read in a thread about special books suggestion, where someone said about the Allen Carr Easy way one. I always thought that someday i should probably quit smoking, so i  immediately downloaded the audiobook and started listening to it while going for walks. So yesterday, i finished the book and since i returned home i kept a distance from smoking. I didn't smoke for 5-6 hours, but i was really thinking about that last cigarette that the book suggested, but i was torn and couldn't do it. I was really in peace with my self, thought i was really dizzy and sleepy. At the end of the day i light that cigarette, smoked a little and then put it out. Today i woke feeling really tense and high, although i slept only for a few hours. I felt good about my self, although my main reason for doubting my decision is i can't focus to my studies and i really have to. 

So TL;DR I decided to try quitting smoking at the end of my senior year of college and i can't manage my focus on studying. Any suggestions?

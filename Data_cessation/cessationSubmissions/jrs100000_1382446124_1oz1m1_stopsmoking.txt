When does this stop hurting?

I quit 3 weeks, 1 day, and 11 hours ago after smoking a pack a day for 10 years.  The first 3 days were brutal, then things slowly improved day after day up until 2 1/2 weeks.  All of a sudden on day 18 I started having intense cravings all the time and it hasnt let up yet.  They are hitting me as hard as the first few days, last for 1-2 hours each, and strike 3-4 times a day.  I can hardly function like this.  I cant concentrate and I am constantly looking to rip somebodies head off.  I am determined not to give in, but this is really starting to cause problems with my life.

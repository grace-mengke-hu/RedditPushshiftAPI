Day 5 cold turkey

I have smoked for 18 years. So I am on day 5. On day 3 I had 2 cigarettes, I was at a funeral, though I know it's no excuse. I haven't reset my app because I would feel like day 1 and 2 didn't count. But they did!! 
I don't feel like I'm struggling as much as I should.  How many other people are going cold turkey? And how are you all feeling?

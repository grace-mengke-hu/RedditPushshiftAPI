Please help me get past my first three days.

I've tried Alan Carr's book, didn't work, in fact I felt lied to about how great the book was supposed to be.  I don't understand how it could work for anyone.  Tried nicotine gum, not only did I fail, but my habit increased to a pack a day after I went back to cigs (I was using too much gum).  Tried e-cigs, not only did I fail, but my habit increased to 1 and 1/2 packs after I went back to cigs (I was vaping too much because the e-cig never went out).

I hate these fucking things.  Any cigs beyond 2 brands give me headaches for some reason.  They all bother my throat.  They're expensive, they smell, they take up my time, interrupt my activities, and sting my eyes.  I'm really ready to quit.

So, I'd like to know how to get past withdrawal pangs.  How do you sleep while you're experiencing a minimum of 3 withdrawal pangs an hour?  How do you fill up the extra time so you stop thinking about it?  How do you minimize the panic attacks that drive you to the nearest convenience store before you even realize what you're doing?  How do you get past the 72 hour-hump to get to the more manageable side of withdrawal?

If it helps, I've been smoking 15 years and I never did it for social reasons.  I started to self-medicate anxiety (because I'm a retard and convinced myself it helped) and ironically the anxiety involved in withdrawal is what's keeping me smoking. 

I hope someone has some experience that'll help.  Thanks

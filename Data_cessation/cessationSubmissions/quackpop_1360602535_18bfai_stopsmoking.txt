I think I accidentally quit smoking.

I'm 22 and I've smoked for around 6 years. Two weeks ago, I visited a pharmacy and enlisted in a stop smoking programme where I was given free nicotine replacement products. The first week I was given nicotine patches and an inhalator just for when the patch wasn't enough. I only used the inhalator a couple of times during the first week. The second week, I picked up another week's worth of patches. Everything was going according to plan until Saturday.

On Saturday I forgot to put the patch on and went the whole day without any nicotine. I didn't even notice. I tried doing the same on Sunday and again it was fine. Today I had University, which is where I smoked the most, and although there was a lot of temptation (a good number of my friends smoke) I managed to last the day without smoking.

I did notice that I was distracted, not functioning as well as I normally do, with a sort of cloudy mind, but I suppose that's to be expected.

So, that's how I accidentally quit smoking.

**TL;DR Forgot to wear nicotine patch one day and it was fine**

I am slightly worried that maybe the twelve week programme is twelve weeks for a reason. Have I made a mistake in just cutting out all nicotine like this? Is it going to turn into a disaster later?

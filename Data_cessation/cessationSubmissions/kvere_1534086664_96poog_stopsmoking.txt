Camomile tea and bong rips for withdrawal and cravings

Just thought I’d share what got me through some of my more intense cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

I haven’t smoked in 3 weeks and I haven’t looked back. I’m super proud of myself and happy being a non-smoker.

However I still get cravings sometimes, and can get *extremely* stressed over them. I have a lot of anxiety. 

So, I’ve been going easy on the coffee and booze, drinking lots of water, taking deep breaths, pampering myself etc. But for IMMEDIATE RELIEF, I recommend drinking lots of camomile tea and, if you smoke, you know what your limits are and won’t cause yourself anxiety, taking a bong rip or two alongside this is HEAVENLY. 

Even if you don’t need relief from a craving try it out as it’s super relaxing. 

My bf is quitting now, has tried this and found it helped as well. 

Hope this helps someone. :)

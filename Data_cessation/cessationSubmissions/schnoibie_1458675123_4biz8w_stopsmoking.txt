Not smoking around my smoker friends!

Last night was a big step for me! I've been avoiding hanging out with some friends of mine because they're quite heavy smokers. But last night I was able to go over to his house and every time they went out for cigs I didn't even feel the need for one! I was even able to hang out outside with them while they smoked and not even crave!

I'm 9 weeks without any cigs (one puff from a friends eCig, but no cancer sticks) and going strong! You can do it too!!!

I FREAKIN' MADE IT!

I made it the two weeks!



My hubby and I were getting ready for bed last night, and I used to have a "last smoke" before sleeping.  I laid there for a moment, kinda just going through my brain for any craving signs...



Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.



I sat up and told Marco, and he was so happy he gave me a huge hug!  I don't have any nicotine cravings anymore, I don't feel like I want a cigarette!



I HAVE NEVER FELT SO FREEEEEE!

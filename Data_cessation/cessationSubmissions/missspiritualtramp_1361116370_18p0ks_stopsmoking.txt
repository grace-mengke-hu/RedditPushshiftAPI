I messed up.

Well, I slipped up on Friday night.  I'm still off the smokes otherwise, and I'm not resetting my badge because I'm scared it will demotivate me to have to go back to day 1.  It was a stumble, something I should have predicted better and planned for.  Some of you will judge me, but hopefully some can sympathize with my story.  
Some friends were in from out of town, and they party a bit harder than my local friends usually do.  Don't get me wrong they are both incredible people (one in grad school one finishing law school this April), but they party hard and I wondered what would happen to my non-smoking ways if I did any drugs.  When someone offered me a bump I didn't hesitate to do it, and pretty immediately craved a smoke so bad.  I held that off for a while until we hit the bar, and then used the excuse of going to the bank to find someone outside to give me one.  I smoked a total of 4 that night, but managed to stop myself from actually going to the store and buying a pack.  
So, I'm not pissed off or upset with myself, it was a stupid thing to do and I wondered what would happen with the introduction of drugs.  I don't do them often anyway, so now I won't do it at all.  Still dedicated to not smoking, and most of all still going to encourage as many people in this sub as I can to stay quit!
Thanks for listening guys.  
TL;DR cocaine's a hell of a drug

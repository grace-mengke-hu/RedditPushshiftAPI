Qutting tonight

I’m currently chainsmoking my last pack on a long road trip from New York to Alabama where I’ll be seeing my siblings together for the first time in 2 years. I’m the oldest and I don’t want to smoke around them for this week I’ll be there. So I said fuck it, I’ll use this week as an opportunity to stop... for good. It’s gonna be hard, and I expect I will be very moody during my withdrawal around them. Wish me luck guys!

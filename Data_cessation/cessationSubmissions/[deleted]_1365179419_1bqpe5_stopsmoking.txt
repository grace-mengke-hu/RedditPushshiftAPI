Start counting from the last cigarette ever, or from the start of the quitting process?

*Ignore my current badge. I'd set it back when I was going to make a quit attempt that fell through, and it hasn't yet reset as of my posting this*

So a few days ago I just straight up decided I was tired of smoking, feeling unhealthy, and spending a hilarious amount of money on cigarettes. I'm not going 100% cold turkey from day one (I've tried it before and it just never worked out too well). But I've gone from about a pack every day to no more than two cigarettes a day (yesterday I only had one, the day before that I only had two, etc.). Eventually I'm going to maybe have one every few days and then eventually cut it out altogether.

So my question is, do you count for badge and just personal purposes from the day you smoked your last cigarette or the day you began quitting? If it's the day you began the process of quitting it would have been about 5 days ago for me, but if it's the day I have that last cigarette of my life I'm not yet sure when that's going to be exactly.

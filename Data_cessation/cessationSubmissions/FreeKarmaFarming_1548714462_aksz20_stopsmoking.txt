Constant urge for the last 6hrs

My day 5 cold turkey! Had been smoking for 7 yrs on an average of 10-12 cigarettes per day. I've had a really strong, constant urge to smoke for the last 6hrs. I went to the store to get smokes but returned with none. I have tried everything. Delay, drink water, deep breaths, ive tried watching something, been active on this group, spoke to friends and even checked by my stats on smoke free. And I slept for 2hrs in between. It's unbearable. Does this happen to everyone ? Because usually people say it will pass in 15 mins or so but idk what to do right now. 
The worst part is I don't just want to smoke one. I want to smoke a few but just tonight .

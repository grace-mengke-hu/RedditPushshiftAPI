New girl here and would love to have support and support you as well!

Hello:)
My name is Sydney 
I’ve been smoking for 18 years . I’m counting the day when I first touched it but started smoking more when I was 17. I’ve been replacing vaping with cigarettes for over a year now but the last couple months got serious for me . I was really starting to feel the effects of smoking again , also have children that don’t know I smoke but I want to be healthy for them .  I went a month this summer then started coping with pain and stress with cigarettes again . I finally had my last on Saturday and now that the hard cravings have passed I know socially it’s going to be a struggle . I’m really hoping this will help me . Also using the smoke free app which helps a lot .
Thank you if you took the time to read this :)

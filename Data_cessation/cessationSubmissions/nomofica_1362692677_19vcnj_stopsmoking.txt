3rd attempt at quitting; on day 4

I don't normally post things here, but I feel as if I need some sort of support. 

This is my third serious attempt at quitting this habit. The first time I failed miserably. The second time I was successful for 6 or 7 months, and then began the social smoking when drunk. Now I'm on my third (and hopefully final) attempt - as they say, third time's a charm. 

I'm on day 4 today, curbing the cravings with a piece of Nicorette gum every so often (I'm trying to limit the nicotine intake from these, as well). This time around is the absolute hardest and I'm finding it especially difficult to cope. I'm suffering from every withdrawal symptom in the book with some tremors added in. I've identified my habitual smoking patterns (smoking because bored, smoking to pass time while driving). As for oral fixation, I've taken to biting my lips (which really hurts, by the way). 

I haven't begun feeling "clean" yet. My sinus is backed up and I'm coughing up tar. All I think about is lighting up and feeling that hit at the back of the throat. What are ways to try and get my mind off of all of this? 


EDIT: Seriously, thanks guys/gals. Today is much better; the cravings aren't as intense and I'm starting to feel "clean". I have much more energy today and I had a much better sleep last night than I have had in quite some time. I think a lot of it has to do with being able to discuss this with people who can relate. Once again, thank you! :)

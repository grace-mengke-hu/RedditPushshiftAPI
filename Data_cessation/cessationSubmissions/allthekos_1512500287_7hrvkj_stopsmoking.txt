Nothing's working.

I've tried an ecig. Tried cold turkey. Tried Allen Carr. Currently downloading Paul McKennas audio book...im determined to stop by the new year. If I havnt succeeded in 2 weeks I'm going to try champix. Avoided champix as I have mental health problems.

I worry I'm dying from smoking. But as I've done it since the age of 13 and I'm nearly 40 now. 20 a day for over 20 years. I hate it.

Quit 4 weeks ago, still feel like my brain is fuzzy.

I am a long time lurker of this subreddit so I want to start by saying that reading all the posts on here have helped me feel less scared about quitting. I no longer have the mind set that I should put off quitting until after the next big thing is done, because that next big thing will never come. I am in graduate school so it was always "I'll keep smoking until after I am done with these exams".

I quit smoking in earnest 4 weeks ago (3 weeks and 5 days to be exact). I used gum for about a week before I stopped because I didn't like the taste or the way it made my mouth and throat feel. I used to smoke several times a day during work and between classes and ever since I stopped I have felt mentally fatigued. I will be trying to think of answers to a question on homework and in my head its crickets. My brain is like a car that refuses to start and keeps turning over. Even during work I feel slower. I used to feel really sharp mentally, and had a lot of mental stamina, but it feels like its completely gone now.

I do exercise regularly and try to go outside for walks whenever I feel foggy, but it is still hard to concentrate or feel like I am being productive. Does anyone know how long I can expect this brain fog feeling to last? Or if there is anything I can do to keep give me a mental jolt that isn't a cigarette.

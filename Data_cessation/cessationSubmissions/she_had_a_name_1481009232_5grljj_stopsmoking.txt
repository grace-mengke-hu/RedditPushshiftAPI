StopSmoking, is crying during the initial withdrawal a normal thing?

I seem to be overly emotional in the morning hours, whether at home or work I can't seem to control my tears. I "hard quit" on 12/1, no cheats and I'm using patch, gum, and Bupropion. I just can't seem to get a handle on the emotional outbreaks, and  I am feeling at the end of my rope. The tears and crying just come out of nowhere, and it's feeling pretty heavy.
On the bright side, as a former pack a day smoker, I haven't smoked over 100 cigarettes in the last 5 days. I guess I'm looking for encouragement to get me through this tearful time, cuz I'm feeling pretty ridiculous at this point.

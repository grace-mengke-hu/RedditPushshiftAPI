Yeah, the next 12 hours will probably be the hardest for me.

[Continuing on from what I posted earlier this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1hcvsy/ive_been_having_a_huge_craving_for_the_last_week/)

At about 9:25PM where I am and the cravings are getting pretty bad right now as I'm trying to pull an all-nighter to make sure I have enough time to get some extra revision in for my Anatomy + Physiology exam in the morning. But what makes it worse is that I concentrated too much on this exam that I had forgotten about another exam I was meant to do "this" morning. I have already emailed my lecturer in hopes that he will allow me to retake the exam next week during resit week. 

I have already accepted that I will most likely not be able to do that exam so I want to do my absolute best in my A+P one in the morning. And so I am afraid that I might give in and walk to the fuel station down the road and buy some cigarettes. 

This is slowly driving me insane.

Kinda like a /r/nosleep story that pits me against myself and that my subconscious mind will do a lot of things to make my conscious mind self destruct and give in to the cravings. 

I don't want all my efforts to go to waste... I just hope I am strong enough to last until after the exam.

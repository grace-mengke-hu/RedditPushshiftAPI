I Need Help

let me first explain I just discovered this sub literally half an Hour ago as of writing this post 

I should probably give a bit of a back story to my relationship with smoking

you see My father is chain Smoker ,all my uncles(fathers side),My Grandfather,cousins(On my fathers side) and my younger brother are all either casual,Chain or Recovering Smokers 

I Started smoking when i was 18,I don't what it was but it helped me and my depression helped me focus made me head feel calm 

In my early 20 one of my lowest points in life I used to smoke one pack a day right now i have lessened it to an  extent and have tried to give it up completely many times but i always relapse today i smoked for the first time in 2 weeks and  3 days 
 

I Want to give it up completely but i really need help

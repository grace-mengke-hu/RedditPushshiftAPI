Electric cigarettes, thoughts?

Going into my 9th week smoke free i wanted to see what peoples thoughts are on e-cigs. I have maybe used them on and off for 4 years and now, with help of them stopped smoking. I am lowering my dose slowly of nicotine but i wanted to see what other people opinions are on them. I am not going to stop using mine, because at the end of the day, it must be better then smoking right :)

/r/StopSmoking Timeline?

Heyo!

I was wondering if anybody in this community had made a timeline similar to [this excellent post in /r/StopDrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/). Seeing the gradual progression from an addicted physiology to a normal one is very motivational!

If not, I may have to make one myself. In that case, does anyone have good scientific information that they can link?

I'm taking my first vacation as a non-smoker soon.

It just dawned upon me that I'll be smoke-free for two whole months a week before my summer vacation. This is the first vacation I'll have in six years where I don't have to worry about hiding it or sneaking off in the middle of the night and praying that my kids don't smell smoke on me if I happen to wake them up.

Being a closet smoker took a lot of work and caused unnecessary stress. I know that with the absence of the chronic withdrawals I used to encounter ( because I couldn't just take a puff whenever I wanted ), this is going to be one awesome vacation and I haven't looked forward to it like I am right now in many years.

For me, the best part of quitting has been enjoying life in a way I'd forgotten was possible. For those just quitting, you'll hit a rough spot or two here and there but don't forget that it gets easier and easier day by day and it is completely worth the agony you'll go through while quitting.

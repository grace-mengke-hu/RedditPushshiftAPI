Really having trouble quitting

I was a smoker/dipped/chewed/vaped/all of the above for about 2 years. Now I am a week into stopping after my first "relapse". This is so incredibly hard and I want nicotine so bad. I just want to run out to the store and grab a can or grab a pack or get my vape going again. Only for the minute of relief once the nicotine hits. This is so hard... Any tips for trying to calm cravings?

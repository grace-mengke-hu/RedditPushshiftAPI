The best advice I can give based on my experience...

Stop drinking for the first month.

This of course applies to someone like me, who drinks a reasonable amount, but the biggest difficulty I have faced in the past is that half drunk craving that always catches you at the moment of weakest will. Since I quit this time, I am also not drinking and it is the easiest it has ever been.

This probably seems like an obvious point, but it is one worth making nonetheless. By the time I have a drink, I will be one month smoke-free, that sounds like a fighting chance to me!

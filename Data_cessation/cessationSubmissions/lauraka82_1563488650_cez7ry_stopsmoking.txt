Nobody gets it

Soooo...I need to rant just because you all are really the only ones that get it aside from other former smokers. When I was a smoker, people would shame me and make a big deal about how much I needed to quit...”you know, that will kill you”...”that’s not good for you”. My family for example (especially my 10 year old daughter) would whine and cry about me smoking when I would go to have one. DRAMA!! So, I finally quit (day 95) and you would think it would be the opposite...like my family would start cheering for me for every day I walked through the door and didn’t have a cigarette....right?

WRONG! They don’t even bring it up...I will say little things like “day 95 today” when I hit milestones and they are like “good job” and that’s that. All that fuss you used to put up about me smoking and now all I get is a “good job”. 🙄

Luckily, I know the benefits and have been okay with self motivation thus far, but damn! I sure would appreciate someone bringing it up instead of me. Like maybe a “hey, how long has it been now? That’s awesome!!!”

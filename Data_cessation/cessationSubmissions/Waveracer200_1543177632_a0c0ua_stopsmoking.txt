Other vices

What has everyone's experiences been with other vices? I am about to hit month two. However, it seems my desire to drink more caffeine, drink more alcohol, and so forth (aka bad stuff to get a high) has gone up. My mind/myself seems to be looking for another vice. It seems to be a constant battle.  I do go the the gym and get that sort of runners/workout high but no were near like smoking a cig may I say. lol Its different. Any thoughts?

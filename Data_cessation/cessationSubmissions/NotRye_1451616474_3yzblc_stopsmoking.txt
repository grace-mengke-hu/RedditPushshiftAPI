Just want to say thanks to all of you for making 2015 the most important year of my life.

It began as any other year for me - going about my life while addicted to this and that, and not giving a damn.  

In April, I made the latest of many decisions to quit smoking by going on the patch.  But the difference is this time I found this group.  

Y'all helped me to quit for good - I know I'll never smoke again.  And the fact that I have done so has given me the motivation to make even more healthy choices.  I also quit drinking, started eating better in order to lose 20 pounds, and I even gave up caffeine.  

I'm 30 years old and for the first time in 15 years, I'm not dependant on any chemicals.  It's a nice feeling.

Here's to a smoke-free 2016 guys!  

And to the new members - you *can* quit smoking for good.

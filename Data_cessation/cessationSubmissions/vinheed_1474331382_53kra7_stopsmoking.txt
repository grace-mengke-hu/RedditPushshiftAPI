90 days smoke-free

Just here to thank this sub for getting me through the first 3 days which eventually led me to the 90 I have today! There's a lot of good people here and tons of good resources/tips to aid in quitting. Anyone can do it! Smoking has become such a thing of the past now, I can't believe I used to smoke that much. Quitting smoking was the best decision I never wanted to make. 

The 3rd day was the hardest so I took my moms crappy mountain bike out to get my head off the nicotine withdrawals and now cycling has become an avid hobby of mine! I'm also eating healthier and not feeling guilty every time I light that smoke. Oh yeah, and I have more money in my pocket and don't smell like shit. I'm 27 and in my prime!

Just wanted to say thanks.

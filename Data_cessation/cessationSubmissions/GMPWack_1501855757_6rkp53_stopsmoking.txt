Some things I have to remember while I begin my journey to being a non-smoker

1) No one made me start smoking. I could say "peer pressure" or some bullshit like that, but in the end, I chose to put that first cigarette in my mouth, and I can choose not to ever again. 

2) Yeah, withdrawal sucks.....but no one told me to start smoking, so don't direct my frustrations toward people that don't deserve it......

3) People are fucking idiots......I seem to work with most of them, and the rest ride the bus. However, strangling them until they stop being fucking idiots will not solve my problems, but instead create new ones. 

4) Not another puff....no matter what.

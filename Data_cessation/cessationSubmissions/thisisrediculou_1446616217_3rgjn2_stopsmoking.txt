It's been almost 2 years

I quit almost 2 years ago, my husband quit long before that. Over the past few months, I've been fighting the urge to start again, I notice every time someone on tv has one, but I've managed to keep it under control. My husband started a seasonal job recently and everyone there smokes. He bummed 2 of someone and we shared them, then he asked me to buy a pack tonight. I did and smoked one by myself, I feel so sick right now. It's cold in here but I'm hot, I feel on the verge of puking, and I'm hungry but the thought of food is putting me off. Never again.

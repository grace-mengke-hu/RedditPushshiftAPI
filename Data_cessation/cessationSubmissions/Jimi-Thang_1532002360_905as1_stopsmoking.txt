Went to a Bar and Didn't Smoke!

I went to a bar and had a bunch of drinks last night. A few months ago, I would have been hitting my vape and thinking about cigs all night. Last night, I didn't even bring the vape, and I even turned down cigs twice when offered. This was a huge milestone for me! I just made a year, and after last night, it feels real. Like I am actually done with cigs for good. Now, I am working on not using the vape anymore. I have weened down to only using it at work and when drinking, but I think I'm finally ready to put it down for good too.

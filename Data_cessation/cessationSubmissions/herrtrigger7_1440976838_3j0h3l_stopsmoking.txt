What's worked so far (about three weeks in)

I'm gone a little over three weeks without taking a drag. I've quit on and off many, many times over the last five years, but have never made it that long consecutively without at least having a drag of a friend's cigarette. 

I've been using the Smoke Free app, which I really recommend. One of their daily missions is to post what's worked for you to a smoking cessation site, so here I am! Smoke Free has been great because it helped me to channel my urges to smoke into another compulsive behavior (pulling out my phone and hitting the "Craving?" button). The mantra they suggest "Not another puff, no matter what" has helped me in a few situations where I know I would have caved during previous quitting attempts. 

For the most part, my cravings have almost ceased completely, but every once and a while, one will hit me out of the blue, and I think that's the trickiest thing: remaining vigilant and committed when you haven't had a craving in a while. 

A few other things that have helped: having licorice and gum around, putting the money you're saving into a transparent jar every night, and working on deep breathing. 

I'm really happy to have quit. I haven't noticed a lot of health benefits as of yet (I know it was fairly recent), but not smelling like cigarettes, and being able to smell and taste better has been AMAZING. I also take a lot of pride in having made the decision to quit once and for all, and sticking to it. 

Stay strong everyone! I'll do the same!

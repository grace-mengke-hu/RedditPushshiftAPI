Help. Foggy and can't focus after 4 1/2 months.

My inability to focus on anything is really driving me nuts.  I have difficulty doing my job.  I have been feeling extremely foggy in all areas of my life lately and, I am obsessing about cigarettes.  Has anyone else felt this way after 4 months?  How did you cope without smoking?

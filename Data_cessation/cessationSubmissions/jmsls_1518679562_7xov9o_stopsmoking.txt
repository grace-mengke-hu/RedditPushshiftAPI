Day five today

It's been alright so far. Planning to go to therapy and then on to getting some exercise today. Doing all these things without a cigarette feels strange and makes me a bit anxious, but hopefully like at work making it through the activities without smoking shows me first-hand it's not too difficult. Let's do this!

I don't see many music links here, but I think we can all relate to this song (some NSFW language)

I also don't know if there's much love for HipHop here, but I figured at least some people have to enjoy it. Let's get away from that fucking pimp!

Edit: Why do my links keep not showing up? [Atmosphere- The Skinny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHDKyLuE4g)

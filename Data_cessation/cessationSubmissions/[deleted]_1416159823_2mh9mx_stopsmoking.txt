Intense craving after beers

Its been six days since I last smoked and was quite happy about it. This is probably my 9th or 10th quit.

The six days went kinda smoothly, minor cravings which went away in a couple of minutes. I quit cold turkey.

But today changed it all.
I went to the pub with a buddy of mine and both of us shared 3 pitchers. I was worried I'd start smoking cause it had happened before while having beers, but this time I was determined I wouldn't let it happen. And it dint.

On my way back home I get an intense craving and wanted to stop for smokes. But thankfully I did not have any cash on me so I couldn't do anything about it. Now I'm home and still craving for a smoke, and there's nothing I can do about it since no stores are open where I stay.

Today I will sleep it off, but I really worried about how I'm gonna handle it in the future ? Do I have to stop drinking ? If yes, for how long do I have to ? Is there any way I can drink and still continue with my quit ? Is this something I've to deal with forever ?

Ps; I'm not a heavy drinker, on an average I have about 4-5 beers (650ml each). 

I appreciate any help fellow quitters.

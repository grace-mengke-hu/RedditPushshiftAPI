How did you know it was time?

So I've been steadfastly making smoking more inconvenient for myself hoping it will make quitting easier.   My workplace is nonsmoking, I am moving to a place where smoking will be extremely inconvenient and I voted purposely for the extra tax on cigarettes in my state (CA - U.S.).  All of this is for the express purpose of making it easier to quit and I still don't feel like I'm ready.  What was the straw that broke the camel's back for you?  How did you know that this time you were really ready to quit?

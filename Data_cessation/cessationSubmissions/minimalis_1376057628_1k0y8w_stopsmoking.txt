23 days and counting?

It's been 23 days since my last cig. I am partially disappointed.
I was smoking for 5 years and my biggest concern were my energy levels. What I mean by that is I had problems walking up to stairs, swimming, etc. Basically I have to breath fast and deep after like 5-10 minutes of cardio.
(22 yo, 183cm, 67kg, 5-7% bodyfat, I'd say average physique, heart problems(valve) doc says no surgery needed)
So its been 23 days and I've been hitting the pool regularly and I still have the same 'breathing problem', nothing has changed, except I have better taste and smell but that won't really help me achieve better endurance. 

Anyways, what I ment so say is that it turns out that the reason I decided to stop smoking was actually a 'wrong reason'. I couldn't really achieve the thing I wanted and I see no changes. So now I have second thoughts about quitting. Then again I have saved a really nice amount of money so that's the 'new reason' I try to hold onto.

Damn, the first 3 weeks was easier than this one. :/

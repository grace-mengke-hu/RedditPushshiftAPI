Has anyone been to The Mad Russian?

Hi everyone, 

I'm a hopeless smoker. 

For the last year I've been thoughtfully trying to quit smoking, I've made four months, caved, and then a couple of months, a few weeks. But I keep caving over and over again. 

For years I've tried everything

- Allen Carr
- NRT
- Acupuncture
- Therapy
- AA (even though I'm not an alcoholic)
- Homeopathy
- Xanax

You name it, I've tried it. 

I've been reading a lot about The Mad Russian, Yefim Shubentsov. Has anyone gone to him? Does it work?

After four years, I think it's finally time.

Four years may not seem like very long to most of you, but for me, it was. I started smoking when I was a junior in high school, and now I'm a junior in college. It was all I really had to look forward to throughout the day. I remember my first real craving , and it was kindof scary to be honest. I would sit in class and that's all I could think about. That one cigarette between classes is what I lived for. As of today, I'm only two days clean, but I've already noticed a dramatic change in the way my senses work. I've never been excited to smell something before. Today when I was going to class, I got excited because I could smell the oil, gasoline, and rubber in the garage as I went to my car. When I got school, I smelled many different perfumes that I didn't even know existed. I always just thought the building had no smell at all. When I got back home after class I made a sandwich and I realized my sense of taste was reactivated as well. I put everything I on the sandwich I could think of, and for once, I could actually taste it all. This may sound like me just being overdramatic, but this is all it took for me to commit to quitting. I've always told myself I should quit in the past, but could never bring myself to do it. Now, I don't have much of a choice. I was between jobs, and recently I got a new job, but I don't get many hours yet. So, like every other college student, I'm dead broke. I don't have enough money to support this habit anymore, and I've decided to use that as an excuse to finally quit. I've gotten ample positive feedback from my friends, which only helps the quitting process in my mind. Yesterday was rough until I spent a couple hours on this subreddit reading success stories, and quitting tips. I'm so glad this place exists, and I hope it continues to exist to help others quit too.

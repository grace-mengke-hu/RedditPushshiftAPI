Day 1: So far, so good.

I'm fat, have high blood pressure, and don't exercise, yet I decided, in a moment of weakness, to start smoking last year.  I've had a persistent cough the entire time and hate the way I feel.  

I bought a house.  Looking forward to making it nice with the love of my life.  I don't want to die in her arms at 40.  I want to grow old with her.

I decided last night around 1am.  Got up, crushed my remaining pack, and threw it in the bin.  Chucked my lighter over my backyard fence. 

I woke up this morning, driven to keep it up.  Shaved, felt nice.  Clear.  

I didn't have that morning smoke.  I didn't have those two drive-to-work smokes.  I didn't have those three lunchtime smokes.  Now it's time to go home.  I just need to get home safe.  The urge to stop and pick up a pack and lighter on the way home is going to be strong.  

I don't want to die in her arms at 40.

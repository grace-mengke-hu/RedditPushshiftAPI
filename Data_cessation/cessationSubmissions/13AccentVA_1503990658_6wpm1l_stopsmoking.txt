Anti smoking ad trigger?

Is it just me? I've been able to suppress or eliminate most of my smoking triggers, but the more progress I make the more these anti smoking seem to work against me. They have become, by far, my hardest to resist trigger. My other 2 "successful quits" went really well by eliminating triggers one at a time and doing everything I could to reduce stress, but so far from any attempt this has been my biggest issue. Last night I was watching YouTube (one of the best things to zone out and forget to smoke for me) but every ad for about 3 hours straight was one of these, not even different ads, just the same, non-skipable ad, over and over... Watching TV now and came on as I'm typing this! 

Does anyone else have an issue with this, and if so how do you handle it? 

As a note, I understand they are trying to help people not start smoking, but it's just a constant reminder to me that I'm trying to quit when it's best if I can just avoid thinking about smoking at all.

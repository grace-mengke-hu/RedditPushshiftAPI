I want to but..

.. But i'm scared. Does it make sense? I'd rather jump off a plane knowing parachute might not open, than quit smoking. It's like it represents some sort of safe zone to me.. 
On the other hand I'm getting sick of it. Not that it costs more and more, I feel like time could be better spent. If i smoke one and go walk on some random hill I almost die. Like my breathing is broke. Annoying.
 Only what I said at beginning is making me keep smoking. Feels like if I stop.. What do I do then? 
Any good tips how to do it? Crazier it will be, more likely it will work. That I know

Almost 48 hours without smoking, but I'm suffering from insomnia. I'd appreciate advice.

My husband and I both quit smoking. It has taken both of us a ridiculously long time to fall asleep and staying asleep was nearly impossible. We're cranky. We've taken turns attempting to nap, only to lay in bed and find sleep unwilling to come. 

Is it typical for those that quit smoking cigarettes to have to fight with insomnia for a while? Will this side-effect of quitting go away soon? What can we do to encourage our bodies to sleep better without taking sleeping pills?

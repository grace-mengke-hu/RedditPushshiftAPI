This is the time

This is the last time I quit. No one last smoke. No one last drag. I gave the last of my smokes to one still gripped by the addiction and I'm never getting more.

I can't wait to be able to breathe fresh air, truly fresh air. The world will smell better. Food will taste better. I will be better. Hell, sex will be better.

I am sick of stabilising my emotions with a fucking drug. No more. It will no longer have control.

It's time motherfuckers.

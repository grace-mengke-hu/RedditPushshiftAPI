Does anyone else justify their smoking by saying to themselves (or others), “it could be worse”?

Title is self-explanatory, in a sense. I feel sometimes that the shit I’ve been through in my life justifies my smoking. Like hey, some people who’ve been through shit in their lives turn to hard drugs, like heroin. I literally justify my smoking by saying to myself, if I didn’t have this, I’d be an alcoholic, or a worse type of addict. I could be ruining my life and the lives of those around me. At least this is only hurting me. Does anyone else who struggles with quitting here do this? I know it’s a bullshit justification. Just want some opinions on it.

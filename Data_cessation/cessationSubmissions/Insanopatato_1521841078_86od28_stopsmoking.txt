Wanted to share a "poem" I wrote that helped me get through a relapse recently.

Maybe this will strike a chord with someone. Written in a slam poetry type style.

Struggling with addiction is like an unwanted perscription.
You wish it wasn't real like a book of fiction.
You smoke your last cig every day but you lack the ambition.
Quitting is missing and missing is yearning.
Yearning, craving, wanting, lusting...
Something that's known to be life threatening.
But we smokers like to dabble with risk.
That's something that's in the back of our minds after each hit.

I love you

I hate you

I don't want you

But I need you

The only difference is that in this relationship. IT doesn't need you.

IT doesn't need you and you don't need IT.
So to that I say there's no better time than now to quit.
Take a moment and let that sit.
Take your last hit and commit.
You'll soon find the nicotine will submit.

One month cigarette free! It is a constant battle, but you all have inspired me so very much.

Since quitting on September 13th (Friday the 13th, yep what a day!)...


- I have gone from running only 1/2 mile to being able to run 3 miles non-stop! I'm still not a fan of running, but I've noticed significant changes already - in both my body and mind. I am hoping to keep this up, because after this much progress in only one month, I can't imagine where I will be physically after three months!


- My face has cleared up significantly! My skin tone is brighter and looks incredible. Some days, I don't even wear make-up (which is actually a big deal for me)


- I drink LESS. Something about having a smoke and drinking a beer or glass of wine, just went hand-in-hand. Now that I'm not smoking, I don't have those extra couple of beers. And now that I'm not drinking as much, I don't have the mentality of "Screw it, I deserve a cigarette."



So I want to say, Thank you all very much for your own inspirational stories and motivating words. [You rock my world!](http://i.redsnapperverytasty.com/graphics/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bill-murray-youre-awesome-500x648.jpg)

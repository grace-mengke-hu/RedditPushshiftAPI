I discovered a little trick to keep me from smoking

My daughter bought me some Tic Tacs to help with the cigarette cravings, so I pop one in my mouth, get a good fresh taste and them pretend "smoke" through a straw. It helps me cope with missing my methol smokes. Just be careful you don't suck in the tic tac. I keep it in my cheek.

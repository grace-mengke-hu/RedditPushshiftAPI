What did improve for you without smoking? Thrilled to be motivated by your experiences!

Hey there,
I am completly new here and not a native speaker, so please have mercy (:

I am at a point where i know i have to finally stop smoking to get rid of that little voice in my head that warns me about going to regret it if i don't. I tried before but never made it. I read a lot of post here and it is really motivating, but i realised that i always search it through for people explaining how not smoking improved their life. 
I feel like that could be the key motivation for me, to realise how much better my life would be without it. So that is why i am asking you to please share your experiences with me, positive or negative.

Thank you!!

Quit for 2.5 weeks, losing the reasons why I quit.

Im not craving for a cigarette, it doesnt eat at me. But each time I see someone smoking i think: One doesn't hurt, i've quit really easily, so I can do it again easily again.

I can hold my promise to myself even when im drinking, with coffee, after sex and after diner. But the thought still crosses my mind. 

I can tell myself no and im not going to smoke because I have quit. But I just really want to know if these thoughts will ever fade.

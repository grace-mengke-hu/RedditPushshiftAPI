13 hours down. 10 year smoker

Here I go. 

I'm a long time lurker of this sub and I'm finally going to step up and quit. I smoked a pack or more a day, depending on the stress level and I've tried quitting several times with no luck. My fiance is trying to help but it's frustrating me because she's trying to help too much. Is that really a thing?! Too much help? She doesn't smoke so when I try to explain how it feels, the answer I get is " I didn't know that was really a thing ."  How do I help myself to not get mad at such a small thing? Is it normal for my lungs to burn the first day? 

This is the first time I've reached out while quitting. I really hope it sticks this time. 

Thanks for reading

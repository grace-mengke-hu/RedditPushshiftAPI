I've decided to stop today before my addiction gets worse

Hello /r/stopsmoking. I've been smoking for about 3 years, and its slowly making my life miserable. 

I started with hookah and really enjoyed it every once in a while, then it started becoming something I would do almost every day. At that point it still didn't occur to me that it was a problem, I thought I could stop whenever I wanted.

Then I moved to a colder place and I wasn't able to smoke outside too often because of the cold, so I switched to dokha (a type of really strong arabic tobacco) since all it takes is a view seconds to take a hit and thats all you needed. Well long story short, I got addicted. The ammount of tobacco that I smoked per day kept increasing until I realized that I can't function probably without taking 5 hits per day, more if I was under stress. I tried quitting but it didn't work out, the longest I've been without dokha since about a year is 2 days (I know it sucks). But now I've decided to quit it cold turkey, along with every other form of tobacco. I'm posting this because one day I want to look back on this post as the moment I made a change in my life, I want to be like the people I see hee who've been off tobacco for hundreds and thousands of days. 

Thank you for existing, and I hope I do it right this time.

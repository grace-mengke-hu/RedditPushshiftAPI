Any chantex users?

I'm sick to death of these cigarettes. I had to use a rescue inhaler for the first time in 10 years. I just can't bear the idea of not smoking though. It makes me anxious, and I can't afford to get fired for being a witch right now. I just wanna hear if it worked, and about your side effects.

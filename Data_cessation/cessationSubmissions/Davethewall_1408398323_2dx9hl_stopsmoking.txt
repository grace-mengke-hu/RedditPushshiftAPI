Four days strong

Hello everyone, I have decided to stop smoking cold turkey and i stumbled into this sub and i really like it. Looks like alot of great people. Like to introduce myself, My name is Dave, im 21 and been smoking about a pack a day since 16-17. Now being 21 im sick of feeling like crap everyday so last week i decided to quit, now im four days, i know not alot but its some progress. Only thing that sucks is that i get cravings so bad from working all day in the kitchen and sweating my ass off, so i just eat alot to try to stop craving it all the time (or sneak a beer), but i do enjoy looking at this sub and looking at everyone's progress, and hopefully ill be done for good.

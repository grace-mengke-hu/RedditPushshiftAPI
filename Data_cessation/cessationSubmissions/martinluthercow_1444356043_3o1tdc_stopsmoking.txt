Does smoking make me a more patient person, or does is it just an excuse to remove myself from the presence of people I don't like?

On hour 6 without cigarettes, and I'm going crazy (irritated, SUPER ANNOYED and I feel like I want to punch her in the face) listening to my roommate talk. See title above. Anyone else have the same thoughts?

Edit: Haven't fixed my badge yet, but this is day 1.

Quitting when you don't want to

Has anyone here quit when they don't actually want to quit?

For context, I love smoking. It's a hobby for me, and I enjoy it. I like the taste, the smell - I love buying new packets and opening them up, I like stubbing cigarettes out (and in fact feel funny if I don't). I smoke when I walk, when I wait, when I need a break from something, when I'm stressed, when I'm sad, when I'm happy, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner, mid-way through cooking...whenever I can. Still, I'm probably only smoking 10-15 a day-ish.

I mean, I know that's all the addiction talking. But I tend to be pretty focused on my hobbies, and I've smoked now for 8 years without skipping a day.

But I know I ought to quit. I know that. And now my SO has said he'll give up meat if I give up smoking for January. I'm a vegan (yeah, one of those), so that's kind of a huge deal for me. He bought me a vape. The deal is: if I give up cold turkey, he'll go vegan. If I vape, he'll go veggie.

I know I can't do it cold turkey, but maybe the vape will help. But I've always been under the impression that you can't quit until you're ready. Am I wrong? Have any of you quit without being ready/wanting to?

Anything I should do to prepare myself if it possible? I couldn't find any FAQs or guides or anything in the sidebar to help.

Today is my one year without smoking!

It was super hard the first 2 months. I had headaches and cravings and even dreamed about smoking. Around the 6th month is when I finally started to forget about it. I realized that I had to separate myself from some people because them smoking was just to much of a temptation, but now I've reconnected with those friends and no longer feel the urge to smoke. Sometimes you really just have to separate yourself for your won well being. I love reading all the positive support on this page, seriously thanks a ton!

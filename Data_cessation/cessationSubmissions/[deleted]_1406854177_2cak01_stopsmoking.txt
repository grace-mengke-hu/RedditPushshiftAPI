electronic cigarettes / badge system

How do you all feel about using electronic cigarettes to aid in quitting analog cigarettes?  I quit drinking a few days ago and requested a badge from /r/stopdrinking.  Now that I don't drink, I'm tired of smelling like an ashtray.  I've had an e-cig for sometime to help me quit, but I'd run out of refills or get a dead battery and end up buying smokes when I was to drunk to care.  I'm throwing away what's left in my pack tonight before going to bed.  I'm starting back on the e-cig tomorrow to ween myself off of the nicotine over the next few weeks.  I guess my question is, is it okay to request a badge if I'm using an electronic cigarette?  I was thinking of requesting one in the meantime and then resetting it when I kick the e-cig habit.  Any thoughts?

3 years of no smoking, but somehow it's wiggled it's way back in. Smoked for a fews days, got sick, obviously fucking stupid.

You think you're in the clear and won't ever have an interest ever again, but it slowly crept up on me. I bummed a few from a friend while at an open mic night, then a month later I bought my own pack. 

Now, late last week, I bought a new pack, smoked three in a day and I woke up with a god-awful sore throat. Like, barely breathing sore throat. It's better as of this morning, but that just goes to show how terrible smoking is for you. 

I'm out. I'm so fucking out. Greetings from another Day 1.

Quit a month ago and stress got to me. So I light one up today.

And it was nasty it was harsh and I couldn't get past a 2nd puff. I don't see this as much of a set back as something that needed to happen. Proof to myself that this is the right direction in my journey to betterment. 

Just thought I would share with you guys and gals. I wish the best with you and your struggle. 

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.”
― Theodore Roosevelt

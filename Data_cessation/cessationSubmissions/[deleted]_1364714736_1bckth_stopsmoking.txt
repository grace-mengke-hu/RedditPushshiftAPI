how can I help

my SO (m45) has been smoking for over 30 years. recently stopped, lasted 3 mths, and back to smoking again.

what can I do to help him?

I stopped buying cigarettes...even if Im out shopping I make him go and get his smokes. he never smokes in the house, he never did. lights up in the car on long trips only.

he says he would like to stop, but...... tried hypnosis,  gums, patches, tablets,...... 

any other suggestions, please?!

A couple of side-effects I want to talk about.

Hello.

Currently on week one here, 4 days in.

I've noticed some unnerving side effects that may or may not be related, and I want some opinion as to whether this is normal.

Preface: I've been to the doctor twice. They ran a bunch of tests and have confirmed I don't have any serious problems. They could not explain my symptoms. 

Symptom 1: General dizziness/fatigue. I'm feeling foggy, run-down, and tired. Caffeine does not help. 

Symptom 2: Chest feels very tight, almost like I have a lump in my throat. It's hard to take a very deep breath or yawn. I can breathe normally otherwise.

Possible variables: spring allergies are abundant and I've been miserable with several things like nose/ear issues, coughing, sneezing, etc.

Has anyone experienced this at all?

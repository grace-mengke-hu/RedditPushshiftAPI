Anyone else had to quit drinking in order to stick to no smoking?

I am tired of quitting smoking and starting again. Weekend socializing with drinks is a pretty big part of my social life. Unfortunately, this is when I start smoking again. I find it insanely difficult to socializing and/or drink without smoking - nearly impossible. I have basically come to terms with the fact that if I want to quit smoking, Iâ€™ll have to give up drinking for a while as well. This makes things even more difficult because it requires an entire lifestyle change, and having to give up two vices. Any advice or similar experiences??

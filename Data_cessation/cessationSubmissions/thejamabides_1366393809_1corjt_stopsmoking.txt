Tired of constantly being depressed about it...

Everything in my life is good!  Except that I still smoke.  :(  I have used Chantix about 5 times to quit for 2 or 3 months and then I'm right back at it in a moment of weakness.

This time I'm going to attempt to quit cold-turkey.  I need to know that I can do it myself without help.  It's time for something new and permanent.

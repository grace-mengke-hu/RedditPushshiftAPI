Day 1 - Taking advantage of the time my SO is out of town this week to get through the first few days.

I did a bunch of reading online recently, the benefits of not smoking and the risks of smoking. I also caught the "cold turkey" slide post yesterday and checked out the accompanying website which was equally insightful. 

This is the 4th time this year I've tried quitting, and each time I tell myself this is the last time. When it doesn't work out I beat myself up over it. This time I'm not putting as much pressure on myself. I'm also going to avoid any environment that may cause too much stress and desire to smoke.

So no bars for a good month, no concerts, and no large social gatherings. A lot of my friends are smokers and looking back I realize that's where I slipped. I can't hang out with them until I am comfortable with not smoking. Instead I have plenty of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn to play to keep me occupied! :D

I also noticed I was a huge bugger to my boyfriend each time I was quitting. He's out of town for work until next week. This is the perfect time to get all my craziness out of my system before he returns in five days. I'm also looking forward to him telling me how nice I smell and good I taste when he gets back. :) I think it will be a nice surprise for him as well as a great motivator for me.

Thanks for reading and the support!

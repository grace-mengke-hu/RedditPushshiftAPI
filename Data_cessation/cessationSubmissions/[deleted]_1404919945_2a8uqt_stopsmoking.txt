Stress, friends, and cards.

I quit smoking a few days ago and have been doing fine so far. I've made it past a lot of triggers but I feel like my hardest challenge is ahead.

This weekend there are a few big card tournaments in the area and I plan on attending them with friends. My friends smoke, and I used to smoke. I feel the combination of being with friends and the stress of cards could make me light up again.

Any tips on handling stressful situations around smokers?

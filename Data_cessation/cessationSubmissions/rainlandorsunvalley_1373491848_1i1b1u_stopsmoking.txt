Today is my 30 days not smoking. Feels like a milestone.

Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories of support. Every time I smell a cigarette, I either want to cry and buy a pack, or want to throw up because it smells disgusting. I'm moving back to NYC in a month and a half and I just can't smoke cigarettes. I can't afford $13 for a pack of American Spirit Menthols. I can't afford to not be running every day. I can't afford to see another FUCKING photo of a pretty girl smoking a cigarette on tumblr. I hate how those images are all like "ohh smoke a cig and stop eating youll be prettyyyy". Gaaaah, okay this turned into a rant and I'm done. No more cigs. Thank you everybody.

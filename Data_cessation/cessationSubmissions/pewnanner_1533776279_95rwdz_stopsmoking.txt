Day 8 and I’m fucking miserable

I have a BAD lung infection. I’ve got the shivers and shakes. I can’t focus on anything and my skin is crawling. My testicles. My very nuts are in pain for no fucking reason they ache. It feels like there is sand paper in my lungs instead of lungs. 

I’m really regretting this at the moment. 20 year smoker....should have just kept at it is what it feels like at the moment. THE ONLY reason I have to not smoke is my daughters. There is no other reason. I am not doing it for me, that is for sure. And I’m definitely not doing it for anyone else or any other reason like health or what people think of me. Only for them. I’m seriously crying right now fuck this shit.

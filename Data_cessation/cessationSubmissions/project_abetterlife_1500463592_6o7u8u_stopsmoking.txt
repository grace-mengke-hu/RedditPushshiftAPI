More than 200 days free. Need to learn how to handle anxiety or boredom better

Hi!

First the good: more than 200 free days now :) This is good.

Second, asking for advice. 

1) I have been having lots of anxiety "attacks" and do not know how to handle them. I have realized that this was happening in the past already but I used to "handle" it by smoking until I felt physically ill (dizzy or nauseated, did it by chain smoking not giving myself any time to recover) which would distract me from the anxiety. Of course, I never developed good healthy ways to handle this. Now I just try to either power through or curl into a corner or phone a friend when I get really non-functional and cannot handle cooking or eating or going to bed. Suggestions?

2) A less serious but still frustrating problem: What do you do when you are bored but with low energy? Bored with high energy I either exercise or go for a walk or clean. Bored with low energy... I just randomly click on links and stay bored and unhappy. Ideas? I live alone and do not have a pet.

Thanks!

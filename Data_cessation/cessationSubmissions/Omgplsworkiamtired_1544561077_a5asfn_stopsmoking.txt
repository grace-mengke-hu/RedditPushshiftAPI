Gum disease reversed

I quit smoking 10 months ago and I had my annual dentist visit today. I haven’t been to the dentist in two years and I told her I did quit smoking in February. 

Well, my gums didn’t bleed much at all, are a healthy normal color, they stopped receding, and I no longer needed a deep cleaning which was going to be having my mouth numbed and plaque scraped out from under my flapping gums. It has been two years like stated above because I didn’t want to go through all of that. 

But because I quit smoking I no longer needed it and my mouth is healthy. The hygienist even took pictures to show the dentist before she came in because she was excited to see the difference!!!

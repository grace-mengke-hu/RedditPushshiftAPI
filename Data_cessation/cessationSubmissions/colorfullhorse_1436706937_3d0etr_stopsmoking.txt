13 days in and feeling worse

A while ago i decided i will quit smoking for good, after 2 years of smoking about 11 cigs a day i started to feel all the bad effects it had on my lungs and overall health. What i didn't know was the apprerent fact that i was more psychologically addicted to cigarettes than i'd ever be physically. i stopped smoking right when i got on a train to austria, i wisited my aunt there for 8 days.
In austria i was constantly occupied, mountain walking, playing texas holdem with fake chips, ect. ect. i didnt even felt a need to smoke, i had frequent thoughts about smoking but never felt like i NEED to smoke. Now, when im back home, im alone again. I feel horrible sitting in my room with no cigarettes. i started to having episodes of irrational fear, axienty and depression theese last few days. i do my best to occupy my self with anything but i still feel bad most of the times. i told my self that i'll see how i feel in 2 weeks, and if it'll get worse ill start smoking again, im on the verge of going out and buying a pack right now.
Anyone of you fellow non-smokers had theese problems ? 
i apprechate you help, finding this sub-reddit has helped me a bit.

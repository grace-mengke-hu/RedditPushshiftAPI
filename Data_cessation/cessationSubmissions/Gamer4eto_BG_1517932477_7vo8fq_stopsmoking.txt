My mom's "Stop Smoking" story

This isn't my personal experience, but experience that my mom had when she stopped smoking. She was smoking a lot and one day she cought so hard that she vomited from the cigarretes. Then she was disgusted of what  she threw from herself. From that day she promised herself to never smoke again. Now the tricky part comes here. People make a common mistake, the throw away all of their cigarretes and tell themselves - No, i am not gonna smoke. But the way my mom told me she did it is that she always had a couple of cigarretes in her bag to not get nervous and buy instead, and whenever she felt like smoking, she told herself: I am gonna do it later. With a lot of will she stopped smoking. I am 15 and have never smoked ever in my life, because in my case is going to be deadly. Hope I helped you a bit

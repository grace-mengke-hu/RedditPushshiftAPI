Past my one of the hardest test of will yet.

This is the second time I have "quit" smoking. The first time I was about the same amount of time in as I am now and I went to Vegas and smoked a cigar which lead to a cigarette which lead to a pack... I just got back from Vegas didn't smoke. I think it has finally stuck.

24 hrs.

Cranky.  Annoyed.  Depressed.

Keep cycling through these three emotions.  I hit 24 hours at 9:30.  

Bad case of bronchitis and a hyperextended rib made me realize I didn't want my 60s to be what I was feeling throughout that cold the entire time.  I kept smoking throughout all of it, pack a day.

I got put on offbrand Chantix, and it's doing its thing.  Cigs taste gross.  I still wanted to smoke.  I weened myself down to 10 a day for 5 days, and then 5 a day for 5 days.  

It's working, and easier than any time I've tried before.  My skin isn't crawling, but I feel like I'm trapped in a small room with no door.  I still want to smoke, and think about it every five minutes or so.

Needed to rant.  Hope this gets easier.

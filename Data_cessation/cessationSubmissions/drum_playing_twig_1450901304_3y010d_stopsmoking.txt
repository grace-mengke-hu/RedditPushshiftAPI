Beyond stopping smoking

Christmas party last friday. Bunch of party smokers, there. People offering cigarettes. "Hey bro, you wanna go outside real quick and have a smoke?"

Turned everything down, not by sheer will or iron discipline, but because of utter disgust for it. I'm so beyond being a smoker it's not even nostalgical. 

I'm so grateful. Seems like yesterday when this was a struggle.

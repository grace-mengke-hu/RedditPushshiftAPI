So, when am I gonna gain weight?

Quit 30 days ago. My appetite is up and I'm certainly eating more, but I still haven't gain a pound. I'm 122lb, and have always been between 120 and 125 as long as I can remember. My father told me that when he quit cold turkey, he gained 30 pounds after sitting at 130lb the entire time he was smoking. That sounds fantastic, but I'm not seeing anything so far.

Any experience with this, particularly skinny folks?

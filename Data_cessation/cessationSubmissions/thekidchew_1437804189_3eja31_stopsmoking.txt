Advise needed!

Hey everyone! So I've decided to set my quit date for August 1st. The path I'm choosing is good ol cold turkey! Does anyone have advise on what steos I should take in this last week too make my life easier? How about after the 1st? Any tips on STAYING AWAY from these goddamn death sticks? Thank you all for your guidance!

e-cig one month check in.

Third time trying with this subreddit.  I didn't reset my badge until today to try to not make it 'as big of a deal' in my head.  Also, I got an e-cig, which I think still counts.  Tomorrow marks 1 month with no cigarettes.  I feel like the e-cig really helped, if only by making me feel really stupid as I was unpackaging it.  I'm sitting in my room reading instructions on how to charge the stupid thing thinking 'Why am I doing this?  Isn't it kind of ridiculous that you have to go to these lengths?'  I think I was safe from smoking cigarettes at that point.

Problem is, I have gotten a little antsy after not puffing on the e-cig for a few days.  They do still have nicotine in them, and stress from work plus craving still gets to me.  At least it's not a cigarette tho.

Stats from quitNow app:

29 days 12 hours

442 cigarettes not smoked

EDIT:  Shit I think I put the date in wrong on my badge

I'm losing my fucking mind.

I've been smoke free for a little over 5 months now. I've handled everything life has thrown at me and resisted ever single urge. My SO has smoked this entire time and it hasn't bothered me one bit.

In the last week and a half:

* My SO has lost his job

* My SO has scrambled to fix this situation by deciding to move our family to another state for a better job opportunity.

* Had to give my landlord (who is a childhood friend) a 16 day notice we are leaving instead of 30 days. Which I feel is reasonable considering he hasn't fixed my air conditioning since the beginning of last August and has gotten my water shut off on me repeatedly for the last two and a half years (which violates our lease), not to mention all the other fucking problems I've put up with here. We paid last month's rent when we first moved in, and he wants more money out of us since we gave a short notice.

* My landlord didn't pay my water bill for the last three months, and when the city came to shut off my water and I called him about it he hung up on me and I was forced to pay it.

* I've been trying to sell my car and my washer and dryer and everyone keeps assuring me they'll buy them only to back out at the last minute and I really fucking need this money and to not drag this shit with me into the little ass apartment I'm moving into.

I'm not craving a cigarette. I'm on the verge of a fucking mental breakdown and my brain keeps telling me it will help settle my nerves. I miss smoking, I really liked smoking, it was therapeutic in a way. Even though I hate cigarettes I just really want to fucking smoke and I'm going absolutely crazy and I can't handle this shit anymore. I'm so close to grabbing my SO's pack and chain-smoking them until I throw up and I don't give a shit anymore.

This just came bursting out of me. I'm sorry. I know this isn't r/rants. God someone help me or give me a fucking break.

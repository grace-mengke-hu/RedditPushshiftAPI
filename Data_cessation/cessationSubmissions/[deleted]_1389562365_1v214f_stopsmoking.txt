Day 0: Getting my life back on track

I've now had enough of cigarettes ruining my life. Started smoking about 6 years ago, as a 16 year old. At the time I was very outgoing, confident and sporty. I was in the development team for a premiership rugby club here in England, as well as my school putting me forward as a potential Cambridge uni applicant (very rare for my school).

Soon after discovering cigarettes, I found my motivation disappearing. Stopped going to training, stopped doing work, and subsequently I was dropped from the rugby team and my grades were well below what I needed. I didn't really care though, all I wanted to do was sneak out of the house for a cigarette (parents very anti-smoking). 

Fast forward to fifteen months ago, my last quit attempt. Motivation came back, joined the rowing team at university and competed, confidence returned, grades improved. Everything was looking up and I managed three months, until I went home for the Christmas break, where I found myself in the smoking area of the pub, lighting up again.

Not this time. University days are now behind me and I've started my career. I need my motivation to come back, and I know cigarettes will only hinder that. Sorry if I sound conceited, but I'm feeling really up for this challenge, and I have just put out my last cigarette. Wish me luck, and good luck to all you other quitters! We can do this!

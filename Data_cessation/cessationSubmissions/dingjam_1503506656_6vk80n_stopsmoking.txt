First Day

After 10 years of smoking. Finally decided to stop it. Gave my remaining pack to a friend to destroy. Today is the first morning and mornings are the worst. But I have decided to go cold turkey and that's how it will be. I'm using chewing gum and deep breathing when I get cravings. I guess the first 5 days are going to be really really rough. But nothing is impossible in life.

Just wanted to say that all you folks trying to quit, you are doing absolutely the best thing. Stay strong Stay healthy.

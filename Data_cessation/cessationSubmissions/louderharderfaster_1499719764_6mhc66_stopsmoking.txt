Day 40 and I can breathe again!

I can't tell you how many things I put off as a smoker. 'I have to quit smoking first' became a central theme in my life. I've taken up quite a few activities since I quit 40 days ago but this morning I woke up and took the first deep breath I have had in YEARS. I felt the air *move* all the way to the very bottom of my lungs and *not* get "snagged" on gunk.  

I am still using the gum but have cut my intake in half over the past week so I am hoping to be totally free by August 1st.

I've had a dozen smoking dreams this past week and they are now nightmares. I wake up so relieved I did not actually smoke that I could cry. I really, truly, finally know that I can trust myself again -  I will not smoke again. 

Taking that breath this morning felt like life itself!

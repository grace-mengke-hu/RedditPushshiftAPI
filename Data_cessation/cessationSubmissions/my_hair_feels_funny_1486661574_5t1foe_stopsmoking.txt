Question about quitting and odor

So this may seem to be a stupid question ... but how long after do you quit do you smell good? Like does the odor cling to you for days or weeks? I ask because the last time I quit my SO kept telling me he could still smell it even when it had been many days since I had smoked. I am almost ready to quit again, and this wont stop me, but it'd be nice to know I smell good right away.

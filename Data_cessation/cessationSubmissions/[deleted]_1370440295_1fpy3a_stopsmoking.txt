After 6 years of stupidity, I've decided it's finally time to quit

I was the idiot who bought his first pack of smokes at midnight on my 19th birthday, the minute I legally could. I'm 25 now and have decided I've let this ~~habit~~ addiction go on for far too long. I smoked my last cigarette around 3PM this past Monday and already I'm feeling more confident and motivated.   
I don't know why I'm posting this, other than to act as a bookmark of sorts for my quit date, and maybe inspire some other just-starting-quitters. Go us!

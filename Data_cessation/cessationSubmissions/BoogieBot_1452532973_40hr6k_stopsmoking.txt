Missed my 3 year anniversary

1/5/2016 was my third year smoke-free, cig-free, tobacco-free, nicotine-free. Yesterday was my 1100th day of freedom. 

How did I do it? I borrowed a page from AA, and I quit one day at a time. Every morning, I made a promise not to smoke that day. I just had to get through the day. And if I faltered, I would have to start building willpower (and days) all over again. 

So I didn't smoke on 1/5/2013, or 1/6/2013, or any day after that.

I'll probably unsub later this afternoon, as I don't feel like I need this sub anymore. I quit, and it's over, and I don't _want_ to smoke anymore. I'll come back if I need you guys, but right now...

...I'm free.

Feeling super guilty and ashamed of myself.

So I’ve made it 6 days without a cigarette. The first 2 days of my quit I used an e-cig sparingly, but decided to give that up too. I went 72 hours without a cigarette or e-cig, no nicotine of any kind, until just now. 
I woke up in a bad mood, got into work for the beginning of a 12 hour shift, and just broke down. 
I took three hits from the e-cig, and I feel like I’ve ruined the progress I’ve made.
Not really sure why I’m posting this, I just need to vent and get it out.
On the plus side, it has still been 6 whole days without an actual cigarette.

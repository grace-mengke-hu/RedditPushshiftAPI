That felt so good!

Hello ex-smokers and soon to be ex-smokers! 

I am reflecting on a really drunk night yesterday in my hungover state. Though i feel like crap right now i just recollected an interaction yesterday which is heart-warming. 

I was at my usual pub yesterday for St. Paddy's after almost 3 weeks of not drinking(for my diet). I was a bit skeptical before i started drinking yesterday as i got a weird craving while buying beer yesterday. The checkout counter had cigarettes and i had a flashback on how i never bought anything without a pack of cigarettes. I remember how i used to tap the pack on my wrists before opening it, how i peeled the inner lining and how it always felt good to break open a new pack and get that 1st cigarette out. It was sudden and strange craving after a long long time. 

So long story short me and my friends joined a group in the pub's patio and had a good time. This lady sitting right next to me pulled out her cigarette pack and offered me one. I declined it saying i just stopped smoking after 10 years of habitual smoking. I usually don't explain that to people and just decline so they don't feel bad abt smoking and kill their vibe. But i was super drunk yesterday. 

But reflecting on this small conversation feels so good today. I declined a smoke when i was drunk out of my mind. It's really good to know that I'm a non-smoker on my sub-conscious level. Keep going at it guys. We are making a huge difference in our lives here. Small things like these are totally worth it!! 

Thanks for reading. I'm really hungover while typing this. So excuse any mistakes in writing.

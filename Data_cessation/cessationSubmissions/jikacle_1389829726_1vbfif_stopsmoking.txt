Dear gods quitting sucks.

Okay, it **doesn't** suck. Sure feels like it though.

I'm either sad as all fuck, or if someone - anyone - comes around I start to get angry with them for no good reason.

Worse, I can't hold my focus on much of anything, doubly so due to AD**H**D and not having a stimulant constantly anymore.

Anyways, thanks for reading my bitching. I can't write anymore because my mind drifts off anytime I try to start think of anything of value to put down.

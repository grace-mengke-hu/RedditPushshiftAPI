Keep going guys

What up beautiful people,

Just want to drop a line to encourage all of you on your quests for emancipation from this bullshit habit we've all chosen for ourselves. I've personally tried twice this year and failed, once went 2 months, 2nd time 3 months, gearing up for another attempt in the new year. I know your struggles for they are mine, too, and each of you who's working to better yourselves day by day (or minute by minute when it gets really rough), is an inspiration. You should all be proud of yourselves.

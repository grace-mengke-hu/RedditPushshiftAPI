1363 days ago

1363 days ago I woke up and told myself **today** was the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

That morning I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2yep77/the_day_has_come/) on /r/stopsmoking, a pledge to stop smoking once for all; little did I know how much it would really impact my life for the better. I recall reading threads on here about people who managed to make it a week, a day, a month, six months, etc without smoking and I remember thinking "there's no way I can do this" -- it was scary. 

&amp;#x200B;

The journey was [not easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/30kqqo/cigarettes_smell_amazing/), in fact, it was [very challenging](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/316qsl/scared/) at first. I managed to [make it to 30 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/325dje/30_days/) and that was a big milestone for me. I knew that every second I didn't smoke, my chances of never smoking again were increasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

45 days in I was hit with a wave of depression and [found myself googling reasons to smoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/33g181/nearly_45_days_in_major_depression/) trying to justify smoking again but alas, I pushed on and before I knew it I was posting my [60 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/35bm81/60_days_on_holidays_going_strong/) smoke-free thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Time flew and I found myself at it for 6 months, posting my [6-month thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3kjda2/6_months_all_thanks_to_you_guys/) and then my [1-year thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/49ka0s/one_year_all_thanks_to_this_sub/). My situation nearly took a bit of a turn at around [day 412](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4gbgob/412_days_and_still_some_days_i_feel_like_having_a/) but I kept going. I continued telling myself this was too much hard work to throw down the drain all to satisfy one craving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quitting smoking was a catalyst in my life; a spark for even greater things. I quit smoking, lost a lot of weight and excelled socially and educationally.

If you're someone who has just quit smoking and you're reading this, I want you to know that anything is possible; great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance. Take it slowly, take it one hour, one day, one week at a time and before you know it you'll be looking at the success you've cultivated for yourself.

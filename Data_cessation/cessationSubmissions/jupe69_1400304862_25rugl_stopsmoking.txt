16 years heavy smoker

So, i suddenly take the decision to quit. Been smoking for 16 years now 2-3 packs per day, never tried to quit before. I discuss it with my doctor and she suggests i start taking champix. First week, i take the pills along with smoking. I am looking forward for the second week when i quit, mostly because i want to see if i can make it, if i am able to resist something that everyone's been telling how hard it is. The day comes and i quit cold. Today is just my second day but i don't really crave it at all. I am in a great mood and determined to never smoke again whatever happens. I don't know how this is possible, but it's going much easier for me than i expected. Seems like it really is 99% psychological. 
Bottom line: My ego worked pretty well as method to quit. Take it as a challenge and know that you are better than this.

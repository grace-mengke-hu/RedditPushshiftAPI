Day 1

Few packs per day heavy smoker for 20 years and finally my body gave up. I simply cannot do the overnight gaming and work next day anymore. 

Went to the doctor and got champix at the drugstore.

I tried to quit smoking. Probably every smokers tried to quit more than 100 times in their life. Same here. But finally I'm feeling that my body is failing a bit. So I decided to quit. I gave my cigs and lighter to the doc since I knew I'd smoke if there is cig in my pocket. Doc gladly tossed those to the trash bin.

Thanks to the national Quit smoking program, qualified doctor consultation and drugs are fully tax deductible. 

Though it was about 11600 Korean won (About 10$) in total.

17 years in, thinking of quiting...

My wife recently bought me a box of the nicotine patches, I've tried them in the past and they worked great during the day. However if I wore them at night I'd get terrible dreams. Really vivid stuff. Anyone else experience this or have tips to help with nighttime cravings?

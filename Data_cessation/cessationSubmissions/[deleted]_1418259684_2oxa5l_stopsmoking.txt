Instead of telling yourself you want to quit for good this time, commit to being ready to do whatever it takes to quit.

I saw this quote on /r/leaves recently and it rang true for me. It makes quitting smoking less about hoping that this is the time it sticks and more about taking responsibility for doing *whatever I have to* in order to just NOT SMOKE.

It brings home how important the little moments are - figuring out whatever you need to do to get through every urge to smoke (whether that's running around the block, leaving a party, watching a video on the effects of smoking, coming to this sub, or whatever).

Hope this small shift in perspective helps some other folks, too.

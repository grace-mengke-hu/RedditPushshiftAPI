40 yr smoker terrified of Chantix/Champix

Quit in 2000 with Zyban. Failed after 9 months and caused my husband to fail as well. Deep depression, hospitalization, homicidal dreams, blah, blah...I’ve been on citalopram 15 yrs., works well for me.

I’m determined to quit smoking before the end of the year. I don’t think this drug is for me. 

Help! F(56)

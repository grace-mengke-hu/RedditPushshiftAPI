Decided 5 hours ago I'm seriously quitting. Have a patch on...this is going to hard as hell. In fact, I want one now!

My significant other doesn't know I smoke as often as I do but has been urging me to quit for a while now. I want to quit for him and myself.  He travels a lot for work so it's hard to keep myself from smoking when he's gone. 

It's been 6 hours now and I'm wearing a patch (which sadly doesn't feel like it's helping).

any tips or advice would be great! 

This is hard!

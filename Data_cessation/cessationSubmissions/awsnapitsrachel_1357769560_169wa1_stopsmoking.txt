Since I've quit smoking, I'm completely exhausted all the time. Help?

I quit smoking on the 1st, but I was weaning myself off of cigarettes for a week and a half prior. I should also note I'm taking Chantix. I rejoined the gym, and mentally I WANT to be in the pool or at the gym, but physically I'm so drained all the time. All I do in my free time currently is lay in bed or sleep. I feel utterly and completely exhausted. Any reasons why? I'd really appreciate suggestions on what I can do to get past this so I can get my lazy butt to the gym.

Thanks guys!

Quit smoking 8 days ago, thank you bronchitis!

Hello! Happy to be here (well crabby as hell but, you know :) I quit on 2016-01-15 thanks to having a severe case of bronchitis. After the fourth day, when the bronchitis starting improving, I decided I'd already been through the hardest part (ok, self-deluded) and have been carrying on ever since.
Off to watch some zombie apocolypse movie now...

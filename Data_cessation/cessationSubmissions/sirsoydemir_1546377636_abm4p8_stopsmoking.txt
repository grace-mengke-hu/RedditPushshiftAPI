Day #31 Month #1 done!

First of all thank you all, the veterans, the newcomers, the pokemon guy. This subreddit really helped. I want to talk about give a difficulty/time scale about my first month.

&amp;#x200B;

**First week:**

First 3 days: really hard.

Day 4: okayish hard.

Day 5: DUDE! Toughest day.

Rest of the first week was okayish hard.

**Second week:**

Cravings are easy to deal with, I actually had fun when I beat a craving, was like a competitive game to me.

**Third week:**

Total of 2 or 3 hard cravings. But I said to myself I survived that Day #5, I can survive this, and I did.

**Fourth week:**

It was the easiest, first time I never thought about a cigarette for a day. + Fourth week had new years in it with plenty of alcohol, again, was easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I smoked 3/4 pack a day for 9 years, and I feel really free now. Again thanks everyone, we got this.

Bring it on Month #2 and 2019!

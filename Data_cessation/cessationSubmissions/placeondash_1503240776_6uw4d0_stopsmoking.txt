I'm about to celebrate 10 years smoke free

I just want you guys to know it's not impossible, and it does get easier. When I quit, I had been smoking for more than half of my life. I couldn't think of any memories of myself without a cigarette. I stopped getting bronchitis almost immediately after quitting, which was a nice reprieve from the 2x/year I'd been having. Taking a deep breath is incredibly satisfying now, like drinking ice cold water (or beer) on a hot day. I even stopped dreaming about smoking a few years ago too. 

For my five year anniversary I set a goal to run a 5k and ended up running a half marathon. This year, I'm asking people I know to donate in any multiple of 10 to a local organization that gets kids into a running program to help them deal with stress. (Not soliciting here, though if anyone is interested in donating I will gladly PM a link!) 

Stick with it!
Edit: When I say "about to" celebrate, I mean this week. The day is Aug 24, but I like to celebrate all week long.

It's time I joined you.

I have been lurking around this subreddit for some time now, always reading others stories about how they are quitting, and how they have gone X amount of days without a cigarette, but now it's my turn.

A buddy of mine from work has been holding onto my pack since we started work this morning. I went 8 hours without a cigarette before I bummed one from someone else at work. This may not seem like a big deal, and might sound like I failed to some, but to me it is a huge accomplishment. As this is the longest I have gone without a cigarette while being awake that I can remember since I started smoking 7 years ago. 

I have only smoked 4 cigarettes in the last 24 hours. I normally smoke a pack a day. So this is a great accomplishment for me.

This means I have the will power to quit. and I honestly didn't think I did. 

My goal today was to smoke 1 when I woke up, 1 when I got out of work, and 1 before I went to bed. But I really want that to be my last one. 

Ill take any advice, but this post was mostly just a starting point for me to look back on.

TY stopsmoking for giving me the motivation I need to get started.

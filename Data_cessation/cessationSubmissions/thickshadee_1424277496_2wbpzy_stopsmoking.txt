Acne breakout. Think its related to smoking?

Hey everyone. I was a long time smoker up until the beginning of this year (17 yrs), and things are going great. However, over the last week or two I've been cursed with some really large and painful acne around my mouth and chin. I find it hard to believe this isn't related to quitting, as none of my other daily habits have changed, and I'm sure hormones are coming into play. I don't particularly take care of my skin to begin with, but I haven't had zits this bad since I was 16! HALP!

Did you have symptoms like this when you quit? How were you able to mitigate it?

Thanks for your support. And to those of you just beginning, YOU CAN DO IT!

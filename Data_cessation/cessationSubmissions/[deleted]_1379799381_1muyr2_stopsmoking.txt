Quitting on monday. Got rid of booze 5 weeks ago, xanax 1 week ago.

Hi, reading and posting to /r/stopdrinking really helped quitting the booze.
I've managed to be sober for 5 weeks now, not one drink.
Quit my xanax a week ago, those have been strange days, am still feeling withdrawal effects (at least I think so...)

Now it's time to cut out the cigarettes.
Going on monday with nicotine gum until wednesday - that will be patch day and then cold turkey on thursday.

Wish me luck.

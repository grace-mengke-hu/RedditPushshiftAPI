Day 18

Smoked solidly for 20 + years, numerous quit attemps. Lost a dear family member to lung cancer.

- I stopped Jan 2nd, using NRT(Patch). 
- Using Cessation Nation to track progress.
- Was able to go to a bar last night, drink, sit around smokers, and not want or need a cig.
- I could get used to this.

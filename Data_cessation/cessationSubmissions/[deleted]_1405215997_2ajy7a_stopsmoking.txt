I just realised I haven't smoked a cigarette in just over a year.

It is possible, guys! I always thought I'd be a smoker all my life. I smoked daily from around 15/16 up until I was 19 and one day decided to quit. It's been over a year now and I've never looked back. I have a lot more money than I used to have, not that it really means much at this age, but still. I also realised that I've escaped the clutches of an incredibly harmful drug at such a young age, whilst also having first hand knowledge of dealing with a chemical addiction. I couldn't be happier right now. I know this post might seem like I'm bragging, which I kinda am, but it's also for you quitters to be able to look at and be given that extra push. Good luck guys!

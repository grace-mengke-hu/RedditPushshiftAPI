I've barely started, and I want to quit

I started smoking right before I turned 18, near the end of July. 

I was a varsity cross country and track runner, I played sports all day, I loved being active. Since the day I smoked my first cigarette, I haven't played any sports. I havent ran more than 20 feet. Running used to be the most important thing in the world to me, now it's insignificant. 

Smoking has killed most of my relatives. Luckily my parents quit when I was young. I was influenced by my friends and I though it was something I wanted to have as part of my image.

I smoked my last one several hours ago, before I knew I wanted to quit. Before it was even and idea to quit. They're in my backpack now, and It's going to be hard to not light up in the morning like I normally do.

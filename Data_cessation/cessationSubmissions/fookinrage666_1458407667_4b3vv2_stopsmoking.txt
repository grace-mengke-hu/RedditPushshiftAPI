30 days/1 Month

I made it to 30 days/1 month. I didn't think I would last that long, but I did it. This is the longest I haven't smoked since I started!

Still get cravings but not too often and they are rather weak. Now most times when I think about smoking or cigarettes I don't even crave them (which seemed impossible just 1-2 weeks ago lol). I can be around smokers smoking and not crave or feel jealous. I have come such a long way!

I think what greatly helped me was having small goals. I didn't quit forever, I just quit for a day everyday. I didn't expect to last a whole month, but everyday I knew I would last that specific day.

Only 30 days later I have started to feel like a nonsmoker - I experience moments of being happy about not smoking more often than moment when I miss smoking or crave. 30 days ago it felt like I will always miss smoking, that I won't be able to enjoy life without cigarettes. It's mind blowing to me to see now how much I was tricked by addiction, how it makes you perceive the opposite of truth as true. 

What helps me most with cravings is to know that at this point cigarette won't satisfy me. If I smoke it will make me feel sick, both physically and mentally, so there is no reason to smoke. I don't feel the need to prove to myself like some other people (it's addiction tricking you to have another one). I have tried to quit enough times to know smoking isn't enjoyable anymore if you haven't smoked in a week (in my case at least).

Being on the other side now I feel like idiot for not quitting sooner. I always thought I would feel worse as a nonsmoker, but the opposite is true. I wish I knew that sooner!

After quitting for 4 yrs., I started again last week, trying to kick it fast

So I was medium smoker for 5 years, managed to quit, smoking about 15 cigs. over the first year in a half (5 every 6 months) and **0** for 2.5 years.  I've been going through crazy stress and got a pack and have been smoking like a chimney for a couple days.  I went and got some nicoderm patches (which I haven't used before) and can hopefully get under control fast.  Moral of the story:  abstaining doesn't mean you aren't still an addict, nicotine is POWERFUL shit.

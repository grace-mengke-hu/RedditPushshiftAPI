Day 5 Report! Still fighting it but I'm winning!

My badge is messed up and it should say 5 days, thanks bot lol :) Alrighty, I am sooooooo proud of myself to have made it this far. I have been to both of the hookah bars and chilled with all my friends who smoke and haven't even really had any cravings.... Until last night. My best friend just left for boot camp and it bummed me out hard. Ever since last night I have been non stop thinking about cigs. I guess it's normal. Also, I've been experiencing epic headaches, light headedness, shaky hands and just overall feeling kinda cruddy, but feeling awesome at the same time. lol I did break down and smoke a non-tobacco hookah the other night. I don't feel bad about it because it was really just flavored water. Anyways, thanks for reading and I love you guys for helping me quit. You da besssstt!

Had a scare today..

Was at work today and suddenly felt crazy pain in the lungs (chest area), got very dizzy, started sweating and had a hard time breathing for like 30 minutes. This happened 2 minutes after I had smoked a cigarette. I went straight to the emergency room where I waited for almost 5 hours while they did tests on my heart and lungs.

I'm only 25 y/o, and the whole time I was waiting I just thought "Shit it's gonna be bad news I just know it"

Thankfully, the doctor came with the results and told me that she was surprised how healthy my lungs are after smoking 1-2 packs a day for 10 years. 

But even though there were no bad news TODAY, it was a wake up call and now I'm done with smoking. I don't wanna go back there in 10/20/30 years to receive bad news that day.

How does /r/stopsmoking feel about the Ugly Truth commercials and Facebook page?

This is my first time posting anything to this subreddit, but I have been lurking here for a long time. My first thing to say is that all of you seem like amazing people, and I am planning on showing my mom this subreddit within the next couple weeks, hoping it will help her quit.

But, on to my main point. I see the Ugly Truth commercials all of the time - the ones with the cat pee and dog poop, or the ones with the apparent racist comments by tobacco companies. I'll put my opinions in the comment section, but I want to know what you guys think, since you guys all have obviously seen the dangers of smoking and have quit. 

Edit: Apparently I don't know how to spell "dangers" without switching letters around.

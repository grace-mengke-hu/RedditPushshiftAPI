Girlfriend not being supportive

So I decided to quit smoking a few days ago, I bought a vape and decided to see how it goes (I've been smoking a pack-a-day for about 7 years.) The only issue is that my girlfriend, who I live with, isn't being very supportive of my actions and seems to be framing my choice around how it makes her feel and how it has an impact on her life and has implied that it would be easier for her if I didn't quit smoking right now. I still want to quit but I'm not sure how to reconcile my choice with her feelings. I don't know if I should try to talk to her and let her know how her reactions are affecting me, or should I just not bring it up and try to quit anyway without her support or what! 
Thoughts?
 
TL;DR How to quit when not being supported by long term partner!

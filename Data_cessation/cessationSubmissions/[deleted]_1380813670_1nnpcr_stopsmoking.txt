DAE have a spouse that smokes that lives with them?

I quit cold turkey on Sunday and am having my most cravings when she goes out for a smoke, any advice on how combat this? I love the woman so breaking up isn't an option. I do notice she is trying to do it as little as possible though, and she washes her hands/ brushes her teeth after she goes.

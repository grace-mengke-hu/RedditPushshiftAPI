How many of you had to stop temporarily but decided to quit altogether?

by temporarily I meant like maybe you had surgery, or were sick and couldn't smoke, and then you decided it was as good a time as any to just let it go.

I have tonsillitis, bronchitis, and a sinus infection right now, finding it difficult to go outside and have a smoke, because the 2 times I have tried it in the last 6 days it's been horrible. I might use this opportunity to give up the little devils. 

what are your experiences with quitting in this manner? did it make it seem easier? harder?

even though I have been sick I have been craving going out and having a smoke, mainly after each meal

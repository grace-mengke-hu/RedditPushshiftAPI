Coughing it up in the morning

Im a few months without smoking. Ive begun running again and things are much better. But Im still coughing a lot in the morning bringing up shit. I can feel it come up and I spit it out. its gross. 

I know this is expected, but I kinda thought I'd be done with this phase of it by now. Is it normal for it to last this long? Should I expect it to last much longer?

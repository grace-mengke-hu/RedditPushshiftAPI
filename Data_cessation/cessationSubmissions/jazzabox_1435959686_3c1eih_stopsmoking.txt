The video that made me decide to start the process of giving up smoking.

I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRL7o2kPqw0) the other day, and for once a message about smoking got through to me. Currently on day four at the moment and I thought the act of sharing my trigger may help others.

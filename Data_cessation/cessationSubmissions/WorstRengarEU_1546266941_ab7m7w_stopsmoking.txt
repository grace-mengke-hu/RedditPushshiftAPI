This is hard.e

NY eve in 9 hours.
I am alone at my place which is probably how I am going to spend the rest of today. Family in another country. Friends are occupied with their relatives. That's what I got for being career-focused past two years. Fuck it.

Downed a couple of whiskey glasses and its so hard to not binge. The only thing that keeps me from running into the last store for a pack is me knowing that it will only make me feel shittier and image of me resetting that 2 week counter on my phone.

Stay strong ya'll, it'll get fucking better, I know it. 
Any Happy New Year!

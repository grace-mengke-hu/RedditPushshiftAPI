Smoked for a bit less than one year...

I recently turned 18 and have smoked for coming on one year in total.
I smoke on average about 5 cigarettes a day, but more on weekends or nights out. 
I have gone about a day without a cigarette a couple of times recently. I felt moderate cravings but what seems to be no real withdrawal symptoms. 
I want to quit now before my habit gets worse so i'm wondering how difficult smoking will be to quit now? Am i even properly addicted? 
Cheers.

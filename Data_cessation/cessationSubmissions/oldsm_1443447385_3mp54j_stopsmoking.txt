Hopeless about future

I am 22 years old. I quit cold turkey one month ago.I have been smoking for two years around 15 cigarette a day. But I am still depressed. Misses the moments I used to enjoy. I also has lost hope for the future as my plans were different while I used to smoke.All of my friends still smokes. So I do not talk to them much.It makes me feel lonely. Is it normal to take so long to overcome my feeling of depression. I have been sleeping a lot also. That makes the thing worse. I am exercising daily however not enthusiastically but forcefully. I talked to my psychiatrist and he told me it is ok. He did not show much concern about my condition. Does that mean it is quite normal or what?? Because to me , it still seems too hard. I feel guilty for what i have done to myself. What should I do? I can't even tell to my parents what I am facing.

Three weeks smoke free and new to reddit.

Hey everyone! I've never used reddit before, I just signed up a few moments ago,  the quit app I downloaded directed me here and after lurking awhile I have found myself back often as reading the posts helps me anytime I feel the urge, or strengthens my resolve when I'm feeling good (which is most of the time now!) so u thought I would
Finally participate and maybe help cheer on others.  Can someone explain to my why badges aren't visible on the reddit app I downloaded? Anyhow haha
  
 I had thought about quitting many times over the past 15 years as a smoker but never really made a more than half hearted attempt until 3 weeks ago and sort of on a whim. I had been thinking how much I despised what smoking was doing to my body (as a formal military man the state of
My fitness was making me depressed)  and sort of in my head decided that after that pack I wouldn't buy anymore. And I haven't. Went cold turkey. I threw out all of my lighters, I avoided normal smoking spots the first week, and have replaced that urge with jogging or push-ups etc when that is an option, if not I do some deep breathing. I have found that gets easier everyday and the urges have become more like a passing thought. 
    I have gone out to my favorite bar (which is smoking) on the past two weekends and had no problem not smoking. The smell and act of it actually disgusted me to be honest.  I realize it's only been three weeks but I am very proud of myself, and hope to continue to ride the wave of success.

  I do some how often have a dream a few nights a week I end up smoking at a party or something and wake up very upset, and of course a wave of relief comes over me when I realize it's just a dream, and ends up making me realize re disappoint I would feel if I relapsed would be way worse than the perceived joy a cigarette could possible give me!  Thanks for listening!

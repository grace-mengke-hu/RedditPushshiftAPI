15 days! OMG! I never thought I would come that far ever!!

But still not proud of myself. I can't believe it I think I'm going to fuck it up anytime even if I don't want it! Friday night I was begging my husband for let me go to buy cigarettes and at the end I went to bed and woke up on Saturday much better than if I had smoked. I'm having trouble sleeping and still have this horrible cough. Normal stuff? Anxiety levels have dropped a bit. Pls pls let me know things will get better soon! I'm on holiday soon and the relaxing drinking bit scares me lots!!!! Haven't faced the having a wine in a terrace yet... We can do this! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

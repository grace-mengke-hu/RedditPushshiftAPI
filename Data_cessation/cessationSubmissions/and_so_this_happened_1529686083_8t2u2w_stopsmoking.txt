I forgot I didn’t smoke.

So today I was running late for work (but stopped for coffee anyway because it’s my birthday) but they coffee shop is on the same side of the building where I used to have my cigarettes. So when I get in the building I have this feeling of dread and think, “Oh shit. I have to get on this crowded elevator smelling like smoke and being embarrassed”, but then I remembered I quit and I was late because of coffee, not cigarettes, and I laughed. And it felt good.

4 Months and having a rough time

Been quit about 4-6 months depending on how you count and still thinking of caving pretty much everyday. Yeah its certainly got easier to manage, but as the time ticks on I forgot more and more why I made the decision to quit. 

The thing is for these past 5 months I've been extremely anti social, I go to school and have made it to a handful of social events. I constantly think about the summer days and nights spent smoking weed, cigs, drinking beer and getting loose. These days I have a glass of wine maybe with my parents and I don't even enjoy it, I notice how it makes me dehydrated and gives me a headache. I know and can feel that I'm way healthier, but I just don't enjoy kicking back anymore. 

I still just want to cut loose, but it just seems so lame without having a smoke. I also keep bouncing around the idea of getting a cigar or ecigarette from the store or going to a hookah bar, or even picking up some nicotineless ecig liquid. My brain just keeps bouncing these ideas around, like I need to smoke something, have even been considering tea leaves.

I'm all sorts of fucked up, I think to myself why I'm doing what I'm doing and its alright and come here when I'm really bad. And post when I'm really really bad, so whatta do? The thought of hanging out with friends and not smoking sucks and not hanging out to avoid triggers sucks even more. Whats worse is alot of them would occasionally bum off me, so I've got this idea that maybe I can do that - even though I can already taste how disgusting that idea is.

... Thanks for reading. 

Edit:
Whats even more pathetic is I've had a cold lately and its made me reminisce of my old smoking days. The mind is funny huh.

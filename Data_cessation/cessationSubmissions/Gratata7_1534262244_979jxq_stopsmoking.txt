Day 1 complete. Looking for advice.

Ok so I’m not addicted to cigarettes, but I am addicted to a juul. This is a vape device that has the same amount of nicotine as a cigarette. I realized that it’s expensive as hell and it’s taking over my life. I told my girlfriend multiple times that I would quit and I tried but failed, then lied and told her I did quit. I put my relationship with her on the line and as soon as I realized how much I had hurt her it was the final straw. I can’t let nicotine control me anymore. Last night was hell because it had been about 12 hours since my last time. I feel somewhat better this morning at about 24 hours in. Do you guys have any advice on how to keep going? Advice on dealing with withdrawal? I really wanna beat my addiction for myself and for her.

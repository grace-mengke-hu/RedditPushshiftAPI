30 days in. I'm very close to relapsing!

Hey guys,

I quit smoking 30 days ago and I feel the urge to go back to smoking. I'm quitting smoking and doing /r/nofap at the same time but I relapsed and have been binging on PMO for 10 days now because I can't smoke (overcompensating). I learned that I can't quit both at the same time and I need to stop jacking off to porn but I also don't want to ruin my 30 day smoke-free streak, especially that I know that I'm going to feel like shit again. I need some motivation guys. I don't want to go back to that shit but the urge is too strong.

It's Been 10 Years

And I. Am. Over. It 

I just had 2 teeth pulled.  I'm not supposed to smoke for 72 hours.  I lasted a day.  I am ashamed of this addiction.  I've got the patches, I've downloaded an app, and I am ready for this struggle.  I've been losing weight and getting a new lease on life.  Now it's time to add to that lease.  I know what's coming.  I've quit before when I was younger but it never stuck because my willpower wasn't what it is now.  

Thanks for reading.  Any tips are very much welcome.  I uave never tried a support system when I quit before, hopefully you guys can help keep me accountable.

After a pack a day for 24 years, I’ve now stopped for 24 days. Feeling good, remaining vigilant.

One thing that struck me this morning was the ‘Life regained’ stats. I took 10 minutes out to really think about this. Even the 6 days regained so far has meaning, but imagine what I can do with the extra 8-10 years if I stay off the cigs. That’s a lot of time to enjoy life, spend with family and explore the world. It’s easy to ignore these things when you’re a smoker, but there’s no escaping the reality and the consequences of the decisions we make every day. #NTAP

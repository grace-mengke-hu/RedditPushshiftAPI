E-cigs are a godsend

If you can not quit but want too. I suggest these. I have relapsed and quit and relapsed and now I am on the e cigs. I don't smell bad, my lungs don't hurt, it gives me something to do with my hands. I can go outside and enjoy some peace. All the things I liked about smoking only now when i am drinking I don't have to go outside to smoke.

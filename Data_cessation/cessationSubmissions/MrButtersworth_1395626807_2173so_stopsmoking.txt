cravings are killing me

Just moved and used it as an excuse to stop smoking. Went from a pack a day for 10 years to cold turkey 4 days ago. I had a cig this afternoon while at a sporting event with friends and I can't get my mind off it. All I have been thinking about for the last hour is running down to the store and buying a pack. 

I know its stupid. I know I can resist it, but damnit if I can't get my mind off smoking. I keep trying to rationalize it... Just smoke one and give the rest to my buddy, or try to taper off a little instead of just quitting so abruptly. Fuck. I don't go to bed for another hour and I doubt I can hold on until then.

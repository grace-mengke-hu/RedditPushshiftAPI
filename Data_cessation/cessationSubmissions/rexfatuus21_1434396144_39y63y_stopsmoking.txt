2 Weeks, Wild Cravings, Smoking Nightmares, Alan Carr, the Rage Quit.

So I've tried quitting a bunch of times in the past and always went back.  The longest I ever went was about 2 months.  I recently decided to try reading "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking", and, while I don't know what this sub's opinion on the Easy Way is, it REALLY helped me. 

 I honestly just got disgusted with myself for still doing this stupid, stupid thing (14 years) that I started doing when I was essentially a child (13) and just.... stopped.  Honestly, hasn't been that bad after the initial three days of rage.  I will say, though, that I was out on a friends boat yesterday and was OH MAN DO I WANNA SMOKE.  

Had none last night but woke up from a dream last night that was just me outside smoking and drinking a beer (yikes).  I woke up and felt awful because I was really convinced that I blew it and had smoked a cigarette. It took me until almost the morning to realize that I had not.  

Figure I would share, so far - pretty easy.  Last night, Smoking nightmare, now bored and at work and really, really craving! Oh well.  

Thanks fer the support folks!

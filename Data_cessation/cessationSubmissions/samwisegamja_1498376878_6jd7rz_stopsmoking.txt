Yesterday was my 11th day of quitting. My old-time buddy who I used to chainsmoke with came by for a chat.

FYI my previous attempt failed when I went to an outing with him and others. Bars, drinks, music, you know the rest.

I think I secretly wanted him, or any smoker for that matter, to offer me a cigarette so I wouldnt be too guilty about taking a day off from quitting which was taking a toll on my anxiety. I know, there is no such thing as breaks and it's a deathtrap waiting to suck you in again.

Anyhow, I chatted with him for about two hours. He sat on the other side of the table, with his pack by his cup of coffee, and went through about 10. Me? 0. Granted, I had some help from my vape. 

What threw me off however, was how foul the smell was. I couldn't believe that I used to breathe in that smell everytime I walked by a smoker in the first few days of quitting because I wanted it so badly. After we said goodbye, I had to change into new clothes as I was getting disgusted and nauseated from the stench; and that was only from being near a smoker. The thought of smoking a cigarette disappeared as my brain linked it with the smell. 

I know that there is still a lifelong journey ahead of me. However, yesterday was when I started to believe that this attempt may be my final one. The biggest change in variable from my last try is this subreddit. Coming here and reading a lot of the posts gives me a feeling that I am not alone in this struggle. Thank you for your existence. Hopefully this post, as personal as it is, can help a person remember why smoking sucks.

Third time. Goddamnit, I say this so often lately but... this is going down. I am done with smoking.

I just spent an hour reading all of your posts and it inspired me to give quitting another shot. 
I'm having one last smoke. And then that's it. Done. Done. 

Any great ideas for distraction? I'm gonna do pushups.

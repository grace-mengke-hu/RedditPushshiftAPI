Joined the 4 month club. Need some advice.

I've gone back to vaping.  0mg Nicotine, but still.  I had a craving the other night that very nearly made me pull in to a gas station just to buy smokes.  When do they stop?  Also, I didn't feel all that unhealthy before I quit, but I wanted to stop smoking.  Now I'm having a raft of health issues and I'm just trying to understand why.  When I was smoking I could swim or run or exercise without getting winded.  Now, not only do I lose my breath easily, it takes forever to get it back.  I've also had to use my rescue asthma inhaler more than before.  I've packed on a quit a few pounds since February, but because of all these aches and pains exercise has been elusive for me.  Has anyone else had issues like this?

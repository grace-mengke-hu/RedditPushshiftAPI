Day 5

Decided Sunday after 16 years of smoking it was time to quit I smoked on average 15 a day and slot more when I drank. Today is Day 5 smoke free and besides having a short fuse it's been good I found just trying to stay busy was the best way for the first three days and now I'm just drinking water when I get cravings . I think once I'm through this weekend I'm done no going back I've also found just saying to people I don't smoke is fun hope these little tips help someone else

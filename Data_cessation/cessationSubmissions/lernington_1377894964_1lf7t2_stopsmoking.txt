Heartbreak at the 3 Week Mark

Today is my 3 week anniversary since I quit smoking, and my girlfriend just broke up with me about an hour ago.  I'm completely devastated and heartbroken right now.  Even though I did it, and am sticking with it for myself, she was my primary support system, and it's really taking everything I have not to go to the gas station right now and pick up a pack.  I could really use a pep talk.  Please help me stay strong.  If I fail, the sense of defeat will be even greater now.

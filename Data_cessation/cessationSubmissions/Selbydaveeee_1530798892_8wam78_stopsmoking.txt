Hmmm... calm before the storm?

I’ve just past four days and not sure why but I haven’t felt like smoking at all. I’ve also quit booze, going to the gym heaps and being very disciplined with eating. 
I figure stuff it, I’m doing (ie quitting) everything at once which might be a good idea or a bad one I’m not really sure yet. Maybe it’s best to quit one thing at a time but at this stage it seems to be working so why stop now right? 
Has anyone else had experience with quitting a lot of things at once and if so did it work?

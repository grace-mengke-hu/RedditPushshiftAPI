Day 3 - Nearly out of the woods?

So I'm a few hours into day 3 and I feel pretty good so far. Yesterday was AWFUL. I very nearly caved... we had a small amount of money lent to us by my SO's mum and had some left over once we'd stocked up on food for the rest of the week. My eyes were glued to that wall behind the counter that they keep the tobacco behind. I am so glad they implemented that barrier because honestly it was a huge factor in me not giving in. I couldn't see the actual tobacco so it helped to quell the craving a little.

I ended up managing to rip my eyes away by fixating on chocolate as a money sink for what we had left and I just grabbed the first thing on the shelf, paid for it and almost ran out of the shop. I've never felt so much like a slave in my life - I came on this subreddit and just read constantly on my way home to remind myself why I'm doing this, so thank you everyone. 2 days down, still no cigarettes.

I also called my mum because we haven't talked in a few days and that helped beyond belief, I didn't even think about it while I was talking to her (she doesn't know I smoke so I certainly can't talk about quitting to her, which means I'm not dwelling on it while I talk to her). Good luck everyone, you can do it! Distraction is key - keep something motivational or distracting with you for those moments when you're slipping.

Edit: I didn't want to spam the sub with another new post but I just had a massive sign I'm making progress here. Someone walked past our open office door and a strong whiff of tobacco followed them. IT DIDN'T MAKE ME WANT ONE! I know it's early days but I'm amazed, it actually made me feel queasy.

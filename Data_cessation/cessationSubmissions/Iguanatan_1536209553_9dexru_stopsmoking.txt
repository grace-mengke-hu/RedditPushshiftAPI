I missed my 200 day smoke-free-iversary!

Just thought I would have a casual peek at my tracker, and it showed 202 days (in Australia, so ahead of the 201 counter on here) and I was shocked as it was 160 or so last time I checked. 

Truly, everything is much easier as a non smoker. Since I stopped the habit,  my Dad, a smoker since 15, has been diagnosed with COPD. Whilst I am acutely aware the damage could already be done in my case, I am still thankful I have the chance to allow my body to heal. 

If you are here reading, know you can do it. Know it is worth it, and know YOU are worth it.

Starting fresh, it's good to chat with others who can relate!

I was pretty much smoking 3/4 of a pack per day for quite some time. Last September I got started on e-cigarettes and I was immediately able to quit. I went 7 months and made the mistake of having a few smokes after some beers with the guys. A few weeks later and I was back into this filthy habit. This time the e-cig isn't really doing it for me and I want to try to quit for good without it. During the week it's not TOO hard, except my co-worker smokes constantly and I have to watch him go outside all the time. I can manage that though. The real trouble is weekends (well, alcohol mostly). Does anyone else find it really hard to avoid smoking while drinking?

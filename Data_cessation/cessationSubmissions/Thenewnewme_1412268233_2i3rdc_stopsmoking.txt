I'm back! Today was supposed to be day one, guess it will be tomorrow.

Well, I was around here a few months ago with a different account. I quit cold turkey after about 10 years of smoking. I made it to 12 days before I had a 'bad' day at work and I smoked a crushed cigarette that I had seen a few days before between my car seats. The next day, I stopped at the store on my way to work, bought a pack..and was instantly back to my pack a day habit.

There were a few more tries in between there, I lasted 4 days once, then 1 day...then 6 hours. Every time I try I make it less and less far as I did the first time.

I keep trying to do what I did that first time because it worked for a little bit at least. I smoke my last cigarette before bed the night before, reset my QuitNow app, and go for it. But it isn't working anymore. 

I never used the vape method before. So today I went to the store before work and instead of a pack of cigs I bought one of those disposable vapes. I figured I'd just use that for today, then do the cold turkey thing again tomorrow. I had already given up and I was only awake for an hour.

But it was awful, I don't like how it tastes...and certainly don't like how it  'hits'. So I bum a cigarette off a coworker. Then another, next thing I know I'm running to the store to get a real pack. Now it's lunch time and I've probably smoked 7 or 8 cigs.

I ordered Allen Carr's book...it should be coming today...my hopes on that 'working' aren't very high but neither was my hopes on the vape working...I just know I have to try something different this time. My small success of the 12 days isn't going to happen again as easily as it did the first time I guess. 

Well, I just wanted to get that out. I'll be around again, you guys helped me so much the first try so I know I'll need it again..

See ya'll around!

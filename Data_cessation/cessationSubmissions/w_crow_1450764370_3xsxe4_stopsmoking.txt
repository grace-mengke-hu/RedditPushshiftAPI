Hey all, Solstice Sauna Changing My Outlook.

Hey all, just need to get this out.  


When I'm cooking in a tiny hot room and swimming for my life shortly afterward in a pond...I realize how important my breathing is.  How important it is to be alive.  


I'm sacrificing that breath of life for something just to feel "cool" or moderated at work. I relapsed and am choking myself out. I scrapped my badge. It's bad, it feels like I'm a guinea pig running around my cage to nip on my nicotine water bottle....Just so I can feel some "control" through a hectic workday or reward myself after doing house chores.  


What a pathetic way to move through my day. To pay actual hard-earned money, for the pleasure of looking at my skin tone greying in the mirror or feeling my fingers cramping up in a cold December wind.  I don't even smoke full cigs anymore, I nip the tip, feel like I want to barf.  I throw it away and 90 mins later do the same damn thing. 


It's killing me.  Thank you for holding space for me.

Had a slip up

I’ve only been a sub in this place for a couple weeks. Just wanted to vent. 

Tonight or I guess yesterday was my birthday and I relapsed. I relapsed hard and currently I’m smoking a cig. Before this I went almost 5 days with out one. No one around me knows how hard this is. They almost all smoke weed (which I don’t) so they think it’s comparable. 

I’m just feeling real down cause I went back in what I told myself I wouldn’t do. This is the hardest thing I’ve get done.  I’ve quit weed, fighting, many things. This is so intense. 

I have crazy dreams, like very vivid and violent dreams. Anyway I’m just mad at myself because I thought I was stronger than this. No need to respond I just needed to type this. This sub is awesome and you guys helped me.

Does anyone else notice that they don't like certain tastes anymore?

I am a coffee drinker and I also like my Coke Zero.  The last few days, my coffee hasn't tasted as good to me, and neither has the diet soda I like.  It tastes more bland.  Other tastes seem more vibrant, but those two aren't.  I bought a different brand coffee yesterday, and today it was slightly better to me, but I've been drinking that same coffee for a long time and have always liked it.  As for the diet soda, it would probably be best for me to just cut that out anyway, so I'll be making more iced tea from now on instead of soda.  I've seen quite a few comments in this sub with people talking about how great things tasted after they quit, and overall I've had the same experience, but I was wondering if anyone else has stopped liking a certain taste after quitting smoking.

90 days! Thank you r/stopsmoking! What worked for me...

So I had made a serious attempt to stop smoking back in February after 6 years of smoking. I had several relapses despite using this subreddit frequently and reading Allen Carr's book. Finally, near the end of June I was reading a post here where OP was asking what he should do about feeling down in the dumps, or slightly depressed. I had felt the same way each time I had tried to stop, and combining that with the craving is what ultimately had me lighting up again.


One of the comments to the post was pretty simple:
**No pain, no gain**


Something just clicked. I had to accept that quitting was going to suck. There wasn't an easy way around it. (Not to discredit anything from Allen Carr's book--it was helpful but it didn't click like that saying did)


Every time I'd have a craving, or start to feel bummed, I'd just repeat **no pain, no gain** to myself. Push through the suck. The days kept adding up, and it just got *easier*.


There were also a few other things I did that I feel really helped:

* **Sugar free gum**-the Wrigley Dessert Delights helped me a lot.

* **Exercise**- I joined a Crossfit gym which made me NEVER want to smoke again. I can't imagine smoking and keeping up with some of the workouts there. It also got rid of my craving anxiety, and made me feel good all around.

* **Put the money you would spend on smokes toward something else**- I used to spend close to $180 a month on cigarettes. I now put most of that towards Crossfit. Even if I wanted to pick up smoking again, I couldn't, because there is no room in the budget for it!

* **Snacking**- I know this probably isn't the best but it did help me quite a bit. I kept bags of broccoli and other veggies on hand and would just pop them to try to calm a craving. 

I didn't gain any weight. I am not still tormented by my cravings. Once in awhile I'll get a slight mental craving, but it's nothing I can't push out of my head. I really hope with the help of r/stopsmoking and the methods I've been using I can stay smoke free another 90 days!

Thanks so much!!!

Went for a run yesterday

Before I started smoking, I used to be really into running. About 3 years ago, I could clock 10k in about 45mins. Then thanks to my stint in the army, I didn't have time to run regularly, and on top of that I picked up smoking. Since then, I really haven't been able to run properly. Yesterday though, on my 3rd day of not having smoked, I decided to run.

It took me 40 mins to run 5k. 40 MINS!??!???!?? Dammit those cigarettes fucked me up. I'm aiming to get back to my 10k in 45 mins target by Aug.

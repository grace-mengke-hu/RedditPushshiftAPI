Week 2. Almost caved today. Cue induced cravings ftw

Oi. Not a good day. I’ve been sick all week which may have taken my mind away from cravings. However, today I got back to work (work from home filming and such) and wow. Just...Wow. 

The amount of cue induced cravings I had almost had me in tears. I film and do editing at home. My routine is: do my make up, smoke. Film a video, smoke. Set up for another video, film, and smoke. 

I also live stream which I haven’t been able to do all week due to being sick and I always smoke before and after.

I was in such a terrible mood (and foggy headed too.. I may also have PMS going on) from how bad my cue induced cravings were that I cried and really thought about having one. May need to break out the hot sauce. 

This sucks.

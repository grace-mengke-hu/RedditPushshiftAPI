The smells are overwhelming and its getting to me...

I fell sick with viral fever last week and was bed ridden completely - I've been wanting to quit for a while and  I took that as a opportunity to quit smoking - its been going OK so far - most of the withdrawal symptoms happened when i was still sick and so I could not get up to go for a smoke  (I never smoked inside the house) ...I've been smoking 3-4 cigs a day for last 17 years and its been tough ride last 2 weeks. 

Anyways..the problem is my sense of smell returned this week and life has been hell since then - I never realized my room stank (so bad!) - my bed and bed sheets smell disgusting - I sprayed some air freshener - it was good for 2 mins and now that too is over powering . I hate the smell of my soap and handwash - never realized it till now though i have been using the same brand for years. I commute to office in public transport and I dread the assault on my nose every morning and evening. I want to puke when the guy eats his lunch at his desk 3 rows over and i have to smell stale garlic for next 2 hours. The list goes on.....

I know lot of folks are so happy to get their sense of smell back but for me this has been a torture..anyone else feel this way when the quit ?  Any ideas on how to get over this ?

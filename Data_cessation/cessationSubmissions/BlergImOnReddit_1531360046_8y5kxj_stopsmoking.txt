Life doesn’t get easier, but not smoking does.

My position was eliminated last month. There’s some severance, so I’m not totally fucked, but...it burns. I’m angry. All the questions about self worth. I’ve thought several times about bumming a smoke from people lighting up on the street. What keeps me from doing it is realizing tomorrow might be even worse...but I still don’t want to be a smoker, so I better not give in to the temptation now.

6 month’s and counting, and all I can say is that it really does get easier. Keep with it, friends. Better days are ahead.

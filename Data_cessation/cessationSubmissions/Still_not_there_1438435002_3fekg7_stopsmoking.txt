Cigarette free for five years! Today I celebrate that I no longer have an increased risk of stroke!

Just wanted to share me being proud of this achievement. Hang in there all of you. There will come a day where you no longer is just avoiding cigarettes - there will come a day where you don't even think about avoiding cigarettes.

4th Day, No Moles

Hey guys, I'm in a bit of a different situation, but I still could use the support! I started smoking weed about 10 years ago and it eventually led into taking moles/mokes/chops/poppers. This is when you squeeze out about a puff of tobacco and put it in the bottom of the bowl, then cover it with herb. It has been about 3 years since I started this nasty habit and originally it was to save money. I was in college, and mixing bowls 70/30 saved me a ton of money. Fast forward and I graduated and have a well paying job that makes it completely unnecessary to do this anymore. I have never smoked a cigarette, but would finish those light blue bags of tobacco once a month just from bong rips. I know it sounds stupid, and it is, but I have to stop. It has been 4 days since I packed a "moke" and I feel so much better. I'm starting to get my appetite back, not sweating in the middle of the night and feel like I can actually breathe in the morning. I don't have the urge to smoke a cigarette, but just to take a huge rip and melt into my couch haha. Bong rips don't have that "pop" anymore, but I want to be able to enjoy my weed again. I'm quitting with my girlfriend which has made things a bit easier, but I still get triggered when arriving home from work, waking up and after eating. I'm sorry if talking about weed triggers some of you, I just felt that I had to get this off my chest. Has anyone ever experienced anything or known anyone who has experienced anything similar?

Withdrawal.

So I'm riding close to 6 days now without a cigarette and at one point I've never felt better. I'm proud of myself for making it this far and not lying to or cheating myself. 0 nicotine for 5 whole days now, wow! However, on the other hand, I feel like complete and utter shit. My mind races, my palms and pits sweat, I get small but very noticeable pains in my chest which leads the anxiety in me to scream out "oh god it's a heart attack I know it!", and I feel like I'm cooped up. I stepped outside for fresh air but couldn't stay because it was so cold and windy. 

I'm also getting the high-like feeling of increased oxygen levels now that I've stopped and my body's in the repair process. But all of this is normal right? I've always heard about withdrawal symptoms but thought it was just an exaggeration. It's so much worse than I imagined but I'm determined to keep on fighting.

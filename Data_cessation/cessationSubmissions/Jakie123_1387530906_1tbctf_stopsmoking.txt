Relapsed after 6 days

I quit cold turkey a week ago from a 2 year pack a day habit. In the past few months I cut that back to 1-2 packs per week.

I could deal with the cravings the first few days. The stress and frustration I felt gave me motivation to fight off any urges to smoke. But yesterday night was different. I bought a pack when I went home and smoked two cigarettes. Not because I felt I needed nicotine, like I did in the first few days, but because I thought it would be relaxing and that one or two cigarettes wouldn't matter. I wonder how you people deal or dealt with these soft craving situations because I feel guilty now of screwing up my week long effort.

Early Days - HEADACHES!!

Ok so I'm on day 4 of quitting I was a smoker for 11 years. I have cravings thought the door which I tell myself aren't real and ignore them they will go away - what I can't ignore is the constant headaches how long do they last as they are driving me crazy and I feel like having a cig to see if it gets rid HELP!!!

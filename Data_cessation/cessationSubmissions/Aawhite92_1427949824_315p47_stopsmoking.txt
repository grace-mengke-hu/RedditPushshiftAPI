Day 7.. my first attempt at quitting

I decided to quit smoking last week. I have been using the patches. I am happy and proud to say that I have not smoked a cigarette in a week. I really never thought I could quit and not mess up and disappoint myself. I kept putting it off. I was so scared of TRYING. but now, every day that passes it's a tad bit easier. And the more days without smoking I go, the more I tell myself it's not worth starting all over again. I made a promise to my Poppy, who died almost 2 years ago and had lung cancer several times along with emphyzema, that I would quit in his honor. I am now upholding my promise to him.

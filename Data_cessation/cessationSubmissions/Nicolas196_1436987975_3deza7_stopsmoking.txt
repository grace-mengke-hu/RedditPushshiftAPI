Allen Carr is a beast.

I was never smokefree even one day since I started smoking like 4 years ago. My Ex-Girlfriend wanted me to stop and I just couldn't.
Now !!I!! wanted it and that's the key, like Allen Carr has written in his book. I'm now at the end of day 2 and I have never been so happy. The happieness of breathing better, smelling better and killing that little demon overtake the cravings. Man I can't even wait for demon to be completely dead. The arguments in the book and the will !!I!! created myself helped me. Really if you want to quit PLEASE read the book it is just soo good.

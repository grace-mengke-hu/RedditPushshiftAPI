Almost 2 months!

I can't believe how amazing I feel. The feeling of health and getting better is indescribable. I'm an asthmatic and have been smoking for around 7 years. During the last few months before I quit I was having to use my inhaler 4 times a day (the recommended usage is three times a month). Now I only use it when I'm exercising - and I've managed to start exercising! Light exercise used to be so difficult for me. I cant believe I'm not even 22 and my body was so sick. Thanks to this group for the inspo and tips and congrats to all of us!

I think I'm finally going crazy

It's only been 10 days. I've tried to quit before, each time my agitation got the best of me almost as soon as I stopped. This time, however, the first few days were almost easy. I downloaded an app, marveled in how many cigarettes I wasn't smoking. I even went outside with my SO and sat with him each time he smoked, happily resisting each time. It was going to be so easy this time around, finally!

But around day 7, I went to work and everyone was getting on my last nerve. Day 8, stayed in bed for hours until I had to get ready for work. Day 9, everything my SO does or says makes me want to scream. Now I'm like, "Ah ha, there it is, that familiar feeling that comes right before I start up again." IT'S ONLY DAY 10! While that might mean 50 cigarettes not smoked, I still feel so weak. 

I'm still not going to cave. I just hate putting my relationships under such stress. I also hate feeling like I should just stay in bed for the next six months or so because everything else is terrible. Perhaps my issues are deeper than just cigarettes. I don't know what I'm getting at here, I just needed to vent I guess.

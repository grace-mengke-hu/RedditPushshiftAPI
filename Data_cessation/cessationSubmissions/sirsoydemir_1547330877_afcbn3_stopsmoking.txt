Day #42 I came back from a reunion

Two of the best friends from college came back to town for the weekend and we went to one of our friends house. Now there were 6 of us today and we all smoked in college. Now? Only I donâ€™t smoke. Apparently it is like a gas chamber when 5 people smokes at the same time. I thought I was going to choke. Anyways two beers and 6 hours with smoker friends but, NOT. A. SINGLE. URGE. I am proud of myself. 

If you really want to quit, it is easy. Your brain and you can achieve anything!

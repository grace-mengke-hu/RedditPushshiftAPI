One day with the patch and I've quit?

Pack a day smoker here for about 8 years, decided to quit so I got some 21mg patches since I heard that was the best method (never tried to quit before). I put on the patch and thought it was pretty cool how I had no desire to smoke, whatever. Felt good not smoking.

I wake up the next morning and decide that instead of putting on a new patch like the instructions say, I'll just wait until I have cravings and then put one on. A few hours go by and I haven't had any cravings so I figure the nicotine from the old patch was still in my system, but it's been a few days now and I feel fine.

I was expecting a super rough time, and I'm kind of worried there is some delay or something and it will hit me in a day or two. I had all intentions of spending like 2 months tapering down the nicotine dosage with the patches. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

So there's this new girl in town

(Me) And she finally quit smoking! :3

I've been a smoker since I was 14 years old (freshman in high school) and up until almost 2 months from my 22nd birthday. I told myself every time I picked one up that I wasn't addicted and could stop anytime I wanted to. And I believed it. When I realized it had been almost 8 years since I had started, I knew I had a problem. See, I had smoked off and on for those years, but for months at a time each time. I was tired of turning to cigarettes when I'd had a rough day/night. Or convincing myself that another $5 is worth it to have a "release" from the stress or boredom of having nothing to do. I stopped cold turkey 16 days ago, and I have never felt more proud of myself! The 3rd and 4th days were horrible. I was having terrible withdraws and almost caved. What stopped me was the feeling of pure madness over how badly I wanted to smoke. How dare those chemicals tell my brain that I HAVE to have them to get through. THAT is what stopped me, and I am so so happy I didn't give in :)

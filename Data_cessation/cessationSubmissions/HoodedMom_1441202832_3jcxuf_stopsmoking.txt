Only been 24 hours, but I finally did it!

I have been a smoker for 30 years, my mother died of lung cancer and my father had COPD. I was always scared to try to quit, people had told me that you spend the rest of your life wanting a cigarette. I did not want to go through that for ever, and it scared me to death every time I thought about quitting. Recently, I've realized that even while I'm smoking that I don't really want them, so I've decided to try. Set my date as September first and haven't had one since the evening of August 31st. Still kind of terrified, part of me wants to light one anyway, especially with morning coffee or after a meal. But I want to do this, for me, for my kids, and for my grandkids. Maybe I will be around longer than the 66 years my mother was.
Well, it feels good just to put this out there. Thanks!

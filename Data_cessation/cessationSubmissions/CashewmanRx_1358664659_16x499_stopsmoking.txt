When did you have a noticeable recovery in lung function?

(9 year 1/2 ppd smoker)
I am 125 days quit( really 146 with a slip up) and have had worse asthma since quitting than ever in my life, my over all cardio exercise capacity has actually decreased as well and I sitll have significant sputum production, honestly to the point where I am thinking COPD may be a serious consideration, but I will sort that out at my doctors appointment. I really just want to know how long it took for you to notice your lung function return and how long had productive cough/mucus.

I am finishing pharmacy school, have been trained in tobacco cessation, and am relatively well versed in the natural changes in physiology of the body as well as the change in regards to epithelial cells of the lungs while smoking and after smoking. I am also aware  of the "reawakening" of the cilia after you quit and the natural increase in sputum for a while as the lungs clean out, as well as the fact that smoking can stifle asthma and cause a flare up when you quit.

TL;DR How long did you cough, When did your lung function level out? How much applesauce can you eat in a sitting(bonus)

4 weeks tomorrow. Posting tonight cuz I know I'm going to be there.

I quit smoking in 2001 after twenty years of smoking. At the time I had lived longer as a smoker than a non-smoker. Had a hard time quitting but finally succeeded ... for ten years.

Dumb me, after ten years of freedom I was as naive as any kid about smoking. Like any first time smoker, I had a smoke at a party for kicks.  Whoa, that smoking addict brain kicked in real fast, and I was smoking half a pack a day or more for three years. Very tough time quitting.

4 weeks into non-smoking, my ten years of non-smoker brain has kicked back in. I almost never think of smoking. The occasional surprise dream. A little tug now and again that is pushed aside almost effortlessly. Only one difference this round ... no more stupid mistakes.

Soldier on folks. The brain is plastic and can be re-programmed back to non-smoking. Loving it.

I am extremely good at quitting

I have been trying to quit smoking for years, and have stopped for long periods of time, some close to a year. I am almost at 1 1/2 days right now. I have been chewing regular gum, and I am very determined to quit this horrible habit. I don't want to start back up, I am in the gym 6 days a week, and I am trying to make this a part of a healthier life. Wish me luck people thank you.

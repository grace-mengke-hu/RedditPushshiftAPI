I just bought a tv with cigarette money.

[$7+ a day adds up quickly](http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_05771232000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&kispla=05771232000P&srccode=cii_17588969&cpncode=32-220073581-2).  Everyday you dont smoke, throw how much you would have spent on cigarettes in a jar.  Everytime you want to smoke, look at that jar.

After a few weeks, look at that jar again and tell me it wasnt worth it.  

Then break that jar open and buy yourself something fucking rad, like a go kart or some illegal fireworks.  Know that so long as you never smoke again you'll have tons of money for all this rad shit.

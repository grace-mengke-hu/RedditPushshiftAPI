Tips for first day/couple of days without smoking?

Hi! I'm 20 and have been smoking for around 3 years. I'm planning on going smoke free and was wondering if anyone had any tips/advice for the first day and such? 

I've spoken to my doctor and have nicotine patches. My partner is also going to be over to prevent me from buying some and to distract me. 

I'm a little nervous, but confident. I know it'll be easier to get past it now than it will later in life, and I'm looking forward to having the extra money!

Day 14 -2 Weeks and feeling better all the time

Today is a day of very mixed feelings 

At this stage in things I feel a lot less stressed but with a cautious sense that I have been here before. I don't want to forget how taxing the last two weeks have been mentally and physically. It is a portrait of a very diminished version of myself in the absence of something I should never have started. I don't ever want to go through that again. 

This is why my sense of accomplishment feels very metered at the moment. I don't want to let me guard down and believe that this wasn't that difficult.

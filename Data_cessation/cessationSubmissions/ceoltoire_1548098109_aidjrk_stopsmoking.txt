Day Five vent

This is definitely not my first quit... which I think makes things harder in a lot of ways. I quit a 20 a day habit 2 years ago and have been on and off 3-5 a day ever since. I really need to get this off my chest. 

I have this really strong underlying feeling throughout my entire day of ‘I can’t wait until I can have one’ or ‘won’t it be nice when I can smoke again after quitting for a while’. It’s not only a dangerous way of thinking but it’s exhausting because I keep toing and froing in my mind without actually making a hard decision that I’ll never smoke again. I can’t seem to bring myself to do it. 

I also hate who I am when I’m off them. I want to be me - the bubbly and engaged friend, partner, and child. I typically just feel miserable without cigs... like... what’s the point in getting through all the crap of the day if I can’t have one or two cigs in the evening? I don’t want to be irritable and low energy... I want my fire back. And Christ I don’t want to live a life like this either. 

And yet I stay off them...? 

I just want that relief again.

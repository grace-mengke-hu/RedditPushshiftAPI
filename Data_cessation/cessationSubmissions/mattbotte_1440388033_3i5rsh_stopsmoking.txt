The Journey Begins. (Day 1 or 4)

Well, this is the 4th day now without smoking and I'm excited for the joy and challenges ahead. I feel like I cheated the first 3 days; I was very unwell and didn't even have time to think about a cigarette. Day 4 and recovered honestly feels like day 1 again so bring it on! Rereading Alan Carr's book for the 2nd time too for extra support! Death to the death sticks!!! :D

Thanks all!

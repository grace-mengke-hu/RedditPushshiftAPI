Day 1 - Tips?

Hi there,

I've recently started smoking again for a brief period. I had stopped for about 3 years, maybe more. I think reading the book 'Easy Way To Smoking' by Allen Carr (no not the guy on tv lol) really helped me and helped me look at smoking in a different way. I would highly recommend the book btw for anybody who hasn't read it and wants to stop.

Today is day 1 for me and I was just hoping to get a few tips that would help me and others on our journey and not fall back into the pit of hell that is nicotine addiction.

The book insists on not using any substitute but I just can't seem to manage that so I got my self some weak strength patches to get me through the first week at least and break the habit again.

I wish you all the best!

Cheers

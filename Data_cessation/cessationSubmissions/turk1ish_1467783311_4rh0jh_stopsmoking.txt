"When did you quit?"

I don't post here often, guys. I try to keep up with you all but honestly I get distracted a lot. I haven't had many urges to smoke (I have had a few since quit day, not gonna lie.) so I've been pretty lucky.

My friend asked me today when I quit (I haven't talked to her for a few months) and I told her I honestly couldn't remember.

I just realized then that I've completely cut smoking from my life. I don't associate any activities (even drinking) with it anymore.

I feel like I did it! I still have a long ways to go, but damn do I feel good!

Day One. I'm only about 6 hours in and am feeling weak.

Smoker for almost 15 years here. This is my 3rd attempt at quitting. I've already removed all of my tobacco related items and am feeling really stressed out about it. I know it'll fade but it's already tough. My clean clothes smell like smoke and while it is honestly disgusting, it's a constant reminder of wanting to smoke. 

What do you do to keep busy when you want to smoke? 

I haven't had a meal yet, I'm most worried about that. Smoking after meals ~~is~~ was my favorite. Tips? Advice?

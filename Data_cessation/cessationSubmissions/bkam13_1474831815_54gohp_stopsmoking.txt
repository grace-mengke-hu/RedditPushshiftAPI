Almost a week smoke free (questions inside)

Hey guys, so just an update on my progress. I am still smoke free, relying pretty heavily on sugar free mints and my Brita water bottle to keep me satiated.

This is not the first time that I have quit smoking, but I am sure it's going to be the last time. I am just over cigarettes.

However, one thing that has been bothering me. Before I quit the first time (I quit for basically the month of July), I smoked for a couple of years (about 2 packs a week). When I quit I felt like crap for maybe a couple of days. Sinus issues, anxiety, etc. However I was able to control it. This time (smoked for a month and a half), my sinuses are out of control. I went to an urgent care doctor to see about it last week, and things have not gotten any better.

So my questions are have any of you guys gone through this? When you quit smoking, almost immediately you got sick in your sinuses and lungs? If so, how long did it last for you? (Not seeking medical advice, just curious)

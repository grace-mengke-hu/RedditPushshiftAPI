I'm triggered (xd)

I don't get how whenever I decide to quit and am doing good, 
problems seem to arise out of no where, as if the universe is tempting me to get back into smoking, by making me angry. 
Reminds me that nothing comes easy. And that you have to stick to your goals no matter what. No matter how hard it gets or what life throws at you. It's just temporary circumstances. 
But quitting on your journey, is like quitting forever.
Have to constantly remind myself that cigarettes never alleviated any suffering in the first place.
Contrary, it bought on my life much suffering.

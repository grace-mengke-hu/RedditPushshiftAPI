SO claims Chantix makes him smoke more?

Am an trying to quit using Chaotix, and convinced bf to try alongside of me, however very grudgingly so. Fast forward a couple of weeks, and he is claiming that the drug is causing him to smoke MORE, because it is preventing him from getting satisfaction from the nicotine. 

I feel like this is incredibly wrong, but my understanding of how it works isn't sufficient to explain this to him.

Is there any traction to his claim? Also could someone please ELI5 for both our benefit?

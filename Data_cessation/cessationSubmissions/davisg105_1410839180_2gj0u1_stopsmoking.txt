Been trying

Ok, so i have been trying to quit smoking. I have tried e-cigarettes (many kinds and even got down to 0 nicotine for a bit), lozenges, and gum.

I have gone to the extent of trying to replace it with sunflower seeds and corn nuts and the ilk. But I keep going back to cigarettes.

I'm wondering if any other tips or tricks for me. The issue is I smoke mainly when i am bored, or as so many others stressed. But when I dont smoke for a period of time, I just become increasingly irritable and angry and generally unpleasant (to the point that my sister bought me a pack once just to make me nice, and she wont ever support a 'bad habit')

I'm trying to quit, but it's starting to seem impossible....and at this point I actually dont enjoy smoking, but not smoking is worse somehow.

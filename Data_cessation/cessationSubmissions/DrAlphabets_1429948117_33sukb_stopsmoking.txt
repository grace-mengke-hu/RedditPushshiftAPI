I'm falling off the wagon and I don't know how to get back on

Last June I was hit by a drunk driver and as part of my basic physical recovery I inevitably made it through the first day, then first week, then first month of not smoking. I eventually went back to work and held it together for a while, then took some time off for a new baby and am now back at work. 

Suddenly though I'm having an incredibly difficult time not smoking. I've probably had at least a dozen cigarettes this month and I don't really have an action plan to get back on track. I work in a call centre right now with many people so I can just ask for one from someone without anyone getting too upset about me bumming smokes since I can spread them around pretty well. 

I dunno guys. I have the right reasons to quit. So I don't harm my baby. But I can't seem to get it under control right now. I think my biggest problem is that my previous progress wasn't really the result of hard work but more bad luck and now I don't really feel like I know how.

I really feel demotivated and need your guys help to figure out how to stop

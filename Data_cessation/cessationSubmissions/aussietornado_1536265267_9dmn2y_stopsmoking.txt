Smoking &amp; chronic pain

Just wanting to ask: anyone who has chronic pain (L5S1 fusion pain), has you pain level lessened/ disappeared after you quit smoking?

I was reading an article on the Spine Health website last week, and apparently there was a study conducted regarding smoking &amp; chronic pain, and cessation of smoking with a lowered amount of chronic pain in some people. I still currently smoke around 10 a day (sometimes only 5), and I'm wondering if that could be another cause of my continuing pain. Any thoughts?

I do have a quit date planned for after my last exams at the end of this semester- i want to wait till after those so i don't set myself up for failure.

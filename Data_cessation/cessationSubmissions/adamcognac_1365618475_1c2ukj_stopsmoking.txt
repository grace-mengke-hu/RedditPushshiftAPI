How did you stop little "cheats"?

I know I should stop smoking, and I've cut down literally 90%. I've even made it 3-4 months with about anything. However, I love smoking, and I don't even like the idea of NEVER enjoying a smoke.

Problem is, I know that cheating is a very slippery slope, and I'll never fully quit unless I FULLY quit. I currently manage it by wearing Nicotine patches and cheating when the situation is awesome. But that is getting expensive, and my skin is covered in red splotches and zits from the patches.

So what did you do to COMPLETELY kick this habit?

Easy Way Book didnt work

Background info: 26 yr old female, started smoking age 18. Took a year to feel addicted. Hate that I smoke and have hated it since I realized I was addicted. So an article on buzzfeed recommended the easy way and I bought the ebook and read it in on night thinking it would work. The following day, yesterday, I was doing pretty good. Ate lunch, had a craving so I walked the dog. But when I ate again (dinner at my parents house), that extra fullness was too much to bear so I bought a pack. I have nicotine gum at my house (friend gave a bunch to me that she didn't use) as well as a vape set up and juices. 
The book did not work. So I need to put in the work. I'm still young but last winter I got bronchitis and had to get breathing treatments for the first time. I also have asthma that I never had prior to smoking. So obviously 8 years of cigs are showing their mark. I think I will try the gum next, being more deliberate in how I chew and park it (I've just chewed and parked kinda willynilly). The sad thing is my asthma and breathing problems aren't consistent enough or prove to be a big enough problem for me to say goodbye for good. I always tell myself I want to quit, need to quit, all going to quit and am not strong enough to see it through. When I bought the book it really was almost random, as I randomly saw the buzzfeed article. I think I need to plan the quitting. Set a date. Prepare. Reading the book didn't magically do it as I was expecting lol.

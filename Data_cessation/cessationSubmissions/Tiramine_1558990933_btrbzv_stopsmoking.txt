Sixth day smoke-free

After many failed attempts I am now six days smoke-free and five days nicotine free! (did the patch for my first day) It's very hard, I get cravings that sometimes last an hour and it's been hard emotionally, too. Sometimes I wonder what the point of life is if I can't smoke, or why it matters that I'm saving money when the only thing I want to buy is more cigs (stupid, I know). 

But it's really nice to be able to spend more time with my family and not have to keep secrets anymore, not have to worry about bringing my smokes with me everywhere or running out to get some more. I don't feel as thirsty all the time, which is great. I'm about to go out to the bookstore and get myself something nice as a reward. It'll be exciting to reach the one week mark tomorrow.

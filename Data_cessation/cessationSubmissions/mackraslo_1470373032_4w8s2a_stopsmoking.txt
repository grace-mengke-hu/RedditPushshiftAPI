Nearing the end of day 5.

I have been smoking since I was 16. I am 29 now, turning 30 next month. 

I am currently nearing the end of day 4 of my quit attempt. I have been using an electric vape with 0.3 nicotine in the liquid. plus some nicotine inhalers, not at the same time tho.

Going strong, already getting my smell back. Walked by a market today and smelled a smell from my childhood, brought back some good memories. Feeling like I have more energy.

I knew all the positives quitting would bring, but for whatever reason I just couldnt make it past day 1. I am happy I am on a good streak now, gotta make sure I keep my motivation.

Thanks for letting me share. :)

EDIT~~~~~~~~~ Should say end of day 4 in my title. haha

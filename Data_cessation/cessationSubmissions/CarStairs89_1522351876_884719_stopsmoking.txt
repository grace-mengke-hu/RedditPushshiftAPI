Bad things will happen around the time you quit smoking...

Smoker on and off for going on 10 years now. It has began to impact my health in annoying ways, elevated blood pressure, IBS, insomnia, and the like. I thought it may have just been a coincidence but in the past as well as now I will make up my mind to quit smoking and suddenly something will invite extreme stress into my life, quite literally the next day if not sooner. I will not bore you with long-winded details but it's always more than enough to make jumping back into chain-smoking seem like the best/only kind of comfort. There is never "choosing a good time," things will seem quiet and normal and then BAM! pet dies, close relative dies, car breaks down, and so on. There's no gradual evidence that something wasn't right as signs of an impending doom, it would occur immediately and it has never failed. 

Surely, I am not the only one to experience this. Post stories, own experiences, and suggestions please.

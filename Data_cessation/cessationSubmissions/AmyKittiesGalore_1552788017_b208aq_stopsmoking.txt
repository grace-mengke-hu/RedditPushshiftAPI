Time to quit vaping

Ok so I quit cigarettes on Nov 12th, 2017 (yay!) It was a tough journey as you all know, but not even as hard as I thought it was going to be! I quit cold turkey for 5 months and was doing so good when I decided to start vaping for some stupid unknown reason. At first it was just at parties and then a little more and after a few months it was full on, every day, all the time. Now I have finally decided that I need to take quitting seriously, and I have not vaped since yesterday morning. So far so good! 🤞🏼

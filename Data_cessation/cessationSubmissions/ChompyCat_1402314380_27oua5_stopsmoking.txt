One whole year smoke-free

I had my last cigarette on June 8th, 2013 at a wedding. I was the designated driver, bored out of my mind all night, and ended up smoking the better part of a pack of cigarettes in one night. The next morning, I felt awful and I knew it was time. 

I'd thought of myself as a "social smoker" for 18 years--that realization was sobering. And more and more, I was moving into "light daily smoker" territory, using it as a crutch for any situation or emotion I felt I couldn't handle, and even smoking at night as a "treat" to myself after a long day at work.

So I decided to quit cold turkey using [a tool that turned out to be a bit controversial around here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1g1lx9/social_smoker_for_18_years_if_i_smoke_again_focus/): I wrote out a $250 check to Focus on the Family  and asked my partner to mail it if I ever smoked again. The thought of an organization I despise getting my money was enough to keep me honest through those first few months, as I tackled my smoking triggers one by one: drinking, at a party, at a wedding, stressful day after work, hanging out with certain friends, etc. After a few months, I learned I could handle any situation without a cigarette in my hand. Now the thought of having one doesn't even cross my mind.

About a month ago, I ran across the check tucked away in a drawer and tore it up. This weekend, I was at another wedding with the same group of people, and smoking was the last thing on my mind. It's amazing what a difference a year makes!

Though I wasn't very active in this community, it was instrumental in my success. Just reading the posts here was incredibly helpful, so thanks to all of you! And to any other light/social/only-when-I'm-drinking smokers out there: you can do it. Quit today!

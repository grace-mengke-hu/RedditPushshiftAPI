no pressure allowed

Hei guys, 
so here's my 5 cents.
I've been smoking since I was 11. Jap, you saw that right. Am turning 28 soon. Have quit 3 times before, once for 2 years.

I've been wanting to quit for a long time now, and on saturday I woke up, put on my running shoes and did not lit a cig.
I have however puffed a few smokes of a dobbie (is that spelled right?). 
That has allways suppresed the urge to smoke a cigarette.

I haven't allowed any pressure from myself, cigarettes or anything else get to me. I AM strong willed. I may puff a few along the way. Have tried cold turkey, did not succeede. Just no pressure, so I won't feel angry and dissapointed with myself if I fail, 'couse that will only encurage me to smoke more.
I think this will work for me.

Anyway, best of luck and strong will to all of you and be proud of yourself, even if it's just browsing for motivation.

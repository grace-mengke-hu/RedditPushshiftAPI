Anyone else severely depressed?

I feel like my mental health has plummeted. The smallest inconveniences feel like a punch to the gut, my self esteem is basically gone, and I lash out at people constantly. I cry at least twice a day from "the weight of the world", which shouldn't even be that heavy. Anyone have any tips? I've been to therapy etc in the past, but if this is a side effect from quitting I don't want to rely on antidepressants and the like.

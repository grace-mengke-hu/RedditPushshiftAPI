need to get off nicotine lozenges today, would appreciate some advice

So i quit smoking like a dozen or more times this year alone.  I havent smoked in a week and that was minimal and tobacco free the week before.  nicotine lozenges are great, i have surgery coming up soon and need to be off all nicotine.  during my workday i go  through a ton of altoid mini's to combat my cravings and only use nicotine lozenge when drinking coffee.  at home and in my off time i hardly use nicotine lozenges mostly when i drink coffee.  giving up coffee isnt going to happen before surgery.  suggestions that dont include gum or lollipops.

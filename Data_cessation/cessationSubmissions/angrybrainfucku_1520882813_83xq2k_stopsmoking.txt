Beat yourself, scream, punch in the air, get angry, irritated, depressed, frustrated or happy, sad, whatever but just do not let yourself smoke.

I just had an unexpected phone sex with a stranger female . After that I felt guilty, ashamed, funny and immature . It's past midnight now and I'm mentally craving cigarettes, I mean I feel like I need one. For Last 7 years I smoked cigarettes after every orgasm.
SO it has become a huge trigger for me. This is just a beginning of day 11 after a very bad yesterday. I have relapsed many times, so I'm experienced. But this time I'm not gonna make myself just pick up a fucking cigarette and smoke it. I will fucking punch my teeth out if I even get any closer to a cigarette. I am just dragging myself out of this addiction. My best quit was for 62 days cold turkey 4 years ago. I know I can do it, and I'm doing it. I'm fucking doing it. No matter what I do I fucking have nothing to do with cigarettes. I have a very very strong believe that once I am able to not smoke a single puff for 90 days. I will never need it . 79 more days. Please God if you really exist help me to drag myself that far otherwise I am doing it for myself . 79 more days that's all I want. I quitted smoking just before the day of my 25th Birthday after a lot of Procrastination. I'm doing Meditation and cardio exercise since when I quitted smoking. Smoking is the only thing that I need to get rid of first of all. I believe once I can quit smoking successfully I can fucking do everything.
Anger, irritation, mood swings, depression, unhealthy eating whatever I have to go through I will go through, remember you fucking nicotine once I'm out of your reach (90days)I will fucking kill you out of my brain .


Suffer as much as you have to BUT JUST DON'T SMOKE.

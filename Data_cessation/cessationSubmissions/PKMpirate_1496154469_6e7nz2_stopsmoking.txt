Trouble breathing deeply

I quit about a month ago. After the first week my lungs actually felt like they had opened up and I could breathe a lot better. But now i seem to be noticing that the tightness shortness of breath have become very noticeable again. Was this the case with y'all? Im just wondering when ill be able to breathe well again. Was a pack a day smoker for 14 years. Glad that shit show is over ðŸ˜¥

Clear hearing

I am sure to an extent withdrawal is different to all. But I have never really heard anyone describe what I experience. So I will be that first person now.

After the first few hours no smoke I enjoy music better. It is as if it reaches me better. This effect hasn't worn off yet. I can listen intently to songs and be drawn to them infinitely more then when I would be smoking. It's amazing. I hear things in the songs which I never noticed in the 100+ times I listened them before.

This is still happening and it's great! I like this the most so far from quitting smoking (at least as one of the active things I experience because health concerns are the prime motivator).

I am also enjoying songs I would have otherwise skipped.

Alternatively, I hear how terrible some songs are which I would have enjoyed a week ago.

Strange eh!

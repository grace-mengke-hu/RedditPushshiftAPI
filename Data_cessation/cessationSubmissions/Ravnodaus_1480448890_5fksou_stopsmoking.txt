Help. Break-up... and, urges returning fierce.

I don't know how to process these feeling effectively, and in the meantime I am a roller coaster of emotion. I know that is normal, But I'm worried I'm going to light up during one of my self despair self sabotage moments and then I'll be addicted again.

How do I do this? I stopped myself last night, but I was mid-drive to go buy some out of some twisted dark urge. I'm afraid I will falter again and not come to my senses in time. Any advice is welcome.

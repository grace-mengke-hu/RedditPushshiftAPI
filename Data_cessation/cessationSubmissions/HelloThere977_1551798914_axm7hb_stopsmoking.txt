Need advice

I’m 21 and live with my dad. I have been smoking reguraly since I was about 16. Since I’ve been with my girlfriend I have tried to smoke less because I realised how bad it is for me. I can barely run a small distance and I’m a guy in his early twenties, which should be when you’re the most fit. 
At some times I can smoke less but as soon as stressful periods come I cave and smoke a lot more.
It doesn’t help that my dad smokes inside and so do I...
My mother and my grandmother also smoke but a bit less and so does my gf, but significantly less.
I think I’m really week and cave easily into the temptation. I also smoke when I’m bored because I’m home a lot. I’m also bad at sports so the only options is running which I hate and the Gym, which I can’t stand.

I downloaded the smoke free app and will try to quit by May 5th, but I don’t have much faith in myself honestly.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

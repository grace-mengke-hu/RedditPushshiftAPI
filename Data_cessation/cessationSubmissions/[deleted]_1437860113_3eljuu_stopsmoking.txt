Something strange happened today...

I'm not a heavy smoker but I smoke when I drink and I drink on the weekends.  I know what this can turn into, so I've been smoke free for about a week now.

When I was taking a shower I used my normal soap and is smelled, different.  It smelled stronger, and I could smell parts of it that I hadn't before. It was really nice and holy crap my sense of smell is coming back! 

Smoking dulls such a great part of life, the ability to taste and smell.  Fuck smoking.

Just another small plus of not giving money to evil bastards while at the same time killing your body.  Hooray!

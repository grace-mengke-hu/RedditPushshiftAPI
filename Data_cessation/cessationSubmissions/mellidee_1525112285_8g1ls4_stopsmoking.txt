I have one cigarette left, and then it's time.

I've smoked for fourteen years. I did 'quit', cold turkey, for a full year about nine years back, but even after that long I slipped back. This time I'm going to try using the patch. And lollipops. Wish me luck, I hope my heart's in it this time. I know this is for the best but I just feel sad, like I'm losing an old friend. What a pathetic way to look at it. Sigh. Here we go.

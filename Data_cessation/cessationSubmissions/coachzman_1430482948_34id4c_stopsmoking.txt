Quitting for good.

So I'm actually quitting this time (3rd time), but I have help now. My doctor put me on Chantix. It is proving to actually work for me. I don't want to smoke anymore. The prescription shuts something off in me. I will admit, I tried a cigarette this morning from a co-worker, not because I wanted one, but as a test. The best and craziest part was that initial high. It was gone. That used to be my favorite part. And now, nothing. It's so great. So if you need help, I can vouch that Chantix really works. At least it is for me :)
Thanks guys!

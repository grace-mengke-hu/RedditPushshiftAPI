You can do it! It really gets easier!

I figured I was going to be a life-long smoker. It was one of those things that I needed to keep myself sane. Turns out, it was also keeping me from a lot of awesome things. Biking 20 miles is really nice, but so is just being able to climb stairs without getting winded. I used to smoke close to two packs a day. If I can do it, you can too. You got this!

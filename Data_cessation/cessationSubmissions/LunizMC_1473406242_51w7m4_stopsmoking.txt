TMI, sorry

Badges seem to be fixed, so as you can tell I'm two weeks in.  Over the last few days, I've noticed that my stool is .... well .... to say runny would be an understatement.  It's been like a brown sludge.

Is that shit (excuse the pun) normal as part of the transition and giving up?  I've generally gone with the 'if it ain't black or bleeding, it's ok' policy.

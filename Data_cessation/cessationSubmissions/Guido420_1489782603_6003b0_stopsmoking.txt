Saint Paddy's Day is one of my favorite holidays to celebrate now.

Two years ago on Saint Paddy's Day I decided to quit cold turkey after 20 years of smoking.  The first 4 days were hell.  At six months I declared that I would start smoking again at a year if the cravings didn't subside; I would rather be a smoker than a non-smoker with constant cravings.  Well, I guess the cravings did subside because here I am two years later, still smoke free.  I barely think about it now, and when I do it is more often to remark how happy I am that I quit rather than lamenting its loss.

Hang in there friends.  If I can do it, you can too.  And I promise you your life will be better.

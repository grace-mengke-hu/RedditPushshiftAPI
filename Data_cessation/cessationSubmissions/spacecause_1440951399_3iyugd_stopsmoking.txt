Today's the Day

Today I decided enough was enough. I hadn't planned it or been building up to it by cutting down, but I was just fed up of smoking and decided to quit cold turkey. I have set up an excel spreadsheet of the different milestones I need to beat and know if i can make it 72 Hours (2nd September) I will be over the worst of it and should be fine.

To anyone lurking who wants to quit but thinks they need a lot of preparation or want to put it off again and again, take this plunge with me and just stop cold turkey. It will help me, it will help you and as we are in the same boat we can motivate each other to make it until the 2nd of September and further.

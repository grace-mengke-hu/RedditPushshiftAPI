Thank you to everyone! I'm new as shit, but I'm already feeling more confident in my choice to quit. Glad to be a part of a badass community that understands. 

If anyone enjoys meditating, Passage Meditation by Eknath Easwaran has helped guide me through emotions and cravings that have arisen over the past few days. If you need to reboot your headspace, check it out. 

I'm excited to be a part of this!

Fear of Withdrawal is what kept me smoking

I think the main reason I was unable to quit in the beginning was because I assumed that I would always be craving a cigarette for the rest of my life.  I feared life-long withdrawal.

If you feel the same way, I am honestly telling you that there is nothing to fear.  You will forget about smoking so quickly.  For me, I forgot about cravings after about 3 months.  

Be disciplined about never smoking again, and then just wait.  Freedom will be yours! I swear it!!!

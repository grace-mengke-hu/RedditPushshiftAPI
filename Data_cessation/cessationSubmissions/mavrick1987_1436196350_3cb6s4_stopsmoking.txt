I've smoked for 10 years and it's time to quit.

I realized last week that it was the 10-year anniversary of my first cigarette.

I started right after I graduated high school on a senior trip in Cancun. Since then, I have smoked about 1/2- a pack a day. It has been such a huge part of my life and I associate it with so many things since it basically has been a part of me since I was 18. When I was in college most of my study friends smoked and when we would pull all-nighters at the library smoking outside, talking about anything and everything, were some of my most memorable experience of my college life. I always told myself I would quit when I graduated college. Well, it's been 5 years and I'm still smoking.    
    
    
I work in pharmaceutical research, specifically oncology, so I have always felt ashamed smoking a cigarette outside a cancer ward but made justifications for it. Now is the time for me to quit I can't make any more excuses. It has inhibited me from so many things, especially relationships.    
    
So, I quit! My job is extremely stressful and the break for the holiday was my best opportunity to get over the initial cravings with limited stress. I had a successful weekend without any cigarettes or e-cigs. I realized that I have almost no self-control right now when I'm drinking with people that are smoking so I stayed sober for most of the weekend. I just wanted to put this out there so I had a little bit of accountability. I hope this time it works!

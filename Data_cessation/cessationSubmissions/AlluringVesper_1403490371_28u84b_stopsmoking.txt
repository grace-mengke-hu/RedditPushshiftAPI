One week down...checking in

So, made it through week one. It's been tough these last few days. Headaches got worse over last week, finally abating in the last day or so. The biggest issue for me has been a short temper. I just get really frustrated and aggravated over the tiniest of things. I've realized this shortly after it happened each time and went back and apologized to whoever I snapped at. Luckily, I have some great people around me who know that I'm trying to quit and are ok with me snapping every once in a while as long as I don't go smoke afterwards.

I did have a small success last night. Normally my downfall when trying to quit before was going out drinking with friends and I just casually bum one off somebody at the bar and end up buying a pack shortly thereafter. I'm moving to a new city soon for a new job and some friends and I went out to a hole-in-the wall bar we used to go to alot. Smoking is allowed inside at this place and I was a little worried about the temptation to ask someone for a smoke. Long story short, made it through the night without smoking and enjoyed my evening with friends. Still have a long ways to go, but that was my most tempting moment so far and I pulled though without a cig.

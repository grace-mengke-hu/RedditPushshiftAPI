Day 4 nicotine free

I really thought the cravings would get easier after day 3. I was wrong. As soon as I woke up today I wanted a cigarette and I have not been able to stop thinking about it. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. And I'm a full blown junkie that quit shooting meth and have been in long term recovery for 4 years. Aaaaaah! Lol

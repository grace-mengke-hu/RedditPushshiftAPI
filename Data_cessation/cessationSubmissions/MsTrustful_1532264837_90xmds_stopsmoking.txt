The morning after I quit

Woke up with a headache after a restless night. I've done this before. Twice. I had quit for over a year but let myself start again. I'm tired of burning through the money. Between my husband and I we spend $525 a month on tobacco products. That's insane. I want to be able to buy a new car. Get my bills straight. Take my kids on vacation. 

I miss how I was able to breathe after I quit the last time. How I could smell everything. I was able to run easier. Water tasted so much better. It was easier to keep up with a toddler and an infant. I felt like super mom.

So every time I think I want to smoke, I'm going to remember all of this. Smoking isn't worth all of this. I have never woken up and felt like smoking has made me healthier. Instead I always wake up feeling like shit, like I smoked too much. 

I just can't let the anxiety get to me. I know how the next few days, weeks, and months are going to go. It's going to get easier.

So I wake up the morning after the day I quit smoking confident. It will get easier.

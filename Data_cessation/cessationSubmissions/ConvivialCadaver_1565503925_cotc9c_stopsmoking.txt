Nicotine Content of Different Brands

Hello, I think this is my first Reddit post.
I've been smoking for two years. I've tried quitting multiple times. I'm an almost-pack-a-day smoker. I want to maybe try a lower-nicotine cigarette, because research has shown that those who successfully switched to lower-nicotine cigs have less nicotine cravings, and are more likely to quit smoking.
Would somebody be able to inform me of the nicotine content for cigarette brands in the US? Especially cheap ones. Thanks

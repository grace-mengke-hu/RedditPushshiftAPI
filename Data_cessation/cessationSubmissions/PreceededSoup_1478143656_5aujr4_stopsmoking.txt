Just checking in

I think it's been almost two weeks since I last smoked, started a final attempt on a reduced Chantix dose for a few days, then scrapped the drug after the initial nicotine withdrawal passed. 

I still get urges but I think the big difference this time is that I actually want to quit. All the other times I knew I should quit, but couldn't stop thinking about how much I enjoyed smoking. 

I'm all set with that now. Any time I get the urge my immediate response is, "I don't want to smoke", instead of, "I wish I had a smoke right now." 

I started a new bank account with a weekly auto transfer for the amount I was spending on cigarettes. It helps to actually see the money grow instead of just knowing how much it would be. 

Anyway, I don't want to smoke, even when I want to. F that.

I just quit.

I just threw away my cigarettes and chew. I'm done. Forever. I just wanted to come here at tell you guys because I've browsed here before and you guys have given me a bit of encouragement. Even with that said. I'm done. I'm fuckin' done. 

A little story as to why I made up my mind. Yesterday was my daughters 1st birthday party. (as if that isn't a reason enough).  My sister-in-law's dad showed up. He's a 50 something who's had 2 open heart surgeries. He collapsed in the garage on his way in. I ran to his aid and asked if he was alright. He just said "Whew, that was intense! That was the most intense pain I've had in a while." I didn't ask what hurt. I just know he's a mess. I help him up and continue with the party. Not 10 minutes later I see him on the side of the house smoking. I felt disgusted. I've been smoking for 16 years and I'm over 30. I'm gonna be that guy? For my daughter? Fuck that. 

That is all. I'd say "wish me luck" but I don't need it. I'm fucking done.

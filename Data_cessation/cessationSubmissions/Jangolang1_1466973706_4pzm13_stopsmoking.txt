How do you guys do it

Everytime i try to quit i get overwhelmed with the feeling that i need to smoke. I know how horrible it is for me to continue smoking but those thoughts disapear when im craving..

I think my add medicine makes it worse because atleast the temptations are not as strong when ive been off it. 

I need my meds to function properly, so quiting those arent an option. 

What works for you guys? Should i set a quit date and do cold turkey?

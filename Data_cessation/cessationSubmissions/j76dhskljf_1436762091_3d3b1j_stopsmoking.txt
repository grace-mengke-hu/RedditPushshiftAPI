Wanting to just give in

Hey all, new subscriber, not in a great place and trying to reach out so I can try and turn back at the pass. If nothing else just need to vent. TLDR; finally making progress on quitting but feeling challenged by returning home where there are lots of triggers, notably a fucked up family situation currently going down

I'm a week quit now, but before having 5 cigs on the 4th of July I hadn't had one in 3 weeks (still mad at myself for fucking up my streak because I've never made it past 2 weeks in 7.5 years of smoking). I started quitting on April 1 and thus began a long period where I wasn't quite on or off the wagon, kind of just being dragged behind the wagon as I tried and failed over and over again to quit, never making it past a week or so. Now I've FINALLY gotten to the point of not constantly falling off the wagon...but I'm getting really close to caving.

I've been living on the road since June which has overall been really helpful for quitting, some triggers are enhanced but most are minimized with this lifestyle compared to working and a more routine schedule (for me). I'm flying home on Wednesday because I have a stupid traffic court date, but going home is going to be really triggering (since that is where I have done pretty much all my smoking - smoker friends, lack of accountability because my SO won't be there, that kind of thing). Additionally I have a shit storm of family drama going on that is really waning my resolve. I know having a cig isn't going to make things better, if anything it will make me feel worse, but fuck sometimes I just don't feel like I have it in me to fight the good fight every day, and just want to give in to the addiction so it's at least one less thing on my plate.

But I know this is totally the addiction talking and the reality of smoking is different from the fantasy my addicted brain has conjured up trying to get me to smoke. It's just so fucking hard. Cigarettes suckkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!

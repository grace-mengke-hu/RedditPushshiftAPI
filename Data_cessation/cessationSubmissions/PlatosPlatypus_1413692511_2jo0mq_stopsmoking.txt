Keep it up, guys.

I recently moved to a new city. Yesterday, I thought of a friend back home who had been trying to quit for a while, and had a few weeks under her belt when I left. I called her up last night to see how it was going, and now she's got 17 weeks. So proud. She thanked me for my advice (I told her to get Allen Carr's book) and help, and I told her that she'd done all the hard work.

This is what really stuck out to me. She told me she couldn't believe that she used to think that she got something out of smoking, that it did anything positive for her. She was remembering all the mornings when she'd felt hungover, body destroyed from the night before, and managed to to cough down a cigarette despite the waves of nausea. It wasn't helping her. It wasn't making her feel better. It was just one more obstacle she was throwing in her own way.

I'm not a subscriber to this sub any more, but every now and then I get curious to see how long it's been and come back to check my counter. Just passed 3 years.

Keep it up guys. Your life is important. It gets better. You can do this.

Quit on 2nd January 2017, relapsed on 11th Jan. Starting on Day 0 again

I quit on 2nd Jan but suffered from severe gastrointestinal issues starting the morning of 11th Jan. It was I believe nothing more than part of the withdrawal and normally I would have beared it and moved forward with my quit as I had done for the past ten days. But I had to take an important business trip starting from that day, I had worked for that trip for the past 4 months and failing to go on that trip would have meant a bad year for our business. 

I debated with myself through out the day and ended up smoking late in the evening when even a trip to the hospital for some SOS medication , anything to prevent my relapse, failed to provide relief.   Unfortunately relief did not come until next day by when I had already missed my flight and had to buy new tickets at exorbitant prices and I had smoked through the night and early morning and was in a full blown relapse. 

Now I am back from the trip and well rested and would like to quit again. Have been trying for 3/4 days but end up giving in just 2-3 hours into my quit. I just want the kick start where I don't smoke for a full day and then I am confident that come hell or high water, I will not smoke again. Any words of advice ?

Hellish cravings for the past 2 1/2 hours. Could the dreaded "one" cigarette help?

As the title says, I'm craving out the wazoo... for hours now! What can I do? Closing time is drawing relatively near for the nearby grocery stores and kiosks. What do I do? The craving has subsided two, maybe three times, since it started. I feel like a steam cooker... What can I do to alleviate this NOW?!

Edit: Would one cigarette from a friend really be that bad if I stuck to not spending *any* money on cigarettes or tobacco??

edit 2: I`m not sure if I`ll be able to sleep without one tonight, and tomorrow I`ll have to leave early.

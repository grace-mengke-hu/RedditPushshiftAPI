Tomorrow is the big day!

Soon to be 27 and have been smoking a pack ish since 19. I am so feed up with smoking, its disgusting, pricey and a big health risk. I just don't want to stop and I know it will be difficult but I will have my last cigarette tonight!! My pack will be half full and am planing on still taking it with me, just so I can prove to myself that those little fuckers don't hold any power over me. 

Just had to share it somewhere as I don't want to tell friends/family yet, this is for me. Wish me luck reddit

How did you pick the date of quitting? Did you pick a date at all?

Hi, I really want to quit smoking. One big issue for me, however, is procrastination. So what I want to do is to just pick a specific date, quit on that particular day, and then work on not touching a cigarette ever again.

In this regard my question is in the title basically - was there anything special about the date you chose to quit? Or maybe it was a spontaneous idea (like - "right now")? What was your thought process going into that last particular day of smoking?

Any input would be very much appreciated.

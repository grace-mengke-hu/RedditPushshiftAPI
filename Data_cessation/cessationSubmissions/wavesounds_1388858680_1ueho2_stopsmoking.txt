I fucking hate tobacco

I've been smoke free for like 6 months or something and let me tell you there are few things in this world I hate more then cigarettes.  They are filthy, they smell terrible, they make you cough, make your lungs hurt and they piss off everyone around you! Worst of all, they don't actually provide any pleasure! They only provide relief from the pain they cause! How I ever got suckered into paying some stupid corporation money every single fucking day for the privilege of possibly giving myself cancer and making myself feel shitty all the time is beyond me.  The only thing I've gained from smoking cigarettes is that now when I do something stupid I can say to myself, "well at least its not as dumb as getting addicted to cigarettes".  I am so much healthier now, I exercise everyday and its no problem, its easy, like how its supposed to be.  Please if you're reading this and you think you like cigarettes consider the possibility you're lying to yourself to avoid short term discomfort, chances are you're like me and you fucking hate those things. And once you realize you fucking hate them it makes quitting a lot easier.

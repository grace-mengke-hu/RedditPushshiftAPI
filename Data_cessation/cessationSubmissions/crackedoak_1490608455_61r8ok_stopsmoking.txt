I don't understand.

A little backstory on my smoking. First of all, I never found myself to be addicted to the nicotine part of smoking, and just smoked out of boredom or when being social. I smoked Marb Reds, Camel Straights (unfiltered) and Lucky Strikes (when I could get them). I could stop for months at a time and then pick it back up afterwards without an issue. I would usually only smoke when around other smokers or when drinking. My smoking picked up when I started my military contract. Everyone smoked, dipped, or both, and I was a part of the crowd. After I got out of the military, it waned, and I smoked on and off with a pack lasting me roughly a month or so because I would smoke only when bored. I fixed this by buying a vape, and just using that to stop smoking cigarettes, and quit doing that 2 months later because I surmised that I just like the habit of putting something up to my lips and breathing it in.
Cue last week. Haven't had a smoke or a vape for about a year but got offered a smoke from a buddy just this week. Since that cigarette I'm on edge and craving and I don't know why. I have NEVER craved a smoke like this and I want it to stop. Why am I craving it now all of a sudden?
I'm thinking of purchasing another vape to replace my old one just so I don't cave and buy a pack.
I'm 27 now, and I started at 16 with my highest cigarette intake on my first deployment at 2 packs a day when I was 22. I also have a trigger to smoke whenever I see someone smoking, or hear a lighter being lit or pulled on.
This feeling is really getting to me and really bothers me. I don't want to smoke anymore because I'm on the, and I really like breathing freely.

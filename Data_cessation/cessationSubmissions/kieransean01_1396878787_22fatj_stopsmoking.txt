What's this old feeling I just experienced? Such a coincidence it's almost funny.

Preparing for sleep with nightly ritual- Playing music with a burning candle and burning Icense.
So I reached my hand over the candle to tap  the ash off the Incence (felt really strange tapping ash off a stick) and as I did this the candle burnt my hand, so I smelt my hand and it smelt absolutely gross from the smell of burnt hair on my hand, all these old practices  returned to me in a difference form or scents and light, but I took it as a sign! Because it felt so alien to me having to tap ash off a stick, or my hand smelling so bad,  because I'm so used to these things not happening anymore. And all it did was furthermore remind me that I'll never go back!!!

To new quitters- THE HABBIT DISSAPEARS! Once you break your addiction you forget everything about smoking it drops to the back of your head!  I hope this helps!

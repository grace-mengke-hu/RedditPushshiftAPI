Anyone else gained weight since they quit?

So this might seem stupid, I quit almost a month ago, and since then I've been gaining weight. I know this comes from the fact I'm eating more than I did when I was smoking, but it's kind of getting me down.

Anyone else have or is having a similar experience? Any advice on how to eat less? I'm pretty sure it's my coping mechanism for not having cigs around.

Thanks!

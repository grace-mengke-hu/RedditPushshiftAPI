Making damn good progress.

Hey all. I've decided to stop smoking once and for all. Thus far I am three full days without a cigarette and haven't had many cravings at all. I've even gotten drunk every night this week and managed to not cave. Thanks to all of you for this subreddit and to those of you who gave me tips, you are saving my life.

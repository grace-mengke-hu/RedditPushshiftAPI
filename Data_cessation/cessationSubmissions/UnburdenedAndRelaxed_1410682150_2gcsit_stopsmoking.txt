3 weeks, checking in.

Feeling better each day. I've carried on with my life in just about the same way I did as a smoker, so nothing really triggers me anymore. My mood and sleep patterns are back to normal. I can breathe deeply. 3 weeks feels different for me. 


Last week I was feeling it bad and one day I was ready to go to the store and by a pack, but I managed to convince myself to calm down and wait it out. I told myself to see how I felt in an hour or two and make my decision then. The cravings subsided and I didn't feel I needed a cigarette. The next day I was driving to see a friend and had the same thoughts. I was nervous because she smoked and we were going out to drink, but I remembered how I prevailed the day before and felt confident I could make it through the night, and I didn't smoke. Each day I face some challenges and one by one I get through them. There are still occasional thoughts and urges, but I don't dwell on them. If one sticks around for too long, I try to remember that my nicotine addiction did not contribute to my quality of life and I try not to romanticize smoking. 

I hope you are all doing well.

381 Days! Holy Moly!

I smoked almost non-stop since I was 14. I may have mustered a 2 month break here and there, or had a few days where I didn't "smoke that much" but to be completely quit for a whole year was unimaginable.

It has opened up so many opportunities. I got a new job at a smoke free campus. To be honest, I was intimidated to apply for a university job because I knew that I would have to go off campus to smoke. Who wants to ride a bus or walk a mile to smoke?!?! I got a brand new car, which I had always gotten shit mobiles because I felt ok nastying them up with ash, butts, and smoke. I get sick less often, feel more comfortable around people, and I am to the point where I do not miss it one bit. I see people outside smoking and I am so grateful to not stand in the snow (it was -6 here yesterday!)

Now here I am! I have been sober and free of drugs and alcohol for 6 years and now cigarette free for over a year!

Once I started addressing why I smoked, got real with myself about smoking, I was able to do it!

I used Chantix for about 2 weeks, but it made me so crazy. I would never do it again. However, I really contribute my success to reading Allen Carr's "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" in addition. Read the whole thing! Whether smoking or not. It changed my whole perspective on nicotine, myself, and smoking.

If you are just starting for New Years, you can do it!!!!

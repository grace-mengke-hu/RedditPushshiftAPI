I'm done! For good

I'm sick and tired of this addiction and how it has degraded me slowly over just one year. Looking at the person I was before I started is a day and night diffrence. I kid myself over a year that I needed to something as stupid as cigarettes. Telling myself that I needed to do it when I was completely fine without it. Quitting over and over again without realising that the only reason I was doing it was to smoke those few more cigarettes. I've been brought to rock bottom and things are going to change from here. No more not ever. One is too many and a thousand isn't enough.

That was short lived. :(

Yesterday morning I posted about how awesome it was to have so much more energy and only on day 4. Unfortunately, I didn't make it through the day. I would've, I think, if circumstances were different. I get to see my boyfriend once, sometimes twice a week - which really sucks especially since we live together (work schedules.) Well, last night he got off early and bought a six pack of beer. You can see where this is heading. I was actually doing fine. We watched a movie drank some beer at home then he says "I'm sorry, I just have to." He goes outside to smoke a cigarette. I go outside and don't ...at first. Then as the night went on I took a drag or two. Which tasted awful, by the way. The cigarette after that didn't taste as bad, but I felt awful. I woke up this morning with that all-too-familiar rough feeling in my throat, and a new sense of shame. I'm so mad at myself I cried. Today I smoke one on my lunch break. I will have to start all over now. :(


Edit: I'm not giving up, I think this just really drove home the message that there is no such thing as "just one."

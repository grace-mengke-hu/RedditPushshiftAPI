Accidentally smoked today

Someone passed me what I thought was a blunt (also something I'm trying to stay away from) forgot blunts are tobacco, found out it was actually filled with tobacco anyway, remembered I quit smoking gave it back. I don't think its something that will restart my withdrawal, barely inhaled anything, but I'm still pretty pissed.

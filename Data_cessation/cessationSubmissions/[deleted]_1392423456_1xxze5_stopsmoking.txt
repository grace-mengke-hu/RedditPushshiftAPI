I'm going to quit...

I've been smoking since at least 1993. I have 3 cartons left of EU smokes. Delivery of out of the country smokes has become hit and miss these days and I know this shit is bad for me. I do not want to spend the cash on US smokes and frankly, I think I'm in a place were I can give this a try.

I'm down to about a smoke an hour (5am to 8pm). Driving is my biggest thing. I need to smoke, maybe every 10-15 minutes.  I've read that cutting down isn't a good way to go about it, but forbidding myself a smoke unless it's been one hour since the last in the car has worked out great so far.  

I'm trying to keep the same thing going out of the car, but it's a bit difficult. I find myself looking at the clock, waiting for 1 hour to come up so I can smoke. 

My thought process is to finish the stash I have (I really hate to waste money) and when it's done, that's it.. No mas. 

I've ordered some altoids sugar-free mints with the thought that the sensation of inhaling the strong mint will help with the oral and lung sensations.

Any thoughts or recommendations would be more than welcome.

Thanks guys.

One month down!

Just wanted to tell someone that I'm proud of myself for going one month without. I'm abroad right now and WILL return a nonsmoker and have it be a surprise to friends and family so this is me telling someone because i have that giddy proud feeling on the inside.  Even last night I spent an hour on a smoke deck talking to a girl and didn't smoke one! So keep going guys, you can do it if i can!

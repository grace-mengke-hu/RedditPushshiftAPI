First few steps

Hey guys, I'm new to the subreddit and I've quit smoking today. I had my last cigarette about one hour ago and I have high hopes for how this can turn out.

I quit drinking 4th December 2013 and I haven't looked back since, that's how I know I can do this. Drinking had a really big hold on my life, much more than smoking ever did and now I've made the biggest change I'm ready to tackle the smaller things so I can become the person that I want to be. 

I've got a nicotine mouth-spray on hand if it becomes too much, I threw away all of my lighters and cigarettes and now I'm officially a non-smoker. I'm not planning to use the mouth spray and I'm just going to cold turkey the whole journey.

Reading this subreddit is really good motivation to keep going. Thanks everyone.

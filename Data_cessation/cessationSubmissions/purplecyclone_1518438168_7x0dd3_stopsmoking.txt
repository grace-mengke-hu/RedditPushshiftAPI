First day of stopping JUUL

I have tried quitting before, but this time has been the most serious. I'm welcome here if I'm trying to quit a vape and not smoking right? Shits still addictive cause you can do it anywhere no problem.

Everything is so fucking irritating. I just wanna go to sleep, but I'm at school right now. Threw my juul in a bag in a bush yesterday. I got this.

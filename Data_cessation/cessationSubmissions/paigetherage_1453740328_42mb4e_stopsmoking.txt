How to keep the momentum?

After the initial 3 days, I felt over the moon after I quit smoking -- I had more energy, I felt confident... I felt *high*, almost. How that I'm on day 25, I'm wondering if anyone has advice about how to keep the momentum after the initial surge of awesome feelings has subsided! Thanks, guys!

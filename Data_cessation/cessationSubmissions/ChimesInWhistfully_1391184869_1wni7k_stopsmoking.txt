25 hours

When I had a cigarette at 3pm yesterday after work the thought of it being my last one did not enter my mind, despite all the times before when I'd told myself "this one is the last". Thing is, if I do this right, then that 3pm 30th Jan 2014 cig could well be my last one. 

I feel like I can do it this time, whereas with previous attempts I've never had that conviction. It's not like I can go on smoking the rest of my life, so I have to stop some time. No time like the present, right?

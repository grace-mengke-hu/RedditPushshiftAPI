Truths So Far

It's been 34 days (almost) since I had a cigarette.

-Cigarette smoke STINKS. And the older the stench, the stinkier it is. Some things will FOREVER retain the smell- get rid of them (if you can). I had an old vehicle that stunk to high heaven- bought an odor bomb....not so bad now!!
-Exercise, exertion, LIFE is easier now! I can take a HUGE deep breath without sputtering!
-Cravings are less frequent now, but much more fierce when they hit. I know this is mental rather than physical- but my mental strength is what has gotten me this far!!! And occasionally wants to sink me! To push past the crave- I read the health gains on "Smoke Free" that I have achieved thus far....and then I read all the new comments on this subreddit I empathize with "Newbies" (newer than me)- and try to encourage- *YOU* CAN DO THIS!! Then I read the "Old Timers" (farther out than me)- and think- *I* CAN  DO THIS.

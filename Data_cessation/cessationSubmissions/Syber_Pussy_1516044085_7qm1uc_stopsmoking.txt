Tips for avoiding weight gain?

I quit smoking today and was wondering if anyone had any tips to share regarding avoiding weight gain.

In the last 6 months I've gained around 17 pounds so I'm really trying to shed these off simultaneously with quitting tobacco.

With proper diet and exercise will I be able to avoid weight gain?  Or is it just something that happens during the quitting process regardless of diet and exercise?

For reference I've smoked exactly 3 years around 18 tk 20 cigs a day 

Thank you

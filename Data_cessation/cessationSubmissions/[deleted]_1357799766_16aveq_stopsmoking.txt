Moment of weakness.

Sitting at home alone.  Bad day at work.  I think I have seasonal depression.  Don't have a lot of friends... no family living near me.  These are the times when I feel self-destructive.  I've wanted one all day.  Im eyeing my keys.  Gas station is just a couple of blocks away.  Tell me how stupid I am.

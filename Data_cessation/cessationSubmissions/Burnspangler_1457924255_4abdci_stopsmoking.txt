Was quitting easy for anyone ?

It happened two or three times in my five years as a smoker that I completely lost my desire to smoke. No withdrawals, no cravings. It would last a few days, a week, a month one time, and then I'd get drunk, bum a smoke and start again. 

This time I've quit for almost five months now and I don't think its ever coming back. 

Any time I've actually tried to quit I'd last 5 days tops.

I dunno, has anyone else experienced this?

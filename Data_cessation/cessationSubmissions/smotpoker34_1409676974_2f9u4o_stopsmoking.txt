Trying this again

I've tried quitting before and got to almost 6 months before I caved in and let myself go back to my old habits. But now I have a 10 month old to look after and increasingly painful toothaches from smoking so today I've decided, again, enough is enough. I only hope I can make it this time.

Edit: Halfway through day two and I've already fought off a ton of cravings. For some reason its easier this time than the last time I tried quitting...

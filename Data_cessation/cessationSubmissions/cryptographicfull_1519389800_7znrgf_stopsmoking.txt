Smoked my last just now.

Smoked a pack a day for last 12 years. I have quit in the past for 3 months once and twice for 1 month. Really want to push myself this time. Love the support this community has been offering to everyone. 

Lastly, I did not want to make an alt for this because I think it causes us to chicken out.

Today is day 4. No one was murdered on day 3, but there was a close call.

Woke up this morning feeling pretty good. I turned into a cranky asshole last night though and slept on the couch. I felt like Joe Peshi (sp?) on the new snickers commercials. At one point I was reading this forum like a catholic who just committed murder would read the bible. Reading about others successes, trials, and tribulations are a great deterrent for me . 

Day three was the hardest day yet. Day 4 is starting off on a pretty good note. Cheers to not smoking EVER again.

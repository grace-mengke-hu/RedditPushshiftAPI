Round 2

I smoked a pack a day for over 9 years. Last fall I quit and was smoke free til April, when I backslid. Started just smoking when I was drinking, and it progressed from there. I'm sick of the smell and hardly being able to breathe. Today I was smoke free and I would love your guy's support!

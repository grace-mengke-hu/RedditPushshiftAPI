Quitting tomorrow, going to a place I've never smoked.

House sitting for my parents tomorrow, ill be there for a week. I've never smoked at this house so I don't think the routine will be there, it feels like most of the time at home its routine that gets me. Plus my partner is staying here for work (parents live 2 hours away) and he's a smoker with no immediate plans to quit. Hopefully by the time I get back the smell will be disgusting and it won't tempt me. Wish me luck!

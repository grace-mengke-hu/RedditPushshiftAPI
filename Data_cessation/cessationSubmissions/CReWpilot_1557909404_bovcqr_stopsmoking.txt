How I Quit - Cigarettes &gt; Vaping &gt; Gum &gt; (hopefully soon) Nicotine Free

I have lurked here infrequently, but have never really been active. Still though, I thought I might post my experience quitting in case someone might find it useful.
 
Sorry for length.
 
**The Decision to Stop Smoking**
 
Like many (most?), I started smoking in my teens. By college, is was a pack/day habit that I carried well in to my late 30s. I had toyed around with quitting in my early 30s, and even had tried to switch to vaping very briefly, but I never really had the resolve or motivation to truly quit. I knew I *’needed’* to, but didn’t sincerely *’want’* to. Two years ago though, I finally started feeling that I really wanted to quit. As far as what finally pushed me over that edge, it was driven mostly by the fact that I was actually starting to see/feel the impact on my health (high blood pressure, above average resting heart rate, increasingly difficult to do any intense physical activity, intense cough, etc.). I already had a couple vape pens laying around, so I charged them up and decided that tomorrow would be the day.
 
 
**The Switch To Vaping**
 
For day 1, I tried to set a reasonable goal…I simply wanted to get through the day smoking *fewer* cigarettes, but I did not have a set number in mind. In the end, I managed to cut down my normal pack/day to about 10 cigarettes. It wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t horrible either. What surprised me though was even with no change in nicotine, I still craved a cigarette. Vaping was enjoyable, but it was not quite the same. Still, I tried to stick to my plan.
 
For day two, the goal was again, ‘just smoke less’. This time I managed to get it down to about 6 or 7. I was still craving cigarettes, but it wasn’t unbearable. On day 3, I started setting specific goals. I would allow myself 1 cigarette after each meal (my biggest trigger), but only vape beyond that. I think I had to one extra cheat cigarette that day, but I managed to stay to 3 cigarettes for day 4 and 5. Things were going well, so on day 6, I cut down to only having a cigarette after lunch and dinner. Things were looking good so far.
 
Day 7 started good, but became a very discouraging one by the end. I decided to only have a cigarette after dinner and I was actually mostly ok throughout the day. I had a strong cravings after lunch, but just vaped and ignored. It. On the way home, I stopped off at my favorite taco joint and then went outside to smoke and Christ it was good.. This was probably the best cigarette I have ever had. Better than the one you smoke after a long-haul flight. When I got to the end of it, all I wanted was that feeling again. I resisted the urge to smoke another, but I felt really demoralized. I spent the drive home just feeling like I was never going to get rid of that urge. All I could think about was how good that cigarette was and how much I wanted another.
 
Then came Day 8…thank god for day 8. Again, I managed to go all day without smoking, and it wasn’t too bad. I have to admit though, as dinner got closer, I was getting really excited for that after-dinner smoke. The enormous satisfaction from the previous day’s cigarette was still looming large in my head and I wanted to feel that again. I was so excited about it in fact that I ended up eating dinner about 30 minutes earlier than usual just so I could get to it sooner. I scarfed down my food and then went out to my front porch, and lit up, and…yikes. This was not good. It was nothing like the day before. Yes, there was that satisfying rush of nicotine. But, I also just felt nauseous &amp; gross. I was suddenly becoming painfully aware of how sick you feel when smoking. Smoking a pack/day, I guess had gotten numb or accustomed to always feeling that way. But now I was really noticing it…a lot. I barely finished half the cigarette and had a bit of a eureka moment. I was done. At the end of the previous day, I could not wait until my next cigarette. Now, I just wanted these things gone. And they were. I put the cigarette out, went back inside and tossed the remaining pack in the trash. I was done. That was the last time I smoked. I have been tempted a couple times (passing by someone who is smoking right after I’ve eaten a large meal was probably the hardest for several months), but I always thought back to how awful I felt smoking that last cigarette and that usually did the job.
 
 
**Only Vaping**
 
The effects of no longer smoking were pretty noticeable and pretty immediate. Within a month, my resting hear rate dropped by around 10 beats/minute. I wouldn’t actually check it until much later, but my blood pressure was now well back within a normal range. Within 2 months, my smokers cough had also mostly disappeared. I found that my cardiovascular performance was improving as well (still not great, but better). I was only a month in, but I was pretty happy with what I was seeing already.
 
After having found a comfortable nicotine level to vape at, I decided to just let things settle out for a couple more months. I was still worried I would slip back to cigarettes if I fiddled around with things too much, so just wanted to let myself stabilize with vaping a bit more. Once I felt comfortable that I was not going back though, the plan was then to start stepping down nicotine levels until I was hopefully nicotine free. This went reasonably well in the beginning. Every couple weeks I would take another step and found I could make the jumps without much discomfort or cravings. When I got to around 1mg though, I hit a wall. I suddenly started having intense cravings. I tried to push through, but then stepped back up to a higher nicotine level. I let things settle back out and then tried again. I hit the same wall. I repeated this cycle several times over the next 9 months, but never could get below 1 mg/ml and stay there. At a certain point, I just stopped trying to step down. I went to the lowest nicotine level that I could vape at comfortably and stopped there. I was getting a bit frustrated at this point. I had a plan and it wasn’t working. I was glad to be rid of cigarettes, but ultimately wanted to be nicotine free. I just didn’t know how to get there and was really questioning if I truly wanted to quit. Intellectually I did know I wanted to quit, but I was doubting if I really meant it. Feeling demotivated, I kind of just stopped trying to push any further for a while. I was at least healthier than I had been when I was smoking (and it was also costing me much less money), so screw it; I would just stay here for a while.
 
 
The Decision to Stop Vaping
 
I kind of stayed in that demotivated “I’ll just keep vaping” state of mind for about a year. I really didn’t want to follow 20 years of smoking with 20 years of vaping, but I didn’t really have any idea on when &amp; how I would take a step forward towards quitting. But, around 2 years from when I had quit smoking, things started to change. Again, my health was the main driver. Yes, I was healthier now than when I had smoked, but I still wasn’t ‘healthy” and started to notice some old problems coming back. My resting heartrate was starting to increase again. Not to where it was when I smoked, but higher than it had been when I first quit. I also noticed my cough was coming back. Again, it was still not as intense as it was when I smoked, but it was concern nonetheless. My blood pressure is still fine, but I wasn’t going to wait around for that to worsen as well to stop vaping. It was time to finally quit and breath in nothing but fresh air for the first time in 20 years. I still had doubts that I really had enough motivation and a *’sincere enough’* desire to quit, but I was going to try.
 
 
Putting Down the Vape Pen
 
I decided to follow a similar plan to when I stopped smoking. It worked before, so hopefully I could make that strategy work again. This time though I would cut back on vaping by using nicotine gums &amp; mints. Same as before, I took a few days to just ‘vape less’, and then dropped down to ‘only after meals’. Once I got there, I started dropping to two meals and then one, and then finally none. That was just over 2 weeks ago and I have now been free of the vape pen for 4 days. If I’m honest, I don’t think I’ve found quitting vaping to ben any easier than quitting cigarettes. In some ways, qutting vaping has been harder (e.g. the fact that vaping didn’t make me feel sick, so I lack that as a motivator). Like smoking, vaping has been a large part of my life &amp; routine for quite a while now and it’s been hard having that suddenly gone. Even with the gum, the cravings are there. Some are easier to deal with, but there are triggers that are hard to ignore. Hopefully they will lessen so.
 
The journey is still not complete though. I am still on nicotine unfortunately, but am working to phase out the gum/mints (I am trying to use less &amp; less each day). All in all, I can’t really say I feel much better physically yet, I mentally I am very glad to be free of cigarettes and the vape pen. Hopefully I can say I am 100% nicotine free soon.

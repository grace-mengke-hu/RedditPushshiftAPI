Today is day 4

I've made it into the 4th day without smoking!!!

Fucking epic!!!  I'm so proud of myself and so...so fucking grateful for this community!  Seriously...I'm not sure what I would do without you urging me and pushing me to choose health and wellness.  The comments on my posts and the many many private messages...they have made the difference.

So, a few things I've noticed:

 - I can smell!  I can smell all kinds of things!!  This lady passed me this morning at breaky and I literally was overcome how nice she smelled.  Amazing!
 - I am finding myself breathing very deep.  Often while at work I'll stop for a minute or two and just breath deep for a count of 10...in the shower...breath deep for a count of 10...its so nice!  Like little mini- meditations
 - I am cutting bullshit out.  It seems my tolerance for bullshit is falling through the floor.  I just don't care about it....send an email "Heya, I'm sorry, I don't have the bandwidth for X right now.  Thank you so much for keeping me in mind.  Speak soon, SD"...and poof!! the anxiety of that thing is fucking gone.  Not sure how stopping smoking plays into this, but I am attributing it anyway.
 - It seems like my dendrites are reconnecting....my brain is speeding up.  I'm not sure if this is more of a function of not smoking pot or cigs, but its happening none the less.  It's a little scary, to have all of my thoughts alive in brilliant color.  Seems like it will be good for getting things done..
 - I find myself smiling all the fucking time!  I'm so proud of myself :)

Thanks again to this community!  I wouldn't have made it this far without you.

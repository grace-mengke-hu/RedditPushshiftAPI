Quit smoking - lungs and chest feel absolutely wretched. Is this normal?

I quit smoking about a week ago, and lately I've been having trouble getting a full breath. Seems like I have to yawn in order to get a full, deep breath. 

Today it's been horrible though - my lungs feel hot and I can't seem to get a full breath in. Is this normal?

I don't know if I had an alienated condition or something prior to me smoking, but I only smoked for about a month...3 cigs max a day.......and I'm already feeling the conditions of what a lifetime, heaver smoker would feel it seems like. 

Will my breathing get better? Are my lungs just tired and sore? I really need some pep talk here. Also, my lungs seem to feel much worse at night than they do during the day.

24 hours smoke free. Cold turkey. Half pack a day for ~5 years.

My thought process today:

"I want a cigarette. I should go for a walk to get my mind off smoking a cigarette. I want a cigarette. Stop thinking about cigarettes! I'm hungry, but if I eat I know I will want to smoke a cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette." 

UGH!!!!

Right now, I'm failing.

I'm drunk. fifteen minutes ago, i tried to submit a cry for help but my phone wouldn't submit it. now I'm sitting on a bench, smoking and feeling like an utter piece of shit. I know that I won't smoke tomorrow. I know that I'll only smoke when drunk. But Regardless, I think I did fail, didn't I? I mean, it's easy not smoking when sober. But it's spring break right now, I've had 8+ rum &coke and I'm alone. Does that count as a slip? Does smoking drunk count as a slip? I'd make out with the first girl I see, even if I'd find her hideous. But being drunk, everything seems different. i feel like a fucking failure right now. Fuck

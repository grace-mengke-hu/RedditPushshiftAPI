Suggestions on how to get through day one without getting fired?

I'm down to two cigs and I really can't afford more for a few days, waiting on next pay.  Now would be a fantastic time to take the leap and stop smoking.  Any suggestions on how to get through day one without stabbing a coworker, yelling at a customer or losing it on my boss?  I'm essentially in a tele-sales role and so it can get a little stressy from time to time...

Quitting today, best friend moving away

I thought that today would be as good a day as any. One of my best friends and buddies with whom I smoke a good majority of my cigarettes is leaving town for school today. Without him, I won't have anybody to smoke with. Been smoking about a pack a week for five years and I'm done today. Might seem laughable in the eyes of some who have been smoking a lot more for a lot longer. I'm tired of my clothes and breath smelling like cigarettes and I'm tired of the nicotine. Just tired of it all. Bye cigarettes.

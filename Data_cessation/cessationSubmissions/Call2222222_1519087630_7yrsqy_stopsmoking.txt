Quit cigarettes and sugar at the same time. 3.5 days down. Am optimistic but exhausted.

Hello all! This is my first post here, and I am on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting discrepancies.

I have not smoked in 3.5 days, which is officially the longest I have gone without smoking in 15 years. I switched from smoking to vaping, which may be “cheating”, but it’s working well so far.

I have some questions for those who switched from smoking to vaping:
-What side effects good and bad did you notice?
-How long did you wait until you became nicotine free?
-When does this endless exhaustion stop?
-Any other advice/feedback you have to offer about switching from smoking to vaping and eventually quitting is appreciated.

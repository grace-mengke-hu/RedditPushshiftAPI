One week without one cigarette!

Over 1 week so far, pretty damn happy. Hung out with smokers a few times, but not too often, had to decline a few cigarettes which felt great afterwards. Smoking a lot of weed helps, I've replaced the "normal times" I go  out for a cigarette with a bowl for the most part, but now it's getting to the point where I don't even need to replace it at all. All the nicotine has left my body, I don't crave anymore. I do still think of one sometimes after a nice fat bowl, (like I used to), but now I am just teaching myself to be happy with being high (and not off of cigarettes!) 

I can breathe easier, working out again already, and feeling great.

Here's to one week! :)

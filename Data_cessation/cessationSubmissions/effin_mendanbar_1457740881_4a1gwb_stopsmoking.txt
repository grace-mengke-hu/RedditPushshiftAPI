Question about quitting...

First time poster, just have to vent a bit and ask... Why don't they tell you that the irritability doesn't go away? 

I'm sure it does for some, but it hasn't for me. After 5 months, sometimes a craving hits so hard that I turn into a total prick.

Knowing to expect that months ago would have been useful.

Today I slipped, but it was worth it!

Today I was at my cousin's wedding in China, culturally at weddings everytime you smoke you have to offer ciggerettes to everyone around you. So there I was the whole day with people smoking left right and centre and people offering me ciggerettes every half an hour. It is also rude to turn them down as well so I just held onto all of them and later disposed it. Finally I caved in and had one. It was the best thing ever because it made me realise how shit smoking is and how little joy it brings to you. It made me hate ciggerettes even more and will make me think twice before caving in again.

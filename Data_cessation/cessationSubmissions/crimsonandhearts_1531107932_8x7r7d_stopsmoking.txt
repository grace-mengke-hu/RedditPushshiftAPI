Tomorrow will be a week on Chantix

So, I survived my first week on chantix. I must say, I was really scared at first because of everything I heard. I either heard really bad or really good - which strangely, both of those scenarios ended in them quitting. 
Have had no serious side effects - the only one that’s been bothering me is my trouble falling asleep. I’m on my last day of half doses. Tomorrow I take TWO full doses. 

I set my quit day for either the 10th or the 12th. I’m going to shoot for the 10th. The cigarettes are starting to taste strange, not horrible, but strange. I’m also starting to feel like they’re not doing anything for me anymore. They’re not satisfying me as much, most cigarettes I won’t even fully finish. But I’m down to less than half a pack in a week! I’m already feeling better.  I didn’t think I could even cut down to less than half a pack. I was a chain smoker. I love chain smoking especially when I’m bored and on my days off and when I drink. I’m crossing my fingers and can’t wait to be smoke free. Never thought I’d say that. 

Hopefully someone cares to read these, lol. I’m hoping someone who comes across this subreddit and is interested in chantix and is nervous, maybe can feel a little better or make a decision whether or not to take it. If you don’t like these, I apologize. Lol.

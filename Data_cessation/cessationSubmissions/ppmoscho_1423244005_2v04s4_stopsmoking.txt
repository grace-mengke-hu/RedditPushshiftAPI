So i'm now 5 hours shy of the 5 day mark.... Its getting harder and harder....

I have been meaning to stop smoking for years now. 
I started smoking when i was in my mid teens... lets say 16 or 17 something like that. My father smoked, that didnt bother me at least i dont think so... but more importantly my brother smoked... and i wanted to be cool like him. So i started too.

Now its been... 17 years... (wow!) .... anyhow... Ive been with my fience for over 10 years... she liked the bad ass in me when i smoked. however now getting to mature parts in our lives she begged me to stop smoking. Begging turned into nagging... nagging made me smoke more... it was a vicious cycle of just smoking to get away from stress or get away from anything.

SO!... i was in costco and i dont know what got into me but ive been talking about quiting for about a month... then i saw some spray nicorrett thing and decided to try it. I bought it on sunday and started it on monday night... let me finish my last pack i said.

Now its been 5 days.... using th spray thing was weird i thought so i do it secretly... im open about quitting but secretly spray a little whatever once in a while.

It makes me cravings go away. Yet i find myself kind of ... like i dont know what to do with myself. I no longer go outside and have those smoke talks with my buddy... i no longer smoke in the car on my way to and from virtually anywhere... no longer smoke and just relax and do nothing just feeling that sensation of my first smoke of the day.

I find myself very full of so much more time not knowing what to do with myself. So i downloaded this app... "Smoke free". It has time calculations, $ savings etc etc.... There are tasks... one of which was to come here and read about others successes... and whatnot... so i logged in with my long time inactive account and decided to join. Lets see what happens.

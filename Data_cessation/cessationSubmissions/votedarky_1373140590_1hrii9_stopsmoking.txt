Quit smoking today, would like a few helpful tips and I will update my experience as I go.

I am 18 years old and have only been smoking for 3 years. I smoke about half a pack a day, sometimes more sometimes less. I've tried to quit several times and have always failed and fallen back into the habit. Today at 3:20 I lit my last cigarette and tossed the rest. I don't want this habit to dictate my life and my mood any longer, and I definitely don't want any of the negative effects. I've had non-stop smokers cough for at least half a year, and I'm fed up. If anybody has any good tips on how to keep myself from succumbing to the addiction again, it would be much appreciated.

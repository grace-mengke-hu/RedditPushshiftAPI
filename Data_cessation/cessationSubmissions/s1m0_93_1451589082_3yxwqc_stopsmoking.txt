It's my turn to stop. Any ex-smoker singer?

Yesterday I decided to stop smoking. I am not a heavy smoker, but I definitely can't resist when I go out with friends, especially while drinking something. 
Of course I am doing it for my health, but the main reason is that I want to improve my singing so this is a mandatory step.

I was wondering if there is any smoker that noticed relevant improvements after quitting smoke.

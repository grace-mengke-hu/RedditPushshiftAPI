I need help

I’ve been smoking for ten years now, I can feel my lungs starting to deteriorate, my chest hurts a lot, I’m 23 and I feel so unhealthy, I can barely exercise without my chest hurting.. but I can’t seem to put the cigs down and I honestly just don’t know where to start. It feels kinda scary. I normally have about 5 a day. I just need to stop, does anyone have any tips for beginners? The thing I fear most is the low moods and stuff as I’m a generally anxious person anyway.

Relapse?

2 Weeks in, the new year resolution was working on me, until today when randomly I found 2 cigerettes in my apartment, left by the last tenants. I wasnt having cravingss until then but I proceeded to smoke the 2 cigerettes just cuz they were there. Im pretty sure Im not gonna get a pack and smoke it, but should I still reset my app and everything and start from day 0? Im pretty positive Im not gonna smoke.

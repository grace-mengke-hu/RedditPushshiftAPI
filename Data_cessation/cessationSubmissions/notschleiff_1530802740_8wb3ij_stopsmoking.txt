2nd day, not handling the withdrawal symptoms very well no matter how I distract myself.Any advice?

As post says, I’ve decided to quit smoking for good because I wanted to save my long term health and be a better influence for my gfs child. I decided to try cold turkey once again for the 2nd time, and I have not been handling it well. For the past two days I have done nothing but sleep, and I can’t seem to concentrate on anything, even the simplest tasks like making breakfast. I’ve been told to distract myself with things I enjoy/hobbies, but I still have extremely bad cravings. I almost relapsed today and was going to buy a pack of JUUL pods, but realized I have no money to spend on them. Is there any other coping strategies or other things I can apply to my life to get through this period of time? Thanks!

Quitting smoking for the first time

Hey everyone,

First time posting here, the last cigarette I had was December 13, been almost a month since I smoked. Just wondering if anyone had any tips, or experiences going through with it. Still feeling a bit tense lately, being stuck because of the snow doesn't help. 

Anyways, just wanted to introduce myself. Hope to hear from you guys soon.

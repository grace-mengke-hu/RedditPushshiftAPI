Day 3 without smoking.. and it obviously sucks.

Redditor before, first time here.

I think this the first time in 12 years that i'm smoke free.. i've been a heavy lung abuser for that time. Smoking joints, cigarettes/rolling tabocco.
The reason for stopping is simple.. For a while now I feel the consequences bad and like everybody, i don't want to die way too early because of smoking!! 

I stopped smoking weed 6 months ago (fairly easy) because i was travelling the world, well i still am actually! 

But the cigarette is a different story! I just love my cigarette! IN the morning coffee, the late night beer and so on.. It's a (strange) love that only a smoker knows and non smokers can't relate. 

Anyway, I'm sure i want to quit for good this time (tried before, but not really convinced)

I want to ask some advise from people who have gone true this:

So this is day 3 and i'm doing ok-ish, but i'm sure that in a few days, maybe longer, the danger period comes of slacking with the determination and relapse is easier i guess? 

Good tips are welcome!

And i'm sure someone here has/had a GF/BF/SO that didn't smoke and can't relate and takes it so lightly, the support is mild and it makes me grumpy.. well that and a nicotine shortage ;) 

Anyway i'm having a little trouble now, so it's good to just speak my mind.

Tnx for reading and listening!

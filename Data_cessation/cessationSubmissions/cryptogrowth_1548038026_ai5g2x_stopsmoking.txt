#046 - Ive quit twice before. Both times for 45 days. Yesterday all I wanted to do was smoke. The brain really knows how to play with reality. Maybe it is our reality. Either way, stay calm, trust the process and all the other cliches work wonders sometimes. Oh BTW didnt smoke! 16yr record broken!!!

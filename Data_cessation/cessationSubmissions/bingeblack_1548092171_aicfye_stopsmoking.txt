21 days!

I don't know how I've made it this far but I am on 21 days smoke free today. Although I'm happy that I'm here, I am also every afraid. I don't have any cravings. I don't want to smoke at all even when I see someone smoking. I'm pretty sure it's the same for everyone after 21 days. How does relapse happen if there's no craving? Why do people pick the habit again? I'd like to know so I'm prepared and on guard.

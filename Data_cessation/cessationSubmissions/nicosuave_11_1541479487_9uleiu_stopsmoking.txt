Day 5, 3rd time quitting. Today was rough. Need to vent.

I have smoked off and on for 4 or 5 years. I have quit for large periods of time in the past (almost a year) but started up again when it’s introduced to me in a social setting. I switched to vaping in February and became even more addicted to that! I lost my vape on Halloween and figured it was my exit sign. I went out of town with family, so that kept me busy for a while, but now I’m back home. This is the first time I’ve really struggled with quitting. I do feel better, but I have imagined getting in the car and buying a new one multiple times today. I even looked to see if my mom still had hers, couldn’t find it, so I chewed and sucked through a Twizzler. That seemed to help. I have a couple of friends who know I’m quitting that I call my cheerleaders and I’ll text them if I need their support. I guess I’m on here looking for more cheerleaders. I’m also willing to be all of yours :)

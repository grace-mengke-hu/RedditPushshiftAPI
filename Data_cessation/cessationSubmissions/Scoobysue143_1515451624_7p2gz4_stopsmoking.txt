Day one.

First day. Crazy how many triggers I have noticed. Every time I finish a task I feel like I “deserve” a cigarette because that’s how I have lived for so long. Trying to take that thinking and turn it upside down - why do I deserve a cigarette?  What is the reward in that? Etc. 
Having a place to come to vent and watch others be successful helps. Thank you.

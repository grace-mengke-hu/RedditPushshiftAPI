Quitted smoking original cigarettes a month ago and started smoking IQOS, now I want to take a bigger step

Hello,

As the post says, I was a lifelong smoker of 30-35 cigarettes per day, and now I have managed to smoke only IQOS for a month but I think that's not an accomplishment. I really want to quit completely so I'm not sure what should I do next. I've tried cold turkey dozens of times and failed every time.

So I have a few questions now for you, masters of willpower:

What methods worked the best for you when cold turkey failed?

Has anyone transitioned from original cigarettes to IQOS and then quitted? If so, how did you do it?

Also, how good are nicotine patches? I was thinking on moving on them and then quitting.

Keep on the good fight lads!

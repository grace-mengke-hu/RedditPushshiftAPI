Tomorrow is my quit day! I'm nervous and scared, but I'm ready to get back on track!

I've tried quitting a couple of times this year already, but they were very impulsive decisions where I would have no real plan to quit, but I've been preparing myself for the past few weeks for this day (this day being tomorrow).

I've been a smoker on and off for the past seven years. The longest I quit for was in 2011 when I picked up running. That lasted until the summer of 2012 and have since started smoking and subsequently made that an excuse to stop running. Not only have I relapsed in smoking but I also gained 20 lbs back from the 40 that I lost in 2011. 

I want to run again and I want to be in shape again. I know that a lot of smokers run too, and do it well, but I could never get myself to do it and would use the excuse: "I just smoked a cigarette, I have to wait a bit for my lungs to feel a little better" but then I would smoke another cigarette again. It all sounds like flimsy excuses, and they are, but I want there to be no excuse.

I have an e-cig lying around from when I attempted to stop earlier on this year, and they seem to be working fine, but I'm not sure whether or not I should use them. I might just keep it around in case the cravings get *bad*. The last time I quit I did fine with gum, water, and exercise. 

Wish me luck, r/stopsmoking. Thank you for existing!

My last 14.

I'm down to 14 smokes; I've been spacing them out as long as I can. I'm tempted to bring them all outside and smoke them all, hold them in until I can ghost it, and get as sick as I can. What's the point of spreading them out? I've stopped using quite a few other substances just because I took too much and got seriously sick and fucked up, so maybe it would work with cigarettes. I'll decide after I'm good and buzzed. Whoever reads this, thanks. This post may seem pointless since I haven't technically quit yet, but I need to vent. It feels like these last several smokes are a short road leading over a cliff. Its going to be a fucking long fall, but I know theres a soft fuzzy pillow at the bottom.

Today I quit...again. So tired of this rollercoaster of anxiety.

I started smoking socially in college and smoked in and off for quite a while after...maybe half a pack a day. I’ve always had problems with anxiety and depression and truly felt like cigarettes were the crutch I needed to cope with the symptoms of physical anxiety...which I know isn’t true. 

I actually quit a few years ago, for about a year, and then in a moment of weakness bought a pack on a really shitty day...which was a completely stupid maneuver as I got hooked right away again and was up to a pack a day these last few months. 

Just turned 30, know it’s time to be done with this crap and find different ways to address my anxiety. 

Ironically my anxiety often manifests as health anxiety (hypochondria) yet I continued with a habit for so long that I knew would make my health worse. How much sense does that make?? I’m tired feeling like a cigarette will calm my nerves, only to feel overwhelming panic and disgust each time I buy a new pack, thinking cancer or other serious problems are right around the corner for me. 

I’m tired of hiding the whole charade from my friends and family and the ritual of “de-smoking” myself if I think I’m going to come in contact with anyone I know. 

Tired of having no energy and being constantly tight in the chest and coughing. 

This time I’m trying with lozenges on hand although I’m going to try not to use them unless I feel completely crawling out of my skin...

Most worried about cravings while driving as I LOVED to smoke while driving. 

Thanks for reading, it helps to write all of this down while I’m sitting here wanting to go out on my deck and light up...this sub has been pretty inspirational and especially because I don’t want to share this with anyone I know...

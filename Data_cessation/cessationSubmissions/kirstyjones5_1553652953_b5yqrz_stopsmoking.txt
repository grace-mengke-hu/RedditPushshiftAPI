One upside of trying to quit smoking young is that I have a new appreciation of spicy and healthy food

Before I’d avoid healthy food like the plague and gain weight and feel like shit, further contributing to a reason for me to smoke to keep off weight, but now that I finally realize the to some extent how bad it really is for my health I don’t want to keep on doing it and I want to be able to experience as much as I can that I’ve taken for granted, but can’t do that if I’m dead or dying of mouth cancer.

I want to quit smoking and would like some advice!

Hey everyone, I would like some advice on quitting smoking. I've been smoking for 8 years, since I was about 15. For the first few years it was just a couple on the weekends, but naturally it has just gotten worse and worse. Now, I am looking to improve my health all round, finally lose some weight and start saving money. I'm a masters student and the stress is really getting to me but when I smoked a 19 pack in well under 24 hours yesterday I realized I need to stop and now. I've tried so many times to quit, used lollipops and vaporizers and fun "achievement" apps and I just don't know what to do. I could use really some advice!!

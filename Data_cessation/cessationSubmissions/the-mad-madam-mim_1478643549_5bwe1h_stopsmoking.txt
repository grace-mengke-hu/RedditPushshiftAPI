get an expensive e cigarette

been smoking 13 years, never been able to quit for more than a few hours. I have Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and this makes me prone to addiction. Bought an expensive e cigarette last week and honestly it's better than cigarettes. The best part is that powerful e cigarettes work better with low amounts of nicotine in the liquid, over the last week the addiction has become way less intense.

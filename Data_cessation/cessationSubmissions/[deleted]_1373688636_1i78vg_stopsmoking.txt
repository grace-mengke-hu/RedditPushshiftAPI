It's all in the attitude.

I read Allen Carr's book per your advice. The writing was really terrible, which he acknowledged, but I really respected the fact that the book was clearly written to get you excited about quitting. I was excited, and I think I still am a little bit. I think it's been around 5 days, which is longer than I've gone before voluntarily. I don't really want to keep count. I just want to be a non-smoker, but that's beside the point. I don't know if I'm done forever. I'd love to say that when I said I was never going to smoke again it was with everlasting conviction, but that's impossible to know. I don't fear failure though. If I'm not smoking right now, then that's fine with me. If I start smoking again, it's somewhere down the line, and I can deal with it then. At the very least, I can say I've done something. I can say I haven't sat back lazily and let the fuckers kill me without putting up a fight. Anyway, a little rant helps put the mind at ease before bed. Hope you all are doing well. You'll never know how deeply you've helped me.

PS.

Sometimes I dream about smoking. This doesn't bother me. The fear I feel when I'm dreaming and the relief right after I've woken up only reminds me I've made the right decision.

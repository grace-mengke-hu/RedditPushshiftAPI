OW YEAH!! Almost a month. I once had a 500 day badge... love spending my money on expensive coffees instead!

so glad to be done with cigarettes again. i slipped up. had my fun. but im done for good. 

The 2 things that made me be afraid of ever even thinking of touching a cigarette are...

1- turns out the death rate is 60% (prove me wrong)
2- the other one million reasons we all repeat again and again... ive posted it so many times.

and this video. someone posted it here and i cant get enough of it. a very well made short film about addiction. great soundtrack too.

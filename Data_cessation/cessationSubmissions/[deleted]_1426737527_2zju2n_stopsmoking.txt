I didn't realize til now, but six months (and a day) without smokes

Since about the past two days, I have been not really "craving" a smoke but wanting to just "hold a cigarette in my hand and smoke it", if that makes a difference. I hope you understand what I mean...

Not smoking has probably been the best thing I've done since I have started smoking. Not smoking has been beneficial for every aspect of my life. Not smoking is 100% better than smoking.

This shit needs to end.

Hello, all! I am 21 years old, and have been somking for 5 years now; but I want that to stop. I hate having the monkey on my back, and going out in the rain or cold, just to not be craving it. Like going outside in -30 degrees Celsius?? WTF! 

With that being said, I don't have money for the patch but I really want to stop this terrible habit. I have all the normal triggers, like drinking, and smoking pot. 

My question: what are some effective ways to quit cold turkey? I keep trying the money-svaing reminder, but it is not always effective. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

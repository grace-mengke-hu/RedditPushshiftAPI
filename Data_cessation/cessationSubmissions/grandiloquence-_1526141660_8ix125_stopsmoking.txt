My body is falling apart

I quit smoking 24 days ago now, and while it has gone shockingly well mentally (hardly ever crave, even when I drink), my body seems to be falling apart.

I'm coughing more than ever, I'm having dizzy spells, and my throat has been so sore that I went to the doctor to get checked for strep throat. She couldn't find anything wrong with me. I even think I've started snoring, which I've never done in the past decade of smoking!

What the hell? Has anyone else experienced this kind of complete breakdown THIS long after quitting? Or should I go back to the doctor and make her run some more tests?

Relapse after 5 months

16 here... So I quit smoking for 5 months, I quit right after a friend of mine left for southern Ohio (I live in the north). He was my best friend and my link, I guess to smoking. He got me into it and I only smoked when he was around.

But he came back yesterday and I smoked a whole pack. Out of no where that was alarming, I didn't even cough or anything expected after quitting for a long time. 

To say the least I'm disappointed in myself and him actually for saying 'lets go have a smoke' but it was my fault I took him up.

I know I'll always be addicted to nicotine but I don't really see it as an addiction as long as he isn't around. And getting him out of the picture isn't an option, so nicotine has to go.

EDIT: I guess I just needed to get this off of my chest, thanks for the support and suggestions

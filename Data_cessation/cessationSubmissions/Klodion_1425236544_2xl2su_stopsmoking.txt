Quit On New Year's Eve - 2 Months Complete.

My life has changed completely. I am extremely thankful for all of the support that has been given here on /r/StopSmoking, and I congratulate everyone on their streaks! It'd be great if more NYE quitters came forward and shared their experiences too. 

Quitting smoking has led to such a better quality of life that it's unbelievable, I genuinely feel like i'm in debt to some of you guys.

Join me in not smoking today!

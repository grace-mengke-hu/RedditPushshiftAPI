Quitting Vaping but no Withdrawal Symptoms?

Hi, I have not vaped in 42 hours at this point. Prior to this I vaped or smoked everyday for 5 years. The weird thing is I’m not having any withdrawal symptoms. I slept like 12 hours last night and had a small headache but a coffee and ibuprofen fixed it. Also I crave a vape but it’s very light like I find myself thinking about it under 10 times a day.  No insomnia, no anxiety, physical problems, or psychological problems. 

Why is my nicotine withdrawal so light?

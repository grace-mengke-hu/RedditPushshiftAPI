Vaping helped me quit smoking but im tired of being addicted, just tossed my juul and I feel liberated.

Vaping seeps into your life because it can be done anytime anywhere. It was also having side effects that i didnt experience from smoking such as dehydration and anxiety. Ive been addicted to nicotine for years, ive done away with cigs for good, now its vaping.

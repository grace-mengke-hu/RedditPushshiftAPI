Three days no smoking!

I've smoked for 13 years and at least a pack a day for 7. Ran my first 5k this last weekend, after huffing and puffing my way through it I decided to quit. Day one was terrible, tried the patch but didn't like how it made me feel. Went cold turkey instead. Day two and three have been a bit better, although I've kind of a giant asshole. Yelling at my dog and roommate over stupid shit, I hate it. Any tips on getting through the bitchiness?

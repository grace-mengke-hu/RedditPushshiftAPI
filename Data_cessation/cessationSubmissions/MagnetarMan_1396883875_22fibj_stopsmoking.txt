"There is nothing worse than an ex smoker"

How should I approach friends and family members who have not quit smoking yet?  Should I offer unsolicited advice?  Where is the line between being a supportive friend / sibling / child / parent and being too insistent about how great it is to be a non smoker?

If I remember correctly from when I smoked, any advice about quitting went in one ear and out the other.

Any success stories?

Advice on helping a friend

Hi r/stopsmoking!

I had a close friend do the Allan Carr method for quitting a week ago, and last night while drunk he had a cigarette for the first time in a week. 

I've never been a smoker so I don't really know what he's going through. Can other people offer advice about the best way to support my friend in quitting? 

What did other people do that helped you? 

What ways did people try and help that didn't help at all? 

Thanks!

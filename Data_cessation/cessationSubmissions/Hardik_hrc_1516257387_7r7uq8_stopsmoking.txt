I fucking did it, fuck that cancer stick

I am about 10 days smoke free. Smoked 2 packs of camel a day for 7 years and gosh I fucking loved it but my body didn't. I started seeing the signs that I am coughing irregularly and being on the east coast when the winter got pretty bad I started smoking indoors, luckily my roommates are pretty chill even though they for sure hated it but that killed me inside and I decided "fuck this" and now I am cold turkey for 10 days. 

First 3 days are ridiculous, shit man my hands are shivering every second I am thinking just one won't hurt goddamn it but I stayed indoors and just did not allow myself to break. After day 4 I think the headache and body vibrations went away. Now, when I go out I still think about borrowing one from someone on the road but then I quickly distract my mind onto something else and it honestly hasn't been that tough. 

If you are thinking of quitting smoking, honest to god I am one of the weakest person with the most addictive personality you will find in your life, if I can quit so can you. If you need help, I got my friend to quit with me and he used Vape with nicotine juices and it is extremely overwhelming so if you are reading this and you need help, pm me I would be more than happy to help.

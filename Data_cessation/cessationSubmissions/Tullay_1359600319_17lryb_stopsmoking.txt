E-Cigs for Quiting Aide?

So I've tried to quit smoking so many times I've really lost count. My most successful attempt was 2 years ago when I quit for 5 weeks with the aide of a patch. I've been smoking regularly for 10 years and I'm 27 now. I've been getting to the point where I'm smoking almost a pack and a half a day. Worse is that now I'm waking up several times throughout the night and smoking a cig when I do. It's really bad and I'm actually really embarrassed about that. So basically I know that this has to stop. And on top of it all I live in NYC where a pack cost $12, so you can imagine how much money I'm wasting. 

Now I've tried patches, gums, cold turkey, and I read Allan Carr's book. None of it seamed to work. In the end I always just want a smoke and I give in. I stopped for 4 days 3 weeks ago but I caved yet again. So I'm wondering if anyone has had any success with e-cigarettes to help themselves quit bc I haven't tried that yet. Also, please let me know any thoughts you have or any tips that have helped you.Thanks everyone!

The easy way to stop smoking.

Hi everyone!
I’m quite new to this sub, and i’m not sure if this kind of thing has been posted previously, but here goes.

I’m currently 22 turning 23 in October, and have been smoke free for about 3-4 months now. I smoked for about 5 years and couldn’t be happier that i’ve kicked it to the curb. Now I know that there are some of you that have smoked for as long as i’ve been alive, but that shouldn’t make it any harder for you to live a happy smoke free life as well. 

The title says it all, quitting smoking is actually very easy and anyone can do it. The method I used to stop was by listening to Alan Carr’s “Easy way to stop smoking”.  Even if you’re not a big reader (like myself) you can find this lovely audiobook online for free. If you’re truly serious about stopping smoking, then I highly advise you give it a read/listen. You’ve got absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain. c:

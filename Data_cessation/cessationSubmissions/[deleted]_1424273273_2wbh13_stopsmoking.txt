Day 26: not smoking today, and I don't even want to! Just an update on the cough

It's getting better, no more coughing and throwing up.  So not COPD then like someone suggested.  Just wanted to let everyone know I am doing better, and to be careful what medical advice you dole out on the 'net.  

Thank you for everyone's continued support.

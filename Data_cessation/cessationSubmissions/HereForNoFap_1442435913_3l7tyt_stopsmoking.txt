6 months smoke free. Just cracked.

Feeling pretty guilty about it.  Not really discouraged or completely off the wagon, but just feel pretty meh about myself for smoking.  

During the past 6 months I've been vaping heavily on 6mg of nicotine and maybe I need to go up?  I know the general progression of quitting is to move down to 0 nic, but smoking helps me with my stress.  Anyways, I don't really want to tell my friends about my failure, so I just wanted to share with people who have felt similarly.

August 29 makes it one year!

August 29 2015 was my last cigarette. It hasn't been the easiest journey, especially those first couple of weeks. But it does get better and there's plenty of moments that make no longer being a smoker feel fantastic. Oh, and the extra money doesn't hurt, either =)

Sometimes I smell it, and still wish I could have one. Sometimes, I wish I had the willpower to be a social smoker who could have one here and there without the worries of an addiction. But I know that's not the case, so I can't risk it. And more times than not, the smell does not come across as appealing to me.

To the others out there trying to quit; keep at it! Listen as your breaths get deeper and fuller. Know that for whatever reason you may find to want to continue, there's so many more good ones to not keep doing it. Wishing all the other quitters all the best!

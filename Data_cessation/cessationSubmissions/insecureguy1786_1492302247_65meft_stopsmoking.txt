Alcohol is a trigger for me

Hi Reddit, after many failed attempts I'm going to try quitting again from tomorrow, very determinate.

My problem is however, that when I start drinking I instantly crave a cigarette, its crazy! I go out drinking and clubbing once a week which makes it hard. 

I also use it as a substitute to weed, since last year I almost got kicked out of college for abusing it and now my house mates smoke it twice a week still, so I just have a fag with them when they do.
Any clue how I should face these problems?

It will never be the "right time" to quit.

Your addicted brain will come up with all kinds of dumbass excuses to put off quitting.

 "oh I'll be drinking at the party this weekend and that'll be triggering, I'll quit after then"

"party was great, now time to quit smoking! Oh, but this week of work will be stressful and the first few days are the hardest, I'll wait until Friday."

"TGIF! but I still have a pack and a half left, I'll finish these and then surely I'll quit."

"okay, finished the last one. But, hmm, it's the 27th today, how about I wait until the 1st? Clean slate, fresh start."

This is literally me over the past couple weeks. Actually it's been me for... Well, I don't even know how long, these are just the recent excuses I can remember. 

I'm so fucking sick of it. I've started working out the past couple weeks and have been wheezing during exercise. 8% of my measly income goes toward cigarettes. I have HIV and while my numbers are good right now, it is imperative that I quit for the long term prognosis of my infection. Literally not a single day goes by that I don't think of quitting and wonder when I'm going to do it. I'm tired of this loop. The "right time" according to an addicted brain will never come... but the REAL right time has always been right now.

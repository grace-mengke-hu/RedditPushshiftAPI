About to hit the one week mark

Six days and 21 hours as of writing this and about to hit the one week mark. Living the life baby. I am actually kind of happier and more confident, cravings, are less severe and i hardly notice them, so yay!! I keep telling myself this mantra. "If I can get over the most addictive drug known to man, I can get over anything". This makes me sound cocky but I have such confidence and self-esteem recently it is unnatural!!! So yeah, this is me :), I am gonna reach the three week mark in no time. I can get out of this filthy habit! I have done much harder things than this. I was sent on this earth to live a happy fulfilled life, and not to be chained to some leaves rolled on paper. I AM BETTER THAN A MOLECULE.

Oh yeah, the reason for this post! Thanks guys, thanks for all the motivation. You guys rock!!!

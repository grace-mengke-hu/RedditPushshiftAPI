Cravings - Are They Always a Thing?

I've been talked to some people who once smoked but no longer do (I do hate the word quit, it implies a degree of failure) about their life after smoking. They've told me that cravings are always a part of their lives, even after many years.

I once smoked (half a pack daily for five years) but no longer do (two weeks) and have still been having some pretty strong cravings. Is this just going to be a thing that I deal with for the rest of my life?

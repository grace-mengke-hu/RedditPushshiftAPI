Today was a cigarette day.

Hi all,

So, as you can see from my badge, I quit tobacco for good over a year ago. Haven't bought a pack in over two years. But today was a cigarette day.

You see, I'm a bartender. And working in the restaurant industry, I'm constantly surrounded by smokers. I'd say 80% of my current co-workers smoke. So I'm constantly around it, but the majority of the time it's not tempting.

Every once in a while though, I have a shift that is so monumentally shitty that absolutely nothing can make me feel better.. except nicotine. The cravings hit me like waves. And eventually I go under. Today, I worked a double. 12 hours, brunch and dinner. Brunch was fine, I drank tons of coffee but it went well. By the time dinner service started, I had crashed. Cue one of the worst shifts I've ever clocked in for. I made an absolute fuckload of mistakes. Even the simplest things, I fucked up. Three hours after I was absolutely fed up, I still wasn't done with my close out. And I couldn't even take a bite to eat with the state I was in. It's really agonizing to admit, but the only thing I knew could help was a cigarette. So I bummed one off my co-worker, went out at the end of the night, and smoked half of it. Only half, I wouldn't allow myself the whole thing. Then I went back inside.

Finally, I could relax. Finally, I could eat a small amount of food. Finally, I could feel kinda normal. This is the third time I've had a cigarette day since I quit. I'm not ashamed of it. I only ever smoke half the cigarette. But I am concerned - that it will start happening more frequently. That I will backslide. That I will become what I used to be.

But nothing else helps on a day like today.

Edit: wow 500+, look at me ma!!!

100 DAYS!

32 years old and I smoked for 18 years. I had a [non-lung] cancer scare at the beginning of 2018, and although I love smoking, I realized that it's just not worth dying for. 
The immense number of tests and waiting for a potential cancer diagnosis was the most stressful 3 months of my life. 
I could not imagine getting a lung cancer diagnosis and regretting every single cigarette I'd ever smoked. I couldn't imagine leaving my loved ones behind because I valued smoking more than I did my life. 
Champix helped immensely and I would recommend it to everyone. I know some people have had crazy reactions to it, but I was lucky enough not to experience anything beyond a bit of nausea. 
I know it's said here all the time, but if I can do it, so can you. 
You're worth more.

Scared to Get Comfortable

Now that the cravings have subsided. I'm really starting to enjoying my non-smoking-ness. On the other hand, I'm scared to death of becoming complacent and getting caught off guard. 

I wanted to quit smoking. I quit smoking now out of fear. The fear has lessened.

What do you use when you get stressed? What self talk do you use?

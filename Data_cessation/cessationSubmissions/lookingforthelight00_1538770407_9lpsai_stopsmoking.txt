Quit for 2 weeks. Just relapsed.

Now I was really happy with quitting. I felt proud that I was successful and doing something great for my body. 

I did start vaping. 0 nicotine. Good juices.

My mod broke down and even though I smoked nicotine free, I guess because of the addiction of “inhaling and exhaling smoke” I could not take it and by the 5h mark had a cigarette in my mouth.

I ordered a new vape. It should be here after a month. Maybe a dumb decision but I decided to change my quit date to when my new vape arrives. 

I believe that I shouldn’t even vape but I would love to vape for about half a year nicotine free and then cut that away too from my life because it’s so so hard for me to quit the cigarettes with out it.

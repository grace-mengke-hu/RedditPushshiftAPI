Day 4: this shit sucks but nowhere near as much as smoking sucked.

It’s been a rollercoaster of easy and hard, and right now it’s hitting me with a hard wave of withdrawal.  But despite that I don’t want a cig.  I hate the withdrawals and how weird they make me feel, but it doesn’t make me want a cig.  I just hope they start subsiding soon but even if they don’t, I’m not gonna go back.  Fuck cigarettes.

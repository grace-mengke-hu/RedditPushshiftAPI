...but in my dreams...

Day 22.

Found myself in my old habits last night -- having a smoke while driving home from work. At the time I couldn't recall why I had started smoking again, or when I had started back up. It wasn't my first cigarette, I knew that much. I was fully back at it again. 

I was really disappointed to find myself smoking. Truly saddened -- a feeling I still have as I type this out. But I was hopeful that it wouldn't be as hard to quit this time since I've already and so recently overcome the lies that I fed myself when quitting.

...and with a small gasp I awake -- so thirsty, mouth completely dry. Reminds me of when I used to smoke. I could never drink enough water to stay hydrated when smoking a pack a day.

Thinking...thinking...when did I smoke? I smell smoke around me, but that's just my Love (who still says she enjoys it).

No, I don't think I did smoke.

It was just another dream.

Check the apps... 21 Days 20 Hours and some change since Noon on 12/31/2016 when I called myself out in the mirror, watching a weak fool tell himself that he'd quit LATER, again. No, you're not quitting at midnight and you know it. You've already smoked your last...

Equally powerful was 8 hours later when Alan Carr tells me to light up a cigarette and I'm all too happy to oblige.

But I realized that I NEVER wanted to do the first 8 hours over again.

And today...I NEVER want to do the first three weeks over again.

And all I have to do is never take another puff.

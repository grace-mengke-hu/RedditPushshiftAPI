Cigarettes are stupid

My boyfriend well best friend, I moved back home for a bit but he’s been my best friend and probably I’m a lucky one for that for so many years does not smoke unless it’s socially. I wish I had that willpower. I definitely use them to cope.  But I feel like when I’m with him I do the same then some and can’t actually stop on a day to day basis. Mornings and nights are worse. Mostly boredom and anxiety crutch but how do I just break it say if I did get back with him. Since I have an addictive relationship with it. And say we did get back together. I think it’s stupid that I’m still doing it when it make my lungs heart so much. I just want to wake up and throughout the day not think about it, do it or feel the pain caused by it. I talk to him and I just feel guilt. And beat myself up for wasting myself over it when I have so many things I should be focusing on instead. It’s holding me back. And I stop start daily which is hella expensive.

You got this

You'll walk past the person that's smoking, and you'll smile, feeling like you're a better person, knowing you made a commitment to yourself to live a healthier life. You'll walk past the store, whereÂ you can break down and buy a pack, but you know this craving will be gone by the time you get 25 steps away from it. You think you'll feel better with just a quick one, but you know that it's going to taste horrible and unfulfilling. The feeling of accomplishment and pride feels so much better than the short lived rush you were hoping to get from a cigarette. You are not weak, you are strong, to the point of being stubborn. Your brain is full of wonderful chemicals that keep you functioning throughout the day, and a measly chemical laced cigarette is no match for the powerful reasoning and shrewdness your brain provides you. And your lungs are cleaning themselves out, as you read this. You control your own mind and body, and you decide what's best for you, not anything else. Be the powerful and in control human being you are always capable of. Stay strong and calm, you got this.

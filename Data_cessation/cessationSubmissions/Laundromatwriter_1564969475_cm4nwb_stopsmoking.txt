I consider myself finally smoke free!

I don’t know how many days it has been because I just randomly decided to quit one day, so far I think it’s been around two weeks. Weird how most of the day you don’t even think about smoking then randomly it will pop in your head like “this is the best idea anyone has had about anything ever, go buy cigarettes.” Then you just have to ignore it for a minute and it all fades away.

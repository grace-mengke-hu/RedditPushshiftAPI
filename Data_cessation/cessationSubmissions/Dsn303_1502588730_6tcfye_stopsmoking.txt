4 months smoke free but...

After 4 months of fighting I'm a bit fed up and really want to smoke. I basically forgot why I quit smoking and why it felt so good when I quit. I though I just need a reminder, so I read all my notes on smoke free app and all the reasons sound like you know, all the reasons why any smoker should quit... it's just hard, even though I thought it's gonna be easier over time - It is not! It actually feels like maintaining what you achieved so far, or rather trying not to fuck it up. It's 2:40am and I can't sleep cos I'm so excited about my day at work, which is silly lol and when I think about work it reminds me about all smoking coworkers and that I always belonged to any smoking group, but not this time. Actually writing about it made me realise what's my problem right now. It's me being doubtful that I can make it and it's because of my job.  I'm still on NRT but tried different combinations. I have to admit I'm addicted to it, it feels like I just have to be addicted to anything that leads to some sort of self distraction, I guess. It's not like I think of smoking all the time, I have normal days and enjoy them, but today i reached that critical point in my 'journey' which was coming from 2-3 weeks, when I started feeling I just can't make it any longer. Does it get any better over time?

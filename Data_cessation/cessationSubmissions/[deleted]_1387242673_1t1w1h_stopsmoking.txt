77 Days Without A Cigarette

When I was smoking, I honestly believed that my lungs were so utterly wrecked that they would never be able to recover. I had asthma so bad that I couldn't sleep on my back, had to take Advair and Singulair every day and puff on an inhaler, and I still smoked a pack a day. I was resigned to living my entire life like that, for a while.

Today I ran for a full hour. I set out to do a short run just to see if I could run at all. I hit the 30 minute mark and felt so amazing I just wanted to run and run and run. My body was just *working*. Just doing what it's meant to. Heart beating steadily, breath rising and falling, no pain or discomfort. I'm 30 years old and I haven't felt like that since I was 14. Just the sheer joy of running to feel your heart beat and know that you're alive.

I'm so glad I stopped listening to the lies my cigarette-addicted brain was telling me. I wouldn't trade 10 minutes of that run for a lifetime of cigarettes.

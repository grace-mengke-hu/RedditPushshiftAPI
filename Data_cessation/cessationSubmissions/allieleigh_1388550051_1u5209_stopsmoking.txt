Jumping on the bandwagon...

So I have been sick (sore throat and coughing like crazy) for about 6 days or so and not getting better. My S.O. can recall everytime I've been sick in the last 6 years and how bad it's been. Of course, I would always brush him off for suggesting that cigarettes have something to do with the intensity and duration but something clicked a few days ago as I was smoking, coughing up a lung with tears in my eyes from stuffed sinuses. I've been completely smoke free for a little under 36 hours and I'm slowly starting to feel better. 

I have been thinking about stopping for awhile now and now that I have been smoke-free for this long I just don't see the point in going to buy more and starting up again.

Here we go, guys!!

I know I'm ready but I don't feel ready

I've quit before for a 3 month span, going from a pack and a half a day to nothing.  All it took was a bad day and happening to be around someone who lit up not knowing that I had quit.  I was hooked again.  This time not so severe, I could barely choke down the "light" cigarette and had to ultimately go to "ultra-lights" when I decided to cave in. I'm at half a pack a day and it's been just over a year now.  I'm getting the urge to drop it again due to feeling guilty heading back in to work from breaks and looks I get at restaurant parking lots, but not sure I have the will power to go through those first 3 days/week all over again.  Any suggestions or references for help?

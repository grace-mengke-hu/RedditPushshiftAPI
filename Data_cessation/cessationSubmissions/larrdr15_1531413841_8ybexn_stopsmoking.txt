Hit 48 hour mark and exhausted...

Yellow,

So I decided to quit smoking on Tuesday 7/10. My last cigarette was roughly 11:30 AM. I've just hit the 48 hour mark of no smoking. My cravings go back and forth. Sometimes they can be pretty terrible, other times not. I find that when I'm at work, I'm fine not to take breaks like I used to. When I'm out and about (especially driving) it gets a little more tricky.

I'm facing a bigger issue with my energy levels. The first night I got home I was confined to the couch. Usually I'm pretty active and had recently started going to the gym, but I couldn't find the motivation or energy. Last night I got home a little bit later, but as soon as I was home I was laying down and basically catatonic.  I couldn't even pick up an xbox controller or put away some laundry. Is this all part of the withdrawal from not smoking??

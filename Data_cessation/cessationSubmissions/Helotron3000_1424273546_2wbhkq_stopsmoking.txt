Day ten! And never smoking again!

So I sing in a university level choir, and had my first rehearsal since my quit day last night.  I knew my voice would be better than it had been in a very long time, but I totally did not expect to sound as good as I did!  It felt good for the notes to come easy again.  If anything is motivation to keep going, this is it!

7 day review - Ups, downs and observations

**tl;dr** **- If you haven't stopped yet, just give it a chance and know that the time does pass relatively normally.**

Soooo after about 11 years of 20 per day average, I went cold turkey. A previous attempt had gone extremely well for up to a month until I decided that "I don't care about cigs but I can go ahead and smoke them when I'm drunk", and ended up back on the tar wagon.

This time has been much more difficult, though more constructive. I'm having to think more about not being a smoker and work on the mental tools to remind myself why I don' t need to smoke and the reasons why I'm a non-smoker. Some of the following issues persist:

*  Benefits of not smoking tend to creep up on you and don't have the same immediate impact as smoking does i.e. the instant gratification of nicotine from a cig compared with the couple days it takes for you and your clothes/accommodation to stop smelling like smoke. Moving from a long-term person rather than a instant hit person takes a while, and you'll be surprised how impatient you've become (and possibly spoilt for shoveling cigs at yourself when you wanted them). 

* Social situations are much more enjoyable, simply because you aren't stinking or constantly dodging out side. I'm not stupid, neither would I tend to underestimate things, but you really cannot understand how strongly you smell of smoke until you've been clean for a few days. As soon as people get on public transport, I can tell they smoke and how long ago... it's rancid.

* I've started getting angry at myself for yielding control of my health/time/finances to smoking... it's ridiculous the resources I've ploughed into this. At least with gaming I've a back catalog to show for it and something to bring up in conversation when I meet other people that are into gaming... can't exactly sit and talk about that great smoke you had (let's be honest!).

* In only a week I've saved  40 EUR. That's insane! In one month I'll have saved enough to buy both an amazon prime and netflix annual subscription?!?!?! In two months cracking set of headphones and portable radio to listen to local radio and practice my German language learning. 

**All in all, I'm pleased that I'm here a week later and not staring at my feet and shuffling about on the balcony with a cig in my hand. I'm not ecstatic or suddenly sprouting six pack abs, I'm just calmly sitting here not feeling like warmed up shit any more (which is exactly what it was like knowing that I wanted to stop and didn't). I'll be buying new books every month with my saved money and clogging the shelves rather than my lungs**

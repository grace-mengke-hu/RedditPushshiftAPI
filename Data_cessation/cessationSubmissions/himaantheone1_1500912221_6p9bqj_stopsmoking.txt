Its been almost 3 months after i quit smoking . I can really feel the change

I posted an ama post [2 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/68d1kz/its_been_2_weeks_since_i_have_stopped_smoking_ama/) after i quit. I really didnt think at that time that i can pull it off but now that i have pulled almost 3 months ,i can literally feel my lungs expanding and contracting with joy from the feel of fresh air . It almost feels like when a person that has eyepower experiences clear vision through glasses for the first time except that in my case it feels better every passing day .My stamina has grown exponentially .The cravings have reduced to twice everyday to maximum of twice every week lasting not more than 10 sec - 30 sec . In brief i feel good to be independent again ...

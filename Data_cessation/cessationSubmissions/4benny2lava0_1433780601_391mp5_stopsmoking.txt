Why is it that some days I can smoke a pack and others I can not smoke at all?

Yesterday I had one before bed. Didn't even think about it. I had three today already. Im way down from two weeks ago and just lost My high stress job so it's a perfect opportunity to have an easier time quitting. I'm realizing a lot of inconsistency in craving and withdrawal.

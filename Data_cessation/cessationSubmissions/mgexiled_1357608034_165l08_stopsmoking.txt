I've been smoking for the past seven years. I think it's time to stop. 

Hi Reddit.

I've never asked anyone for help before with quitting. Never used a quit guide, e-cigarettes etc...
My few attempts at quitting had been successful for a couple of weeks but i always end up back on them. There are so many behavioral patterns in play, I've associated smoking with
- Waiting for a train
- Driving
- With a coffee
- Whenever i see some of my family and friends (most of them smoke)

I had quit smoking around November and got sick immediately after. I started smoking again in December and have just recently quit again. And once again i got sick. Ridiculously itchy throat, coughs that feel they are ripping my chest apart and shortness of breath. I hate it and it makes me want to start smoking again.

It's also my birthday at the end of the week and I think i will still be sick then. Damn cigarettes.  

How have others tackled the social side of smoking / patterns?

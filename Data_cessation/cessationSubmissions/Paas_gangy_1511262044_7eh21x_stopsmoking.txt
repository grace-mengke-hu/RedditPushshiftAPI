Waiying for a sign

Edit: Waiting for a sign

I don't know how to put this into words.

I feel like I want to quit, but I keep waiting and pushing back my quiting day.

I didn't stop when my father died nor when my teacher had a brain stroke nor when I catched a flu. 

How do you set a quiting date and stick to it when you want to quit but you don't feel motivated?

Cheers!

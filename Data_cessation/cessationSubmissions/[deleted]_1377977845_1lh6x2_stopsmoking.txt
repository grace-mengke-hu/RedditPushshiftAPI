1st busy night at work since I quit.

I work at an outdoor music venue and also a restaurant and bar (With a majority of the demographic being smokers). I am usually not a server but work in the office area, but due to a co-workers recent injury, I must step up to the plate. Today we have a sold out show and I know work is going to get stressful. Days like these are like HELL- long waits for food and tables, angry patrons, you get it. I'm afraid one little thing will set me off and its no difficult task to find a smoke around there. Send me strong, positive vibes my fellow non-smokers!!!

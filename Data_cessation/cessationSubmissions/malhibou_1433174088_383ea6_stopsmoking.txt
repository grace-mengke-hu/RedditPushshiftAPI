Today is the day!

I've been lurking on here, prepping myself mentally, and here I am. Last cigarette was at 11:09 PM last night, so today is my first smoke-free day. I had a piece of Nicorette gum this morning, but I'm hoping to drop the NRT after a week or two.
Wish me luck! Or at least pray that I don't punch a coworker.
EDIT: 10 to 20 American spirits a day for 8 years. I'm a dancer and I'm not willing to kill myself to stay slim any more.

EDIT: Update from 2 hours later. Sipping juice, pretty snappish and weepy. Oh boy, this is gonna be a long Monday!

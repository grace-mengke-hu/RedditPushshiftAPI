The night before. I will be free.

For years I've had Allen Carr's book laying around the house. Heck, used it as a coaster in my smoking shed. I've tried reading the book a bunch of times, but never seemed to make it much past chapter 25 before I would give a quit attempt a go. Then a few horrible days later I would be smoking again. 

Two years ago I found a sport that I fell in love with (/r/bjj) and it keeps me in such good shape. It seems ridiculous to everyone, myself included, to go roll for two hours and immediately go out for a smoke. Nobody likes to roll with me because I stink and I have this horrible smokers cough. I was thinking to myself: this has to stop. But I can't. What's stopping me?

The book had the answers. This time, I started reading at chapter 25, and everything has clicked. I get it now. This IS stupid. I get absolutely nothing but poison from these things. No pleasure, no relief, just death and decay. I can visualize the monster inside me. I will win this fight. Quitting will be easy and enjoyable because I like winning fights.

Tomorrow morning I will wake up and I will be free.

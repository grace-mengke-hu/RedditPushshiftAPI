Maaadly depressed

Its been 42 hours since I had my last smoke and I remember why I was so terrified about attempting to quit again. 

I feel sooooo down, so empty and so alone... I havent felt this bad in months. What is making it worse is that me and my girlfriend are having a huge fight and it might happen that we end our relationship.

Anyone else struggling with really deep sadness when quitting?

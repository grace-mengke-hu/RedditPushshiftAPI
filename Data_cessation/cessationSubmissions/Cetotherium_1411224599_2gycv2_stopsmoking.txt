Giving cold turkey a shot. Any advice?

I'm sick as a dog this weekend and not working till Monday, so I figure I'll give quitting cold turkey a shot. I generally smoke 20-25 cigarettes a day, and I since I have quite abit of anxiety when I'm not nicotine-deprived, it gets much much worse when I don't smoke. I'm especially concerned about dealing with cravings at work, since I work outside it is so easy to smoke whenever I want, and since I lose my temper so easily when I'm craving cigarettes I'm worried I'll lose my shit and get in trouble or start a fight or something.
When will the cravings subside? I last had a smoke Friday afternoon, will they be better by Monday? How can I deal with the withdrawls without completely losing my shit?

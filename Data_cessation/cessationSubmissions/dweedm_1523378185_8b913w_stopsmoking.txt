Life With a Smoker

One day quit. So far so good after too many attempts this year. My problem is that I live with an unrepentant smoker. There are always cigarettes around. Long butts in the ashtray and smoke in the air. Last time I quit was easy as I didn't live with a smoker and part of what got me through the tough times was that the house was smoke free. Has anyone  successfully quit while living with a smoker? Strategies for those moments of weakness?

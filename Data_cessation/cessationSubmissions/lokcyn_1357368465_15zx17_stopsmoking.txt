Has anyone else tapered off to discontinuation rather than quitting cold turkey?

I have not quit smoking. I started at about age 12 and by 16 smoked a pack per day. By 18 or so (honestly do not recall when) I smoked 2 packs per day. I smoked 2 packs per day until I was about 30. Then I slowed down a bit and smoked a pack a day well into my thirties. Approaching 40, I harped on myself (as did my SO) about quitting and smoked even less... maybe 2 packs over 3 days. Now, at age 40, I find myself smoking, on average, 1 pack over 3 days. I feel myself slowly discontinuing the habit and often times believe that if I continue at this rate and honestly wish to quit I will do so. I ordered Allen Carr's book this evening because I don't really like reading pdf files. Considering my personal experiences with slowly discontinuing and the information everyone here seems to speak of with this book, I see no way I shall not quit in the near future. Has anyone else quit this way (slow discontinuation) or have most of you quit cold-turkey?

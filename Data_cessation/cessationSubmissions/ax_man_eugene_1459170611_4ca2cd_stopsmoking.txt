Today begins my second attempt at quitting.

I tried to quit once before about 8 months ago. I was using Nicorette gum and after a week, I gave in. I have thought about it a lot since then and I know now that the only way I can finally quit is to go cold turkey. I am ready for this and want to improve my health. I am also changing my diet and have started meditating. I am keeping my mind focused on my health and my future.

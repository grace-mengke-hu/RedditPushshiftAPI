Day 20 update

I'm at day 20 now and still struggling somewhat with feelings of sadness/depression. I quit cold turkey and from day 4-16 it wasn't bad at all. Then, I started with this empty feeling. It's been kinda up and down the last few days but I'm trying to take care of myself by drinking plenty of water, getting enough sleep, and getting lots of exercise. I also keep coming back to this sub for encouragement.

Thanks to everyone who posts/comments on this sub. Misery loves company, I guess!

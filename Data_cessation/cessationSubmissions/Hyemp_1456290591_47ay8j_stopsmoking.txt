It has to be real and forever this time.

My 32nd birthday was last week and I was on a bro trip with old college friends in New Orleans drinking and smoking all week long. I got home this past Sunday and for my birthday my wife gave me the greatest gift of all, two pregnancy tests, both positive. I haven't touch a smoke since Sunday night and don't plan to ever again, I'm going to be a dad, not a smoker.

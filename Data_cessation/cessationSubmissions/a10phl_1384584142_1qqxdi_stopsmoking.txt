getting stressed- just need to rant for a second

so I used to chain smoke when I drank. tonight I went out with some friends and had some drinks but not a lot. just found out that I wont be going back to college in January like I thought(and part of the reason for me quitting). I honestly do know what to do and the strangest part is I want to smoke so bad but at the same time I don't even know how to react without going for that walk and getting that smoking while giving myself a peptalk. I don't even know how to encourage myself with out having a smoke.

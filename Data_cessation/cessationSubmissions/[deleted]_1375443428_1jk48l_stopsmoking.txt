Update: Stopping smoking is worth it

So my depression took the better of me for a little while and I ended up questioning my decision of quitting:

I almost caved but didn't. Although I had to visit my nicotine gum stash for the first time.

/u/jefusan posted a reminder for us new quitters about the link of smoking and depression:

I found it most helpful. I realized that as I'm suffering from depression, I can expect some bouts of worsened symptoms and just have to deal with them as they come. Being on bupropion might be a really good thing for me for these reasons.

Today is already a better day. Again, I remember the good reasons of quitting and I can feel good about sticking to them.

Also, thanks for all the people for your replies. They have been really helpful. It's nice to know you're not the only one going through all this.

I'm quitting smoking.

Hi.

I'm new to reddit, I just registered my account to join stopsmoking and I hope this is the right place to post. I'm trying to quit smoking starting today because I really can't afford it, I run out of money every two weeks and I'm also worried about my health. 

I've smoked for 5 years already, about a pack each day, and I never managed to quit smoking more than 2 or 3 days in a row because I start to worry a lot about not having cigarettes.

I hope that if I share my experience with you, it might help overcome this moment. I always smoked while drinking coffee, and it was weird drinking it without smoking when I tried to quit. This time i'm trying to quit both smoking and coffee at the same time, hoping I won't find any other reason to smoke now.

Has any of you tried quitting both coffee and smoking at the same time? How did it turn out?

Thanks for your help :)

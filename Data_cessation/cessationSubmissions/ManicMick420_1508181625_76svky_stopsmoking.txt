How to actually quit, I've done it 155 times...

I am not lying when I say 155 times, tomorrow when I wake up will be 156 the attempts are over a thousand but I did not keep score of that.

First get yourself an eighth of cannabis, joint papers or a bowl. get the universe to line up where you have your last cigarette before bed, this way you don't have any when you wake up.

Next after you wake up, say "Today is the day I quit!" Every time you are craving a cigarette do a bong rip, or smoke a bowl or joint. Give it an hour. Every time you want to smoke have some cannabis. I do not care about smoking cigarettes while under the influence of the Devil's Lettuce. 

If you wake up at 7 am and can make it to 4pm you should be good. The trick is not to smoke cigs that day, and if you make it to bed time without smoking, dreaded day two is easier.

Dreaded Day two:
Everything in life that sucks, is annoying or what have you is coming your way. There will be screaming babies duct taped to a loud vacuum cleaner following you around. you will be stuck in traffic, you will be hostile and agitated. Just smoke cannabis instead during this day too.

Dreaded day three, The craving for nicotine is over and done with but you will see that day three is toughest because something is missing. 

Day 4 you are clear. 

If you can not smoke cannabis, or live in Oaklahoma where once gram is death by hanging or whatever you may want to go to Colorado for the weekend and buy an ounce of whackytobaccy.

I hope this helps you.

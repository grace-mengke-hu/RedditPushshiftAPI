Failed but still felt that this was a victory

Last night I decided to quit smoking. I’ve wanted to quit smoking for awhile but haven’t really even attempted. Although I almost immediately caved I did seriously consider not smoking and now feel guilty. I feel that is a small step in the right direction and will perhaps choose a quit date in the near future.

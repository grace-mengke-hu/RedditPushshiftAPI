do you feel you're close to a relapse? smoke something else instead.

quit months ago. at first it has been hard. now i feel confident that i will never smoke again in the near future (i don't miss that anymore).

that said, sometimes at night (maybe after a drink) the feeling of smoke that flows through your throat is something you really miss. i think that is one of the major cause of relapses more than nicotine: the taste and feel of smoking.

what i do is taking some herbal teas, roll it in a cigarette and smoke one. it doesn't give you anything (maybe it just shows you how stupid is smoking), you are still harming yourself, but you're staying away from nicotine and avoided a relapse without effort and without thinking you're giving away a part of you and other bullshits people who quit sometimes think about.

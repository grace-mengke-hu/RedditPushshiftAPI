Does "vaping" an eCig count as not smoking cigarettes?

So I am expecting a daughter in December and figured that I should quit now for her health and for mine.  My wife bought me a really cool Vision eCig to help me quit.  Does switching to an eCig, with the intent of quitting, count as quitting?  Or, is quitting cigarettes defined as abstaining from nicotine all together?

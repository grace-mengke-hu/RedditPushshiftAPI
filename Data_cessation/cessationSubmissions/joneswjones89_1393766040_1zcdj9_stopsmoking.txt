On the road to quitting: 4 days in, don't lose sight of your motivation

I had my last cigarette at 9.15pm on Feb 26. So writing this, I've been smoke free for about 4 days and 12 or so hours.

I started smoking when I was about 15 and now I'm almost 25. The smoking has escalated into being a 20-a-day smoker and I took it upon myself to say enough is enough, it's time to give up on what is one of my favourite pass times. 

Trust me, I love smoking! Smoking with beers, with coffee, after a meal, while walking the dog, sitting on the beach, waiting for a bus, they're all just some of the most opportune smoking moments. However, quitting is the right thing to do and I have the right motivation. 

When I figured out how much money I could save, it was a no brainer beacause the health benefits have never appealed to me for some reason. It's still really hard and I still want to smoke but there's my mantra, "THE WORLD CUP", I repeat it to myself and every time I get a craving I think of how sweet it will be to be in Sao Paulo in July watching history unfold. 

I used to think that the way to quit something was to replace it with something else. When I quit smoking dope I replaced it with alcohol, not my brightest idea. What I have now learnt is that if you sincerely want to do something, you will do it. I always tell myself, just stop, how hard is it to stop putting smokes in your mouth?! That's working to. I also tell myself that I can do anything that I put my mind to, and I am strong. Being positive is really helping.

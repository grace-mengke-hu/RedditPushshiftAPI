Day 1...

Been up for a couple hours now.
Dropped the kids off at the school bus.
Came home and sat outside for freah air...
(Threw away everything that had to do with cigarettes, astrays, papers, lighters)
 So... i see a half butt that i missed sweeping up last night after my "last smoke".
its still there... 
I should tell my wife... 
Her determination and sheer will power is stronger than mine...
not ashamed to admit it also, maybe, maybe she can throw it away over the edge for me...

To think I've been smoking since i was 14, I'm now 38...
24years of smoking...
Litterally MORE than half my life...

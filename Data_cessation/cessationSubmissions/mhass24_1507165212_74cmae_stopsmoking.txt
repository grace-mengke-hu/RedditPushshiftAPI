Sudden craving after 6 months of abstinence. What do you think?

I quit cold turkey in March. Even gave advice to people on this sub a few times. Thought I was done. For the last three days however, I've been having the WORST post-dinner cravings ever. Today I caved in and bought a pack of ultra lights (usually only smoked Dunhills). Came home and started looking up why this is happening. 

Then I found [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2902924/) which says that prolonged cravings after 6 months are UNHEARD of. I'm assuming they consider a prolonged craving to be one that never went away, and mine went away almost a month after I quit, so I don't really understand what is happening right now.

I was wondering if any of you have experienced something similar and obviously I'm just gonna smoke one now because I already bought the pack, but how would you recommend going about dealing with it later?

Sorry for the wall of text.


**Update**: This is disgusting. It smells like ass. I should have gone running instead.

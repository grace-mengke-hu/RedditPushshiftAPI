need help..

im 18, i quit smoking on new years.. cold turkey, i dont have any cravings, i feel its so easy but, i just woke up yesterday, went to my basketball game, i suddenly cant shoot properly, i thought it was just a bad day, today again.. same thing.. is this because of quitting smoking? is my mind feeling lazy due to quitting? all of a sudden no matter how much i warm up i cant get it right.. is this because of quitting?.. thanks reddit

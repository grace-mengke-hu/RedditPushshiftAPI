Proud of each day, they somehow add up both quickly and slowly. Can anyone relate to sicknesses? 2 months in I was diagnosed with strep throat, as soon as I finished antibiotics I started a new job in a super dusty environment with kids and developed the longest most mucusy cold of my life. I've never experienced so much snot can anybody relate to this? Feels good to be cleaning out my lungs but also so gross.

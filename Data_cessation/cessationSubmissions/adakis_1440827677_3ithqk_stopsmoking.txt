This fucking sucks

I just got married recently. I never considered myself a real smoker, but I would have one or two cigarettes before bed every night. I started not liking the way I felt in the morning, and my wife hated me smoking so I am trying to quit. It is much harder than I expected it to be. I want a reason to go outside for five minutes. I want to breath something in in the dark of the summer night. I want to sit on my porch. Why can't I just sit on my porch without smoking? It just doesn't feel the same. It's difficult.

Edit: Thanks for the comments. I made it through the night without smoking. In the bright light of morning I'm so glad I didn't give in, but it was not easy. Now I'm on day 3. I hear it's a doozy.

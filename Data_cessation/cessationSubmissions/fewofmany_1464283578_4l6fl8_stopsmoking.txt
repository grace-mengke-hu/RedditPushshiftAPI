What was I thinking when I picked up smoking?

About a year ago I did something dumb. I started smoking. The reason? I always (used to) tell people to quit smoking, all the time. That they had no excuse not to. After all, it's just willpower, right? Well, I didn't know for sure, and I figured that if I really wanted to have any idea what I was asking people to do, I should probably experience it for myself. So I started smoking for the sole purpose of trying to quit. It wasn't particularly difficult to pick up, I had smoked maybe one cigarette a year up to that point.

I had initially intended to quit once I suspected I was hooked. Brilliant, I know. But then, I was hooked. I quit for all of two days, and then realized exactly how much I had come to depend on this habit. It was a regular break from life. A stress reducer. A reason to go talk to people. It wasn't easy to even want to quit. I mean, yeah, I'd probably die if I didn't, and be poorer, but those were easy thoughts to quell with a nice cig break.

I still don't know if I want to quit. Some extra money would be nice. But most of all, this persistent tightness in my chest has got to go. It's been a year, I'm ready to complete the purpose of this experiment. I need to quit. I just wish naive past me were here to lecture me and keep me on track.

tl;dr: started smoking a year ago just to see what it would be like to quit. quitting now and dreading it.

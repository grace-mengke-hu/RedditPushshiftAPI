Have Ultimate Frisbee Tournament Tomorrow (5 hours of running) and Have Craving...

It's totally illogical. I've been clean five months now, and am feeling amazing, physically. I'm about to run my ass off tomorrow. Last time I tried to do this, I was smoking, and I vomited all over the sideline a half an hour into the first game.

There's no good reason to smoke. I will not smoke.

But something about this lazy summer Friday is just getting my brain cooking. I'm sitting around the house alone, and thought about going out and getting a pack of smokes and sitting on my porch and just chowing down. 

Why??? 

I'm an addict. I won't do it. But I feel shitty and anxious for turning away again, for some reason, today. I wanted to share this with this forum that's been so helpful for me these past five months. It doesn't make any sense, but that's why everyone posts here. Thanks for the help everyone, and here's one more day.

Most days, thankfully, I don't even think about it. But today I can taste it.

smoking and bad news

I quit this december for 9 days but after i learned about some bad news related to my sisters health i started again. My 35 year old sister, a smoker since 16, was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this July. We hoped we would get some time before things get worse but it seems this time has become much shorter. Everytime i go to her place and watch her suffer from pains i feel like being punched in the stomach. I return home and i turn to smoking for comfort. But i find none. I know this will be my fate too if i don't quit but this addiction always makes me believe it is my only comfort when there is only worse and worse news everyday. In the past i managed to stay smoke free for 5 months but i turned to it again as a self medication for my psychological problems which arose from some bad news again. This is my pattern, when bad news knock on the door i hide behind smoking. This time im trying to quit again from Monday. Im saying Monday because tommorow im going to be reading Carrs book again. i know very well that i must not view quitting as a sacrifice but as a gift to my future self, but still i wonder and fear how i am going to pull through with the difficult road ahead ...

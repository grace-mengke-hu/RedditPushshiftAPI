I need to stop (needing advice and motivation)

I am addicted, I know I'm addicted, but I can't stop. I was never a pack day smoker, at most 10 cigs a day. I hate the fact I am tie down to this addiction, and I can really use the mental help. 

I'm going to attempt to stop now. 

I have discipline in a lot of areas in my life, just not this one. I went on ketogenic diet for 12 weeks straight, I was in the Army for 6 years, and wake up ridiculous hours for work at my school. 

If you guys can give me your personal stories or any advice on quitting, please feel free to share.

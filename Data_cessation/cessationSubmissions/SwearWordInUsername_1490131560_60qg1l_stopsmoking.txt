Just randomly made the decision to quit

I record myself talking after work as like a voice journal and said "i should quit smoking" then said "ok, fuck it. Im going to quit smoking". But im going to buy a carton of cigarettes first, then quit after the last pack. 

I did that before and lasted 4 months. So, here we go again. Ill pop in for support and stuff if that's ok, when i actually do quit. Should be a week or two. 

Any thoughts? Or words of advice?

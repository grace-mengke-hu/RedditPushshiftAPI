Quitting after about 15 years, need help!

Started smoking in High School, around 14 years ago.  Tried quitting once or twice in the past with no luck.  Got an ECig which is working well, but all I can think about is having a cig.  My Fiance has gotten me things like mints, sunflower seeds etc..  

I am also currently trying to eat better and exercise, as I am not in the greatest shape either.  I feel like trying to do everything at once, something is going to fall through on me.  Looking for advice, different tactics, anything at all really that may help me along my journey for a healthier lifestyle.

Thanks in advance!

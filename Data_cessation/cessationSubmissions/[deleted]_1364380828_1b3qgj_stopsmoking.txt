So my smoking dream happened...

I smoked not one, but two cigarettes. I then had another dream where I stole something from a thrift store in Boston and the police were waiting for me outside. Woke up from that one like, "wheew at least THAT was a dream, but I can't believe I smoked those cigarettes!" Took a minute or two to realize that one was a dream too. It's weird how convinced I was it was real. I was really freaked out and disappointed in myself. Weird start to the morning. It's seemed like, in general, I've been remembering my dreams WAY more since I quit. Anyone else have a similar thing happen?

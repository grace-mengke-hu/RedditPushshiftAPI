I had just one puff

I did it mostly because I was with friends, they where doing something new (a new type of hashish) and I really wanted to try it. Anyway I was super drunk, really happy and decided to have just one puff. I know all about the law of addiction which says that one puff is all you need to re-establish an addiction. Anyway, it's been two days since that puff and i'm sitting in bed, feeling like shit, feeling addicted again, almost 80 days in and i feel like i'm on day 2. What an idiot!!! Of course I will never start smoking, these 80 days have been the best of my life, it's a shame i put it all at risk for a puff of a joint. I could have had a pure joint and not feel shitty for a week.

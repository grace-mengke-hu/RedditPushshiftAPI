Today's my first day as a non-smoker.

I've been smoking for 10+ years. I've chosen today as my quit date and I'm honoring the commitment. 
The day's more than half over for me. The day's been tougher than I thought it would. I've had this relatively mild feeling like I have soda fizzing in my brain. Weird.

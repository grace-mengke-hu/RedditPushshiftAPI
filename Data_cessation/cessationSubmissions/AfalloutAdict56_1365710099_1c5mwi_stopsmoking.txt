Trying to kick it for good this time...

I started smoking this summer, and yeah, I know that it is such a small amount of time but I found myself quickly up to almost a pack a day.  The biggest problem I've had with trying to quit is that it because second nature to sit down , start my car and light up a cig... Over the past few months I've managed to narrow it down to only driving , and this past friday I gave my pack to my roommate and am trying to fight the urge to buy another.  The only time I want one is after work.. I am a waiter, and sometimes I leave feeling stressed all to hell and I get anxiety so a cig would stop it...Anyways, here's to 6 days smoke free. Sorry if I talked too much, figured I'd introduce myself and what not..

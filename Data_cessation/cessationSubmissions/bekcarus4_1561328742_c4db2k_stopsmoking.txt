Advice on anxiety and quitting

Hey longtime smoker and longtime person with depression anxiety. 
Started smoking years ago during a sequence of life altering events, to my shame I did not realize that I was was smoking to curb symptoms of my chronic anxiety and depression until I was much older.  Over the years I have quit twice for a period of 2 years each, but now I need it to be permanent.  I had been going strong for 11 days no smoking, no nicotine but had several anxiety attacks compounded by other life. 

Anyone else out there have depression/anxiety/dysthymia and successfully quit? If so, do you have any advice for safe, productive, non-medication solutions to help.  Shit knowing it has been done before will even help. Let me know how you are, that you did it.

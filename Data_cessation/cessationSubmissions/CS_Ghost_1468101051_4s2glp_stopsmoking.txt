Nicotine replacement therapy, Quited[4-5 Days]

Hello, I've quited smoking for about 4-5 days now (I don't really keep track) and i'm using nicotine replacements in particular the nicorette quick mist.

It's actually quit easy to quit with this even tho I was addicted for 7 years started at the age of 15.

Anyway I'd like to know how healthy the actual replacement therapy is and how bad the ingredients are in the list:

Nicotine(obviously)
propylene glycol, anhydrous ethanol,
trometamol, poloxamer 407, glycerol, sodium hydrogen carbonate, levomenthol, mint flavour, cooling
flavour, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, hydrochloric acid and purified water.

I'm also getting a little dizzy and have some blurred vision was wondering if these go away after a while?

Thank you for the read, hope someone can help me with these questions.

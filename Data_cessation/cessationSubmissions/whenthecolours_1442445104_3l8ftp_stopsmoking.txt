The Best Unsubscribe Ever

Hello stopsmoking,

Was scrolling through my subreddits and stumbled upon this one. I am unsubscribing to the subreddit because I've been four months smokefree with not the least bit of a desire to smoke.

Flashback to four months ago, the third time I had tried to quit smoking after three years of smoking. I read the different threads on this subreddit, marveling at those who had been smokefree for weeks...month...YEARS. It seemed unfathomable, and my then shaking hands clicked subscribe, knowing that I would crack within a day or two. I told my boyfriend he wasn't allowed to see me that weekend, because I'd definitely rip his head off. A week passed. My face started breaking out with whiteheads, a sign that the chemicals were being ejected from my system. I started to be able to smell. I started to be able to taste.

Now, months later, the days of cravings seem like a very distant memory. Smoke-free, high-energy, clear skinned. Hang in there, reddit buddies, and one day, you'll be able to unsubscribe too.

EDIT: Thank you to all of you who commented. Sticking around to help those who recently quit, and the rest of you who have stuck around are definitely an inspiration to old/new quitters alike. Does that mean I should change the thread's title to THE BEST UN-UNSUBSCRIBE EVER?

need help for my sick mother.

She is 61 has smoked since she was 18. she was to get a surgery but Dr's said her heart was too much at risk to try it. Has had emphysema 2 times last year both month long. My sister and i badger her when she smokes all the time. These are the methods she has tried. 
Chantix lasted 3 weeks and started smoking again
hypnosis lasted 3 weeks and started smoking again
cold turkey 2 weeks
vape pen 3x's almost a month before going back
i would use my entire life savings to get her to stop
she says she wants to stop, she wants to be around for her 5 year old grandchild. I know ultimately the decision is up to her will power but her will power sucks!! i dont want to just stand by as she kills herself.
Anyone in the same position have feedback they could offer to get her to quit? i see how some of these ciggerette companies try to have people quit but do they really mean it?

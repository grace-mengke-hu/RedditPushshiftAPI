First long haul flight since quitting

My husband and I are on our first long haul flight since we quit smoking. Car ride to O'hare and 3-ish hours sitting in the airport so far, plus an 8 hour flight, two hour layover and another 3 hour flight on the other side. It is SO liberating to not stress about going in and out through security/did I remember smokes and/or lighter from the security bin/do I have enough time to go before the plane boards/do I have enough money for duty free cartons.

We can truly sit back and relax!!!!

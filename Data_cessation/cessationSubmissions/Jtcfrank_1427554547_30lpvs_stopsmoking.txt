Going out for the first time tonight!

I'm going out for the for the first time since I quit smoking ( Freed myself from slavery) for me best friend's birthday. I'm kind of nervous, but also excited at the same time. This is where I  usually cave in and smoke, but I  know I can do this without smoking!

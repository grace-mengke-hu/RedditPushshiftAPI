Girl friend gets sulky every time I fail.

Ah guys I keep failing with my quitting after as little as 24 hours.  It's bumming me out and making it harder to not give up trying. 


Edit:  massive thanks for the messages guys was feeling pretty low.  Friday is crunch day again, won't be going back to work for 4 weeks.  So hoping being away from temptation and what I hope Is only support from my SO.  Will be reading carr's book during this time.

I'm weaning myself (over 30 year habit). I have questions about side effects.

My headache just WON'T ease up! I went from about a pack and a half a day to 15 on the first, minus one a day. Now at 10 a day. The headache is REAL. 
I'm also eating a ton &amp; drinking a ton of fluids (non alcoholic), but that can be managed. The headache is killing me and I'm still using nicotine.
Is this normal?

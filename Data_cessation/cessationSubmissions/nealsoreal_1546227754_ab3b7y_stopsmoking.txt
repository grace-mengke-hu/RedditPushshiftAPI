Made the decision to permanently quit yesterday. I've already relapsed. Need support.

I started smoking when I was 17 and now I'm 20. Over the past few months, the idea of quitting has been in the back of my mind, and I've made attempts to quit by myself but always came back to smoking. But yesterday, I made the decision to quit once and for all, after my mom found one of my packs and I told her I'm ready to quit but I need help. I had all this motivation to quit after that but I blew it already. I can't take any more of this. It's not worth it anymore and I want to be free. It doesn't bring me joy like it used to, it's caused so much turmoil in my family and ruined my relationship with my mom who has kicked me out 3 times for catching me smoking. Yesterday something snapped in me and I realized that I need to quit and I'm finally ready to ask for help and support because I don't want to live like this anymore. I hate the way I smell disgusting and feel disgusting after I smoke and I can feel my health getting worse every time I smoke. Enough is enough.

I tried to go cold turkey and couldn't even last a single day. I smoked 3 cigarettes during the day, so I researched tips on quitting and took notes, planned out what to do when I get cravings, and set a goal for myself to not smoke for 24 hours. By the end of the day, the craving was so strong that I just caved and smoked 3 cigarettes in a row. After that, I texted my dad and told him I need help, I asked him to take me to CVS to get some patches and gum. I'm making an appointment with a doctor too. I know that's a big step in the right direction, but I still feel so awful and disgusted with myself after smoking those cigarettes.

I need all the tips, all the support, and all the motivation I can get. After that horrible relapse, I am feeling so many things and none of them are pleasant. What feels the worst is that I let myself down. I was so excited about quitting and healing my body and freeing myself and I couldn't even last a single day. It's hard not to hate myself for that. I'm not going to give up because of this, but I feel so low right now.

I just want to be free.

I feel like shit. My number went from 8 back to 1 today :(

I'm finding it difficult to do this while stranded in the middle of the ocean on a warship! I had a rough day today and a friend offered me a cig, I said yes because that little demon inside me was saying "Do it! You want this! It will make things better!" and guess what? IT DID, for all of about 5 minutes then back to normal. I definitely regret it. Im starting my banner back over today. 

I had to vent somewhere, and this has been my goto quit smoking place.

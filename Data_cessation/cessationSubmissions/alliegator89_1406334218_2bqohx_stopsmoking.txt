Screaming match in my head.

I feel like there is a screaming match in my head...

"I need to smoke!"
"No you don't! You've come so far"
"But pleeaaasseeeeeee!!!  Just one won't hurt!!"
"IT IS NEVER JUST ONE.  You've been down this road before.  Just one puff, just one cig, just one pack.  It is never JUST ONE."

Meanwhile, the sane part of my brain is trying to study for the GRE in 3 short weeks.  I'm worried I picked a bad time to quit.

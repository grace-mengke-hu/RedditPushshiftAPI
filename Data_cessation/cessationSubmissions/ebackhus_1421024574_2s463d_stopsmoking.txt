Just over a week quit, started vaping on Thursday

and I enjoy it! I found that my addiction is not so much the nicotine but the action of smoking. Thursday I visited a vape shop and bought a pen for myself and for the wife (She quit Thursday). We're both on 6mg nicotine and she wants to know how we can halve it. Most shops here carry them in jumps of 6. I told her I can get a 0mg bottle and split what she has. I'm super glad she's quitting (she's smoked since she was 12 and will be 30 in a few weeks) and I'll do anything to help her. She likes the pen and likes the flavor of fluid I got her (Cappucino since she's a coffe-holic) and I encourage her every day. I'm also telling her how much we've saved so far!

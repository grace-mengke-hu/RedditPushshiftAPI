My final vice

So, I've been smoking for, I think, 6 years. I don't even really know, as I've been partysmoking before that. And my smoking habit is quite odd. Quite shameful actually. I bum cigarettes. All the fucking time. I think I do so, since I've never wanted to take the final step and buy packs, except for parties. That way, I could avoid admitting to myself that I was an actual smoker. Pretty sad. So that leaves me on an average estimate of 5 cigarettes per day for the last 6 years. I must have bummed from thousands of people. Currently, I'm an intern at an embassy, so now I'm bumming from diplomats and people in suits. wtf. I started for real in the army, bumming from soldiers. At the time, the cigarettes seemed like a help, some existential fuck you to the situation (was in Helmand). But I feel more and more that they are simply an obstacle to who I want to be. I have an image of myself in the future, as many of you do as well, a fit, non-smoking productive me, spending time on what is relevant, job, families and hobbies. It's been a process. I have succesfully quit gaming, porn and now all that is left is smoking. And friends, I've realized that they are all three to a large extent simply procrastination enablers. They postpone our necessary choices and let us indulge in introvertness, thus prohibiting our personal development. We only live once, so a waste of time. Cigarettes with the added benefit that it shortens your life too. Fuck cigarettes. Smoking is pointless. Well it does do one thing, it's starting to fuck up my teeth a bit. Sorry for the rant, I needed to make it official, today I'm quitting. Wish me luck.

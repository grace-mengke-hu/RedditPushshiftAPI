Day four!

I'm on my fourth day of no smoking. I just looked at the app I'm using, and it says I've officially not smoked four packs of cigarettes as of right now. The last couple of days were rough, but I feel like I'm over a bit of a hump. Yesterday, I started a pretty intense workout at the gym, and I was able to actually think objectively about my cravings after it. It's the first time I've ever been able to say to myself, "Hey, I'm having a craving. But if I ignore it, just like I do that itch on my knee, it'll go away in a couple minutes." Why haven't I been able to do that before??

"Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times." Mark Twain

I know exactly what old Samuel 'Mark Twain' Clemens meant. I have quit smoking time after time for anywhere from 3 days to 3 months. I have no idea how many times I've tried at this point. 

Still, I'm quitting this time. I truly believe it. I just can't keep doing this for my money nor health. My family has a history of heart conditions and I know if I kept smoking I would develop them as well. I'm on the patch and I haven't had a puff of smoke since July 21st (2014). Here's to being smoke free! Wish me luck!

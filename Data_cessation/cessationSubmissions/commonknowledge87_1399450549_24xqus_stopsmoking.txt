Starting to stop

So i have been fighting bronchitis and i started coughing up blood because a tore the lining in my throat. I told myself if i dont stop when im coughing up blood then i will never stop, this was 8 days ago and a quit smoking cold turkey. I am actually doing very well and pretty proud of myself even if its only been 8 days. This is the longest i have gone without in a smoke in 9 years. So far my cure has been jolly ranchers believe it or not, i pop one in every time i want a smoke and next thing you know i forget about it because im so focused and these damn sweet candies lol. Just thought i would share my story so far.

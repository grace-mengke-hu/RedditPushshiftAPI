I'm three months in to not smoking. Thanks guys.

Now I'm 3 months into quitting and after the first few weeks things really got better. I still smoke electronic cigarettes, but I get the liquid that doesn't have nicotine. Still counts as quitting, right?

I still have dreams I smoke, so those kind of suck. But Honestly I feel better. Now i just need to get my ass up and go to the gym.

I lurked on this sub to try and get motivation to quit, and it was one post that really made it sunk it I wish i remember who it was so i can thank him/her. 

Just letting you guys know that this sub was really the main driving force to quitting and staying quit.

There should be a natural law or something that when ever a person tries to quit smoking they have like, the worst week ever trying to push them back.

Allen cars easy way on YouTube

Hey guys I was talking to another user in this subreddit and shared this link with him.
I read Allen cars book to quit and so far itâ€™s been going pretty good for me. 
But one other thing I did was listen to this every night bit by bit while falling asleep.

Just wanted to share he link with you guys. Perhaps if people here are hesitant to go out and buy the book they can check it out here instead. Hope this helps someone!!

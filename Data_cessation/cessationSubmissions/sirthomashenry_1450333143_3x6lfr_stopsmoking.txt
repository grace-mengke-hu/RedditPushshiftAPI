Does anyone else feel like two different people?

First let me say, I am almost 4 weeks off cigarettes (my flair is being updated).  

I was a varsity athlete in high school. I love exercise.  I love how I feel when I get in the rhythm and go to the gym 5 days a week.  I like a runner's high.  I like lifting weights.  I love healthy food.

I started smoking my senior year of high school.  Almost immediately,  I had a love for cigarettes.  Loved them with beer, loved them with coffee.  

I even worked at a gym shortly after college, but hid the fact I smoked cigarettes (though I think they knew).  I was ashamed of that side of me - they knew the person that cared about my health and enjoyed the outdoors.  They didn't know the person that started the day with a cup of coffee and went home to have a few beers and chain smoke after work.  

I still feel this way.  I am so excited to be almost 4 months without a cigarette.  I smell a smoker and I'm reminded why I quit.  But I see a smoker leave the bar to go have a smoke and I miss it.  I miss drinking coffee and chain smoking.  

Does anyone else feel like they go to two extremes?

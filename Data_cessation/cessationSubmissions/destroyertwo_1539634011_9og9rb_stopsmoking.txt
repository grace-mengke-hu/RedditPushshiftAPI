I want to quit.

So I'm new here. I have been smoking for about 3 years now at one point I smoked about 3-5 packs a day. Now i am at 1 every few days, but that's not enough I want to quit. I don't want this horrible habit for the rest of my life. I'm hoping that you guys could give me some tips on how to quit I've tried a few things and I tried cold turkey but I haven't been able to stick to it. Please help me out.

Just over five years.

I read the book and I quit like a lot of people on this sub-Reddit. 

The best piece of advice I can give is, you quit nicotine, not cigarettes, hookah, ect.. You quit nicotine. I have made sure I haven't slipped up once. 

I tried quitting over 15 times in the 21 years I was a smoker. It finally caught when I was officially ready. I didn't quit on my target age but I still did it. You can do it too just keep trying. Every one less cigarette, vape, hooka, or whatever your nicotine vice is, it's one step closer to a longer life :)

Day one and desperate to quit

I'm trying again.

Last time I managed to quit for 7 years. One day I just stopped. I started again 18 months ago and I'm struggling. I desparatly want to quit but I don't seem to be able to last one day. Hoping some accountability will help.

So today is day one. Technically still hour one. I really want to do it this time.

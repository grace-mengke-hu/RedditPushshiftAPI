I want to quit and then every now and again smoke socially.

I've quit smoking. It's been a couple of days and it's been tough at times but overall not that bad. I don't know if it'll get easier or harder as I progress but I'll tough it out.
The problem is that I want to socially smoke with my friends. I see them a couple evenings a month so I think I'll be alright, but I've known people that have quit, tried to socially smoke and gone right back to smoking full time. 
At the same time I know people that used to smoke a bunch, quit and now only have a smoke when they're with friends and it's fine.

Anyone either side of this fence have an advice?

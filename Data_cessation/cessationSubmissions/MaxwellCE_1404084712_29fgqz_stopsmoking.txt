It's done. I'm free.

I had very recently finished reading Allen Carr's book, and I just finished watching the [DVD that you can find on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2KbMsJ9a4w) (posted here on /r/stopsmoking just a few days ago).

It's about time. I was thinking to myself, this is like winning the lottery, but soon realised how wrong I was. No amount of money from winning the lottery can do what escaping smoking will do for me. Who am I going to give money to, to make this aching feeling in my lungs go away? How much do I have to pay to stop myself from gasping for air when I'm trying to sleep? To not have to look to this unsociable 'habit' when I'm feeling even just a tad anxious?

Nothing. In fact, I was paying crazy amounts of money to MAINTAIN these problems. Until my financial senses finds its new balance, I'm effectively being PAID to feel awesome. 

I'm free.

19 years old and I'm fed up.

Hey guys, I'm kind of new to reddit, so please forgive me if I break any rules or something like that

I fell into the trap whenever I was 17. Started smoking then and have barely looked back. I'm just so ridiculously tired of paying for cigs! I am trying to start my own business, and cigarettes are the main cause of my slow progress. I smoked a pack a day up until today. I don't want to do it anymore. I started using those nicotine patches, and so far, i haven't had a real craving yet. Of course I am going to ween myself off the patches, but as for now, I really just need some advice. What do I do whenever I get that craving? As a little self motivator, I have an app that counts down every second that I haven't had a cigarette. It's called "QuitIt" Anybody have any success with using an app for accountability? Any words of advice or words of wisdom? Thanks guys!

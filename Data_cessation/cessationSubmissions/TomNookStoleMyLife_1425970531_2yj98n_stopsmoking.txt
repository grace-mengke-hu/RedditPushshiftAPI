Lost my appetite for smokes after +3 a day for a year and a half.

I started up smoking when I began my (messy) relationship with my (kind of) ex about a year and a half ago. I used to be 3 or 4 cigarettes a weekend, only when I was around him because he smoked, keeping a pack for a month or so, but then I got two jobs and the stress led me to smoke that amount in a day. 

After a weekend of binge drinking with the ex (and we all know alcohol is nicotine's BFF) and a messy fight where I smoked all of mine and like 5 or 6 cigs bummed off some buddies, I went to get a pack today, smoked one, and after two puffs threw it out the window.

I think in realizing how shitty my ex made me feel I kind of realized how shitty smoking actually made me feel. And because I'm working on having a healthier lifestyle I know smoking can't be a part of that. Just made me feel really good that after trying to stop and failing I think this is going to be it. I know it's going to be tough but I think if I make it a part of kicking out all other negative things in my life (like my ex) I can do this. 

Idk, might be wishful thinking-- thanks for reading though and good luck to you all!

The battle begins.

I want to thank everyone for their successes and struggles they've put on here.  I tried to stop before,  but this time isn't so bad.  

I'm only at 18 hours with no nicotine, but it feels different.  My want to not smoke has actually outweighed the urge to light up.  

My only real question here is,  what are some random things to do to keep my hands busy during times when a cigarette could easily be there? 

Thanks again to all of you wonderful people;  you've inspired me and motivate me to do this now.

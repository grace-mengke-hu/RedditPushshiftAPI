Oh my god I'm so bummed today!

Started smoking 15 years ago, when I was 12 years old.  I had my last cigarette yesterday morning.  Yesterday wasn't too bad, today though, ugh!  I expected to be irritable, moody, angry whatever.  I even expected the panic (I feel like someone is sitting on my chest, I can't breathe!)  But at least that feeling comes and goes.  What I didn't expect was this soul crushing sadness.  I am SO FREAKING BUMMED.  I've been just crying at the drop of a hat, all day.  Is that just me?  Will I feel less lethargic and depressed in a few days?  How long can this agony last?

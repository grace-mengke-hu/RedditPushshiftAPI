There's 6 left in the pack, and I'm done.

Recently, I moved cross country for a new job, taking quite a pay cut in the process.  I've been following my expenses a bit more closely as a result, and while it's unfortunate for Phillip-Morris, I think it's finally time to reclaim the $250 a month or so I'm wasting on small paper tubes full of dead plants that light on fire.

So I guess this is officially hour 1.

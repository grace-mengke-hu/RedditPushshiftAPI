Roomate's half-smoke lying around for days... had to do something about it

One of my roomates smoke... and for some reason, a half-smoked cigarette has been on top of the microwave in the kitchen for days.  Every time I've been in the kitchen, I see it, and frankly, drool just a little bit over it in my mind.  Alot of times I've had to give myself a 4 or 5 minute talking-to about how it won't just be that half a smoke, I'll end up smoking full-blown for months or years, I'll be broke again, blah blah blah...

But after seeing it for days, and having it attack my mind and tempt me, I suddenly just ripped it to shreds, ran the tobacco under the tap, and threw it in the garbage.

I have to be smart about this.  I'm a recovering tobacco addict.  I can't deal with a tasty juicy looking smoke tempting me 3 or 4 times a day every time I go into the kitchen.  It's just dangerous.

So I'm good now.  Crisis averted, haha

Keep it up people, Merry Christmas!!

Some impressions after six months and change (freehand)

It's a scary and lonely walk, quitting that sh*t, but it's absolutely worth it. 

You are quitting something that is not only awful for your health, but also totally dominant upon you. The thing is, it is not a walk in the park but IT SHOULD BE. 

You're just ditching an addiction that kills slowly, downgrades your quality of life, and which you were never going to understand anyway. 

There's no explanation for the stupidity of smoking cigarettes. Addiction is very difficult to understand.

My advice: stay quit, most of the horror will definitely pass in time. 

Remember: the addiction was just not justifiable, pure compulsion, total fear of what life really seems to be: a scary, anxiety-ridden, void. 

You need to create yourself, to be the architect of your own narrative, not a Fu*king slave.

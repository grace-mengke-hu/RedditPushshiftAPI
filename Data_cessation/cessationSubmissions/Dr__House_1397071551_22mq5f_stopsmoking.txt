Day 2: Feeling Better Already

I can already feel the craving to smoke lessening. Kind of like the nicotine has realized that it has finally lost the war and its giving in. 

Yesterday, Day1, was a haze. It was brutal. I could feel every second go by. Today is Day 2 and I'm already feeling much better than I did yesterday.

Breathing is easier *already*. This is shocking.

First day!

I have been smoking for 12 years. Almost made it 24 hours cold turky. I have been reading this subreddit all week for motivation. This time I will succeed! 

Does anyone know if there are any legitimate ways to speed up nicotine withdrawel? I have seen things saying to exercise, take vitiman C, drink lots of water, and take various supplements. Has anyone on here had luck with anything like that?

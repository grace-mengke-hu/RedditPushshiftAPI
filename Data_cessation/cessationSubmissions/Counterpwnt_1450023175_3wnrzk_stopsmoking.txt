Two weeks!

This is the longest I've gone in 8 years! I had no idea the extent of my addiction until now. It's not nearly as "casual" as I always thought. It's deeply intertwined with my ability to feel and process genuine emotion, my ability to savor the moment, to engage. This probably wasn't always the case, but between short bouts of withdrawal depression I feel surprisingly calm, thankful, and just really dang pumped to be alive. This is great!

Thanks to the whole sub for helping me get through 14 days of cold turkey. I know it's an ongoing fight, but I feel like I'm winning!

Trying to take the next step.

Hey, I'm just wondering if anyone knows if there is a free version of the easy way to quit smoking book anywhere online? I've cut down quite a bit and trying to take the next step after my sister recently quit and told me the book had helped her an insane amount. The stupid cigarettes help keep me from being able to purchase it myself. 

Thanks in advance.

Victory! I drank without a cigarette!

I went to an office "happy hour" where nobody really smokes anyways,  so usually I toss back the free booze and then stealthily locate a place in the parking lot to light up.

See I dont really know most of the people there, and the double whammy of social anxiety and alcohol would usually make me smoke like a chimney. ... but not last night.

I had a few margaritas and talked to a few strangers and didn't smoke. ... and as it turns out, nothing horrible happened at all.

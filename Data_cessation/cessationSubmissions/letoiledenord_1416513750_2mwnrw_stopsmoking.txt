The Great American Smokeout. Trying to quit with America.

Trying to quit. I'm 28 and I've been smoking 10 years. It's scary to see that written out. I've been leading up to it the past few weeks but I'm scared as hell. It's been 38 hours so far and I hope it gets easier because right now it's been pretty hard so far. I started following this sub a month ago to help remind me that I can do it. I'm sick of being embarrassed about my habit and always looking for a place to smoke. I'm already getting wrinkles on my face and my teeth are yellow. The breaking point for me was the coughing. I couldn't sleep anymore. 

I've found everyone on this sub to be the like cheerleaders of reddit which makes me encouraged as I embark of this daunting task. To everyone quitting today, I wish you luck and hope we can do it together.

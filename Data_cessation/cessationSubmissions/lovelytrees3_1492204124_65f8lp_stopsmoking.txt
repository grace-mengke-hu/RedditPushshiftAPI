First day quit. . . Any wise words?

Been smoking for 18 years. . . want to stay quit. This is the 6th time in the last two months that I've attempted. Cravings are okay, but I feel like time is going by slower and I'm beginning to disassociate with reality a little bit. . . I feel so different and panicky and shaky. Is this normal?

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired.

I guess I really don't know what I'm asking for. Encouragement?

Thank you for your time. 


Edit: I'm on day 3 and still going strong. Thanks everybody! Feels good knowing I'm not alone. I've taken all of your advice to heart. :)

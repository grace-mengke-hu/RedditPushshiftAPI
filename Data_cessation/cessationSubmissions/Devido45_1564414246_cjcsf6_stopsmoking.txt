How long should I wait to switch down nicotine percentages?

Hey everybody. I'm on my second attempt at quitting. I quit smoking 5.5 months ago with vaping. And then I quit vaping for 2 months. Now I'm quitting again. I went from 50% nicotine strength to 6% about a week ago and I gotta say the cravings arent stronger but the withdrawals are kicking me into the dirt. I'm optimistic but every morning I'm waking up mid panic attack and I'm anxious for the next half of the day and sometimes full day. So my question is how long should I wait to switch down to 3% nicotine? And then zero percent.

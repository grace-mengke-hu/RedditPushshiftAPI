ALMOST (!) a MONTH!

I am so happy! I can't wait to say "I haven't smoked in a month". I met a guy today that recently celebrate 1 year; I was so jealous. One of my coworkers, who I haven't seen since I quit, asked me to go on a smoke break. Told her NO and felt great. I could help but notice her cough and cough all day. It motivated me to keep going. 3 weeks down - a lifetime to go! ;)

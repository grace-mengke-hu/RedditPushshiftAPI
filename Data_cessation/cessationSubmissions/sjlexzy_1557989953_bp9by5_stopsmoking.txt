Tough going

Hi all.. so, I’ve smoked for 21 years (a pack a day) and am on day four of being smoke free (with a bit of support from vype) I’ve been doing pretty good up to today where all I can think about is smoking. The last time I gave up, day 5 was my worse so I’m wondering if I’m feeling anxious that the same is going to be true this time around... any tips or pearls of wisdom? I could really do with them!

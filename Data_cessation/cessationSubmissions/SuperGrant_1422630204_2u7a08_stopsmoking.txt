Quit yesterday afternoon. Feels great to be free, but headaches?

Anyone else experience pressure around their temples in the first couple of days? Today is my first full smoke free day in 3 years and I'm just so happy about getting passed this dodgy part of my life. I know the cravings with subside eventually but did anyone else have any other physical symptoms?

First smoking dream in which I felt shame

Hi all, it's been about two months since I quit and I had a dream I sneaked a smoke. After smoking (in the dream) I immediately felt shame and that I would need to reset my badge. Vivid and crazy dream! Fortunately, I did not actually smoke! I felt so relieved when I woke up, so relieved.

Anybody else have this happen to them? I used to smoke in my dreams before but no shame. I think this group helps a lot in fixing my mental attitude towards smoking in general.

Three days in for the eleventeenth time.

I am a twenty-six year old guy who smoked over a pack a day for seven years. 

This last year I have become an on/off smoker. I would successfully quit with either the patch, or cold turkey no sweat for a month or two, then a good mood strikes me and I think, "Why not? I've done this well, I can have one and be fine." NOPE. Worst idea ever. Every time I do this, back to square one. I know what is going to happen every time, but that junkie mentality takes me by the dongatron, and shoves my face into the ashtray. 

I slipped up in February and had one after a month and half cold turkey. This turned into one a day for a few weeks, then evolved to a half pack a day for another few weeks. I kept lying to myself, saying that I won't have any tomorrow and be back to a non-smoker. 

I fessed up to myself and bought a pack of patches to help ease me out of the nicotine dependency while I scratch the habit of stepping outside. I'm on day three, and feeling very grumpy. I decided to come here to lay it all out there for myself and others who feel my pain. We got this, fools. Done with this nonsense!

Shouldn't there be a stop smoking chatroom too?

I've quit smoking just a couple of days ago for the 1000th time I think and I feel that there should be a chatroom where people can talk about their smoking woes and motivate each other from quitting smoking. Posts do help but I feel anonymous friends supporting each other through experience is better. Or maybe there's already a chatroom created and I'm not aware of it?

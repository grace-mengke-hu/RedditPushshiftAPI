1 month in &amp; the health anxiety is worsen

I quit cold turkey about a month ago when father in-law having heart attack &amp; later died in hospital few days later, its scared me. So i quit, cold turkey, just like that.

Long story short over the month I've been going to the clinics &amp; ER for about 15 times total (i think bout 5 times to the ER). all because i was scared of my BP, &amp; heart rate.

Doctor diagnose me with stage 1 hypertension. Easily stressed, constantly having dizzy spell, fatigue, tired, trouble sleeping, bloated stomach trapped wind.

Unlike all of the stories I've heard, people getting fat when quit smoking because all of the eating instead of smoking but me, im too scared to eat, scared of bloated stomach, but when not enough eating make my acid reflux acting up.

But I've been exercise regularly, going on jogging every morning &amp; evening. I'm fairly obese guy, I'm about 5'7, &amp; my weight is 110KGS (242lbs) But what scaring me is my heart rate, my resting Heart Rate is 90-105, easily jump to 115. I've done multiple EKG everything seems fine. But I'm still scared of how high it is. Its a vicious cycle when you worried bout heart rate, its get high, you kept on worrying &amp; it keep getting high.

Thing is, before this it could be higher, its just i never noticed it. Before this i smoke a pack a day, hardly sleep, constantly working late, right now when I'm trying to turn myself around, stop smoking, exercise, eat right sleep right, suddenly i notice every beat every thing that twitching on my body which drive me insane &amp; day by day i try to convince myself that its just anxiety &amp; withdrawal, but the symptom its keep getting creative &amp; constant that i cant help to think that is something more serious going on.

I don't know what it is, what I'm feeling, why its getting worst instead &amp; i want to ask if anyone have at least similar issue one way or another.

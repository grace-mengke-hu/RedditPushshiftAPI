One Week!!!

Hi /ss

Today marks one whole week I've gone without smoking. To say that I didn't have crippling urges at times would be a lie, but otherwise I haven't had a huge difficulty getting through the days. I've been getting over a cold that started last Tuesday and haven't been smoking cigarettes to make the coughing and congestion any worse. 

I still don't feel completely free of my addiction yet, and I am still wary of situations where cigs are being smoked. The smell of smoke still triggers bad urges, but I've tried my best to push through and have made it a whole seven days using my own will power! Heck yeah! It feels good.

My best friend is a heavy smoker and we met through smoking cigs. So it's been really hard to not have that cig break and shoot the shit with him like we always do. He's been really supportive and refuses to bum me a cig even if I beg and plead (I can be pretty slick and downright sneaky sometimes when I'm not being honest with myself about smoking).

So anyway, I'm still nervous that I'll break and try to bum a cig from somebody, or if someone offers me one I'm not sure if I could say no. This hasn't occurred yet since I've been in flu quarantine, but I'm confident that as I get more days smoke-free under my belt, my self-control will increase. As for now I'm hiding out and taking care of lungs which I have so greatly abused. 

I was thinking about getting an e-cig so I can still step outside with my friend and enjoy a few minutes downtime without standing there looking like I'm in pain from the intense urges. So far I've been completely cold turkey, but I feel like I would just start to smoke the e-cig with equal fervour and get harsher nicotine urges.

What are your feelings of e-cigs as a way to still feel included in otherwise destructive smoking downtime?

TLDR cold turkey 1 week, feels bad when I'm not included in the smoker circle, e-cigs?

Smoked Bacon

Who knew there was ever such a thing as smoked bacon? I've had smoked beef and other smoked products before, so I stated what the hell, I'll give this a shot. Unbeknownst, I was in for a shock. You see, about 8 months ago I used to smoke cigarettes. I was pretty much your average pack a day smoker before I quit. Since then I've taken up jogging, and have at least inspired my mother to try to quit ( unsuccessfully though ) I love smelling , even though I have a slight nose infection I've yet to take care of.   And some foods taste amazing, particularly those I've yet to enjoy since quitting. Well Smoked bacon happened to be one of them.  But it wasn't the bacony taste that threw me for a loop it was the flavor of the smoke. I dont ever recall actually tasting the smoke so prominently nor so freaking delicious.

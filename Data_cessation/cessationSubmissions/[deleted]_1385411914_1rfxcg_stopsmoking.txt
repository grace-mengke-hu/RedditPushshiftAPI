I dont know where else to post this

I have no one to talk to. I'm depressed, and nicotine is my anti depressant. I am struggling to type this. It's only been two days. My brain is hardly working, I wouldn't be able to cope without booze and weed. My ex doesn't want me back. I've been like this for months. Is everyday supposed to be a struggle? I'm shaking. I've gone a week without any nicotine but always fall back. Was I happier without nicotine? I don't remember. I am a mess. Im only 17 and fight constantly with my fucking brain to be happy. Getting fucked up doesn't even numb it even more. I'm normal, I'm averagely intelligent, I'm not that bad of looking, and I come from average wealth. I have no reason to be depressed, but I am. I refuse to go on anti-depressants. Does the depression ever go away? If i can go two weeks without cigarettes, will it all go away? I have to make it a fucking week first. Again. Alone. WHAT DO I FUCKING DO?!

Hi, I'm quitting cold turkey today.

I've been a "real" smoker for 8 years now (not counting high school days, which was more about "high" than school for me), 1 pack/day and about a week ago a post on reddit about a guy having saved $800 thanks to quitting reminded me that... I still smoked.

Now that I've prepared my mind and emptied my stocks, here we go again. I ended my last cigarette 1 hour ago.

I've never been past 4 months. It was actually going great, I didn't have urges anymore, felt better, was more active...

Until a friend came to me saying his girlfriend was pregnant and she wanted to keep it, he didn't (he also had financial problems) but didn't want to break up, in short he was seeking counsel. Long story short, this looong conversation ended up with me sharing his pack of smokes. His stress was contagious to say the least, as his situation was rather dire, and this time it was more about him than me, which (stupidly) allowed my brain to think "man, a cigarette is nothing compared to his shit". Nice call, ~~brain~~ me. That was 2 years ago.

I'm in France and here our pack of Philip Morris costs 6,90€ ($7.567 exactly). That's 2 518,5€ per year ($2762). Fuck.

I tried vaping instead but even if some products do taste good, you're not a smoker for the taste. Not that it should matter but man do you look dumb vaping.

Needless to say, it also means no coffee and no beer for 2 to 3 weeks! Live like a monk. I feel like such a masochist right now, even if it's for my own good.

So I'm going to lurk this sub, explore its archives while the crazy withdrawal part ends and read all about how life is so much better without cigarettes.

edit: wrote real instead of read. for real.

Thank you guys! I'm pumped!

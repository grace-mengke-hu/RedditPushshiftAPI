New to this forum

Hello friends, as the title says, I'm new to this forum but not new to quit smoking.
I am smoking pack of 10 cigarettes since last 8 years. On certain days, its 15 or more cigarettes per day. I accidentally came across this forum and yeah I want to quit this shit too. I have tried quitting on my own for few times. Had streak like 3-5 days. So i know how amazing and pure it feels after quitting.
I just have a question, i continuously work in night shift (23PM-8AM) so I'm planning to reduce my intake just at my work. Like 3 cigs. In whole shift and no cigarette at home.also changing my brand( i smoke quite a hard cigarette so I'm planning to smoke Marlboro) and after slowly once my body is habitual of 3 cigarettes, i will quit totally. I know its easy to say than trying but How does this sound? And can someone tellme how is the withdrawal symptoms or timeline after quitting ? Because i read some people experienced flu after quitting. So any suggestions and reply would be helpful. 
Thanks and sorry for my English.

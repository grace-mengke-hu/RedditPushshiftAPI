Just had to reset as made no attempt-only lurked. Cancer now a possibility, PLEASE help/ support/ advise. I'm foolish.

Unfortunately I had to had my second Loop Diathermy on Wednesday this week. 


I was given a lot of literature and basically smoking is likely to be the cause of my cervical cells becoming 'aggressive' (as far as I'm aware, they don't drink Stella, so it must be the smoking). 


Doctor very unimpressed with me not giving up as this is the second time I've had this procedure in the last 7 months. 


I get my results within 6 weeks, and whether or not I need to go for further treatment/ if it is real cancer or not, enough is enough. I can't believe I've done this to myself, I'm such an idiot. I have now increased my risk of miscarriage or premature birth, should I ever decide to have children. I've had two chunks cut from my cervix. It's very painful, and very horrible. And I'm scared, if I'm honest. 


I managed to quit for 6 years when I was 21, and then started again a couple of years ago. Now I can't remember how I stopped (and my partner also smokes, though is open to helping quit, though not sure he's dedicated/ ready yet). 


I have the Alan Carr book (which I've started several times, but never actually got more than halfway into) so I'll give that a crack, but if anyone else has ANY advice or comments I'd be hugely massively grateful.


Side note: Kind request: please don't proffer any sympathy (kind as I know this community is) for the cancer stuff as I don't absolutely deserve it, I've completely and utterly done this to myself and am disgusted with myself for STILL struggling, when people get this through no fault of their own every day. I'm a disgrace. Also- not sure if it is definitely cancer yet.

One week down...

And feeling damn good :) Today so far I've not really thought about smoking. Been doing some light work in the gym every evening to start to get fit again and occupy my thoughts, and have actually managed to LOSE weight in my first smoke free week. Thanks to all who post here, who are a constant source of reassurance and inspiration. Heres to the next week, and the rest of the weeks to come :D

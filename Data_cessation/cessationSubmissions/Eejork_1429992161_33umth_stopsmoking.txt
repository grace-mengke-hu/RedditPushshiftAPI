Didn't realise it has been 45 days

So I pretty much quit cold turkey and asked for help here when I decided to quit. That Easy way book really helped and to be honest, I didn't even realise 45 days have been passed. Smoking used to be such a regular thing for me and now not smoking is so natural. I have had the thought that maybe I should grab 1 and just one doesn't hurt, but it feels nice after 4-5 years of smoking to not smoke.

Cheers everyone and good luck ! ^\^^

Just hit the 1 week mark!

I’ve been smoking for 12 years, yet managed to quit twice for a couple of years. I relapsed eventually. I’ve been smoking on and off for some 3 years now (and heavily). Would quit for a day, a week, a month, then relapse over and over again and binge and chain smoke 1 pack in 5 hours every day during my smoking sprees. 

The first time I decided to stop smoking was about  7 years ago because it made me feel sick, especially in the morning. It still does, I feel physically ill each time I smoke. After my binging sessions, I get feverish and shaky. And I keep having these cramps in my chest each time I take up smoking again. I really have to stop, I’m frightened by how it strips me of any will,  logic or care for my own well-being. 

Keep hanging there! In my smoke-free years I remember not even caring about cigarretes and being happy to have quit. I can’t wait to get to that point again! 

REMEMBER! If you’re going through hard times, DO NOT RESORT TO SMOKING! The truth is that it will only make you smellier and sicker.

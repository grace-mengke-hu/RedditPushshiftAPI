Day 2 (Badge Request) and short story

Hello, Group! First time posting in this sub. I've been lurking for a while but couldn't commit to quitting. I wanted to wait until the 2nd day to ask for a badge. I've smoked a pack a day since 20. I'm almost 27 now. This is my 2nd attempt. I quit for 23 days once before using Allen Carr, but my high stress office job and my chain smoking co-workers got to me. I am having a problem getting the support I need from my fianc√©, however. She hates my smoking, and likes to congratulate and reinforce me. This triggers my desire for a cigarette because I no longer feel like I am quitting for myself, I feel like I am doing it for her and being put in a position where I will let her down makes me want to smoke so bad and give up before I even start so I don't. Sorry for the run on, just typing that is really getting to me. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I don't know to communicate this need to her, because I don't feel like it's logical. Thanks and I'm glad to be here!

What do you do to ease nicotine withdrawal symptoms?

I haven't had a cigarette in several months, but I switched to vaping with about 1mg of nicotine. I tried going with 0mg for a few days but on the 4th day I started getting really bad withdrawal where I had a killer headache and stiff neck (this would always happen if I went more than 12 hours without a cigarette when I smoked.)

Do you guys have any suggestions on how to ease physical withdrawal symptoms? For me the issue has always been the physical withdrawal where I'm in so much pain and can't focus that  it's difficult to function throughout the day.

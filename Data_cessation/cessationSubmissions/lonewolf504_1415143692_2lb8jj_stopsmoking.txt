HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT

Now, I might be viewed as a hypocrite here because I do not know if you guys bash on E-cigarettes, but on with my story. I quit smoking actual cigs 30 days ago, and this weekend I went to a music festival (aka a place where joe smoking is extremely likely even if you aren't a smoker due to being drunk or high off something...)WELL I DIDN'T SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND I AM SO FUCKING PROUD OF MYSELF!!!!! I did puff the e cig a few times, but seriously I don't give a fuck at least I didn't have a cigarette!!! WOOOOOOOOOO

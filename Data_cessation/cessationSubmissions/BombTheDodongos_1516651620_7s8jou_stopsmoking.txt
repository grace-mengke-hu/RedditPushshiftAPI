Resetting after 990 Days

My real number is probably closer to 800 days or so. Got smoking again during an emotionally trying time last summer, ended up almost at a pack a day again. Now I'm a fat loser Dad who chose cigarettes over being able to run and play with my two-year-old son. No more. 

I had a fat, drunk, loser Dad and I resent him so much for being who he was. My son deserves and will get better than what I had. I'm 11 weeks sober today and now I'm 24 hours smoke-free. It's all for him.

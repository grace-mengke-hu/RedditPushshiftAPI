Stayed up last night to catch the exact moment I hit 1 year smoke free!!

I have read Allen Carr's book easily half a dozen times. My copy has more notes in the margins than any book I have ever read. I have stopped and started smoking more times in the last 6-7 years than I can remember and I NEVER believed I'd get to this milestone. Crying happy tears today. To everyone on their journey, never doubt your decision to stop smoking!!

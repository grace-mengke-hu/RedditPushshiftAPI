Give up the fight and you will win the fight!

Many people are using their willpower to defeat the cravings. But as investigations have shown, willpower is a limited resource, so it is just logical that you can't win the fight against the craving without having any willpower left.

Many people may find this counter-intuitively, but my main advice is: ***If the addiction is stronger than you, give up!***
Keep smoking and don't try to fight it.

But when your smoking, try to concentrate on it, try to be aware of it, but ***don't*** judge yourself about it! 
Just observe yourself, the cigarette, the smoke, when you're pulling it in and exhaling it, what it does to your mood and body, just like a smoke-meditation.

Regarding my own experience, i kept smoking like this for 2-3 more months. And gradually, without any efford in trying to quit, i noticed, how bad smoking ***really*** was for me and my body. Smoking felt ***disgusting***! 
The desire for a cigarette vanished all by itself.

And that's when i was able to quit from one day to another, effordlessly, without a fight or a plan or reading a book or using an app or using patches or a vape. 
It was just the right decision for ***me***.

So, this might not work for all, but try this out: give those cigarettes the place that they are claiming and observe them. And without even fighting they will retreat by themselves.

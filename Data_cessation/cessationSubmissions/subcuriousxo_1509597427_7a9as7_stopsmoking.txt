Quit Zits?

5 Days and I’m breaking out like... everywhere lol. I haven’t seen zits like this since 2002! I’ve quit smoking before with zero issues so I’m freaking out a bit!! 


Those of you who are farther along, did you have skin issues??  And if you did,  PLEASE for the love of ... tell me it will pass eventually.  :)

Minor craving after 4 days led me back to the start...

I don't know if my subreddit badge counter is updated or not (I'm on mobile right now), but it's not accurate. For some background, I quit for over a year, pretty much 2 years total with nary a craving to be had. Before that, I had smoked for about three years. 

Well, I started again and after a month or so, I was already tired of it. So I did my whole Allen Carr process (for what feels like the fifth time) and managed to get through 4 days rather easily. Blocked some heavy cravings, too, so that was nice. 

But today, I had the minor, minor craving to get another pack. It was so minor that I wasn't even itching for one, it was most definitely a mental crave. But I relapsed and bought a pack a couple of hours ago... currently smoking my second. 

Any advice? I'm going to reset my app counter, because this is pathetic. I think the hardest part of all this is the mental aspect. I'm so used to taking a break, enjoying my time outside, that I just associate cigarettes with it. So, any help or suggestions for where to go from here would be appreciated.

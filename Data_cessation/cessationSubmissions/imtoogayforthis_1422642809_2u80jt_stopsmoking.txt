Stopped smoking for 48 hours

I haven't smoked in 48 hours.  the last time I smoked I only had a half a cig. I started using cytisine (aka Tabex)  which I ordered from Europe.  It has done a fantastic job at managing withdrawal symptoms.  Previously every time I tried to quit, I would get a pain in my chest, and strong cravings after about 12 hours.  

I spent about a month cutting back from half a pack a day to 2 a day before I quit. 

I highly recommend Cytisine for anybody that is experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  it cost only about $15 for 100 tablets, and doesn't contain nicotine.

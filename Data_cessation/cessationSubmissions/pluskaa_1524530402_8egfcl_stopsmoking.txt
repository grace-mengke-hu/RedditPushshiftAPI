Now

Roommate and I just shared our last cigarette together today after years of being very enabling to each other. 

I've tried to quit so many times in the past that while I feel hopeful, I can't even start to get high hopes yet. 

Won't smoke with you for the rest of the day, and not tomorrow, either.

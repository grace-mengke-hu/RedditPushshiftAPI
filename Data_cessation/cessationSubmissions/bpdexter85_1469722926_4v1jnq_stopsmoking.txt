Question about patches and nicotine delivery

I've been using the patch for a few days now and my experience has been somewhat mixed compared to the last time I used them.

I'm using generic Walgreens patches, which seem to give a lot of nicotine when I put them on in the morning (I'm pretty shaky honestly), but then throughout the day it's changed and by the end of the day I feel like I don't even have one on.

The last time I used the patch, it was a name brand and seemed to last longer and deliver a more consistent dose. Does anyone know if this is true or if this is all in my mind and I'm just experiencing frustration from not having a cigarette all day?

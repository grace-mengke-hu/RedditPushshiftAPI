I thought about buying a pack all day

it’s been a terribly stressful couple of weeks, and today was especially hard. every hour or so I kept thinking: i’ll just buy one pack. then I took my dog for a walk and realized the trees near my house with the beautiful red and white blossoms SMELLED. and they smelled LOVELY. i’ve lived here five years and I never knew how nice they were. weird.

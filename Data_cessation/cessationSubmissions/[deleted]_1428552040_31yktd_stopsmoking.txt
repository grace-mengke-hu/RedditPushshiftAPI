Worried about my boyfriend, how can I help him stay on track?

My boyfriend and I recently quit smoking.  We have had a few slips here and there, but have mostly stayed smoke free.  However I am worried about him.  Right now I don't see him more than a few times a week because he is away at school.  I usually spend the weekends with him, but I can't see him that often during the week (his school is about an hour away from me).   

His best friend gave up smoking a few months ago because her new boyfriend didn't approve of smoking.   Now they are having issues, and she started sneaking cigarettes again.  She bought a pack and smoked a few with my boyfriend last thursday.  she wanted to keep it a secret, but he did tell me.  I'm not upset with him, but I am upset with her dragging him into her problems, and playing with his addiction when he is vulnerable and trying to quit.  I would rather him tell me about it, so I didn't make it an issue, and just tried to focus him back on staying quit.

My worry though is that she is going to ruin his quit and cause him to relapse, especially since he has been stressed out by how much schoolwork he has to do in the last couple weeks of the semester.   When I was down visiting him on tuesday he kept on saying he was getting really intense cravings, but we worked through them.

I don't want him fail at this because he has been doing a great job of it so far going days in between slips.  I want to encourage him to stay quit, and not slip up again, but I don't want to be the nag.  And I can't be there 24/7 to be fully supporting.

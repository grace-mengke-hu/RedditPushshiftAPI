Day 1. Using a nicotine replacement device. Sat down to puff on it, grabbed a lighter and tried to light it.

Was around non smokers Saturday. My vape broke, it never quite did the trick anyways. So I bought a disposable nicotine pen, and it worked really well. I usually will still sneak a smoke or two but I made it the whole night with just the pen. Sunday night I ran out of smokes and decided that maybe I quit. So I’ve spent today not having a single smoke. 

Which brings me back to this afternoon. Totally went to my quit app, logged my craving, put the pen in my mouth and tried to light it. Muscle memory is a thing. I was cracking up. 

I know I’m still addicted to nicotine, but today I think I may have quit cigarettes. I’m pretty stoked on that.

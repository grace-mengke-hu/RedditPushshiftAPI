I officially tossed my cigarettes and lighter out of the house. I'm over, finished, gone, done and out. I quit! Questions inside.

25 days ago I made a [post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1cninr/been_a_smoker_for_21_years_i_want_to_quit_i/) about how badly I want to quit. 25 days later I finally made the choice to begin my cigarette free life. Something snapped tonight and I threw 2 and a half packs of cigarettes to the garbage, never to be seen again. 

I understand the intensity of the challenges ahead of me, but my resolve is dead on. I will not be telling anyone, with the exception of sharing my experience here. Doing this for myself and keeping my own resolve in check is far more meaningful then impressing others and becoming accountable to friends/family I have told. 

Any tips to a 39 year old ex-smoker of 20+ years? Anything I can do now to help with what will surely be a war in my mind in the upcoming days?

I'm free, damnit it. I'm finally free.

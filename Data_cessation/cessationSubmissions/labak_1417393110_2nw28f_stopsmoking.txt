What should I expect?

I am 18 years old. I have been smoking for little over a year. It all started just in pubs, usually just once a week. For the majority of the year I smoked like this. And I never had any problems  not smoking for extended periods of time. 

Few months ago I started smoking daily. I mostly rolled my own cigarettes and I would go through 40g tobacco in two or three days. 

I caught a cold last week and since than I limited my smoking to around five a day. And I am quite ok with that. I smoke only when I really feel the need to. 

It quite surprised me to find out I was able to cut it this much. That made me think I could probably stop entirely. And about this, I have a few questions. 

Firstly, is it better, in my situation, to quit cold turkey or to slowly lower the daily dose even more? What would the difference be? What are your experiences with each method? 

Second, what should I expect to feel? I already experienced nervousness, inability to focus, restlessness, being snappy to people and similar unpleasant feelings. How will I feel as I quit? How will the feelings evolve? When will they stop? 

And lastly, do you have any tips for me? Is there something I haven't even thought of that I should know? 

Thanks for any help :-)

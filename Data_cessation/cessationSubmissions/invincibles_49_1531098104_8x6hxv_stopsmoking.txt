A money related stop smoking tip.

I have gone without a cigarette for 29 days now. I have saved up around 9k INR but instead of saving the money I have made sure that I always splurged a little more than I spent. So I have already spent 12k even though my non smoking saving are 9k.

This serves two purposes:
1. I will be an idiot if I started smoking now as the money is already spent. 

2. When it smoking now vs saving for the future, the now will always win. So this way it's spending now vs smoking later and the spending wins.

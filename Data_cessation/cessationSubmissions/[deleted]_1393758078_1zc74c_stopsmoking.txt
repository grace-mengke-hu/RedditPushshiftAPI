Day 5 and really depressed

After a solid 8 years of smoking I gave up cold turkey for a solid year the allen carr way, about 6mo after taking it up again tried champix/chantix and I would not recommend it in a million years, caused all kinds of detrimental problems and didn't last long. Again recently trying the allen carr method and dealing with cravings etc hasn't been the slightest problem. been out drinking with friends and no problems etc so going great.

But late day 4/ through day 5 I've been pretty seriously depressed out of the blue. I've had a history of depression but have kept on top of it with a healthy lifestyle over the last couple of years, but I know what it's like when it's bad and this came on fast. Anyone else had similar experiences? I don't remember this the first time around.

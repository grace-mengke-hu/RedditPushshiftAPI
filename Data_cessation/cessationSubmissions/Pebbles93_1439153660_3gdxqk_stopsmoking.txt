Super proud!!!!!!

Just realised it's day 90! That's nearly TRIPLE DIGITS!!!!!!!!!

I have saved Â£635.51! And I have not smoked 1818 smokes (according to my little app I just downloaded) 

To anyone who's just starting or who is struggling - you got this! Just remember how awesome you feel for not lifting the ciggerette, and feel proud of how far along you are right now!

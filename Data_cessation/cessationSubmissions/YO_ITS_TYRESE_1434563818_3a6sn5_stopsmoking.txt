Replaced Smoking with Dip/Ecigs

Hey - I wanted to come on here and see if anyone is in a similar boat as me, how they ended up, and what tricks they used.

I work up in the oil patch and smoking is sort of the way of life up here. I had my birthday while I was up at work, driving from town to site, and decided I didn't like the road I was going down. So I started throwing my smokes and lighters out of the car as I drove.

I haven't smoked at all since then, but I have been regularly using dip and ecigs with nicotine juice. In all I feel a lot better, but it doesn't feel "done" yet. Part of the problem is that I have my other vices (mostly drinking) that I can't fulfill as it's a dry camp. It's a high stress job (I know it's not uncommon for a lot of you) and after getting in fights with others I usually want to walk away and have a smoke. Now I dip instead.

Just wondering how you guys deal with that urge. In my head it's "I'm pissed of because of X, so now I will smoke/dip/drink. Now that I have smoke/dipped/drank, I have dealt with being pissed of because of X and I can move forward". That is the hump I am stuck on currently.

Thanks

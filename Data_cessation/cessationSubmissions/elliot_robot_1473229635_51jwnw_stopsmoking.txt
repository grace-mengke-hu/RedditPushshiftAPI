I found this subreddit today. And i want to share my story

**That day**

 * Started smoking at the end of college (When i was 22). 

* Smoked a lot for two years in a row. Got some breathing problems twice or thrice in a year. I will stop smoking for 3 or 4 days at that time and then start again. Then i fell in love, took her advice and quit smoking.

**Going back**

* But it didn't last. Some days i see myself smoke in my dreams and i get very sad when i woke up (missing that cigarette)

* Then i got a job and i try to find excuses to smoke. One day me and my girlfriend fought each other and i started smoking that day. I smoked a chain of cigarettes. I lied to my girlfriend that i am not touching cigarettes. 


**Second try**

* Last year on july 24th(a sunday) i was smoking a cigarette. I smoked two in a row and i just felt fed up. I started googling on how to quit and i see all those articles i read before. Then i searched in playstore and download a quitting app  just to test.

* That worked for me. It showed all those rewards for me like trophies, achievements. Its like you are playing a game in difficult mode and all you have to do in that game is don't smoke. I am not here promoting those apps. It didn't work for some of my friends. But if you are in this subreddit and you are trying to quit smoking then i believe that it will work. We need encouragement and those types of apps are helpful. In short i quit smoking that sunday.

* Then i started watching all those anti-smoking videos and it was terrifying. Since i quit it also felt like im doing the right thing. Every time i get an urge to smoke i open the app and look at the stats. It shows like money saved, lung capacity etc.
After looking at all those health related issues caused by smoking i no longer needed the app. I uninstalled it. 

* Lot of situations came where i got so tensed i thought about smoking. But i understood i will get more tensed after that since i watched all those health related videos. So i just eat chocolate or drink something. 

**Now (After 1 year)**

* I was dumped by my girlfriend three days ago(The same one who told me to stop smoking). I was so broken. I wanted to smoke again to hurt myself but i didn't. I don't want to destroy all this progress i made go in vain for someone else. So yeah. 1 year is enough to say goodbye to cigarette forever.

**TL;DR**
I quit smoking for me and i succeeded for 1 year. Do it for yourself. Make that decision. If you are   doing it because somebody else is telling you then you will find excuses to smoke again.

Jan 2018 Quitters: Support Chat Group

Hi Guys, 

It's my 6th day of quitting but still have many strong cravings. Every time it feels like I can't beat this one and will have to smoke now. But somehow I'm managing not to smoke since last 5days and plan to keep it that way. 

So, though of creating a group of people who have just recently (maximum 1 or 2 weeks) quit and can be each others support in these difficult times. 

So, please encourage each other, support each others in cravings and make healthy life possible for each other. 

Post Format:
Post your craving or feeling
Others please share your experiences and suggestions in replies. 

Let's go smoke free guys.

Why did you quit?

Putting health, money, the smell everything aside. I decided because my inlaws kept calling me names such as ashtray etc. Quite nasty people to me considering used to smoke to. And so I decided to show them up.

5 days into quitting. Cold turkey. (Last smoke was 3pm Christmas day). I still would get up and hear "HEYYYY ASHTRAYS AWAKE" and "Heyy i can smell the ashtray coming" And Id just end up in my room crying. But hey this bullying is at this stage what keeping me from smoking.

Day 10 came along and Id had it. This bullying. Being frowned upon. I snapped...told them and they were shocked. Them accusing me of the smell is their imagination...clothes are clean. 0 cigarettes. Etc. So shut up.

Anyway... wasnt the best day those nasty people and now Im living with my dad whom smokes. Day 14 and still no craving or want for one. I started at 18yrs im now nearly 22

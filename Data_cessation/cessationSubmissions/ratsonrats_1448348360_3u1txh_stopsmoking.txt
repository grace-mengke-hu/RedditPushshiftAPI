My girlfriend is a social smoker but I think it's getting worse and she doesn't think it is.

My girlfriend smokes when she drinks. She says it keeps her from drinking too much. I told her I don't like it when she smokes, just because I have very strong feelings about it (Uncle died of lung cancer) and she always counters with she's only owned one pack of cigarettes her entire life and it's not a big deal. That worked for me for awhile but it seems there are more and more instances of her smoking at parties and she's not smoking her cigarettes but bumming them from other people which leads me to believe the "one pack her entire life" is just a cover up so I don't worry about her. Recently she made a comment about how she was really craving a cigarette and we walked by some people smoking and she could barely stand it. Basically I'm just concerned she's falling into addiction and she's not taking my concerns seriously and I'm not sure what to do/how to get through to her. Also should I really be concerned about her health if she is JUST a social smoker? I think the idea of a "social smoker" is outrageous but I just wonder if anyone else has experience with this as well. 

TL:DR girlfriend is a social smoker however I'm worried she's getting addicted, need help on how to get through to her

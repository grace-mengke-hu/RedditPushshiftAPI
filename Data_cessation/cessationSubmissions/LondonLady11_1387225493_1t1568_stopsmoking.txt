Hi I'm brand new here...

I am 30 and have been smoking constantly since I was 11.
By 12 I was smoking 10 a day.
I've got 2 kids and smoked right through pregnancies.
My sister even wheeled me out the hospital was I was having contractions so I could have a quick fag knowing it would be ages til my next one!

Well October came around and I downloaded the app, stobtober... When I saw the amount of money I was wasting I thought I'd give quitting a go.

It didn't work too well, so I went and made an app to see the nurse about quitting, I missed the first appointment so didn't end up seeing her till the end of November.

She told me she herself had been a 30 a day smoker until 3 years ago, this made me listen to her whole heartedly and she totally inspired me to give it my all.

She gave me 25mg patches and the quick spray nicorette mouth spray.
I call that the emergency use spray!!!

Well today is my day 15... It's not been easy, but on day one - while trying hard to sleep of the craving I decided to go for a walk instead and randomly joined a gym!

Everyday I've been there daily for at least a swim, and a few classes during the week.

I figured it will keep me busy and help me be tired at the end of the day. Rather than laying there thinking about cigarettes!
Also help keep me in shape as it's true that u pick more when u quit!!

The gym membership cost about 3 days of smoking a week!!

I'm actually saving my £3.66 or £4 a day in an un'openable tin, and hopefully by next summer will have saved enough to treat my kids to a nice sun holiday...

They are my inspiration :) 

Thanks for reading....

Laura

Day 6 and some useful tips for those struggling!

Well I survived my first day back at work! - which I may add I did not think I could do... Even with the most stressful day ever (I'm Director of Business Development in London) so very stressful without catching up on 3 weeks work! 

I tell myself whenever I am struggling that "I CAN DO THIS"!!! Which helps me!

I have found vaping only when I am struggling or to maintain routine useful! I too was unsure about what's inside them but had my dads laboratory run some tests on its vapour, which were fine! I am using the Vype eStick from Sainsburys with mint or cherry tips (the tobacco as you may expect is vile).

I also use the app "Digipill" and downloaded the quit smoking pill. It's an hypnotic type of app that just helps remind you why you quit and is useful to listen to at night or to take 10mins out in the day! Very useful...

Well here we go for day 7... It won't be long until we are all much healthier, smell fresh and can TASTE our food! 

Stay strong and remember WE CAN DO THIS!!!

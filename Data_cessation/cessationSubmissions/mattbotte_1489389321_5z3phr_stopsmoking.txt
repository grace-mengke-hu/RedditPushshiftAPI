7 weeks not smoking and still addicted.

I am not too sure why I am posting this however here we are. I haven't had a cigarette since 21st of Jan and still going strong. However I still feel addicted, you see I still vape. Now my liquid says zero nicotine but it genuinely tastes as strong as about 6mg nicotine liquid. I still do not go a day without vaping and always want my vape on my person. Still addicted. I am happy that I am not smoking and rarely feel cravings for a cigarette, however I know if I've been drinking my resolve is greatly weakened. So 7 weeks free and I still feel trapped as if I were smoking. I am happy with my progress and position but I am not there yet. I am aware that I am letting myself reside at the edge of the woods and not leaving completely. If this text has any meaning, be careful with nicotine replacements and conscious that addiction doesn't end at the last puff. Keep staying strong my non-smokers, I'll be with you one day. Thank you for reading this aimless and venting post. Take care.

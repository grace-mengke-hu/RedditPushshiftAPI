Nightmares about my mom

I'm 32. My mom died at 52 due to smoking related illnesses. I have nightmares about her death all the time. I have more than 20 years worth of things left to do. I feel like nervous shit all the time because of smoking and poor diet. Today I pitched the smokes, put on sneakers, and walked until I couldn't anymore. I got some nicotine gum. I've smoked half my life. I hope I can feel good again. Thx for this sub.

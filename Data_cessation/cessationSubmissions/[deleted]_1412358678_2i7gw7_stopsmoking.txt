Please help me get my girlfriend, 20, to quit.

She has been so good since we've been together. Before I came along, she would smoke a lot (in my eyes anyway). I couldn't give you numbers but since she has been with me she can go weeks without one but then slip and have one.

I know this seems silly, it's not much but it is my pet hate and she knows that. I don't want to seem controlling either and tell her she "has to quit or else".

Recently we moved to university. I thought (naively) that she had stopped but when she goes out and gets drunk, she apparently has had a smoke here and there.

I threw a got angry with her the other night when I found out she bought a packet of cigarettes, I don't want to but it really bugs me. She blindly thinks she is invincible to the effects. She tells me she wants to go on runs with me and thinks that smoking won't effect that either.

Also she hangs around with some smokers so that just makes my life harder because she craves it when she is around them. I need to convince her to stay strong when she's with them too now since uni started.

It's just that final hurdle of actually quitting, I want her to do. Is that the hardest part? How can I convince her to make the change? How can I help her without being controlling?

She's my dream girl except for that and I don't really know who else to ask so thank you to all of you!

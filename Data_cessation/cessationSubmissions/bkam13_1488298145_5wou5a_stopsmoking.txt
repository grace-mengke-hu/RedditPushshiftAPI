Lent

Hey guys,

I have posted here many a time saying that this is going to be my last time smoking. I have decided (along with some of my friends) to give up smoking for Lent. I'm not too religious a person, but I do see the appeal for giving something up for Lent.

Anyone else here have the same resolution?

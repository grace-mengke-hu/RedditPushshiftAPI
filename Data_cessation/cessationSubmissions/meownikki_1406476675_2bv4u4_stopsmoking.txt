Does anyone know where to get free quit packages?

Every time I mention quitting, someone tells me there are places that offer free quit packages. Is this true? Do you know who to contact/where to go? I'm noticing the withdrawals are killing me and I always end up smoking after stopping for a day or two on my own. Please help!

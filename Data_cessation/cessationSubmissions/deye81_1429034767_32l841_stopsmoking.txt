Mornings are a struggle

Hello,

I'm working hard on quitting, but not completely smoke free just yet. I'm able to go through the day without a Cigarette, but on mornings I just can't get past the craving. I end up stopping to buy cigarettes on my way to work, but after I smoke a couple, I feel disgusted and end up throwing the packet away. Is anyone in a similar situation and if you conquered the morning cravings, please share your techniques/thought process.

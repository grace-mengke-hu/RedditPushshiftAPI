Don't forget about another possible bonus to stopping.

I mentioned to my insurance agent that I had stopped smoking for nearly a year and she said I'm eligible for a non smoker rate on my life insurance. This is in addition to decreased rates on my health insurance too. Just another reminder of other ways smoking can hit you in the wallet besides the (ridiculously high) purchase price.

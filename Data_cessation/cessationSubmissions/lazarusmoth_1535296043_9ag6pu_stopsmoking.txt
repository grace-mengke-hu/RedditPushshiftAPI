Day 3. Shenanigans without smoking.

Yep, feeling pretty good. Thought I couldn't handle going to my usual night haunts without smoking, but my friends are pretty supportive with my quit goals. Drank, played pool, played poker, and generally had a good time without smoking. Ending Day 3 on a really good note!

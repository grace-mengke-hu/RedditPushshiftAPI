2 Weeks Down...so far!

14 days without smoking. My husband is struggling a bit. We both smoked a pack a day so it's been hard.  My coping mechanism for anything stressful, difficult, boring, just about anything, is all of a sudden gone. 

I'm finding myself resenting my husband. If he can have one a night then why can't I?  I hope we can get to the other side of this!

We went to a concert over the weekend. It felt so good not to have to take a break and go stand in the rain during the middle of it.

One step at a time but I'm feeling motivated by the stories from other redditors in here!

Figured I'd put it down somewhere.

I still struggle with have a bnm 'gar every/other night. Running into friends I used to share a square with. Going out for drinks and heading out to the firepit. It's hard to stop entirely, a little bit of me just doesn't want to let go.

It took a few months before I lit up a cigarette after my last attempt. I don't look at the months I spent without smoking as quitting, because if that's what quitting is then I'll never really quit smoking. But I've more hope than that and I know it can be done, I'm just not pushing myself hard enough. 

Yesterday will be my last though, tossed out the half-full pack in the middle of smoking one, put it out and walked away. I can't put a number on how many times I've tried to quit, but at least I've got a point of origin posted on here now.

18 months...mostly not tempted

I'm at 18 months cigarette free today. I bought myself an early present back in June, a 2014 Triumph Bonneville. Then I crashed it three weeks later and I've got a broken shoulder on one side and a super broken forearm on the other. I'm off work until I get better and with all this time on  my hands it has had me thinking about those meditative smoking sessions I used to have. Thankfully I've not been truly tempted and all of my smoker friends know better than to offer me one. Stay strong, everyone.

Yet another go at quitting

I'd say that this is probably my third serious attempt at quitting smoking but this time it feels like it could work. I managed to stop for about 6 weeks but then foolishly relapsed and didn't stop again until this week. 

Right up until Tuesday morning I was getting really sick of smoking. The ritual, smell, taste, cost and everything about this dirty habit I hate.

It's been 3 days now and I feel like utter dog shit, less shit than on Tuesday but still pretty shit none the less. Has anyone else experienced this feeling this shit this early then? I'm trying to not even think about socialising yet though, because this is how I fell off last time. Also, I am now the only one in my group of friends who doesn't smoke so whelp. How did any of you manage to swerve this one? 

I'll keep on going on day at a time and seriously crush this addiction that has haunted me since I was 16.

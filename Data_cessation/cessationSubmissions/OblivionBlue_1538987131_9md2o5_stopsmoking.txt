How to deal with social anxiety / depression after quitting?

After smoking on and off for 6 years, I quit three months ago. I’m now realising I smoked to self-medicate my (admittedly mild) mental health issues. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I could always rationalise going out to a party because I knew I’d be able to escape and have a cigarette, and I looked forward to every cigarette each day which kept me moving forward.


Now, because I’m not very confident, I find myself very anxious before and during social events, with no way to wind down besides drinking a lot, which is not the healthiest option. 


I’ve even pulled out of an all-expenses-paid work trip because our team had to do a dance performance (which is basically my worst nightmare haha).


Anyway, how did you cope with the things that you were smothering with smoking?

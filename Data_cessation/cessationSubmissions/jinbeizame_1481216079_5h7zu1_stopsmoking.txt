I guess building and train anti-smoking laws are doing something...

As I mentioned a few days ago, I've been thinking of picking back up where I left off a whole lot recently. Ridiculously, one of the things stopping me is not shame, but rather not actually being able to use the cigarettes when I'd like to. I'm on a high building of an office (only time I can leave it is lunch), and take a train to and from it (cutting real close on the commute home), and I literally would only be able to smoke once I get home at night. Plus, campus around the building is apparently smoke-free, as are train platforms etc.


Well, fuck me.

relapse after relapse

after i continually find myself relapsing i’m finding less and less motivation to quit. sometimes i’m just like screw it i’ll just smoke one. and it sucks. i feel so down on myself and all my other addictions are overwhelming me. i feel like they’re all connected to smoking and if i can just beat this habit all my other addictions will cease.

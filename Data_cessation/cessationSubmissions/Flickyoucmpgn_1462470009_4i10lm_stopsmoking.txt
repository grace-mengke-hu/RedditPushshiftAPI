Hey Reddit, help us say FLICK YOU to cigarette litter and the flicking habit that causes it!

When smokers flick their cigarettes, they flick off the world. To help them realize the damage they're causing, we're saying FLICK YOU to the litter and the flicking habit that causes it.
We're declaring tomorrow 5/6 Anti-cigarette Litter Day and we could use your help!
Visit our social pages to help make a FLICK YOU heard around the world.

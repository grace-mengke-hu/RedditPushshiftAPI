I'm Just Tired of Failing.

I'm tired of failing. Must've quit two dozen times since June, and even made it 65 days on one go, and 30 some on another. Then I have one for some odd reason, perhaps thinking it'll be easy again tomorrow, and BAM! Two packs a day without fail.

It is just fucking ridiculous. Worst part is how mad and down on myself I get for it. I know perhaps I should go easy but I just don't want to be a smoker. There is absolutely no reason to smoke. I'm not the least bit under the impression that I enjoy it, I don't! I hate it! I smoke every day till I have a headache, feel nauseas, and I stink! 

Unbelievable how hard this thing is to put in the rear view mirror.

Quitting again tomorrow. Here's my plan:

1. Use my 'cheat sheet.' A little paper I printed out with the reasons I'm quitting and why it's the right choice for me.
2. Stay plugged in on this forum. When or if I have an intense craving post it to reddit and let you guys talk me out of smoking.
3. I gave my friend $250 that he'll keep if I smoke. (This worked for my longer attempt, then I got the money back, but has had mixed results and actually cost me some cash on other attempts... I know, it's a little crazy).
4. Breathe deeply and remind myself that this is one of the best decisions I will ever make for myself.

Thanks reddit. You guys are great, already feeling better writing this and being on here.

As a side note, how many attempts did it take you?

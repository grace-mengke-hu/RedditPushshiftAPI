First meal with no cigarette after

Help.

I've been vaping since Christmas. I successfully replaced cigarettes with vaping once before, when I was too broke to get cigarettes. That lasted 1.5 year. Then my brother died and I started smoking again. Eight months later, my dad died and 1 pack became 2, then 2.5 and even 3 at times. Basically, most of my friends smoke, so I could smoke 1 pack in two hours when I was out with them.

My mom got me an 30w istick for Christmas and I slowly went down to 3-6 cigarettes a day, where I've been since. I sometimes have to avoid my friends, either by not going out as often or by walking out in the fresh air and away from them when I'm with them. That part kind of sucks and it's one reason why I haven't completely quit until today (hopefully). I smoke 1 cigarette after every meal, 1 with each cup of coffee and 1-2 when I go out.

Other reasons why I haven't completely quit is that my favorite coffee (Greek iced coffee, strong enough that it works better than Drano) tastes like garbage when I vape and the real reason behind it the excuses, pure fear and extreme anxiety at the thought of quitting. The cigarettes with my meals and coffee are pretty much obsessive-compulsive behavior (seriously, I just ate and I'm out of cigarettes. Help!).

I just downloaded a poster that says: "you're stronger than they are" and set it as my wallpaper. I've experienced some pretty awful things, I've lost and 50 kg and this is my 3d year in maintenance and I can definitely stop smoking. I hope I also want to...

Also, I just sent the badgebot a pm and got the year wrong, like an idiot. Is there a way to fix it?

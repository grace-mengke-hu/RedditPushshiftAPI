Quitting process has begun, but I feel I failed

I wrote a post a couple of days ago, which was basically just me rambling about it.

In the time since that post, I have had many thoughts about this. Figured out some of the things that make me want to quit. Like I would like nicer teeth, save some money and generally get healthier.

I really want it now, but I just had a cigarette :( So I kind of feel I already failed. My thoughts are, that the biggest hurdle for me is the habbit. I need to switch it out with something. My plan is to use gum instead. Not nicotine gum, just regular gum.

Next time I want to smoke, I will try taking a gum instead, and see how it goes.

My roommate gave me his e-cig and all its accoutrements for free on Saturday because he "can't stand the smell" (though I think he was actually concerned for my health). I haven't smoked cigs since Saturday.

I was at a pack a day and the longest I'd gone without smoking was two days but it was a real struggle. Now I haven't smoked since last Saturday with only minor, occasional cravings.

Thanks to my roommate's generosity I feel like there is actually hope for me now. I won't smoke the e-cig forever, but I'd rather smoke that than cigs while weaning off nicotine.

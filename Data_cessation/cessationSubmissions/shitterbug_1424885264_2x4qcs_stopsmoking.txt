On and off all the time, I've had it. I want to do it for real.

Started smoking about 5 years ago, a little less, probably. Stopped 1 1/2 years ago for 4 months, then caved: Too much stress at university. I've been on and off ever since, sometimes not smoking for 2 weeks, and then smoking 1 pack a day for a week.

I want to really stop now. Had my last cigarette on Saturday, today, Tuesday, is day 3.

Maybe this sub will keep me encouraged!

Cheers

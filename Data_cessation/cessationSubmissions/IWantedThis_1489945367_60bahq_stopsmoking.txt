Just had my last cigarette!

Hello everyone,
This community is the best support I feel I have. Your posts have helped me with a lot of cravings in the past.

My last quit smoking attempt was a 2 months back and I lasted 8 days with NRT. This time I'm not going to use anything and I'm positive that I'm going to stay smoke free forever.

I am pack a day smoker from the last 7 years and have been suffering from severe health anxiety. I got full body health checkups done and nothing came out. The doctor said it's high time that I should quit smoking. If I don't quit smoking now the damage to my body would be irreversible and if I succeed in no time risk of any disease would be the same as a non-smoker.

Next I visited my family doctor who also happens to be a specialist doctor of helping people with various addictions. He suggested that he had known and the fact that I visited him and confessed (smoking is a big social stigma in my part of the world) about my smoking problem is that this time I'm serious about it. He suggested he can hook me up with a patch/NRT but told me that it's all about will power at the end of the day. I was asked to pay a visit incase I'm not able to quit with my will power and he will definitely help me. I sincerely hope I'm not going to need a professional to help me with this addiction and will manage this on my own.

Kudos to everyone who has managed to quit. My best wishes to people who are planning to quit or are in their initial days of quitting. Stay strong!

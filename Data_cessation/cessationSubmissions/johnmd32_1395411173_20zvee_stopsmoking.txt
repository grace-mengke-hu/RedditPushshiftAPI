A warning against that one puff

I'm not sure where the data on this is, but this article says something interesting.

"This, as with most things to do with smoking, has been thoroughly studied: 88 per cent of those who have even one puff after they have stopped will return to full-time smoking. On average, they have their second cigarette nine days later and return to full-time smoking after six weeks."

Don't give into that 1 puff (It's going to taste disgusting anyway!)

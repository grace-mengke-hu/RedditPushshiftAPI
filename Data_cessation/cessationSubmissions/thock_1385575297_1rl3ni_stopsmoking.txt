Persistant headaches after quitting - looking for advice.

I have been cig free for about 17 days now after smoking for about 7 years or so, but after a couple of days I started getting consistent headaches mid-afternoon every day.  They have continued, and I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to slow them down or get rid of them.  

I have been using an e-cig to help with cravings, and that has helped a ton I believe (I'm using a medium level nicotine solution).  I've read that part of nicotine withdrawals are headaches, but they usually go away after a week or so.  Any advice from my fellow quitters?  Thanks in advance!

I wanted to quit smoking today... But now I'm crying because I'm so scared

I feel like I am the weakest person in the world. I never attempted to quit smoking, and was sure I was going to do it today. I'm almost finished with Allen Carr's book, but now I'm so scared I can't stop crying. Am I not ready to quit yet? But then again, if I'm not ready now, when will I ever be?

Has anyone had experience with these green tea cigarettes or anything similar?

I got a vape about a month ago and since then my cigarette intake has dropped quite a bit going from 10 - 15 a day to 4 - 5 a day but I can't honestly think of a reason why I smoke the 5 cigarettes that I do smoke.

It's a habit thing, I smoke the cigarettes at the same time every day. One in the morning, one after classes, one on each break at work and sometimes one before bed.

Has anyone used these green tea cigarettes?? I feel like they would help a lot with the habitual smoking and I assume they can't be worse than cigarettes for my lungs.

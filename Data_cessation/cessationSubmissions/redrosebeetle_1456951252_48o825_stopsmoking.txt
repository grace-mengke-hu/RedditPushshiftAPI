Today is the day!

I have been smoke free for 17 days today.  17 was the age I started smoking at.  17 is the number of years I smoked.  So, one smoke free day for every year!  Here's to hoping that soon smoking will be something I did while I was young and stupid.  It bothers me that I've smoked for half my life and that I smoked for so long.  Of course, there's no sense in being bothered, I can't go back in time or anything, but, still....

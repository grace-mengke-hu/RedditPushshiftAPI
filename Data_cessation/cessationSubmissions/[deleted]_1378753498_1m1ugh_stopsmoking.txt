Just put on my first nicotine patch, need advice.

Could anybody share there experiences with the patch? The only reason I have had a hard time quitting smoking is I get extremely bitchy if I don't smoke. Mood swings screaming crying it's ridiculous really, but I'd just so much easier to have a smoke then deal with that. Does the patch help with those kind of withdrawal symptoms?

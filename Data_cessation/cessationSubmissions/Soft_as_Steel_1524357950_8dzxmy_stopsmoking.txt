1 month tonight-white knuckle

First time poster, long time lerker. So I quit one month ago tonight. I'm celebrating by myself cause I have been a complete asshole since I quit. Went to a Alan Carr seminar and left thinking I got this. Next morning started my nightmare. Smoking for 20 years I guess you gotta pay the price but the depression is incredible. Any suggestions to help with my shitty attitude?

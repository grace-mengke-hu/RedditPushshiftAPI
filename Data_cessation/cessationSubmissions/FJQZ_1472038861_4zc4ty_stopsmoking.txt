Don't get too comfy

I stopped cold turkey.  It was hard at first.  Mainly the first few days, but I knew I could do it. Fast forward 2 weeks and I really felt like I didn't need it at all.  I had even drank and not smoked.  But one night while drinking with friends,  I ask my friend for a puff.  At first he didn't want to but I convinced him.  Puff, and yuck.  "How could I have smoked a pack a day for 10 years" I asked myself.  Well,  it wasn't the only puff.  Had a few more the next 2 weeks while drinking with friends.  Nothing much, maybe like 5 puffs in those 2 weeks combined. I really thought I wouldn't get hooked again.  So it had been a month and I hadn't smoked 1 whole cigarette and I was really proud.  So how did I reward myself you ask? I smoked a cigarette.  "Whatever,  no biggie" I thought.  Then I started smoking 1 or 2 when drinking.  Fast forward to 2 months after initially quitting and I just bought a pack the last 3 days.  I hate myself for doing this shit to me. I am just now finishing the last one and I am going cold turkey.  Although I think it will be a lot easier this time because honestly,  it was mostly just a mental battle with myself.  I just thought I'd share my experience with you all and hopefully if you're thinking of smoking just one. Don't.  Now I'm not saying this will happen to you because I know there's people who were hooked who  can only smoke once in a while without getting hooked.  Obviously I'm not one of those people so now I have to start over.  My advice is just don't get too comfortable.   But if you are barely going to quit then all I can say is (as corny as it sounds) you can do anything you set your mind to.  Good luck everybody.

day 1 : please help me with any good advise

I smoke 2-3 cigarettes everyday for past 6 months. Today was the first day I didn't smoke and it's almost 30+ hours now I haven't smoked. I want to quit but can't control the cravings. Please give my me any advise that you did to help stop this f'cravings.

Update: Thanks everyone for all the advice. One of the advice that help me was to sleep. I slept around 8 hours and now after waking up I don't feel any cravings and  its 40+ hours. Next time I get cravings, i will sleep and reiterate this cycle until i stop. thanks again

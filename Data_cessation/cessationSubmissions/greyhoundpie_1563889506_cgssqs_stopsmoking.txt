I'm going to stop telling people that I used to smoke

Hi friends. How often, if you're offered a cigerette, or asked about it, do you tell people that you used to smoke but quit now? At least I do it all the time, but Im starting to see that I'm doing it because part of me still think smoking is cool and sophisticated and that I need to tell people (if they ask) that I did use to smoke, so I'm also cool and sophisticated like them.

I don't know. I'm going to just say "no, I don't smoke" if anyone asks or invites me out for one.

Any help you guys can offer... I need it

So I've been smoking for 3 years, at a half a pack a day but I used to be at a full pack.  I've been on this subreddit a couple times, each time with a different username, thinking I was done and finished with cigarettes.  I always just go back to them.  I've failed a lot at this point.  I hate smoking, but I've gotten so good at lying to myself, saying 'just one more,' or 'it's only one.'  When I CAN fight these lies, I just get depressed. 

I've read Allen Carr's book and it worked for a month, but then I went right back to smoking.  I'm seeing my doctor Monday, and my quit date is Sunday, but I'm so discouraged at the possibility that I'll just fail again.

I guess I'm looking for encouragement or advice.  I just feel like a weakling that I haven't kicked the habit yet, and anything you could say that might help is more than welcome.

I know I need to quit, but i'm scared.

I'm sure that sounds super weird, but hopefully someone understands what I mean. I've been smoking for ten years, since I was about 13. I'm tired of wasting my money and I'm starting to notice how winded I get going up stairs or on the treadmill at the gym. 

At the same time, I don't know what i'm supposed to do without cigs. This is probably super weird and i'm not sure if anyone will get it, but I kind of think of them as friends. When I don't have anyone else to rely on, I always have me and my cigarettes. I don't know how i'm going to restructure my day when I no longer take regular smoke breaks. I don't know how I'm going to handle going out for a beer with my buddies when we spend half the time on the patio smoking and talking. I don't know what i'm going to do when I need to just sit and think things over or when stress is at absurd levels and I get a panic attack. Smoking gives me a perverse kind of peace of mind that I'm not really sure how to replace.

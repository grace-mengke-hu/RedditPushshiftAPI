5 days in and coughing

So I WAS sick (cold) and quit while I could. I have not cheated at all... first time in a 25 year heavy smoker career. So sickness is gone but cough remains. Dry, unproductive but feels like something is there. I know it's lungs repairing but does anyone know if I can take anything? Tea helps but what about musinixs or something like that? Thanks all!

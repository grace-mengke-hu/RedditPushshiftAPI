Trying to convince myself smoking has never done anything good for me

2 days no real cigs. Got an e-cig and trying to use t sparingly. Hoping to cut that out in a few weeks.

In the meantime, I’m trying to think of why I ever started, and what good smoking has ever done for me. Like did the nicotine, tar and tobacco ever make anything more “fun”? Did it ever really make the stress go away? Did t ever really make me feel better about anything? Pretty sure the answer is that smoking has never done anything good for me.

PS, been a pack (or more) a day smoker for at least 15 years.

7 weeks quit. Anxiety revelation

I am so fucking calm now it’s unreal. Especially considering anxiety was my reason why quitting was so hard. Like heart palpitations anxiety for trying not to stop at a gas station. 

I bribed my self for a different addiction to get through the grocery store check out lines to help. Sugar. The two slices of cheese cake from the bakery was cheaper than a pack of cigarettes and I would carry it through the check out line. 
(Cheese cake to me is heaven and it worked) I have not gained weight and balanced activity and other meals to account for sweets. 

Now, I do not need cigarettes, I have dropped soda as I don’t need that burn feeling in my mouth anymore, and now I am working on cutting sugar because of my success with quitting smoking because I have done it. I know it is my choice and I can easily choose what I put in my body. 

Quitting smoking has snow balled into more healthy choices and much less anxiety in general. I want to be healthy even more!

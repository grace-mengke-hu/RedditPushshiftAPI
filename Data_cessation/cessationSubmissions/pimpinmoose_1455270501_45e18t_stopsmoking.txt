Day 3, feeling of guilt is fading away!

Hello everyone! It's been more than 70 hours since I've smoked my last cigarette I'd like to share my progress and thoughts with you:

I'm using the "Smoke Free" app to keep track of these things and in the last 70 hours, I've resisted a total of 23 cravings but 16 of them were on the very first day. It got better very quickly! I just remind myself of my goals whenever I get a craving: staying in shape and being healthy.

I still miss the moments I used to smoke while listening to Big Daddy Kane on a sunny day but I know that it's just the nicotine monster trying to be cute. I can still listen to my favorite type of music and enjoy it. I don't need a cancer-causing piece of shit to go along with it.

Another thing is the feeling of guilt is starting to go away because I'm not paying money to fuck up my body anymore. I'd become so uncomfortable whenever someone talked about cancer or illnesses caused by smoking until 3 days ago.

Anyway, I'd like to thank you all for helping me out and I can't believe how easy it is to quit when you take a moment to think about what you gain and what you lose by smoking. You'll see that you gain nothing, you become a slave until your addiction kills you.

Good luck to everyone, we can do this!

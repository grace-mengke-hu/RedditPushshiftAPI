Why, If I know that it’s bad for me, don’t WANT to stop smoking?

Been smoking for 5 years, 20 now. Should I just say fuck it and quit? Done very difficult things in the past, important things, but this feels like the most difficult one. 5 cigs a day. A pack on the weekend. Any words of encouragement? Specially from people who started really young.

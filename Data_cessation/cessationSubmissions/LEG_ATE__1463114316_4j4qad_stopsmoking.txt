emotional support for girlfriend that is trying to quit.

my gf (18)has decided she wanted to quit smoking. I asked her if she was quitting for herself and not me (I do not smoke). She said she really wanted to quit for herself. She used to smoke about a pack a day when we first dated, then a half pack. As of now she hasn't smoked for 2 straight days. I am super proud of her. I know the first week is supposed to be the hardest. I was hoping I could get some additional advice on how to be more emotionally supportive?

Feeling of emptiness

Hi guys, feel like I need to talk today, please excuse me for the long post.

So I'm almost at 12 days without nicotine and so far it went really smooth. I did not feel stressed out despite of my final exams being in a few days, wasn't irritable nor aggressive - everything was just going fine.

But today has been a really hard day, I stayed home all day and everything was going on my nerves. I spent the day playing games, unable to work, absolutely passive and without an ounce of willpower.

It already happened to me last time I quit, around the 2 weeks mark as well. I had loads of work to be done but wasn't able to do anything and it got me into smoking again.

I was wondering if you per chance would have some advices to give, if you happen to feel the same way, or if it's just me...

Thank you in advance, good luck and shout out to everyone up here !!!

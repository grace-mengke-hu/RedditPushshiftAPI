Working out instead of smoking?

Today was my first day, I stopped around noon. I was on the phone with my brother at work today and I just said flat out, “I can’t fucking do this shit anymore. I feel like shit, I smell like shit, I fucking look like shit.” I also decided now would be a good time to not look like fucking shit and start working out. Is this a good trade off? I’m looking to replace it since I mostly smoke out of sheer boredom and sitting at home pacing isn’t doing me any good. 
Any advice or routines that worked?

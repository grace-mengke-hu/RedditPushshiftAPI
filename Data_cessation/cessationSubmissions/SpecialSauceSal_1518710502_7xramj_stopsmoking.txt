Smoking dreams

I think I've had 3 separate smoking dreams in the past 3 months, even though I've been off for getting close to 3 years. They freak me the fuck out because in the dream I don't think it's a big deal and just roll with it. I am always so relieved to wake up and discover it was a dream.

What's your experience/coping skills with smoking dreams?

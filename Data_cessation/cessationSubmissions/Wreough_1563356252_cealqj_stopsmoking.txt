Abstinence and heart rate

When I feel the abstinence like aaargghhh wanna smoke now, my heart rate goes up and pounds in my ears. It’s making me worried. Is it a common withdrawal symptom? 

All the info I’ve checked says heart should go down, there is nothing about any pounding or increased heart rate.

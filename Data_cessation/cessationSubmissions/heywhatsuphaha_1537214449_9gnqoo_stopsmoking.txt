how long did it take you to get off your vape?

I've been using mine for about a week or longer, and I have a love/hate relationship with it because sometimes when I use my vape I end up with an adrenaline spike bordering on anxiety/panic attack, sometimes. Lasts a few minutes usually.

tips/experiences appreciated,

thanks.

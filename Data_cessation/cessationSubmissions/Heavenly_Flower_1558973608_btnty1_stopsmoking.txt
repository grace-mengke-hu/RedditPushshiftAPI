my dad is going to die

I’m fed up man, I’m tiredddd. I’m 18, my father has been smoking since before I was born (he started at 16, and is now 50). I remember being a little toddler and asking him to quit smoking as my birthday present. Anyways, recently his health has gone to crap. I mean holy crap he has been smoking for decades, surprised all these health problems haven’t happened sooner. The catch is I’m old enough where if he dies because of this, it’ll hurt more than if I was a toddler. I don’t know what the hell to do. He says he’s count down drastically (me personally, one cigarette is one too many), says he’ll keep trying but when when when when when. My life will go to shit if he dies, I won’t handle it. My stepmom can’t provide for my brother and I, my father freaking gives us food on the table, not to mention he my only living biological parent. I have offered to buy him nicotine patches, nicotine gum, vapes (yes, I know still bad), some magic pills that ex-smokers swear by, etc. and yet nothing ever gets into his head. Yes, smoking is an addiction I think everybody knows that by now. Question is, what do I do? How do I truly eff up with his brain where he psychologically cannot pick up another freaking cancer stick? Today, his blood pressure was through the roof, he was sweating like crazy, weak as hell, threw up, and on top of all that has had recent middle-of-the-night GERD attacks (the cherry on top: he is wayyyy overweight man and cholesterol through the roof, with a family history of heart problems). Sad to say, I wake up every morning expecting him to die that day. If anybody knows how to stop him or if anybody knows what to do if he died because I legit have to take care of my family and I don’t know anything, is there like a professional that one can consult on stuff like this? Just help please, thank you for reading and I hope your day has been better than mine :)

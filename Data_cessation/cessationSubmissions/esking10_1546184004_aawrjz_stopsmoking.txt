Day 7...

Day 7 of my quit... this is the second time Iâ€™ve tried this year... last time I got to 3 months, not sure why I stopped... just trying to remind myself that cigarettes do not actually help me cope with anxiety, in fact they make it worse. So glad I found this community for accountability and support.

Slow but sure

4 days 12 hrs in, cold turkey. I'm not sure how it's going...most of the day is one big craving...but then it doesn't seem all to hard to get by without smoking. ..afternoons are the hardest. I'm BORED!! I can't believe how much I've used smoking to pass the time. Longest...4...days..of..my..life. Seriously. Eating has become a problem as of day 3...I gave into some food cravings. Gotta watch that. Great right? More than one craving to fight at the same time. Ug. :)

Giving this quitting thing a go... Again

Over Christmas break, I stopped smoking. I wasn't enjoying it any more and I think I was just using it as an excuse to get out to stretch my legs when I was in work, as I sat and thought about it and found I smoke a lot more when in work.

I'm back now and I'm finding it difficult. Have any of you guys with better willpower got any pointers for me to try and get through the day without a cigarette? My coping mechanism is; I do not have one. I have my tobacco here as a "in case of emergency" and I haven't broken yet but I also haven't been this bored in the past week.

Thanks guys

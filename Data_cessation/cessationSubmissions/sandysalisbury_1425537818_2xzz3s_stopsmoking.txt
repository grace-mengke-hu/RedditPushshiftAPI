Mission day 19

Today I'm 19 days and 15 hours free from smoking! !!
41 years and many stop days, 
first week I used the smoking app several times a day, it helped because as I watched the hours, days and minutes grow I said to myself 1 cigarette and I lose it and start over. I changed my patterns of when I smoked, I'd sit in a new place, i ate pumpkin seeds and neccos candy to help curb the urges, I walk .5 to 1 mild twice a day and take deep breaths, I even take extra quick breaks to walk a few yards until the urge passed, which the did pass quickly
if I get angry I walk, it's really easy to tell you self I'm mad or people I quit for don't care so smoke. I know can get angry or hurt and don't even think about smoking, why because nothing and no one is worth given up the great things I'm gaining, smell, taste I feel like a baby feeling and smelling like it's the first time. it's become contagious people around me friends, family are quitting and asking tons of questions like how'd you do it after 41 years by the grace of God. if I'm really feeling like buying cigarettes I'll go to local casino, tram in to non smoking then out through 2 smoking rooms I guarantee within feet of entering the smell is so bad by the time I get out to fresh air I no longer want a cigarette. best of luck to every non smoker and people who are baby stepping. Honestly the first 6-8 hours was the worst it's all down hill from here : -)sztsgr

man does it feel good or does it...?

i smoked cigarettes and pot for seven years every day and promised my father i would stop. well i finally managed to quit both at the same time three months ago after smoking a pack a day, and an 1/8th of pot a day. i didn't slowly stop to quit i just flat out stopped. i was NOT ready for the withdrawals of stopping both at the same time it was a NIGHTMARE for two months. i finally am starting to feel normal but at the same time i miss being able to smoke still. will these feelings go away or will they be a demon the rest of my life? and any advice on dealing with anxiety from quitting? will that fade away over time? I've also noticed i gained a considerable amount of weight since quitting even though i participate in martial arts now and go on lots of walks now. i don't know to be honest i don't feel like my self since stopping. i have tried to smoke pot again about 4 times and all it did was give me a SEVERE panic attack/ anxiety attack. i now do not even bother to smoke pot. 

long rant over i feel better after writing that horrible formed rant but best of luck to everyone quitting. it can be done, suck it up, and you'll feel like a million bucks again!!

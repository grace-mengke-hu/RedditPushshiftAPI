Which reason gave you the motivation to stop?

I am really struggling right now, and I'm trying to remember the reasons why I decided to quit in the first place. The basic "it's bad for your health" stuff is not putting my cravings to rest, so I was wondering if anyone had some new reasons to give me some new motivation to continue through this proces of pure hell.

What made you motivated enough to get through the first months?

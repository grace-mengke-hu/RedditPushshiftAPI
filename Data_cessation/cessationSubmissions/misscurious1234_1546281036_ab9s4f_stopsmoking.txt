Struggling today - venting anxiety instead of smoking (for now)

Four months in and honestly, this does get easier. If today was like all the proceeding days - the good, the bad, and the ugly - I’d welcome it. But today is going to test me like nothing before. 

I missed a text from my adult son, who lives 2,000 miles away - he’s having emergency surgery today. I’ve been trying to reach him and cannot.  All I can do is sit and wait, and hope for the best possible outcome. 

Chain smoking won’t fix him or ease my ever-growing anxiety. But I’ll be damn if that isn’t exactly what I want to do while I wait.

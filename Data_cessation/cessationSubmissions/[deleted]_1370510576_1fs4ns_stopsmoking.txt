resetting my badge, keep fighting the good fight

all it takes is one moment of ignorance combined with an impulse for instant gratification, bought a pack, had one, coughed a lot, didn't feel any better. 

Tomorrow's another day, another day that shall involve toothpick chewing and an Arrested Development marathon (booked the day off work to give myself some time to sort myself out)

the people in this sub are fucking amazing, this sub is fucking amazing, just keep going guys, you're saving lives and extending your own and I wish you all the very best of luckEDIT - Cheers for the comments guys, I'm gonna come back here and have a read whenever I'm having a craving, you lot rock.

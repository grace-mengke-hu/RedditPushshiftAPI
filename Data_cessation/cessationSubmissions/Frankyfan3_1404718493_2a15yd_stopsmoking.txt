Went to an indoor smoking venue last night

And while I'm a fan of the place, scene & the people I am now sure that I will stick to their "non-smoking" night events.

It was stinky all night long, dancing was not as much fun since I found it harder to breathe & I am worried I'll have to get my stuff dry cleaned just to get the smell out.

What **was** great was that I wasn't even a little bit tempted to light up with the cool kids.

I kind of eyed the cloves curiously, but only for a second before thinking better of it. Silly addict brain, you'll have to try harder than that to fool me!

So much of what used to be a temptation is so completely off my list of things I need to do with my time, money & health. It feels amazing to be here.

I haven't really been on this sub in a bit, but it was really helpful for the first few months of my quit. Wanted to share, & say thanks to those who post & support.

Another day as a non smoker & it is feeling pretty normal. Thanks!

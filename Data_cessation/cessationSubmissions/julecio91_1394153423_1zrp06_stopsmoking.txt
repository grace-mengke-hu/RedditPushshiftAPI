Does anyone know any good anti-smoking educational ads/videos?

Hi guys,
sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask. I am working with students in an alternative school where smoking is an issue. I am doing a presentation on smoking and its effects, but as you can imagine text heavy/lectures can get quickly boring for high school students. Thats why I was wondering if any of you are aware of any videos I could use? Anything maybe you saw that was interesting, educational, or even inspirational. I just want things to vary throughout, I have already planned some activities and even have a lung demonstration. Again thanks for any help in advance. 

again sorry if this is a wrong subreddit to ask, if you know anywhere else I would appreciate your help :)

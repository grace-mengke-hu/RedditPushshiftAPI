I got nothing for my birthday. But it was the best because my brother quit.

So two weeks ago I had my 24th birthday. My brother is 16 months older than me. He started smoking several years ago because his girlfriend smokes. I've tried to get him to quit before. 


I've always been close to my brother, and watching him smoke and it taking a toll on his health was really hard on me. 


Well this year I asked him if for my birthday he would quit for me. For good.


I got nothing from friends or family for my birthday. But I did get to know my brother is on the right path and that's the best birthday gift I've ever gotten.


Do you have any tips coming from the smoker's end that I could help him with?

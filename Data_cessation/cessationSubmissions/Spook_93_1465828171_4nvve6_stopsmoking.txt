When you and your partner both smoke. (Any advice?)

My partner and I are both young parents and smokers of probably about 5 years each.
We split a 10 deck every day.
I want to quit more than her, because she really can't handle life without them.
I can go a whole day at work without and only crave one for when I get home sometimes.
We've tried quitting before, but it would make her act absolutely vile and depressing, until a huge argument would ensue, which would make me desperate to smoke.

As you can see, it's a vicious cycle...

I've been thinking about me quitting first, although I struggle when I know there are cigarettes sat there available nearby.

Any tactics/advice please?

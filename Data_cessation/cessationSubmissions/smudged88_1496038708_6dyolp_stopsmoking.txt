Tomorrow is the day...

 I've tried to quit more times than I can count in the 14 years I've been a smoker,  but lately my smoking is out of control And I'm really feeling it. So when I wake up it's a fresh start, no caving,  no excuses,  no " just one it'll be fine" I have to do this... any advice is appreciated... usually my emotions seem to get weird and I get mad and sad.... then I smoke.

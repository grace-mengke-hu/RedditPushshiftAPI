Small victories

I went to a wedding reception last night after a very long day at work. I had a couple of drinks, danced a bit. My vape was dying and I didn’t see anywhere to charge it, so I went home instead of risking having a cigarette. It’s been one month and 7 days since my last one. I didn’t smoke and my feet were happy to get home. I’m counting this as a victory.

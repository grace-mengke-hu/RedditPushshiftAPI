25 Days!

Hi All,

I want to you to know "THAT IT IS FUCKING EASY!".

 Don't listen and bend up to the fucking bullshit that it is hard and it is so big a sacrifice. Cut through the bullshit, clear the smoke in front of your eyes (like literally) and embrace the reality. It is fucking poison, a drug as lethal as any other banned drug out there. Just because it is fucking legal and fucking so common doesn't make it any less dangerous.

It is not a symbol of growing up,FUCK NO!. It's that we fell into the trap that these big tobacco companies laid out for us. It's a sinister trap. Their promotions are subtle yet profound. In movies, concerts...they hit where youth is spending time their most. They have some how convinced the whole world that smoking is cool and is a sign of good times, rebelliousness. 

It is stupidity if you see it clearly.

Things that helped me:
 
1) Not bending to the request to smoke along with your friends,peers just to not be the odd man out.

2) ALLEN FUCKING CARR!! That book is gold!

3) The hideous nature of the tobacco companies  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8

4) Cold Turkey! Waning down the number of cig's smoked wont help.

5) /r/stopsmoking!

Thanks guys and stay Strong all of you! :)

EDIT: went to have a drink with few of my mates yesterday, all of them smoked except me. :)

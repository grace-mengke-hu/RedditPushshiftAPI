Is the depression and mood swings due to quitting?

I'm on around Day 5. I tried many times to quit using the Alan Carr method. In fact, I tried using it over and over for over a year. This time I think I've finally done it. I used a combination of Alan Carr, aggressively meditating every day and have a plan of using "urge-surfing meditation" if an urge arrives. Interestingly, I have not been getting any urges unlike all the other times I tried to quit using Alan Carr. 

However, I have mood swings happen to me and days where I feel extreme anxiety and panic. I've also been feeling depressed, like nothing in life could give me joy and that I had nothing to look forward to. Again, no urges but other difficult thoughts and emotions.  Has anyone else experienced this? How long does it last?

Another try at quitting, hoping to replace my smoking habit with exercise

Hey everyone, just making a bit of an introductory post. I'm hoping this sub will help me quit smoking permanently. I've quit many times before, but it always pulls me back. I'm hoping to replace smoking with some jogging and other random work-outs, but I always lack motivation to get off my butt and do it! Plus without cigarettes, the anxiety and stress really kick in, which makes me even less likely to exercise. Any advice on this? Should I just wait a few weeks after quitting before trying to replace the bad habit with a healthier one?

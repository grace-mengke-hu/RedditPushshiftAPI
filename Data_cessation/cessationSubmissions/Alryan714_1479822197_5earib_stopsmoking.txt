Year and half check in

So I am a month away from a year and half and I been feeling great up to the end of October. My father is very sick and is pretty much dieing incredibly slow. Not to sound like a terrible person but once he goes he will be better off. My mother takes care of him 24/7 365. We have never had a great relationship for the long term. We are good for 6 months or so but than blow up at each other. But on Halloween she blow up at me because I picked making dinner and than going trick or treating with my daughter instead of taking her to the doctor for something that could wait. This than snowballed into her blaming me for caring more about my dad and my daughter more than her. I get she is stressed and it is hard to take care of my father. But they won't go into assistant living or hire a nurse. And she won't even apologize with out being so back handed. Going through all of this I have really wanted to give up the last year and half of work but I didn't and I am proud of myself. But I did block my folks from calling me and seeing my daughter and all of the social media I know my mom follows me on. I feel like a terrible daughter but I am also happy. I am confused but at least I am not smoking.

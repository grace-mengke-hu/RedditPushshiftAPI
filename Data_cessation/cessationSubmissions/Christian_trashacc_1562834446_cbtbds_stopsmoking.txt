Switched from tabacco to vaping 4.5 days ago and the cravings are hard

I've been smoking for about half a year but I decided to quit last weekend. I had my last cigarette at exactly 1:13 AM last sunday and been only vaping from then on out. I bought some nice CBD liquids and use two 9mg nicotine / 10 ml liquid with tabacco &amp; coffe flavor that my mum had from when she tried quitting (sadly didn't work). About half of the nicotine liquid is gone after about half a week and I'm still craving a cigarette every time I see someone smoke one, see someone pick a pack up from cigarette machines or especially when someone rolls one up like I did before.

I guess because the tabacco that's sold in bags is much stronger than prerolled cigs my brain doesn't even notice the little bit of nicotine I get from my vape. The last two days were hard but I'm staying strong.

Good luck to you all, just wanted to rant a little.

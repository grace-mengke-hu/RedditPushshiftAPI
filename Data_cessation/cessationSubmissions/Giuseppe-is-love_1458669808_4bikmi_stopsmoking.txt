13 days, having a hard time motivating myself since I quit

The past two weeks have been hard. Honestly, the actual act of quitting cigarettes has been way easier than I expected, I only crave them a couple times a day, and I haven't had much trouble being around my friends who all still smoke; one of them has a vape, so when they go out for a cigarette I just go out and vape. I'm down to eating just 1-2 pieces of nicotine gum a day to deal with the rough cravings. 

Not smoking hasn't been the hard part for me, the hard part has been dealing with my emotional state since quitting. I have noticed a severe drop in my motivation and an increase in depression since I gave up tobacco. I find this particularity strange since I'm still consuming nicotine on a daily basis.

I have a history of pretty severe depression, it has been getting better the past few months (usually gets better around spring time), but I can feel myself falling back into it. I haven't been doing my school work or cleaning my house, I just can't seem to find any motivation to do anything. I'm not even sure if these feelings are even linked to the fact that I quit smoking, but the timing lines up. 

Has anyone else felt a lack of motivation or an increase in depression after quitting cigarettes? even when they are still getting some nicotine?

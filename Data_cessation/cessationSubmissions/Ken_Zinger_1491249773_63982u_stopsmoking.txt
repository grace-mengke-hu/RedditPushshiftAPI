Recurring dream about relapse

Had it last night again. In the dream I am usually drunk and realize all of a sudden that without even thinking about it or being aware of what I'm doing I have smoked most of a pack of cigarettes and usually I'm at a bar alone in front of a half filled ashtray smoking another in the moment the dream starts. I am immediately so disappointed and ashame of myself and I think of all the months of progress wasted and how I am going to have to start all over again.

Forth or fifth time I've had this dream since I quit in Octiber. It's horrible.

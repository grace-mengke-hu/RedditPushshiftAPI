I'm trying to get my fiancé to quit smoking by making him a coupon book!

What are some motivators I can put in there that he can use daily? 

I want him to cash them in when he's having a hard time or needs a little push in the right direction. Some coupons I already have are: 

* Movie nights (his choice)
* A massage
* A steak dinner

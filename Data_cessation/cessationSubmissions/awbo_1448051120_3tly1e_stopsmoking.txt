Almost Caved in Last Night...

...but then I realized the following:

1) I would regret doing it after just one or two puffs, so I won't even enjoy a full cigarette;
2) I would feel miserable for hours, hating myself for giving in; and
3) I would throw away four days of not smoking, which many say is the hardest and most critical part (I would have to go to square one).

So instead of overthinking it, I started cleaning around the house, then took a nice hot shower, and voila - the worst craving so far was over, and I am happily on Day 5! :)

1426 days later, I have finally quit it for good now.

4 years ago I used to hate those who smoked. 

3 years ago I did not mind. 

2 years ago I loved what I hated. 

And an year ago I started realizing I had chosen the wrong way.

Now I shall quit. No more 'Just 1 puff'. No more 'Need with coffee' or 'Bad day' excuses.

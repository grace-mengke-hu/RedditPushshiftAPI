I dreamt I was smoking

This is actually insane how the addiction can get you. I dreamt I was craving a smoke so bad and it was going to feel so good to have one and I did and I loved it. I woke up scared out of my mind that I actually smoked but it was all a dream...
26th day in and during the day I donâ€™t really struggle too much but damn the subconscious!!

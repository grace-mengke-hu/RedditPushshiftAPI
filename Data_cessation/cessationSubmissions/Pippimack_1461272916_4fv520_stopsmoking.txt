Forgot about the fury.

I usually find the first few days relatively easy... easier than most other people report. I find it easy to enjoy not smoking any more and really relish the moments when I realise I would normally have a cigarette and now I'm free not to!
But this time round, I'm finding real fury rising inside me. I don't want to smoke and I'm not craving... but my nerves are jangling, I feel on edge and I can feel fury rising inside me. Last night I couldn't get to sleep because I was so angry, particularly at my partner for not being more sympathetic. 
I take time out and calm down a little bit - and of course I don't smoke - but the fury keeps rising again. It would probably be relieved by a cigarette but I know that's no good.
How do you deal with this anger?

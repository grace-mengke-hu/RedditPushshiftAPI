Slipped up again (haven't we all)

I had almost 2 weeks when last night I smoked a black and mild cigarillo. I believed in my heart that I "deserved" a "treat" after one of the most stressful weeks of my life and for some reason I thought that nicotine should be that treat. I don't feel any cravings and feel fine physically, but it is the part about my weakness that makes these slip ups so hard. I know that everyone has a moment where they mess up and that it is how you react to your mistakes that is important. 

I guess I just want to see what all of your experiences are with these slip ups and what you did to prevent yourself from falling back into the habit again because I am certainly feeling like smoking again.

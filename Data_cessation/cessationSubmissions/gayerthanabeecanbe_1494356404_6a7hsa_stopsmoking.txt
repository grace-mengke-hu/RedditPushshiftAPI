Quitting for good!

Hello,

Today I gave over 7 packs of cigs to my therapist to throw out (so much money thrown away.) I am a 16 year old who has alcohol addictions and smoking addictions.

Today I decided for myself to quit smoking, not for anyone else.

I went from 3 packs a day to 2 packs a day to 1 pack, and now i'm completely stopping. I know what withdrawal is like but I want to hold on to my youth. So much time is wasted on smoking, and I am tired of drinking as well.

Lets hope this is the last time I will ever touch a cigarette! Though
 the alcohol...well thats a work in process. 

I'm just wondering if there is anything to help with withdrawal, i never figured that part out when i quit. I am 16 btw, it is very hard to get nicotine patches. 

In California they passed a new law that you have to be 21 to get cigs and stuff, also to get nicotine patches. The problem is, no one wants to get nicotine patches when its already a risk to buy cigs. 

Well if you are reading this and you are about to quit, then good luck! I am proud.

If you have already quit and are reading this, then bravo! Keep up the good work :)

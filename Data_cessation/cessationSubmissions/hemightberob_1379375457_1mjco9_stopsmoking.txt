Hey Mods! Can we get a list going of all the apps?

I think there should be  list of all the iphone/android apps for quitting somewhere on here. Over on the sidebar after the badge instructions maybe? Every time I see a screenshot the first comment posted is "What app is that?" and there are a TON. So if we had a list, a person could put which one they use (if it isn't there already), add a screenshot of it, and upvote accordingly.

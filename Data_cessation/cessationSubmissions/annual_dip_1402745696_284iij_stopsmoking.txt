Day 1 (again)

I have quit smoking so many times over the past 4 years that I have begun to consider myself a serial quitter. It's become a running joke among friends and colleagues. I've had varying degrees of success from a couple of days to as much as 2 years. I've been using the Allen Carr method religiously and attribute any successes I've had to his method. I can get myself into the correct frame of mind to quit in an afternoon but I always tend to have cravings during familiar social situations around people I would have smoked with before. Those are by biggest challenges, otherwise I find it relatively easy.

Having gone through the process so many times over the past few years is a bit of a double edged sword. I know it can work but I'm also very aware of the pitfalls. Starting smoking again after being off them for any period of time isn't a gradual process, when I start again I go right back to the 20 a day habit. Going from 0 to 20 a day after being smoke free is like hitting a brick wall. All of the progress I made while not smoking seems to disappear instantly in a puff of smoke :) Diet and exercise go out the window and it's as if I had never really quit at all. It's amazing to me how many of my life habits are affected by smoking.

So here I am again at the foot of the mountain, with a 1 day badge no small amount of motivation and optimism. I have spent the past few days reading posts here and trying to get my head in the right space to quit. I'd like to thank everyone here for the advice and support in this subreddit. You've helped me to get to this point where I have that vital sense of liberation. I hope that my story might even resonate with someone who has fallen off the wagon and help them to get back on track.

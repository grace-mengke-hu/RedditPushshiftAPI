Day 6 and feeling good!!

This is day number 6 of smoke free, I am using the patch to help with the chemical addition but doesn't help with the mental and physical war going on in my mind..two day ago late at night I had the biggest craving I've had so far really thought I was going to have one, I just powered through it and it passed after 10 minutes or so...if I get a lot like that I don't know if I'll be able to stop myself again, hoping so!!

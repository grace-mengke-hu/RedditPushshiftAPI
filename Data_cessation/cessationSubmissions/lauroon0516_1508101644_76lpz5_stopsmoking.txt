Quitting Smoking...6.5 days in!

This is my 3rd attempt this year, after 16 years of smoking. I've gone 7 weeks and 6 weeks, and now again almost a week in. I'm very determined to be a non smoker!!! Every time I quit, it gets a bit easier... I think. Or I know what to expect. I still can't seem to find any constant relief for the "burning" in my lungs. I can't figure out if this is my lungs healing, or if this is a permanent physical craving I feel like I am going to have forever. I am taking lots of vitamins, I drink a variety of teas... ginger and peppermint mostly, I drink about 3 litres of water a day... all of these have a very temporary soothing affect. The problem is that even after 6-7 weeks of quitting, it still doesn't seem to ease up... Anybody ever experience this? Or know how long this will last? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

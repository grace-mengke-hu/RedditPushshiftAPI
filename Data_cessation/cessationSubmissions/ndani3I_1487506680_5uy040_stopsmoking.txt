This is going to work

Today is day 1 for me, I have tried a few times in the past, but feel like this time is going to work. I have been a smoker and dipper for 12 years, hiding it from my wife for the past 5! I did quit one time in 2012 for about 6 months but was stupid and picked it back up after failing out of a challenging course in the military. 

This time I am in a much different mind set! I am reading Allen Carr's book, and really feel like this is my time.

I will probably use this to vent if I start having problems as I have seen others do. I feel like the community aspect of being online may further my feelings of not needing these nasty habits!

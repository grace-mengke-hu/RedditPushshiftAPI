Last Hours as a Smoker

When I wake tomorrow the 1st thing I will do is destory all smokes I have at home.  Followed by a complete and thorough cleaning of all my clothes, car, and home.  I will pick up every butt laying around the outside of the house.  When I get the urge to smoke, I will do stomach crunches, push ups or ride my bicycle. 

Cravings will be momentary and I will work my way through each one as it comes and know I can beat this.

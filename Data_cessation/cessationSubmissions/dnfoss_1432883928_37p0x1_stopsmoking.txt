One month free

Hasn't been easy. Not sure it'll get better for awhile yet, but looking forward to the day. Have to remember I never wanted to in the first place, never enjoyed it while I did it, and am very happy to be free from the chains of nicotine. I remember choking down my first cigarettes, waiting till I could be "cool" enough to "enjoy" the cigarette.  
I think ultimately, the hardest part has been reestablishing routines. Not only do cigarettes invade every aspect of one's life, they steal the credit for every routine they leach upon. Have a good meal? Not good until the cigarette. On a nice drive? Not nice until the cigarette. Good chess game? Good book? Finished good portion of work? Watched a good movie? Made love/had sex? Having those routines thoroughly and completely reestablished without the freeloading bloodsucker nicotine in my consciousness whatsoever is what I look forward to the most. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. ðŸ‘Š

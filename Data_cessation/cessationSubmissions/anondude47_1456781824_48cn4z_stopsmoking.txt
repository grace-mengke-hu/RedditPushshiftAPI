Quit about 5 minutes ago

I've had 10 today. TEN! I've lost all ability to control and my work stress is going to get worse in the coming months. So. I've decided that enough is enough. No smoking or alcohol for the next few months until I'm sure I can control my cravings. I hope I haven't contracted cancer yet and the risk remains low for a 25 year old. But fuck it. I'll test myself after a few years and see where I stand. Wish me luck guys. And good luck to all of you already on your journey.

Stopped Smoking after hospitalization

So I am very young, 21 and I have smoked a pack a day since I was 18 years old. I had previously tried to quit and failed within 3 days. 2 weeks ago I was hospitalized for an eye infection 8 horrible emotional days in the hospital and I was able to quit. I am VERY happy I was finally able to quit, but I don't think I can deal with people smoking around me, or even deal with drinking.

Just wanted to say im glad I found this reddit and happy I kicked the bucket.

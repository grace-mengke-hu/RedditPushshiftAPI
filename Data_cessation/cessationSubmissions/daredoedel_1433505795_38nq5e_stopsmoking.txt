Im fit enough to smoke!

First of all, english is not my mother language so sorry for any errors! 

I did 6 Days without smoking (i smoke for 20 Years now, with the Year 2008 as a nonsmoker...yeah i did stop for a Year and began again...i hate me for that). 
At Day 4 i started running again (stopped for over a Year) and i did my 10 km Run in about 60 minutes. My Legs did hurt like hell afterwards but i was sure to not smoke ever again. I was feeling fantastic!


Now today i had a stressfull Day at Work and coming home in my empty apartment (im Single) i was opening my afterwork Beer and think to myself: " If you still that Fit you could probably smoke some Cigs". So i did. My Mind was fucking around with me. Shit! 
Tomorrow i will start from scratch.
I hate to be an addict.

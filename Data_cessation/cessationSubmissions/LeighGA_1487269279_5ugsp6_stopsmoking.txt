Day 12 – How Chantix Has Helped Me

On quit day 5 my mission on the app was to look up this site. I have to be honest a lot of the posts scared me; more specifically the posts about Chantix because that’s what I’ve been taking. My experience with Chantix has been positive: 

-I have been getting the vivid dreams and they’re wild, but I have never had a negative dream. They’ve all been positive and I can remember all of them when I wake up almost as if they happened in real life.  

-I’m naturally a very active person so I haven’t zoned out or acted like a zombie. If anything I’m a little calmer so maybe the Chantix has leveled me out a little. 

-I have been too proud of my accomplishment each day I don’t smoke to become depressed.  Every day I think to myself…OMG I’m actually doing this…I actually might be able to stop this 25 year addiction!!  

I understand everyone will have a difference experience with quitting and using Chantix and I think everyone should definitely monitor their moods. Keep in mind what the posts are saying, but also remember this is your journey and you may experience it differently. 

Quit day 3 was the hardest as far as cravings and I can’t imagine how much worse they could’ve been w/o Chantix. OH and it’s true what they say about your olfactory senses returning around day 11. My salad had WAY too many onions on it last night and I love onions.

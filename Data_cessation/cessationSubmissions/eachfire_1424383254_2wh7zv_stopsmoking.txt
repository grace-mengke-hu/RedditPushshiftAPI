I DID IT. Checking in on day 365.

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share with you all that it's been a year. A year since I impulsively quit, a year since I started running, and a year since I got on the road to adding fifteen pounds of muscle to my skinny smoker's frame. A year since food started to taste better, a year since sex got better, a year since I began to enjoy the long pauses after a meal instead of running outside. A year since I had someone tell me my clothes stink, a year since I was ashamed to hug my mom, a year since I worried about going on long drives or airplane rides. It's been a year. I made it. And I can't wait for the rest of my life as a nonsmoker.

I want to let you know that it's possible. Yeah, I've packed a lip or hit a vape now and then. Yes, I used a weird combo of the patch and the gum and probably clung to the latter longer than I should have. Yeah, all that's trueâ€”but what's also true, and more important, is that I don't smoke any more.

Alan Carr's book was a HUGE help, FYI.

Anyway, Quittit, I just want to let you know that you're a tremendous community and I wish each of you the best. I know you can do it. Because I did. <3

EDIT: thanks for the outpouring of support, everyone. PM me if you want to talk :D

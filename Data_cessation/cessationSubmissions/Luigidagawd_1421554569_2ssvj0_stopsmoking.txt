Smoke free for 5 days with a question

My throat still has this mucus in my throat that taste bad, I've had since I was a smoker and was one of the reason I quit because I wake up with a horrible feeling throat every morning. How long till this goes away? is this a normal thing for ex smokers? It never bothered me when I smoked only in the morning.

Smoking / Drinking

Well I am one month onto my no nicotine journey 
Going great tonight was my first time I have drank Alchol as a non smoker
I was dreading drinking wine with the thought I would crave a cigarette 
I only had 3 glasses with a lovely meal and did have the craving to go and have a cigarette but did not, so I take it as a step forward 

Thoughts ?

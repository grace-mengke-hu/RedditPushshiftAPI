Here we go again.

This is going to be the second serious quit of this year and hopefully my last one. I managed to quit for nearly 3 months earlier in the year, only to spoil it all by having a few crafty ciggies (the whole damn pack) on a night out. 

I've been toying with the idea all week, stopping and starting, massively reducing my intake but now I'm at the point it's starting to get to me. 

I'm not sure whether because I stopped for that amount of time I've felt relatively dodgy since I started up again. Time to get back on the mend and beat this filthy habit once and for all. 

No retreat, no surrender.

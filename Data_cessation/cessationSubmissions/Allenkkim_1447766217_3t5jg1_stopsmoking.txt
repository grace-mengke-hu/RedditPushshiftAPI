Question about Quitting

I've smoked for about 5 years, and I've tried quitting multiple times with either no success or short term success using all kinds of things like patches, ecigarettes, gum, and Etc. However all fails.

But this time I recently tried quitting about 2 weeks ago cold turkey and it hasn't been a problem for me at all. Like I haven't thought about a cigarette once and it's as if I've never smoked my entire life with how easy it is.

I shouldn't even call it quitting since mentally, it feels like I've never smoked a cigarette before.

I'm wondering how all of a sudden it requirs absolutely zero effort for me to quit when I've failed so many times before?

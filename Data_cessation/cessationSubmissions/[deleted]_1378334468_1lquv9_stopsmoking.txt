34 + years of smoking - Day 1 of not smoking started today.

Been reading through the posts here and they have given me inspiration to try to quit again.  So thank you all!!! 
I have been down this road before and I am hoping it sticks this time around.  If any one some words of wisdom for making it stick please share.

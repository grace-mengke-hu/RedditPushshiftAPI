I went 24 hours without smoking between 3pm Saturday and 3pm Sunday. A co-worker who does a similar job to me is on holiday this week and I have to do both of our jobs so I started smoking again for this week. It seems like an excuse but 24 hours was manageable and I can’t wait to start again.

Friday at 5.30pm when I get home I fully intend to quit forever.  I’m going to see the Rolling Stones on Saturday night which will keep me entertained and I’m going to make sure I’m at the gym Friday night and Sunday to keep occupied.  I’m sick of addiction as everyone else here has been or still is and can’t wait to join the smoke free club! Anyone else who’s thinking about quitting should do so when they’re ready but are more than welcome to join me on Friday! I like the idea of going through the exact same quit as someone else to talk and know what we’re going through.

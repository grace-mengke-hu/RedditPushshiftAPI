IT HAS TO GET BETTER THAN THIS, RIGHT?!

I keep reading that it gets better after 3 days, that's the hump to get past.   Not the case with me... I had my last cigarette Monday morning, I'm going into day 6 and it just keeps getting worse, everyday harder than the last.  I'm currently sitting up typing this at 12:30am because I can't sleep.  I haven't slept well at all this week.  I feel like I can't enjoy anything.  Everyone talks about "cravings" as if they come and go but smoking has been ALL I think about.  I've just been crying all day today, at the slightest provocation.  I'm scaring the crap out of my kid, and freaking out at her for no reason.  I can't go on like this, no way in hell.  It has to get better, right?!  I feel like someone is holding my head under water.  I can't breathe.

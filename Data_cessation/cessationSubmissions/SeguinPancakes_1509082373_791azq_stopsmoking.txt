I need accountability

Just over 24 hours quit. Dealing with the stress of infertility (in partner) and feeling guilty that I, the on again off again smoker, checked out fine. After that bombshell this week it's time I really commit to this before we start putting the time and money into IVF which we've been told is our only real option. I always thought I'd just quit when I got pregnant, time to prove that myself and my husband are worth just as much in terms of motivation than this unknown unreachable stopping point I used to imagine. This is the most stressful process after an increasingly stressful year, so plenty of new chances to practice alternate coping skills besides smoking. Here goes.

Quitting with a partner and it's starting to get very tense - advice?

Day 3 of no smoking (cold turkey) and I'm doing this with my live-in partner. He's one day ahead of me but I'm starting to struggle with our different responses to quitting. We were different smokers, him a chain-smoker only when out at parties or stressed, me a steady smoker, about 3/4 a day consistently but I never would chain-smoke a pack in one evening. I liked a few a day, he liked a bunch on the weekends or after a really tough day. His biggest concern about quitting has been the physical reactions to withdrawal, yet my reactions have been mostly emotional so it's been interesting comparing our feelings. However, I'm struggling now because his attitude is really negative and he's been so moody, whereas I'm trying to remain positive and have been very encouraging of him to keep a journal or write down his feelings about the experience. He's been so short and tense though, I don't know how to help while also tending to my own feelings about quitting. Anyone have advice on how to best handle the situation moving forward? How can we  support each other and manage expectations? I'd appreciate any help here, I'm starting to take his moods to heart and feeling super sensitive during my own journey to quit for good..

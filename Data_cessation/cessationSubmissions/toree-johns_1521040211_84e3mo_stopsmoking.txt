I broke 7 cigarettes.

Im quitting today after 5 years of 3/4 pack a day smoking. Im tired of waking up wheezy, and not being able to dance with my clients for more than 15 minutes without needing a break. I'm about to move to a new apartment and it would be wonderful to not have to worry about going outside for every cigarette because i don't want to stain the walls. I'm tired of spending 120 dollars every single month for something that kills me faster and stinks up the place. I'm ready for a new chapter of my life, and in this one I don't want to smoke. Ive bought suckers and butterscotch candies, I've downloaded the stop smoking app, I've warned my co-workers and family. I am ready to be a non-smoker.

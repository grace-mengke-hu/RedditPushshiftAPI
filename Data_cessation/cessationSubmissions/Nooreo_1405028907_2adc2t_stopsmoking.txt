20 days oh yeah!

So It has been 20 days since I've had my last cigarette, and let me tell you that the first two weeks were TERRIBLE! I remember the first 24 hours I already had a migrane. Then the worst part happened my sleeping patters man, it went from 11pm-9am (which was normal while i smoked) to 5Am-2PM and I would wake up about ~13 times through out the night! so I had about 1hr30 mins of quality sleep. 

Any way on my 4th day and so my sleeping patterns were still fucked up but the number of times I would wake up during the night was gradually decreasing. And whats strangest of all was my dreams they were SO VIVID. Holy shit it was amazing! I forgot what they were about but I was stunned when I woke up STUNNED at how vivid the images were. I knew then on that this nicotine thing was poison. I mean I woke up HAPPY, which is strange for an edgy NIN fan. 

After that during the 10th to 15th day I realized how much I loved to breathe, like I remember when i used to smoke I feared taking in a deep breath as I would start coughing as soon as I exhaled, Its like me and my body are communicating properly,Also I have to mention the smells which is awesome. 

Now that from the past 15-20 days(now) my cravings are less frequent and my cravings are their strongest during classes. I mean I was tempted (Slightly) many times to just quit this and go back to smoking but All I do now is take a good 3 minute walk coupled with deep breathing. And Im glad to say that the past two days I've had normal 7+Hrs of sound sleep. 

I feel like I owe my body an apology. So Me and My body have been going to the gym for the last 15 days and honestly I think all it just wants is to be optimal so HUMBLE are our bodies!. 

Thanks for letting me share

I'm quitting on Sunday. Give me the tip that impacted you most?

Back at it after a few semi\-successful quit attempts \(for 6\-9 months at a time\) after smoking roughly a pack a day for about 7\-8 years.

  Each previous quit attempt went surprisingly well for a while, but I **always** eventually fell into the trap of "just one," usually after drinking, then ramped back up to a pack a day shortly thereafter. I typically drink 2\-3 nights a week, but I'm going to drastically cut that down for a while to aid in quitting cigarettes.

  Anyway, **what tip\(s\) or bit of advice compelled you to want to quit or stay quit?** I'd like to build up a sort of "toolbox of motivation" along with some other steps I'm taking to ensure success. Thanks, and good luck on your journies!

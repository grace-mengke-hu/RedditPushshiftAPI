90 days...

I know my badge says 91, but on May 28th, my wife underwent major surgery and I smoked that day... but I haven't had one since! I understand if you think I should restart my counter from that day, but I proved to myself that I could immediately throw out the cigs and not look back.  I'm good with subtracting the one day and keeping my counter going.

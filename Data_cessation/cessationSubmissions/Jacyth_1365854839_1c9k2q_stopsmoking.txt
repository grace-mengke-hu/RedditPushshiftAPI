Day 4. Need advice on one small issue.

While my cravings have started to dial back, Ive been experiencing an issue I haven't heard very many people discuss.

I work graveyard shifts, and the last three nights in a row, I've had Restless Leg Syndrome driving me nuts! I tried some remedies I saw online such as taking calcium and potassium, as well as exercise. Nothing helps. Advice?

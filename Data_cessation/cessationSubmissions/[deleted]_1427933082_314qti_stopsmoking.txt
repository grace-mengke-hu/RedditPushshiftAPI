do any of you get pretty depressed thinking about the years you wasted smoking?

I was thinking about smoking today (not thinking about having a cigarette, just in general) and thought about the 7 or so years I wasted smoking. The damage the cigarettes did is done and there's really no way to undue it. All you can do is curb the damage now and avoid any future damage. 

I know there's no use in dwelling in the past, but damn. Sometimes it just hits you. Learn from your mistakes I guess :P haha

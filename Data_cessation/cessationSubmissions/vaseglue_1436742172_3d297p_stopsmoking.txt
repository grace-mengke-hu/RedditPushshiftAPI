Stopping Early

Only 19 years old but i've had my fair share of cigarettes already and am already getting sick of having a cowboy throat and coughing up phloem.

The biggest challenge will be resisting to have one when I get drunk, but i'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Good luck everyone else!

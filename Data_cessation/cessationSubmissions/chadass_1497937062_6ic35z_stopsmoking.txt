Advice for quitting while working in food service

25m, I've been a smoker for 10 years. The thought of quitting has always been in the back of my head, but the timing is never "quite right". 

For the last 7 years, I've worked as a cook, and always said I could never quit while I'm working in a kitchen, and I still believe that's true. 

Recently, I decided to make the switch to front of house, and have been bussing and hosting for the past month. A few days ago, I got offered a server position. 

Over the past month, I've been broke, and hand rolling to save money. Due to the cigarettes being much smaller, and the inconvenience of having to roll each one, I've been smoking much less. 

I thought about it, and it's very likely (due to my poor self control) that I'll start buying packs again when I switch to the server position and can afford it. I'll then end up smoking more again. 

I realized that I don't want to smoke more, and ideally, I don't want to smoke at all. I'm worried though, about having to deal with customers while quitting. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice from others in food service who have quit (foh or boh). 

TLDR; Recently switched from cooking to serving, and want to quit, but I'm worried about having to deal with customers through the cravings and whatnot.

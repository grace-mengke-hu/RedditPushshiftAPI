I keep resetting and I want to fucking quit.

My work is pretty lenient and a lot of people smoke on there breaks (which we get two of, but I can easily get more if I sneak around) and most of my friends go out for cigarettes on their breaks. I'm in a new town too so I don't have too many friends, but egghhhh there I go making excuses again. My ex got me smoking again (broke up two or so weeks ago) and ever since then I've been quitting and starting and quitting and starting.

I plan to quit again today (just had my last one 15 minutes ago) and I have one friend that we keep pushing each other to quit. Today I went ALL DAY without one and I felt GREAT. I spent my last $20 on this card that I can use ONLY at work to get snacks and healthy drinks, and felt proud (and damn those snacks were good, it's amazing how much you get your appetite back when you quit smoking!) and I found out that by using a pen to twirl (I love twirling pens ever since I was 13 and saw Goldeneye hahaha) I can really take my mind off cigarettes because I'm using my hand for something else.

Anyways, I don't run or exercise when I smoke and I went three days last week not smoking and ran/excercised twice, it was awesome, and the week before that I went a week almost (but that was when I broke up with my ex) so I was so stressed I caved again. Anyways, I'm going to try again tonight and I just need a little encouragement I guess. If I can not drink a single sip of alcohol for almost two years (thanks /r/stopdrinking!) then I know I can beat this shit, too, but fuck, there's been times where I went 150 days without smoking and I fell back into it. Ugh.

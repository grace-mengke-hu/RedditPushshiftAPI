Gonna try quit today.. again.. for the 5th time or so

Best run I had was probably 2 years ago when I quit for 3 months.. I had to move back interstate and soon as I landed and got into a car my brother lit a smoke right next to me and I just couldnt do it..

so I started again..

This time I am more isolated from smokers.. got all the usuals that helped me quit last time (nicotine losenges are epic) and I am going to try power through it again.

For my wallet.

For my health.

For my sanity.

Wish me luck!

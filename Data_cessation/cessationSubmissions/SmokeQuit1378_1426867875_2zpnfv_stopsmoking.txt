So I guess this is how I begin

I live in the UAE and I'm 15. A couple months ago I started smoking an arabic tobacco called [dokha](http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f112/slayer544/photo11.jpg) its known for hitting you really hard. I could get it myself and I loved it, my friends do it and its all around my school. So a month ago I was caught my dad smelt the smoke and called me out; made me throw it away. So being idiotic I just went and bought more. So I kept on doing it for a couple more months doing it 3-4 times a day. And that brings me to now. I was just caught again by my dad, he was furious and told me he would ground me to hell if he ever saw it again. I dont know what too do now; how to deal with my dad and how to quit now. So I guess I have to start somewhere.

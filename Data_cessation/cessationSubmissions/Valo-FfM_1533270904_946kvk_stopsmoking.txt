58h Without Smoking And Doing Fine

Hello StopSmoking,

just checking in and now I´m through 58h without smoking cigarettes and while using a Vape-Pen.

I feel great, enjoy the vaping experience and the occasional craving is so easy to fight.

The first cigarette in the morning was always the one that made me relapse, but I actually wake up and am happy to use my Vape. 

The vapor doesn´t stink, my lung feels better, I don´t have a nasty taste in my mouth, the taste I now get is a nice one and I am excited to extend the period that I´m smokefree.

This is such a difference between my previous attempts to stop smoking which ended up being a constant fight no matter which NRT-Products I´ve been using.

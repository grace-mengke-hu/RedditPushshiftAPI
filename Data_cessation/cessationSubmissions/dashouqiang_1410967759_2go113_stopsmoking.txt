Full and utter relapse: A cautionary tale.

So the first week or two is never particularly hard for me. It's usually around month two that I just get bored. I miss smoking. I blow a mean smoke ring. I have an oral fixation. It makes me relax. My friends smoke. I drink. I have a million reasons.

So around month two I started smoking a cigar every once in a while. They were expensive and sort of a pain in the ass to get, so I didn't fear it'd become a a habit. Hell, I'd go broke if I smoked cigars all the time! And the trip to a specialty shop insured I couldn't purchase them drunk at odd hours.

But that soon became a problem. They *were* too expensive. It *was* a pain in the ass to purchase one from a specialty store before I went out on Saturday. 

So I made it a bit easier on myself. 

I bought a pack of mini cigars rather than a single big one. That made them more available. One trip would net me 10 cigars and not just 1! And since they were smaller, I could have more than 1 in a night. Of course. 

But they were still too expensive. I'd spend 30$ on a pack of 10, and they'd be gone in two weeks. So one night I was drunk and finished my little box and got desperate. I asked if they had anything at 7-11, and found they had a tin of cheap mini cigars! What a godsend. Now I could buy those suckers for a low price at any time, day or night. 

The slide back to standard cigarettes took a few months, and I don't even remember the specific day that I said, "fuck it" and just smoked a normal cigarette. But last week I noticed that I huffed about 3 packs. A few hours would go by and I'd get that itch again. My lungs hurt Sunday morning after a heavy night drinking. For shame.

I'm back to day 3. Don't compromise, comrades. The struggle is real.

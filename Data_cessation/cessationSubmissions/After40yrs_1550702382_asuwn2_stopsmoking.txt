Meditation

On this journey,  I have discovered meditation... I look forward to my daily session, and at the point of the day I find that little goblin on my shoulder, tell me to "'just nip to the shop's no one will know" I can banish him.. And look forward to the day that the goblin disappears for good, and I'm doing the meditation just because it makes me feel good.

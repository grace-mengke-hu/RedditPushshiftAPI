Day 2: I want to *eat* a pack

Technically still day one, but I slowed down over the past few days to get ready for this. Genius that I am, I decided to drop my calories down at the same time (all of this to train for a career I want). Now I'm hungry and my favorite appetite surpressor is off limits. 


Brain has started with the excuses: "Not like you *reaally* have to quit" "You've only smoked like 8 years" "Your teeth hurt" "We're all going to die" "You have no one in your life who cares anyway"

On the plus side, I've been pitting my cravings against each other...when Im hungry, Ill turn my thoughts to smoking, when I want a cigarette, Ill think about food.

I just really really really really want to smoke right now.

This is going to be worse later on my overnight shift where literally every single person smokes.

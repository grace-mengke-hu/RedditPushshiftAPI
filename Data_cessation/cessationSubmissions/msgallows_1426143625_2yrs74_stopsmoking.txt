End of the line.

I quit tonight. I quit because I realized how much I was *casually coughing*, as though it were a normal part of breathing. I quit because in four days seven hours I will begin HRT.

For the unfamiliar, HRT means hormone replacement therapy. I am a transwoman at the early end of her transition. It's time to quit because I'm not going to sink untold thousands of dollars into correcting myself, medically, while simultaneously poisoning myself. I also don't want the increased blood clot risks.

I quit because I just published my first book. It's good, it's great, I'm deeply proud of it, humility isn't exactly my thing. I have more on the way. I want to be thriving in my life when, finally, my career as a writer is more than struggling with people on social networks to even read my stuff *for free*.

I used to think I would have to stop writing if I quit writing. I believed it was good lubrication for working. But it wasn't. It never has been. It's something that takes my hands off of my keyboard. It's something that pulls me away from my work when I run out, so I have to go out and buy more when I could just grab another glass of ice water and keep rocking.

And when I head out west next year for my adventures in canyons and mountains I want to smell it. I want to be breathless because of the scenery, because of the altitude, not because of paper wrapped ground up feces plants.

I'll be coming back here daily for support. I might not post a lot. I probably shouldn't. But Reddit was a heck of a resource for me in coming out as transgender and learning about a responsible course of care. I'm sure this network will do the same for me.

I want someone to hear this, that's all. I want to see myself saying it. I'm 32 and I've been smoking regularly since 14. It's over. So that's that, end of the line.

one week done. feel stronger. Thanks for all the support and camaraderie.

This forum has helped a lot. I smoked 8-12 cigarettes daily for 25 yrs with no break...but some times cut down to 2-4 for a few weeks. I quit cold turkey a week ago. Have a loaded vape with 3 mg juice in my pocket at all times, but havent take a drag yet. Wanted it for backup, so If i caved in, at least i wouldnt smoke a cig.

What I did was gradually make it a rule not to smoke outside office hours. So slowly ended up smoking only 9-6 on weekdays...about 5-8 cigarettes daily, and having clear no-smoking period from 6 in the evening to 9 in the morning. Then on weekends I started to really try to cut down and keep it to 3-5 a day. Once I was able to do this, then for a few weekends I tried to  go cold turkey and do 24 and then 48 hr stretches without smoking. Also got the vape and used it from time to time.

All this prep took about 3-4 months. Then I joined this forum, got the smoke free app, got the books of Allen Carr and made a note of all the tips and tricks offered here. Then went for a cold turkey weekend and tried to push on through the week, but caved in monday evening. On the friday of that week I tried to quit, but ended up smoking one around lunch and one around 5pm. That was the last one. Been a week since then. Hanging on. Didnt tell anyone till i made it past day 4.

Beating cravings - what's your method?

I haven't smoked tobacco for almost 3 years now, and I feel better than I have in years. The craving still comes back though when I am stressed, or drunk, or really in any situation where I'd think of having a smoke. Cinnamon flavored toothpicks have worked a charm at beating those for me. 

What keeps YOU out of a nic-fit?

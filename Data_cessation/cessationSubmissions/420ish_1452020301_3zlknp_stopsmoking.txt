15 days. That's just over 2 weeks!

I need a flair adjustment.  

I feel so much better.  I still have a bit if a morning cough but it's getting better.  42 and have smoked over half my life.  Had 4 years quit at one point.  3 years ago started back by a simple,  "yeah, let me hit that black n mild" 

From past experience, all it takes is one drag and I'm back to sucking that cotton filtered cock.  

Good luck everyone!

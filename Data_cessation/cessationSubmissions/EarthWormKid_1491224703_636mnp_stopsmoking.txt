Just woke up from a dream...

In this dream, I knew someone who needed a lung transplant  (from a condition she was born with). I was a perfect match to give her my lungs, so I said I would donate them of course. After the operation, it occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to go on a run right away. I asked my mom how long it would take to heal, and she laughed and said I couldn't ever go running without lungs. I also wouldn't be able to run up the stairs or do too much housework without taking a break. I thought about how I couldn't smoke weed ever again, but how this could be good because it would mean I could never smoke cigarettes. I still regretted donating my lungs, even though I had to do it. Towards the end of the dream, I thought about how, if I continued to smoke into old age, it would feel like I didn't have lungs. I woke up so grateful to have lungs, and to know that they are slowly healing since I quit, that I CAN go running, and at some point when I'm not broke, I can smoke weed too. 
 I know this dream is weird, but I just wanted to share! Thanks for reading :)

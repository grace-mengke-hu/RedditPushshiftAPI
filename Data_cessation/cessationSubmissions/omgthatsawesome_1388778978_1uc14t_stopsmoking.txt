Sooo.. 70 hours quit, I'm experiencing smell->color synesthesia.

Idk if anyone ever experienced something like this, but I woke up today after 2 days of withdrawal and immediately noticed something was "off". First of all, my sense of smell was working again, which was pretty nice, but in addition I could.. see smells. As colors. 

 - cue the biggest WTF moment of my life and two panic attacks in a row

I ran around sniffing random shit all day today and so far the synesthesia is still here. Nice smells look like bright colors (e.g. my pizza smells red/orange) and bad smells seem to look like darkish colors (taking a shit smells purple/violet). I don't know how to describe seeing smells, I don't really.. see them as I would see stuff with my eyes, it feels like the color is in my head but it is definitely there.

Like, seriously, what the fuck?!

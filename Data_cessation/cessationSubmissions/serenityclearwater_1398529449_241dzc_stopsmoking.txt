My friend went from a pack a day smoker to fully quitting using my advice (does not work for social smokers)

So my friend was a self-named chain smoker, but he wasn't quite a chain smoker. He did smoke a pack a day, though. One day, he came up to me and said "Man, I just have to quit. I can't afford it, my parents are yelling at me (he was 17), and I can't play football like this." My first reaction was just to say "So, just stop." but I thought about it, and realized he's probably heard that line a bunch of times before. So, I asked "Well, how much do you smoke? And when?" He explained to me, he smokes wen he gets up, after breakfast, etc. My theory was "You can't really go cold turkey, but what if we took out the cigarette before lunch?" So he tried that, it was a little difficult at first, but after a week he adjusted. Then we took out a cigarette between classes, and we just removed one a week until he finally quit. It was a long road, but I'm proud of him.

TL;DR: Try taking one of your daily cigs out of the routine, when you feel comfortable again, take another out. Keep going, I know ots a long process, but it seems to work

Bonus: Eating sunflower seeds and chewing gum helped his buddies, who decided they wanted to go cold turkey.

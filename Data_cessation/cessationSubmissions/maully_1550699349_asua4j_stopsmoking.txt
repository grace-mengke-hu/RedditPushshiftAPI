My grandmother died of COPD

I have been an on again/off again smoker for 12 years. I had quit completely for my wedding in September, but my grandmother went into hospice in January, and I picked back up to a pack a day+++. She died on the 7th, and listening to the nurse call in her cause of death was the slap in my face I needed.

My longest quit is 9 months, though I went 4 years on an ecig (which my husband hates). After my wedding I was off nicotine 100% for the first time since 2012. I am on gum right now, but in March I plan to drop it.

Quitting today

Would love to hear where everyone else is at with quitting.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished a packet of tobacco and I don't want to buy any more. I've tried to quit a couple of times over the last 2 years, both after getting over bad colds (caused by the cigarettes? hard to tell). Today I'm just quitting because I'm sick of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last times both lasted a month or so, but drinking was what made me get back on them. Whats worked for other people? I'm thinking I may just have to suck it up and quit drinking until I can be trusted, and also stay away from triggering social situations for a little bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried about it stopping me being able to get to sleep tonight, bad nights sleep and sleeping in the next day are really triggering for my anxiety :(

I'm so sick of feeling trapped by cigs in an anxiety cycle. Though I remember the feeling after the first week when my days felt so transformed and I wasn't trapped by cravings.

Good luck everyone :) would love to hear how others are feeling / any advice you have!!!

i know i can do it

i am literally exactly at 5 days smoke free and this is the hardest it’s been for me. i don’t need to smoke, i know how healthy i’ve been feeling and that this will pass, that i’ve moved on, i’ve broken up with smoking but my mind is playing tricks on me. i will not give in, i’m sitting here with a lollipop about to watch the tony awards, thinking about how wonderful it will be to watch an awards show without having to go downstairs and smoke and miss part of the show. how proud i am of myself for doing this. but i’m scared. i’m using the patch and i’m scared for the withdrawals when it’s over. i hate myself for using the patch but i need to. i’m telling myself when the patch is up it will only be hard a few days physically because right now is the mental withdrawal, the creation of new smoke free routines. it will get easier.

It has been 2 months and I still have serious nicotine cravings.

It has been a little over 2 months since I've lit up a cigarette, and I still have cravings every day. Is this normal? How long does it take for me to be fully free of physical addiction and mental addiction?

I expected to feel like this for the first few weeks, but the  cravings haven't gone away...

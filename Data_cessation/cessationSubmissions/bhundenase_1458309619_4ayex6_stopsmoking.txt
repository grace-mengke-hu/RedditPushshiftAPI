4 days now yay

the cravings are still there but have calmed down a lot. I usually talk to somebody when even I get an urge. Any other ideas? 
I used to smoke 4-5 cigarettes and and a lot of pot since 1 and a half year. But this past month was really bad. A pack a day was normal. Some things happened and I decided to quit everything.
I hope my determination stays strong. I feel if I can't stop now, I won't ever be able to

Edit : I fucked it up

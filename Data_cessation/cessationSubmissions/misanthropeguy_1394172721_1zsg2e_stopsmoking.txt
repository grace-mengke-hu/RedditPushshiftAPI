I'm going to try my god damned best tomorrow!

So I'm ready to quit, but I keep putting it off. I downloaded a cool app on my phone that tells me how much money I've saved and all the great health effects of quitting, but I just can't! 

So tomorrow I'm going to try again. I will come back to this thread in the morning while I try and beat my morning craving. I want one full day of not smoking at least! 

Ok, going to sleep now. 

Wish me luck!

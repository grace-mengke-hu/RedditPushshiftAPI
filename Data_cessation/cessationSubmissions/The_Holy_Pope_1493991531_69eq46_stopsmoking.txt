1 Year Check In

This is day 365 of the cold turkey. The last time I smoked was after a 3 month quit (with nicotine) after my dog died, and continued for 2 months through my 2 remaining grandparents deaths.

After Grandma passed I thought, "I can't keep making every emotional thing, whether I own it or not, about my addiction." That's been put to the test a few more times for me this year, with further deaths of friends and family. 

I lived half of my quit with my inlaws, who roll cartons of cigarettes and leave them on a platter in a mountain on their table. I think this, oddly, was a strength. Their smoking in the house associating with that pile of cigarettes really reinforced a lot of the negativity I was feeling toward cigarettes every day. 

I have a son on the way, due anytime now, and I'm happy I will be the first male of my name (in the known generations) to be a non-smoker with child. I could not be more proud of that fact.

Every day is no longer a challenge. It hasn't been for some time. I don't even remember when it stopped, but I know I've thanked myself every single day for not having cigarettes. I've held that fact as a positive through any of my negative times.

I hope all the people just starting get here. It's not far away.

Attempt #5 Since 12/26

I was admitted to the hospital for AFIB on 12/23 and to say it was a catalyst is an understatement. I know how important it is. But I keep failing... I can get through an evening and the next morning, but eventually the inner junkie voice wins. I’m so discouraged, but won’t allow myself to give up on quitting. I just want to get past day 1.

Hot Pilates &gt; smoking

13 days smoke free!! I can’t believe it. Cravings are definitely still there but definitely feel SO much better. I’ve been taking a hot Pilates class for 1 hour each day. It takes a lot of time out of my schedule but it’s the best “cigarette” of the day. Replacing bad habits with good habits.

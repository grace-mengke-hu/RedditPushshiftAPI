Girlfriend dumped me. She smoked pall malls menthol so I bought a pack because they reminded me of her. Has this ever happened to anyone else?

I was doing great, my flair says 118 days so far. Unfortunately I fucked up majorly by getting drunk and making out with a guy infront of her. She didn't appreciate that. She would always smoke these pall malls so I thought while the would is still fresh I'd pick it up again. Ruined my streak :(. Has a similar thing happened to you guys?

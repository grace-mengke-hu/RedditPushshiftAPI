Decide it's finally time to quit.

Decided to quit Sunday.  It's been on my mind for awhile and finally say I was done.  Had my last one this morning after  dropping off from a pack a day, to 4 to my last one this morning.  It's absolutely killing me.  Luckly my girlfriend is 100% behind me.  Hears to finally sticking with it and being done.

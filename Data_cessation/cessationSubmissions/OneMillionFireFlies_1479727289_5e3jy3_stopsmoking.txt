Smokefree for 150 hours.

Just wanted to share something. Like many, I have made several efforts to quit unsuccessfully. This time around, I am realizing why.

For most part, I never realised that I was depressed & smoking was fuelling my post-apocalyptic world view, & was probably Commanding it last few years.

This time, I am making a conscious effort at judging my mood swings & realizing that quitting has made me a happier person. I crib less, spend more time playing with my daughters, I talk way more than before & have a general positivity have not felt in a long time.

I am into 7th day of no smokes, so still not a well researched opinion. But I think a big part of quitting smoking for me was deciding I don't want to be depressed & unhappy anymore. 

Thanks.

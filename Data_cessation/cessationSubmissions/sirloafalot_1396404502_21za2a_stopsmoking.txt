Wow. 90 Days.

I haven't been ninety days without smoking well over 20 years. Probably closer to 25 if I want to think about how old I really am!

I've had an incredibly difficult time of it. I did not want to quit smoking. The only reason I stopped is for the health of my husband who was chain-smoking over two packs a day. I would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and listen to him wheeze in his sleep and that really scared me. Emphysema is a painful and terrifying condition and although we are in our forties, it still seems far too young to deal with those issues.

So, while I didn't smoke a ton, I quit smoking all together to support him because I love him and want him to live a long, less unhealthy life.

This subreddit has been a giant help. I check it every day, even on days I'm so angry and grumpy because not smoking made me feel like I hated everyone that was having an easier time quitting than me and that made me feel really shitty and dumb.

I don't comment much, but I promised myself if I managed to make it 90 days, I would say something as a thank you. You are all an inspiration. 

So. Thank you. You've all been more support than you even realize. Please stay strong because you never know how much your strength fuels someone else.

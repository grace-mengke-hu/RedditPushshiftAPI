Just organizing my thoughts

Hello all, I am on day 11. I have been using the patch to help me on my journey - yes I know NRT is controversial but this was the best option for me. I actually bought the gum too and have not needed it much- i just chew regular sugar-free gum now, and toothpicks when I am sitting at my desk. 

I have been on the fence with deciding if I should take the next step down or just get off the patch completely. 

I live with a smoker, who smokes indoors and that is why I decided to use NRT and wean myself off nicotine. I haven't smoked since I quit. 

It is funny/odd to me when I feel the nicotine coursing through my body from the patch. I am still on the 21mg and as I mentioned - I want to step down, and another part of me feels like I should just take it off tonight and not look back. In the back of my mind I tell myself, I have the gum if I feel like I need it. 

Actually in writing this, I am going to take my patch off now and woman up to this. Thanks for the read.

Any tips, words of wisdom or encouragement are welcomed!

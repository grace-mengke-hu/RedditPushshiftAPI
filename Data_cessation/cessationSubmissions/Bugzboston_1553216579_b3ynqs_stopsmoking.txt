Trying not to get discouraged (again)

So, today marks the end of day day 4 since a caved last weekend. I’m back on the patch, so not having any nicotine cravings. HOWEVER, still having major digestive issues (or should I say, lack of).

Joined weight watchers last Sunday. Felt I needed a little extra help in trying to eat right. Also have the “my plate” app to track calories, proteins, carbs, &amp; fibers. Been able to eat pretty close to my daily recommended amounts &amp; taking additional fiber gummies to balance out the difference.

Still have not had a bm since Saturday, but down 2 lbs (a win is a win, I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️). Starting to get uncomfortable again. Oh well.....

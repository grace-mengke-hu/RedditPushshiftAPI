Day 5! I can do this!

So 5 days ago I fainted, had cold sweats and jaw pain. Thought it was sinus infection along with dehydration. 2 hours later I have a shinny new stent in my heart and bunches of pills to take. 47 years old, smoking since 16. Up to 2 packs a day. 

Has been really wanting to quit before the heart attack. So far only a few really bad cravings, the thought of being free from cigarettes is driving me. Being able to spend more time with my kids and loved ones. Not planning things “around” cigarettes. Maybe even see some improvement on the “happy time” department. 

Been reading everyone’s post, getting inspiration, thank you!

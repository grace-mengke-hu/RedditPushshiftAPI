Day 2, yikes

I am a long time lurker, and since I decided to visit my family yesterday (who do not know that I was a smoker), I figured now is as good a time as any to quit. I was smoking a little less than a pack a day, so I was expecting the worst in terms of cravings. Yesterday surprisingly went very smoothly and I was in a fantastic mood all day. Today, however, the cravings came on hard. We were in a restaurant, and I literally wanted to scream, run out of the building and buy a pack. I didn't, of course, it thankfully passed after about 10 minutes. I don't really know why I'm posting this; I guess it just felt good to just get it off my chest. Thanks for listening, and here's to a smoke-free tomorrow!

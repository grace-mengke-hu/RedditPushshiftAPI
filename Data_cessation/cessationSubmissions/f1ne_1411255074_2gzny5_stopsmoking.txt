73 hours, can't believe it.

I am using an ecig. I haven't smoked since Wednesday at 6 PM. Before that, I was smoking about 2 packs of L&M red 100s a day. 

So far I have only really had cravings a bit after waking up because I want that strong first hit of a smoke which vaping doesn't give and during my lunch break at work, where I spend 25 minutes on the smoke dock and eat my lunch around 5-8 people smoking. My breaks haven't bothered me as much, as there's only been 3 or 4 people then.

My mouth feels SO CLEAN. Like, just got out of the dentist clean. I've been flossing a bit because I actually can feel little bits of food in my teeth. It's amazing, is this how nonsmokers' mouths feel? 

I think my sense of smell is also already improving. I thought that would take longer, but everything is smelling just a bit stronger... I can smell my boots right now, which I've never noticed before until yesterday. Nice leathery smell with a hint of feet. Heh. Maybe I should put some baking soda in them overnight...

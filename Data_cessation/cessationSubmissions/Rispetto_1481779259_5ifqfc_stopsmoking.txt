3 weeks in. When do I regain my ability to focus?

You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you haven't had a coffee yet? You're super groggy? It's like that for me, but all the time.

It's been slowly getting better, but it's still pretty shitty. It's almost like I'm dehydrated, but I know I'm not, and honestly it's making me want to start smoking / vaping again because it's such a horrible feeling.

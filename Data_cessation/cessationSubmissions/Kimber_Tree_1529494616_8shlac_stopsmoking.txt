Day: 2 / slipups: 1

Technicaly I stopped smoking around 4pm last monday. I had a cigarette yesterday around 2, but didn't enjoy it much. I really didn't enjoy the aftertaste! Yuck!

I'm a 30yr old female, have been smoking on and off since 15. I've been wanting to quit for quite some while now.

Mayor triggers;
Waiting/boredom
Fellow smokers 
Alcohol
Being angry/upset

Solutions:
I've purchased a water bottle to sip from when waiting 
I will tell my (smoking) friends I do not want to smoke anymore
If I do go out this weekend I'll stay sober

Furthermore I guess it's mostly realizing cigarettes don't do anything. Honestly I'm very nervous, but I really want it to work out this time..

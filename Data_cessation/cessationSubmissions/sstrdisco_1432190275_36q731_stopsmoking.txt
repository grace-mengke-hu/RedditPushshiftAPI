I almost missed it - I HAVE 4 WEEKS!!!

That went by so fast!

No cheats. No, "I was just making sure I'm still not a smoker." I've been actively using the tools I set out for myself to make this journey easier. I've been active on /r/stopsmoking and I feel that I've connected with some folks. And I devotedly read Freedom from Nicotine every day.

To everyone here who is working at making it work - you're doing amazing.

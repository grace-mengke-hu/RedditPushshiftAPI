1 month - watch out!

Everyone warns you about it.. "Watch out after 1 month, you start to get cocky and loose your guard." Same thing happened here! 

Thought I could have a few cigarettes during a night out drinking after 1 month smoke free. I mean it had gone so well for a whole month not wanting to smoke surely I could just smoke a few cigarettes that night?! Nope... 

Spent the last 2 weeks smoking as much as I used too. Even though it tasted awful and I could feel the effects of smoking on my health straight away. 

 I've set my quit date again and since last Friday I'm a non smoker again! What wil I do differently this time? I will resist the urge when out drinking and always be alert of the risks during a night out! Don't make the mistake I made!

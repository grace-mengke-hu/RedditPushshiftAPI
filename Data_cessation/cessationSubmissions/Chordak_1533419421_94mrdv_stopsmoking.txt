Nightmares (But In A Good Way!)

I've never felt more confident in my quitting. I'm just *done* smoking. It's *over*!

But I've had these nightmares (anxiety dreams) wherein whatever ridiculous, scary scenario couples itself with my buying a pack of cigarettes and smoking.

It's always really upsetting, until I wake up.

Then I realize that I've *quit*, and not *restarted*! **I'm still free!**

Good luck; God Bless You All! :)

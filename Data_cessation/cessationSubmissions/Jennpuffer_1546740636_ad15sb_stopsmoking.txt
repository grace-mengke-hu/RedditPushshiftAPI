2 Hours From Being 4 Days Smoke Free!

Hello All- 
This journey has started because on New Years Day I came down with Bronchitis and a Sinus Infection.  Which took me back to some years back when I ended up in the ER with Bronchitis. The Doctor came in the room, asked me if I smoked, and I said “yes”... continued by saying, “The way you feel right now is how you’ll be feeling every day when you have emphysema!” That right there was a total reality check! Yes, of course I stopped for a week or two but, you guessed it.. started back up. So, with the same thing happening 4 days ago..... I have made the final decision to QUIT FOREVER!! 

I read people’s posts on how it’s been a lot easier than they thought quitting- If that’s the case I’m going to have some issues. 

I smoke when i drive- definitely to work and long drives, I have a couple on my lunch break, and a couple on the way home from work. I know it’s mental but i also suffer from anxiety- Driving on the Highway and at night. Cigarettes are my mental cushion. I want to face my fear and be smoke free!

I feel like I’m rambling on, but being my 1st post my emotions are everywhere! 😳

I hope I will get some responses..giving me pointers and support!

Day By Day!!

Jennifer

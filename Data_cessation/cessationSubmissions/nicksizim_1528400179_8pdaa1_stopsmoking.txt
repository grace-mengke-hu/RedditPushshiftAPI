Vaping instead

Hi there. I am smoking a pack for 8 years and i'm 25. I tried to quit lots of times. Last week i was able to stay  smoke free for 12 days and then bad news made me light a cig. Right now i am vaping low nic liquid. I am wondering if my lungs starts to heal if i keep vaping? And my energy, taste, circulation, teeth? Is there anyone vaping and feel these benefits? 

If not, i ll quit them all for good. 

Sorry about my english it's not my first language.

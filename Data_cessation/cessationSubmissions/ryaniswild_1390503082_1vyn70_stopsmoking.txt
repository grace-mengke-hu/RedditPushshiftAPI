Day 5 - How can I make it so I don't want to kill everyone?

So I quit very recently and had been doing alright but today has been hellish. It's basically all I can think about and I have found myself getting intensely irritable with everything.

Smoked for the best part of 6years, probably an average of 3 packs per week and am quitting completely cold turkey. Any tips or advice on how to satiate the serious cravings and how to not feel so constantly frustrated would be amazing.

Thank you all.

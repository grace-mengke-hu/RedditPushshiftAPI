Quitting chantix

Who out there has quit by using chantix? My first go around with it six months ago failed, mostly because I was justifying a bummed smoke here and there with "well chantix is blocking the receptors so its not really smoking" which eventually escalated into purchasing packs that I would then throw away after smoking a few.

I didn't take my dose last night and was going to skip it again this morning. Around noon my wife took off for the afternoon and I didn't fully trust myself so I took one. I'm worried about life after chantix. Do any of you have advice?  This is currently the longest I've gone in 28 years without an actual cig.

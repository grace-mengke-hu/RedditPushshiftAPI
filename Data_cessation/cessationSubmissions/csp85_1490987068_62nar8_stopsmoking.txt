Third week hell-need advice

Hey, just need some advice. I am in my third week (17 days smoke free) and I am going crazy. Is the third week the worst for anyone here? How do you get through the cravings, especially since my cravings are getting worse! Part of it is nostalgia, and the other part is that I just feel horribleâ€“I can't even seem to focus on work. Thanks for any advice/experience. Basically, when does this end?

First time I've checked here in a long time. 800 days. Wow that's a big number

So much has changed since i quit smoking 800 days ago. I moved out. Got a new job. Got a dog to tackle loneliness (working on eventually getting a girlfriend) and just a myriad of other things. So much has changed I'm not even the same person I was 800 days ago.

One piece of advice. Stopping smoking won't completely fix your life. But it is a big problem. And the most important thing is the human mind can only tackle problems sequentially. If you overcome this problem you will find yourself moving onto other problems. And if you can tackle smoking you can tackle those. Before you know it you're knocking out problem after problem after problem. Radically changing who are you and becoming a new better you. Good luck to everyone!

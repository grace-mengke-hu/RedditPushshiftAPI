100 Days of Aaaagh!

Almost 3.5 months later and the worst withdrawal symptoms seem to be finally letting up a bit. Still dealing with some physical and mental stuff, but I am feeling MUCH better than I did in those first couple of weeks. Hopefully soon I can enjoy some of the benefits of my good decision. I'm sure there are some. :)

But yeah, one day at time. And thanks, everybody. Let's keep it going!

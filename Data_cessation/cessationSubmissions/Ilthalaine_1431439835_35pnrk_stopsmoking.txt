Here we go - again

After my last failed attempt, I started getting despondent. I really wanted to stop forever, but failed because I couldn't handle the withdrawal and had become incredibly grumpy at home. I had planned out a new quit date when my SO wasn't around (I don't like it when she's sad, and my grumpiness isn't good for her - she's a beautiful, gentle soul). I started doing more research - not directly on quitting, really. But more on smoking - why we actually do it. What happens behind the scenes. And in doing so, figured out how to rid my life of this disease.

I found a whole lot of information on whyquit.com - a site I only found out about via this subreddit: 

•	How smokers process caffeine at double the rate of non-smokers - so I should probably cut down my daily intake (cigarettes and coffee had been my staple diet for many, many years).

•	How my brain had basically reprogrammed itself, from the time I started smoking, to think that smoking was needed for my survival - on pretty much the same level as food and water! Consciously I know that it isn't necessary for anything, and that it's only ever harmed me. 

•	How the craving for a "precious" cigarette after I'd quit all those previous times wasn't infinite as I'd previously thought (but mostly felt) - that there is a silver lining after as little as only 3 days (on average), after which it starts dropping considerably. I've made it through 2 days - 1 more tough day one won't kill me! I’m going hardcore mode (as another redditer so wonderfully put it)!

•	How cravings usually last for as little as 3 minutes - not the hours it felt like. How the "omg I'm going to die - I feel like I've got man flu, and, and..." is caused by a drop in my blood sugar, and an increase in oxygen to my brain – levels of which haven’t been experienced in years. So I’ll increase my blood sugar levels naturally from now on, with fruit juice, mostly. I’ll also avoid over-eating (smoking causes your body to release sugars in seconds. Eating takes about 20mins – I just need to wait a bit longer for the magic to happen).

•	How some random “quit date” somewhere in the future will only delay the inevitable. I will stop smoking!

•	How doing this one day at a time will eventually get me to be non-smoker for the rest of my life. One day at a time!

Of course, this was just in addition to everything I already know using the Allen Carr method, and the wealth of information and experience shared by everyone here – you guys are simply amazing!

So when is my random “quit date” somewhere in the future? **Right. Now.**

I’m still at work – so I’m quite surprised. I smoked my last cigarette with disgust. I recalled how bad every single cigarette before it tasted and smelt exactly the same. I recalled the shame and disappointment I’d secretly felt every single time after I’d put out a cigarette. And I never, ever want to experience that again. Ever!

I’m prepared for the worst. But I know it’s not as bad as my mind is going to try and convince me it is. So, I’ve said my prayers. This is it. It will soon all just have been a bad dream that I will awake from as a **NON-SMOKER**.

Day 3 aka one of the hardest days. Any advice?

I have tried quitting in the past and it was exceptionally hard. My friends are really big smokers, so the temptation is always there. I left school for winter break and I am hoping that this short separation from them will give me the strength to ground my determination to not smoke anymore. It's been 3 days. I was fine until I realized that it had been 3 days. Plus, being home for the holidays is extremely stressful. Looks like I will be buying packs of gum in bulk. And advice for a 3rd time around quitter of smoking?

I quit. Chantix to the rescue!

So I came down with a pretty nasty cold last week and went to the Dr. While I was there, I told her about my previous quit attempts and how I really don't want to smoke anymore. She advised Chantix. I started it that night and continued to smoke through the weekend (despite nasty cold). Come Monday, I had no urge to smoke. It was like a light switch had been turned off. I am amazed by this. 

Side effects: I know there are some pretty nasty side effects that are listed, but all I've seen so far were some vivid dreams. This could be a combination of the cough medicine I was on interacting with the Chantix, but these dreams have stopped.

I do feel like something is missing sometimes, but there is no urge to fill that "missing" feeling with a cigarette, so I just take a walk around the office when I feel that. Feel free to ask me any questions.

Feel like I am going to kill someone

I woke up so cranky this morning and feel like I am going to kill the next person that is rude to me.  I woke up wanting a cigarette so badly and I know I need to go dun some errands and yet at the same time I am so worried that I will buy a pack.  Just need to focus on what I have gained over the past 8.5 days.

Didn't think I would make it this far...

but day 3 and here I am! My boyfriend has been quit for 3 weeks now and his perseverance really helped me to believe it's possible to leave nicotine in the past. I have been walking a lot more, waking up earlier with more energy, and honestly just feeling so proud of this positive decision I've made for my life. My new crutch: pistachios..seriously, a small handful (like 7 or 8 nuts) takes about just as long to eat as it does to smoke a cigarette. Anyway, I'm excited to be here and be a part of the awesome support in this sub!

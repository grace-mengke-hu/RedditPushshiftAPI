Meditation helps

So I quit a while ago last year, but then restarted the habit since the new year (opposite of a new years resolution it seems).

I've recently also taken up meditation, and been practicing for a few months, and on Monday I decided to just quit again, not because I was frustrated with cigs or so, just said from today I'm not going to smoke. I didn't really plan it, but I think it's a natural extension to meditation and why I'm doing it.

See a few months ago I started suffering from health anxiety, and general anxiety, also a few panic attacks here and there. And I restarted smoking to find an escape, and a few weeks later started meditation.  I think it really helps with keeping things in perspective, in clearing your mind, and in thinking before acting.

I'm personally using headspace now, it's a great little app, however before that I suggest going to some meditation classes to get the hang of it from someone who's been doing it for a few years.

I quit on Monday, and I honestly didn't have a single craving. I was smoking a pack a day, and I'm amazed that I don't miss them. Edit: Also, I have cigarettes around me, at home I have a pack and rolling cigarettes, but haven't touched them, and at work I've been around smokers who wouldn't mind giving me one if I asked. I'm simply ignoring the cigarettes. This was not the case when I quit last year, I was miserable, anxious, angry, and craved cigs multiple times a day. I think it's down to the meditation and the state of mind it sort of puts you in.

I would suggest giving it a go in general to deal with anxiety, stress, and to keep your mind focused on what matters or not. It's not a short term fix, you might get bored initially, or frustrated. Understand that it's a long term process and I'm sure it will help you out.

Thought I'd share my current experience :)

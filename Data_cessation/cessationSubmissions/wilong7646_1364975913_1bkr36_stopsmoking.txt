Lurked this sub for a little while, finally quitting.

Just about an hour into it, still not sure but I think it's about time I do something to cut my chances of getting cancer or COPD or any of the other horrible things associated with smoking. I became an EMT a few months ago and got the crash course on what it does to your respiratory system (as well as your circulatory and immune systems) and it was a pretty good wake up call. Here's to hoping it sticks. Any advice or motivation is more than welcome. Got a quitting buddy too, he's been smoking longer than I have but we both just called it tonight.

Cravings

Hi all.  
I'm on the last hours of day 2 and I just have to ask is it normal to have passed the last 2 days just thinking how much I want a cigarette? It's been mostly the only thing on my mind for the last couple of days.  
  
I had 2 top reasons to stop smoking, monetary and not being a slave to the urge to smoke. Pride is what is keeping me from smoking but with more days like these I don't know if I can continue...

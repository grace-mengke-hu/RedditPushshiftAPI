Week 3 off cigs. Day 1 off patches.

I'm still determined to stick to my goal. I'm just curious and have a few questions:

1). Will I go through withdrawal all over again? 
2). Will it be as severe as cold turkey off cigarettes or worse?
3). Will it last longer or shorter than withdrawal from cigarettes?

Should I have gone cold turkey 3 weeks ago and saved myself a world of pain?

My skin!!

I have been sort of not really/half-assedly quitting since early January. Only smoking when I was drinking, or just on Friday and Saturday nights. I had a cigarette this past Saturday morning, but that was the first in ten days. Now, I'm back on track and my skin looks AMAZING.

Keep it up, everyone! It's worth it for the cosmetic benefits alone! (Yes, I am a girl)

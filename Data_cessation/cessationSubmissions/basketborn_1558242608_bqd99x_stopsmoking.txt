How to manage relapse?

I know that most people have quit multiple times, so I’m hoping to hear what helped you quit the final time. 

I have quit three times, with the most recent being about two months ago for medical reasons. As the medical reason has become less applicable, I’ve caught myself being tempted and today I gave in and bought a pack. 

I know that each time I relapsed on smoking, alcohol has been involved. I’m considering complete sobriety. I’ve never had issues with alcohol except that I have relapsed smoking. Has anyone else quit drinking in order to stop smoking? What has that experience been like?

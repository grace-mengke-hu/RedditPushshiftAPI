Worst day yet - Depressed as shit at 33 days in.

Anyone else?

I had been struggling with depression before I quit smoking too... But the last few days it's been dark!

My doctor thinks it's a phase and wants me to stay the course...

Looking for other who has gone through the same at this stage of the quit please...?

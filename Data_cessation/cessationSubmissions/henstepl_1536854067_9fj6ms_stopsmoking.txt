Chain-smoking cigarillos for reading. What's an alternative?

I find it's very conducive to reading that I have something to smoke in my hand. On campus I used to puff at hand-rolled calea zacatechichi cigarettes: that plant does not intoxicate, but gives you intense dreams (it really works!) Now I have taken to chain smoking cigarillos.

I don't inhale, and I don't even get a nicotine buzz unless they're Game Leafs, which I do indulge in sometimes. So I wouldn't call myself addicted. It's just really helpful to have some secondary activity with which to punctuate the primary focused activity. (If I am without a secondary activity, I am liable to pull out my phone. Nope!)

I know that a vape would be the healthiest of all, but I have been dwelling on buying a big bag of some plant (**not marijuana**) and rolling cigarettes in an automatic machine I would buy. Has anyone done any of the sort? Do you think Blue Lotus would be good?

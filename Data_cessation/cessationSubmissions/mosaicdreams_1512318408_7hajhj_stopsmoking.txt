Today is the day.

I have been smoking since I was 15 years old. At 21 I had enough and quit for 8 months. 2 months after my 22 birthday I relapsed and decided that since I smoked I might as well enjoy it for a couple of days before I quit again. That was almost 4 months ago. I smoked my last cigarette this morning and put on a nicotine patch. I’m nervous this time around. Smoking is quite enjoyable to me. I’ll definitely miss it. But I know that the freedom I’m gaining is worth so much more than smoking. I’m always scared of the withdrawals though. It is seriously tough to get through.   I just have to remember one cigarette is too many and 1000 is never enough. I will never take another puff.

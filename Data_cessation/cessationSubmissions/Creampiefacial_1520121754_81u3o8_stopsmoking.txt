Day 1 and worried about gaining weight

It's been 24 hrs since my last cig. I'm not climbing the walls yet, surprisingly. I am, however fucking HUNGRY. Over the past year, I've lost almost 150 pounds, and still have a ways to go. I am terrified that losing the cigarettes will lead to me gaining all the weight back. It's important for me to mention that I didn't lose the weight in a healthy way. I cut my calories down to about 700 a day. How do I deal with this constantly being hungry and craving sweets feeling? I don't want to fail at either of these goal- they're too important for my long term goals.

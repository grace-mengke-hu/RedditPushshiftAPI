I quit smoking a month ago and I'm still having cravings.

So I've been trying to quit smoking for a while now and I cut back and cut back and I finally went cold turkey last month (04/24 was my last cigarette). I smoked for about 9 years (about a half-pack a day at the most) and I thought that four weeks would be the point where I would stop wanting a cigarette, but I'm still having cravings.

How long did it take for your cravings to stop?

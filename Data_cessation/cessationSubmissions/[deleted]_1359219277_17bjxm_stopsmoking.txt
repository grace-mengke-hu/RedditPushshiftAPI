I have tried so many times that I am getting angry with myself

The last time I quit was last Summer for around three - four months, Once I got back to university I started smoking again. It was a big mistake, recently over the past month I have tried to quit. I am fine until I have a few drinks, it doesn't have to be many but the urge to smoke is too great. 

I have decided that I am going to stop drinking until at the 1st of March and exercise frequently, this helped a lot last time. So far I am coming up to 17 hours at the time of writing this, a long way to go!

Anybody have any advice?

Can't get past 21 days

Hey there! 

So I'm embarking on my next attempt at quitting! Relapsed a week ago after a 20 day run, was feeling great and motivated, identified my triggers (think I have a booze problem I need to tackle also). It's crazy that I felt so good and I still returned to this shit horrible state ( the nature of addiction I guess?) So I hope this is the one when I break through the 21 day barrier and beyond! Going to visit this subreddit regularly which I have just discovered to keep me motivated!

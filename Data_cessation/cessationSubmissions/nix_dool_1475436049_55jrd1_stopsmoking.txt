46 days in. Biggest challenge so far coming up in 2 days and I'm really scared I might relapse.

I'm flying out of town for an old friend's surprise party. It's going to be a college reunion of sorts. Which is great, except these were the guys I started smoking with in the first place and **all** of them still do. There's going to be a lot of alcohol and a lot of cigarettes, even inside closed doors. The last week or so, I have been getting fairly strong cravings too, so the timing isn't great either. I can't not go and I don't want cigarettes to constantly be on my mind. I want to have fun without needing to fight myself. Ugh, I'm dreading the night when I really should be looking forward to it. Help!

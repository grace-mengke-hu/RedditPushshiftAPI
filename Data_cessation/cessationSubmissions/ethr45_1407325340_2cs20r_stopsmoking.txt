296 days!!! Thanks guys!

I didn't even realise how long it's been.  I downloaded a quit smoking app on the day I quit and completely forgot about it. Opened it once or twice. since then and thought "meh, who cares". If I knew how to create that tag or badge thing by my name I would do it because DAMN I'm proud 

Now look at me! 296 days, 16 hours and over 3,000$ saved. After pack a day smoking since I was 13 years old to now, I can't believe it. I don't smoke, I don't drink, and I eat healthy. WHO AM I? 


I love you guys. Thank you so much. Anyone who needs help or advice or at least just someone to talk to, message me.

Hard to watch movies and tv that glamorize smoking

I’m almost at 90 days, and I find myself going hours or days without thinking about smoking. I feel really good about that but I’m also finding it hard to watch certain tv shows or movies because they glamorize smoking or feature it prominently. 

I see them smoking and I think oooo that sounds good right now, so then I try to imagine the smell that goes with it and I’m reminded how gross it is. 

Any shows or movies you’re avoiding lately? The worst offenders I can think of right off the top of my head are Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire because they’re period dramas that are super stylized, and smoking is another glamorous prop to go with the clothes.

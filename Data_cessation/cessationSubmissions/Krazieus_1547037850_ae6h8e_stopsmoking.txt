Day 2 without smoking.

I made it two days without smoking, the cravings come on strong. Nicorette helps, only use it when I feel like I am going to cave.  I am using the gum as little as possible. I don't want to be still hooked on nicotine. I am trying to focus on other things like studying and playing World of Warcraft ( just started again). I notice it is alittle hard to fall asleep at night, I hope it is better on night two.  I am running and working out again. I am saving up to get me a nice mountain bike for downhill trail riding. I hope to be smoke free and back in shape by the time I get it.

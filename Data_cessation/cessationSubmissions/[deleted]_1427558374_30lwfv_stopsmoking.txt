I went drinking with my friends last night and I did not smoke.

This is huge for me. I was worried going out to the bars with my friends who are still smoking. It was so hard not to try and bum a cig from someone and feed the craving that gets so strong after a few bourbons. I can hardly believe that I did it and I feel so much better for it and I know now that I have the strength to go the long haul without cigarettes. I keep thinking about how I didn't want to loose my progress and my badge number. Thank you r/stopsmoking, I couldn't do this without you.

I used to see all "one year free" think it's impossible to not smoke for so long. Today I celebrate my own one year free. Thanks for everything, guys!

I thought it would never happen. And I almost missed this day if I wouldn't have put in an alarm for this day a year ago when I decided to stop smoking. I no longer even think about smoking. It's just disgusting in every single way.

You guys have been helpful as hell, especially in the first 0-30 days when it was the hardest. 

The best part about not smoking is the freedom to be honest. Not being a slave to somehting. Constantly counting smokes, calculating if I need to buy more, where to buy from before they close etc. I used to not look forward to visit my parents since I kept my smoking a secret from them and I knew visiting them would mean not smoking for 4-8 hours.

Life is great. Thank you.

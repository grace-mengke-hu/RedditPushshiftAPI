I found out I'm pregnant. Tomorrow is the day.

I found out almost a week ago and since then, I cut back dramatically. I went from about a pack a day to 1-3 for the last few days. Morning sickness has helped me a lot in this situation. But tomorrow is the day that I'm stopping completely! Halloween is an easy to remember quit date and I have to work for 10 hours so I figured it's perfect. 

This one is for you, future baby of mine.

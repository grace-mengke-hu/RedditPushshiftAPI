How was your experience with bupropion or some other medicine to stop smoking?

I did and after 20 days the medicine made me feel so bad that I stopped taking it, but by then I had already passed the withdrawal symptoms. 

But it did work. After 10 days taking it, I chose a day to stop between the 10th and 15th day of use and the withdrawal wasn't bad. However, after it, it was a horrible experience and I even became somewhat depressed.

So, how was your experience with Bupropion or other medicine to stop?

Day 5 conundrum

I'm using chantax and vaping and addy for focus, and a light antidepressant because Fuck it my doc gave them to me to quit smoking, so my cravings have been minimal. I'm excited about trying to drop down to zero mg nicotteen before I'm out of chantax because the stuff is working frighteningly well - I used to drink a six pack Or more every night and now I'm struggling to drink more than two... Its an awkward problem, not being able to sustain my alcoholism.

The issue I'm having is... I really miss smoking three cigarette and drinking a pale ale six times a night. I really enjoyed it quite alot, and I feel like if my gf leaves for the weekend I could do it with one pack, for half a day, and be right back on the wagon with my chantax and vape pens. I'm pretty sure I could do it and not feel too guilty if i still quit, which feels really inevitable (i know I sound like an idiot) in my current situation. My gf might leave me if I went back to a pack a day next week. I'm pretty sure it's never going to happen again. 

One last pack though? Talk me out of it?

Also, what do you do with your hands and face when you drive? Thanks!

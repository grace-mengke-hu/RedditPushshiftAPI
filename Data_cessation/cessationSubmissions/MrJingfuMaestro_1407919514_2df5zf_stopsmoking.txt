I am 395 days out and am so fucking proud of myself.

I was not a regular smoker but i used to smoke when i was out drinking and also when i was a bit stressed.

 I am so much more happier now, i go the gym regularly eat much more healthily. I am being lazy as much as i used to be 2 years back. I feel overall superb. I became even more social and in general just became much happier. I love Reddit and this subreddit. It has changed my complete outlook on life. Than you all.

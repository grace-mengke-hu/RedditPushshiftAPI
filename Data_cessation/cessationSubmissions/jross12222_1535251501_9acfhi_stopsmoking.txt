Quitting Juul

I'm probably going to have this post taken down on account of my age(16) but why not. I've been using a juul or any vape that has 50% nic since I was 14. I hate that I'm poisoning my body and that I'm a really trashy walking stereotype of a young nicotine addict. I can't imagine life without nicotine, I vape out of habit and when I get a craving. Those usually come every 3 hours and they hit hard. I really want to quit but I don't know what I would do with myself, so much of vaping is social and it would be weird because all my friends do it and I'm constantly surrounded by it. Any help is appreciated

Weird stuff

So I gave away my badge. I'll request a new one once I'm few days in. I haven't smoked today and I'm not planning to. Yesterday I had one.

The weird thing is that I'm actually starting to like the withdrawal symptoms. I like the dizzy spells I get every now and then, especially if I go for a jog or a run. Basically I get high on oxygen because my body can now actually carry that stuff! I also absolutely love the feeling of accomplishment I get when I don't give into the cravings and I get past one of them. My blood pressure is going down and it makes me feel a bit weird, my heart rate has probably never been this low either. Basically I feel like shit because of the withdrawals and feeling like shit feels pretty awesome.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this. I just felt like sharing. Maybe some of you has the same feelings I have? If you're still just thinking about quitting I say go for it! If for nothing else the moment you realize you feel so shitty it's actually awesome is a feeling worth experiencing.

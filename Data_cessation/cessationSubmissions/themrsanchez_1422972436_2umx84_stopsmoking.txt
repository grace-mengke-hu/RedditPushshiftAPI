One month free thanks to my bike!

I used to try to quit maybe twice a year, with awful results. But since I started bike commuting to work on november, I realized I was wanting less and less to smoke, until on december I decided to try (again) to quit cold turkey at New year's eve, and to my surprise, it worked! I've had very few urges to smoke (even at parties) and I can control them a lot better. I'd never imagined that something as simple as using my bie to work would help me so much on this area (and others, money specially).

Has this resulted to other people? Very curious to hear other experiences on this. Thanks a lot!

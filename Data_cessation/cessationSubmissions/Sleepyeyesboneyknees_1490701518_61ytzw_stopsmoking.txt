I stopped smoking Sunday night

Hey guys, completely new here but have lurked for a while whilst trying to get the motivation to finally bin the habit. 

I have smoked for around 8 years and am ready to give it up. I am trying to be more healthy and have found that though my body is feeling stronger with exercise i am let down by my breathing due to smoking. 

My last cigarette was Sunday night and I felt fine yesterday, today is more of a struggle, all i can think about whilst at my desk at work is having a smoke...What is the best way of coping with cravings?

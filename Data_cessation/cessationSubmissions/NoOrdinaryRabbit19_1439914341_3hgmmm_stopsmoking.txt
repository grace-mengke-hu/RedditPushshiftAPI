I didn't smoke yesterday!

Which is pretty huge for me.  In about four hours, it will be two days since I smoked.

I'm finding that I feel like it's not so hard in general, then a craving hits and it's **THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVERY DONE**, then it passes and it's not so bad again.  I just may be experiencing mood swings...

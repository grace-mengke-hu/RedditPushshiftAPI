Tomorrow is my last first day.

I have two more cancer sticks left. I've been reading The Easy Way book and mentally preparing myself for the withdrawal of the first week (which is always the worst week for me). I think I'm almost ready to kick this awful habit once and for all. I want to thank the people on this subreddit. Some of you have commented on previous posts to encourage and help me through this difficult transition. The rest of you have indirectly helped by making me feel like I'm not alone going up against the "little monster." Tomorrow I will add my badge, and start the counter on the Smoke Free app. Here's to my last Day 1 ever!

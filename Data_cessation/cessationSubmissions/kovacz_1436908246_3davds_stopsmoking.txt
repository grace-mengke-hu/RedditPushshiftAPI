Yesterday morning I smoked hopefully my last cigarette!

OK, I'm more forced to stop, I got a quite persistent angina tonsillaris and at least for this week I am not smoking. I've been smoking for 9 years and tried many times before to stop. Sadly my longest no smoking streak was only a month. But now I really hope that I'll never touch those things again. At the same time I really doubt myself, I don't know if I'll ever be able to resist the temptation of coffee and cigarettes. 
   Anyway, I've been lurking here for quite sometime, and thought to write this and getter all your support and encouragement.

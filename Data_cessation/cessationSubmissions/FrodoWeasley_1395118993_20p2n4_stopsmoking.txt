I'm 19 years old and I need some help quitting

I've been smoking for nearly 2 years now and I'm 2 days into quitting cold turkey.  The stress of school along with the sadness of nicotine withdrawal is bringing about some depression.  Somebody please give me some encouraging words because it's just so hard.  Thank you.

Sore throat after stopping cigarettes?

I’m 20(m) and Ik this is going to sound pretty insignificant, but I’ve been smoking about a pack a week for 3 months. I’m quitting because my throat has been really irritated lately after smoking any amount of cigarettes. I’m not sure if it’s just my smoke virgin body reacting to the toxins because most people I know who smoke a pack a day (20m’s) report no problems with their throat or lungs. I’m 48 hours without any smoke or secondhand and I’m just wondering how long it takes to rehabilitate the throat, and how I can speed up the process. Thanks for any advice in advance !! I won’t smoke with you guys today or ever again !!!

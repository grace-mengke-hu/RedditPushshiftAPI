Negative thoughts and relapse

Today, I told one of my best friends (an avid smoker) that I am no longer submitting to the evil nicotine monster and she didn't seem too impressed. I guess because she had a brother who quit for 8 months then got back to smoking right away, maybe she is expecting me to do the same, eventually.

We had a discussion (about her wanting to quit) over 2 smokes (she smoked while I just stood and talked - promise) and I really felt bad for her. Because, one day she'll try to quit as well and she'll go in with this negative mentality that might sabotage all her quitting goals and aspirations. The negative mentality of just expecting failure - and not any real success.

I then thought, maybe thats the reason why some of us here relapse. We let negative thoughts sort of take control of us physically when those are the thoughts that we should be fighting in the first place. I am only 5-6 days in right now and I really can't say much, but I do know that if I ever do find myself fighting my own mind to justify smoking, I will immediately say STOP. THINK WHY YOU QUIT. WALK AWAY.

That is easier said than done, I know. But, at least it is a plan ! 

I think that sometime thinking about these things really helps me cope and remind me of my new favourite addiction of NON-smoking. 

Anyways, 5th day and I smell/taste everything
I can take humongous breaths
but I feel groggy more often and want to sleep longer hours, is that normal ?

Side affects from quitting smoking?

I quit smoking about 5 months ago and was wondering if there are any side affects from quitting apart from the obvious sense of smell getting better and coughing. I have recently been getting random dizzy spells and would like to know if it happened to anybody else before I go to the doctor. Thanks.

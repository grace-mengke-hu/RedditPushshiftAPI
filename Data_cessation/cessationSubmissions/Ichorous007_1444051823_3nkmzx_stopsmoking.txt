OK I relapsed twice in the past 12 days.

I relapsed twice in the past 12 days of cutting cold turkey. Once was at a drinking event and I had one at the end of the night while drunk. The second time was this past Friday while drinking and feeling lots of anxiety and stress. I had three smokes Friday. I am acknowledging that relapse is sometimes part of recovery. 

I am also dealing with a LTR break up at the same time so stress levels are high lately. It's getting better every day and I am committed to quitting. I realize I am on the right path and want to be healthy. I have made major lifestyle changes like yoga and going to the gym before work in the morning. I am beginning to feel amazing but there are times I just need a cigarette because I literally can't calm my mind down sometimes no matter what I try.

Going to see dad.... No more hiding...

I'm so pumped .... I'm going on vacation to celebrate my bday with my dad and sister.  This will be my first time not hiding my smoking.  I also won't be a bitch from wanting a cig.  I don't dare tell them I'm at 75 days .....because they think I quit years ago!  Lol. (When I had breast cancer )  Let's be REAL NOW!!!!   NOW!   Best Bday gift ever is quiting that stinky habit! Holy CRAP! Rock on people!  Happy birthday week end to ME!  Boom!  Oh, and GO BRONCOS! Lol

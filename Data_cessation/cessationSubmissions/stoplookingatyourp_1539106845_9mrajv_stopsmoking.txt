Cold turkey?

Hello! I've been smoking for 8 years. I don't think I've been a heavy smoker. I used to smoke from one to 3 cigarettes a day, until recently a break up caused me to smoke up to 7 cigarettes a day (the day of our break up I almost smoked a whole pack). I deal with anxiety and it's certainly not helping, so I really want to stop smoking, at least for a while. Should I cut all smoking completely? Or decrease the numbers until I can quit it? How should I do it? 
Thanks! :)

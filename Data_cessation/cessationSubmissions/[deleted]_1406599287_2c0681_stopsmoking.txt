want to start getting in shape - any advice on starting from zero after quitting?

so i've just seen through day three (!!) and, if anything, i'm fairly underwhelmed by the ferocity of my cravings. sure, i've really fancied a cigarette a couple of times, but not found myself shaking in the corner wishing harm upon my loved ones or anything.

so that's cool. but, i have noticed my lungs get a whole lot tighter since i've stopped. i know this is part of the lungs' repairing process etc, but how long did my fellow quitters of reddit have to wait until breathing was no longer an effort/until their lungs started to feel less rusty and more lung-like? i really want to start running - as it stands, i literally cannot run a mile. does anybody have any advice on how to build up some aerobic fitness after quitting?

The time has come

I went to the doctor last week who said that I have early stages of COPD or emphysema. I'm only 45, been smoking most of my adult life (quit once for 5 years). I've worried about my heart health since heart disease runs in my family and paid no attention to how this was killing through my lungs instead. Monday 5/12/2014 is my quit date. Thanks for everyone's support and good luck to you

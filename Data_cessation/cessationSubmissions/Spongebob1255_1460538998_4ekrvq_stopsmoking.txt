2 and a half days... How am I supposed to keep doing this?

The cravings have gotten two times worse than when i was smoking. I started 6 years ago working construction and got up to 2 packs a day. Got down to 1 pack. Now half. Now im trying to quit for the 30th time. I want this time to be different. I feel like its going to be. But do these damn cravings ever get less intense?!

7+ years smoke-free, sudden intense cravings

I quit smoking over 7 years ago after numerous attempts, and I've been free, happy, even tempered, and healthy ever since without ever thinking about it. Starting today though I'm having some serious cravings and reminiscence for the stuff as if I never quit in the first place. Maybe it's because I've been hanging out a lot with friends who smoke, or maybe it's because I'm on an emotional/depressive low from relationship woes, but neither of those things have triggered cravings for me in the past since I quit. I'm not really sure why and not really sure if that matters, but I think I'm in serious danger of a smoking relapse. I tried making a list of all the cons of smoking, I've tried just sitting on it for the past couple hours, and I still want to go buy a pack, I'm at a loss.

Struggling under the stress.

8 days no smoking and I've been a little down and moody because of it. Today I was a little upset my partner forgot we had plans for the city and so said we should do something else. Got screamed at and told she hated me before she drove off, feeling really really low and craving really badly, obviously they can't handle me being on edge during this. Just want to give up and go buy a pack to feel better. What do you do under stress to stop yourself ? I dunno if I can.

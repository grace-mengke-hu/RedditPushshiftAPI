48 hours down and feeling good.

I have had cravings but overall I feel pretty good. I acknowledge each craving and tell myself it will pass. It is not easy but these feelings are worth it. Hell I'm having a craving right now.

I did not smoke today, will not smoke today, and it feels good to have that achievement.

Update: Now at 60 hours. Though I have a headache, slight craving, and snotty I am in the best mood! Just sitting here at work, feeling happy. Weird in a good way. Maybe it's the increased oxygen to my brain? I don't know but I'm just going to enjoy the ride. 

Yoga and binge watching Psych on Netflix definitely helped last night. Looks like lots of breathing and laughter are key :)

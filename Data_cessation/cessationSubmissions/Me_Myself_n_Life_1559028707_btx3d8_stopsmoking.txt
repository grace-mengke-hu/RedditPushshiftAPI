That would b right lol

So Iv been smoke free for 1month 14days now and have a varicose vein on my leg which has been sore for a week now so went to dr just to find out Iv got a blood clot in it ! Im taking tablets as opted NO to the daily needles to thin the blood a little but fuck me ... I wonder if this is common when U stop smoking ?
Thanx for reading and anyone else had this happen ?

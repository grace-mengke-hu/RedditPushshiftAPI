Feedback on cigars (and greenery)

Since we're all here to quit smoking and encourage each other to stay as a non smoker does having the occasional cigar once a blue moon a bad idea? What about the occasional bowl? I've never done either to excess. But I do enjoy a nice stogie with a glass of scotch every so often. Is that bad? Should that be frowned upon? I don't consider having a cigar like having one cigarette once a quarter the same thing as I think having any cigarette is bad idea. But I don't necessarily consider smoking a cigar akin to an alcoholic having a glass of wine at a wedding. Right?  I'm not trying too find validation or approval whether or not I can have a cigar or not but a colleague I work with thinks any tobacco product should be eschewed and made verboten. 

What say you?

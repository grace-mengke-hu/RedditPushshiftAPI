Day two, 8 hours into a 16 hour shift..

 x( ! First post here, but not my first attempt at quitting. It will stick this time. This time I'm gonna try new things. Like posting here. I'm tired of people laughing when I announce that I've been trying to quit... often while reaching to light a social (drunk) cigarette. (And yes, the alcohol is going away for at least a little while too).

I want to be done with this. I AM done with this. It's no longer an option for me. I already quit. Not a smoker anymore. Guys, I don't smoke! Not today.

Someone tell me about how their sunday afternoon is going..

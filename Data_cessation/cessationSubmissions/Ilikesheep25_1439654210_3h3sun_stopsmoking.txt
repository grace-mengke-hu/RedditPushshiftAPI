2 days :o

Feeling ok though. I've tried to quit many times but now its the last time. I'm reading the willpower instinct and its helping a lot! Other than that I'm very angry at people that why I isolate myself as much as I can. Mostly doing the reading, gym, walks and recently started cooking to keep me occupied.

I am really wanting to quit

As the title says, I am wanting to quit. I am 20 years old and I've been smoking for 8 years. From 15 to a couple months ago I was up to a pack a day, sometimes more, now I'm at about 5 to 8. I've gotten to the point where all I can think about is what I'm going to do if I quit and want a cig and it's making me want one because of the stress. And every time I have one it just makes me feel awful and I get all sad that I'm still stuck in this addiction. I am just hoping that some of you could tell me what helped those of you who were able to do it.

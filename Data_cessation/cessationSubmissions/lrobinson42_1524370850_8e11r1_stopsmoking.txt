New Cravings

I'm coming up on 8 weeks. What has really worked has been pretending like it didn't exist in the first place. My smoking friends have cooperated by promising to not ever give me a cigarette. To be mean about it if necessary. It hasn't come to that because it's been relatively easy. I don't have much of a choice. I'm getting dental work done and it came down to teeth or smoking.
The physical withdrawals are done. I suppose it's just behavioral now. I still love smoking. I still love the smell and the breaks and passing the time and celebrating and drinking and chatting with a smoke in hand. Maybe I need to choose to hate those things. I hope they just go away though.
I've had some good positive support from coworkers genuinely congratulating me when I've reached milestones and that feels really good.
Today has been hard though. I've been day drinking and have been socially triggered multiple times. I miss it. Usually when I get triggered I acknowledge it and just keep moving on. Hi...Bye. And that's usually it. I've definitely done that today but they kept coming. Different times and places. Different situations. I recognize it then move on.
This has been my most successful quit after 10 years of smoking thanks the ignoring the problem. Maybe I need to address the problem in order to truly let go of the crutch.
I've been holding onto all of my tobacco because I know from past attempts, tossing it causes extreme anxiety which leads to smoking. I think I'm passed the anxiety now and right now I'm going to throw it out....Nope...typing that is causing anxiety....doing it anyway. And I'm going to find some reason to choose quitting.
I'm not looking for advice. Just venting I suppose. Maybe a high five would be cool though. Yall rock!

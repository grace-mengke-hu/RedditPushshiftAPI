Way too much energy day 3 into quitting smoking.

Hey, so first some history: I've been 1/2 a pack to a pack a day smoker for 10 years, I just recently quit 3 days ago (cold turkey). It's extremely easy, like so easy it's a joke. However I have a dilemma, I am bouncing off the walls with energy, I went for 3 runs already today and the energy doesn't leave. I have so much energy that I can't focus on ANY tasks that I do. Even while typing this out i'm talking fast in my head. When I was a smoker I used to be so chill, slow and lethargic. And my first quit attempt a year ago I slept ALL day. What is happening???

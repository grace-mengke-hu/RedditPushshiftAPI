Heart attack at 34 years old..

I am a 34 year old female and had a heart attack 12 days ago.. Smoked for 20 years and have not touched a cigarette since the attack with the help of NRT. Scared to smoke again as this has been one of the reasons this has happened. Going to visit stop smoking service tomorrow for additional help.

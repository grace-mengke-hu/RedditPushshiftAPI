After going cold turkey for 56 days I made a huge mistake. So far I smoked 12 cigarettes. I need help and reassurance. *Don't see this post as a disappointment. I'm here to show you that I can stand up and fight again. And finally win.*

Yesterday I got high. I ate brownies. I don't know but I kind of got lost in my thoughts and bought cigarettes thinking to myself that this was okay. I smoked 10 cigarettes within 3-4 hours yesterday. Tasted totally pathetic felt dizzy as I was high.  Almost an hour ago I smoked 2 cigarettes. I felt sick and vomited badly.
My worries are

1. I didn't get cravings today. And I'm sure if I face any cravings these are going to be very mild. Right? 
2. As I didn't smoke for 56 days straight before smoking 12 cigarettes, I kind of still have my progress with me as I quitted again an hour ago. Right? 
3. Alcohol and marijuana distort my rational way of thinking, and kind of sabotage my common sense. I mean yesterday my own common sense was telling me like "hey a few cigarettes are just like recreational drugs,you won't have to smoke when you are sober".As I'm not addicted to Marijuana and Alcohol. My only addiction is Smoking Cigarettes. For the sake of my successes with quitting smoking I think it would be better to not use them at all. Right? 

Guys please tell me if I'm thinking right or anything that you would like to add to help me go with a working plan. I'm not letting my regret to make me paranoid and smoke again. I want to kill this addiction. I don't want to live my life like a victim anymore. If I could go back 7 years ago in time I would punch right in my face as I was just about to inhale my first puff. 

If  someone who messed up with a long quit and got back again on the track successfully, please share your experience. Let this thread be an inspiration and a practical guide for people who don't want to give up on quitting smoking. 

I'm not depressed. I'm just lost. Please help me find my path.

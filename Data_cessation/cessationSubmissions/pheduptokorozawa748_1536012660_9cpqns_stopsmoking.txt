Im A Typical Quitter In That I've Strung Together 1 to 6 Months Of Abstinence Intermittently Over the Last 3 or 4 Years

Ive been riding my bike to and from work each day for all of that time, about 3 1/2 miles each way. During this quit (that it may continue forever and ever amen), I feel like my lungs have opened up more so than in the past. I can push myself further than before. Instead of getting winded and winding things down at the convenience store, I can push on to the BBQ restaurant and beyond, full steam ahead. It almost feels like I'm in elementary school when I'd tear across the field running just because it was fun. I've tucked that feeling away for a Craving Day. 

Strength to all. Be healthy.

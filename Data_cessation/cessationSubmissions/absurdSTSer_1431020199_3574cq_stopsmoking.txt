From 150 Days Back to 0

I had a moment of weakness last night.  I've not had a craving in more than 2 months, but last night, alcohol got the better of me and I ended up having a smoke.  It was harsh, tasted like shit.  I immediately regretted it.  Posting here to hold myself accountable in addition to resetting my flair.

Stay strong people & don't give in.  It only gets easier as time goes on (as with most things).

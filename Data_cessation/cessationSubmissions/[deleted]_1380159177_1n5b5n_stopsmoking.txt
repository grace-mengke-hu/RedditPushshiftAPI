Not smoking, but quitting chewing

Hey everyone, 

I know this is a subreddit for quitting smoking, but I thought maybe some you would have some tips or any help.   I quit chewing about the beginning of June, 2013.   I thought I was doing great, but with the last weak I have had insane cravings and I have almost caved multiple times.   I have sat outside a convenience store thinking of going in and buying a can.   I thought I had the cravings all under control, but obviously I don't. I have managed to not buy a can yet or have a dip, but the urges are getting more and more stronger.  

I read somewhere that there are urges that could be seasonally triggered.  I can see that, because the fall I have a lot of triggers with the weather and hunting and many other things.   Tonight I went to the convenience store, but I held out and got a can of jerky chew.  

Along with this I read that after about 3 months, there are a lot of dangers starting up again.   One due to the seasonal triggers, but also because you have gone long enough to get the substance COMPLETELY out, and there are psychological hazards like thinking that you have gone three months and you can thinking that one smoke or one dip wont relapse you and that you can have it almost as a reward.   

ANYways, just seeing if you peoples have any tips or ideas to help through the beginning of the fall season.

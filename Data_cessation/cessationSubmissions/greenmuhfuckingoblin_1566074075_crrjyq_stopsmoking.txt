How do y’all fight the irritability?

I’ve quit three times this year. All three times were successful but were followed by relapses sadly. I really want to quit for good this last time but I am honestl so afraid of the irritability that comes with withdrawal. I literally can’t stand to be around people when I’m trying to quit just bc of how easily angered I feel over literally nothing at all usually. Any tips would be much appreciated

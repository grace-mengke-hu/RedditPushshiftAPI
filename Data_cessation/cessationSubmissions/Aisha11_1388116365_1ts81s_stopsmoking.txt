48 hours and counting.

For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to quit on midnight, Christmas Eve. Seems to have worked at least. I've managed to snap myself out of cravings pretty easily. Just so goddamn tired of the persistence of it all.

My 'previous best' was about 2 months, summer last year. Will be easy enough to take a full measure this time I think. Just need to maintain long-term resolve. Although, I normally live with 2 other smokers. When I go back there after the holidays, I'm going to be in a whole other world of temptation. May just have to avoid them as much as possible for a few months to be honest...

Went down to the pub tonight and got fairly drunk without any issues. I was drinking twice as fast as anyone else though...Gonna have to stop typing now. Just thinking about how I'm quitting is making things worse

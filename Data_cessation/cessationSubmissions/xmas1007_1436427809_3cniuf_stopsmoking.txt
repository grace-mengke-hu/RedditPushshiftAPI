Lost my freedom on Independence Day

I had gone three months without a cigarette.  Went to the lake for the weekend with some smokers and I slipped.  I have been smoking like a chimney since then.  Feel a bit deflated.  I have been making excuses to myself, even though I know its the nicotine talking.  More than anything I am just dreading the withdrawals again even though I know the longer I wait the worse it will be.

As long as I'm successful at not picking up a smoke, failure remains just around the corner- an arm's length away.

I'm on day 2.5, & I feel like saying 'F- it', which worries me since I feel so close to failing this most recent attempt to quit. To make things worse, I understand that as long as I stay quit, it's oh so simple for me to simply light one up- & thus fail. The cravings don't seem to run out anymore today like they did yesterday. They keep eroding my willpower. I don't know what to do to get through them. I'm in the middle of watching the Alan Carr book on YouTube- & it gives me cravings watching the people smoke. I about lost it when it was at the part where he says 'go ahead & smoke'. As much as I'd like to (very much), I don't feel that's an option for me. So I continue smokeless & fighting a seemingly failure-prone battle with the cravings. I worry it's just a matter of time until I fail & have a smoke. I need to stay stopped. Can't let myself fail.

Can you freaking believe it?

Can you? Look at us New Years non-smokers! In few short hours, we will be in week 4!!!!! FOUR! I really can't believe this is happening. This is the longest I went! It feels so good! 

- I love how my car doesn't stink and it's clean now! No more ashes in the back seat! No more cigarette smell!
- My energy! OMG, I have so much energy!
- I sleep sooooo good! I wake up early too! I am not tired in the morning!
- I saved over 100 bucks! 
- I don't have to go outside with my co-worker anymore to freeze my ass off. Plus, it looks good at work that I don't smoke and constantly not go out to smoke. It stinks too!
- I got my teeth cleaned during my periodic visit. They feel so clean. I can't wait for my dentist to see me in 3 months again and notice the difference!
- I am a NON SMOKER. I don't smoke! I am in that elite club. Yup...non smoker! 
- My lungs feel sooo much better. I can breathe! Take deep breaths! I love it!
- My girlfriend loves it :)
- I am not a slave anymore. I got this shit!

Common peeps! Let's keep on rolling! Soon we will be one month in! There is no going back to that crap! How the hell could we smoke before? This is so awesome not to smoke.

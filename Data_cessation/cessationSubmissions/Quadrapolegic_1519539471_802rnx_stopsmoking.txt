Just about to finish my first day with out tobacco.

I am just about to finish my first day in a long time without tobacco.    Normally I would reward myself by having a cigar,  not this time.  I am trying to quit all tobacco.  I have nicorette,  and I am using it.  I normally reserve the nicorette for work where I can't smoke or leave to have a cigarette.  I have tried to quit smoking before and gone a day with out cigarettes only to buy a cigar and then another or two.  I have now made up my mind to quit.  I hope it works.

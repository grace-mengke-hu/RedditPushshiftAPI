Trick to quit

Today is one year smoke free. I just want to share a trick that worked for me. A month before the day you quit begin to practice this exercise.

Every time you smoke meditate on your cigarette. Look at it notice the smoke in your lungs. This gets hard to do so take your time and be patient. By the time your quit day rolls around you will be ready.

Next as you feel cravings meditate on the present moment feel the clean air you breath into your lungs, remember how ugly your burning cigarette used to look.

Going forward never forget that if you have one puff off of one cigarette it was all for nothing.

I have quit before for 4 years and started again because of an emotional time and it took another four years to try again.

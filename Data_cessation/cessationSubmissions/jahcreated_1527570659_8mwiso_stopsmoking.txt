Wow!!!

This is sight/community/...whatever is SO INSPIRING!!! I’m going on 5 days not smoking (but vaping low nic 3mg).  I started smoking when I was 18....stopped/quit when I was 26 cold turkey!!! Did not smoke for 19 years...started stressing (life) and started smoking again!!! Decided to quit again...5 days ago as I was up to smoking a pack a day and started going beyond that pack ago!  Just reading the comments is inspirational and let’s me know that I am not alone doing this!! God bless to all and may we all be successful in not smoking!!!

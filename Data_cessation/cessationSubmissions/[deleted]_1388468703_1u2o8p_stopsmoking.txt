Okay, I'm trying to escape

after 4.5 years of smoking, I going to trying to escape this time. 

I hope this is my final attempt.

I've quit poker. I've quit games. I've quit hard drugs. 

But this nicotine monkey is a demon that has conquered me for too long.

I'm only 1/2 done the Allen Carr book and I think I get the gist of the re-framing technique he employs. 

wish me luck, and I'll update the results after 3 weeks

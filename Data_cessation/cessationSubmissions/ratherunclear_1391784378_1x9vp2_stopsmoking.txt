What if I was a light smoker?

Okay, so after one day of not smoking, I was confronted with the sad truth that the physical withdrawals are a very real thing after all. I feel like a child asking for an unrealistic affirmation right now but I sort of want someone to tell me that, since I was only smoking five cigarettes a day, the withdrawal process will not go on for as long as a pack-a-day smoker.

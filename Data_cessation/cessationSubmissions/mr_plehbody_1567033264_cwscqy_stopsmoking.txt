Juul quitters role call!

I just dropped my juul 3 days ago. I used to smoke 1-2 pods a day and did it for about a year.

Feels good to not puff on it right now, but I am feeling so foggy and confused. I also have some restless leg syndrome going on. 

Who else is on the no juul journey as we speak? How far are you? How is your day going? Better or worse than when you first quit?

My first day was a serious nightmare, so everything has been easy relatively, occasionally forgetting that Iâ€™m a bit deprived when focusing on work. Hope everyone is doing okay! It can be rough

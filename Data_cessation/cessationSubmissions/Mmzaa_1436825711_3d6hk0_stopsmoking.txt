Day One, cold turkey, 9 years of smoking.

Hey there !
I have been planning to quit for a while now, and I discovered this subreddit last week... What a great find, this is already helping a lot ! Thank you guys so much.

Anyways. I'm a 24 years old female, I've been a smoker for 9 years (or 8 ^1/2, can't recall), 1 pack a day for the last 2 ^1/2 years. Never quit before... I didn't feel ready. BUT today is my first nicotine-free day in 9 years ! I'm feeling very proud !
Considering how much reading about other smokers' experiences and also this [Stop Smoking Recovery Timetable] (http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html) helped, I thought I should write about my own time quitting cigarettes. This is both therapeutic, for me, and hopefully, helpful for others. **It is also very long, but I made a TL;DR with a list of the symptoms**.

------
I had planned ahead that today was going to be *the* day. That is something I need to do before making a big change, I have to set a date ahead of time, to prepare myself. I spent the last week terrified of this very day. After gathering infos, and based on some friends' experiences, I chose to do it cold turkey.

Yesterday I read Alan Carr's book before going to sleep. I was exhausted so I fell asleep but finished it this morning, as I woke up. So far I find it quite helpful, it made me reconsider a lot of what I thought about cigarettes and my own addiction. I try to think about it every time I have a craving, and it gives me strength and motivation. I don't want to be a smoker any more.

First there was fatigue. I felt (still feel !) light-headed, aloof, almost dizzy. Something also feels weird about my vision. 

As it is my first attempt, I am quite fascinated by all the symptoms. This is keeping me going. So the mood isn't too bad, at H+9. I marvel at the number of ways my addiction is trying out to make me relapse. Most of all it's like I forget cigarettes ever existed, but suddenly I remember how good they are, and how I can't have them anymore. It's a very fast-happening and severe emotional rollercoaster. And it happens every 5 to 10 min, or so it feels.

Then the much-dreaded first meal. I was very hungry, not sure if that was nicotine related. But the trigger was such a pain ! Still now, every time I eat. These are the worst ! But I expect them.
The dizziness is still here. I sometimes burst out laughing at how much I wanna smoke. 

And then suddenly, the most unexpected side effect at H+11. I started crying uncontrollably. Ugly crying, really, sobbing so hard. It lasted for something like 5 min and I couldn't do anything but cry, so I took a cold shower, which helped. This was very impressive.

But the worst side effect so far is how out of it I am. Out of it all. I feel so intellectually diminished. I cannot focus at all ! I can't think of anything else. I can't ever remember anything from one minute to the next so I'm writing it all down ("take a shower, get dressed"). I forget words, ideas, I stutter. I had planned things so that I would keep busy, but at that moment I'm not feeling up to anything but staring in the distance and waiting for it to be over. This side effect lasted for 5 to 6 hours in total, from slight to severe and then disappeared. Right now I still don't feel 100% so I'm sorry if this is a pain to read or too full of mistakes.

Around H+15 the cravings are more distant. I can actually focus on things. Which means I can forget about cigarettes for short periods of time ! I start feeling more energetic. Or rather, less incapacitated. 

I found out gum is helping, so I chew every time I have a craving. Or I drink Diet Coke (not gonna do this tomorrow, my stomach is a mess). I try not to eat too much, because the cravings following are still terrible. Another technique I have is to actually micmic smoking. I just inhale and exhale like I would with a cigarette. Exhaling smoke is my favourite part of smoking, that's what I miss the most. So, surprisingly, this little gesture is somehow a relief.

So far I can't exercise as I wished I would because I'm so light-headed. As I can't think straight I tend not to plan anything that needs my complete attention. So I've been pretty bored all day.

I am now H+22, in bed. Cravings are still hard. Dizziness. Still feeling stupid.
But all of it is manageable so far. I know the cravings only last for a short while, so I wait them out. I try to keep in mind that this is all hard, but temporary, and so worth it. And that I do NOT want to go through this again (and that was only my first day).

But anyways, I feel so proud ! I am definitely motivated to keep on.
And writing helps ! This is kind of a game, a case study. I have to keep going to see what's going to happen next.

**TL;DR** :

I've been smoking for 9 years, 1 pack a day for almost 3 years. First attempt, first day ! Symptoms were (in order): lightheadedness, dizziness, inappropriate emotional responses to common events (anger and uncontrollable sobbing for NO reason), incapacity to focus, to think straight, thus feeling very intellectually diminished (loss of words, loss of short term memory, stuttering, feeling lost...), violent and frequent cravings, especially after eating. All of the symptoms softened by H+15. A little rise before going to bed. So far, it is quite hard, extremely uncomfortable, but manageable. And worth fighting for.

Smokeless Tobacco - I want to quit.

I've been dipping since high school (about 6 years) and I think I've decided its time to quit. I'm a college student so it's hard to scrape up upwards from $20 a week to buy nicotine lozenges or gum, but it's really easy to come up with $5 dollars to buy a can when the nicotine fits hit. Anyone know of any good resources for students to get free or discounted nicotine lozenges or gum (preferably free). I'm in Texas if that helps, thanks everybody!

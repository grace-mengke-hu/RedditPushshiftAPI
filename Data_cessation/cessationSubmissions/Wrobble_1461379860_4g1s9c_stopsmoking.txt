Last smoke, I am done!

Hey guys,


So a little backstory. I am 28 years old, I have been married to my wife for 6 years coming up, have a 6 year old son, and a 2 day old daughter. I smoked throughout High school, but ended up stopping when I graduated. Got my Welding ticket after working in landscaping and carpentry. Met someone who ended up being one of the coolest guys I know named Clark. After we graduate 1st and 2nd in the class, I already have a job lined up and I get him a job. Within the first week he ended up talking to another co-worker and jumped ship to another company. The last day I seen him was on Friday, and he past away on the following Tuesday due to a work place incident. That is where my smoking restarted. Combining the stress of being the lead hand/foreman and Clark's death weighing heavily on my mind, I started smoking anywhere from a pack a day, to 2 packs a day. That was 4 years ago.


My daughter was born this Wednesday, with the middle name Clarke, and I have had 6 smokes since then. The first 3 were your normal, this is great feeling. The other 3 were guilt ridden and a heavy nauseous feeling. Hopefully when I get to work on Monday I don't fall back into it.


Wish me luck :)

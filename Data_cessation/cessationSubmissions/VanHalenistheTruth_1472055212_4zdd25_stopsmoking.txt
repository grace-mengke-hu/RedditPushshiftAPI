Starting the patch and gum today. Any experiences about those two anyone can share with me?

I did three.  Smoked, snus and e-cigarette.  Smoked for almost ten years, snus for four and e-cigarette off and on for two years.  I do want to quit but the main motivation is the wife and kids.  My wife hates it and I've lied and hid for months now (she knew, she just didn't want to play detective for) but she straight up caught me and the argument ensued and everything came to a head.  Stop or our marriage is going down the tubes.  Sigh.  

So anyways, patch and gum.  Also on lexopro and abilify since April for my other issues.  It all feels very overwhelming.  A wife, a five year old and a rambunctious two year old, 35 years old and halfway through college (which starts today).  Only taking two classes a semester because we both work full time and a full load would be impossible.  Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, not to mention the bouts with depression over the years.  I know it is possible to do all this and come out the other side a better person.  Any tips (about anything) would be helpful.

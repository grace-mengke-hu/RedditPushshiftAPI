I drove to school today

and I didn't even *think* about having a cigarette! Granted, it was about 6:30am and I was pretty tired, but it's usually a reflex. The second I start my car and put on my seatbelt I light up a cigarette.

I was only about a half a pack a day smoker for about 5 years, but it's only been 3 days and this was encouraging.  It only hit me when I walked onto campus that I hadn't even thought about having one until that moment.  I still get cravings pretty bad after eating, and I'm sure drinking is going to suck, but I'm well on my way and I'm not looking back.

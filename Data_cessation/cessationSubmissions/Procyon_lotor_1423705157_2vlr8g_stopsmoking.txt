Decided to smoke my last cigarette today. What can i expect, and how do I deal?

I smoked anywhere from 2-12 cigarettes a day for about the past year. I'm only 18 and I don't even enjoy it (gives me headaches and hurts my throat), I know it's bad for me, and im starting to become healthier by exercising (to help with my depression) so i'm done. 

Anyway, I wanted to ask, what should i expect in the coming weeks? From what withdrawal symptoms will i suffer? How can I resist the urge to smoke socially and not smoke when my friends do?

Anyway, thanks!

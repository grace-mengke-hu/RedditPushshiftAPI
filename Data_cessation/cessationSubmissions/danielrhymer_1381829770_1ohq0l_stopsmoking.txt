First time quitting

Alright, well I'm almost 20, been smoking since I was about 15. I've always smoked about two packs per week and can't sleep tonight due to thinking about it. I'm with a girl I really like and want to be with for a long time. Although she doesn't have problems with me smoking, I suddenly want to be with her as long as I can. My plan thus far is to quit absolutely cold turkey. I've always been afraid to quit because I've been afraid to admit that I can fail at it. Any advice / support would be extremely welcome.

How can I make it easier to quit when my entire family smokes constantly and indoors?

Hello, I've decided today to quit smoking. It's giving me so much anxiety thinking it's cancer when anything goes wrong with my body. Recently got diagnosed with GERD which smoking is a huge trigger for. So I'm quitting. 

I don't live with my parents, and they're separated, but they both smoke indoors. My dad and his girlfriend are the worst for it! They both chainsmoke inside and it's so hard not to light one up with them everytime I go visit. I feel this will be the biggest hurdle to get over.

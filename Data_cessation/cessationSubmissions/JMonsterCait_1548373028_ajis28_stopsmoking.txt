Didn’t want to quit

I didn’t want to quit smoking. I loved it. It soothes me. I took my dog outside with my morning coffee and lit up and woke up. Took a cup of tea out at night with the dog before bed. I had comfort, I had routine, l had me time. 

I lost my job this week and with that I lost the ability to spend money on anything but what is absolutely necessary to survive. While I currently feel a cigarette is mandatory for my mental health, I know that’s not true and soon enough it will pass- but for all that is good and holy- the cravings are enough to make me weep.  

I’m 24 hours in, cold turkey. I wonder how things will be in a week, a month, a year?

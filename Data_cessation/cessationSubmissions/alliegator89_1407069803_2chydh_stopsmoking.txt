So hard to wake up

Every since quitting I have had SOOOOO much trouble getting out of bed. My bed feels more comfortable than it used to and I don't have the morning cigarette to smoke. I hope getting out of bed gets easier soon! I liked the morning person I had become. Not worth going back to smoking to being a morning person but I'd like to be able to pop out of bed and feel fully awake.

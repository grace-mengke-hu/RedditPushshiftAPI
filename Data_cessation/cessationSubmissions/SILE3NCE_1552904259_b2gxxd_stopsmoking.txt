Weird Quitting

Hi guys, I came here just cause I really wanted to share this piece of information, and see if it happened to other people as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I went out, and got drunk, like really wasted. It's not usual, it's just that one night of the year where I spend the next day vomiting every hour until my stomach forgives me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27, I've done this before, nothing new. 

&amp;#x200B;

Funny part is, I smoke for 12 years (yes, since 15) and since that day I literally can't smoke. It tastes awfully and it reminds me of all that alcohol I consumed causing nausea almost instantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone had the same?  


Note: I also can't eat junk food like candy and chocolat.   
Note 2: I developed a weird love for apples and tea.

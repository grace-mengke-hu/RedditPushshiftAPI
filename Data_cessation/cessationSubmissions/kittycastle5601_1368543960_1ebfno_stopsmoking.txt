e-cigarettes? What do we think?

So I have been smoking for about 3-4 years now, quit once for about 6 months and then started again. Last time I quit I went cold turkey and managed pretty well, however I had migraine headaches everyday around the same time that lasted for HOURS and made me VERY grouchy--they were terrible. I think that is one of my biggest fears about quitting again is having to deal with those terrible headaches, especially now that I am working 14 hour days between two jobs. My boyfriend is quitting as well but he has been going the e-cigarette route... I am concerned that I can quit smoking cigarettes however if I go to the e-cigarette I will become just as addicted to that pen as I was to the physical cigarette, but I think it would help with the headaches.. What are your thoughts on this friends? I have been slowly cutting back the past couple days on the amount of cigarettes I have been smoking in an effort to wean off and maybe not have such terrible nicotine withdraws.. any advice would be helpful!

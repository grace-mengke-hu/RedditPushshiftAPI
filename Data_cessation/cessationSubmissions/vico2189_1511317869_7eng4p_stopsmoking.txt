Thinking about relapsing

Almost 3 weeks cold turkey, but today is a hard day.

I'm having personal issues, my relationship with my gf is not going well, and I think a cigaret would make all of this more acceptable. I don't even know anymore why I decided to give up this support in my life. 

I know I'm saying stupid shits right now, but my life would be so much easier/enjoyable if I had a smoke right now.

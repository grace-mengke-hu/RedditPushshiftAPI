Last time quitting hookah, ever.

I know this isn't talked about as much, but I've been addicted to nicotine in a different form than most: shisha / hookah. I discovered it when a roommate brought one out at the first place I moved into for college 9 years ago. I liked it, I thought it was cool, and even though it was smoking, I bought into the "water filters things" argument and thought "this can't be as bad, right?"

Fast forward through some really crazy life events, and I've found its appeal disappearing, but I couldn't put it down. I've tried to quit numerous times, even getting a vape, but always found myself back at the hookah lounge or over at a friend's place smoking. The hard thing was / is that all my friends like it too. 

I've wanted to quit for the money, the health, the fact that it literally feels like its holding me down and holding me back from what I want in life. 

Well, to be transparent, smoking IS holding me back from having what I want in life, as I'll be undergoing the transition from male to female, and the mix of nicotine + artificial estrogen is a recipe for instant death via blood clots. 

That's been the case, but it's still been hard. You all have helped me, especially with all the resources and relatable life experiences. Now I've reached a point of peace, especially after watching and reading Allen Carr's advice over and over. I've put it down and I have no desire to go back. 

Thanks all.

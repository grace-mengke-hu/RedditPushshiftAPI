New site for people in AZ looking to quit

Hey guys, I've been so inspired by the stories I've read here. My mom started smoking when she was 17. She smoked a pack a day for as long as I could remember but last year, after 40 years of smoking, she quit! I hope that soon, my sister (smoker since 14, now 25) will follow in her footsteps.

I wanted to share this resource with you guys. It's meant for people in AZ, but could be used everywhere. I hope some of you find it helpful: http://projectquitaz.com

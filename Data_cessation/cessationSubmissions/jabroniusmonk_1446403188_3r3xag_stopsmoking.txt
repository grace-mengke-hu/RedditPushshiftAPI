Starting to worry that these feelings will be permanent.

Like most everyone on this sub who has/is trying to quit, I have had a rollercoaster couple of weeks as I finally try to get nicotine out of my life.  

I have been lucky to not really have very many cravings.  I think that once I got it into my head that I was done, I was done.  It became a waiting game to just get through a certain amount of time to regain some pleasure/comfort in my life. 

The withdrawal symptoms that I find myself still having are some anxieties (though not as bad as the first two weeks), decreased appetite, feeling a slight sense of doom/gloom, feeling down, feeling out of it.  Sleep is still a bit disturbed.

I will be at 18 days completed tonight and I am just starting to get worried that this might be my new normal. If it is, I will probably be able to deal with it.  I've heard that most of the changes happen before 3 weeks but I was just wondering if any of the quitters here have experienced big changes during these 3rd and 4th weeks?  Can anyone explain if what I am going through is normal or will resolve itself?

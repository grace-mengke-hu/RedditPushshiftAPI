Survived Day 1, over half way done with Day 2

So, day one surprised me. I felt alright, now I'll admit I smoked a small joint of pure weed in the morning which kicked my cravings for most of the day and I felt unusually blissful. Had a busy day that managed to occupy my time and celebrated with some thai food. 

However, today is a whole other story. God damn if I'm not a rollercoaster today. I feel delirious one moment with breaks of calm occasionally and then bursts of tears the next. I've spent most of the day in bed staring at my phone like a mad woman. Now my brain has managed to block out the thought of smoking a cigarette, I consider it not an option, but I cant hardly think at all for the most part - like my brain is all clouded up. 

Prepared for tomorrow and whatevers to come. I'm so glad I timed this while I wasnt at work. I dont think I would have made it otherwise.

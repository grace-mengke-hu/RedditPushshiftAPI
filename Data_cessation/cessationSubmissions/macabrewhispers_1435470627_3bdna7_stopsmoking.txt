Looking to stop smoking

I came to the decision that hopefully Monday will be the day I stop smoking. But honestly, I'm fucking scared!

I'm 21, and have been a pack a day smoker since I was 12. 
This will be my first attempt at quitting. 

I decided I'm going to quit for health reasons. I've noticed that my usual 7 min miles, have now turned into 20 min. 
That and my mother who was a smoker for 50 years has some major medical problems from smoking.

Any tips, advice, or pointers that will help me out?

Thank you :)

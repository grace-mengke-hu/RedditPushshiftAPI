Hehehe...little early gift to myself for my 2nd month anniversary.

I have been enjoying doing some treadmill work more and more. I am slowly progressing to running, from walking. My legs are getting conditioned, which is nice. 

So...

I got my self some sweet ass Puma running shoes as a gift. damn right! That's how we do it! 

I am going to be fucking styling like a mofo at the gym and I can't wait. I am so excited.. I can barely hide it! I am about to lose control and I think I like it! 

That is all..

I made it to day 13 but literally almost failed. Twice.

Hey all! Almost two weeks down. I had to share this story with you all. Friday was on and off just the weirdest, and hardest day of my quit so far. No matter what I did, I kept thinking about smoking. Nothing was really stressing me out, it was just a really tough day. I almost bought cigs TWICE, got to the gas station and everything, but eventually cursed myself out and drove away. I did not smoke. 

I will say, I have been using the patches. They’ve been fine, but yesterday I switched from the patch and pulled out a vape with less nicotine than the patch. I know this isn’t smoking and it’s another form of NRT... but I managed to escape my hardest craving and almost messed it up. I feel good about that, but I definitely didn’t want to go the Vaping route. I suppose that’s better than relapsing right?

I love reading all your success stories and determination even if you messed up. Can we have a thread where we encourage each other and remind ourselves of the reasons we're quitting?

For me it's mostly to do with my girlfriend and my determination to be a loving father. I don't have kids and don't plan to for ages but I really long to give that kid the best role model possible and I can't do that if I kill myself every day. I'm only 8 days in but I feel great, even if I am depending on my vape a bit much to get me through

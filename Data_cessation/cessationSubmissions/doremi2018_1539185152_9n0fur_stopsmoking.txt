A different perspective

Maybe being totally smoke-free, counting how many days won't work for everyone. 

I decided to quit smoking, generally not smoking (so I now consider myself a non-smoker I mean I no longer purposely buy cigs, or I don't need to smoke everyday all the time) but sometimes I smoke socially (or cheat) on occassion one or two sticks. 

For me maybe it's better to think of it that way than to be hard on myself for breaking my no smoking streak. 

You thoughts?

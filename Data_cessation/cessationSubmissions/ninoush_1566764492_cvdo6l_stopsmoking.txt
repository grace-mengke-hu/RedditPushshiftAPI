Experienced a very bad anxiety crisis tonight, is this related to quitting?

Tonight is the first night since I quit where I really crave a cig. 
I experienced an anxiety crisis for about one hour, and felt at that time that a cig would have helped. 

I used to have anxiety crisis about 4 years ago, but did not happened since. This is my first one since, and it's happening one month after I quit. 

Do you have similar experiences ? Also do you think this is related to quitting?

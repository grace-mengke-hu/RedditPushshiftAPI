19 glorious smoke free days

I don't miss cigarettes. I don't miss feeling lethargic. I don't miss the tingles in my body. I don't miss the rush. I don't miss the smell... or having to make time for a cigarette. I don't miss having to worry if I have enough money to get me through the week. I am regaining my health, myself and my power. I am strong. I am a non smoker. I am me. I am who I was 3 years ago (well, slowly getting there.) I have urges to be active instead of killing myself.

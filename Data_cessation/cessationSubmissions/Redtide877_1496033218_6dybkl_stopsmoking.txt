Why do i still have strong cravings +6 months

I dont get it. I have had since i quit in early December about 2 cigs. Was a marb red pack a day smoker. I still get every once and a while super strong craving. Like i walk into the house the other day and it was like OMG turn around and light up. I still get so many cravings. So idk. I miss smoking i dont see any benefits besides coughing less nothing much has changed.

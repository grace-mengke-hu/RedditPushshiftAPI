Have you ever been in an unhealthy relationship?

Have you ever dated someone who everyone told you was horrible for you? Who none of your family or friends approved of? And once the relationship ended, you realized how silly you were to have ever been involved with that person in the first place? That is the relationship between you and a cigarette. The absolute only way to see it for yourself, is to get out of it first. It's been 26 days, and I am free. I hope you all are on your way there too.

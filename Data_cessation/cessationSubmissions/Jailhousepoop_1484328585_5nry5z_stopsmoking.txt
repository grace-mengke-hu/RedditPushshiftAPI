How do you guys deal with cravings?

This is the first time that I post on here and the third time that I'm trying to stop. I stopped about a week ago because because it eats up my money and it makes me stink and overall it's just a bad habit. 

I'm literally shaking while I type this. How do you guys deal with those cravings and when will it stop?

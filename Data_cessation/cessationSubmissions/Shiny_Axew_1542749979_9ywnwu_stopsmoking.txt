Any tips for making my 62 year old dad stop smoking?

So my dad smokes quite a lot, never got to count how many cigarates he smokes a day, but I think it’s about 20 a day. He has been smoking for over 40 years. I can see the signs of smoking on him: coughing, cold hands, yellow-ish teeth/skin and he easily loses his breath. My family and I would love to make him stop, but despise many attemps he still smokes. He says he’d rather die a few years early and happily than a few years later and miserable.

Could any of you help me in some way?

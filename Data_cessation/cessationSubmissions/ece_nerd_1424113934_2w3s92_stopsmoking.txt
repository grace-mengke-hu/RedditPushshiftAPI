Getting my Health Insurance...

I am a 23yo male and smoked/dipped for the better part of the last 6 years. 

My dad is turning 65 this year and switching over to Medicare. 

I have to get my own health insurance now and will likely be tested for nicotine.

Now, I know cigarettes can be expensive, but insurance premiums are way worse.

**TL;DR** I'm quit for a month and a half :)

P.S. Started small home workout routines every time I get bored before I even think about having a craving. So helpful.

P.P.S. Sub-zero weather makes it a little easier also.

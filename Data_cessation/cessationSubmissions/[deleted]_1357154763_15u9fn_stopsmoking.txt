2 Months in and I feel great! 

For everyone that just started this voyage, hang in there! I know it might hurt right now, and its definitely far from easy, but quitting is beneficial in numerous ways and your brain is just lying to you when you get cravings. 

One thing that helped me a lot was this subreddit. Getting on and reading others success stories helps me every day, and giving the occasional motivation to others here has its own rewards as well. 

Oh, don't touch any tobacco. None. The "One every once in a while" tactic will never work. You need to treat your cravings the same way you set rules for your kids... no exceptions.

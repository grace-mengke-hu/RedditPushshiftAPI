Quit a year ago, picked up smoking for 3 weeks before putting it down: Interesting observations as to the sludge buildup and how fast your body goes back to shit!

I figured I would share this with others. I quit a year ago and just started smoking a pack or two a week for about 3 weeks total.

Put it down about a month ago and my god, in such a short time, my smoker's flu came back and I am coughing up huge balls of hard green and yellow phlegm in the mornings when I wake up STILL! 

Impressive to say the least such a short amount of time smoking sludged up my lungs so fast!

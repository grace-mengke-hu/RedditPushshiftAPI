148 days, going strong.

It seems like an age ago since I last smoked a cigarette. The sense of accomplishment is wonderful.

I managed to do something I never thought I could - I watched a series that had characters smoking like chimneys without feeling that need for one. It was Stranger Things, if you're wondering. It's fantastic, and I'm glad I could actually relax and enjoy it without feeling like I wanted a cigarette.

A good friend of mine still smokes, and the smell of cigarettes are horrible to me now. Gets a little bit annoying when he sits down beside me reeking of it, but it doesn't make me want a ciggie.

I remember thinking that I could never do this. I have an addictive personality which I used as an excuse to never quit. I'm glad I've proved myself wrong.

Much love to this sub, and I hope you're all having a good day/evening.

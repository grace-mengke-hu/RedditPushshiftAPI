Day 12. Today... I really wanted to smoke.

I just wanted to all day, more than any other day so far. I felt like okay you quit smoking again, but now it’s time to go back to smoking.

I don’t ever want to smoke again, and that’s what getting me through this. I don’t ever have to quit again and deal with the side effects I’ve had.

I have my patch on and ran out of gum so I’m chewing some Big Red which is actually really helpful.

Day 12 is almost over... I’m ready for day 13!

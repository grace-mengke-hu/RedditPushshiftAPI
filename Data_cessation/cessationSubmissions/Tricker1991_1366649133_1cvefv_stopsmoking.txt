Need advice for fiancé.

Hi all, my fiancé has been a smoker for about ten years now (started at 14) and I've attempted to get her to quit, I even purchased one of those electronic cigarettes to at least try to get her to ween off them. But she completely refuses. We are to the point where she buys a pack every two days (and I'm sure she is pulling money from emergency funds and food budget for extra packs). And they aren't cheap up here. $9 a pack. She is to a point where cigarettes have become more important than food on the table for our family. She stresses about finances all the time but we live fine on one income, especially if she cut out smoking. I am currently unemployed an we have two kids. So in order to for me to hold a job I have to make over $15 an hour otherwise I will be putting the money into daycare and her smoking habit and thats it. I would rather be with the kids. I am currently looking for a job but I'm not taking one to get nowhere. Everytime I bring up smoking I get shot down and yelled at like it's my fault. Is there any advice you can give me?

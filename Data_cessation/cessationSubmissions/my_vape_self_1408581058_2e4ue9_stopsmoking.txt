You get to be cranky. I get to be cranky. I Quit Too.

Edit:

Redacted this post.

Sorry, I didn't mean to worry anyone.  A combination of posts I had read and private messages I received left me in the place where I was frustrated.  I thought, and still think, we could do better by the people that come by here.  I've said all that elsewhere, and I'll keep trying to make it better myself.

I shall ignore the negative energy.  I shall bring more positive energy.  I shall be grateful for all the people who put some time in here.

Thanks.

Slowly but surely convincing my mom to stop smoking and improve her health

I (21,Male) want my mom (52) to quit smoking for the rest of her life. I'm in to fitness and i did manage to have her do some as well, but she always hooked off after a couple of weeks. 

She used to work like crazy until 48. but then started working part time, and due to the reducing of the stress at work she gained pretty much weight over the years. She tries to ignore it, but i can see that deep inside she doesn't feel very well in her own body. She still has the habit of smoking for counteracting the stress she had when she worked hard, but now she doesn't have so much stress anymore and the smoking is still a habit.

She smokes at least a cigarette every hour, sometimes 2 depending on how stressed she feels.

If she can stop smoking, she sure as hell will prove that she can do ANYTHING with her own commitment...

It's very much a taboo though that i start talking about her smoking being a problem. Whenever i work out in the garage gym and she comes in, lights a cigarette and stands there for a minute, i politely ask her to smoke somewhere else because i get a headache from the smell, and it doesn't quite make sense to work out while you're inhaling smoke. She gets mad at me for asking that. I don't think she really gets mad at me, more for how the situation makes her feel about herself.

I love my mom and want her to enjoy herself for the rest of her life. Tomorrow she will turn 53, i was thinking that this might be the right moment to finally change something, but then again she might get mad and it'll ruin her day.

tl;dr:
I'm asking you guys which way of approaching this problem might be more on the win-win side. So i want her to quit smoking, but i also want her to enjoy herself in the process of quitting, making her feel good about doing so.

1 month and so many changes!

First of all, I gotta say, my english is really bad. I'm trying my best here to share my story. 

A year ago I broke my 4 years streaks of cigarette free. For whatever reasons I resume smoking, 2 weeks ago I quit again for the second time. I'm a bit of a spiritual guy and I always told myself that when i'm going to stopsmoking, great things gonna happen to me. Since I quit so many great things happen to me that I gotta share with reddit community.

1- I got my sex life back on track (was going threw a small depression and I guess that smoking was not helping...)! 
2- I never had so many girls that wanted to date me, it's unbelievable. I even met someone that can turn to be a potential serious relation (short story: I got out of a 8 years relationship 10 monts ago)
3- I had a substential raise at my job. I guess i'm more productive then ever (fuck those cigarette breaks)
4- I found a dream appartement to live in. Smoke free :) Moving in next week. 
5- I do alot of training, and I can finally see tangible progression towards my cardio (yup I know, it's they obvious one...)

Anyway, I just wanted to share a little bit of my story here. Maybe I't can help someone that is going threw some urge to have a quick one...

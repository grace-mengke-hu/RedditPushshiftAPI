Do i count it

Hey guys so ive been quit almost 6 months and it feels great i have no urges or anything normally.

I went to a gig and i got a bit drunk, my mate offered me a social smoke.

I had one drag and the taste was awfull and i gave it back.

Do i count that as all these days over. I havent touched one since and it was a week ago i had one drag and i don't plan on having one again it truely was vile.

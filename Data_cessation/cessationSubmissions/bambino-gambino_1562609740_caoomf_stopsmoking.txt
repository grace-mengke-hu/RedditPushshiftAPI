I used to be a secret smoker and I hated it.

I was smoking, let’s say, 1-4 cigarettes a day for about 3 years. In the beginning I was more open about it. I was kind of embarrassed, but that soon turned into full on shame.

This past year I started smoking only in secret. I would find a bench far enough away from my work building downtown where I knew I wouldn’t see any of my coworkers. I would only smoke while driving or when totally away from my apartment. I found myself making up excuses to go run an errand just so that I could smoke.

About two months ago I bought a vape, and I finally don’t feel trapped. No more made up errands. No more looking over my shoulder. No more gum, and hand sanitizer, and perfume. 

My goal now is to completely cut out nicotine, but I am so grateful to be freed from cigarettes. I hated everything about it.

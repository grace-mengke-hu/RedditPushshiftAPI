Can you be in withdrawal while using patches?

Hi guys, 

I'm on day 3 today of not smoking. 

I'm using 2 24hour patches a day (doc approved) and vaping. 

Is it even possible for me to still be in withdrawal?

I used to smoke every 20minutes / 30 a day.

Having horrible moodswings, cravings and panic attacks. 

I can't figure out if I'm in withdrawal or have overdosed on nicotine as the symptoms are really similar!
Thanks

Edit: Ok so today still feel awful, can't think straight - decided to take one patch off and see if I felt any better = how long until that other patch is 'gone' out of my system? And will my withdrawal get worse now? (I have an assignment due in at 11.55pm tonight!!!)

Need Help

I have been smoking for about 4 years - started with 16 now trying to quit with 20 - stopped at about ~12 a day.
I must say it´s beeing harder than expected especially when I am currently preparing for exams in the university. 

I should have been clean since 29 days but I relapsed 2x times already. Once on New Years Eve - 1x zig and last week when I was desperately struggling to get a project done. I thought it would help and it kind of did - I sorted my thoughts and worked 5 hours in a row and finished my project. But neverthless it made me feel like a looser.


I am obviously feel much healthier and my stamina is getting better and better + I started going to the gym from 2 times a week to 5-6 times a week!
But i can´t help to feel like shit for relapsing and I am constantly irritable for the past 2 weeks. I don´t know what will happen when the exams start. It´s getting really hard because everyone notices how stressed I am all times.
Please I need some advice on how to calm my mind and how to deal with these relapses...

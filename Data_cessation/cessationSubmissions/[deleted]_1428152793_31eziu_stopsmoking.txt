Back on the Wagon

I went almost a year and a half without smoking. (Though I was on nicotine patches for the majority of the time)

My job is pretty stressful and it's been particularly stressful lately, not to mention there has been some bs at home as well.

As you've probably guessed, I broke down and smoked. I only had one or two and tossed the pack.

I did that 4 times this week.

Yesterday I bought a pack because it was Friday and smoked the whole damn thing.

Now my mouth feels like an ashtray and I feel depressed.

I'm getting back on the wagon today....but the fact that it will take a year and a half to get back where I was feels daunting.

Also, I'd like to clarify for those on the first few days of your quit that the withdraws only last for a few days/2 weeks at most. 

In my case I decided to smoke one or two after a year and a half thinking I was immune to the clutches of nicotine addiction. I stand corrected.

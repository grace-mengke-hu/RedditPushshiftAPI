I'm so optimistic about quitting this time it's almost nauseating!

I'm not sure how you all feel about Chantix but I call my states quitline service and after discussing the options I decided to try it. I've tried nicotine replacement and I finally came to the conclusion that I need to kick nicotine completely. So..8 days ago I got my Chantix and started taking it. 

Today is day 8. The day I would have dreaded a week ago. The day I HAVE to give up cigarettes. I woke up this morning and a cigarette wasn't the first thing I thought about. I'm not dreading this at all. I think about a cigarette and it passes...like most thoughts. I don't obsess. I have no weird side effects from the meds like I was worried about. I have a straw I cut to cigarette length to help with the oral fixation but I'm not even using that. I just feel ready and proud and GOOD. I am SO glad I gave that little pill a try. This is by far the easiest time I've had trying to quit. I cannot WAIT to have that extra money too! 

If you're hesitant about Chantix I understand. I was too. Talk to a doctor though and consider it. It really has made this incredibly easy for me.

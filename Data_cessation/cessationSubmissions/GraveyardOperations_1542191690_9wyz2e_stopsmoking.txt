I have been forced to quit

Got oral surgery. To prevent dry socket/abscess, I cannot smoke for 2-3 days.

I didn't want to quit, but I'm being forced to. I want to run into traffic right now. No nicotine gum, patches don't work, no cigarettes, no vaping, no e-cigs, no anything.

Seriously. Kill me. Someone could pull a knife on me and I would thank them.

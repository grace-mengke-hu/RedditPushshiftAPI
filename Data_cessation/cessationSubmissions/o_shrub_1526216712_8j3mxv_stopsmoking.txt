Just had my first relapse dream...

I was rifling through old boxes and found a half smoked cigarette. Even in the dream I was aware that it had to be over a year old and would taste pretty disgusting, but I was overwhelmed and about to do it when I woke up. No cravings at all now. This happen to anyone else?

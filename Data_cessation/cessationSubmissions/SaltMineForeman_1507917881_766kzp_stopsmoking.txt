Just hit a month

I hit a month smoke free the other day and I'm pretty stoked. Today I thought about just having one... Then I thought about all the people on reddit that would tell me to fuck off if I did smoke again...

Sigh. It's been a stressful week. 

Still smoke free though because smoking won't take away my problems.

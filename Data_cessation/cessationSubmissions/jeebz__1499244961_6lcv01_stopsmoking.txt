I'm having a terrible week.

Almost 3 months now smoke free. Haven't touched a cig and toned down the vape too. 

This week has been horrid. I'm having problems at home. I'm struggling badly with a break up and work is giving me a lot of stress. This morning I woke up completely miserable and I've been craving a cigarette since. It's taking every fibre of self control to not go and buy a packet but I'm dangerously close to doing so. I don't want to fail but I don't know if I can carry on without. 

Help

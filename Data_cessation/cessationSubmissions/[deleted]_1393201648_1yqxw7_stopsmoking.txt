My main question, what to do with your time?

So, I recently quit, and I dont have cravings and I don't miss smoking really. Except, it gave me something to do and I used it to help keep me calm. So now, I feel like I have a huge amount of time thrown into my life and I don't know what to do with it. I have hobbies already and I've tried finding a new one, but I've tried most things already. On top of that since I no longer keep calm through smoking, I have a lot of nervous/excited energy that I don't have anything to do with.

Has anyone had a similar experience? What did you do?

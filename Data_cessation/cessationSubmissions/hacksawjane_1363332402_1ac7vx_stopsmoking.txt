98 days smoke free, quit early December and I have been sick since New years.

Beginning of January it started off with a mild cold with a sore throat, that slowly got better and never progressed into anything. I had a week without symptoms, then had two ear infections and full blown strep throat after that week. I finally start to feel better around the end of February, and then again this past week I get strep throat-- *again.*

is anyone else going through any kind of chronic bronchitis/pharyngitis? is this even NORMAL? While I did have bronchitis a few times last year, I never had it almost back to back when I was a smoker.

**inb4** go to a doctor; I have no health insurance and I already owe urgent care up the butt in medical bills. Not looking for advice on how to treat the condition, looking for an explanation as to why I could be getting sick so often-- assuming my non smoking COULD be the cause?

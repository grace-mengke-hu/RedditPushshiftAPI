The strange side of addiction.

Now that I've quit smoking for 2 weeks over, sometimes I want to smoke because I remember feeling empowered by smoking. Or as silly as it sounds, I felt cooler and confident. For me, to part with cigarettes gave me this vague fear that, I am no longer who I used to be when smoking.
Am I alone in this? Anyone else want to share strange reasons that they suddenly are having cravings?

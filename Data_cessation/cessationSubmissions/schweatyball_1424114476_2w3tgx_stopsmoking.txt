6 weeks, over 1000 hours smoke free, $230 saved and 455 cigarettes not smoked!

I'm 28 and have been a heavy smoker for about 12 years. I've tried quitting multiple times and multiple ways. Just posting this to all those out there struggling to quit. Quitting is one of the hardest things to do - but the benefits completely outweigh the costs. I wish everyone on this sub the best of luck, and we've all already crossed the first major milestone and this is WANTING to quit!

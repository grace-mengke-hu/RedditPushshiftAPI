I'm nervous...

So I'm on day 16. Pleased with my progress so far. This subreddit really helps. If I have a craving, I'll scroll through and read our struggles and successes, sometimes commenting. 

I'm nervous because after reading and sometimes re-reading some of the posts, I've noticed some of us pick up the habit again after a few weeks, a few months, even a few years! How can this happen? How do you let this happen? Even after a couple years, are the cravings so strong you feel like you need it? Can we discuss this please? I need to know what to expect and ultimately avoid. It's only been a short time for me, but I never want to go back again.

18 days gone

I broke down and just had two cigarettes. I feel like shit. I pushed away the one support system I actually cared about and I felt so empty and lost so I had to have one. This just proves that I quit smoking for other reasons than wanting to do it myself. I saw my therapist earlier and he says I have issues I need to work on mainly the fact that I have such hatred for myself which is probably why I continue to smoke because it kills me. Smoking has been my crutch for depression for the past 6 years and when I didn't have it I had to face myself and I just couldn't live with myself. I have some serious thinking to do if I want to quit again.

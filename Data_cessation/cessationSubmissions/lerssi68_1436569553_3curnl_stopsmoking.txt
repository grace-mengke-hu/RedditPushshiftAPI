This will be it

I'm done destroying my lungs. I just woke up unable to breathe, without more thinking I went out for a cigarette and threw up. Feeling even worse now I decided to quit for good. Have had several attempts before but now I'm confident enough that I can do this. Just resetted my badge for the last time. Also my first post here, been lurking since forever tho.

Need help with stimulant cravings

Driving and coffee have always been my biggest triggers for smoking. I'm a week cig-free today and so far it's been fairly easy; driving hasn't been as hard as I thought. Coffee however has made my cravings almost unbearable. Does anyone have any advice for balancing stimulants and cigarettes?

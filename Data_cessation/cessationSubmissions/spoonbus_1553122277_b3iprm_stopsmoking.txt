I'm 17 and trying to quit. But it's so hard.

I tried cigs like, last yearish, started rly getting into it 8 months back. Started off with cigs and then got into vaping. I don't have one but practically everyone at my school does and I mooch off of them. 

I usually smoke when I'm bored, to socialize , ease my anxiety , or just feel good when I'm having a shit day. N those things happen often so I've become somewhat dependant. 

It's spring break and I have no way to mooch off or buy cigs so I've started going around places people smoke and asking anyone I see who has a smoke for one. It's suprisingly worked a lot. 

It's undescribable how much I want to quit but how strongly I just want "just one last puff". It has so many cons. Besides health wise, and appearance wise (I have a fear of growing old), it's also been affecting my relationship. 

My bf (17) hates people who smoke so for our whole relationship I've been hiding it from him which makes me feel so much guilt. 

I've made a bet with myself that I'm not allowed to smoke all of spring break and it's only been a day and I'm already contemplating a plan to get my next dart or nic fix. I'm super new to this whole thing too so idk what to do. Should I keep vaping here n there to settle the cravings?(tbh I vape more than smoke but I still want to stop being dependant on nic) or should I go total cold turkey ? How do I stop these dumb horrible fucking cravings for something so bad. 

I'm sorry if this isn't what I'm supposed to put in this sub but I needed to put my feelings somewhere and I have no one else to talk to.

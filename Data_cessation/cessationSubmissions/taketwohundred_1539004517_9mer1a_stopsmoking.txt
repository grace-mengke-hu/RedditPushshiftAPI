Three digit days! I genuinely didn't think this would happen when I put out (in frustration) a cigarette on that random afternoon in June. I haven't been seeing too many more positive signs lately since my body is getting used to this. But as the weather turns, I really am starting to appreciate not having to go out in the cold just to smoke one. It's nice and warm and cozy indoors.

I used to think that I'd really miss these 5 minute smoke breaks, but I barely think about them anymore.

In case you read through my previous posts, the itchy gums lasted about a week, and I thankfully didn't have to deal with bleeding gums. The irritation happened between days 60 - 70, and went away just as suddenly.

To everyone who's going through quitting and finding it difficult, please keep at it. Our bodies and minds are amazing things, and while each will convince you in various ways that you need a fix of nicotine, they are also capable of getting through really tough situations.

Have a plan, and really work at it. If it's getting hard, post on here. It's a beautiful community, and we all want each other to succeed. Good luck!

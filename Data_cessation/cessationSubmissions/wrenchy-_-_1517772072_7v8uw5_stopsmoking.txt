How to quit smoking in Teen Years?

Well, that's a bit hard for me to explain but i'll try my best. So i've been smoking for around 2-3 years now (since 15, i am now 17) with a quit period in between for about 5 months. I want to quit again but it's a lot harder now. Also since i am not 18 i don't have access to (NRT). Any ideas on where to start and how. I am really worried but also addicted and it's a bit rough

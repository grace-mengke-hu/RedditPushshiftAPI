Day One; Zero Hour

Just smoked my last cigarette and for good! I'm sick of smelling like shit, turning others away, feeling ashamed smoking around my family and it makes non-smoking bars awkward.  I'm ready to be healthy and save money above all! I've made the decision for my health, my wallet and my loved ones and appreciate any and all support during this time!

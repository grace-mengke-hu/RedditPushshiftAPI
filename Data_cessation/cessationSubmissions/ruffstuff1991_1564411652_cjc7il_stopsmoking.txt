Trading in one addiction for another

i quit smoking cigarettes around 3 years ago with the help of vapes. Now, I'm trying to quit the vape but im finding it much harder to drop this habit. The fact that i could vape almost anywhere didn't help either. Anyone else experiencing the same dilemma? I could use some advice for getting rid of nicotine once and for all.

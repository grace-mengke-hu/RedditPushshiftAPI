I didn’t want to make a New Year’s Resolution, but my body is done with cigarettes.

It’s a good problem to have. I just want to stay strong and listen to my body. Smoking has been a symptom of my own unhappiness and I’m done damaging my health. I’m hoping to focus on beating each craving and living in the moment. Wishing you all strength and clearer lungs :) 

Also, wondering what everyone thinks of NRT. Is it just prolonging the withdrawals or can it help? I’ve been using a vape and gum as cravings hit. Thanks everyone :)

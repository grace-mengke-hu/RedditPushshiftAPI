Start of Day 4, or 72+ hrs (hour 84 to be specific) without smoking!

I woke up today on the beginning of my fourth day of not smoking and I didn't even have a urge to smoke immediately. It took me about 45 minutes to realize that I didn't think of a cigarette!  I've also been sleeping really good and waking up without an alarm clock today and yesterday, waking up at 6:00am and 7:00 am respectively.  Although I forgot to turn on my android app to check for sleep apnea, the days before when I turned it on showed a significant reduction in snoring and I do not feel drowsy in the morning.  Yay, I 'm not dying anymore!  I was going to let my self have unlimited nicotine gum today like yesterday, but I feel I just don't have the urges as much as I did yesterday.

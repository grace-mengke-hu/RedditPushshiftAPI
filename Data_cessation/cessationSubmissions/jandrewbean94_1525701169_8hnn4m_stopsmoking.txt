Quitting..again

Hi everyone. Today is 4 days and 1 hour into quitting for like the 100th time or something. This time I’m really into it, a girl I’ve been seeing for a while who’s really special to me finally said something, one part in a  push on both our ends to grow up a bit and take better care of ourselves. Day 5’s goal on the app is to check out this smoke free community, so I’d like to tell a little background about myself. I’m 24 in Richmond Va. everyone in my family smoked at some point. Ive seen family members and friends suffer from lung/other cancers. I knew I shouldn’t have started smoking and I did anyways. I can usually trace when I started to a bad breakup. But really I think it was an effort to look cool, or something. Then I couldn’t stop, I felt out of control a bit. I really kept it private not wanting to be labeled a smoker, but the smell is pretty indistinguishable so everyone knew lol. Well anyways, that’s pretty much me. Let me know your stories, and any advice you have on staying smoke free! I’m happy to be here and hope to be apart of this community!

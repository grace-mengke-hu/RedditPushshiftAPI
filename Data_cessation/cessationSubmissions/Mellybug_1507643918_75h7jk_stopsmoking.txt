New life - smoking not allowed!

Today is my quit day - again. I had tried a couple of times before but it was always so difficult as my fiancé smoked and had no compunctions about keeping me from quitting with excuses and lack of support. Well, I kicked him to the curb (for a plethora of other reasons) and since I was successful for weeks on end with him around I know I can do it permanently without him around! 

I’ve cleaned my house completely, gotten rid of the horrible smell and smoke stains, purchased some new furniture...I know what I’m in for and I know I am going to be very happy after the initial withdrawals.

Here’s to a new life as a non-smoker!

Smoking dream

I have read about this "smoking dream" but I never experienced it until last night.

I mean, in this dream, I bum a cig from a stranger and I smoke it.  Then I saw a friend hanging out and he was smoking.   I asked him where I could buy some cigs around this place and he led me to a bar that sold cigs.  And I bought a pack.  

I swear:  I woke up in the middle of the night and I was 100% convinced that I actually smoked.  And I was pissed!  I got out of bed and could not go back to sleep.  Eventually, I realized it was just a dream.  

I read about others having this 'smoking' dream but this was the first time for me, after 70-some days of not smoking.

I hope this is not going to be a daily occurrence.  It seemed too real and I lost a lot of sleep......

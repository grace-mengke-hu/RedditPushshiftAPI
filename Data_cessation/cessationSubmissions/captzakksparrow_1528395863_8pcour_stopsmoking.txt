Can I honestly do this?

Hey all, first time poster here but I came for help. Maybe I'm psyching myself out but I genuinely don't know if I want to quit and honestly if I can quit... everyone around me (parents, gf, etc.) wants me to quit but nothing seems to work. I've tried cold turkey, wellbutrin, weening off over time, and electric cigarettes but I can't make it more than a day without smoking one. I still thoroughly enjoy smoking but it is just getting so damn expensive that I want to stop, so how is none of this stuff helping? I really feel like I try things that work for other people but still break down and buy a pack...

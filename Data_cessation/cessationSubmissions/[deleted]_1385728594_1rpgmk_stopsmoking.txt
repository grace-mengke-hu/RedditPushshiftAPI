Almost at 3 weeks. Wanted to share what happened to my body since I quit.

I will be smoke free 3 weeks tomorrow! Yay!!

Ok, so for me, the first few days felt the best. I was motivated, I knew exactly why I wanted to quit, I was disgusted by cigarettes and all that fun stuff. I knew there was nothing that could make me smoke again.

After the first 4 day I started getting cravings. Bad cravings, up to about a few days ago. Cravings that would make me fantasize about how wonderful it would be to light up on my porch or in my car or wherever. But I pushed through them, I knew they were only cravings. They would pass. And they did. 

For the past few days the fantasy of smoking being glamorous has subsided and I'm back to thinking that it's a disgusting habit and I can't believe I ever started. Definitely was depressed/anxious in the beginning. Maybe up to  2 week point. Water helped, eating helped, more eating and water helped. I knew starting this that I would be either depressed or anxious, got both and identified my symptoms. 

Physical Symptoms: Definitely can tell that my breathing has improved. Running is easier. I don't get winded as easy. Started coughing up some phlegm so that's kinda gross but that just means that my lungs are healing. And I had a drink the other day and the thought of having a cigarette didn't even cross my mind.

So 3 week in, feel great. Anxiety and depression has subsided a lot. My biggest worry is going out and being around smokers but I'm taking things one day at a time and I'll deal with it when I get there. 

Thanks everyone!

Edit: teeth are whiter since the whitening toothpaste is actually working this time.

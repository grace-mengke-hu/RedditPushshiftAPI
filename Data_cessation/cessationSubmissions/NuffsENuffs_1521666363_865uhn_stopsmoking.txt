Worried

Its been 105 days since I quit smoking. I still get these headaches,body aches, and fatigue. There was one day that I felt absolutely perfect and I thought all the withdrawal symptoms was over,but that was short lived. I know it takes the body a while to heal itself. But how long. I really long to feel like I did that one day.ğŸ˜ŸğŸ˜ŸğŸ˜ŸğŸ˜Ÿ.

3 days 12 hours 42 minutes into cold turkey secession. It's getting very rough and I need some comfort.

Between anxiety, emotions, and other pains from withdrawal, I have the urge to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes. It is so hard but I just recovered from a moment of weakness. 

My roommates that quit with me have all started back up the habit again. I was slightly hurt that they gave up so quickly. But I also understand that they just weren't ready. They didn't have the will for it yet. 

I am getting so much oxygen, it's drunkening sometimes. The hardest withdrawal symptoms now are related to insulin balance. A cigarette is an instant release button and now the body has to go back to relying on it's own mechanisms. This is leaving me feeling imbalanced and sluggish. My energy level is out of my control right now, on a roller coaster, and I don't know how I feel about that. I read online that it's in my control with sugar, it's just got a 20 minute delay, it's not instant anymore. Overall, it makes the cigarette craving seem longer than the 3 minutes as I researched prior to quitting. Does this sugar and oxygen balance stabilize quickly after quitting?

 I'm seriously committed to quitting. My will power is strong because logic is strong. Without logic, I would not endure this. I know that if I endure the 100 or so episodic cravings I'm going to get better. I am suffering for the short term to fix things in the long term. 

Already I feel better circulated. My hands and feet already have more feeling to them. So do my gums. I am tasting and smelling things a lot better now. It's not always enjoyable to have a better smell sense!!! I could smell the stink on my roommate from a distance earlier. Also remarkable, I bought a subway sandwich and a root beer earlier and the root beer taste was very stimulating; I was in awe.

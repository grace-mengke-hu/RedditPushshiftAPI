In need of some advice

Howdy, folks. Just for some quick background information, nearly a pack a day for the last six or so years.

The hardest hurdle for me to jump was breaking the habit of smoking at work, or during the week at all for that matter. I'm glad to say that I don't now, and I can motor through five days of consistent non-smoking relatively easily.

My problem now is the weekend. As soon as Saturday morning rolls around, I'm out on the front step before I know it. The cravings only really hit me full force on the weekend.

I haven't smoked yet today, I've been clean since April 1st. I've been telling myself that I'd stay clean as my April fool's joke on myself, but I didn't sleep at all last night and my rope is fraying more by the second.

Can anybody help me with ways to distract myself from these weekend cravings? It seems that as soon as I don't have a job to go to, smoking is all I can think about and my heart is liable to jump out of my chest pretty quick here.

Thank you, and best of luck on all your quits! Step by step, one at a time, folks. We can do this.

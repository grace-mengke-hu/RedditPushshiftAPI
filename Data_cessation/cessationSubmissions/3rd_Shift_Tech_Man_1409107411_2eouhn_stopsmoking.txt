Day 1 down.

So, I made it a day.  It was difficult, I'll be honest.  But I made it.  I basically buried myself in my work and tried not to think about it.  The thought did creep in a few times, but I tried to distract myself and that seems to help.

I have a good feeling that this time is the time for me.

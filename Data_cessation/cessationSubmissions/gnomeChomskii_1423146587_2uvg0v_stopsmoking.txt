A few tips from my five months of quitting nicotine

I began by writing a long post about the five months it took me to quit nicotine, but about half way through realized nobody really cares.  Everyone is different anyway, so a lot of the details don't matter for other people - certainly not enough to warrant a play-by-play of the whole ordeal. 

I decided to condense all of it into several truths (for me anyway) and tips.  This is by no means totally inclusive; these are just a few pointers I doubt anyone else is talking about.  And it cost me about a hundred bucks of patches with failed attempts to learn this stuff, so hopefully you won't have to make the same mistakes I did. 

*The generic wal mart or target versions are fine and half the cost.  No, they do not fall off and I couldn't tell the difference between the generics and Nicoderm, which is twice the price. 

*You really do need to use the patches for months.  Don't be a cheapskate!  It will end up costing you more.  I've seen MDs on youtube talking about how two weeks of patching should work.  That wasn't true for me at all.  Physiologically, maybe yes -- but there's more to it than that.  Following the instructions is actually important here.

*If the package says you should start with step 2 based on the amount you smoke, start with step 1 instead.  If you're a really light smoker, go for step 2 instead of 3.  That's the most important tip I've got.  What it means is that for the critical first week when you give up your habit, you are over-nicotined.  This was critically important for me.  If you smoke several packs a day you might need more than just 1 step 1 patch.  (talk to doctor about it, etc etc).  
 
*Yes, you can cut the patches with scissors.  Nothing leaks out, nothing changes.  You just have smaller pieces of the same material.  This comes into play when you start step 3 and realize you're just getting 14 smaller patches (14 days) for the same price.  You can simply cut step 2 patches in half and then have double the number of step 3 patches. 

*Stay on step three for a really long time.  For $13 a month, you can afford to.  I was on step three for two months.

*Sounds wimpy but you can even cut the step 2 patches into QUARTERS and create your very own step 4.  If they are too small to stick on, strap it on there with a bandaid. 

*When you feel ready, take the leap and ditch the patch.  You will probably feel tired and sluggish, like you just woke up from a nap, but it will stay with you all the time.  Drink more coffee.  I took nodoz caffeine pills to counter it.  

My body feels so much better now and I have a sense of accomplishment surround the whole thing.  It's worth it.  Good luck!

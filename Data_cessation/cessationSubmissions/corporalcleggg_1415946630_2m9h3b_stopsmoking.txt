9 Days and Weird Dreams!

So I'm 9 days done, and wow has it been great!! I've been following Allen Carr's instructions and looking at this positively. I had a terrible craving at work this past week and I couldn't believe how right Mr. Carr was when I kept saying to myself "this just means I'm healing, i'm a non-smoker!" And 2 minutes later my mind was back on the job and not on cigs! What a wonderful feeling. 

I also had a peculiar dream last night. I remember taking a deep breath and not feeling any flem or getting choked up and a voice said to me "these are the gifts of healing." Very spiritual, I know haha. It was pretty funny as I'm not religious, but also very motivating. Anyway thanks for reading and keep up the good work to those just starting and those ahead of me! We can do it!

Tips and Tricks?

I'd stopped smoking for about four months, and then picked it up again in the past few days. It's almost like I never stopped. I used to chew gum when walking from place-to-place to help me kick the habit, but it's not working anymore. I do want to be rid of this addiction, and I know will power is a huge part of kicking it for good. Is there any other advice for kicking the habit? I unfortunately can't use the nicotine patches etc as I react to something that's in them.

Messed up last night

I had 10 days, my longest time in a while, and I got cocky. Went out with friends and ended up bumming two cigs over the course of the night, I was pretty drunk. 

Woke up today and my throat felt like hell, just from the two cigs. Back to day one but I'm still confident, still want this more then anything. I just can't let myself let my guard down again.

STRUGGLING.

Y’all. Today has just been one of those stinking days. I’ve been at work since 6am and it’s been ridiculous since I got here. Bought some nicotine lozenges and chewed one and it was terrible. So a few hours later I cut it in half and took it like a pill. I just need to not be here today. Holding strong. Haven’t smoked. But it’s been the hardest thing.

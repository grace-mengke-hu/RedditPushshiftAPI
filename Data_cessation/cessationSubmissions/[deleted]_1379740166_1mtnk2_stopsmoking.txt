Headaches and random pains, anyone else?

I'm coming up on day 6 and started getting some weird intermittent headaches and random body pains like in my fingers and neck... it's not severe, but just strange... Is this some kind of body repairing type thing or withdrawals?  

Anyone else experience the same kind of thing?  

I was clean all last week until this feeling and caved at the bar, feeling instantly better (same headache type feeling) but ultimately ashamed of losing my quit streak.  Reset for the long haul but the side effects are pretty crappy so far.  

Well, other than all of the good breathing, smells, taste and not smelling like an ashtray :)

Edit: Also, the anxiety is through the roof... Is that normal almost a week later?

It's been 3 weeks and I feel like it's the best decision I've made since a long time.

My final year of college was the worst. I got a job before the final year even started and I was prepared to have the best time of my life for the next year. Incessant drinking, smoking and going to innumerable trips. 
I was addicted before I knew it. And to make things worse, I started hooking up with few of my friends. And one of them was insecure since childhood ( which I didn't know about) and didn't approve of me hanging out with anyone else other than her. 
It led to a abusive last four months, were my whole life was literally controlled by her, violent threats to harm herself if I didn't know as she asked. 
I got into Eminem during March. It was the best thing. 
I quit smoking and drinking on april 20, it was 10 years since Em became sober. It was a god send sign. 
The college has ended for a week now. And she is no more a bothering me. 


There is no looking back now. 
Today I even started working out. I felt alive after so many months. 
I was a lurker in this community. But the positivity here is amazing. 
Thank you for everything.

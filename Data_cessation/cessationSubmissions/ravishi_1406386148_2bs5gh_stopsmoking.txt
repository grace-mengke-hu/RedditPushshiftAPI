First week clean

First week clean in two years. Went out three times this week, had some beer, some people smoking around, some friends offering me cigs. Still managed to ignore it and keep the streak.

I can't even complain about the first days. I got sick and the abstinence symptoms were nothing compared to the sickness', so it went pretty smooth. Now I'm OK, going out and building the non-smoking mindset.

Almost 21 and it's time to quit.

I've been smoking for almost 3 years now. Ever since my 18th birthday. My mom bought me step 1 patches (4 weeks worth) and a big pack of non nicotine gum. I'm wondering tho, should I do all 3 steps? My dad quit after using only step 1. I'm worried this won't work though. I'm ready to quit but in scared with my bipolar and anxiety disorders I'll go crazy. I'm not really sure what I'm doing on this subreddit but maybe I just need some advice. Sorry for ranting. Tomorrow is day 1 for me and I'm nervous as hell.

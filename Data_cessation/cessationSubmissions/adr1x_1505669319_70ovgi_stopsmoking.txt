I don't know when I stopped smoking ðŸ¤”

Alright guys. For a long time I was following this subreddit, and I was a smoker. Not sure how hard I was into it but I did 5 cigs a day or soso. And you know what, I had to leave to Germany for a while, and it's been around month I'm there. Thing is, I'm sure I finished my pack here but just realized, I never bought new one. I never had any hard days to go by, nor need to smoke. I guess it's something. I just wanted to share my story, apparently sometimes you can just drop smoking by forgetting... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”so from now on, I think I will keep on this road.

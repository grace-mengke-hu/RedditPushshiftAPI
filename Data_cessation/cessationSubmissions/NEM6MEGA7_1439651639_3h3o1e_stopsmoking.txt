100 Days today - and going strong!

I didn't even notice it was 100 days already. I just checked on the sub, and bam, 100 days flair!

My story is kind of a boring one. I used to smoke since I was a ninth grader, through high school, with various intensity; however, I have never really smoked more than 5-6 cigs a day (except in parties). In my senior year, I started to smoke less and less; right before my final Matura exams, I smoked at a 1 cig/day pace. After finishing my exams, one day, in May, I sat down at home to smoke, as usual. 

However, this time.. It just didn't feel any good. Halfway through the cig I got disgusted and just threw it out. Ever since, I haven't touched cigarettes, I don't even crave them. Sometimes, when I'm drinking, I play with the thought of smoking, but I feel utter disgust (towards smoking) when someone offers me a cig. I tried hookah on a music festival, though - while it was an enjoyable experience, I felt slightly naueseus afterwards, so I'm not really excited to try it again.

What is the moral of my story? The reason I quit smoking was a subliminal one, actually, and it took me quite some time to figure it out. The reason was my GOALS, long term goals to be exact. I decided that I want to live a long and busy life and, while *not* smoking doesn't guarantee  anything, it certainly helps surviving. I want to get a degree or two, have kids one day, and be useful (by my job) for humanity as long as possible. This motivates me more than anything else - and for all these reasons, I will stay strong and never smoke again.

(Sorry if my story didn't make any sense, I'm pretty tired and I typed this without any grammar or meaning check - english is also not my native language. However, it felt good to tell someone my accomplishment; and if I was able to motivate just one person, then it was worth to make this post :) )

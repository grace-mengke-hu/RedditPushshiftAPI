I think it's finally over

I was constantly quitting in the past but now I think I'm finally over it. I've tried toothpicks, mints, nicorette, vapor, gums, sunflower seeds, exercise , etc.  I think taking chantix? ex? Idk how to spell it. It worked. I didnt use the full pack at all and they gave me killer headaches in the beginning but being able to smoke while on it and not feeling the nicotine really helped me realize how gross the taste is. 

I know I'll have to continue to tell myself "no, not even one" but this time around it'll be easier, idk why but I don't even think about it anymore when I get stressed. I'm definitely more stressed than usual considering I don't have a job right now a year out of college but one win at a time and my health comes first. 

I've even stopped counting days.  It has gotten to the point where # of days doesn't matter but that I'll never smoke again. It feels good knowing this. Thanks for being there /r/stopsmoking, you guys and gals are great.

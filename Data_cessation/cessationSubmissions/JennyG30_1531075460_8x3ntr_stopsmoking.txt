32 days quit - swelling in feet and hands?

Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a month since my quit and this community has helped a lot. I smoked for 20 years, more recently after my children about 3-5/day. I had a relatively easy quit and know I will never smoke again. Other than my relatively normal period being about five days late, my most recent “huh, that’s interesting” moment is swelling in my feet and hands. This just started in the last week. Anyone else experience this? For those who have, when did it go away? I need to know there is hope it’ll go away! Thanks in advance!

Stopping smoking after coughing blood

Woke up and started to cough blood, i thought it's nothing kept smoking couch blood in the middle of the day and next morning... I'm 3 days smoke free so far (nothing much but i'm making a big effort since all my friends smoke) 👋🏻 good luck to everyone let's f*** those cancer sticks

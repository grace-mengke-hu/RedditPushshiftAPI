50 days gone...

I had a couple glasses of wine last night and I ruined my 2 month sobriety and my smokefree streak of 50 days. I'm really disappointed in myself but I made the conscious decision to stop before I let things get too out of hand even though everyone around me was in crazy party mode.

Today I'm rededicating myself to my sobriety and to being smokefree!! I'm going to reread Allen Carr and I have reset my counters on my phone... 

I won't smoke with you today!

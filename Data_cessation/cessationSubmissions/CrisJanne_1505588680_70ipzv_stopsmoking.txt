Goals and achievements

I found myself thinking today, as the 4 month goes harshly on me, that we spend so many days, months years wanting to stop that when we finally make it feels like somehow we don't have another big goal. Of course that if we stop to think about it it's easy to understand that this thought is a fraud but that thing that we wanted to do everyday is done and by this 4 month that amazing feeling of achievement is getting more weak (?) Can someone relate?? Stay strong community!

I went to the pub yesterday, sat outside with smokers &amp; didn't smoke on my one week anniversary.

I'm pretty proud of this. I'm not gonna say i wasn't horribly tempted at times (the old "what difference will one make" thoughts kept popping up), but if i can do that for my one week quit anniversary I feel like i should have this in the bag...

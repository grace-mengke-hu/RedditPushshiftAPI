Have been stuck in relapse loops for two years, no more!

Hi there, day two of hopefully the last quit. Quit 8 years ago when I was pregnant, had no problems staying away from cigarettes for 4 years, then very slowly relapsed - within 2 years from 'an occasional party cigarette' back to half a pack daily. Quit several times, usually lasted about 3 months, then relapsed.

And I'm sooo tired of it. No more lame excuses, no more party smokes that'll always always lead back to full blown addiction. And good luck to everyone else quitting 2017!

Still really want to smoke almost ten months in....

I had my last cigarette December 31, 2015. I used Champix and read the Easy Way. I haven't had even a drag or any nicotine all year, but I still want to smoke so bad. I crave it multiple times a day, certainly less frequently and powerfully than in the beginning. I walk down the street and I envy smokers, I definitely still romanticize it, and I love the smell of smoke. I'm not sure if I got older (27 now) and I became more habituated to smoking (I smoked from when I was 16).

I had one previous quit attempt where I went over a year when I was 21, and the desire to smoke was gone completely in months. I thought cigarettes smelled gross and tried to avoid being near smokers. It baffles me I still want to smoke this time.  

I'd love any insight from anyone with a similar experience. I really don't want to start smoking again, but I'm afraid I might cave to temptation one day.

I have a quick question about Chantix.

I am about to embark on what feels like my hundredth time quitting smoking. I am think about trying Chantix to help me. I have health insurance but no doctor I see regularly. Do I just set an appt. for a regular family doctor? It seems weird to get an appt. just for a prescription.

One week in, easy! Til now.

I'm 29 and have been smoking 8 years with a lot of breaks in between. A year here, a few months there. This time I've decided it's over for good.

Got pneumonia, there's a good start. I began tapering off because, well, my lungs were fucked up. It's been a week now since I smoked at all. Been easier than I expected this time.

Went to a party tonight and ended up leaving early so as to not be around the smoking. Felt a-ok until I got home and saw texts that my grandpa is in the hospital. Instant craving. Overwhelming craving.

What do non-addicted people do with stress? My natural inclination is to light one up. What do you do? How do you deal now?

I'm trying really hard to not smoke and it feels hopeless in this moment.

Stop smoking - Take 12

I have tried to quit many times before, even succeeding for six months. But I never really wanted to quit for ME. It was always for someone or something else. This time is different. I'm on Day 6. I posted  little notes all over the house and everywhere I go, I see them: "you're doing great!" or "I love myself more than I love smoking" (an exceptional reminder). 

Additionally, the Smoke Free app has been a blessing. I got the paid version because isn't the rest of my life worth $5.99? Yes, yes it is. If you aren't familiar, check it out. It gives you missions to do each day, one of which led me here to read what everyone else is doing to quit. I guess I took it one step further and here I am, sharing my own experience. 

It is hard to ask for help for a lot of people, myself included. For me to be here, on the interwebs, sharing my personal struggle is difficult for me. I think getting out of my comfort zone may be one more thing that can help me. So please feel free to reach out to me or anyone else if you are struggling. I am here for you. 

We got this.

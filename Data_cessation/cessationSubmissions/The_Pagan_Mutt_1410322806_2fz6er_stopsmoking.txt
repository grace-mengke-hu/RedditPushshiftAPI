Threw away my last pack, for the third time. Tell me I can do this.

I've only been a smoker for two years, but it has already taken a toll. Shortness of breathe after a few flights of stairs, headaches before my morning smoke, you know the drill. I just threw away a pack with 14 left, but my will power always falters in a few days. I guess I'm looking for some encouragement.

Edit: Thanks for the support and resources, you guys rock!

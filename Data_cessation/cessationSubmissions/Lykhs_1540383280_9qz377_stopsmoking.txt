Smoking up anxiety.


I'm a 21year old woman, soon to be a graduate from an engineering college. It has been a hard year. I lost my father and lost my friends too.

I was trying really hard to make new friends and had lost faith in people when I came across a few friends who smoke. I was already using drinking as a coping mechanism and these people taught me how to smoke, properly..

I realised how exhilarating It feels while puffing and I did at every chance I could get. However, I  tried too many drugs one night and decided to stop everything.

 I haven't smoked in 2 months but all I think is about smoking, I don't have access to cigarattes and too scared to buy them and don't get to meet those people I can smoke with. It's so frustration and it kills me each day. But I feel like I'm a lioness waiting for the day I can buy or meet a friend who has ... I thought porn was a good reliever but now I'm getting addicted to it. 

I really can't stop thinking. I just wanna feel relaxed and this is eating me away. 

Please make it stop. I don't know what I'm asking for or even saying... But it just felt nice writing it down..

Today is my first day at office without cig

Today, for the first time I'll be going to office without smoking any cigs. 
I usually smoke 3-4 a day
I used to think smoking cig right first thing in the morning gives me confidence I need to do my job. 
today will be my second day and I'm excited and happy that it's morning and my throat isn't cursing me for putting burning tar in my mouth. 

today will be my real test because usually after I'm done with my job at 10 pm I'm craving for cig like a mad men. 

I just want to feel how non smokers feel all the time!

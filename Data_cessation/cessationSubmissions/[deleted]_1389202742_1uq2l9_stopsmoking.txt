200 days! Never thought I'd get to say that.

First off I want to thank the people here at /r/stopsmoking because without the ability to come here and lurk/read advice from you folks, I'm not sure I would have made it.  So for that, thanks :)

I honestly feel like I've officially beaten the addiction.  I can drink as much as I want, even with heavy smokers all around me, and I don't really feel the urge to ask for one.  I can safely say at this point that I will never, EVER have another cigarette in my entire life.  Feels good to say that. :)

I think I will continue to lurk here, and offer my advice when it's applicable.  I just felt like boasting a little bit since only you folks at reddit and a very select few in my life even knew that I smoked lol.

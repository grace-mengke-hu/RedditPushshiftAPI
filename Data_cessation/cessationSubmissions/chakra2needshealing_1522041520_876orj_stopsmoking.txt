Quit smoking with vaping!

Vaping is a harmless substitute. You only need to buy a vaporizer once but you will have to buy the vape juices frequently. Vape juices only contain, nicotine, the addictive suabtance in tobacco, glycerol, found naturally in your body in large amounts, and a flavor.

Vaporizers do not burn glycerol, unlike cigarettes which torch the tobacco, so it does not have any,of the thousands of carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. It merely vaporized the nicotine juice. You will not experience any heavy breathing or painful coughing. Admittedly, I cough once or twice if I hit it extremely hard. 

Vaporizers and vape juices can be found at any of the numerous vape shops all over the world. You should be able to find one within the three mile radius. Vaporizers do not create an unpleasant smell so you won't be rejected by family and friends who hate second hand smoke. It also doesn't kill endurance. I speak from experience as I play numerous sports and am highly aware of my body. I am also a nerd so I love to learn and share knowledge.

Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any questions.

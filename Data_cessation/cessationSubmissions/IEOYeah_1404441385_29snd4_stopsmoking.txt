So... Harder than i thought.

So, i quit about two months ago.   I had an ecig(which made things way easier in weaning myself off of the actual cigarettes ).   Someone(who shall remain nameless) offered me a cigarette, I accepted. But now I've bought 3 packs in the last week.   What can I do to actually be done?   I had actually stopped considering myself a smoker too... I fucked up... How can i make it easier?

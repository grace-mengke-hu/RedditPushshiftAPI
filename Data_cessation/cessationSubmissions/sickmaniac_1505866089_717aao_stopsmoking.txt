I had my last smoke last Friday.

I'm 50 and been smoking since I was 14, I quit for 3 years once before only because I was in prison from 2013 to 2016.  I smoked probably 15 a day.  Hoping I can stay quit.  My life has been so terrible, lost my little 2 year old boy to kidney disease, went to prison, brother died etc...I just want to make it to retirement age, 67 and maybe get a few years just to relax, maybe watch some t.v. etc.. as I am busy from the time I wake up until I fall into bed.  I've paid my debt to society.  Quitting smoking is just one step in the right direction.  Thanks for your support! :)

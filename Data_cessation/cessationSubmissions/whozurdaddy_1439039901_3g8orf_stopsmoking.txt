Here I go again...

Ok, its day 2 for me.  Maybe I'm a cheater because Ive switched to vaping, but I have to say.... I'm glad to be back on the horse.  Wish me luck!

As for vaping... for others thinking about it.. the thought I have around it is this:  is it the same? No.  But it *is* sufficient.  I went nearly 8 months once on vaping and I felt a lot better.

Edit:  Trying to fix my badge, disregard.. I could only wish I was 1400 days into this! :)

The struggles of week 2

The first week was legitimately easy. No issues at all outside of one night during an argument with my SO. Nothing like stress to get the cravings moving. Regardless, I stayed strong. 

However, starting on day 8, it's gone downhill. The romance of smoking is fresh in my mind. I don't NEED a cigarette, but sweet jesus, do I ever WANT a cigarette. 

Don't get me wrong; I know my reasons for not wanting to smoke. I know this is my addiction convincing me to smoke. I know those first puffs aren't only going to taste awful, but will give me a nicotine buzz so strong that I will legitimately feel like I'm going to die for 15 - 20 minutes. However, knowing these things do nothing for me. I still want it. I want to endure that 20 minutes, so I can have my shitty, smelly, disgusting "friend" who wants nothing more than to drain my bank account before he kills me. I miss that fucker, and if it wasn't for the disappointment of my SO, I'd have welcomed him back into my life already. 

Help.

Weird question alert

So one of the things that’s celebrated on here and on the various apps is when people realise “I will never smoke again”....that’s great, and I look forward to being able to happily say that.....however in my current phase (day 8), it saddens me to think I’ll never smoke again. Like the thought that it’s just not possible and I am NEVER ever allowed! Is this totally irrational given how bad we know these things are? Anyone else go through little bouts of mourning!

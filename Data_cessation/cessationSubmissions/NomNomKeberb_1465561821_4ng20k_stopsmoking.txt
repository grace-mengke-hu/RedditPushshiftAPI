Motivated but 2 weeks before my exam

Hey guys, I'm currently a university student and I've been smoking for roughly 4-5 years now. My final exams are in 2 weeks and i can barely afford cigarettes for the next 2 weeks since i decided to take a break from work to study for my exams.

My question is, will the nicotine withdrawal symptoms affect me alot during these 2 weeks before my exams? Or should I put off quitting until after my exams are finished?

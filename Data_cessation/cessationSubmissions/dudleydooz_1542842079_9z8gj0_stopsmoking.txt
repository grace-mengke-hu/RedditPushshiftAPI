HELP!

Hey guys - Iâ€™m on day 5 cigarette free.

Iâ€™m on patches and Iâ€™m struggling. ðŸ˜“

I used to smoke 10-15 a day and have smoked for 8 years.

Iâ€™ve got such a headache, I canâ€™t sleep and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about â€˜wantingâ€™ a cigarette. I put wanting in speech marks because I donâ€™t actually want one, maybe need?

Any advice to combat the cravings at night time would be great please guys? Day time is the easier part as Iâ€™m so busy at work but evenings and night time is the worst.

Im also going out for drinks with friends on Friday.. Iâ€™m dreading it as would normally smoke a pack of 20 on a night out - any advice for this would also be appreciatedðŸ˜…

Iâ€™m new to reddit so bear with me whilst I get my bearings lol.

Thanks in advance xx

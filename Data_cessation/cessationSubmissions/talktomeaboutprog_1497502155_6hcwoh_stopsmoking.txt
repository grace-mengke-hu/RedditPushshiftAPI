Don't smoke - but scared of addiction

I've been struggling with quitting weed for a good portion of 2016/17. I'm finally done with it, but I feel like I need a replacement. I've found myself taking tokes off friend's cigarettes every few days. I hate this substance because it ruins lives, and I know there's only one direction with something like this. So friends, please talk some sense in to me so I stop doing this once and for all. I don't need it, and I want to keep it that way. I want to fully abstain every time. In fact, I know given I've smoked less than 30 in my life - I know it's incredibly easy to say no for me, if the reason are good enough. I've always been mindless when it comes to drugs and very implosive. I want to never smoke again, because I can - and I have a minimal relationship with the substance. So technically, if I stop doing this now, emotionally it would feel like I've never stated in the first place (again, because there is practically no relationship with the substance at the moment). So my question is, how afraid should I be of cigarettes? Am I being reasonable with my concern? Has cigarettes ruined your lives to the point if you were in my shoes you'd never smoke another one in your life? I'm considering reading a book about the harms of smoking just to become totally convinced that this shit is awful and never say yes to it again, in my life. Fuck you for killing people and ruining lives tobacco. Fuck you.

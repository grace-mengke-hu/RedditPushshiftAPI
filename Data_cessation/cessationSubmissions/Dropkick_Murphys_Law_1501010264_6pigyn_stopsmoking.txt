On day 15, noticed an extreme drop in energy the past two or three days.

It's exceptionally frustrating because as soon as the second day I was feeling the benefits of being smoke-free; I was energetic, I had less back and neck pain from my DDD and herniated discs, my breathing was improved very quickly, my sinuses where no longer swollen and painful, my mood was greatly improved- I felt like a new person and this made me happy about quitting and encouraged me to keep going. Then for the past few days, I've noticed extreme fatigue and weakness, the pain coming back intermittently, and my mood declining, I believe, because of these things. My cravings have increased greatly however I'm still not going to smoke, but I wonder if anyone else has experienced this.

One week in but having trouble...

Hi I'm one week into quitting. 

 I was off work (on vacation) and decided to quit as I only smoke at work.  The week went well - I kept myself busy and avoided the cravings.  

Today I'm back at work. I'm determined to quit, but I am having really bad cravings and anxious as hell. 

Any support or suggestions would be welcomed and appreciated.

Insomnia and dizziness

I'm about 2.5 weeks cold turkey. I've been having trouble sleeping through the night for about a week, but the past few days I've been having dizzy spells. Sometimes I stand up and get vertigo for a moment and other times its lasted for hours. 
I'm wondering if it's a quit symptom or not - has anyone had similar experiences?

(Yes, I'm eating enough and drinking about as much water as I should be)

What are your reasons to quit? + Help and Motivation

Hi Guys, 

Please share your reasons to quit with me. It inspires me to know why others are choosing to quit or have quit as well.

I'm really enjoying this quit smoking community and wanted to share a bit with you as well if you're looking for some help and motivation. It took me about a decade (on and off) till I finally quit smoking. It's a hard process and quite the journey. I'm now almost 3 years smoke free. If you're looking for a motivational story, a quick guide to help you quit, and some homeopathic aids that can really help you out, check out [www.quicklyquitsmoking.com](https://www.quicklyquitsmoking.com). 

Let me know if this is helpful to you all. 

Best of luck! :)

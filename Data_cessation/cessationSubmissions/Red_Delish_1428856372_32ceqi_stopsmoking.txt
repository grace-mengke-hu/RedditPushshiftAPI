Made it this far, but still a struggle.

Today marks 3 months since my last cigarette. But I still really struggle. I smoked on and off for 25 years had quit for several and started again when my dad died in 2008. Thanks to everyone who posts here...this has been way harder than I remember last time but your stories and sharing help. I look forward to the day that I don't smell a cig and want one. Thanks for helping me in not smoking today!

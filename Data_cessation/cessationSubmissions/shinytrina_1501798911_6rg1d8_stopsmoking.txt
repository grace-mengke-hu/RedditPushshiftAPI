3rd day and biggest test so far

I went to a customer's house to do an in home visit and everything was going fine until I got in the taxi to head back home.  The taxi driver had just finished a cigarette by the smell of the taxi, even though they shouldn't.  And for some reason it seemed that everyone on the sidewalks on the way home where smoking.

Needless to say I was so tempted to go buy a a pack at the local store when I got home, instead I came upstairs and ate some peanuts in the shell and drank some ice cold water.  Getting through this one day at a time. :)

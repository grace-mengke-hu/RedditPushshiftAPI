Juul as a replacement for social smoking/any feedback on juul pods?

I smoke socially, generally a couple of days a week when having a few drinks with friends, I’ve never become addicted after many years but I’m starting to notice some detrimental effects to my health - my lungs feel way grimier than they used to after smoking, teeth are starting to stain (though I suspect my love for Indian cooking, coffee and red wine have more to answer for than the smoking).

I really don’t like vaping, the smoke feels choking and, honestly, it puts me off more that I hate having to walk up the street surrounded by a haze of someone’s raspberry fumes.

I’ve been looking at juuls because they’re less conspicuous and the hazy doesn’t stick around. I also smoke rolling tobacco which is common where I live amongst younger people so my habit is maybe only costing me £14 a month (another reason why I consider juul as rolling tobacco is higher in nicotine).

Do people recommend juuls? Also how long does each pod last? I’m concerned this may end up more expensive in the long term. I know vaping is still bad but I consider this a social habit and I’m not willing to give up nicotine just yet.

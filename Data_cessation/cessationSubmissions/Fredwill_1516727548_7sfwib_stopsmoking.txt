Read Allen Carr's book I'm better prepared

What I want to say is that while I was reading things started to make sense.  I began to realize and accept that  cigarettes never gave me any of the false beliefs my mind had created.  I've put out my last cigarette and I'm already a winner.
There's no alternative because this is not  a game it's my life and most important the quality of life that I want to have.

3 months cold turkey and today was my first day of ZERO cravings

Today was the first day of my quit that I didn’t have a craving at all. I’m so excited and proud of this moment! It feels amazing to be a non-smoker. I never thought I would get to this point, no looking back.

Side note: I even went to the casino two days ago and gambled from 9pm to 3:30am and drank gin/tonics the whole time while being surrounded by smokers. I did not even think to ask for one and was disgusted by the smell. Winning!!!!!!

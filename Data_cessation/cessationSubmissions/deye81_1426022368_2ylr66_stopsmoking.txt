Should I vape when starting to quit?

Newbie here. Starting yet another attempt to quit smoking today. In the past when I have attempted to quit, I have used vaping as a strategy to stay away from cigarettes. The strategy works in that I become completely free from cigarettes, but then get addicted to vaping and eventually I fall back to cigarettes. This time around, I'm not sure if I should use vaping as a backup. What are your opinions on this topic? 

TL;DR: Should I use vape as a crutch when attempting to quit?

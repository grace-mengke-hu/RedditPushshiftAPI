Vaping was a mistake

Sitting outside with my vape reflecting on my recent relapses.

Started smoking with a hookah way too frequently in school. Left school, had cigs for a time before picking up a vape. 

The thing about vapes is how easy it is to just keep smoking and little limitation in where you can use it. With hookah and cigs your either locked in place or forced to go outside. With this thing I can use it inside my house, in my car, sad to say I've even taken it in the shower on a bad day... very few limitations. And it doesn't have an end outside of a dead battery. Quitting drinking helped cut down of course but if I'm anxious or stressed in traffic this thing can be sucked on for days. I can tell I've made my addiction way worse than it was before using it. 

So tomorrow's the date I picked to set it down for good. Came up quick so im pretty anxious thinking about it. Probably gonna be god damned miserable through work. Wish me luck.

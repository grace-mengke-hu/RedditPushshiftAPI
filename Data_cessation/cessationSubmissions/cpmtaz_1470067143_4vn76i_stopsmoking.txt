One whole year today!!!

Today is one whole year smoke free!!! I didn't think I would get here 13 months ago. I did. So can you! 
You have to want it, though. Really want it. This time was my 7th or 8th attempt. 
Here's what I did:
1. Download stop smoking app
2.Get rid of all smoking paraphernalia
3. I used gum for cravings as needed for the 1st month
4. I didn't tell a lot of people at first
5. I came to this sub reddit 

The stop smoking app really helped a lot!!! It gave me daily missions & was a place to express cravings & distract myself. 

Not one more puff. You can do it!

Am I the only one?

I started smoking around 18 years old, off and on but not full time until 20. I was in college and had just stopped playing baseball because I stupidly convinced myself that I was depressed and that drugs were better... (I was a starter for a nationally ranked juco team, smh). From 20 yrs old through 23 I never quit, until I joined the Marine Corps. For 3 months I was smoke free and then picked up right where I left off. I quit again 6 yrs later when my daughter was born. I started again when she was 7 months old and have now said I'm done (she's 9mo).  The point of my title is this: I've NEVER experienced a day where a cigarette wasn't the first and last thing on my mind every damn day.  I've also never experienced lack of breath/smell or the hacking cough, etc. normally associated with stopping smoking. I can't be the only one that is in this kind of predicament... To know that smoking is horrible for you, but not experience any negative effects and still crave them all day every day. I've gone almost a year before, how do I stay quit this time?

Computer games became boring after I quit smoking

Hi everyone,

I quit smoking about 3 months ago and it's been very good for my health. I've started working out again at the gym 3-4 times a week and going for walks, cooking my own meals etc..

Since I'm pretty much a loner I have a lot of spare time and a lot of that time went into computer games. Now that I quit smoking the computer games no longer feel fun and engaging. Anyone else feel like that? Not only did I use to head out for a cigarette every hour or so but I also used "snus" (this is like a tobacco you put in under your lip).

Anyone else feels the same way about computer games after they quit their nicotine addiction?
Did you manage to overcome this feeling somehow? I no longer even boot up the computer games at all. Instead I'll spend a lot of time watching others playing on twitch and youtube.

I would not have done it without every single one of you.

Last month, around the 7th of May, I decided that enough is enough and I was ready to kick the habbit. I’m 25 years old and I started when I was about 12. 13 years worth of smoking in my teenage really made me rely on nicotine for everything in my life, socializing, hanging out, spending time on the beach, after sex... you name it. 

Everything and anything was not complete without a cigarette. I posted here a while back that I was scared of quitting and another time that I felt physical pain and that led me to get a vape and eventually get back to smoking cigarettes again. I also gave some pretty bad advice to someone in here about how Allen Carr’s book takes the feeling of accomplishment from quitting, which I sincerely apologize for. 

Anyway, I’m here to say that I’m now on my Fourth day (officially!) nicotine free and I really want to thank everyone (literally everyone) who shares their stories and the great support from everyone in the comments! You make us (future quitters) really excited to start our journey and we all look up to you as great examples.

I’m in no position to give any advice to anyone right now but all I can share is that this time, I changed my mentality from “I have to do this” to “I want to do this”. Every time I get into a stressful situation where I normally smoke after and I get the craving, I always tell myself that smoking the cigarette will not help at all, it’s only a stimulant and it’s better for me to train my brain on relaxing than rely on a cigarette. The last 3 days I went to the gym for about 1 hour day and I eat lots of fruit! Also, Breathing exercises helped me a lot. 4-7-8 method really works. Simply take 4 seconds to inhale, hold it for 7 seconds and then release it for 8 seconds. It will get your focus away from smoking and it’s helpful with sleeping problems too!

I hope this helps and sorry for the long read! Good luck to everyone!

Heartburn "side effect"?

Hi Everyone, 

I am currently on Day 5 of being a better person :) 
Something that has been bugging me since Day 2 though, is this constant annoying heartburn type feeling in throat and upper chest. 

I rarely had it before, but it did happen once in a while, depending on what I ate, so I know the feeling. 

It just dominates 80% of my daytime since I quit....
Anyone else with that problem and maybe know some tricks at home I could try to get better?

Being an ex

so as I get ready for bed I find myself having to put a label on this not smoking thing.  Why must everything have a label, and why do we give it so much importance.  So if I continue to not smoke I will be an ex smoker.  Who knows I am only into my third day, I am consistently checking my app to see my progress and hold on to as much resolve as possible to not walk across the street and buy that pack of smokes.  I am also probably driving you guys here on Reddit crazy as I am reaching out for an excessive unwarranted support from a community that owes me nothing.  I am an ex many times over.  For each ex that I am associated with is bittersweet. Ex girlfriend ex paramedic, ex contractor possibly ex smoker.  I was defined by all of these events in my life.  These were what made me who I am.  These are the things that I leave behind.  With it is positive momentum into an unknown future.  And like with all change we do not know what that will bring and that is always scary.  The uncertainty of being an ex and losing something that defines you leaves you swimming without a life vest.  Yea I had good times,  but it has sucked far more life from me than it will ever give back.  Can I be strong enough to overcome, and break out into a cleaner brighter future.  Wish me strength on this scary journey many of you have been in my shoes and know how hard it is thank you for your compassion empathy wisdom in advance

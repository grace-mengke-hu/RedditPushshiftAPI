I have a mirror with dual use

Hey gang,

Just thought I would share a little bit of info I have found helpful this quit around.

I have a large mirror that I have been using as a "dry erase board" of sorts.  On it, I have the first date in which I was smoke free with a tally of all the days since that I have not smoked.  Currently, I have 8 smoke free days behind me.

In another area,  I have the date in which I purchased the last pack of smokes.  Currently, that was TEN days ago and so I have a tally below that date as well. Ten looks pretty cool.  But below that?

The dollar amount I have saved.  Today, I crossed the $100 mark as smokes are $10.25 a pack where I used to buy them.

Every morning I update this mirror, which is a nice way to start my day.  I used to wake up craving a smoke, now I have a success to remind myself of instead.  These numbers (dollars, days since quitting) stick in my head all day long and so I constantly have some measurable successes on the brain.  

It is really nice to wake up to success and to document it.  I see success every time I look at that mirror, now.  Literally and figuratively. 

Thank you all for continuing to be a part of this sub.  It is nice to have somewhere online where many people are sharing experiences with achieving their common goal.

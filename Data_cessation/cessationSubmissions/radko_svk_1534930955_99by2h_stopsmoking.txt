8 days and super nervous

It is awesome! 

I have to admit, I like the feeling of being nervous. It gives me the energy to be nervous and keeps me awake. It is hard to concentrate but energy is energy and with few breaths I can use it for anything productive. 

It is like productive masochism. Every craving means craving for killing every person in the room, make them suffer, bath in blood of their children and swim through their intestines like in the pool full of colored plastic balls. I know I can't... 

But then I remember, how much energy it means to kill room full of people and I know I can use this energy that finaly drives me to work more, learn more, run more, do more...

Damn I love it!

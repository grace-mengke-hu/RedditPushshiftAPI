Putting on Pounds? Munchies got You Down? Take a Peek Inside

Most people will gain some weight when they quit smoking, no doubt about there. In most cases this is just temporary and you can address those extra pounds after you have a solid quit under your belt.

But-

Don't let this weight gain- munchie issue sabotage your QUIT.

I remember getting creative in the beginning when it seemed like I had a ravenous appetite and could not quit munching...I started trying celery, carrots etc..all that stuff people tell you.

The best things I found were sipping ice water and...Eating Air Popped Popcorn with CHOPSTICKS. One piece of popcorn at a time.

That took my mind of smokes, and gave my mouth and hands something to do. And it's not as bad as eating a bag of chips or a whole container of nuts etc...

Give it a try!

i'm ashamed of myself for not being able to quit even for a whole day

as the title say, i'm ridicoluosl√≤y addicted to smoking, sometimes i'm in the verge of crying when i light up a cigarette.
nothing goes as i want im my life, i'm 19, lazy as fuck, cant keep up any promise i make to anyone, major trust issues with my gf for no actual reason, i have all the motivation to quit smoking, i hate it with all my heart but the need to have a cig is just too strong to overcome.
how do i do it? allen carr book didnt help at all, if anything i smoke more now, i have like 1 and half pack a day and this is already killing me, i have high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues before i reach my 20s.

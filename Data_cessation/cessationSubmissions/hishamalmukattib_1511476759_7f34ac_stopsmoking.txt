Help! I am a 25 male, been smoking since 5 years tried quitting.

Never really happened. I tend too loose my will to quit the next morning. Need some advice from u guys to keep my motivation in check.  I am familiar with the benefits of quitting, Doesn't help.i keep telling myself that my resolve is greater than my addiction.  I still smoke with guilt. Thank you for your advice in advance.

4th attempt soon some questions tho

So I am 24 and smoked for 6 years.
I switched to vaping (with nicotine) when I was 22 for 1 month until I realised that I sucked the e-cigarette dry and in fact took more nicotine into my body than when I was smoking. I decided to cold turkey but relapsed after 1-2 months cause i had an exam comming and thought one smoke wouldn't hurt. Fast forward and i was back to one pack per day after a month.
A couple weeks ago I realised that I run to cigarretes as soon as I felt a little stressed which made me feel unable to handle stress well.
So I decided to stop smoking this month on the 3rd to be exact. I relapsed on the 4th day because I didn't have much withdrawals(weird right?)
I restarted on the 8th but got some bad news today which made me buy a pack and pospone it. But again yesterday and today I was feeling pretty normal even without a cigarrette is that normal?

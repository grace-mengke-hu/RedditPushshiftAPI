2 months, 3 relapses and 15 days smoke-free!

I first tried to quit 2 months ago, in these 2 months I've relapse 3 times and I just made it 15 days smoke-free, AGAIN!! I'm not celebrating my 15 days too much because, honestly, I'm scared, I'm scared I'll cave again. Getting up after each of these three relapses has been incredibly hard. 

I think I've sort of realize that when it comes to addiction, can one really sing victory? I know there are some incredibly strong-willed people, I just feel like I'm a lucky bastard that for some reason has made it 15 days, but I feel like I'm walking on a string.

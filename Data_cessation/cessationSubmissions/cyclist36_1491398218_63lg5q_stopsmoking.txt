Current or former smokers of reddit, how do I politely tell my coworker his smoking is effecting our job?

If this type of post isn't really allowed here, I will delete it. Anyway, a guy I work with in a professional setting is a heavy smoker. It's causing the smell of cigarettes to linger in our company vehicles, even though he doesn't smoke in them. Sometimes you can smell it on him when we are meeting with our customers. I obviously have no right to tell him he can't smoke, but how do I let him know that this habit is bothering his coworkers and maybe even customers?

Dat 3 day hump

I knew it was high time to quit smoking.  I took advantage of the fact that I had a 3 day weekend to get over it.  I know it's perhaps the only opportunity I'll have so I took it.

I went frisbee golfing yesterday.  Other than that though I've mostly just been laying low.

I hate it.  I'm usually such an active person and was hoping that today, day 3, I would be back to my old self and in the gym and being productive.  But it looks like the only thing I've done so far is take a nap and write this blurb.  It's 12:30pm and instead of showering, making breakfast and heading to the gym to sweat I think it's time for nap number 2.  Blah.

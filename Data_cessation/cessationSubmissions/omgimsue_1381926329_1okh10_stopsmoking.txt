Relapsed, shattered and feeling like a failure.

So a week or two ago I removed my badge because I started to smoke again.

I just couldn't do it anymore at some point, all because I had to move out again, get adjusted to new roommates, new city, new job etc. So I just went to a cornershop and got a pack. The moment I felt that pack in my hand I kind of felt like it was my old toxic buddy, the same one who helped me through my highschool years and working as a short-time cook.

I smoked a few and looked at myself through a different perspective. I instantly felt miserable and like the horrible loser I was. "You started smoking again you pig, you gave up on everything you worked for. What the fuck is wrong with you?"

Sadly, I didn't stop after that one cig, I kept going, feeling worse than I already felt and at this point it was just pure to torture myself, because it felt safe somehow.

Last Sunday I smoked my last one, starting all over again. I am eating so much better nowadays, actually lost 3kg (6lbs for the Americans), and my confidence grew a teeny tiny bit.

Keeping an eye on this subreddit in the meantime, something I didn't do first.

Thank you for anyone who read through this, I just needed to get this out of my system.

**TL;DR** Quitting smoking (again) after feeling like a guilty, miserable mess because I relapsed.

Attempt 3, Day 1 for me. Question about reversing the effects of being a smoker

After a couple semi-serious attempts at quitting cold turkey, I'm taking a much more serious approach this time. I used the Nicaderm patch this time around, and quitting alcohol consumption (at least for the first month or so) in conjunction, and have surrounded myself with motivation. One those items of motivation is the timelines you can find around the internet of the all the things going on in your body after you quit (http://www.quittingsmokingtimeline.com/quitsmokingtimeline.asp). Not sure how accurate they are, but it's some pretty amazing stuff.

I have a few questions for ex-smokers out there. One of my main reasons for quitting is cosmetic. I noticed when looking at old pictures that my face has finally started showing the signs of smoker. I'm under the impression that once the wrinkles are there, they're there. Do these signs of premature aging fix themselves after quitting?

Secondly, the patch definitely helps with the "Oh man, I NEED a cigarette, right NOW!" cravings. But those have never been a big issue for me in the past, I'm pretty good about finding something to keep my mind of the short, intense cravings. The hardest part for me, which the patch doesn't help much with, are the random triggers. Things like driving (I was about a half-a-pack-a-day smoker, and 7 or 8 of those cigarettes a day were all consumed in my car, while driving) or after a big meal. How did you fight those kinds of cravings? I've turned to gum, and chewed through nearly a whole pack today, but am already getting tired of it. It also doesn't help keep my hand busy (I think this and boredom are why I smoked so much while driving). 
Thanks for reading.

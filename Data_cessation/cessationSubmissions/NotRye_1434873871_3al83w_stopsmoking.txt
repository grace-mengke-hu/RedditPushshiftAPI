I finally reached 2 months!

I haven't been on Reddit in a few days so I only just realized I now have a 2 in my star.  Yay!  #2 rules!  

On a serious note, last night I had a dream that I was very stressed, and decided to give in and go to the store to buy cigarettes.  Even in the dream I felt disappointed with myself for caving, after making it this far.  I should've known it was a dream, because part of the stress I felt was due to the mini raptors that were trying to attack me in my house.  Yeah, I fell asleep while listening to a podcast review of Jurassic World.  But it felt so real and I thought I had gone back to paying through the nose for the privilege of destroying myself.  Now that I'm awake, I'm glad that isn't the case.  

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking, and congratulations to all of you who continue to stay smoke-free.

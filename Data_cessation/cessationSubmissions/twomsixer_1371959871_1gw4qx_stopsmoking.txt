Sorry guys...

Well, I've decided Im going to go get a pack of smokes right now. Weird, cause it's not really a spurious decision. I'm sitting currently home, perfectly content. And I've been thinking about it for the past 2 hours (which is why I know it's not a craving, because I've dealt with those, and they only last a few minutes) and I genuinely want a cigarette right now. I've been clean for almost 3 weeks, and if anything I think I proved to myself that I could quit when the time comes, but right now I just dont want it enough. Or maybe this is the addiction talking, how can you tell? Well, I'm not the type to dwell on regrets so I won't regret it in the morning, but hopefully I'll decide to quit...again.

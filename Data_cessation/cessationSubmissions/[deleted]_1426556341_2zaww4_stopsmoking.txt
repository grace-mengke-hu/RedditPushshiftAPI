For 2 weekers and up: I'm addicted to the smell of...

fresh mowed lawns, salty ocean breeze, and freshly washed clothes. 
Haha, question for anyone beyond 2 weeks: have you noticed any external appearance benefits? 
Clearer eyes, clearer skin, etc.
Smoking always seemed to make me look/feel faded, almost ashen - especially in the face. I'm only 26. I am also wondering about dark circles under your eyes, anyone have those and see them fade away with quitting smoking?
Cheers! :D

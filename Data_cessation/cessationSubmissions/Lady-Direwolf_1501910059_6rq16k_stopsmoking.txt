Slowly winding down... and am feeling better already.

So... I started lowering down last week from almost a pack a day, to just under half a pack. Ended up with "quitters flu" on Tuesday and am shaking off the last of it. I've decided to keep myself at 5 smokes a day for the next while. I'm feeling a crap-ton better already. I'm more alert, my heart rate isn't going through the roof, I can taste things better, and I can breathe easier!!

Soon... I plan on quitting altogether, but I need to find other things to replace the smoking, so that the shock of quitting isn't so severe with easing into the "cold turkey method". That includes better physical fitness routines (hiking, gym, yoga), mindfulness (meditation, getting more involved with hobbies) and letting myself sleep a bit more when necessary. 

I initially quit smoking a few years back, but picked it up again beginning of last year because of stress. Been averaging just under a pack a day and finally have the courage to let this go. It's funny how being young, you can get away with a lot of crap without too much damage. But with age, it all just catches up with you... and I'd like to avoid that as best as possible. 

Picked up my first cigarette when I was 11... became a regular smoker at 15 (thanks to older friends), and have had a serious love-hate relationship with it for the past decade while in my twenties. And I've promised myself that I won't be smoking past my 30th birthday...which isn't too far away now. I refuse to let myself down any further, since there's no satisfaction from this habit to begin with. It's time to let go. 

Thanks for reading... any tips and suggestions would be wonderful. My best to all of you, for we are all fighting the same battle.

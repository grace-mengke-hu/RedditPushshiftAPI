Struggling to quit and need an extra incentive? I have a revolting do-it-yourself at home solution for you which may help deter those panicky cravings.

I'm not going to post a picture because it's so utterly revolting, and I am back on the cigs after a short cessation myself, but this is making me feel really repulsed so I am determined to keep it out and to keep using it. It's currently sat on the most prominent part of my flat: my work desk. 

Find an empty glass jar - I've used a small jam jar. Soak it in warm water and remove the labels. Now, every time you hack up phlegm, spit it into that see-through jar and put the lid back on. Leave it where you can see it.

And watch those cravings slowly subside... at least, here's hoping. 

Next to the Jar Of My Revolt is an egg timer. When the cravings hit, they're only meant to last three minutes. Turn the timer, go off and do something else, and be pleasantly surprised when you've forgotten about the timer when you return.

It is so, so gross. But sometimes, needs must until success is certain.

For those of you also struggling, be reassured that you are not alone. Do whatever bonkers thing you need to do to make things easier for yourselves.

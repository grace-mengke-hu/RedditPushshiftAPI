The 100 day blues?

Hey guys, I've been quit for however long that little badge by my name says. 102 days so far, and I couldn't be happier!

I problem has arisen though. When I first quit, the cravings were intense but after a few weeks it got easier. So easy, that I hadn't even thought about cigarettes at all. It seems that a lot of my triggers and cravings have been coming back the last couple weeks though... I haven't relapsed, and I'm not sure why, but the cravings I've been getting, particularly this week, have been INTENSE. Almost depressing, and almost relapse-worthy. Last night I was out drinking and I was talking to a girl who was smoking. I had asked her for a drag.... If it wasn't for the fact that she knew I had quit smoking 3 months ago, she probably would've given me a puff or even a whole cigarette if I asked. 

Good on her for telling me no. Shame on me for WANTING that shit. But seriously, what's up with these intense cravings I'm having right now!?

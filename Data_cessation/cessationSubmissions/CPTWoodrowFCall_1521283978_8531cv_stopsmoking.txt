One is never just one.

Heed my warning those who think just one won't bring you back to the addiction cycle. One cigarette turns into one pack which turns into a week straight and you try to stop but the craving headache is back and you are cranky and irritable and the only cure is just one more. If you start again it will pull you back in. If you are sick of starting over, stop giving up.

I just had to accept the fact that I will never have a cigarette again.

I don't know if this is helpful, so please disregard if it isn't... but I've been smoke-free for just over three years. However, before that, I had quit for over two years. Eventually I decided, "I can smoke in moderation!" Nope, I can't. That "smoking in moderation" eventually lead to me smoking a pack a day, and realizing that I needed to quit. Again. And quitting sucks.

As I said, I've made it just over three years in my second long-term quitting attempt. I attribute my success to fully accepting that I can never, ever, have a cigarette again.

I still crave cigarettes, sometimes. Especially when I'm shit-faced drunk and I'm standing outside with smokers. But I've already told myself I can't do it, so the cravings fade quickly.

This has worked for me, so far... your mileage may vary, and I guess mine might too. But I hope to maintain the firm belief that I can never, ever, have a cigarette again, unless I want to go through that awful quitting process again.

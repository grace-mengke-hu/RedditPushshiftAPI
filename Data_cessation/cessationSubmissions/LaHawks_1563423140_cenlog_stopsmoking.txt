Do cravings last forever?

I quit smoking cold-turkey right before my 21st birthday, 4 years ago. I still have the cravings when I'm stressed, been drinking, or sometimes just because I'm bored. I was never a heavy smoker (maybe a pack a week) but lately the stress from work has pushed up the cravings. There's been a few times I had to stop myself from buying a pack. Does anybody else have these issues? Are cigarette cravings supposed to last this long?

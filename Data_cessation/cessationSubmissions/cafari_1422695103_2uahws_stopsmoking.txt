i want to quit, i fail

hi everyone, im 24 years old and have been smoking for 5 ~years now. currently im smoking 1 pack a day ( aprox 20 cigarattes ) my work is with computers so i dont have any change for a physical effort at all. i was an athletic guy before, was not getting tired, i was skating, running, wrestling etc. but now i can barely climb stairs... i tried to quit smoking 3-4 times but all failed. And within all my fail attempts i figured out that im totaly in this thing.. i started to think that its bounded to me.. now im having trouble while breathing, feeling a mass on my chest, coughing and kind of tired all the time. i want to quit this but also i dont believe in myself at all. Somethng inside me says well quit it but u will return anyways so i keep smoking and forget about its bad sides. Mostly at nights when im in my bed, i hate myself for that. Any successful quiters here? and advices? i want to be a healthy and active person again.. this is really frusturating that whatever i do, im always thinking about cigarattes. if i have some for tomorrow? lets eat some snacks so i can enjoy another cigaratte. oh yea this project is done lets smoke. waiting for the bus... lets smoke. what a wonderful day. lets smoke. im actually getting sick of this bounding however i cant break this. And this is even more annoying than health issues. Cigarattes are invading my mind, whatever i do. there is of course a trace of smoking.

-i want to quit smoking, after several attempts and failure i dont believe that i can quit this.. i need advices.



- today i managed to halve the amount of cigarettes i normally consume. Feeling better, will try to focus on avoiding the need and just consume for joy for a while. Which would greatly decrease my consumption i think.

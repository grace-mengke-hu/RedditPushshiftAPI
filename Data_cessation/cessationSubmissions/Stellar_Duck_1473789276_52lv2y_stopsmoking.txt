My journey so far

So, 34ish days ago after I got home from a weeks holidays spent with my girlfriend back home, her having left for her country and I for mine, I decided to quite smoking, so I could save up to go see her again sooner. And to be healthier.

It's been more than a month now. I've saved 150ish quid and that amounts to paying the flight to go see her the day after tomorrow. 

It's been a bit of a weird quit this time. I've tried before and and failed. I've gotten drunk and slipped up and used that as an excuse to stop stopping.

This time I've had her support. When I've slipped up she's encouraged me to keep at it. So I slipped up a few Fridays at the pub and then got back to it on Saturday. 

I use lozenges to take the edge off but have not taken one for four days. I'm getting a bit frayed at the edges, but I can make it. Day after tomorrow I'll be on a plane and it'll all be worth it. 

I genuinely believe that this time is the time. I got her, she has my back and I can do this. Besides, I gotta save up for the next flight.

I realise this was a bit rambly, but I needed to vent a bit.

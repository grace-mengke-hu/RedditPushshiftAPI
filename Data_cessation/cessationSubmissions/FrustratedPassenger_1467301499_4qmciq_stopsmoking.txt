New here and quitting at high noon.

2 cigs left in my purse. High noon is when I'm going for it. I am sick of smelling like garbage and being outside like an outcast because I smoke. My work is going smoke-free in August and I don't want to wait until then to quit. 

I've quit 10+ years on a usenet group many many years ago. I screwed it up by having "just one" and forgetting that I am an addict. Since then, it's been periods of quitting and then blowing it. 

Usenet is not what it once was but I realize I need support & online is best since it's accessible whenever I have a minute. So, I'm learning how to use reddit as a way to keep my hands busy.

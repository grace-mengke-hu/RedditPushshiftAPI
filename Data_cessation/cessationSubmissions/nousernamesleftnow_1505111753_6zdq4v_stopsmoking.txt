Exercise as a non-smoker feels great!

Hey everyone, I'm coming up on 6 months free of nicotine addiction and just wanted to share how good it feels when you are a non-smoker to exercise. When I smoked it wasn't enjoyable, more like a chore and you felt like you would have a heart attack. Now, it's actually fun and you want to be active and it makes you feel better and stronger.

For the first few months I had that nostalgia feeling for how cigarettes, but these days I can't even remember why I liked those damn cancer sticks! So hang in there newbies, you're gonna love being a non-smoker soon enough.

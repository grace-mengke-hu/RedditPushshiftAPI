Does it ever go away?

I say I've been smoke free for a little over a year now, but a few months ago I was hanging with some friends some of which were smoking. That wasn't a new situation for me or anything, and even though I had the urge I resisted. Until one of my friends who had given up smoking a year before that told me that after not smoking for so long that I wouldn't enjoy it, that it would taste terrible and that when he tried it after so many months he thought it was so gross that he never got cravings again after that. So I had a puff, and it was one of the greatest moments of my life. I had a couple of more puffs before the guilt got to me and I threw it out. 

But even today, I still get cravings on almost a daily basis. Does anyone know how long it takes to go away or if it ever even does?

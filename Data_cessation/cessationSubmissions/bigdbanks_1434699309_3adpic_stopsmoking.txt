Any advice for making that last push?

I'll give you a little background. I'm 25 and started smoking when I was about 13, and at a time I was going through about 15/day.  I have managed to get myself down to 6-8/day but am really struggling to make that last push to stop.  I have tried vape, gum and cold turkey, but none seem to work. The truth is I quite like the taste of cigarettes which is just making it harder. What I have noticed is when I think that it's time for one, I cannot get the thought out of my head and can't concentrate on anything until I have one. Has anyone got any advice to help me cut it out?

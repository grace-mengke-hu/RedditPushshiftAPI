I need to quit.......

Its an annoying habit that I cannot believe I picked up. Been smoking for the last 4 years.  It was first only when I drank. I always had a cig after a beer. Now...I do it at work during breaks. I split a box of cigs with my friend at work and now its an everyday thing. I stopped smoking during Lent this year. It was alot harder than I thought.  The first week was insanity. I was feeling down...I had anxiety like crazy from going cold turkey. I got an e cig and yes it did cut down my actual cigarette smoking, but I went right back to it. I cant believe how hard it is to quit. I really do want to quit. I dont know how to go about it right. I guess this is my cry for help I guess. Hello /stopsmoking!

Today was a good day!

I've just told 2 of my friends about me having stopped cigarettes for the past few days. One of them has decided to stop smoking from Monday onward (except for the occasional smoke with a drink).The other friend offered me a cigarette and I refused. He was taken aback (as it was always me who went for a cigarette first). When I told him I hadn't smoked for 3 days, he also didn't have a smoke.

I went for a movie and I waited 15 mins before it started for my friends to arrive. I saw people smoke outside and sort of pitied them for not realizing how trapped they are. If I was still smoking, I would have run outside during the intermission to get a get a taste of nicotine, but I just had a coke instead. I was relaxed the entire time!

Feeling quite happy !

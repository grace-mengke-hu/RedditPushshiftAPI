3rd attempt to quit started today...and I'm not feeling very motivated. Making a BIG life change in a few weeks and don't think I'll make it over that hump without smoking.

I really, really want to be a non-smoker, but I'm just not feeling nearly as motivated to quit this time.  I think a big part of it is I'm making a BIG life change in a few weeks, and I feel like even if I go the next month without smoking (which I'm pretty confident I can do), I'm not sure if I will be able to get over that hurdle.  

On 5/1 I'm moving from DC to Seattle, and I get very stressed about little things, so a 2.5K mile move is really going to start fucking with my shit in a couple weeks.  And while I want to quit, there's a voice in the back of my head saying 'There's no fucking way you're going to a do a cross country move and not smoke,' so why be miserable for my last month here.  I know, I know, its just me making excuses, but its really hampering my ability to get excited about this quit attempt like I was the previous two.

Anyway, that's where I'm at right now with it.  Feeling pretty blah about it right now.

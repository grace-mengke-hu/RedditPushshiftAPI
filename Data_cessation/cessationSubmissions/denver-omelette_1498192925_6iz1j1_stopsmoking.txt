Pack a day to none, patches ftw

I see a lot of folks preaching the cold turkey method, which works great for some. In my case, every time I try to quit the main issue has been the habit dragging me back down. Smoker for 15 years, 10 of which were pack/day. That is a lot of behavioral conditioning, think of any other ritual you do 20 times a day.


Patches have helped me through my first month because they allow me to focus on the behavior first, the chemical later. The first week I thought I would go insane because I was used to always stepping out for a smoke. Gum, toothpicks, mints, water bottle. I have a Tupperware full of grapes in my freezer to chomp on if I start needing something to do at night. Taking walks around the block has been amazingly helpful as well as conscious breathing exercises.


Chemically I've walked away from worse than nicotine, but nothing is harder than walking away from a 20 times a day ritual. If you are struggling to quit, please don't feel like a nicotine replacement therapy is a weakness. Sometimes building a healthy headspace needs to come first, find things that will fill those gaps in your life (and seriously throw some grapes in the freezer). The need for the crutches diminishes over time though I recommend walks and breathing exercises for everyone regardless.


Above all else, even the anxiety attacks, don't go and buy that pack.

Day 1 round 2

My quit day is 2 days away. This is my second time around and I’m nervous. I have a history of depression and anxiety and I’m mostly worried that I will fall into a depression hole. :/ does anyone have any tips for warding off/helping the depression be more gentle? 
Another worry with the depression is that it makes everything seem pointless and my motivations seem like they just don’t matter. Even though in my heart I know that they do. I’m just trying to breathe and remind myself of the things in life that I actually enjoy when I’m not depressed. But wow the anxiety is hitting :/ this time around though my mom and I are quitting at the same time and I’m really hoping that this helps.

Opinions about my situation: e-cigarettes or complete stop

Hey guys, I was wondering on what you thought of as e-cigarettes as a way to quit once and for all. (This is a long post with a couple of questions). I'm abroad right now and only have access to regular cigarettes. I've been smoking them on and off for a couple of weeks now. Basically I'm at the age where most socializing means drinking which is a trigger for me to smoke (especially when others go outside for a break). Also do you notice a certain paranoia after you smoke? At first smoking made me feel great, now it just feels like something to pass the time and even e-cigs make me feel that same paranoia. Do you suggest quitting caffeine (which is another trigger for me) simultaneously? I appreciate opinions and advice from everyone here but would like to here especially from smokers who gave it up in their late 20's/early 30's. I'm 21 now and don't want to smoke past my 20's.

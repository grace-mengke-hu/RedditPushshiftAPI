11 Day - This one is harder :)

So today i my "date" forgot about our 3rd date and called me to say sorry just before we where supposed to meet. Since the first 2 where great and she was the one asking... i was pretty upset and went with good friend who is a smoker to get my mind off. 

Damn, that was hard to dont start just then :) i often dont realise how smoking numbes emotional outbreaks and how we are used to smoke more if something irritates us.

now i go for a 30m run and hope it will help me get over the day.

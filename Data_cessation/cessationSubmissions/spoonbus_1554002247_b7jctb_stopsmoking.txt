Sometimes the day is just too shit

I've been tryna quit and it's been going alright but sometimes a day is just so shit that I'm just like fuck this , fuck everything , I'm fucking done. 

Let's see : 
1. Boyfriend broke my 300$ beats and refuses to pay for them 
2. An old man said to me "you may look like a ni***r but you're a pretty young lady " (I'm not black, I'm Persian) 
3. Another old guy followed me and wouldnt stop trying to talk to me. 

That all happened in 30 minutes. I'm only 17. I got so overwhelmed I just gave up :( 

Thanks for letting me rant a bit , here's to trying again tomorrow

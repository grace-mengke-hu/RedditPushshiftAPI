The devil leaf is a devious bitch

32 days no nicotine, 55 days no cigarettes. I was having a hard time today, with near-constant cravings, each one telling me that cigarettes would 'solve ALL my problems', 'make everything awesome'. Had a couple of pints during the day, so my resolve was down, and then when I open my front door to go get dinner what do I see? A whole goddam unsmoked cigarette, literally on my doorstep. I vacillated. I picked it up. I even gave it a little whiff. I threw it in the trash. The devil leaf is a devious bitch.

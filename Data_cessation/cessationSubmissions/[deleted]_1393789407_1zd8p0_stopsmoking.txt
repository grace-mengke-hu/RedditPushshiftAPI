Stuck in the house on day 19

I woke up 19 days ago and decided to just quit. My fiance and I used the step 2 patch for about 5 days each and then went cold turkey after. It's been going quite smooth. Other than packing on 5 pounds in the first week. (I ate whatever, whenever.)



He has friends visiting from out of the city at the end of the month. Smokers. I know there is going to be temptation but I also know that we're stronger than our minds.



I know that *guilt* after relapsing. I don't want to experience that guilt ever again. In the past 2 years we've quit 4 times for months at a time. 



Smoking is definitely not enjoyable after being a non-smoker. You don't feel fulfilled after having your smoke, but your guilt will guide you to another smoke and that's where the chain reaction starts. (for me anyway)


I want to avoid the guilt at all costs. The guilt of having one cigarette. That's all it takes.


Don't give in and have a smoke, it definitely won't be worth it. 



after only 19 days I feel more clear in my head, much more energy, better moods, just over all feeling better! I don't want to ruin that with a dirty, sticky cigarette.

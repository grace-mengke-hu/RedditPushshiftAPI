Quitting cigarettes but do not wish to stop smoking weed. Will it have a detrimental effects?

Hello People of r/nosmoking.

This is my first post on reddit. 
I have been smoking from 4 years now. Weed and cigarettes both.
From the day I started my body has rejected cigarettes vehemently, to the point that I go without smoking them for days and do not even need to smoke one unless I'm in a group of smokers. Whenever I smoke cigarettes my head starts aching, body  becomes highly restless, I feel like throwing up and everything else people feel when they are not smoking cigarettes. (Yes it's the opposite in my case). I DESPISE THOSE LITTLE SUCKERS!!

The only reason I haven't quit yet is because of no company of people who quit. Stumbled upon this subreddit today and finally made up my mind to stop it once and for all.

Now coming to my question.
I also smoke weed (8-10 hits a day) and TBH it helps me calm the fuck down and focus on the task at hand (I have some issues with my mind from before I started smoking). I work almost 15 hours a day (10 hours in office and 3-6 hours for my own company) and smoking weed helps me keep awake, work hard and also enjoy the small things in my life. I'm not saying it's totally right, i'm just saying I don't feel awful about smoking marijuana daily, the way I feel about smoking cigarettes .  

So if I keep smoking up and make a conscious effort to quit cigarettes, will it be detrimental or will it help? 
Thank you all in advance for 
a) creating/maintaining this amazing support group and helping scores of people quit the worst thing in their lives. 
b) Reading the post and giving me your valuable suggestions.
Cheers!

Update : I have decided to stop smoking weed too for the next one month for better self control and discipline

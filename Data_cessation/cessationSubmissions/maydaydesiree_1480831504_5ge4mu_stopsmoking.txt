Keep going back and forth

I'll go a few days without smoking, then smoke 3 or 4. I've been doing this for about a month and I just want to be done. I hate feeling like I need to smoke to feel like myself. Any ideas on how to get past that? Also while driving I always want a cigarette. Any ideas on how I can keep myself occupied while driving? Hope you all are doing well with not smoking!

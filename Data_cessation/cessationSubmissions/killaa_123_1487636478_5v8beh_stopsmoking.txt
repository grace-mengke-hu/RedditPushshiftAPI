Quit today !

Okay so have tried quitting since last year, actually went a month without it until i got super drunk one day and smoked. then i went 2 weeks without it after that day but then he feeling of smoking came back again and i ended up smoking again and then the cycle of quitting for days and relapsing started ! i dont ever want to smoke again so i decided to write this post to prove to myself im serious about it this time !

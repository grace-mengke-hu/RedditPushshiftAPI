What is everyone’s take on those CBD vapes?

Hello and happy Monday!

Here’s a little back story on me if you’re interested. I am 24 years old and picked up smoking cigarettes at the age of 16. Went through many different spurs of quitting/vaping but I can say with confidence that I put out my last cig in January 2018. Made the switch to Juul for a whole year and I finally put that down back in early February of this year and have been nicotine free since. I am loving life like this, but still get the occasional cravings here and there. I have yet to cave and don’t plan on ever going back. But I was at a bodega this weekend and I saw these 0 nic CBD juul pods behind the counter and it hit me, could I possibly still juul without being addicted to nicotine??? I would probably use this to relax on the weekends only and not make a habit out of it. What do you guys think?

help!!! today i feel like i need to smoke...

i quite 51 days ago. still miss it from time to time, but i am at a point that i can even drink alk and not crave a ziggi.

but today has been a hard day, cuz one of the reason i smoked it to deal with frustration, stress and loss. i've gotten over most of the urges but today a year ago my dad passed away and i am still sad and think about him alot. so now i want a zig, really want one.

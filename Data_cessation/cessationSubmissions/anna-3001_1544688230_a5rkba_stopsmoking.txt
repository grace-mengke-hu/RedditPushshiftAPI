First time feeling free

Yesterday was the first day I actually felt the advantage of being a non-smoker after more than a month not smoking. My colleagues and I went to the Christmas market after our courses &amp; we drank quite a few cups of mulled wine. It was only one smoker in the group and she forgot her pack at home and she got soo nervous and started to ask random people for cigarettes and I just thought: „I totally know how she feels but oh my god how embarrassing does this look &amp; how nice does it feel to not crave a cigarette like this.“

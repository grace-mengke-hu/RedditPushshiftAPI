9 Days in on chantix

I have tried EVERYTHING. cold turkey, patches, gum, lozenges, cutting back, you name it I have tried it. Chantix though has been the only thing that has worked for me. but what I'm interested in is what people have done after chantix or really just in general after they were done using patches or what your method was to quit? I realize chantix isn't forever and I do not want to fail. Thanks!

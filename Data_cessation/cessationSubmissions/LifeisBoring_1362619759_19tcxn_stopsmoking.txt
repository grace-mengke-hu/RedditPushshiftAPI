Why does it always feel like I try to quit at the worst possible moment?

I "reset" my badge today. Apparently, I tried to quit smoking 332 days ago. I don't really remember what happened, but I don't think it lasted very long.

Every time I try to quit, it's like life sees me stumbling and decides to give me that extra push into the dirt, just for the hell of it. Then I say, "I can't quit now, it's too hard now, I'd rather be unhealthy than miserable." And then I start smoking again and put off quitting.

This last week was hell for all sorts of reasons that I won't go in to. But I finished my last pack on Saturday and now I've made it to day 4 of quitting, and I'm actually going through with it. Strangely enough, I feel like this is going to be the time where it finally works.

Maybe it's good that I'm quitting while I'm at my lowest. It's (hopefully) just going to get easier from here.

It feels good to just write this down. I'm glad this place is here.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words. All of your positivity is really encouraging and almost overwhelming. Really, thanks.

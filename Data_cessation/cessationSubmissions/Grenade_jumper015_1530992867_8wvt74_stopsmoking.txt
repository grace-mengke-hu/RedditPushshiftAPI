Giving up ALL the vices

Iâ€™ve just been approved by my surgeon to have weight loss surgery before the end of the year, however during my first meeting at the beginning of June, he said he wouldnâ€™t even think about touching me if I didnâ€™t quit smoking first ðŸ˜« So, after 8 years, I have 17 cigarette-free days under my belt!! I feel so much better, but I know this is only the first step. Not only am I giving up nicotine, but I also have to give up caffeine, alcohol, and basically food too if I want to be successful after my surgery. Trying to stay strong and not self-sabatoge is the real struggle.

6 days since I quit

Hey guys, been smoking for 6 years and this is my first real attempt at quitting. Apart from the odd pangs, it's going pretty good. I already feel my breathing is getting back to normal and my sense of taste has improved too. I'm using an app called Smoke Free which is great at tracking progress; the app also has a widget which acts as a constant reminder. This group has been really helpful too in motivating me. Hope to be able to continue this and lead a smoke free life. 

P. S. I'm new here, can someone help me figure out how I can get a badge with days since quit?

It is getting closer.

The day of my quitting is moving closer. (3/16) In the time leading up to this, I am doing everything I can get build my plan. I have been working on my workouts, I moved to fewer working hours in the day and took steps to make sure I start working to my dream. 

I am building a Workout that will help me make the best use of quitting. I am trying for something that is low impact on my joints (Overweight) but will get my heart rate. Back to pushups, body weight squats, long walks, watching my diet and deep breathing. 

Quitting is my motivation, Living is my goal. 

I am tired of being held down. 

I will do it, I will move forward and in the end the results will be worth the cost. 

Hail Hydra!

Benefits of being free from cigarettes

Hey guys, 
it's been 7 days since I stopped smoking, and I'm already seeing huge benefits. 

For those who quit, why don't we list here the benefits we have experienced since we stopped ? I'm sure we can inspire others to stop smoking, or stay cigarette free. 

I'll start.

- My skin is so much better. I've always had greasy skin with acne. Now my skin already started to heal.

- Energy and motivation is through the roof ! Now I realized how the stinky carousel made me lethargic. I feel that as a smoker, I was living my life at 60% of my capacity.

- The shame is gone. I always felt stupid and guilt when I smoked, and I felt crap when I didn't. Now I'm free.

Can't wait to see yours.

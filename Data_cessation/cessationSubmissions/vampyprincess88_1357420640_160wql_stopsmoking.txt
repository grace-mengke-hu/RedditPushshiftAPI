Shivering makes me crave a cigarette?

My smoking spot was always in my car.. It's so cold now and waiting on my car to warm up is tough. I sit there and start shaking because it's cold but the cold air makes me want to smoke so bad. I've made it this far. Next week I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled out.. I have to go through this withdrawal now before I'm in pain and can't go back anyway.

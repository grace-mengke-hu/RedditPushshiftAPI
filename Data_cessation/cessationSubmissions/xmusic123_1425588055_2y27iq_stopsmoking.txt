Quitting Nicorette?

I've chewed nicorette for about 6 years now, while smoking on and off throughout it. I'm well aware I'm completely addicted to nicotine, and recently, I've begun to question if I'll just be addicted to nicorette my entire life. 

Rcently I've decided to make a real effort to quit cigarettes, and it's really helped. In the past 3 weeks I've only had 5-6 cigarettes, and hated it every time (friends were smoking, thought I'd bum one). 

I'm sort of ambivalent to being addicted to nicorette, because the health risks are low, it's just easy and I still get my coveted nicotine buzz. 

But, has anyone tried to quit nicorette? Is it easier or harder than quitting cigarettes? I hate e-cig's because all I do is puff and puff and puff all day as if it's an oxygen tank, so they're out.

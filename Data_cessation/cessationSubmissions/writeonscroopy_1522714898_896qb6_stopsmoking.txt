Had double digits ... now back to day 1. Sigh.

I made it 12 days without cigs and was so proud of myself! Then some friends came over on Friday night and mood-altering substances were consumed. I caved and smoked more than half a pack. Had some left over and smoked them today. Now they are gone, and I'm back to day 1 again. 

This is a setback, for sure, BUT I feel much better about quitting again this time around. I really think that something clicked last time, and I wasn't craving a cig, even when I saw other people smoking. I don't do psychedelics very often, so I think if I refrain from doing them again until I'm sure I'm over smoking I'll be OK. I have been vaping and chewing nicotine gum and that's definitely helping, but I would really love to make it a full 30 days without cigs and quit for good. Onward to another new day!

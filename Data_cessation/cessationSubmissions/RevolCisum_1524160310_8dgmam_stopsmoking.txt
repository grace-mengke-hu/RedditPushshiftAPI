Struggling but succeeding, mostly

Just needing a little support today.  Had a really rough past couple of days, pretty sure relationship with bf is over.  Feeling hurt, rejected, shattered, and struggling to self soothe.  Of course, first thought is cigs, had a few drags yesterday, back on lozenges today.  Just really needing to hear some positive reinforcement today if anyone is up for it.

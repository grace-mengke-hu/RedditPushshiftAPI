I havent smoked in four days. Boyfriend is making me quit. Im depressed and shaky and I dont want to quit (yet).. Please help?

Hes quitting and says I have to quit with him. I was a pack a day smoker for ten years (since I was 15, Im 25 now). I know that I should quit in the future, I just dont want to yet. My family is all fucked up and I have a lot of problems in life. I also dont drink anymore and dont smoke weed or anything, so nicotine was my everything. Ive already gained 3lbs in these past four days. Im eating everything in sight and im losing my mind. I just wasnt ready to quit yet, but my boyfriend is proud of me for going as long as I have. please help? :(

Blessing in disguise 

On Wednesday I had 2 wisdom teeth removed. As part of the recovery I am not allowed to smoke for 4-5 days to prevent dry socket (a horrible and painful thing). Because of this, I am now on my third day of non-smoking and feeling much better! I know that my hardest days are before me, but I know I can do it!

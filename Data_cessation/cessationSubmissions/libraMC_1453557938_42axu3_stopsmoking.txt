36 days off and I still miss it

I've quit smoking on december 18th 2015 and my cravings are pretty easy to ignore now. However it seems to me that I don't really want to not smoke anymore.
Everytime I see someone smoking and enjoying a cigarette I just wish I could join them, I wish I hadn't quit. 
It's a stupid and irrational desire and I don't plan on starting again, but right now it's hard to ignore these thoughts like "just one" or "you don't have to quit right now, you're still young!" 
Is anyone in the same situation as I am?

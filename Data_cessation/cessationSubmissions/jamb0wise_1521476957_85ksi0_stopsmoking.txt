Been a month and a half, but...

Everything in my life is so shitty right now and I just want to fucking smoke a ciggerrette, it helped with the boredom I feel, gave me something to justify my tiredness, gave me a way to separate the time of the day and break my monotonous routines I seem to harbour constantly and find impossible to break out of.

PROVE ME WRONGGG... please... because my willpower to quit has been slowly diminishing all week!

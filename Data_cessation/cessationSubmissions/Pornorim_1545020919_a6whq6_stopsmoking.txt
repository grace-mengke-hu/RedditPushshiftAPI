I've quit 5 days ago

Hello everyone!

 5 days ago, I had my last (hopefully) cigarette. I am 27 and I started when I was 18. I am trying to quit for 7 years. I quit multiple times for a few months. My record is 14 months 2011/2012, I was 100% sure I am free and then I started again.
 Last year I read Allen Car's EASYWAY book and I quit instantly. There was no cravings or depression. Literally, I read a book and I became a nonsmoker. Unfortunately, because it was so easy to quit, I started again after 6 months, thinking I can quit anytime. I have been struggling for a year. I read the book over and over again, but couldn't bring myself to stop, not even for a day. Finally, I managed to pull out 5 days and I feel free again. I WILL NEVER EVER PUT THAT (BEEEP!) INTO MY MOUTH!

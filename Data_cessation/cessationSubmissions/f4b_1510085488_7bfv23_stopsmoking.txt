Just checking in ...

Hey! I haven't posted here in quite some time. I saw a picture of a guy who stopped smoking somewhat five years ago. It showed the packs he would have smoked by now. I figured: wow, I haven't somoked in what? Turns out, my batch showes that it has been 2402 days. Would you believe it?

What can i say? Quitting was one of the best descisions of my life. I didn't get superpowers (yet), but quitting smoking was one of the "keystone" habits that changed my life forever and it keeps on giving. Eventually, I will end up with superpowers one day...

But here is my truth: I don't mind cigarette smoke, I don't dream of smoking anymore, I don't carve cigarette smoke, I just... don't smoke. Like in "sorry, I don't eat this ashtray". And I don't know about you guys, but I hardly see anyone hanging out in front of the bar or during lunch time smoking anymore. Do people still do this? I honestly don't know.

Quitting smoking has lead me to be waaay more concious about my life decisions in many aspects that go beyond pure "health" related questioning. I am more confident, generally more resilient about everything and more self-concious about the signals my body and my mind are sending me. 

And the money. Quitting smoking is something that makes room for a cool hobby that you didn't even know you wanted to pick up, like building a pc, or learning how to fly drones, or whatnot.

Without you guys, I wouldn't have made it. It is so super awesome and I still fill so super grateful. Just wanted to say thanks! And to all the lurkers out there: GET A BATCH, POST AND SHARE YOUR STORY. You will not regret it.

*how to IMHO: cold.turkey. (i.e. no dipping, vaping, chewing gum, no nicotine.) Read "Easy Way" again and again until it "clicks".

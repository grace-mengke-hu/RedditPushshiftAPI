Quit today, wish me luck.

Just had my last cig, I'm 19 and have been smoking a pack a day (sometimes more) for about 5 years. Today, I went out for a jog with a friend and the difficulty to breathe afterwards is what did it for me. I realized a smoking man isn't the man I want to be. I only have one question, I read somewhere that one of the withdrawal symptoms was difficulty concentrating. Do you find this to be true? I have really important exams in less than a month and don't want to fuck em up because I couldn't concentrate. I'm sure it's just bullshit, or happens to only a small percentage of people, could you clarify this for me? Thanks in advance.

Phantom Withdrawal While Using the Patch

Even though I'm using the patch, around the times of day I'd normally smoke I get the headache and odd feeling I'd normally get from nicotine withdrawal. I know its all in my head since I have the patch, which makes it easier to ignore and go about my day, but its weird. Anyone else get this?

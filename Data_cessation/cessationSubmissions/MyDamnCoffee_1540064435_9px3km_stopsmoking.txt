First few hours

It's the longest I've gone without a cigarette in forever. The feeling in my chest, the craving, peaked and abated and was literally immediately followed by a sharp stabbing feeling above my right eyebrow. That then spread into a head ache and general malaise until I finally just gave in and got a few smokes off my neighbor. 

I want this but maybe not badly enough.

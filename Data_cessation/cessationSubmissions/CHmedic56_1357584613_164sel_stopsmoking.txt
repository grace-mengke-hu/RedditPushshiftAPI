Not as bad as i expected

I am on Day 6 since i smoked my last cigarette. I am not going to say that there haven't been times when i had really bad cravings but they always pass. I know I am healthier and I just signed up to run a half marathon in May. I decided i am tried of being unhealthy and it is time for a change!

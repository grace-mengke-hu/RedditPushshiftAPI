How I got over the 3 day hump

Good Morning!

 

So I’ll preface this by saying I’m trying to get my badge corrected right now, so if you see "699 days" that's from my last go around where I failed about two days in and felt too ashamed to change it. 

 

I quit cold turkey 4 days ago, and last night started vaping at 0mg. The first 3 days were fucking hell - I almost broke at least 4 times every day. Having a hit of a 0mg juice on that vape was the most relieving feeling. A little reward I gave myself for making it through the hard part and I think it mildly tricked my mind into believing it was given nicotine (I quadruple checked to make sure it was 0mg, trust me. I don’t want that nasty nicky). 

 

So I think I’m going to keep the vape around when any really bad cravings come in. I don’t want to use it all the time, as I like see myself become independent of a habit, but it may help me from failing again. I can’t tell you how proud and happy I am of myself for making it this far. I have so much respect for all of you too after knowing you all faced the battle as well. 

 

For those just starting: I’m fighting cravings by chewing ice, drinking cold water (really cold water), chewing minty minty gum and expressing how angry and irritable I am. As morbid as it is, explaining to my bf how I’m gonna murder everyone has become a pretty hilarious game. Also running to this subreddit to read ya’lls post in those first three days have been SO helpful. Thank you everyone, seriously. You’re saving my life. 

 

[This song]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0Zjxu4V6c) helped me put the habit in the correct light, so if you're not convinced , maybe Logic will help you quit. 

 

 I believe in all of you, and I hope you believe in me!

Boyfriend quit smoking, need some advice.

Okay my boyfriend has been a pot and cigarette smoker for the last 10 years or so. He stopped smoking weed just last April, due to work and hasn't touched it since. He's 31 now and he quit smoking cigarettes just over a month ago. He's been doing really well and dealing with all of the withdrawal symptoms like a champ. 
Things have been a little hectic as we're in the middle of a move and he's suddenly not doing as well. He's mentioned that he feels depressed and empty due to "giving up all his vices." 
I'm doing my best to keep him occupied in other ways, video games, working out, sex, going out, etc. but I don't know that it's enough.
How do I help him through this? I just want to see him happy again.. It was his decision to quit and I'm really proud that he's taking on the challenge. I just don't know what I can do to help get him through this difficult stage.

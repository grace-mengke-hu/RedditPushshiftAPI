Oh the places you'll go (Counting my blessings)

I'm not around here much these days, but I was thinking of this sub today.  I just got back from a nice vacation with my son.  I'm divorced and our summer trip together is a big deal to both of us.

I count my blessings when I think of it.  Quitting smoking keeps coming up at the top of the list.  Perhaps my list will help someone on the edge or already started:

* My son was already ***so*** proud of me for quitting smoking.

* The police had to remove someone from my flight.  The delay did not bother me.

* We went to Universal Studios.  I think they have smoking areas, but I don't know where they are.  

* I was able to be present for my vacation from early admission until they closed the park.  This included being on one line for well over an hour.  If I got cranky or impatient or anything like that, it was because of the heat, not because of nicotine.

* I stayed at a place where you can't smoke anywhere (even on balconies).  No sweat, just like last year!

* I drove for hours at a time in a rental car.  It smells fine.

* Most important:  I didn't plan my day thinking about when I could smoke.  Before I quit, this was a constant part of my thinking.

It really is a freedom.  I hope you grab some today, and I wish everyone here success.  Cheers.

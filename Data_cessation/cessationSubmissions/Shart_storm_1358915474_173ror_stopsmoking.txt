Holy Cannoli! 1 week!

Seriously guys I have an extra $62.16 to play with! (that being how much I spent a week on cigarettes)

I don't have that much of the extra money to play with though, now that I do have it I've been using it to afford better quality food. I've gained a few pounds even though I switched up my eating habits to much healthier ones, but I've been reassured time and time again that after a few weeks or so my body will adjust to the completely different chemistry and normalize, how has everyone else's experiences been with that?

Again, thank you so much guys, a week is a big deal to me, I'm the kind of person that if I hang onto an idea for more than a week it is a HUGE deal.

How did you or do you plan on beginning your quit?

How do you choose a date, what do you do to prepare?

Do you cut back or go cold turkey?

I've tried like 10 times to quit, using the cutting back method, and it just doesn't work, how do you guys go cold turkey?

I wish I could just take a vacation from work to quit smoking, but I can't afford it, I really think if I had a week to myself to preoccupy myself I could do it.

I don't smoke cigarettes at work, I already don't bring them, so I don't smoke for 8 hours a day, but I still do right when I get home because I'm so stressed from work.

Sorry sort of a rant, I'm pretty desperate to smoke, I'm 24 been smoking since 18.

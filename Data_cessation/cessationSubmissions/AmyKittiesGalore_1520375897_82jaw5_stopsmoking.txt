Still dreaming!

I’m at the point where I never have cravings anymore and I am totally fine to be around smokers, I have no conscious desire to smoke anymore. The strange thing is, I dream about smoking every single night! It usually involves buying cigarettes or trying to find my pack. The imagery of the pack is always there. I smoked light blue American Spirits.  It is really teaching me how deep in my subconscious the addiction goes, and how effective tobacco marketing is, to make the pack so deeply ingrained into my brain. Often I wake up disappointed, thinking I really smoked and then relieved that I didn’t.

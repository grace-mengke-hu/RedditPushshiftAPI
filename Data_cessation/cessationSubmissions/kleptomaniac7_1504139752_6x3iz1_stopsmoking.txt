Numerically, on average, how much does smoking increase blood pressure?

Say the average is 120/80. If this person was a smoker, what would their numbers look like? 

For reference, I'm an otherwise healthy male, 27, fit, 5'11, eat healthy and don't do drugs or alcohol and my latest numbers today (after a period of extreme stress for the past two months) were 116/86. 

And yes, I do smoke. About 15 a day for 10 years. I would like to quit.

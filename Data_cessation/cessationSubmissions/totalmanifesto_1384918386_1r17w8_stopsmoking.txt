I'm going to quit tomorrow/next week/next month.

I've been going to quit tomorrow/next week/next month.... (etc. you can see where it's going) for almost a year now.
I don't want to be dependent on cigarettes, however, it's hard to straight-out want to quit because I know cigarettes make me feel good. I don't know where to go for the motivation. Don't shoot me down please, I already understand that I'm weak in regards to this. What do I do reddit?

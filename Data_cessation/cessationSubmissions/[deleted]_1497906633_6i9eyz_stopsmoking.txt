3 days

Not sure what my tag says since I'm on mobile. I tried to quit and then bought a pack right after that... This time I've gone 3 days. I had one cig on day one because I had a rough night at work and wasn't strong enough to ignore the cravings. Also I smelled the cigs on my coworkers after they smoked and it was irresistible. 

But tonight I'm going to crack open a cold one, and binge Overwatch. No cigs. Gotta keep going. I know 3 days isn't much but I have confidence I'm going to make it. 

Wish me luck out there.

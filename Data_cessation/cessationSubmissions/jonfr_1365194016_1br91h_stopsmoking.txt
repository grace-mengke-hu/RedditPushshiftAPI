Empty pockets

Isn't it fantastic to carry so much less crap around in your pockets. This is day 9 now and I must say I feel great, my wife even managed to get me to go for a run.  
A few cravings today but they didn't last long and I just went outside took some big lungfuls of fresh air and got through them. 
For the last 20+ years I've always had at least one (usually two) lighter in my pocket, cigarettes or rolling tobacco and papers. Suddenly I find myself liberated. I have a spare pocket!

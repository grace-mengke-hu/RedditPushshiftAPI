35 days and 2 hours

I started smoking when I was 15.  I have smoked off and on since then, sometimes a pack and a half a day, sometimes just a few a day.  There were years of abstinence but I always went back eventually.  I turned 40 a few weeks ago and decided I would not smoke one cigarette past my 40th birthday.  I quit 35 days and 2 hours ago— about a week and a half before my birthday.  I read Alan Carr’s book, which I recommend, and I’m taking Wellbutrin. I was on Wellbutrin for ADD before this. I’ve been on it for several years, but it’s probably made this easier.  

The addiction only continues because we convince ourselves we need nicotine and are afraid of not having it. The withdrawal only lasted a few days and wasn’t that bad— the mental part is the hard part. The physical withdrawal is SO overstated by people. Stop putting it in and you’ll stop “needing” it. Best wishes to everyone here!

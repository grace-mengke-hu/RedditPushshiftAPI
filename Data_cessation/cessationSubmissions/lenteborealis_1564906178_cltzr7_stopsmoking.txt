Difference between Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" and "The Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking"

Is there any difference and if so, what are the differences?  
Is it written from a stereotypical view of women? Because that would probably just annoy me.  
I really hope one of these books helps with quitting :) What is your experience if you read it?

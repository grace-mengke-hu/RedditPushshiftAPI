Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell.

One thing that happens to many people when they quit smoking is they begin to realize how pervasive the smell of tobacco smoke is, and how particularly noxious it must be to nonsmokers. 

I had one of those moments yesterday when I pulled a stack of exams out of my backpack to grade.  I swear they smelled like smoke, and I haven't smoked once since they were turned in.  The smell actually got INSIDE my backpack and made everything smell like it's been sitting in a seedy trucker bar for twenty years.  

Now I have to hand them back, graded and with that smell on them, knowing that all of my students now know a little something about my past.

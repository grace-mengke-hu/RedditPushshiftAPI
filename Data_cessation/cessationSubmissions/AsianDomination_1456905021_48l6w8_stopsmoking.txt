In the process of quitting

I used to be a half pack or more a day guy but in the past three weeks I've only had maybe a half pack. I vape so i still get nicotine but I get an itchy throat and cough lots. I've read it's caused by my respiratory tract repairing itself. Has anyone else had the same problem? If so what can I do to help ease it. I've being thinking of stopping vaping for a couple days to see if that helps. Just looking for some advice.

My cigarette addiction led to another addiction. Beware.

On average, id smoke about 15 cigarettes a day. A pack or more if i was feeling stressed out, but more than that and my throat would just feel like shit. 

Through reading Freud, i learned about oral fixations. Smoking is an oral fixation. The need to feed your mouth with something. If its not cigs, its alcohol, or weed, or... [ahem] ...vaping. 

“All i need is a healthy substitute then!” So i chose gum, and god-fucking damnit it worked. I quit cold turkey and every time i had the urge to have a smoke, i went for my pack of gum instead. Minty and delicious breath. 

The problem is, I became very dependent on gum. I’d chew the same piece for 5 hours at a time. If i ran out, id freak the fuck out and go buy a pack. I started feeling withdrawal symptoms if i didn’t chew for more than a day. The withdrawal felt like anxiety but in the mouth. Like it desperately needs a teet to suckle on. 

Needless to say, i tapered down until i came down to a healthy level. This took a few years.

Oral fixations are a bitch.

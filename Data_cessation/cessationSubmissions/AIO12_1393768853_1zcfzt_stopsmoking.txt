One YEAR today!!!

I had to stop by to thank everyone here. I really couldn't have done it without the support I got here, especially early on. 

Don't ever give up! Even if you slip, you're still an ex smoker. Don't let that one mistake kill everything you've worked so hard for, and keep your head up. You really can do it!

For those who have messed up in the past, how did you cope with it?

I'm only 2 days into nosmoke, but I'm struggling pretty heavily. I've smoked for about two years, up to a pack a day sometimes, and while I'm determined to give up, what should I do if I slip up?

If you've slipped up before, was it just one cigarette? Or was it more? 

Apologies if this is poorly worded!

Victories are everywhere

I just wanted to make a quick post to say that in the last week I've had uncomfortable conversation with my S.O., went out drinking with friends, had a pretty brutal fight with an old friend, and had my debit card breached (been fixed), and STILL DIDN'T SMOKE. In my previous quits, any of these anxiety inducing situations would have kicked me off the wagon, but I'm finding that my head is clearer without cigarettes. I'm able to regulate my emotions better now that I don't have extreme cravings. 

Excercise has made all the difference. If you're going through a lot of stress, take a walk or a jog when you want to smoke. That, and sex, are nature's stress relievers. I urge everyone who's struggling in their first weeks to remember that we're in control of how we let stressful situations effect us. You can spiral down into despair, or get sweaty somehow and get that m'fing dirt off your shoulder!

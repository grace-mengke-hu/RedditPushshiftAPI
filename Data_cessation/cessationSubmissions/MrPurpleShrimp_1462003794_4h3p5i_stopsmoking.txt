Two Day Countdown Clock

So I only have thIS weekend left before my Stop Date. One of the main reasons my partner and I have decided to stop is the money side of things as we are on the verge of buying our first home together.

I am just wondering if anyone has had much success thinking about it from a financial point of view? I have the smoke free app so looking forward to watching the pennies add up!

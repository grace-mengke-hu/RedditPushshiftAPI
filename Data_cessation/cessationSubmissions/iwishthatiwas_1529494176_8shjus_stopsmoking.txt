Sorry for the rant

Today is/was day five. I slept 4 hours. I also had an exam this afternoon. Between 6am and 2pm I fought with myself. I wanted so badly to walk to the shops and buy a pack. I knew I’d hate myself. So I forced myself not to. 

Then I had to go to uni. At uni, I was tryna find smokers so I could pinch a cigarette. I knew it was wrong, and luck was not on my side (thank fuck) because I could bot find one single person who smoked on a campus of 20,000 students (not including staff). I was so angry. (Campus is smoke free, only place that sells cigarettes is a 15min walk)

So im at home, now. Been at home for about 3 hours. The urge to smoke has not gone away. The first four days were breezy as fuck. But now. I’m sweating in 12deg c weather. It feels like my skin is crawling, and fuck I just want a cigarette. 

But i promised myself I’d stop. So I’m fighting with myself and my body.

Tips for fighting the craving?

I'm 17, and I had been smoking for nearly 5 years (I know, ridiculous) . I used to have the "I love smoking, why would I quit?" mentality, but decided that I had to give them up now before it really affected my long term health.

It's been four days since my last cigarette, but I keep getting really strong cravings. Right now, I'm at home sick, so I don't have much in the way of distractions or places I CAN'T smoke like school. 

So if anyone could provide some tips or tricks for dealing with these cravings I would really appreciate it. I didn't think I would make it this far, and I think with a little bit of help I can kick smoking for good.

Thanks for reading guys!

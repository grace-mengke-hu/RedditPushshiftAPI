Saving more money than expected.

According to cessation nation, I've saved $147.85 to date (based on New Jersey cigarette prices). That's great itself, but I realized that my savings are probably more than that.

I thought about what used to happen when I'd go and buy cigarettes. Drive to the convenience store - that costs gas (even if it's only a very short drive, it's every day). Half the time I'd buy a Red Bull - that's $2-3. I'd often realize I didn't have a lighter, so I'd spend a buck to buy one. Maybe pick up some candy, too - another $1-2.

Just the amount of money I wasted merely by going to the convenience store so regularly; I think I'm probably saving about $11-12 a day instead of just the $8 on cigarettes.

Smoke free holiday

I've been smoke free for basically 3 years. Basically because when I went back home for holidays I'd usually smoke. Home is both a trigger (good old times and friends, everyone smokes in Italy!) and it is relatively easy to stop when I'm back to work in UK .

Relatively. Last time been very hard and it is getting progressively harder. So this holiday I've decided not to bullshit around relapsing. I've come here on the 27th and I haven't smoked a single cigarette, not even the customary Christmas one with my mom.

And I just wanted to boast about it =) stay strong!

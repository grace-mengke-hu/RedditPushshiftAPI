7 years today

Well, hard to believe that it's been a full 7 years since the last time I had a cigarette.  I don't even think about them anymore with the exception from my calendar reminder that pops up on Aug 29 saying it's been another full year since you last smoked. I was a pack a day guy for 20+ years. Here's my reddit post I made from just after I quit.

Good luck to everyone out there, it is worth the effort to be smoke free.

20 years old, been smoking for 2 years. Decided it's not worth the health problems and risks. Last cig was 4pm (UK Time). I have a few questions?

Im hoping i will get a cough, as this is a sign of repairing lungs, when will i expect this.

Also as I've been only smoking for 2 years, will it be easier to kick the habit than say, a 10 year smoker.

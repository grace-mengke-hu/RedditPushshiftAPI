Quick badge question, if I may?

Not sure if I should ask this in another thread or if starting a new one is ok...  please forgive me if I'm breaching protocol here.

I believe myself to be mentally challenged apparently...  I cannot get my badge to show up.  I had my last smoke on Sunday the 6th of this month...  I have sent a request to the BadgeBot...  3 days after, and again this evening...  Yet I appear to be badge-less.  The body of my submission was simply "2013-01-06" - seems simple enough...

Help?  I'm not having craving problems, but my lack of badge makes me want to smoke.  J/K...  figured it would yield a quicker response!  ;)

Thanks everyone, BTW...  Your stories and encouragement have made this the only success in my life going down this road!

Just found this sub! 14 days free!

Hey guys, just found this sub today. 
I wish I'd found it before, it would have made week one a lot easier. 
It's awesome to see all the support here, it's super positive and productive!
Im two weeks smoke free, I've done pretty well (this time quitting) really threw myself into my work during week one and distracted myself away from smoking. 
The real test comes when I catch up with my mates this weekend for a beer. Keep up the good work those in week one! It's a lot easier now!

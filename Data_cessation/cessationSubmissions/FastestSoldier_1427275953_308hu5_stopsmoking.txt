Trying again

I've only used tobacco (snus) three times during seven days. Now it's time to stop entirely. 

I'm struggling with stress. Currently serving in the military. I've only been here for two months, so we are still treated like "the new guys". Often there's a lot of stress and you never know what's gonna happen next. This week has been pretty relaxed though and I'm going home for 10 days this Friday. Therefore I thought this would be the smartest time to stop using tobacco. 

I'm really struggling. When the stressful day has ended and you sit in your room with friends you should be relaxed. But I'm not. Not as long as I don't feed my body the nicotine it's craving. I'm still tense. Obviously, this is not good for me and it takes a lot of my energy. Almost feel like I'm caving. 

Hopefully this addiction to nicotine will mostly go away during my 10 days away from the military so I can function normally again. I'm also reading Allen Carr's easy way which I find motivating. Because I know I'm not giving up anything when quitting tobacco. But it's still hard with the stress and withdrawals.

I've tried so many times to quit now that this will be the final time. And I will succeed. I'm tired of going trough this pain and stress because I try to quit once every damn month. Stopping using tobacco is something I really want, but when my body wants the nicotine the most, I always trick myself into believing that I don't want to quit anyway.

Advice for quitting smoking tomorrow.

After 15 years of smoking I've decided that tomorrow is the day I will quit. It's definitely a combination of different things that are pushing me to quit, but mostly it's the moments where I stop and think "If I continue smoking, it's entirely possible that I will someday soon just not exist anymore" that's pushing me to do something.


I've read Allan Carr's book twice and am obviously still smoking. I live with my boyfriend (who doesn't smoke) and I find myself only smoking at work, never in the evenings or on weekends (assuming I'm with non-smokers). 


My issue is, I don't believe that I have an addiction to nicotine as I've gone hours, days and weeks without smoking with no withdrawal-like symptoms. I don't replace cigarettes with food, I don't find myself irritable or even have cravings for a cigarette in the evenings or on weekends. I only smoke on weekdays, driving to and from work and on coffee and lunch breaks. If I don't have cigarettes at work, panic sets in. Sometimes I'll find myself thinking that I won't have a cigarette on my way to work, but then I think that my morning might be ruined if I don't have a smoke (even though I know it won't be) and the thought of not smoking on a coffee break, I think the same thing (If I don't have a smoke on my break, then I'll just regret it and be miserable until I'm able to have one - Again, logically I know this isn't the case) 


My plans are to distract myself at work, go for a walk instead of smoking, snack on fruits or vegetables instead of smoking, etc. 


I'm wondering if there are any ex-smokers who were like I am and what worked for you, didn't work for you, and any other help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 


Thanks everyone!

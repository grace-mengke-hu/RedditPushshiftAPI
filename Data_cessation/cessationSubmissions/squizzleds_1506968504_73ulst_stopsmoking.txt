Stay with it guys!

Just dropping in to confirm it does get easier. 

Anxiety does become possible to endure without a cigarette.

You can go all day without thinking about it. I've discovered I can now smell cigarette smoke on people really easily and it smells terrible. Really pleased I don't smell like that anymore

Good luck!!

Day 28 - proud

It's almost 4am here. I'm high as a flying fuck. Sitting on my yoga mat on my terrace, also slightly drunk. I went out with a great friend who is a smoker. Didn't carve too much. I made spliffs with dried home grown sage. I came home recently, I feel so happy. I craved for maybe 10 minutes total, and we were hanging out since 8pm or so. We used to smoke a lot together, we both rolled same tobacco, always shared rizlas and filters. I feel great cause I am a social persond and i still like other unhealthy things, just not tobacco. I HAD FUN AS A NON SMOKER!!!!!

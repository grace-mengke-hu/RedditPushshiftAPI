Coping with anxiety seems impossible after quitting. Sometimes.

It seems like I picked a stellar time to quit smoking. It was almost simultaneous to my anxiety spiraling completely out of control. So out of control that I have had to medicate myself. Sometimes I think, "Maybe this isn't the right time to quit smoking." I have always used smoking as a way to cope with my anxiety. It is a crutch that I sorely depend on. I am 26 and have been leaning on that crutch since I was 15. This is maybe the 10th time I've tried to quit smoking in my life. I'm hoping it will be the last, but sometimes, when I'm on edge, it doesn't seem worth it. It used to be so relaxing--going outside, removing myself from a situation, meditating over a cigarette. 

But maybe it's a perfect time to quit? I no longer feel like shit in the morning when I wake up, I no longer smell like shitty stale smoke. I don't have to hide from my coworkers or parents. I can exercise better.

But FUCK is it hard sometimes. Does anyone have any ideas about good coping mechanisms for anxiety to replace smoking? Gum doesn't seem to cut it.

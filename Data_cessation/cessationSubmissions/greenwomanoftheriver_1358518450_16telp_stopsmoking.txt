I'm back and going strong!

After several failed quit attempts over the holidays, this time is sticking! Three weeks and going strong! There have even been some MAJOR stress triggers and I haven't even contemplated going back to smoking... I've also managed to get off the patches quickly this time and have been completely nicotine free for over a week!

I feel awesome and I'm proud of myself!  If I can do it, so can you!

Things that have gotten better in just 3 weeks:

Flavors

Sex

Breathing

Scent

Energy

Drive

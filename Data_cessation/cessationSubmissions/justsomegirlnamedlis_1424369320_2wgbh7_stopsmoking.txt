Checking in on day 23!

Just checking in.  Things are so much better than I thought they'd be and I can't believe how much easier it's gotten. My physical cravings are long gone and my mental cravings are pretty easy to manage. Went to the doctor last week and it felt really good to say I am not a smoker.  
Still feel like a smoke when I have big emotions, but that's getting easier. One thing that helps me is to remind myself that I AM THE BOSS OF ME!   It might sound silly, but I'm stubborn. It's good to remember that not smoking is a choice I make for myself. 

Just wanted to check in and give some encouragement to those in the early days of cessation. It can be done.

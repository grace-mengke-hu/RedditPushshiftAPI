Anyone else experience high blood pressure?

I smoked for 4 years, a pack a day, sometimes more. I stopped a month ago and haven’t touched a cigarette since. 

I had to go to the doctors today for a check up and they advised me that I have high blood pressure, I have never experienced it before and my life is no more stressful now than it was before I quit.

Just wondering if it’s a side effect of not smoking and if anyone else has experienced it?

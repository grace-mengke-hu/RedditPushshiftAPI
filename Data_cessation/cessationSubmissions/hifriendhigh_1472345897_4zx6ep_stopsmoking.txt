Felt the urge this morning and stopped myself after visiting this thread.

I felt the urge to smoke this morning, possibly because I have a new job and/or possibly because I am taking longer breaks between Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban) pills, which I used to quit smoking. It's night now and I feel much better. I am also totally relieved that I didn't cave earlier after hacking up some yellow gunk from 10 years of smoking. Thanks /r/stopsmoking/

4 days down, a lifetime to go!

I quit smoking [four days ago](http://imgur.com/5Nf1i7T) and I feel fantastic and horrible at the same time!  I'm moody, I'm exhausted, I've got serious mood-swings... but I know I'm doing the right thing.

I'm quitting because, for the first time in my life, I've joined a club for a team sport - roller derby.  I love it so much but I really struggle with the endurance because my lungs are wrecked.  Yesterday, I beat my personal best in endurance laps (23 in 5 minutes, you need 27 to pass your skills test) and today [this happened!](http://i.imgur.com/E0NVmRx.png)

Now I know neither of these things are particularly impressive in the big picture, but I feel like I climbed a fucking mountain!  :D

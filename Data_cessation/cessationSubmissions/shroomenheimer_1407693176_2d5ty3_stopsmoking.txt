So I just quit out of nowhere and I'm kinda lost.

So I woke up today and coughed my way through my morning cigarette as usual. I had no plans of quitting and have been smoking for roughly 12 years. For some reason I felt especially shitty today and didn't have the energy to go out for another one for roughly 4 hours (in the morning I usually have 1 like every 45 mins). I decided to take a shower before I had another smoke which is very out of character for me after already going 4 hours without, and during the shower I kinda just decided to quit. No forethought, no preparation, no nicotine...it was a great feeling, but now I just want to smoke. And I did this so spontaniously that I'm not sure how to deal with this.

 I'm going to take my son out because I don't smoke around him either way, but after that I really have no idea. Guess I'll get some dip and some refills for my ploom ecig thingy. Not even sure the point of this rant but fuck it, DAY 1

I'm quitting.

I'm gonna quit. I'm a 23 year old male with anxiety/panic and have been smoking since I turned 21. Ive been getting moderate blood pressure readings lately and I got another today and the prehypertension really hit me this time. Has anybody had a good experience with quitting smoking and lowering blood pressure? Also, should I quit cold turkey or ween off? I smoke about 7-10 a day.

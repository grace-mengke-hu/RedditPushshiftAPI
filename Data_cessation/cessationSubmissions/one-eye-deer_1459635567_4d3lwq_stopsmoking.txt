Tomorrow is 90 days smoke-free, and $450 saved.

I didn't think I would make it; the last time I quit, I slipped up and had one here or there. I made it a few months, but didn't actually make it 100% smoke free.

Tomorrow, I haven't touched a cigarette in 90 days. I'm repulsed by the smell now. I still crave a cigarette from time to time, but it's not enough to actually spend $10 on a pack and get back into it.

If it gets tough, remember to take it one day at a time, and that eventually you can get to this point too. You just need to be motivated, dedicated, and have the willpower to do it.

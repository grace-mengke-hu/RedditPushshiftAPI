First post

Hi, this is my first post. Tomorrow is my quit date and I'm nervous and scared. I've been trying to quit smoking for what seems like ages. I've tried so many different approaches and nothing has worked. I started vaping in March and then picked up the cigarettes again a couple of months ago. I didn't go back to my normal amount of cigarettes that I used to smoke but because I have been trying to quit some days I'd smoke more than others. I have been in the insanity for too long and it's time to go cold turkey. I've spent too much money, time, effort, health and so many other things on nicotine and I have never thrown away so many cigarettes in these past couple of months than I ever have in all of my years of smoking. I'm coming on here for support as I have tried doing it alone for too long and not reaching out for help. I've read a few posts and can relate to alot of the lies that we believe to keep us smoking. My biggest obstacle is the fear of withdrawal and how I will react when I'm having a craving. Thank you to all you have posted on here and shared their experience, strength and hope. I've only read a few posts but plan on continuing to read and post on how I'm doing. Thanks for reading.

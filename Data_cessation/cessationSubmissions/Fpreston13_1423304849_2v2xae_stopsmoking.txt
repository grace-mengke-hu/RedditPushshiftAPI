6 weeks smoke free - here's what's helped me so far

Hey guys,

I've not smoked for 6 weeks, so thought I'd share what worked for me so far as it might help some other people!

- Choose to quit at a time where you know you'll be free from stress, in an environment where you don't accociate with smoking. I quit when I went back home for Christmas which worked for me because I was relaxed and my parents don't know I smoke, so I couldn't be popping out for cigarettes all the time. I'm so sure I couldn't have go through the first week anywhere else

- if you break and have a cigarette, don't stop quitting - keep going. I broke after my first week and had 2 cigarettes one night with my friends. Instead of seeing it as total failure and going back to smokin full time, I decided to carry on as I did the next day, not smoking. I haven't had a cigarette since

- be nice to yourself - it's okay to be emotional, angry and irritable - it's hard giving up smoking!

- exercise - I run 3 - 4 times a week and I find it really really helps wit the cravings.

Hope that helps and good luck everyone!

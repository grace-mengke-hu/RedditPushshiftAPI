Friday night drinking and cigarettes

It was friday evening, pal's birthday party was getting fulfilled and after all there were around 15 of us drinking alcohol and going every now and then to take fresh air. I was being offered my favorite cigarette brand + mini cigars which are my absolute favorite. 

I declined politely and every now and then people offered cigarettes again and again and again. I declined every time and afterwards I feel now like a million bucks! 

Allen Carr's Easyway book has really changed my way of thinking about smoking, stay strong reddit people!

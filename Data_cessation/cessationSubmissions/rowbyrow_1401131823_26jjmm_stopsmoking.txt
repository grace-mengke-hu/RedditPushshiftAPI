This is my quit day

Just smoked my last cig, here goes nothing, Haven't had an honest quit for about 2 years in which i lasted 4 months.. I'm 22 years old and I'm sick and tired of having to go out for a smoke every hour... before my last quit i was around a half pack of day.. since i started back up its progressed to a pack a day. So here it goes....

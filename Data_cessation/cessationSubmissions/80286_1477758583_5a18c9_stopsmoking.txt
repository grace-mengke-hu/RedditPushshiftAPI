Difficult day

Due to a very stressful week, almost chronic level of insomnia and depression left by yesterday's drinking, I had really bad cravings today. For the first time into my quit I considered bumming a smoke from passer by (the classic "one couldn't hurt" thought). 

Didn't happen, but it was worrying.

Went two and a half months without a cigarette, but a few nights ago I had a really rough night emotionally and lapsed.

Bought a pack, had a smoke, and felt great. I threw out the pack soon after because I know that a lapse can quickly become a relapse, but I've also learned that I need to find a way to get through extremely stressful times. On normal days I find cigarettes disgusting, and in all of the stressful situations prior to the other night I didn't even think about it, but now I know that there are times when I'll want one badly again. Any tips, Reddit?

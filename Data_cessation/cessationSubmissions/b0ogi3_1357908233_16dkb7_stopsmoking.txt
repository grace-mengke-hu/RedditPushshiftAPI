Gradually stopping smoking can't get under 2 a day.

So I started slowing my smoking from 12 a day to 2 a day in the last month. I tried going cold turkey but for some reason I can't.

As a back-story, I've been smoking for 8 years now and recently thought I should stop, but due to the fact that my roommate smokes and has no intention of smoking it's kind of hard. I managed to get from 12 to 2 but I can't get to smoke 1 a day and then possibly none?

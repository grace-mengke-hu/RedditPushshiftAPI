One Month

So I started smoking when I was 18 and smoked for 9 years then quit and didn't smoke for another 2.5 years lots of thanks to this sub for that first jump. Just over a year ago I started back. I was lieing to my wife about it and smoking around a half a pack each day I was a work. I tried quitting a couple of times during that year always coming up with excuses. I think the main reason I kept smoking is I didn't want to quit. 4 weeks ago today I was out smoking a bummed cigarette and realized I didn't need this anymore. I quit quietly, didn't really tell anyone. I mentioned that I was cutting back to my wife. But now I am one month and I feel so good. I quit for Me and it was the right reason. I am running again and just started trying to eat healthily. I put on around 10 pounds I'm the last month but those I can lose. I just wanted to tell this community that each of your stories help me on a regular basis. Knowing that a group of people know what I am going through.

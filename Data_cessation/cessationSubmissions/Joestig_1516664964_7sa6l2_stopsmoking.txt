Made it just past 60 days, but I failed! Now, 4 days later I learned my lesson and I will not relapse any longer!

It was late at night, I came back from a long workweek and a great evening. I was hitchhiking with a man I met, who happened to live in the same city on the other side of the country. We had a good conversation, and he happened to smoke. He offered me one, and somehow it seemed like a fine idea to accept one.

...and when I was back, late at night, I got a package! During the past 4 days I smoked about 30-35 cigarettes in total. Pretty bad.

However, it could have been worse. I am realizing now what I am doing and I feel calm about it. I feel like I am in control and I can decide what I can do now. I don't believe the addiction has come back in full force now, if I quit now I will have to face some slight discomfort for 2-3 days, but I believe that the worst will be over then.

I learned my lesson, which is that smoking can always come back, so I will have to watch out even after quitting for months (and not even thinking about smoking for most of that time). I will need to reflect a bit more on how to prevent this. Perhaps I should have an alternative with me at all times, such as gum. 

But for now, I will not smoke again. My next triathlon is in 5 weeks and if I quit now, my lungs will have cleaned themselves enough to allow me to do well.

My dream for this year is to win a triathlon, and I have decided to do everything I can to realize that. For that reason, and many others, smoking has no place in my life. So, dear cigarettes: goodbye again, I hope to never see you again!

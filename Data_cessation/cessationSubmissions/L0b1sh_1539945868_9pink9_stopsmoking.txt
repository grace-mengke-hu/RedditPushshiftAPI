How can i support my wife quitting?

My wife has decided to quit smoking, she has before when our kids were born but always started up again. After some recent personal events she has decided on her own accord that this time is it.

I have always supported her efforts but this time i want some advice to help her and to be supportive as possible.

People who have quit what did your friends, family, SO etc do to help? If anything at all.

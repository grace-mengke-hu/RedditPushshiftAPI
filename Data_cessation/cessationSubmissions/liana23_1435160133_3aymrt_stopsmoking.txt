another helpful book

I know we are all big fans of Allen Carr on here but I wanted to share another book that helped me prior to quitting.  It is called [Change Anything](http://www.amazon.ca/Change-Anything-Science-Personal-Success/dp/0446573906) by Kerry Patterson.  The book, as the title suggests, is about how to make any change in your life but I think it applies to quitting smoking quite well.

The basic argument is that too often when you are trying to make any sort of change in your life, you rely purely on will power alone.  Will  power is like a muscle, and like any muscle that you try to use continuously and put strain on day in and day out, it will eventually fail.  If you try to make a change in your life, including quitting smoking, and rely only on your will power to get you through, you will fail.

The good news is, that there are a lot of tools that you can use to help you out when your will power muscle is failing.  The book outlines focusing on six areas:
1. personal motivation
2. personal ability 
3. social motivation
4. social ability
5. structural motivation
6. structural ability

The idea is that if you utilize and plan in all six areas when trying to make a change the chances of that change being successful are far greater than relying on will power alone.  I realize that some of the six sound a little abstract but the book does a good job of explaining them, I promise!

The book is a very easy read and it describes all six areas at the beginning and then provides specific examples of how to apply all these six areas to specific changes (beating an addiction is one).   

I wanted to share this with you guys because I think that often when we slip up we give ourselves a really hard time and this book explains that often our plans are ill-fated from the beginning, but also explains how to effectively make changes going forward.

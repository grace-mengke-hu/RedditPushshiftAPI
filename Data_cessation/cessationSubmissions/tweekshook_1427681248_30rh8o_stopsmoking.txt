7 Days strong through a trying week.

Last smoke was 3/21. After that pack I decided I would be done. I've decided to quit for my health, for my friends, and because I'm tired of every gas station I go to grabbing them before I ask them to. Instead when I went in Sunday for a coffee and bottle of water, I told him no. The man said congratulations. It felt good.

Then the fracas happened. I've been a Top Gear fan since i discovered it in 04. I've seen every episode at least 5 times. 
My birthday was the 25th. More or less the unofficial death of TG. Great. 

My SO decided to drop me, apparently I'm not emotional enough. Admittedly I'm not, I really only have happy, and love. I don't let other emotions get to me or make decisions for me. I don't lash out, bring personal problems to work, or vice-versa. I'm level headed, and will share what I damn well want to. I was gutted of course, and emotions came out then, but I still can't change myself.

But boy did I want a fucking cigarette. I can change certain things though, and I decided that I didn't want to smoke - and I'll succeed.

Hard part is work. As a DirecTV tech, I deal with a lot of people. Some smoke in their homes, some follow me while I try to work while smoking. I have a lot of road time, which I used to smoke a ton while driving.

Well, that's enough for now. I needed a little vent. 7 days strong, and the rest of life to go.

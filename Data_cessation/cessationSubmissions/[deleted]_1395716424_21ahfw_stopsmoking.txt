So, I bought the e cigarette...

I'm quitting smoking for the second time. I started smoking about a year ago after successfully quitting for a year and a half. I made a post a few days ago asking if anyone has had to quit twice because this time is so much harder. I couple of users suggested I try the e cigarette so I bought it last week. It hasn't worked; I'm still buying backs of cigarettes because it's not the same at all. Not only that, but lately I'm seeing more and more articles (coincidentally?) about the dangers of e cigarettes. The fact they're not FDA regulated scares me a little; who knows what the hell I'm actually inhaling. 

So, I've decided I'm going to cut the behavior entirely. Tomorrow. I appreciate their advice to use the e cigarette but it's just not working for me. I'm going to go back to using the patch, which is how I quit the first time.

Seriously thinking about quitting, but my SO won't

I've always "planned" to "eventually" quit smoking (it's been a pack/day for 5 years), but lately the financial benefits have made me a lot more serious about it. One thing I'm concerned about, though, is how it will affect my relationship. My SO smokes, too, and has little desire to quit, so I'm worried that being with him will either make it harder for me to quit, or that quitting will cause a rift in our relationship since smoking has always been something we enjoy doing together. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Thoughts?

Saying Goodbye To The Little Nicotine Monster

Hey guys.

Around three weeks ago I made a promise to myself to quit smoking as a New Year resolution. I originally planned to have that 'one last "precious" cigarette' right before the clock strikes 1st January, and so decided to read a few posts on this subreddit for motivation.

I came across someone talking about Allan Carr's 'Easy Way to Quit Smoking' and so I spent all day reading the book, and then watched the film on YouTube.

By the time he said 'Now I'd like you to smoke your last ever cigarette', I was already completed overjoyed by the realisation that smoking is just an illusion. Before today I genuinely thought that I would be losing something dear to me, but now I have realised that it was all just a trick enslaving me to slowly killing myself.

After the film finished, I headed outside for my night time cigarette before bed, thinking 'Great, I've seen this movie and now I'm determined to quit tomorrow'. All of a sudden, it dawned in my mind what I had read; there's no such thing as one last cigarette. 

Immediately I started to tremble and become excited whilst puffing away on my cancer-stick, with a strong urge to say 'That's it, I'm done'. I felt like the universe was telling me to stop putting it off, and just do it already.

Each drag was like a countdown, and by the time I'd finished the cigarette I was ecstatic, and I knew that I never want to smoke again.

That cigarette was special to me, not because I was in belief that I was becoming relieved from stress or that the nicotine was calming me; but because I truly believe that it will be my last smoke ever, and that belief makes me feel extremely positive of kicking the addiction, and saying goodbye to the sinister little nicotine monster lurking inside of me.

Thank you guys for enlightening me about this book, I am ever so grateful, and to all of you who are also leaving your addiction behind; I hope you have an amazing smoke-free new year!

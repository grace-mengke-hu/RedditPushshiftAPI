I quit smoking for my wife's Christmas Present, 4 days in and I need a little help.

So a little preface to this situation, I weened down the amount I smoked for two weeks before just stopping on the night of Christmas eve, so the first couple of days weren't so bad, however yesterday was a nightmare for me.

I can feel something missing from inside me, I take deep long hard breaths and it feels like I am missing something from each one, almost like I am not getting enough air. Then inside my head I can feel this intense feeling and everything just becomes so painful and stressful to deal with.

I don't know what to do to help myself. I read up on all sorts of tips about quitting but everything I read just says "try to manage stress". That doesn't really give me any specific direction to go to. Anyways can anyone here help me out please? I just need something to get over these awful mood swings.

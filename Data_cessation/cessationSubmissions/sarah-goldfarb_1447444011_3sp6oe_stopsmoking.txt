The return of smells

My absolute favorite part of quitting is the truly bizarre and delightful process of regaining the ability to smell. It's so random... like I'll be washing dishes and suddenly my tap water smells like sulfur. And every time I get hit with a new smell, I wonder: is this what everyone smells all the time? Or do they just stand out to me more because I'm not used to smelling them? I feel mildly like a colorblind person who's wearing those glasses that help them see color for the first time. 

Even though it's been mostly bad smells so far, every smell is a pleasant reminder that my body is healing. Best of all, I can taste things again without having to add 3 tbsps of salt. 

What's the most surprising, pleasant, or strange thing you've smelled since you quit?

Here we go (again)!

I've learned from my past failures to quit smoking, and am ready to give it another go. Since all of my slip-ups and failures have involved alcohol, I'm limiting myself to no more than one alcoholic beverage at a time until I'm completely nicotine free for 6 months. I'm loaded up on gum and have an emergency supply of Nicorette Mini Lozenges.
So far: 24 hours smoke-free.

Let's do this.

Drinking n smoking

I can’t help smoking when I drink, even one or two beers and I’m craving a smoke. I haven’t had a sober smoke for 4 months but as soon as I have a drink I have a smoke. Typically drink once or twice a week. Anyone have any tips on having a beer or two and not craving a smoke? I know not drinking is the best solution but can’t quit drinking and smoking at the same time haha

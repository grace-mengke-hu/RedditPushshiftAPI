5 days in, no problem?

So... I stopped smoking 5 days ago. I have been at least 20 a day for the last year and a half. However mainly rolling tobacco and not straights. I started when I was 17 and I will be 22 in December. I am male by the way.

A family member quit and has smoked for 20 years, he is now 3 months in and no relapse. Can we use a word like relapse? I guess it is a drug... Anyway....

My mother also smoked for a good 15 years but she hasn't smkoed in almost 12 years now.

Anyway, it has been 5 days since my last and I am going completely cold turkey, is that the best way?

Only time I ever really, really craved a cigarette was this morning as soon as I woke up. Other than that it has been a doddle.

Does it get harder? Should I be prepared? Am I lucky? The guy i spoke to who is now 3 months clean said week 3 was torture for him.


Only thing i have noticed is an upset stomach and my legs are sensitive and my feet seem puffy? Wondering if this is a blood flow thing? Is any of that common?

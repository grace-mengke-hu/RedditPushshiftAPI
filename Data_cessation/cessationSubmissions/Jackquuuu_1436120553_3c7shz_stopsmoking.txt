When does my body get better?

I've recently stopped smoking, and don't really have cravings until I think about it. I have smoked for 3 years about 5 a day, and was wondering when I can get back to being the same level as a non smoker. I know your body start to heal right away, but I heard the risk for lung cancer to go back to being as a non smoker is 15 years. Is that true for everyone or is that number for heavy smokers. Also I'm getting dizzy and my resting bpm is changing. For example yesterday my resting bmp was 74 but now at 104.

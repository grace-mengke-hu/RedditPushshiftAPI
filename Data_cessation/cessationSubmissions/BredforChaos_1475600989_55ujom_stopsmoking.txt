Husband has been a year smoke free, he is having bad cravings/withdrawals again and we could use your help...

Hi, like I said my husband quit smoking cigarettes  around this time last year, he switched to vaping for a few months and then quit altogether. Now that the weather is getting cooler his cravings are coming back full force and is even experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. He wants to try vaping again to call the cravings but I feel that's a step backwards. 

I don't want him to suffer or feel like shit... but also don't want him to backpedal in his recovery. If you guys and gals know any tips on how he can stay smoke free... maybe something that can calm his cravings without making him nicotine dependent again, it would be greatly appreciated.

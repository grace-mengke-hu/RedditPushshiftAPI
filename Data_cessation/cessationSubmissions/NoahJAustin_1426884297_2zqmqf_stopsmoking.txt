Almost 20 days.

And some serious crap has gone down. The wife and I have fought, her Dad is real sick and probably not gonna make it much longer, there was some shit with our doctors that we now have to figure out... but through all of it I've stayed smoke-free. This has been my first serious attempt since the last time I quit (at the age of 16... I'm 30 now). I'm doing it, ya'll. Smoked since I was 12 (til 16, then back again 6 months later). If I can make addiction my bitch, you can too.

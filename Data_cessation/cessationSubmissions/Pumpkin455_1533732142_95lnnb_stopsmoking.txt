Day 8 no smoke or vape

I have been smoke free now for 2 months and vape free for 8 days. I'm in awe of you guys in this sub that have been smoke free for years. 

I've struggled slightly with anxiety since quitting, usually because when I'm anxious I smoke! This is the only downside though compared to many 'ups' and it will pass.

A few things that are helping:

1. Filling working smoke breaks by making another brew, playing a phone game. 

2. If anyone asks me to go for a smoke instead of saying 'I'm trying to quit' now I say 'I don't smoke'  I notice people don't offer them to me and I don't receive any 'how long will that last' comments. 

3. Throwing myself into new actives to keep myself occupied i.e bikerides, in return this is making me, my anxiety and my breathing feel so much better!

4. Thinking of my health and reasons for quitting!

Thanks to this sub for keeping me motivated! One day I'll get to post that I'm a year smoke free :)

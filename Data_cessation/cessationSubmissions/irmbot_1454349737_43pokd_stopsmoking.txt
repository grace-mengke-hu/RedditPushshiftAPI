TRIED to quit yesterday

So, I ended up bumming two cigs off my roommate yesterday, but I still wanna quit. I'm realizing cigarettes may be harder to quit than alcohol. So, since I don't have a pack, I was going to buy an e-cig from the smoke shop after work today. I'm a menthol smoker, any suggestions?

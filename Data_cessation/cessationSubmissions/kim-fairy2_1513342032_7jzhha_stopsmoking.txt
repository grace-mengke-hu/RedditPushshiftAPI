If you miss the little breaks, try this!

I just wanted to share this with you.. I quit for good 8 days ago and it's going great. What really helped for me was playing the game Clay Jam on my phone (Android. Not sure if it's available for iphone.) It's free btw. 

I kinda miss the breaks when I don't smoke, so it's perfect to fill those 10 minutes with playing a little game. What also helps is that in this game, if you fail the assignment you still get points. So the reward centre in your brain gets triggered every time and you get some sweet, sweet dopamine. The sounds are really satisfying as well. 

Just wanted to share this with you guys. Also, any tips for other games? Do games work for you?

Withdrawals 3 weeks after quitting?

I feel like I'm still suffering intense withdrawal symptoms but they seemed to have subsided a week ago (aside from flare-ups of anger). My stress is really intense right now, my eyes and face feel kind of clogged like sinuses (I know this is sometimes caused by quitting, also). I'm doing NoFap simultaneously and my home situation has deteriorated into a highly stressful situation and I don't know if that's triggering it more.

Is this normal?

Want to stop. Need to stop. Help!

OK... I smoked pretty regularly from the time I was 11 until ~18 when I quit for a girl.... in the next 13 years (probably 3 or 4 in) I had one cigarette and that one was a mistake... made me feel horrible or I just got sick at the same time coincidently.

Anywho. After over a decade only having had one cigarette I started again at the tail end of 2011 and pretty much went almost back to how much I was smoking before. 

I averaged from a pack and a half to three packs a day all those years ago... was at about two a day through 2012 and now down to whatever I get my hands on and bumming from friends. Usually somewhere close to a pack a day.

I kept telling myself "once I'm over this stressful event in my life I'll quit" ... well my life has only gotten worse every time I've told myself that. More stress. More anxiety. 
I realize I need to stop. I want to be there for my kids and I'm tired of making excuses to keep doing it.

I was with my kids all day Saturday. I was sick most of today and yesterday. So I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days... and It's *KILLING* me (no pun intended).. I WANT one now!

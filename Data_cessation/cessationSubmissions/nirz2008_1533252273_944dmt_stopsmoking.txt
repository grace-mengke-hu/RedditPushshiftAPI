Need help. It's been two weeks and the withdrawal symptoms are NIGHTMARE.

Chainsmoker. Used to smoke every day for about 5 years, quitting it cold turkey has made me constantly anxious. I am getting like 4-5 panic attacks, sweating, feeling hot,  scared to go out, trouble breathing, is it normal symptoms of withdrawal? Never had a history of anxiety, and didn't know that panic attacks could be such a frightening experience. 

Is it normal? 

If yes will my panic attack disappear after the withdrawal period because it has become a hell of a nightmare.

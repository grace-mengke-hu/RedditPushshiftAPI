Just started quitting cigarettes again, feeling confident for the most part, except for one small hitch...

I've quit in the past for extended periods, and my strategy has been adapting so i'm quite positive this will be *the* time.

**HOWEVER**

I've recently met this girl who is amazing, and she smokes.  We've both been through a lot this last year, and we're lucky to have found eachother for emotional support.  I mean, **really** lucky, this last year has been hell for us and without going into detail - meeting eachother is the best thing that's happened in a while.  So this (quitting smoking) is an attempt at having yet another positive experience lately.

The fact that she smokes is not what i'm worried about...

What i'm worried about, is that sometime this next week we're gonna be a little naughty and take some MDmA and have a really intense day of 'cuddling'.  We rarely take drugs anymore, but we've planned on being a little naughty and i'm still keen to go through with it.  From previous experience, cigarettes and MDmA go together like tea and water.  I want to enjoy this experience, and the sneaky voice of nicotine is telling me i won't without it.

I'm embarking on this quest regardless, but any advise to get me through it without smoking a cigarette?

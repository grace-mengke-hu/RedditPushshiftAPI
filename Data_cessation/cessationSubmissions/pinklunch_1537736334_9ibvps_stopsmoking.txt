Day 3 has been a struggle - I just want to vent.

I'm almost 30 and I've been a smoker for over a decade. I have quit once before (for two years!) while I was pregnant and nursing my son. But as soon as that was done, and my only reason not to smoke was my own health, I was right back on them. My whole pregnancy and the 7 months I breastfed, I promised myself I'd be able to smoke as soon as it would no longer be directly harmful to my kid.  

Now my kid is 6 and I'm smoking a half pack to a pack a day, depending on how shit the day was. My son hates that I smoke, which makes me feel enormous guilt. I'm sure smoking was what killed my dad and don't want to leave him young without a parent, if I can help it. 

The first two days were a piece of cake. I was sick so that make it easy. Today is an entirely different story. I'm working my regular 12 shift without smokes and it's been really hard. I usually smoke about one an hour while I'm at work. Today I rationed myself 3 in case I caved and needed one. I'm not in typically in the business of depriving myself from anything. But ten out of twelve hours down in this insanely stressful shift and I haven't given in yet. 

But my brain keeps telling me *there's no harm in just one* and I'm really worried I'll justify "rewarding" myself with one at the end of the day. 

If you've read this whole rant, thank you.

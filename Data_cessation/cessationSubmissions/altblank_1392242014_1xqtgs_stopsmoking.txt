3wks and going strong (sort of)... status check.

hey all. 10:42pm yesterday marked 3weeks since i threw my last butt on my snow-covered yard (will have to pay the piper and clean up in a couple of months' time).

it has been going well so far. more or less.

i have very minimal cravings now. most of the things that i used to do with a smoke (long drive, gas fill stops, phone call on the cellphone at home or at work, parking the car before getting in to the office, before and after minor home-improvement / car-repair projects) are now totally doable without a smoke in hand. i don't even think of grabbing a smoke in all these situations, and not smoking feels "normal", if i may use that word here.

even my first coffee of the day doesn't want a smoke anymore.

obviously there's no more nicotine in my system, even though i was a reasonably heavy smoker. i know that with spring on its way (living in minnesota does have its privileges) there are bound to be the old triggers that will rear their ugly heads sometimes. and i think i'm prepared for them.

what i haven't prepared for, are the weird smoking dreams. i've had exactly two so far, and both have been more vivid than any dream when i was on chantix. the first time, i could taste the smoke. the second time, i remember thinking that this was a bland tasteless sad thing.

and today, it's exhaustion. thoroughly tired. enough to almost make me want to go home and sleep. right. now.

of course, other than these two dreams, most of my sleep has been sort of OK. some nights have been completely screwed up though, waking up every few minutes just to see what time it was.

tl;dr: hanging on without much trouble :)

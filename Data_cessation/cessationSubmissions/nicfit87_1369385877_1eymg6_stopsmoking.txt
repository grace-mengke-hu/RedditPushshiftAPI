Goodbye Cruel Mistress

TL;DR Help me quit cold turkey. 

Okay so I have been smoking for 11 years. Unfortunately I fell in love with cigarettes orI maybe just smoking in general. 

I knew it is a nasty habit, health risks, and expensive. After 11 years I want out. I am so tired of the money wasted and the health hazards. I am young but I feel so much older. I want to breathe again. I want to be able to say fuck you cigarettes. 

I tried quitting a month ago. One day at a time. Patches first, then the gum. The patches made me feel weird and the gum is just tingly gum. I have cut down a lot but I fear if I keep up then I wont be able to divorce this bitch of an addiction. I have quit a lot of things in the past but this has got to be the worst thing I have ever tried before.

r/stopsmoking please help me out. I mean what do I do? I live in a house with my SO (ex-smoker) and 2 smokers.

After unsuccessful tries with patches and gum, I think I should just try cold turkey. Any tips? 

Edit: Smoked my last one after work.

33 hours - so far so good.

Wee, 33 hours clean!
I recently made a thread, I was longing for this "just one" cigarette. But luckily I got some great help from there to keep me on track. 
It's been fairly easy so far - at least easier that expected. 

* I decided that this was a minor thing. Just like stop drinking Cacao or something. Didn't tell no-one, and no-one noticed so far. I'm on a vacation, so I'm dreading a bit for going home in to my small apartment, that smells like cigarettes. My clothes, my bed.. Everything :( 

* And to go to work as a non-smoker.. I used to really love to take a break with a coffee and a cigarette while the others were eating.
It was my 5-minutes alone, to really take a break from the work and being social. So that's gonna be hard.. And going out for a beer with friends...

But - the **positive** sites! 
I already can feel:

* My breathing is easier - not heavy and sluggish 
* My body is warmer - my toes are actually semi warm! I used to freeze all the fucking time. 
* I sleep better 
*  I don't feel gray, and sluggish
* I don't feel ashamed of my self 
* I don't really feel the urge - and when it comes I just think "Nah, it's nothing." Then it feels like nothing.
* I don't feel the need for coffee either! 
* I don't smeeeell or taste like shit!
* I'm not sacrificing anything .. Just feeling better :) 
* I feel good, na-na-na!

Right now, I would've smoked around .. Maybe 30 cigarettes - Yuck... My boyfriend is going to love this. He's always asking me when I'm going to quit this shit. He was right.. Even though it felt like annoying nagging at the time.

**Merry Christmas guys, we can all do this!**

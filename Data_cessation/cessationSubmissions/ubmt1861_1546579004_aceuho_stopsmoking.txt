When I got busted smoking in High School some 15 years ago, my teacher told me next time I want a cigarette just try taking a deep breath.

She said that part of the reason that smoking calms people's nerves is that they are taking deep breaths. So while you may not get the nicotine or oral fixation, there is a part of smoking you can get without smoking. I've been using it these past few days, and it has been helping me a lot. 

What she said may or may not be scientifically accurate, seems to make sense and be working for one reason or another though.

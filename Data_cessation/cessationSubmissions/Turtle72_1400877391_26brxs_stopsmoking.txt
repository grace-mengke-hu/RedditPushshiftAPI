What? 8 WEEKS nicotine free! Yeah Baby!

Last night at 10pm I hit 8 weeks (56 days) smoke free.  BIGGGGG  Thanks to all of you here.  There have been touch and go moments and I have not had to give in.  Had a really REAL smoking dream last night that totally freaked me out, but it's ok.  It was just a dream.

For all of those just starting out or in the throes of addiction, you can do this if I can.

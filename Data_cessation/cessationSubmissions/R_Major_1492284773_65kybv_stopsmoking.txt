Quitting nicotine (this time, for real) Day 0-1

**Day 0-1**

Today I felt urge to finally (this time for real) quit nicotine. I used to smoke, vape and did snus for about 2-3 years. 

* I decided to write a little diary to keep me going. 
* English is not my native language.
* I'm 20 and male.

I have tried to use different kind of alternatives to stay away from regular cigarettes. Mainly because regular ones smell bad, are more expensive in long term and alternatives made me feel, that it isn't so bad, if I don't smoke regular cigarettes.

My journey started yesterday, when my pack of cigarettes came to end once again. I held that last cigarette for the end of the day, because I always enjoyed that after-work cigarette with some of my colleagues I used to smoke with. Normally I would go and buy new pack for another day, but this time I decided to try once again - to quit.

My first full day wen't well, although it was hard to stay out from smoking room. My coworkers often told me, to go smoking or something, because I was continuously working and not taking some breaks. Instead of breaking and going to buy cigarettes, I took my notebook and wrote 2017 bucket list there. First thing I wrote there, was to quit smoking. Another dream that I have had is to run marathon before 21.

I have heard, that first 3 days are the most difficult to stay out of nicotine. It's logical... because nicotine will totally be gone within 1-3 days after your last using some. Instead of smoking, I wen't down to diner to drink some tasty coffee. 

End of day 1.

Reset my badge, I caved after 111 days.

Hello,
Like many, I have really found /r/stopsmoking very useful during my last hundred day of quitting. I feel as if I need to be honest with everyone here and reset my badge as an act of defeat, to remind myself that I need to strive to stay clean of the nasty  habbit.

Last night, after a few to many drinks, I walked over to the gas station and purchased the a small black and mild cigar. I lied to myself and felt that I was finally stronger than the habit, that I could smoke a little cigar without it hurting me... I am wrong. 

This morning, I have a pretty nasty headache (maybe the guilt, maybe the alcohol), but even now I am resolute to continue to quit  even though I had a moment of weakness. 

Thanks for reading :-D

Just quit smoking. When will the incredible fatigue go away?

My badge is wrong: I only quit smoking like... almost a week ago?

Anyway, what I'm wondering is when is the fatigue going to go away? I only had issues with minor irritability for about a day or two, but every single day since we quit I've been impossibly tired all day. It starts about two hours after I wake up, and I just feel *totally* drained. I feel like I've been up for an entire day, I fall asleep while I'm watching TV, I don't feel like doing anything... it fucking sucks. 

Is there anything I can do for it without using caffeine? And when will it stop? It's the worst part of quitting. :/

This isnâ€™t my first quit, but this is the most planned and organised I have ever been.

I have always quit cold turkey, with no thought but to get through each day. This time I have spent the last few weeks planning this quit and getting ready for the journey. I just smoked my last cigarette and would love some positivity up in here!

Smoke since 16, now 31 - pack a day.

Always told myself that I would be out by 30, needless to say, the last year and a half has been many quit attempts, huge hit to my self esteem and lack of confidence has creeped into all areas of my life. I am excited to get the joy of life back. I wish everyone out there reading this that are currently quitting the best of luck, and to all smokers considering doing it, lets go on this journey together!

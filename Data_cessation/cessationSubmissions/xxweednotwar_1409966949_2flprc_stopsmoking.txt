How do I get my boyfriend to support my decision to quit?

I'm 23, been smoking for 10 years, want to quit before kids and save money, blah blah. I just want to stop, you know? 

My live in boyfriend has said he's proud of my decision but seems to be having a hard time adjusting. I've asked him to smoke outside now, just because the smell is making me sick. He has been doing well with that, but we went for a drive and he was going to smoke and since we were in my car and not his, I thought it would be okay to ask him to not smoke in my car. He got a bit frustrated which I do understand. Wanting a cigarette and not being able to have one is one of the most aggravating things. But he asked if he was able to smoke one on the way home. I asked him why he couldn't smoke one when we were at the store or that he could pull over and have one. He got so frustrated that I gave in and let him have one. And on the way home, he asked me to light one for him. I told him I didn't want to and he was upset again. 

Is it possible for one to quit and one not to? I don't want him to feel as though he has to, because quitting when you're 'not ready' is hard and usually impossible. But I do hope that by me quitting, he'll be able to quit a bit more easily when he's ready.

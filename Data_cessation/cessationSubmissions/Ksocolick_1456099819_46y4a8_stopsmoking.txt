I did not give in

My husband and I have stopped smoking. For me smoking has been about stress relief. For him it is the same but it is also about being social.
I know that he has a cigarette at work several times since we quit. That is really defeatist to me. Needless to Tay my emotions have been up and down as well as his. 
As I write this we are not speaking as nothing nice can be said by either of us right now.
My first thought was fuck this and go have a cigarette - but I didn't. This has probably been the hardest cigarette not to have but I haven't had it.

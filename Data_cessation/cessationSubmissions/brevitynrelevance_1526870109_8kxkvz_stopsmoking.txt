147 days: dreamt I relapsed and so I recommitted to my quit

Last night I dreamt I started smoking again. I was really mad at myself in my dream, but decided I would just have to quit again. I was also confused why I had started smoking again because I couldn’t remember why I’d started. 

When I woke up I was relieved to remember I’m almost 5 months in. 

At about 3 months the cravings got more intense again. Lately I’ve been alright and I don’t really think about it. Can’t wait to hit 5, then 6 months! 

Hang in there guys. Even in our dreams, we are committed to living a healthier lifestyle.

I want to quit. My dad also smokes and want to approach him about doing it together. Need help with a gameplan on how to approach it.

So I'm 31 and have been pack a day for 10 years. My father is 65 and has been pack a day for 45 years. I don't want to smoke and was thinking that this would be good opportunity to maybe try to support each other and do it together. 

I am considering that if I do it alone, he will continue to smoke and may continue his mentality that's it's easier for everyone else than it is for him. 

Maybe we could both read the Alan Carr book together and do meet ups to talk about the chapters or something in that line for starters. 

I realize that there probably have been similar discussions before so please forgive me if this is a repeat post and would appreciate any links. At the very beginning of my journey. Hoping to get him to come along too.

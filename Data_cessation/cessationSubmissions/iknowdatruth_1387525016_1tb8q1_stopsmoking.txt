It is easy for me to quit at home, but I start again every time I get back to school

It is my senior year of college, and once again I have decided to quit smoking during winter break. I've had a vicious cycle where I easily quit while I'm home, but as soon as I go back to school I pick it up again. At home I have the support of my family, lack of stress, and snowboarding to motivate me. Once I get back to school I have my smoking peer group, tons of stress, and every time I walk to class it triggers a craving. 

I really want to stick to being a non-smoker, but I know the temptation when I go back to school will be really difficult to deal with. Any advice on how to prepare myself for the transition? I think this time I have much more motivation to quit and a better understanding of my triggers and illogical justifications, so I'm confident I can do it. I'm just hoping someone else has experience with difficult transitions like going back to school and might have some tips for getting through it.

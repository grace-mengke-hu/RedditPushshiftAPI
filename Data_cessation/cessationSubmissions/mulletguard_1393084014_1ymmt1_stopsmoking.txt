How I quit smoking

I've been seriously trying to quit smoking since Jan 1st. Tried vaping, patches, cutting back etc and nothing was working. I enjoyed vaping, but I was doing nothing but adding vaping to my smoking habit. I've smoked for over 20 years. But today, I'm celebrating 2 weeks tobacco/nicotine free! Wanna know how I finally quit? Had a heart attack two weeks ago today and then a triple by pass two weeks ago this Tuesday. I have not craved a cig since that first chest pain.

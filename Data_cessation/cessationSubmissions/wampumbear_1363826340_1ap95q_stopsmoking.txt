Helping a friend quit...care package ideas? 

A very close friend of mine has taken the first few steps towards quitting and I am really proud of him. Unfortunately we don't live very close (he's about 250 miles away) and I don't get to see him often. I'd like to send him a care package to show my support and encourage him to continue fighting the good fight. I am not a smoker so I was hoping /r/stopsmoking could lend a hand on putting together a solid care package. Were there any 'go to' items (ie. food, gum, books) that you went to while at work or just out and about that helped keep your attention off cravings? He started to use these [Electronic Cigarettes](http://www.blucigs.com/) and I was thinking about getting him a couple of cartridges or a starter kit. So far, the only ideas for a care package include a card, some gum, and the Electronic Cigarettes. Any other suggestions would be awesome!

True test

I abruptly quit smoking cold turkey almost 3 months ago and I’ve been great. I haven’t touched one since then even though a lot of my close friends at work are smokers and often smoke right in front of me. It was really hard at first but I managed to get through it.

The last week-ish has been a true test though. I got into a car accident last week and the stress from it all brought me the closest I’ve been to cracking. I have final exams coming up and I work in retail so with christmas coming up and all it’s been really hectic. And I cannot get cigarettes off my mind. I’ve thought about it constantly for days now and the cravings are even more intense than they were in my first month of quitting. I used smoking so much as an emotional crutch that I feel lost without it to lean on in tough times like this. 

Anyone experience anything similar? You can really think you’re in the clear with your quit but it truly is a constant battle. Any words of encouragement will help :(

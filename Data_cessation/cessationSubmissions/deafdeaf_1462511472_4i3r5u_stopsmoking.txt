Tired of making excuses, time to find solutions.

20 years old and I just bought a pack of cigarettes and after realizing I was just standing outside, smoking, not even being relaxed by the nicotine anymore, not even enjoying the flavour, just chain smoking for the sake of chain smoking I threw the pack in the trash and told myself its time to quit.

I've been smoking since I was 15 so it's pretty built in to my stress management. The times I've been able to quit for a few months at a time are times when exercise takes the place of nicotine.

I need to find exercise that doesn't involve running or biking. I enjoy both but I can't because I'm a line cook and after working a 10 hour shift my legs are sore as hell.

I need to find some better way to cope with day to day stress.

Thanks for any advice in advance. Wish me luck.

20 days smoke free.

Just checking in. Badge says 20 days, technically it's 21. 

Still feeling pretty good. I think I've learned a lot from my many failed attempts to quit. I do remember how I felt when I quit the first time for two entire years, and I remember how it felt to relapse that time, and all of the many times after. 

But, I know I'm done this time for good. I have zero need / want to smoke anymore.

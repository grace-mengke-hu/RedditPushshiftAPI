Stoptober Day 1 I'm SMOKE FREE

Ok so I've smoked for 20years (28th Sep) in my early 30's now. I started smoking the day my cousin died, I decided on the 20th anniversary to try quit. 
I unintentionally started cutting down from July. 
I thought it would be good to do Stoptober. I've just completed my first smoke free day. It's been easier than I thought. I found the first cig of the day, after evening meal and last before bed the hardest to resist. 
I think what made it easier for me was that I had no cigarettes in the house and I purposefully haven't gone anywhere near a shop so I wouldn't be tempted to get any. 
I'm fearful that when I go shopping I'll buy a pack out of desperation...

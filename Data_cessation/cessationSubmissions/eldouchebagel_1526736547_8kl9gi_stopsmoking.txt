Day 47

I’ve been on nicotine patches for 45 days and scaled down the dosage as instructed.  Yesterday I went patch free and the cravings are a bit stronger now.  Had a dream last night about smoking and woke up thinking for a second that I would go outside and have a wake up smoke.  It was only a second before I remembered I’m a nonsmoker.   The fact that my subconscious forgot that fact concerned me.  There’s been a few moments where I feel a bit panic stricken.  I do feel that my practice in overcoming the psychological cravings first while using the patch is helping me go through now final physical withdrawals and remain strong.  The cravings so far are a bit stronger than anticipated and this last day has been harder than I thought .  Oh well 2 days to go before the nicotine is completely expelled from my body.  Wish me luck!  I’m sticking to my quit.

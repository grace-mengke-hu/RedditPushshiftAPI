First puff aged 7 now 48yrs young!!!

I was in the company of smokers today and normally that would have been my undoing, but today I had the odd moment and thought about smoking, but realised that I didn’t actually want one?!? This is a great place to find myself, all of my adult (and part of my childhood) life I never knew who I was without a cigarette and kinda thought that there was no life without one.
Turns out life simply just goes on and you are still who you are.... Errrgh is that it, this is my great eye opening, mind blowing moment!!!!!!!!
Life goes on and you are still the same person?!? 😂🙏😂🙏😂🙏

Day 34 - what worked, what didn't

I am currently on my 34th day of being a non-smoker...this is hard for me to say because I haven't been 100% . Two weeks ago, under the influence of alcohol, I smoked a cigarette with two excuses in mind:

1. If you don't remember it, it didn't  happen.
2. I was stressed, so that gave me permission.

Did I wake up feeling guilty?  Yes. Did I wish I could take it back? Yes. 

I am the type that doesn't get back on the horse, once I've been knocked down.I decided, ths situation is different.  I decided to rally and think of a game plan - what has worked so far vs. What hasn't worked. I wanted to share my successes with you guys in order to reward my accomplishments, rather than wallow in that one night. 

1. I started walking on my lunch breaks. Instead of feeling locked up in the breakroom, struggling to find something to do (a cigarette was always the answer), I have found a regular walk.  Reaching my Step Goal on my FitBit is more exciting than a cig. 
2. At first, I used to go outside with my friends or boyfriend when they wanted to smoke, again to fill in my feeling of needing something to do. I found the craving doesn't go away when you do this. I have now stopped.
3. I transfer  $1.80 daily into a "Non-Smoking Success" account to track the money I save by not smoking. 
1. I regularly take a mental note of the way I feel (i.e. not afraid to be active bc of shortness of breath, being 28 and no longer hiding things from my parents, smelling bad at work)

It may be small steps, but I am proud of making it this far. Since I was 21, I haven't considered myself a smoker, always a social smoker.  If everyone around you smokes 24/7 and you're joining them, you...are...a...smoker. It's time I take control of my health and not voluntarily throw it down the drain.

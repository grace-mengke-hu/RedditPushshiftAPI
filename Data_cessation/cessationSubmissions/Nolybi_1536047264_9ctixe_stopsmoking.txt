Advice needed - Quitting a habit

Dear Wonderful people of reddit,

I am 26 years old, bought my own pack of cigs since I was 18. I decided to quit for many reasons. One and the most important is, that I love smoking but from the bottom of my heart I hate it that it became a "need" and a habit instead of some occasional thing like having a beer with friends. Also I really worry for my health and my SO doesn't like it either.

I was never a hard smoker, always had 6-7 per day (or I felt sick) and that's it. I want to give it up so much. I don't care much about how much money it saves (I am making a decent living for what I am grateful) but more like the health concerns. 

Planning to go cold turkey monday-friday, and on the weekends have one maximum two. Do you think this "plan" is feasible? I am scared to think about never ever smoking again but I don't want this to control my life as much as it does already. I am also scared this having one or two pieces on the weekend is something my mind tells itself as an excuse, I'm not sure what to do. Also the cravings are uncanny. 

TLDR: wanna quit completely but allowing 1-2 on the weekends tops and needs reassurance

I waited....

I was all gung ho on my first post the other day on quitting right then and there instead of waiting for the date I had as my quit date.... annnnnnd I still didn't make it. Woohoo badge reset, and hopefully that's that. I'm not upset with myself really at all... I'm tackling 2 addictions at once.... I quit drinking 2 weeks ago.... I'm doing amazing at that and am very happy how strong I've been with it.... I know cigarettes, IMO, are a lot harder. It's funny tho, alcohol withdraws can actually kill you, but the smoking withraws are just on a whole different level. I feel so irritated with everything when I don't get to smoke when I want one. Ugh. I know I'm strong and I know I can do this, but fuck it's hard. I'd take a kidney stone over the withdraws, and those little bastards hurt more than child birth.

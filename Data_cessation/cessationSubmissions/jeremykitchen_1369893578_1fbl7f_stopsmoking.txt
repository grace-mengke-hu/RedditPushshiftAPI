Day 5. Can you say cravings?

Starting last night, trailing off a bit earlier and coming back strong tonight, I've been having major cravings. I've come pretty close to going to 7-11 to have just one and toss the rest of the pack, but have fortunately resisted so far. Even the first 2 days I didn't have cravings this bad.

Any advice? I've walked about 4 miles so far tonight and eaten several times, so I really don't know what else to do.

Wow, today is a really tough day.

I usually try to give lot of positive advice here. But the past two days were really hard for me and today is not much better. Do you know the days where you feel like everything is too much and nothing is working out? You just fantasise about chilling at home and smoking a whole damn pack.

Oioioi I´m have been thinking for 3 hours know about buying a pack on my way home.

I think just writing it down here helps a lot already. And I think I won´t feel any better if I relapse. I think that I would actually feel worse. But still my mind is playing any freaking trick on me. I really thought that I am over the hill and didn´t expect to have such feelings for cigaretts anymore.

Have to stay strong now!!

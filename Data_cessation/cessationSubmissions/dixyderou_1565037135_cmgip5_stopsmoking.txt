This is the last not a special one

I smoked my last one some hours ago. Not a special place or an important moment. The one I consider my last is one of my 20 cigs a day it symbolises the repetition of this bad habit. 

Into our mind we think cigs is something we like to celebrate a moment ..but it is a fake we only smoke because tabacco corporations want our money with no care about our lives, also our states love more taxes than us.

I am a DJ and last Saturday in an open air club a friend of the DJ who plays with me  passed me a joint. At the first I wanted to resist but I said in my mind "it is only a shot".. I smoked two half joints the next hour and I made my worst set ever.
I don't know what I smoked but it a wasn't regular joint ..sometimes I played stoned but not at this level.
Sunday morning it was an adventure to back home.. and it was many hours after these joints.
The day after I realized that: the other DJ is a bastard, he fear to loose his DJ job and used this trick to put me out of order.

I told you this story because of "it is only a shot" fucked my set as "it is only a cigs" let us fall back into nicotine.

When he passed me the joint I fell inside myself a sensation, I don't know how explain it ..it was like a light voice "don't do it" but I said "who cares" like when you don't smoke and you fall into nicotine again.

So now I'm fully motivated to be no more a slave of corporations or evil people ..I will be determinate to not smoke.

I want to achieve a more stronger willness and any advice from you will be appreciated.

Starting tomorrow, wish me luck!

So, am attempting (again) tomorrow morning to give up smoking. It's my third (?) attempt but I have the strongest motivation this time, and did a "dry run" earlier this week.
I know it's going to be hard, so was hoping for a few words of encouragement and maybe some pointers of what to avoid/scenarios you've been through. I'm doing dry January so my issues with drinking and succumbing to the smoke should be minimised.
Thank you in advance reddit!

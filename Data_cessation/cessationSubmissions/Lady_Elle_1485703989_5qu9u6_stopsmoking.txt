3 days.....16 hours....

This morning has been particularly tough for some reason. Another 7 hours and I'll be at 4 days without a single puff. I wake up every morning with a huge sense of accomplishment. I say to myself "Oh right, I'm not smoking anymore." Today.....today I won't even have one puff. Even in moments like this. I'll look at the list of reasons that I've quit, to remind myself that this is worth it....I'm worth it.

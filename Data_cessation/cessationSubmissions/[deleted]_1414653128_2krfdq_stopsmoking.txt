Feedback/Some Advice

I have smoked for not quite a year. There was a month I smoked a pack a day, however the majority of the time it was 4-5cigs a day. Last week I quit for a week, then started smoking 1 cig a day, though there were somedays when I don't have any. 

I do want to quit, however I am wondering how much an impact on my health 1/.5 cigs a day will have in the long term?

Pro-tip I got welbutrin for seasonal depression, killed all cravings as a side effect, prob why i can smoke 1 or less cigs a day, no nicotene high though. ever.

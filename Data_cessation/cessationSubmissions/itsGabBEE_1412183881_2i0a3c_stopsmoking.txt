I'm struggling!

Jan 2014 i stopped for a whole month...for the past 2 mnths I've been trying to get back on track but I'm struggling just after a few hours or 1 day. I found that every time I told a friend/family member I would then slip up and have a smoke, and you know you can never just have one.  I learned that expressing your accomplishments, before making true progress isnt the best idea because the brain sends of this chemical that makes us feel accomplished. But how can I not want to shout to the mountain tops my progress?

Just last month I found this sub, and I'm excited to try to stopping again as my 25th bday is approaching on the 3rd. Plus I've made other changes/goals in my life that I think will contribute to helping stop.

I hope to become very active in the sub and use the sub for my own support, and receive all those badges! 

Goodluck to us all with this terribly terrifying but rewarding goal to stop smoking. We can all do it!

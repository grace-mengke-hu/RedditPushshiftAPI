Drugged and possibly raped, my 5 month quit in danger

Im at 5 months today. Bought a pack yesterday.

I recently found out that I definately got drugged in januari and have an std now. A minor one for which I've taken pills. But I guess someone drugged me and had sex with me that day.

I was in denial since the 15th of januari, but since I got the std results i've been restless. Trying to figure out what happend. A friend of mine who was at the party and lost track of me that day is coming over today and I'll need to ask him some though questions. Maybe he knows a bit more as the others present were his teammates.

My dad had picked me up that day and all signs lead to GHB, a drug of which i had no knowledge prior.

There's a lot of evidence, but no hard proof so the police are unable to help.

Now my 5 month quit is in danger and I'm terified of becoming a smoker again. Smoked 2 yesterday and 1 just now. I've been in constant fear of what could have possibly happend, unable to get it of my mind. Going out for nicotine candies now, hoping it will stop me from lighting another sig.

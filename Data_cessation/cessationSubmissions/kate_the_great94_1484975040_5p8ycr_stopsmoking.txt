Why it's hard

I've been trying to quit smoking for almost 2 years now, I'm 22 and I've been smoking on and off since I was 16 and pretty consistently for a year and a half. I'm really good on my days off, usually going 3 or 4 days without a smoke but, I work as a cocktail waitress in a casino. The combination of smelling the temptation all day along with the stress of the job usually means I cave. It's not like I have a pack a day habit but I just need advice on how to quit once and for all.

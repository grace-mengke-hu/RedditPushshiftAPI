65 days. A tip for people trying to quite.

People read Allen carr' book Easy way to quite smoking.  I've been seeing a lot of post and not many have mention allen carr's book.  Look his name up and get it and read.  Its amazing how much it helps.  I was a person who con't get passed 1 day cold turkey.  Tried the E cig just made me go back to smoking.  The patch is crap.  This is all my opinion and has worked for me.  Just to say bc some might jump down my throat.

Five years of smoking exactly today, time to quit.

I started smoking five years ago on October 5th. I was thirteen, and now I'm a pack a day smoker. I went to have a cigarette this morning and couldn't think of anything more horrendous than a cigarette; I didn't smoke it. I'm four hours into quitting, turned down a few chances to smoke. This is incredibly difficult, but if I can make it to tomorrow, then I know I can quit.

I bought a pack last night!

And smoked three cigarettes in a row, and then decided I made the right decision to stop. I threw the rest away, ripping each cigarette up as I did.

I was drinking when I bought the pack, and was thinking back to the glory days of binge drinking and smoking entire packs of cigarettes, and, I don't know, thought it was appealing to relive. 

Even after three cigarettes I'm wheezing the next morning. It's amazing that I ever went 8 years as a smoker! 

The bad: I piqued the addiction, so I will have to deal with that. Being the next morning, I would have expected to be pining for a cigarette but I feel the same as the day before, when I'd been stopped for a week. My lungs feel like shit.

The good: I stopped, and it was easy. I feel like I reinforced the decision to stop. I didn't keep smoking like every time I've caved in before! It's a good feeling.

To anyone questioning if they made the right decision... you did. It's a terrible shit poison that ruins your lungs, and you pay for the privilege. 

**You're doing the right thing!**

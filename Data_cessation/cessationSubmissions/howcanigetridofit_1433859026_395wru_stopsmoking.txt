Look who's back

I dropped the ball last time, but I'm quitting again, starting today.

Why today? Because I'm bored and I have a lot to do. It sounds like a contradiction, but so does smoking - I smoked because I was bored and because I had a lot to do.

So today I'll be running errands and resenting it, but I'll be smoke-free while I do this, which makes it just a little bit better.

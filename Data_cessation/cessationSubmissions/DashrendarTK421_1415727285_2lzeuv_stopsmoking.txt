Today is my last day.

I've been quit for about a month now, but have still been bumming off people and made the mistake of buying a pack last Friday. I've still got the pack, but I am so over this that I am about to just set it on fire. I'm 27 and have been a pack a day or more smoker since about 14. To all the other quitters on here, thank you for inspiring me to finally just say fuck it, I'm done.

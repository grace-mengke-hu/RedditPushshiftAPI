Rash due to nicotine gum

On another quit.  I've started to develop some red bumps around my eyes.  The last time I had this rash was last year when I tried to quit smoking and was chewing the gum.  I am thinking it is some sort of reaction to the nicotine gum.  I've found others on reddit that described a similar rash but none of them linked it to the gum.  I'm just curious if anyone else experienced this.  I've done a week on the 4mg dose, now I'm stepping it down to 2mg for a week, then I plan on quitting the gum.  (the last time I quit smoking I think I stayed on the gum too long, this time I want to get off it sooner).  I guess I will just deal with it until I'm off the gum, but was curious if I was the only one that had this reaction.

My 8 year old made me cry

My 8 year old was my inspiration to stop smoking, she would get very upset and tell me she didnt want me to die. 
This morning before school she gave me a hug and said "I am so proud of you mam, I know its hard but I think you are amazing for stopping smoking". Then she gave me another hug and said "it much nicer to hug you now you dont smell like dirty cigarettes". 
I cried when she left.

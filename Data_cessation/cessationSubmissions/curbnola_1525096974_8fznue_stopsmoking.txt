How bad will withdrawals be if I've only been smoking for two months?

So basically I started smoking on my semester abroad. I know how stupid it is, but I'm in a country where smoking has literally zero stigma and I was just trying to have a good time. 

I'm not up to smoking everyday, about a pack and a half a week. I really need to stop now before it gets totally out of hand, and I know that nicotine withdrawals can be a bitch. How bad do you think it would be after smoking for this amount of time? I know it'll likely be bad, but I'm curious. 

Also I've been a lurker here a while and have seen an app mentioned that some people have used to quit. Do you know what I'm talking about? I also own a vape and am wondering how effective that can be to help quit. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

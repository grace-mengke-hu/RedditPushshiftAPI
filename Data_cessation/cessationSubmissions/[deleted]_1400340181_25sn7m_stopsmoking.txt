After 7months of being smoke-free, boyfriend smoked 5 sticks last night

My boyfriend's been clean for about 7months now. So my boyfriend went clubbing last night with his friends. He smoked 4-5 sticks then. The next day we met up and he confessed me towards the end of the day. I felt disappointed and I was also worried that he might get back into the habit. He was annoyed that I was worried for him. He later told me that I shouldn't be worried because he'll be careful. I don't know if I should say anything to show that I support him. I don't want him to use last night's incident as an excuse to pick up the habit or even do something similar when he goes out clubbing again. What should I do?

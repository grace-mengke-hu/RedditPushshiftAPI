Vaping

On Thanksgiving day 2015 I stopped smoking cigarettes, and started to vape. On April 2 2018, I am stopping the vaping. It has gotten out of control. 

I vape WAY more than I used to smoke (A pack a day). I hit my vaporizer at every single opportunity that I get, and I'M TIRED OF IT! I don't WANT to vape. I just do. I feel like it's out of my control, and I WANT CONTROL!! 

Not to mention that I always feel like my sinuses are clogged and my chest is always heavy. I'm just done, man. I know posts like this are probably a dime-a-dozen around here, but I'm not mentioning this to anyone in my life and I have to get my feelings out.

I am committed to stopping. I'm going to give it away today, and I know i'm going to have some bad cravings... What do I do people? Do I chew gum? I am sort of a nervous and anxious person... Please everyone, give me advice... I am desperate.

6 days, 5 hours, 16 minutes

That's how far along I was 15 minutes ago.

Then for some stupid reason, I bummed one off someone coming back from making groceries and, well... I just fucked everything up. Again.

My friends call me a serial quitter. I've smoked on and off for 18 years. Quit for 3 years once. Another time for 2 years. Many times for anywhere from 2 weeks to a couple of months.

Tried the patches. Tried cold turkey. I just want to quit for good, I want to go back to that feeling of not needing to smoke (which for me comes after a month or so) and NEVER HAVE JUST ONE AGAIN.

I know I'm rambling, but I guess... I've been thinking about quitting forever for a couple of months now and I just... did it. I didn't prepare myself or anything, I did download an app but that was almost 24 hours INTO my quit. Do yall think it's important to actually prepare one self? If so, what are those preparations? Does having ONE cigarette means I have screwed everything up and am going to have 3 hellish days all over again?

Thanks for reading, and any answers yall might have!

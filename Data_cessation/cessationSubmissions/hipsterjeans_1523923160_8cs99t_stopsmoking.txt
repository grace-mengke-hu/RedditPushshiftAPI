Quit Day

Hi everyone, today is the day I stop smoking cigarettes. I'm 21 years old and I've been smoking since I was 14 on and off. I got into it by hanging with the wrong crowd as a kid and I thought it made me look cool. I always said I wouldn't get addicted and that I could stop whenever I wanted but that wasn't the case. I wasn't strong enough and I don't think anyone is when it comes to addiction. It's been 19 hours since my last cigarette and I feel great. I haven't quit nicotine because I have my vape, but I'm done with the cancer sticks. 
It has affected the way I look and I miss being able to run without getting so winded. I'm hoping that I'll be able to gain some weight after a few weeks. I'm not a very big guy and they have definitely made sure I stay that way. 
I'd smoke when I was stressed, when I was sad, and when I was in social situations. All of those scenarios are basically my day to day haha. But I'm ready to be done and I hope I can keep it up. If anyone needs to talk or anything feel free to leave a comment or dm. Good luck everyone.

I quit smoking about 1 month ago. I'm now struggling with intense cravings due to my cousin, a smoker, having moved in! Help?!

Some advice/tips on how to deal with this would be good!

A little backstory - I'm a typical boomerang child, lived out for 5 years whilst at uni, moved back home a month ago. During my time away, I became a smoker and the amount I smoked tended to peak with stress. Decided that as my parents never found out that I was a regular smoker and wouldn't be happy with me smoking in their home, it was time to quit. I went "cold turkey" and luckily haven't relapsed and the cravings weren't too bad.

Now my cousin has come to stay with us for a month or so and she's a smoker. Her room stinks of it - room next to mine - and my parents trying to be nice to their niece are allowing her to smoke downstairs. 

It's making this difficult for me and as they never knew, I'd rather not tell them....

So how can I strengthen my resolve/ignore the cravings?!

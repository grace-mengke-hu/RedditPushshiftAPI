New Year's Class of 2015, we did it!

Not even one puff for me. Now I know I can do anything I set my mind to do... 

No vaping, no medical funky smoke, no gum, no patches.
I'm breathing like a champ. Exercising. Got a dog who loves to take long walks, I'm just so happy. 

I wish all of this for you 2016 NY resolutioners.
This sub does work.

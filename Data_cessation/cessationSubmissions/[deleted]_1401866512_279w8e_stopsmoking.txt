Tonight sets the clock.

I've been smoking for over 10 years.

Have relapsed over a thousand times.

Let's make this day our last day succumbing to this terrible vice.

I hope to contribute in the coming days, weeks, months on this forum.  

If you have a favorite spot that you pick up a pack after work, school, etc.  Take an alternate route.


It's time in our lives to take an alternate route and take a breath of fresh air.

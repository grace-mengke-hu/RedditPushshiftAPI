I’m done

I quit smoking cold turkey a while ago but gradually started smoking again. Maybe 2-3 cigarettes per week. Sometimes more, if I was out for drinks. Like a couple of weeks ago when I am pretty sure I smoked a whole pack in a night. 

These past couple of weeks I’ve had the most horrible pain from untreated pneumonia and I swore I will never smoke again. I’m sure I would have been healed by now if I didn’t smoke that much. Or at all. 

Crying in fetal position on the bathroom floor while coughing my lungs out for several days made me say it: I am done. Never going back.

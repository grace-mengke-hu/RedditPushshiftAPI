Husband went cold turkey on me and now I'm afraid..

So, Hubs and I have been talking about quitting. He's turning 40 soon and I'll be 41 in a few weeks. Two days ago he quit. Just decided that he wasn't going to open the next pack and just stopped. He works away from home and will be back in a week. I also want to quit but feel a bit ambushed. I have no plan in place other than "don't light the next one". I'm trying but have only been able to reduce the number of smokes I've had, not quit. What I'm most afraid of is that he'll come home before I've quit and *I* will be the one to lead him back to the smoking. I have one week to pull this off for both of our sakes. Please, any advice? I'm feeling kinda scared and also responsible for *both* of us staying away from smoking. Thanks for reading. Please cross fingers for me :)

EDIT: I'm reading Carr. You guys really know how to drive a point lol Husband read it last night and is enthusiastic about me reading it. You guys are great. Thank you for all your support and encouragement. :)

Day 15

The want/cravings haven't stopped yet, but I'm not worried about that as much as my chest heaviness and occasional left side pain. I know the doctors is where I should be, but I don't have health insurance and I want to make sure this isn't just quitting smoking related. Anyone else have had these problems. I've just started coughing up flem.

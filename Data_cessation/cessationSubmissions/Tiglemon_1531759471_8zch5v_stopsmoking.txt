Im at 55 days and have a strong urge to lite up. When I get high.

I can hear myself go, ugh it's just one it's okay. It's the same thing I fell into every-time I stopped smoking before. 

I am having a drink and was discussing  business with my partner, it's been awhile this routine. As we often did this while smoking and smoking up. 

Since I've quit smoking now we stopped this for awhile, things were a bit bitter but we've been in business together for far too long and we got each other through and through. 

I'm not sure if I can smoke up though as I tend to have alot of cigarettes after, if I do smoke up it has to be without the nicotine, I guess? Anyone done this? any suggestions will help. I'm fine giving it up as well. 

I've been having a drink in the evenings well we all need something to losen our inhibitions. But Even a drink gives me a craving especially following the older routine. I have to change it up. If I'm by myself I don't feel like smoking only when I'm around other smokers.

I believe/think I have an addictive nature, nicotine has to be out of it. Drinks is fine as I don't have  too much, and I Know myself on it. The thing with pot is after awhile I get paranoid and don't know what is real and what's imagined. Guess even drinking too much will/can do that if it does not knock me out first :D but the past I drank too much was when I was in my teens. 

Anyways I guess this post helped me think it through I'm feeling better now... About not smoking. Also, I still can use suggestions about the weed. Anyone who quit smoking continue on this with vape? I've never done it clean so it may blow my brains out : D

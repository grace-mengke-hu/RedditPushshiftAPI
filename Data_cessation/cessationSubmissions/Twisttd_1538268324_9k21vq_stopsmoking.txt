Chiantix?

New here!

Like many of you, I’ve tried quitting many times. I have tried to curb with gums, lozenges, patches (worked best), but I always come back. Has anyone had experience with Chiantix or something similar? I have a two-year-old with another coming soon, so I don’t want the symptoms to create an even wilder environment than what’s already here. 

I will try this book everyone’s talking about, but some heads up on what to expect with meds will be greatly appreciated.

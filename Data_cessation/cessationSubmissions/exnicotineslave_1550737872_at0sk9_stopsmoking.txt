Nicotine hasnt fully left my body yet but im already getting great benefits.

17 years of smoking HEAVY - not past the 72hour mark yet, but already:

• My smell is returning - (my dog needs a bath and so does my house lol)  
• My appetite is better  
• My resting heart rate has gone from 84bpm to 60bpm  
• My breathing is already better

I also stopped smoking weed and caffeine at the same time (all daily habits).

I found a way to beat my cravings this time. If it becomes too overwhelming, then I have a cigarette rolled up out of rubbed mint. Ive had 3 in total. Might sound weird but its working for me. I'm not going to replace the habit with mint but its helping me to get through the initial stages. Im just talking about the mint (herb) you buy off the supermarket shelf that you use on food. No nicotine, doesn't taste great, but its working so that's all I care about!

Starting to get excited about this instead of anxious. Its great. I know im done this time.

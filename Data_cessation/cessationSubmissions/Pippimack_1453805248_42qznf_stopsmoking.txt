Dreaming about smoking.

Over a month in and my addict brain is really going nuts on me. I'm writing this here because this sub has been so amazingly useful to me - every time my smoker-brain tries to trick me into smoking again, you guys are always there to help out.

I had a dream last night in which I was going through someone's pockets to find cigarettes. I found the cigarettes but was going to wait until everyone had left the house before I smoked it. I remember the feeling of having decided to smoke - to give up on this whole quitting thing. Even before I'd lit the cigarette, I knew I had lapsed because I had decided that I was going to smoke - and not just one cigarette: I had decided to restart.

It was a useful dream because it reminded me of that feeling of deciding to start again. Hopefully it'll help me recognise the feeling in the future and I can formulate a plan against it now.

However, the more sinister thing was this: I woke up feeling like I had started smoking again. I was disappointed in myself but simply resigned to being a smoker forever. Then I realised it was just a dream and it was a great relief... but somewhere in my head my brain is scheming against me, trying to normalise the idea that I smoke again.

I understand this is probably a weird one and perhaps it's hard to identify with... But how does everyone else feel when you dream about smoking and then wake up?

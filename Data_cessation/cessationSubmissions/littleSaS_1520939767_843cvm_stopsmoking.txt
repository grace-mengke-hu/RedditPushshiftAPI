I'm celebrating a year of being a non-smoker in ten days.

Since I quit, I've saved over $5000. 

It seems incredible that I used to spend that much for the privilege of poisoning myself, but I did. I believed it would be sooo hard to quit and that it would take me several attempts to quit, but all I really had to do was stop doing it, and stop letting it have so much control of my life. 

Now to figure out a worthy gift to commemorate this momentous occasion. Running gear, cycling gear, kayaking gear, or...?

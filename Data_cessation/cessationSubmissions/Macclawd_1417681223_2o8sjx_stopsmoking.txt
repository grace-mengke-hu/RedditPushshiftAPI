100 :)

I'm here because I achieve the 3 digits and in order to share my experience so far.

1) I can't be more happy with my decision, it's awesome to be a non-smoker.

2) After a while it's incredible easy, you just forget about nicotine and need very few will power to keep as non-smoker.

3) I didn't avoid my triggers, I hanged up with smoker friends, drank a lot but still not smoke, I just give up with the cigarettes not with my life.

I would also thank you guys this site and the badge as a remember of how far did I come really help :).

Thanks!!!!!

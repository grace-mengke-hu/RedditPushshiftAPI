My first big challenge

We don't have a lot of smokers in my town... so I haven't really seen anyone smoke since I quit (thankfully).

We went to the zoo in the next big town over and ...well... I figured the temptation would BE there, ya know? 

I watched people smoke with a great fascination and felt completely disconnected to them. 

My husband, who is vaping, vaped an absurd amount (when we're home, he is only allowed to vape outside due to previous quits him being stuck to the thing). He mentioned if it had not had his e-cig he would have gone to ask for a smoke. 

It confirms to me the right decision I made to quit cold turkey...

It empowered me. 

I felt free for the first time in a long, long time. 

I didn't even think about smoking unless passing the smoking sections which was remarkable for me :) 

Sorry for the long post but had to share <3

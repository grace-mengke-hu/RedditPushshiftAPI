Ive been smoking half my existance and I'm only 25. #StartOfAJourney

I started smoking when I was 13, never stopped since. I'm currently smoking 1.5-2.5 packs a day, depends how my day goes. Everything I do is associated with cigarretes, and I hate it. I am a slave to nicotine, and I somehow enjoy it. But today, is the day I finally quit smoking. I said I enjoy smoking, but like most of you know, that enoyment only comes from the boiling craving that nicotine produces in your system. If you dislocate your shoulder, it is going to hurt, and once a doctor manages to put it back in it's place, you are going to feel releaf. However, that releaf only exists because of the pain. I don't want to be enslaved or in pain anymore. I want to taste freedom, today is the day.   


Wish me luck!  
Any tips appreciated.

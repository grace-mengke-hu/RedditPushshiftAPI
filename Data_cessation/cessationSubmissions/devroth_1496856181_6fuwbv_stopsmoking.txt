If you fail quitting a few times, try an electronic cigarette. 90 days with lowering nicotine and today is day 3 of zero nicotine and I'm barely using it.

I failed quitting smoking like ten times. I smoked from age 15-27 (12 years) and most of them a pack a day- two if I was out drinking. After failing to quit over ten times, I decided to give vaping a try. I started at 8mg nicotine and each time I bought new juice I went down a mg. Today is my 3rd day vaping without nicotine and I'm barely using it. Every time I lowered it I found myself feeling mild withdrawal effects but they were much manageable then when I tried to quit cold turkey.

day 25 and struggling

my professional life and my marriage are both kinda kicking me in the balls right now. I know smoking won't make it any better but it's all i can fucking think apbout right now. I thought it would be a little easier by now but the world is plumb ugly to me at the moment. 

someone talk some sense into me please.

Day Two, First day back at work... ðŸ˜¬

Myself and my wife made it our New Years resolution to quit smoking. We have a few (non health related reasons) on why we wanted to stop. The primary one being that a week or so ago our 5 year old said he wanted to smoke with us. Heâ€™s always been good and knows itâ€™s a adult thing but this was the first time itâ€™s really hit home.

So yesterday was a breeze to do as I spent the day at home with my Wife and son (we never smoked in the house even in a storm we went outside)

Today however was my first day back and it was a lot harder. See Iâ€™m a builder but on residential homes not building sites, mainly in Gardens so I can stop and have a cigarette whenever I want without having to worry about leaving. My desk. My labourer is also a smoker so being around him was tough. But a good thing I discovered today which I never really knew was how much it stinks. Sat next to my labourer in the van after he had just had a cigarette really surprised me how much it smelt. Made me feel kinda disgusted that Iâ€™ve picked up my Son smelling like that.

Anyways. Day 3 tomorrow ðŸ˜¬

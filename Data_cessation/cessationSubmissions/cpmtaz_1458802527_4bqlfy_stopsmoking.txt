Over 7 mos smoke free and starting to have persistent annoying cravings...

Hi everyone! 
I'm a little more stressed lately and the idea of smoking a cigarette keeps presenting itself to me. I don't want a puff, but it smells good to me sometimes and the idea of it is ... wonderful. Perhaps I kind of miss it. 
...Help!

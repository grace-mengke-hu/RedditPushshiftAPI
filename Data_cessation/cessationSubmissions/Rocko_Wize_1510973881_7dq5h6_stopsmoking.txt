How do you guys feel about vaping?

So I've be smoke-free for about two weeks now, after smoking for about 8 years. In terms of energy and overall happiness I feel surprisingly good! I'm even getting more consistent sleep with better dreams than I've had for some reason. The only issue I've come across is that I will occasionally have random migraines that will last briefly (about 5-10 minutes), but will be extremely painful. From what I understand, this might be due to nicotine withdraw. I've been considering getting a small vape to try and ween myself off of nicotine and hopefully reduce my physical dependence on nicotine. I've heard of people who gradually ween themselves off doing this by using E-liquid with lower and lower nicotine amounts every time they refill. What do you guys think? Does this sound like a practical method, or are there better ways to treat this?

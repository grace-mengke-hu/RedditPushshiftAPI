Scary Night....

OH MY GOD. That was one tough night. Had my first night out since I started my final quit. I was fine for the first 30mins then the cravings took over - near enough ruined my night cos it's all I could think of. Only one of my friends was smoking so went outside with her when she lit up  - huge thanks Beth for not offering me one and told me I was doing well. Considered sneaking off to the shop to buy some but fortunately didn't. I'd near enough convinced myself that one wouldn't hurt - which is crap of course 1 would hurt.  Now I'm back home I'm feeling so pleased that I didn't succumb to my urges. I know now that it's still a bit too dangerous to go out drinking so early into my quit. That being said I survived and I'm still smoke free.

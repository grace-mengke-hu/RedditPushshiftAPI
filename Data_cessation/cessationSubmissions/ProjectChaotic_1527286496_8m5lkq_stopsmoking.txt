Using a replacement??

Hi guys, i tryed to stop smoking very often, but now i am 4 days smoke free(yeah). But i am using a e-cig with 3mg nic in it. What do you think about that? Someday i want to smoke only 0mg e-cigs and than quit this completly. Got anybody experience with that? Should i quit now with e-cigs too?

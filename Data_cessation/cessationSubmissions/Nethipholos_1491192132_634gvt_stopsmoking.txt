Broke down within the first 24 hrs and had one cigarette. Havent had one since.

It's been just under 4 days since my last cigarette, 5 days since i said enough was enough. The day after i quit i was at work and feigning super hard. (stressful day at work as well didnt help anything either) i ended up bumming a smoke from a coworker. That was my last cigarette so far..

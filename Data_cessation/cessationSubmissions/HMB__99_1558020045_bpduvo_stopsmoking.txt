I need help!

Alright lads, so I’ve been smoking on/off for a good 8 years now and I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve tried to quit. I’ve used gums, patches, mouth sprays, everything. I even spent £37 on a vape which did help for a while but I just can’t seem to drop the cigarettes.
I’ve weened myself off them slowly many times but I can’t resist the temptation.
Help a girl out with some advice? X

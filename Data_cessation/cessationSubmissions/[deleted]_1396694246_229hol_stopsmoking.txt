Day 69 and real belief!

Was going to wait until day 100 to start celebrating but I have now stopped using any nicotine replacement whatsoever and feel great. Since it's day 69... http://i.imgur.com/Zbs6vsq.jpg

From smoking 10 cigarettes a day for 5 years to zero. I managed to quit with the NHS (sorry non-Englandites). The ease of it was that I saw a doctor every week, where he would top you off with nicotine replacement (gum/patches/inhilator.. whatever you prefer really) and would keep you motivated to quit. 
It's good because he was a really nice guy so you just didn't want to disappoint him. Also, you can talk to him about anything smoking related and he will listen and tell you if it's normal, unlike some friends I used to talk to about quitting but they were still smokers and hated the topic of conversation. 
Now I have real belief that I will not start smoking again. I have seen a lot of posts recently that people over 365 days have decided to have one cigarette for old times sake and got back into the habit. So just one more cigarette is never a good thing.

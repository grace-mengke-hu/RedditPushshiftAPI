A tough week but I'm holding strong!

8 days, no cheats!!! I can't believe I made it through cross country travel, my first non-smoking weekend spent being the only single person at a wedding (and danced my ass off), and I'm still firmly planted on the wagon! Last night I even spent a couple hours on a porch with friends who smoke, just drinking and watching them chain-smoke, and I'm here to tell you it was not easy. I have been eating WAY TOO MUCH in the last few days (came home after midnight last night and downed a bunch of chicken wings, I am not proud). I'm exhausted constantly. I'm a little irritable. But goddammit I'm quitting smoking.

30 hours in.

I have been a heavy smoker for almost 10 years now. Decided to quit yesterday morning for personal reasons. Everything was normal yesterday but I am not being able to concentrate on work since this morning. Also, I have downed almost 4 litres of water today and it's only 1:30 pm. My usual water intake by noon is not more than 2 l. Is this normal?

What are the things you tell yourslef when the craving gets cruelly bad?

4th day for me now, and the fisrt time drinking after quitting. My brain has now convinced me that I do LOVE smoking, that I need it, that it tastes better than anything and that I can never truly get rid of these crabings. I don't even need nicotine, I just need something to do with my hands while I stand outsie. It's ridicilous, and I won't smoke, it's just my brains kidding with me.

I keep telling myself that I want to quit. That 10 years from now, I want to congratulate myself for being smoke-free for 10 years. I tell myself that smokers are disgusting and I just don't want to be one of them anymore. They're my enemies - tempting, but not on my side! What are your mantras when it gets hard to stay smoke-free?

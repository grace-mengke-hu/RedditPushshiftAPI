Any advice for this scenario?

I quit for 16 hours.....and then i was faced with the devil. My mates packet of cigarettes humbly offered to me. I didn’t win this time, but I’ve instantly restarted. Any tips for controlling the immediate, irrational “i would die for a cigarette” craving? Any help is appreciated. And i live in a household of smokers, so it is inevitable I’ll be around it.

I'm quitting for my daughter

I told my wife that I would quit smoking the day we found out we were pregnant with our first child.  Well... She's due in 4 months and I haven't held up my end of the bargain.  That is now going to change.  I'm on day 4 after smoking for 13+ years.  I can do this... I WANT to do this, for my wife, my daughter, and myself.  

I'm glad I found this place to come to get all the advice from you all.  Thank you!

Just to clarify - I never smoked around my wife since she has been pregnant.  I know how bad it is for my health, let alone a pregnant woman and unborn child.

Nicotine Patch Recommendations for a co-worker

Hi r/stopsmoking!

I have a co-worker/friend who is soon going to be flying to Italy. She will be on a long international flight and I thought it would be helpful to get her some nicotine patches (and also hoping this helps her quit in the long run). From what I have found out, she smokes a pack of Pall Mall cigarettes a day.

In addition, if you can provide any ideas of how I could help transition her to quit after she tries the patch, it would be much appreciated.

Thank You!

Day 5 . Mixed emotions/urges?

I've been smoking for the past 2 years. After my first shroom trip, I realized I needed to stop, because in the long run it's not going to workout the way I want it to if I keep this up - premature aging, lack of ambition, apathy. 

I don't have any jitters or sensational cravings for a cig. The last 5 days were pretty chill. However, I feel like I want to just go and smoke ONE just because I'm bored. 

I can easily bum it from someone, but that just leads me back to thinking about how bad my skin would look or how shitty I would feel after smoking it. 

Crazy substance, nicotine. No wonder they come in packs of 20 and not singles....

What app do you use for counting the days?

With your help I've been smoke free since 9-16-13. Thank you. I wasn't counting til today. I had to look back and find a message to find the date I quit. It helped me last time to know how many days I had been quit, how much money I had saved and other things. I poked around Play and there are hundreds. 

Qny suggestions?

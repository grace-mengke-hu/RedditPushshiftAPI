Joined reddit just for this

Going to quit today.  Tried before a few times but the motivation wasnt there.  My wife signed me up for a 10k run this May and I am just realising how daunting that is for my poor tar infused lungs.  Been a smoker for eight years now and the thought of quitting is a bit daunting.  Ive always been one to give myself future "quit dates" which was in all honesty just an attempt to make it so I didn't have to quit then and there.  I've tried patches and gum but they felt more like a crutch to get me through until I started smoking again.  Gonna go cold turkey this time with a little help from reddit!

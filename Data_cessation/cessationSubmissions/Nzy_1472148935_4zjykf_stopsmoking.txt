Quitting while smoking weed?

So, I'm 27, I've smoked weed for about 4 years, on and off.  Sometimes I'd smoke every night for months, sometimes I'd have a month off.

Since I started at this new job about 2 years ago I started smoking cigarettes as a way to do something different in the middle of my shitty day.  Now I smoke about 10 a day.

I've found that I enjoy smoking weed much more when it is with tobacco.  I want to quit smoking tobacco though, but not weed.  I feel like I get more out of weed than it takes out of me, but definitely don't like what this nicotine addiction has done to me.

Is it possible to quit tobacco while still smoking weed now and again?  Thoughts?

Also, fuck this habit.

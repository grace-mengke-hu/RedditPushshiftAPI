When exactly do mental cravings stop?

Smoked 12 yrs. Pack a day, or more on sleepless nights. Longest time without smoking 1 month. I remember having felt much better phys. after stopping but never had peace mentally. So longer than 30 days to be sure.

I've dreamed about smoking at that time, my face and ears would perk to the smell of a strangers cigarette as if I was a dog on a hunt, and while craving moved from a constant from the first week or two to an occasional gut punch at the end of the month they never stopped.

Do the cravings ever stop? Or do they just progressively lessen until they are something akin to an itchy finger and you can logically/painlessly decide a blender is not the tool to scratch it?

On day 3 now, not feeling great,hacking/feverish/cold almost huffing my dirty laundry sometimes for a sense of something familiar,comforting. Talking myself down a bit,wanting to go buy some, as I know 1 month isn't freedom day, is it 2,3,12? (what the hell to look forward to as I know 1 month is trash aside from better sense of health, con:rage,insanity)

Day 2 of No Smoking

For the past month or so, I've been tapering my smoking. I went all the way down to one per day for a week, and that week ended yesterday, 12/19/2015.   
I feel like my withdrawal symptoms could be a lot worse. I'm pretty irritable, but my headaches aren't too bad. Then again, I'm only two days in.    
Wish me luck!

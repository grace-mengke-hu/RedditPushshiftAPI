Depression and irritability

I'm normally one of the most level-headed people I know. But now, almost 2 weeks smoke free I'm noticing these random bouts of depression and irritability. It's not a surprise that it's happening it's just a foreign feeling for me. I've been going to the gym every day to try and take my mind off things. My roomates smoking still doesn't help my mood in the slightest. What do you guys do to combat this.?

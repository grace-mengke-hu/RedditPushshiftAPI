Two drags in the past two days and i think i may use my current circumstances to stop.

I have been smoking for 4 years now (25), nearly a pack a day. Over the weekend I had a drinking binge and after waking up on sunday for a cigerette got sick. Just this morning i got weak, went to the local store and bought a pack. Took a single drag and felt sick almost instantly. I'm feeling i should take advantage of this, but would like a little help from the community. My problem with quitting in the past has been stress and right now i am not lacking in that department. The union is fighting with owners who are threatening to fold the company, my relationship is long distance and can be very stressful while we work things out, and there is more on top of that. What i am asking is how am i going to deal with the stress when it starts really getting to me? How do i take my late night drive to relax myself and not light one up in the car? Whatever help you can give is greatly appreciated and honestly, writing this is kind of soothing within itself.

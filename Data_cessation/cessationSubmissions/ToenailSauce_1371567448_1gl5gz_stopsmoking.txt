1 month along...

my thoughts on the process so far.

so originally I was going to try chantix to quit because I didn't want it to be hard like the last times that I quit, so I went to my doctor and asked for a prescription and he basically said it's a waste of time, if you want to quit and stay quit you need to do it for yourself the hard way.

I was quite pissed off initially but then got to thinking about it and it makes sense. I decided the only thing holding me back was my will power and that could be strengthened by truly believing that I quit smoking and enjoying being finished with that part of my life.

I had a couple of cravings over the first two days and I used thrive gum for those, then after that the cravings subsided and if they happened I barely noticed them and they passed quickly. 

The big test was a week after I quit with a trip out to the bar with a bunch of friends who smoke, I knew when I didn't want to smoke then that I would be just fine.

Some positives that I have noticed:
mood improvement overall, lung capacity is much better (I work out frequently so I noticed this right away), skin looks healthier, I DON'T STINK LIKE SMOKE, I have extra money that I am not used to having.

Some of the not so great things:
none. (well actually I did gain a little weight initially but that is under control now)

stay strong everybody!

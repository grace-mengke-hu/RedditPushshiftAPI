Meh. Might as well, I suppose.

I have wanted to quit for a long time now, but just never worked up the motivation to do so.

Here's the thing: ~~I really enjoy smoking.~~ 

~~I know what you guys are going to say. But I really like it, even if the feeling is fleeting.~~

**(EDIT: Never mind. Watched the Allen Carr video. I guess I never truly enjoyed smoking, after all)**

So, why am I here? Let me give you a little bit background first:

- I started smoking about 10 years ago

- It was a Halloween joke: We didn't have costumes to a costume party; so, we went as smokers

- It went from one a day to two, then three, then four... eventually, it got to about half a pack a day. When I'm out drinking, it can even approach a whole pack. But about half a pack a day on average

- I'm super lazy. Sometimes, I would forget to smoke for a day or two. I forget about eating, too; but forgetting to smoke is more frequent

- This might sound stupid, but it's getting annoying to smoke. Where I'm at, it costed 1000FT (just under $5) for one pack. But recently, they increased it to 1020FT. Anything below 500FT is coins, and I really hate coins

- My sides have started to hurt. I have no idea whether that's because I'm sleeping wrong or I'm about to die of lung cancer. But it definitely got me thinking

- I ran out of cigs on 8/31 (the Fappening), but was too put off by the coins to go get another pack. And now, it's been two days, and I still have zero motivation to buy a pack

- Oh yeah, it's considered as very rude to bum cigs where I'm at

- Also, it's no longer about just the coins, I'm starting to feel put off by the fact that I have to walk to a specific shop to get another pack and go downstairs just to have a smoke...

~~So, yeah, I might as well keep going down this path and see how far I can get.~~ 

**(EDIT: Nope. Going to seriously do it now. The video really flipped the switch on me)**

Besides, I just took the time to email that bot for a badge. That was more work than I expected, and I suppose resetting it is just as "difficult". So, it might just be the final piece of motivation I needed.

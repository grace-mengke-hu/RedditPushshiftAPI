Day 5 of a Cold Turkey Quit

Holy cow I never thought I would make it this far.  I found my way here through my Smoke Free app and reading about everyone else's journeys has been incredibly helpful.  Its an awesome feeling to know you're not alone.  I've been a pack to a pack and a half a day smoker for the last 12 years.  When I woke up a couple weeks ago and realized in a very short time that will have meant half of my life, I freaked.  I made a vow to myself to quit cold turkey and that 2016 would be the absolute last time I had a puff of a cigarette.  Needless to say, I severely underestimated the crutch that relationship provided for me.  The cravings weren't so bad the first two days but these last three I'm finding that I want to crawl out of my skin when they happen.  However, I'm physically feeling so much better already.  Not wanting to disappoint smoke-free future me is what's keeping me motivated.

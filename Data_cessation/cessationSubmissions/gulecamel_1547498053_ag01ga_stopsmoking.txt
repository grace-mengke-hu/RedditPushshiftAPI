When to quit?

I really need to quit the smoking now. I just don’t know when to do it. Should I smoke the last one before I go to bed, when I wake up or quit after a night out. What did you succeed with? I personally really enjoy a morning cigarette, but I also never feel like smoking when I’m hungover. What do you think? Thanks in advance.

Hello again guys, I'm back at Day 0 again.

Day Zero.  I'm going with the 4mg nicotine lozenges again.  I'm committing myself to them.  Even if I can simply switch out my cigarette addiction for a lozenge addiction, even if I can never succeed on getting of lozenges, I figure either way I'll come out ahead.

So I'm on the first day, I've tried this many times before, but normally I would spit out the lozenge and just smoke.  I'm not going to do that this time.  The minute I change from cigaretts to lozenges, 1) I take my lungs out of the picture, and I'll get my breathing back.  2) I get past that feeling of slavery to the cigarette clock.  Should I smoke another one?  How long 'till a smoke break?  Is my boss going to comment on how often I'm running outside to smoke?  All that jazz, it just goes away.

I've tried to quit after being on lozenges for months, and always bombed.  So I'm just not going to worry about a possible end-game to this, I'm just a lozenge addict and I'm going to have to be ok with that.  I've tried acupuncture for this.  I've tried hypnotism.  Cold-Turkey.  I've read 3 EasyWay books.  Nothing has worked.  I'd prefer to be on patches, but I gave that a go a while back, and the heat and physicality of my job just *murders* the glue's ability to do its job.  I even tried an ace bandage wrapped around it to keep it in place.  So... lozenges.  See you tomorrow; I'll have flair!  Good luck, and never forget why you're a non-smoker now.

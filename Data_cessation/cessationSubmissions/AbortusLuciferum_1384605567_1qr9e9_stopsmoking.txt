I'm proud of myself.

Today was the first time that it's become clear that managed to quit. I came back from a night out with friends, it involved lots of alcohol, debauchery and cigarettes, oh god so many cigarettes. I craved a whole lot of them but didn't smoke a single one, and I'm proud of myself for that. Thankfully my friends actually took me seriously when I revealed to them that I quit, and they helped me out a lot. So I guess what I want to say here is, if you're gonna quit, take yourself seriously, and others will do the same. Lord knows how many times I failed to quit because I didn't take quitting seriously enough.

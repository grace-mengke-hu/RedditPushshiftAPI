stopping on the 30th of June

Been a smoker for 35 years, I'm not 45 yet. Between the age of 8 and 17 I smoked a cigarette or two a week, stolen from my mon's pack. Then when I started to have a social life I turned steady and apart from slowing down here and there and stopping for a few months 17 years ago I've been smoking a bit less than a pack a day until a month ago. 

After 15 years in the same place, I'm moving to a new apartment on the 30th of June. I decided to use that big change as a lever to stop smoking. For the last month or so I've curbed down my smoking to about 8-10 a day, smoked at specific times. Apart from party times I've mostly been able to stick to it. I've had health issues since mid-december - sinus and stomach related. Acupuncture is finally where I found a solution to those health problems. As I'm seeing him every week until I move I've asked the acupuncture specialist to help me with the cravings I'll experience when I stop.

- I'm stopping cold turkey. No patches, no vaping, no nicotine gum. All those things I've tried before and they make things worst or the secondary effects are worst than the cravings. I hope the change in daily routine and environment will help minimize the triggers I'll experience. That's where the acupuncture is supposed to help - minimizing the cravings. Anyone here has had experience with it? Any idea what other things I can do in the my last week and half to help me stop?

- Focussing on why I am stopping (health, being a better model for the kids in my life, money-sink, stink, uselessness) and paying attention to the beneficial effects are how I intend to stay strong. The list is long and motivating. There is nothing in the "pro" side of the list to smoking.

- I know from experience that I have to absolutely stop it - any little nicotine hit resets the clock and any progress is lost. No more tobacco is allowed. This will be hard as early summer is full of social events, parties, drinking with colleagues, chatting on the porch while having a drink with friends who smokes etc. I need the social and will not miss any of it, any idea on how to be stronger in those moments?

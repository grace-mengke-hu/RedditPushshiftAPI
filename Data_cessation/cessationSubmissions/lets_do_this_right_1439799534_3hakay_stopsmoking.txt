On day 45 today. I can't believe I could have made it this far. Also my 2 cents about quitting. Please read. May help you.

First off, a little bit about myself. I'm 31 years old, work a boring desk job, have never really been an active person. I started smoking at the age of 17 and have been smoking roughly 10 cigarettes a day. In the past I have smoked weed also heavily for around 8 years. Also, I believe I have a drinking problem and drink roughly 3 times a week consuming upto 360 ml of alcohol (usually some cheap whiskey) in a sitting. I used to smoke more when I'd drink, upto 15 cigarettes. The way I had been living, I never thought I'd ever begin to break out of this unhealthy lifestyle. Every morning my lungs would feel like tar pits and I'd hate myself. On the 4th of July, I made a decision to fix my life, one step at a time. The first step was to quit smoking.

I'd read the Allen Carr book around 5 years back so I remembered most of the stuff he said about cigarettes etc. **I absolutely recommend everyone here to read this book.** I have a few more points that I'd like to share with you all which might hopefully help you. These are the thoughts and feelings I went through. This is my experience so YMMV:

**When you decide to kick the habit:**

1. *You think that you may not be able to cope with everyday situations* - Well you did deal with stress before you started smoking. Even as a kid you have had stressful moments. Didn't you just simply deal with them? So why do you need a cigarette now? You don't.
2. *Meals may not be as pleasurable* - I had a habit of smoking after a meal. Well, the same principle as mentioned above. Before I started smoking, I didn't need a cigarette to enjoy a meal and I sure as hell don't need one now.
3. *Life is going to be hard without a cigarette* - You got it all backwards buddy. Life is actually gonna be easier. **You were playing the game on hard mode till now. Now we are going to switch it to easy mode.** Cigarettes had made your life tough. Coping with boredom, dealing with stress, enjoying a meal, spending long periods of time with your loved ones who are non-smokers, saving money, hell even simple things like running and climbing stairs. Breathing damn it. Smoking made everything tougher. You have played the game in hard mode until now. Let's make it easy.
4. *You are a non-smoker now* - Get into this mindset. You are not trying to quit. You've already quit. You haven't given up anything. In fact, till today you had given up; now you begin to reclaim what's yours.


**Dealing with the urge for the first 7 days:**

If you have recently finished the Allen Carr book, this is most likely going to be slightly easier. But I hadn't read the book recently so things were a little bit tougher for me. 

1. *Breathe* - Seriously. Do this when the urge hits you. Relax your diaphgram, let it move down to fill both your belly and lungs with air. **Feel your breath. This is your connection to life.** Observe your body. Observe how you feel. How bad is the urge really? Will it kill you? Stay with it. Are you a fighter? Will you come out alive? Embrace the discomfort. It is temporary. It fades away. You win.
2. *Time the urges* - How long does a typical urge last? It was roughly 90 seconds for me. **Breathe, time the urge.** In 90 seconds it's gone.
3. *Avoid alcohol* - Trust me on this one. I went for a drink with my friends on the 4th day. Almost caved in. I put my drink down and literally sat on my hands when the urge hit me. All these years of smoking had also made a 'muscle memory' of making me reach for a smoke while drinking. When you're drunk, your will is at its weakest, inhibitions are low. Better avoid this for a week. 

**Days 8 - 25:**

Things started to get better by now. Your body will begin to react positively.

1. *Lungs start to clear* - Use every change to motivate you and to strengthen your resolve. See cigarettes for the poison sticks they really are. They are specifically designed to numb the cilia in your lungs, to trap you in the nicotine trap. I began to spit out a lot of mucus. The mucus had small black-brownish dots in it, I panicked. A little bit of Google search and turns out many others have reported this thing. Apparently it's tar that your lungs are beginning to throw out.
2. *Taking stairs* - Remember easy mode? Yeah taking stairs is a part of easy mode. Initially I was out of breath after 3 flights. 3 became 4, 4 became 6 flights. Now I can run up 6 flights carrying my heavy ass laptop backpack.
3. *When the urge hits now* - This is basically what I was thinking, "Damn it, I'm not touching that bullshit poison stick!!. 20 days ago, I'd have given anything to be where I am now. I'm not throwing this away. **This is beautiful. This is precious. I'm better than ever before.**"

**After day 25:**

1. *I'm finding cigarettes absolutely disgusting now* - I dislike that smell. I find the cigarette smoke to be irritating. My friends smoke in front of me while we drink. I look at the ashtray and find it repulsive. One day a friend spilt some water on the ashtray. The damp cigarettes began to stink. I bet hell never smelt this bad. I felt I wanted to puke. Absolutely disgusting stuff.
2. *My will power has gone through the roof* - I feel more determined than ever before. I can take on the world. I'm fucking Superman.
3. *My stamina has increased* - I can jog small distances and do light cardio like star jumps etc. I started light exercise at home on day 15. 
4. *My erections are stronger and last longer* - I don't think this needs any elucidation. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
5. *Skin looks better* - Before I'd look pale, dry, wrinkly, like a dying man. Now I feel I have lesser wrinkles. Skin looks more alive. Must also be due to the fact that I'm much better hydrated now.
6. *Better digestion, bigger appetite* - Earlier, I'd hardly eat. People would tell me that I had a very bad diet for a male of my age and height (31, 6'0"). Now my appetite has increased and reached normal levels. I digest food better. My shit doesn't stink like before. I have better motions. I'm sure the slight exercise and increased water intake has helped but I also have a feeling that smoking hits your digestive system too. 

Sorry this post became a bit longer than I expected. If your experiences are similar to mine, I hope you find the points I mentioned here to be useful. Life is fleeting, life is short, but this life is yours. It belongs to you, not some stupid tobacco corporation and not to a stupid chemical. To me quitting cigarettes has been a journey that I have treasured until now. It has given me the resolve to improve my life. My next step is to cut out alcohol, perhaps keep it only to special occasions worth celebrating. I'm also going to start Couch to 5K. So stay strong guys and gals. Kick this dirty habit, trust me, it's for the best.

Day 5 of no Newport 100’s (menthol)

Well I am using 3 MG of fruity e-liquid, next month I’m going to go to zero and give it up completely. Vaping is a great alternative to cigarettes (yes there’s still nicotine, but not thousands of chemicals in a single cigarette.). It’s been a BITCH, because I’ve smoked Newport’s since I was 17, I’m 31 now. I don’t do the patches/gum whatever NRT. I have found an APP that has proved to help me out IMMENSELY. It’s called “Smoke Free”. It does a bunch of cool stuff. Like how your health is increasing, when you are craving a cigarette you can log it and see a calculated graph, amongst other cool things like “missions”. GET THE APP! Especially if you live alone it’s kind of like your motivator/side kick reminder why smoking destroys everything.

I also found a YouTube video that grossed the hell out of me whenever I thibk about my poor lungs and the torture I put them through for years. Here’s the video

And remember “Smoke Free” at the App Store!

I BELIEVE IN YOU ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND GOD!

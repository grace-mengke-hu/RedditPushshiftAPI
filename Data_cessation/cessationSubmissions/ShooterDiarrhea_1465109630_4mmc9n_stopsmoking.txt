10 days smoke free and I don't feel a thing

I'm not feeling any withdrawals at all. I mean, I am a little more tired than usual. (Got caught sleeping by the boss. YIKES!) BUT apart from that I feel pretty good. I've been walking a lot (I work construction and my site is a huge community project) and that helps. I'm not getting that feeling of "I NEED NICOTINE" at all. Anyone else not feel anything when they quit?

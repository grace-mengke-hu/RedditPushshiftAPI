Someone’s looking out for me

So, I had one of the worst days I’ve had in a long time. It was so bad I caved in and bought a box of cigarettes. I had one cigarette and somehow, in the walk back from the store to my apartment I lost the box of smokes. I’m normally not one to believe in signs or destiny but this really has me feeling like the universe is invested in my progress and is looking out for me. I shall soldier on.

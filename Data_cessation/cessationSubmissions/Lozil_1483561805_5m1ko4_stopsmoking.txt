Nightmare of smoking

[True Story]
Me and my friends were having a party in an unknown place and one of them passed a cigarette to me...!! I don't know how I picked it up and finished it.

Then I Started crying, Crying because I had quit for so many days. Just imagining the struggle I had gone through. This once cigarette will just break everything off. 

Then I started to wish it was a dream, Please let it be a dream.

Then I woke up from that dream. Never been happier... :) 

F**k Smoking...!! 
[This is a true dream I got in last few days]

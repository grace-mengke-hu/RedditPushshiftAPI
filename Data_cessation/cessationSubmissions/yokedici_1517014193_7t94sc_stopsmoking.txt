Got diagnosed chronic bronchitis

Around a pack a day for 10 years, can never ever smoke again
Its my 10th day today,i want to smoke so much, but think about it, i feel like iâ€™ve made a bad joke,even betrayed everyone who loved me, my grandmother,mother,my fiance...




They would all want me to quit so long ago already, but i kept smoking, i dont know there are faar worse diseases i and maybe i should be thankfull but i feel shit

A Cigarette would really help right now

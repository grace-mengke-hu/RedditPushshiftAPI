Quitting for a Job

I have been without a job since January. I got an offer from a health care company, but they will not hire smokers/nicotine users. I quit smoking four days ago. My drug/nicotine/cotinine test is in 10 days.

Does anyone have any advice for this? I want to quit permanently. Will all of the nicotine/cotinine be out of my system in 10 days? So far, I'm just drinking a shit-ton of water. Is there anything else that will help clear the cotinine?

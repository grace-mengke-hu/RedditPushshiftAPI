Thoughts from a former smoker, one month out.

It's been 35 days, and I've somewhat drifted away from this subreddit (which I guess in all reality is a good thing).  But I decided to come back and maybe provide some words of encouragement and a timeline of my journey.

25 y/o male - smoked for about 4-5 years, about a half pack a day, with obvious increase of smoking while drinking.  I made a handful of honest attempts to quit in the past year, which would last three to four days until I would go out for the night and it would start the cycle all over again.  It wasn't a set in stone target date.  I remember my last cigarette though, it was a Tuesday night after the Super Bowl.  I went out for drinks with a girl and started feeling very uneasy while smoking, which was a feeling I would get more and more as I approached quitting.  We came back, had sex, and my heart rate had to be ~190.  It was scary, I couldn't last more than two minutes without having to take a break and lay down to catch my breath and relax my heart a bit.  I knew then that it had to be done, this isn't normal.

**Days 1-3:**  I had cravings, I had anxiety, but I didn't have cigarettes.  I knew I was going to encounter anxiety anyway whether it be with or without cigarettes, so I willed myself to understand that a lot of my problems stemmed directly from smoking.  So why continue a vicious cycle?  A lot of positive self reinforcement was going on, as well as updating my roommate who urged me to quit (and ironically works for a big tobacco company).  I knew from reading this subreddit, and my previous attempts at quitting, that the WD symptoms peak at 48 hours and begin to subside.  

So what did I do?

* Drank a lot of water
* Ate moderately clean with salads, sandwiches, etc.  Nothing "filling" that would make me crave a cigarette.  - I think that's important.
* I snacked when I had urges - chips and pretzels.  Oral fixation with gum, mints.

**Days 4-10:** I went out for my first weekend as a non-smoker, and had to battle the cravings.  This is where I usually crack.  But it was a different feeling.  I wasn't thinking to myself "don't do it, you can do this," it was more of a "you're not a smoker anymore, so why would you?"  Well, we went to the local nightclub and the drinks and shots were flowing.  Oh boy, we're blacking out - I need to go home.  I drag my female friend (who smokes) outside and make her come home with me.  We're walking back and sure enough I smoked.  I woke up the next day - felt like DEATH (probably more from the hangover - but it was in the lungs and throat too).  But I said to myself, wow - what a dumb decision a non-smoker would make haha.  I went about my day without regret of smoking a cigarette and chalked it up to a learning lesson.  I'm still a non-smoker, it's more of a state of mind than a "fact". 

So what did I do?

* The workweek back, I started a workout plan.  Basic machine lifting and cardio.
* Cardio on my first day was *horrible.*  I'm talking I couldn't run 10 minutes without thinking I was going to pass out.  By the end of the week, I was up to 15.  *visual progress!*

**Days 11-20:**  I encountered the next weekend challenge, and I knew this time I was *not* going to smoke a cigarette.  I worked out all week, I got my cardio time up five minutes, and I felt great about it.  Why on earth would I ever want to have to re-do that week all over again?  I went out (even into a smoking bar) and did not have a cigarette.  Woke up the next day, twas a success.  I essentially repeated the process during the work week.

**Days 20-present:**  I feel great now, and I really only crave the occasional cigarette.  My circulation is awesome, I am no longer coughing, and I feel like I have a lot more energy.  I know I wrapped it up quickly, but it really isn't a part of my life anymore.

**Some TL;DR cliff note tips/tricks that I used**

* Drink lots of water and eat clean.  I've found fatty and filling foods triggered nicotine cravings.  Salads and sandwiches.  Keep it light.
* In between those clean meals - snack.  Chips, pretzels, etc.  You *may* go through a whole bag in two days but whatever.  Its better than nicotine, haha.
* Change your route to work if you can.  I noticed that I unintentionally started going home a different way because of construction.  I took the route home after the construction was over - and surprisingly craved a cigarette at this stoplight with traffic that I would *always* light up at, and this was just this past week.  Very interesting.
* Tell yourself of your progress.  Get one of those apps, I used "Quit Pro."
* Have a friend who will challenge you and listen to all your updates, and provide encouragement.

And lastly - I cannot stress this enough.  I know it's redundant and overstated, but you cannot quit unless you ABSOLUTELY want to quit.  

I am a **FIRM** believer in the cold turkey method (even though I kind of slipped and had one).  I tried to lean off method, but it doesn't work.  You still find excuses in those instances.

Cheers, and kick the nic.

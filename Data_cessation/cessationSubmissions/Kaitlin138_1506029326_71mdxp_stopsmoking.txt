Here I go again...

33 years old. Started smoking when I was 15. I've quit 3 times: first for a year, then a year and a half, then 8 months. I can quit cold turkey no problem when I decide that I'm really done. The problem for me is the long term. Had my last smoke last night, and I'm done for, hopefully, the rest of my life. Any long term quitters have any advice?

Advice please: How do you encourage/suggest/help someone quit smoking when they don't want to?

Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Really concerned daughter here, the rest of my family is as well. All of us have been trying separately for years to suggest/encourage mom to quit smoking, but she usually gets defensive and upset and leaves the room. I don't want to lose my mom, and I don't want to drive her away either. Her drinking and smoking got worse when her sister passed away unexpectedly about a year ago. She refuses to see a therapist or grief counselor despite witnessing positive experiences that other family members had with therapists and grief support groups.

&amp;#x200B;

What should we as a family do? Is there anything we can do to help if mom doesn't even seem to want to talk about it?

Thank you for your help, and I wish you all success on your journeys.

Nicorette gum question

So it's been 8 months since my last cig. I feel great and can breathe 100x better. However my cigarette urges have been replaced by nicorette urges about 3-4 times a day. Cost aside is it really bad to use this gum long term or can I just live with this as a permanent replacement?

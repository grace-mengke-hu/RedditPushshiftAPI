It has been exactly a week since I quit smoking and I'm finally starting to feel better. I turned 28 on april 8th, and i had a morbid realization. I have been a pack a day smoker for 10 years on that day. A decade of deadly smoke in my lungs. I thought I couldn't do it, not even for a day. Thank you for this sub and anyone who has posted and commented. Reading everything really made a difference. To anyone trying to quit, it gets better!

I'm sure this is dumb but I could use some reassurance.

I don't know that this is the right place for this type of post, and I'll delete it if it's not.

I'm not much of a smoker, I suppose you could call me a social smoker.   
I usually smoke weed but I moved to NZ a few months ago and there's a bad drought here so I can't get much.

I keep craving weed but since I can't get any I feel like smoking. I tell myself that I would only smoke occasionally and wouldn't make a habit of it, but I'm only like 70% confident about it. I feel like I could hold off but I realise how wrong I might be.

So I'm doing what I think might be the right thing and posting here to hear about your horror stories/reasons not to smoke.

Day 9...

So today is day 9 from smoking and being nicotine free. Last night was REALLY hard. I'm single and most of my friend are married. Friday nights tend to be a little boring so I took a ride to - to be honest - a strip club.

I'm not an angel. And, while I'm grateful for all the support people have been giving me with quitting smoking, sometimes I think they think I'm some sort of super hero or saint for doing it. I think that was part of the reason I went to the strip club last night. I don't normally go to them. But, I felt like I wanted to be "bad" - though, I hate using that term and judging people for their sexual activities.

Either way, between that and all the smoke (including two disgusting looking severely morbidly obese fat guys that sat next to me smoking cigars)... I feel dirty today.

I didn't smoke. But, I don't feel as clean as I did the rest of the week. I'm not calling it a step back.. but definitely a warning signal.

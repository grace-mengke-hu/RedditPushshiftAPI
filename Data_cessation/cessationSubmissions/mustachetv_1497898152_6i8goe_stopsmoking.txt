Day 1 again.

Need to update my badge but can't figure it out on mobile at the moment. 

I quit smoking on the first of the year and made it about 4 months before I let myself slip and got back into the habit again. I'm not proud of it but also not going to beat myself up too much either- figure I've still spent more time this year as a non-smoker than a smoker which is already a win for me, and plan to finish out the year that way too. Those 4 months taught me that it is actually possible and I know I can do it again. Here's to my last Day 1!

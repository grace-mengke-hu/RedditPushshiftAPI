Question for those who have switched to electronic cigarette after decades of extensive smoking

After switching there's supposed to be an coughing period in which lungs try to clean themselves up from tar etc. I've read that it might last a month or longer. Those of you who have been smoking a lot for decades and now have switched to electronic cigarette - please be honest, how long till the coughing stopped?

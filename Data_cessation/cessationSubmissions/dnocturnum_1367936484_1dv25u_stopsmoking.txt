30 days!

I smoked between five to ten cigarettes a day for over thirty years. Quit cold turkey and wish I had done it sooner. It hasn't been as difficult as I thought it would be. This site, the Cessation Nation app for Android and  Allen Carr's book which I read about a week or so in, were / are useful. Hang in there those of you just starting, it does get easier!

Nightmares after quitting smoking.

I haven't smoked cigarettes in 43 days and my nightmares since I quit have been HORRIBLE. They are so vivid, I wake up in panics and sweats. I don't sleep more than two to three hours after work (I work night shift) and it's just getting to be terrible. Anyone have any experience like this? I've gone cold turkey so its not being caused by any medications.

6 months cigarette free and I feel great!

Ah yeah, that felt great to type. I technically hit the 6 month mark yesterday but only discovered this subreddit today. 

Since I quit, I've had a lot more money and have felt amazing. I was surprised at what I was able to buy with money that would've gone to cigarette packs (I smoked almost 5 packs a day when I quit O.o) so I used it to get new habits. 

Started smoking at the age of 19, stopped this year at the age of 24. I feel like it was a long and hard 6 months, but I finally no longer get the urge to smoke, no matter how stressed out I am. All my friends knew and they took me out for a great night.

Advice to people that are struggling: just hang in there. It's really hard the first few weeks but it progressively gets better and the urge to smoke fades away. Once you completely stop, you'll look at yourself in the mirror with a feeling of accomplishment, and nothing beats that feeling.  

Can't wait to go a whole year smoke-free and look back at the journey and smile.

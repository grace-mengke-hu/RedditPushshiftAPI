What being a non-smoker did for me recently (inspiration for those of you who have newly quit)

I've been a non-smoker for 690 days today.  Last month, my mother had heart surgery and I spent over three weeks on various floors of various hospitals helping her recover from something that didn't go well.

Not once did I have to excuse myself to go downstairs and hide behind a six foot green electrical box in the rain to smoke a cigarette (this is a non-smoking campus).  From the eighth floor I could see a small collection of people huddling together hidden from the view of the main lobby behind electrical boxes across the street.

At the VA hospital next door, a small alcove provided a protected hiding place.  It only had room enough for one person, but there was always someone in the alcove.  Hiding.

I remember when the urge for a cigarette would have driven me out of my sick mother's room and behind that electrical box.  

Don't give those cigarettes the power to do that to you ever again.

Not one more.

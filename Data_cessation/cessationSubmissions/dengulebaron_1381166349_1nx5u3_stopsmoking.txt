Tomorrow is day one and I can't wait

I've tried a lot of times the last seven years, but this time it feels more right than ever before.

Method of choice is cold turkey assisted by acupuncture to help me get through the first difficult weeks.

The only thing that I am worried about is when my special one trigs me. This is a situation that usually happens when she hurts me - then cigarettes are my only comfort and escape. Please help me with advice for these special difficult situations, dear friends.

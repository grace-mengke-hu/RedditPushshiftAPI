Hey, r/stopsmoking. I need your help.

I'm a pack a day smoker. I'm only 19. I need help. I can't do this on my own.

I've been thinking about buying an eCig/Vape with no nicotine to trick my brain. I'm 5'5" and about 105lbs.

I can't keep doing this to myself. I can feel my lungs building up with tar, making it harder to breathe.

I need tricks, I need help, I need anything.



I just decided that I'm going to quit cold turkey. I'm a pretty antisocial guy, so I don't have someone to help me out with this.

The mindset that made quitting 'easy' for me.

One thing I realised from my quitting attempts is that it's all about having the right mindset.

In my earlier quitting attempts, I thought of (usually obvious) reasons to stop:

"Smoking is unhealthy, it stinks and it costs a lot of money".

These are all valid reasons, and if they work for you, great!

But for me they didn't. Deep down these didn't make me **against** smoking, I still liked it.

So I struggled a lot with every urge I got, and always started smoking again in a matter of a few days.

After these couple of attempts, the following thought popped up in my head:

"How is it even legal in 2019 to sell a product that's unhealthy, yet highly addictive? The government simply doesn't care because you a) pay more taxes and b) die earlier. A win-win for them. I've been so dumb to fall victim of this shit."

Right after that thought, I threw away my last few cigarettes and quit cold turkey.

Today, I haven't smoked for 1 month, while my other attemps have never been longer than 5 days.

I also didn't struggle at all, because I simply don't want to support it anymore.

It's more of a matter of principle, and that personally works best for me. So I thought about sharing it.

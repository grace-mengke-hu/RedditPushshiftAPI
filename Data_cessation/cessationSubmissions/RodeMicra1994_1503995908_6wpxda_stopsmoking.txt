non-smoker for 23 days

Have been smoking for about 3 years.
To me the baseline really is: don't give yourself a hard time 'missing' the ciagrettes.
You just think about the advantages when you're 'craving' again (though craving might be too big of a word).
I put it really simple here, but the book helps you to 'brainwash' yourself into the right mindset.
If you're really willing (but willing and willing can be two different things) I think it's really feasible with Allan Car.
By the way, I really feel better. I sometimes miss the 'comfort' of smoking a cigarette, but then i quickly realize it doesn't help shit and I'l be pumping my lungs full of filth if I smoke 'just this one' again.

Just tore up the pack I bought this morning. This is it...again...

I have tried to quit several times before.  It has really hurt me, physically and economically.  I bought a pack this morning.  Had a few.  I truly do love to smoke.  But this afternoon I found myself tired...I couldn't breathe...I was weazing.  I went into the other room, tore up the pack and I'm hoping this is it.  The start of the long road to recovery.  My girlfriend will be so happy.  God this is going to blow so much though.

EDIT:  Guys, please help me through this.  I honestly don't know if I have the strength.

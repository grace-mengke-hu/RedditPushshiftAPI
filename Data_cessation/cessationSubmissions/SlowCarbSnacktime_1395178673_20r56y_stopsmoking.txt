[fun] How have your tastes changed since you quit smoking?

I started smoking as a teenager so most of my adult life (in regards to food) has been clouded in nicotine and hot sauce. Since I quit smoking (I'm a little over a year out now), I've started eating all sorts of weird shit with my grown-up tastebuds that you couldn't have paid me to eat as a kid/as a smoker.

Do you have similar experiences, or vice versa? Is there something you have completely lost your taste for since you quit smoking?

I no longer gag at the site of beans or mushrooms on my plate, but unfortunately red wine is just not that enjoyable anymore.

Anyone else?

Not sure if this is similar to anyone else but the one thing I always had an urge to do in previous attempts was buy a pack if I had none left. Now that I've gone a month and 9 days I found my best idea was I left one smoke in a pack downstairs where I rarely go. I don't want it I don't need it but I have it and I don't need to pick any up from the store since I still have one. Just a stupid mental trick I guess but it helped me best of luck you can do this
TL;DR' Keep one smoke somewhere so you don't feel like you have none and need to buy them.

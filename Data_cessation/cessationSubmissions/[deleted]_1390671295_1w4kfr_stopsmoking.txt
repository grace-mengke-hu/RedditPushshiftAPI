Day 2 + The Flu

Looks like I'm in for a double-whammy. Yesterday was day 1 and by the end of the day I was suffering from body aches, headaches, coughing and a sore throat. At first I thought it was some kind of reaction to quitting, but this morning I realized I must have the flu. Great.

I'm using an e-cig with 3mg nicotine to get past the hard cravings. I don't pull it out more than once every few hours & so far it seems to be that tiny extra nudge in the right direction that I need. Maybe some of you here would disagree, but it seems to be working excellent for me.

Cheers & thanks for the support.

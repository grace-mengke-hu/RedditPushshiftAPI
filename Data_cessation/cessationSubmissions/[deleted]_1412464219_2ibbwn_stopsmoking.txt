I made a very bad mistake. I tried smoking.

So, last wednsday I had my graduation party, I was a bit drunk, and all my friends were smoking around me. I always hated cigarettes, and the smoke, but the alcohol in my blood thought otherwise. I asked a friend if I could try, he said sure, and taught me how to do it. My friends told me I ended up smoking a full pack, and I actually liked it. My mother smokes, and every time I see a cigarette, or even a butt, I can't stop thinking I *need* to smoke, and I got to the point of looking below the car seat for one I could smoke while I was out doing errands. In fact, I'm thinking about it right now. I want to erase this thoughts completely off my mind, since I know how many chemichals it contains and how bad it does to the body, aside from starting spending a whole bunch of money on cigarettes.

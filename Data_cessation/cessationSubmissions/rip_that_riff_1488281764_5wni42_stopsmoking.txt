16 Days and counting..

There had not been a single day in past 8 years that I didn't smoke. Quit 16 days ago, cold turkey. I so much loved cigarettes. The power you feel when you hold a cigarette, the satisfaction of inhaling that, and then to blow out a big cloud of smoke. I never thought of myself as a non smoker. But now I guess living is more important than smoking. If I can quit, any body can. Go for it, kick the butt. Fuck you nicotine. I'll get my dopamine from somewhere else

Quit attempt #43

Probably not actually that much but at least 20 half-assed attempts over the last 2-3 years. It's gotten to the point where all my friends don't believe I'm actually going to quit. Which is why I'm here. It'd be nice to have some support so if you have any advice or words of encouragement, it would be greatly appreciated!

Today marks 2 weeks..

First post, mostly here to vent I guess. Today has been one of the harder days I've had as far as cravings and in still staying strong despite working around smokers all day. I'm an avid collector and love my toys and I'm so excited to put my money toward something that really matters to me! 

Anyway, creeping this subs success posts has been giving me motivation so hopefully I can pass that torch on to a hopeful quitter one day.

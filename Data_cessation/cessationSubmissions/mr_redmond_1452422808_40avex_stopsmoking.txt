48 Hours nearly done. But damn I feel so tiered.

I'm still in the early stages. I've nearly done day 2 using NRT (Nicorette mist spray). I dont use it all to often and try to ride out the storm. Things are going well.

Two things that are happening to me at the moment which I'm not liking are:

1. Agitation, and angry feelings. I woke up this morning in a foul mood. Took a good 15 minutes for me to get out of it. It's still lingering slightly.

2. Tiredness. I just feel like I could close my eyes and go back to sleep. My whole body feels slow and tiered.

I'll keep plodding along, but would like to know if this is the norm?

On the positive side of things, I suffer with pacs and pvcs. They're heart arrhythmias that are not life threatening or dangerous (had many tests in the past 10 years). They're just annoying. Since stopping smoking those have almost stopped completely :)

I'm also eating a lot more. When I smoked I would struggle to eat 3 meals a day and always skipped breakfast. Now I can't stop eating :S

I might challenge myself to 100 press ups x 3. That should kick the tiredness up the backside.

Push ups turned into a 20 minute workout. Now feel wide awake and alive. Job done :D Kiss my ass smoking! Wish I had a gym that's accessible. Since moving house my gym is some 12 miles away and very difficult to get to without a car. Damn villages!

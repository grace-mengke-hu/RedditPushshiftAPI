50 days! High fives!

I just want to pat myself, and all of you on the back for our excellent progress.  It feels so good to have come this far, and it'll feel even better at 100.  200.  400.  800.  I love that I'm no longer a smoker.  I love checking "no" on the dating sites because even though I quit smoking, I'm still horribly lonely.  Who cares?!  I'm happier now than I was as a lonely smoker.

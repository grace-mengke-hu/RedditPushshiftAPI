Intense cravings - Need help

I'm a doctor and currently interning at a very heavy hospital in Obstetrics department and I have long shifts of 24 to 36 hours at a stretch. I rarely get to sit or sleep, but get few coffee breaks. Tomorrow is my first emergency duty after I decided to quit. Smoke used to really help me through the frustration of work. I'm worried I'll relapse if the work gets to me.

Question about the pokémon

Hi everyone! 

I'm a smoker working on quitting by slowly reducing. I tried quitting cold turkey more times than I bothered to count. 

Fingers crossed, I should be smoke free by next month. 

Quick question about the pokémon, I understand that they're for motivation and honestly I love it. What I'm wondering is, before posting them, are we required to draw them ourselves? Do they correspond with how many days we are smoke free?

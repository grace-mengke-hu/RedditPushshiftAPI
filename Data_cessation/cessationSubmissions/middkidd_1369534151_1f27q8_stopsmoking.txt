600 Days

I remember walking down the street after having quit for 10 days one time and picking up a pack of cigarettes, smoking one and then crying.  That was a really terrible moment in my life.  

Now though, one more quit and 600 days later, life is infinitely better than any life that includes tobacco, nicotine and cigarettes.

Swimming, running, playing games outdoors, climbing stairs...these can all be fun instead of scary.  Going out at night is a pleasure because I don't have to spend my whole night smoking.  Heck, even if I couldn't get a taxi home...I could just run!

Work is easier and more productive.

You can do it.

Read The Easyway to Stop Smoking ... if you really want to quit.  Good luck and happy reading.

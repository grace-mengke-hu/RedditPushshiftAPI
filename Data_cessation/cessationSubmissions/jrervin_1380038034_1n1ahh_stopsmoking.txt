Relapse Dreams

So I quit a little over two months ago and I've started having weird dreams. About once a week (and increasingly more frequently) I have dreams where I smoke a cigarette. 

They're super realistic. No wacky cartoonish stuff, and I usually feel really guilty while I'm there. 

The next morning I wake up and feel like shit. After a few minutes I realize that it never actually happened. It's super bizarre. 

Anyway, does anyone else get these?

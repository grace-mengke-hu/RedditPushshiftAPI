Cravings

Those who have quit smoking, how long did it take for you to stop thinking about smokes every 30 seconds? 
I’m 1 day in and I can’t wait for when I barely think about them but right now it’s like every 30 seconds I think about it and get sad I can’t have one, lol. 
so I’m wondering around what point in your journey you realized “I haven’t thought about having a cigarette today”

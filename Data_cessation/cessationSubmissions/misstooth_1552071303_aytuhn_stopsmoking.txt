Highly addicted to nicotine gum

Hey folks,

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a complex situation. I have agoraphobia and anxiety issues. I managed to stop smoking but the withdraw feelings really freak me out sometimes and make those issues worse. So I chew nicotine gum. For about two years now. I started to gauge how much gum I chew. It's about 2 packs of cigarettes worth a day. Maybe more. It's a ton. It feels like pain when i don't have it. Should I cut down slowly over time? Cold turkey sounds so hard. Should I switch to patches? Anyone else been through this?

"Cravings are very different from the hunger for food. If you don't eat you get hungrier. Whereas if you don't smoke, your cravings become less severe."

I'm using the Smoke Free app to help motivate myself. Each day it gives you a little "mission" or motivational quote or whatever. Today's is to "let cravings pass," which reminds me a little of meditation. In meditation, you are not supposed to force thoughts out of your mind or try not to think; in order to make your mind blank, you become passive. Thoughts *will* come; you are supposed to notice them as they come, and simultaneously let them go, not focus on them or anything but your breathing. If you think "Crap, I'm *thinking* again, I'm not supposed to do thatâ€“" it's counterproductive because you have to think, and expend cognitive energy doing that. Just let them go and they will leave on their own.

I liked this quote because it reminds me that nicotine cravings are the same. They WILL go away on their own (unlike real biological necessities, like hunger, thirst, need to pee)! When I am craving a cigarette today, I will not focus on it, I will not give in, but nor will I wreck my brains wishing I weren't having it. I will notice it, accept that it is there, and let it quietly slip away on its own. And then I will eat something :D DAY THREE GOING STRONG

[ps if anyone else is using the Smoke Free app you will notice I edited their quote for grammar, you can't be different to]

Strategies to quit

I'm on day 2 and wanted to share some of my strategies: hot herbal tea that smells really good, nicotine gum when the craving is bad (after dinner has been the worst so far), and candy crush - I think it taps into the dopamine/reward center in my brain and gives me something to do with my hands and distracts me, and of course walking my dog Any other suggestions?

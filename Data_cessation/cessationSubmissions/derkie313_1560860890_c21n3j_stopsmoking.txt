Calluses/peeling skin??

I got acupuncture to quit smoking on May 31st. After that I had tiny little bumps on my fingers and wrists. Now my fingers have very dry spots that are tough like calluses and are peeling. Has anyone else had this? The spots that have the most callus are the fingers on my right hand that I used to hold my cig with, which is why I wondered if itâ€™s related to quitting.

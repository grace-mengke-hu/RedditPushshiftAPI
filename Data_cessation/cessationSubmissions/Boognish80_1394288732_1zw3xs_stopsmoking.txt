Taking lent as an excuse to quit for good :)

My boyfriend and his roommates are quitting smoking and drinking for lent, so what better excuse to so something I've been wanting to do for a long long time. I have no intention of starting again on Easter, that's stupid. I'm on day 2 cold turkey and I honestly feel like a million bucks. I got up this morning at 7, took care of my pets and went for my first run of the year. I have spent the past 2 years losing nearly 65 pounds, working hard on my mental and physical health, and every time I pick up a cigarette I just want to snap it. It is undermining all of my hard work, making me broke, smoking too much is keeping me awake at night, giving me asthma and bronchitis (not to mention lung cancer runs in my family), and I worry that smoking in the house around my cats is making them sick as well. I have no much motivation to quit that every time the urge crops up I drink a glass of water and think about how much I hate it and it's truly been kinda easy so far :)

Tips on First stopping?

I just smoked my last cig. Gave up drinking awhile back and am ready to stop smoking now. My favorite cig of the day was always with coffee in the morning, so I'm worried about that craving coming back. How did you guys deal not necessarily with the urge to smoke, but to the habits of smoking? That's what I think will be my toughest battle.

Just stopped by to check my flair...

...and a year has already gone by! I feel proud I've accomplished this. It hasn't been easy, and I do get cravings still occasionally, even a year later. Usually they come and go without at fight, though.

With all the money I've saved not smoking, I've invested more into retro gaming again. I can safely say I've still spent far less doing that this past year than I would have buying cigarettes. Crazy thought.

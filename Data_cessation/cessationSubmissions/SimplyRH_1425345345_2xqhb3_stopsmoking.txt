Just realized it's my cake day. Missed mine last year, didn't know how to celebrate so I'm celebrating with you all!

/r/stopsmoking is the closest I have to a Reddit home, and I don't really know what is so special about cake days but hey, my reddit account is two years old today, and I'm 77 days smoke free! Here's to the next year, and 365 more days smoke free!

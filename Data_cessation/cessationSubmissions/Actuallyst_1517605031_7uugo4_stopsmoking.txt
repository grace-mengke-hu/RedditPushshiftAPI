Dropping the ecigs

I quit smoking cigarettes about a month ago. I started off with nicotine gum, but I hated how it burned my mouth.  I tried the patch in a previous attempt and it did nothing, so I picked up an ecig on day 3 this time.

I've been doing great not smoking, but I want to cut nicotine out entirely. Anyone else go from cigs to ecigs to nothing? Did you taper down, just stop one day? I already feel so much better, but I'd love to be totally clear!

Feeling sick? is this normal?

hey everyone,

i smoked for about two years and decided to call it quits about a week ago. the first day I was craving a lot, and the worst thing was the night time sweats, and hot/cold sweats during the day. This whole last week I felt really flu-like towards the end of the day, but going to the gym helped me sweat a LOT actually. I also developed a sore throat two days ago. Are these all withdrawl symptoms?? Does anybody else experience this?

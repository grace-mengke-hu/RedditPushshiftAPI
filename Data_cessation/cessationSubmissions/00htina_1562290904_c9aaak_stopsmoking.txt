I only smoke 6 a day!

I only spoke 6 cigarettes a day! I’ve tried to quit 1000 times but I always cave and buy a new pack. I can go a week or even a month without smoking and then I suddenly just want to smoke again and I give in.


What was the best way to quit for everyone? Whenever I’d smoke the hardest part of saying no was that everyone around me was smoking but now I barely see my smoking friends. 

I feel like I have no reason not to quit but I just can’t commit to it! Any advice/tips from actual quitters would be great instead of google advice!

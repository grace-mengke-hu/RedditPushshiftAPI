F**k You, addiction.

2 days of intense dizziness, nausea, headaches and muscle aches. Hmm, didn't read about THOSE symptoms when quitting smoking; better get checked. Everything fine - blood pressure, temp, pulse, blood work. It's withdrawal. Am steaming mad that I wasted 2 days thinking I was actually sick when I'm just a recovering addict. Well f**k you, withdrawal symptoms. Popped 2 painkillers and went and had an anger-fuelled weight-training session just now and.I.Feel.Great.  this is NOT going to beat me. I am NOT giving in.

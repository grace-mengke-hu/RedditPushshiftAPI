The struggle is real

I recently decided it was time to quit smoking. I went 23 hours without one the first attempt. Next day, I only smoked 6, and the next day 8. I can see that if I'm cutting back, each day needs to be the same or less, but I keep making excuses. I know the health benefits will outweigh the struggle, but I suck under intense pressure. I always over analyze everything. I can't find a way to keep my mind off of it. I start panicking if I'm out and it consumes me. I don't have any hobbies to keep me busy, and I sit pretty idly at work and am allowed to smoke.
Any ideas??? I want to kick this so badly, but don't know if I have the will ðŸ˜•

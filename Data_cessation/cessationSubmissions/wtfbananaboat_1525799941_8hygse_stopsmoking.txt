Today I celebrate 3 years smoke free

3 years ago a month before getting married to the love of my life I quit smoking. 15 years smoking a pack a day, I bought Allen Carr's guide to quitting smoking, read it over the course of a week, and extinguished my final cigarette while closing the final page with a huge smile on my face. I had basically no withdrawal, but did put on some weight after quitting. 1 year ago I got into C25K and got into the best shape of my life.

Last night for the first time in years I dreamt that I smoked, I remember in my dream feeling helpless, like I'd ruined all the hard work into quitting, thrown it all down the drain. I woke up with the biggest relief I've felt. I'm still smoke free, and will be for the rest of my life, for me, my wife and my new child. :\)

What might I expect in the coming weeks?

After having smoked an average of about a pack a day for about 12 years without ever trying to quit before, I decided that 1/1/2015 was the day. Had my last cigarette not too long after the ball dropped and I just started patches this (well, now yesterday) morning. My short-term motivation is that I didn't want to potentially ruin my dress with ash and smoke on my wedding day (in April) and my long-term motivations include an overall bettering of health (I've been watching what I eat and trying to exercise more than sporadically as well), wanting to have healthy kids one day, and bettering my voice and lung capacity (I like to sing). 

Since my fiancé quit about a year and a half ago, I know I'm in for some sleepless nights at first and probably some elevated levels of anxiety and irritability and we worked out a plan for dealing with those things at home. My plan for former smoke breaks at work is to turn that sporadic exercise into regular exercise instead of smoking. I bought nearly all the Trident gum at the grocery store check-out to keep myself from chewing a hole in the inside of my lip (something I'm prone to do when I haven't smoked in awhile). But I can't help but feel like I'm missing something. 

My fiancé smoked maybe a half pack a day at his worst, plus he's just one guy, so I'm not sure if his experience quitting would be similar to what I'm about to go through. So, (tl;dr:) **I'm asking what all I can or might expect in the next coming weeks so that I'm not caught off guard**. 

Many thanks in advance!

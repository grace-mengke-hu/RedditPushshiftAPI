i quit smoking three days ago!

woooo. i ran out of cigarettes, and had a busy weekend with a wedding and then it snowed so much that i opted to not leave my house to buy more and you know what? fuck smoking! 

i'm a little nervous though because i didn't have my last cigarette thinking it would be my last. i didn't savor it. but, what would that have meant anyway? maybe it's better this way?

i've quit in the past, six months from feb 2013-aug 2013 and then five months from mar 2010-aug 2010. i want this to stick! every time i start smoking again it feels good...but then it gets to that place where i know the next cigarette will not make me less stressed, or more focused, or less upset, but i do it anyway. i stare at my butt and think, this does me nothing. 

ahhhhh. so yeah, just rambling but i wanted to share. to everyone else, keep it up!

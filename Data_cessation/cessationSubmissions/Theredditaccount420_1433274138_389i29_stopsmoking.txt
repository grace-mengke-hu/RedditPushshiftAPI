Need advice on quitting

I am an 18 year old high school graduate who has smoked since I was 16. In between those two years I have quit twice. Once for a little under a month cold turkey. The next time I switched to vaping for about two months, and stopped that for another month after weening myself off that. Since then I have picked it back up for about another month now. There were times were I'd smoke almost a half a pack a day on occasion, but now I have to were I was when I started. Three to four cigarettes a day. I really want this time to be it. Only I don't know how best to go about it. I smoke so little right now that I'm worried something like nicotine gum might be giving more nicotine than I get from smoking three to four a day. I also don't know that I'd be willing to buy a new vape, since I gave my old one to my older brother to help him quit. Maybe if I channeled my will power I could do it cold turkey, but I'm interested to hear what all of you think. Thank you.

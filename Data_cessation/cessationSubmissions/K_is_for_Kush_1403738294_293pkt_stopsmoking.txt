Stopping after 7 years.

I just got my wisdom teeth extracted (all four) and the oral surgeon said I shouldn't smoke for a few days afterwards. At first, I was thinking "how the hell am I gonna do that, I smoke a pack a day" but then I decided to change my view on it. I have been cold turkey smoke-free since 11:30am yesterday and I plan to stay that way. I feel great, though I have been a little ticked off with the cravings. Any tips to handle those would be greatly appreciated. :D

Thanks guys!

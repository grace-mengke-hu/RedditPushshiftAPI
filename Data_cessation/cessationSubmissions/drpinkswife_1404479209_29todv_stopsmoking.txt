Smoking Causes Stress

Went to my stress, I mean job to see when they will let me return and they are making it complicated like I knew they would - I didn't get stressed. (and I got a compliment on my skin...AGAIN).

My driving instructor said I'm so much calmer.

I'm not fighting with my husband.

People that annoy me still annoy me, but I don't have to react anymore.

This is what should be on the side of a pack of cigarettes! **Smoking makes you feel like SHIT and act like a BITCH.** **Cigarette companies are making you their bitch every time you buy a pack**

I'm still emotional, but not like I was. It's like good emotions. Even the bad ones. 

Why didn't anyone tell me it could be like this!?!?!

Those are my thoughts for today....

Keep it up quitters!!!!

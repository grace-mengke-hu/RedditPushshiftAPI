My uncle just had a heart attack and passed away. He was a lifelong smoker.

It's an incredible coincidence that I see this sub the morning I get the news. 

He was in his early 60s and smoked his entire life, only giving it up when his wife was pregnant. As soon as he felt comfortable smoking again, he'd step outside and light up.

He was in full cardiac arrest, was shocked a total of 11 times, and had CPR on and off for about an hour. We were told that his cardiac cath was difficult because his arteries were "strange", probably due to years of smoking. 

Smoking doesn't just affect your lungs.

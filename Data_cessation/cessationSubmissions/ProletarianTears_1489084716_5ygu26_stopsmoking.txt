A cigarette or a Big Mac?

So today, on my way to university, I have  encountered a minor problem. Whilst parking in a really narrow spot, scratched a bumper of a car in front of me. While the owner was watching. Long story short - almost an hour of arguing, police stories and missed chemistry assignment. When the whole thing was over, want I wanted the most in life was a lovely cigarette, but after some 20 minutes I decided to take an extra large Big Mac meal instead, and you know what? It was worth it :) considering that I am a quitter for just a weak, I believe that it is quite an accomplishment!

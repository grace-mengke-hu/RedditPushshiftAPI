Week 3's getting rough. Wish me luck!

I've been smoking for only a couple years and just started realizing I couldn't breath like I use to.  It started as just 1 or 2 every now and then to somehow smoking a pack a day.  I started smoking E-cigs and tapered off the nicotine levels for about 4 months.  Now, I've stopped all together with a little extra motivation from a new girl in my life.  It's officially been 2 weeks since I've smoked and I feel like I'm going through to hardest part.

Reading through all these little posts keeps it on my mind to say no to the urge.  Thanks guys, wish me luck.

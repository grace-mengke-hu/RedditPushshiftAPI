So I guess I'm gonna quit

Hey people. I started smoking when I was almost 18 (common in Europe), I'm turning 20 next week and have been thinking about quitting before I'm **really** addicted.

There are some problems though.

* I enjoy smoking
* I know about the bad side effects, but I enjoy smoking too much
* see #1 and #2

I know quitting smoking is one of the things that you only appreciate after you quit... Been through the same shit with weed. So, remind me why one should quit, please

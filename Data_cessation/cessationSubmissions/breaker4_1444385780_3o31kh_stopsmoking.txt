Subscribed Yesterday, need some advice.

Hi people, first off I want to say this sub sounds awesome. So on to the details. Been smoking 5 years now about 5 -15 a day, Started at 19, Ever since then I've know I need to quit. I have tried, cold turkey, e-cigs, vapor cigarettes, and nicqurette gum. I've been to my GP asking for help and downloaded any app I could find to help me. None of my friends or GF smoke, parents don't either. I've still relapsed every time. longest streak has been 3 months cold turkey. I'm feeling pretty lost at this point because I really have tried. So far I haven't had one today but I can't see that lasting too long, I'm currently sitting in work typing this with nicqurette gum in my mouth trying to distract myself. So yeah and advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

just smoked my last cigarette :/

First of all, sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native English speaker.

I have been smoking for 17 years now, and I smoke about 40-50 cigarettes per day. In last two years I realised how much smoking affected my life. I hate myself for being weak. I tried to quit about 6 times, and the longest period without cigarettes was 3 months.

This is actually my first post on reddit, and I really hope you guys can help/motivate me to become a non-smoker.

I smoked my last cigarette 20 minutes ago. I'm scared shitless to be honest. :(

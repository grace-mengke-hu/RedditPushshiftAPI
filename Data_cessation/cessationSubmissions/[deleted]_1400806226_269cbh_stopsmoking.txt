Help me quit! :(

18 year old here. Started smoking when I was 17, have been smoking for around 11 months, when I was 15-16 I told myself I would never, ever smoke, it smelt disgusting, the advertisements on TV made it look disgusting & I saw it as filthy. About 12 months ago, I found myself with a group of friends and we smoked quite a bit of cannabis, most of them already smoked cigarettes, and well, that's how it started. 

Now 11 months later.. I'm smoking a whole pack and over a day. I'm disgusted. 

I've been considering trying the nicabate patches (step 1) and slowly weaning myself off it. I've already tried to quit cold turkey, and it will not work with me sadly, the urge is too strong and I don't feel I have the self control. 

I WANT to quit. 

I come from a family who smokes, both parents, very heavy smokers and the entire family smokes. I want to quit before I seriously damage my health as I've only been smoking for 11 months now. 

I've looked online about "Chantix" tablets and it appears they work very well, some people reported quitting smoking in as little as 2 weeks, but the side effects of Chantix are pretty serious... hallucinations reported, lucid dreaming, strange dreams, vomiting, feeling sick. The chemical inside chantix appears to be very effective because in a simple sense, it blocks nicotine from entering the brain, which is very effective instead of using patches to wean down the nicotine levels & smoking itself. 


Please help? Advice? :(

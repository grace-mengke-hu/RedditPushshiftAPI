Still craving.

It's been a month since I've smoked a cigarette.  I've been free of all nicotine for the first time in 14 years.  I know i'm past the physical need.    

I Just don't know why i still keep wanting a smoke so bad.  I hate the idea of touching one, but the urge is still there and I cant break it

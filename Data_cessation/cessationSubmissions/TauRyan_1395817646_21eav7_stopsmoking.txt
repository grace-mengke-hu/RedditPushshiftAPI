At exactly midnight last night, this is what the QuitNow! App told me...

* > QuitNow! Since Nov 25, 2013:
* > 120 days smoke free,
* > 1,200 cigarettes down,
* > $300.00 and 5 days, 00:00:00 saved!

4 months down! And that $300 is already spent, though. It paid for my registration for Tough Mudder and 2 Spartan Races coming up in May! I don't think I could do those if I was a smoker, still.

Holy Shit! 1,200 cigarettes?!?! I mean, when I think about all the tar and chemicals and other crap I have kept out of my body from 1,200 cigarettes.... wow, just wow....

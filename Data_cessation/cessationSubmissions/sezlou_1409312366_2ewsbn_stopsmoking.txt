Thanks for being my support :)

To all of you on this thread, thank you for posting or reading my posts. It's been helpful just to know there are other people out there who are or previously have gone through the same struggles and triumphs I'm going through right now. I'm so fricking proud to declare today 4 weeks smoke free. I couldn't have done it without this site. Just coming on to ramble and seeing people actually understanding has been a lifesaver and scrolling through other people's posts helped me feel I wasn't alone on this quit journey. So yeah that was cheesy and I probably seem pretty strange :P but seriously this community has kept me strong...so cheers guys! :)

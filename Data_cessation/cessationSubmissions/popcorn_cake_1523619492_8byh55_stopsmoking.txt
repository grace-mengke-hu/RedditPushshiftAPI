Extreme fatigue &amp; headaches?

I've been smoking for three years and have decided to quit. Three days after quitting I started to wake up with extreme fatigue and horrible headaches. Sometimes so bad I could barely get out of bed. Is this a common occurrence for anyone else? Will it go away eventually?

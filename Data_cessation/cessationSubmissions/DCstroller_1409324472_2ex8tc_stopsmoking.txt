Shortness of breath and chest pain

Hey guys, quick question. Has anyone else experienced shortness of breath and chest pains after quitting? I just quit about a week ago and I'm coughing up a lot of phlegm and am more out of breath than i was before. I'm going to the doctor but I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this?

Snus Animosity

Just wanted to say that I switched to using Snus from smoking about 2 months ago. 

A little background info... I was a heavy smoker for about 10 years, I'm 27 now.

I only use Snus when I drink alcohol to defer the urge to smoke, which seems to only happen when I drink. I usually drink socially (and sometimes fairly heavily) about twice a week.

In the past two months I've been able return to running, and exercise in general. I have a ton of color back in my face and generally look better than I have in a long time.

I know that Snus has its own heath implications, but I feel as if it got me out of a lazy and age old cycle of habitually smoking and being lazy.

I do plan to drop it at some point, but if I were to give anyone advice in regards to that "urge to smoke" that comes along with alcohol, Snus is a great way to give your lungs a break.

Life without smoking is fucking awesome, and I want people to realize that the stuff you are inhaling is available elsewhere.

I want some discussion though, I'm curious to hear what you all think of Snus and if you think it is a path to better heath or just a path to another demon.

Edit: I order all my snus from Sweden and do not touch domestic US Snus Product

Back again: I'm not sure Cold Turkey is for me.

Hi guys, 

I quit in September using the Allen Carr method and I think I lasted around two months. The first month was really tough for me, I had horrible fights with my mother and my girlfriend.

The first day I quit I started walking for an hour each day. I did this for about a month and then I started getting hit with really debilitating anxiety. I've always suffered from anxiety, but this kind seemed extreme. If I couldn't work from home, I'm sure I would have been fired. 

I've just landed a new job in a sales position, so stress is something to be expected. But I have plans to try to quit again after I've settled into the new workplace. I'm just so worried that I will be crippled by anxiety again, or even worse, lose my cool at work. 

I'm wondering whether nicotine replacement therapy might work better for me? Or perhaps it's something I'm doing wrong with the Allen Carr method? I would really appreciate your thoughts and words of wisdom.

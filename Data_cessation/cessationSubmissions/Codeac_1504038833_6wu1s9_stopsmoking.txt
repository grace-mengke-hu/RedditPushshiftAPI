What else can I smoke / vape?

Hey StopSmoking community, just after a bit of advice. I'm 36 years old and never smoked in my life. Mostly I was an anti-smoker most of my life. HOWEVER, this year I got into a relationship with a smoker and after about 6 months I thought I'd just try a cigarette since I was also dabbling in the odd vape session of weed, and wondered what it would be like to try actually smoking weed... so I tried smoking cigarettes first. Weirdly I enjoyed the instant buzz, and the relaxed feeling. Being surrounded by a smoker, I found I quickly over a few months bumped up to around 3 - 5 cigarettes a day. Most days I'll have 1 - 2, sometimes 3 - 5 now, which I never thought I'd ever do in my life... so I have a Flowermate V5.0S vape and wondered, is there anything I can vape instead of weed, as I want to quit smoking completely however have found that it's become more of a social habit now with my fiance through the day. I guess it's more about how to still enjoy those peaceful 3 mins of chilling out smoking/relaxing effect, but cutting out the cigs completely. Any suggestions? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

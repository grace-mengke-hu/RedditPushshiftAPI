4 days in and I just smoked one.

I started using the patch four days ago, and it was going really well. I was having a few cravings, but I was mostly able to shake them by just chewing a piece of gum or focusing on other things. However, today was my first day off of work and depression really hits me hard in the evening.

Usually, I smoke weed to cope with depression, but I was all out. I found a cigarette and smoked it. Not only that, but I smoked half of another. I was feeling so much better, and now I'm back to square one. I just felt like I had to vent about this to keep motivated. I just put the patch back on, but damn, now I need another four days to get back to where I was. Whelp, here we go!

Personal Milestone (Day 85)

If anybody would've told me on the evening of July 14th that I wouldn't have another cigarette through my 27th birthday I would've laughed them outta the room - in actuality, I probably wouldn't have made it this far. 

But....

Here I am, I'm turning 27 tomorrow, which will be my 85th day clean! It's nice to have and set goals, but I never did set a goal; I quit to see how far I could make it. And now, every day is a personal best for me, and it's awesome. I look forward to every day I go without a cigarette (in the same way that I used to look forward to having a cigarette ironically).
So... Here's to day 85!

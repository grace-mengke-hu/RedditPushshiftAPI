Husband 2 weeks smoke free- wants to stop the patch

First of all, thanks so much for this community. 

I know this is a bit non traditional but you guys have been so great helping me help my husband make it so far. He’s not on Reddit so I’ve just been using your advice as support and your awesome ideas and suggestions. 

He stopped smoking over four weeks ago but had a couple of 1/2 cigarettes he now says he regrets. He says it didn’t make him feel better and only worse for “giving in”.  He’s been completely smoke free over two weeks. 

He’s still struggling with cravings that are vicious and wants to stop using the patch because “I still have the cravings so why am I using them”. I’ve tried to help him understand that the cravings would be so much worse without the patch. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? He’s come so far and I’m so proud of him. I just want to encourage him to keep going. 

Thanks in advance.

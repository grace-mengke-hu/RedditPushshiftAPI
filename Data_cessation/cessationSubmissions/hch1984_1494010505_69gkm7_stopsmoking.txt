Feeling Like A Cheat!

So I stopped smoking cigarettes about two weeks ago but have been using an e-cigarette instead. 
I know that, in comparison, using an e-cig is much better than actually smoking but I can't shake this feeling that I've not really kicked the habit. 
That then turns in to me thinking that I'm a bit of a failure because I haven't stopped my nicotine intake completely (although I do appreciate that I've reduced it...smoking 20 a day and then going to 2/3's of a tank of liquid is a definite reduction in nicotine)...this train of thought then turns in to "well, I might as well just have a cigarette!"! 
I've managed to, and will continue to, not listen to those cravings but I just wondered if anyone else has ever felt like this?! ðŸ˜©

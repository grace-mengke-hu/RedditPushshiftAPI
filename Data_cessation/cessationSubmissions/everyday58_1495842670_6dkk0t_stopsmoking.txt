Tomorrow is my quit date!

I'm 58 and have been smoking since 1975 less 14 years when I quit when I was first pregnant. I've been reading Allen Carrs book for the fourth time hoping it would just sink in and this would be magically easy. What has sunk in is how messed up my thinking is around smoking and how I have justified it so I could continue to smoke. I want to quit for several reasons, to rid myself of the expense, rid myself of this cough and the crap that comes up, hopefully rid myself of the thickness in my throat as I fear something dreadful has taken root. I'm tired of washing my hands and face throughout my work day, trying to  get rid of that stink before I return to work. How awful it must be for others to smell that foul stench. I would like to climb a flight of subway stairs and not loose my breath. I would like to hear someone say I smell good. 

I tell you. I'm scared of the panic after I smoke my last cigarette. How will I get through those first moments of no cigarette that first morning. Or the subsequent three to ease that cry for nicotine. Should I still take breaks at work or just try and keep busy. Should I try and sleep as much as possible tomorrow? Or face it like a big girl. 

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this.

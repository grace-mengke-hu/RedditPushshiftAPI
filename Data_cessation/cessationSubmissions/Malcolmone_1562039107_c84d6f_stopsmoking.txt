Anger management?

I stumbled across this sub at just the right time. I want to try quitting again but the problem is I lose my temper incredibly quickly when I'm trying to quit. I end up breaking things and throwing things and making my wife upset (she knows I'd never hurt her but it's still upsetting) I dont want to be angry but I want to quit smoking. Has anyone found methods that are actually effective for this type of thing?

When not even THAT would make you want to smoke again

So, I guess my sense of smell is back in full force. Spent 2 hours sitting next to someone smelling of stale sweat (think two days old) on a plane, followed by another 2 hours in a car. I was close to vomiting during the last hour, and kept begging him silently not to move around too much. 

Especially these last couple of weeks it seems like a few of my colleagues have developed some "sweat issues". I guess they've always been that way... The thing is; I'd rather get a whiff of sweat now and then than light up a cigarette. I'd probably even do that stinking plane/car ride all over again if it meant I never had to smoke again. 

And I haven't really noticed the benefits of smelling GOOD things yet! If that isn't progress I don't know what is...  So keep at it all of you struggling in the beginning stages! It feels good to be free!

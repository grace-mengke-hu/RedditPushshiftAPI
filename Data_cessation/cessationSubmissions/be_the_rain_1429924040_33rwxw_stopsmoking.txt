I'm gunna quit smoking tomorrow.

I'm pretty committed to quit smoking tomorrow. I've been smoking for 10 years. I hate that I smell bad. I hate that I can't  run 1 block if my life depended in it. I hate that I NEED to have a cigarette when I drive to work, talk on the phone, listen to music, browse reddit, take a break at work, and pretty much any other activity you can think of!.!. My husband hates that I smell like cigarettes all the time. I still don't see my self as a smoker (if that makes and sense). As I rite this,  I'm smoking my last cigarette! I guess I just hope that tomorrow, or rite now, I can really not smoke again! !

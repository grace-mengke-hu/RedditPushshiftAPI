Relaxing..

Hardest thing for me when being without is that I cant find a way to have same relaxing moments as when I smoke. Going to balcony to cool off is one of my favorite moments in a day. Waking up to it and doing it last thing at night. Just sitting there feels dumb, taking coffee or tea and trying to enjoy it outside doesn't feel that good either just makes me want to smoke or get back inside. Anyone relate and found alternative? This problem made me start again after a year :/

Quitting vaping is hard.

I have no support on or offline.

Vapers around you tell you that nicotine itself isn't actually bad.

And that it actually has positive acute effects on your body.

They tell you that it's not carcinogenic and there is no point of quitting.

And it's not like quitting cigarettes where you actually feel your body get better over time.

I'm almost a week in and I just feel miserable, irritable, and I'm actively doing worse in every activity I partake in.

I'm so closed minded, easily angered, and mentally handicapped right now. I can't even write a proper post with coherent sentences.

I don't think I've ever written something as pointless and jumbled up as this post. UGH.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to vent a little bit.

Thank you

Yesterday I posted that I was craving a cigarette and asked; Why am I doing this. One reply was from somebody who is going in for radiation therapy tomorrow. That helped. I red this sub a few more times yesterday and today I'm feeling fine and my flair has reached double digits. Thanks for all your stories.

Totally forgot about counter. *SUCCESS*

I just looked here for the first time in awhile, 242 days?! Several months ago, I forgot I ever smoked, or ever got a badge. Thanks for 242 smoke free days, /r/stopsmoking. Imma forget I was here again now.  Keep up the good work everyone else, you WILL feel better and have a buttload more cash in your pockets, just like everyone says. Oh, the smells.  

IMO, when you forget you have a badge is when you know you've won.

All It Took Was One Question...

As a kid I got my grandma to quit smoking after 20 some-odd years of smoking, just by asking her. 

When I was 5, this is how the conversation went:



Me:  Grandma!

Grandma:  Hi kiddo!

Me:  Can I ask you something?

Grandma:  Sure

Me:  Can you stop smoking?  I don’t want you to die.

Grandma:  Aww, Okay honey.  *Hugs Me*

Grandma:  *Smoked her last cigarette that day and left the remaining pack on the dresser never to be touched again*



She’s still nicotine-free ‘til this day...



I didn’t know she would actually quit for good, but I hoped she would.  I’m not a smoker but I wanted to lend support to those who are and are trying to quit.  

While I realize going cold turkey is not ideal for some, the moral of the story is that you can do it if you believe in yourself.  Especially if someone else believes in you.

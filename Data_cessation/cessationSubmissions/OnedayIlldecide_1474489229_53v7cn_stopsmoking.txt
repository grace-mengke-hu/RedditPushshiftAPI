Day 3

Today has been the hardest so far. I even went to the gas station then managed to talk myself into just getting a drink and telling the cashier i was quitting when he asked if I wanted smokes. 

My sister and husband want to be supportive but neither of them know how. And I don't know what to tell them. So nobody mentions it. Which puts me in a position of "well nobody will know if I don't tell them"

But I feel like I'm alone in this. My sister had her last one yesterday but I don't want to ask how she's doing because, history has shown that together we will rationalize buying a new pack. "well its just one pack for the two of us. and we'll ration it out. we're still quiting right?" So I don't want to go down that road again.

My husband thinks that being patronizing and constantly showing disappointment when it's even brought up is supportive. last time I made it this far I made it to 10 days. And when I mention that I was proud of myself he would say something that I'm sure he thought was supportive but came across as "sooooo you didn't do the thing you said you wouldn't do...? ok..."

My mom has quit before so she's sympathetic when I call her crying about it being a tough day when she's sick at home from work and her throat is so sore I thought James Earl Jones picked up the phone...

IDK...I guess I just needed to rant...

Over all I feel clear headed. My temper is actually less than usual if I remember to take a deep breath. I'm breathing much better

Thanks for listening

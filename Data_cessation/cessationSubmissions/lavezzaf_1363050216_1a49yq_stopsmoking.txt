Starting now

I got hammered friday night and ended up in the hospital after a fight.  5 stitches for a busted eye brow and a black eye. Anyways im not drinking for a while and im going to try for my probably 20th time quiting in the last 15 years.  Day 1... I will make it because I am 28. Do the math. More then half my life ive been smoking. And every day I wait that ratio gets worse and worse.

I am about to embark on the journey of quitting smoking and have been prescribed Chantix by my doctor, any support/advise/experiences on quitting with/without Chantix would be much appreciated!

Hello!

As the title stated, I am about to embark on the journey of quitting smoking. I am a 27 year old male who has been smoking since I were 17-18. I first started when some of my friends were smoking around me and I would have a cigarette here and there but then the addiction set in. I have been an active smoker since early 2006.

Currently I have about 8-10 cigarettes a day, so a pack every 2 days, 3 packs a week at most.

In the past I have tried quitting and had occasional success but slowly slipped back into it depending on my environment and emotional state. I have never been suicidal but the worst off I have been was when my father committed suicide and that really spiraled me off into a life of drugs/alcohol/cigarettes etc... for a few years. Again, I was never suicidal in this time, just irresponsible and reckless with my habits.

As of January this year however, I have completely stopped drinking and now I feel that with booze out of the way, it's time to kick the cigarette bucket.

Im hoping to leverage the community within this subreddit to help fuel my motivation and to also lean to you guys for advice, experiences and stories as well as share my own if anyone asks.

So tell me, in your journey to a smoke free life, did you use Chantix to stop smoking? If so, would you mind sharing your story? Would you recommend it? If not, what methods did you use to nip this habit in the butt? (no pun intended)

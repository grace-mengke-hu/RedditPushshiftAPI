Hmmm... day 666.

666 days since I quit. Had a dream last night that I bought a pack, smoked one and then gave the rest of the pack away. But later in the dream, I still had the pack and there were only four left. I was disgusted with myself for caving in. Luckily, it was just a dream...

I wish I could say I never think about smoking, but I do. One of my sisters who quit more than 20 years ago says she sometimes feels like having one, too... sigh...

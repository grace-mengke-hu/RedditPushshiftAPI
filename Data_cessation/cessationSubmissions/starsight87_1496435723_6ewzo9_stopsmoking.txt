4 Weeks Today! Thank you to all of you :)

A big thank you to everyone in this group that has shared their advice, encouragement and their personal experience with quitting smoking. It has helped me to stay strong during the bad days and reminded me to feel grateful as things got better. Everyday I feel less and less like a smoker and I don't know if it would have been possible without this group. 

So once again, thank you and have an awesome weekend.

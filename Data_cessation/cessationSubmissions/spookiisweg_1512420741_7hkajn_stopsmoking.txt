Quick question regarding cannabis

I find cravings for nicotine are much more noticeable when high than when sober, and it feels as if it’s been forever where I haven’t mixed nicotine with weed. Have I completely fucked my self (as in whenever I smoke weed I will crave nicotine) or does this go away in a matter of weeks as well? Should I stop smoking weed because of this if this is the case?

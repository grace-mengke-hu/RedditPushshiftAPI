A little over two years...

If you've just started your journey toward quitting and think you can't make it, plenty of us here started off exactly where you are starting today. 

You're just as strong as us even if you don't think that you are. 

The benefits of quitting are worth it. If you slip, it's not the end of the world, just keep with it. It'll get easier.

Good luck!

I want to quit despite everything (ignore my badge it's always a lie)

So I quit smoking in 2011 for 6 months, god damn I miss that. I didn't know how awesome it was until I started smoking again in early 2012.. I COULD BREATHE!

I've spent the better part of late 2012 and this year quitting smoking and failing, and I'm so sick of it. 
Excuses are the name of the game. I battle with general anxiety disorder and depression and my doctors tell me to not stress and that quitting smoking will come in time. My ex helped me quit for 2 months, and then our breakup caused me to relapse. 

I'm so sick of this bullshit controlling my life, and feeling like smoking dictates the people I hang around with.

I have one more broken cig in the pack that I've patched together and am smoking as we speak, and I really want this to be the end of it all. 

Fuck anxiety. Fuck life's stressors. I need to stop making excuses. 

I read halfway through "the book", I should probably finish it. I don't expect it to be a miracle, but I do need to cut the bullshit and start dealing with my addiction and it's repercussions.
BAH.

*edit for formatting, oh and I'm gonna have to go to a food bank this week because I've been choosing cigarettes over groceries.. this HAS to end.

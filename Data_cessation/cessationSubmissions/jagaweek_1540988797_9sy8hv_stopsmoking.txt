Nicotine patch to reduce smoking ?

I am 21 years old and i have been smoking since i was 14. I wasn't smoking too much until i started going to university.

The last 2 years i have been smoking 2 packs a day.  I want to reduce the amount that i smoke. And i have been using nicotine patches to help me with that.

Tomorrow it will be my 2nd week on the nicotine patch. But during those 2 weeks i smoked nearly a pack each day and didn't feel any side effects or symptoms of an overdose. (To be honest i didn't think it would be a problem combining the patch and smoking but today i saw on the internet that i shouldn't use them together)  (BTW the patches were step-1 25mg)

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to use a lower dosage nicotine patch and still smoke. But smoke less.

(BTW i feel kind of bad to ask this on a 'stop'smoking sub reddit. It's just that 7 days a week i have to study. I am prepping for a medical residency exam. For those in the US, it is the equivalent to USMLE, and smoking is one of my biggest outlets)

For those trying to quit, i give you my best wishes!

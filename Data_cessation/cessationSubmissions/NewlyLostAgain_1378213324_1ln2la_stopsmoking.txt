Relapsed, but today is the day!

About 2 months ago I tried to quit, but after 3 days I caved.  I was so angry and ashamed.  Last month, I set a goal to cut down and quit by my birthday (which is today).  Im doing quite well so far, as by now I'd have smoked about 3 cigs.  I dont want to let this stupid habit control my life anymore.  In essence, Im giving myself the gift of good health and non-dependence for my birthday.  Wish me luck guys!

Quitting dip

I know it is not smoking but man it is still tough.  When I was 15 I started diping (Grizzly Straight) and have been doing about a can a day or a more for 8 1/2 years. Copenhagen long-cut and black are my two choices. I even picked up smoking in Afghanistan for about year but managed to quit that easy.
I took my last dip just over 72 hours ago and it fing sucks.  I have been through like half a bag of jolly ranches and so much gum.  I started having trouble sleeping last night and I haven't slept yet tonight.  I even get hot flashes when a big urge hits.  I had no idea my body was relying so much on nicotine.
I decided not to chew the gum or do the patches, I want to just quit.  Besides the jolly ranchers, gum, and that fake jerky dip what else is there?  When will my urges finally go away?  It is helping having family and friend support though.

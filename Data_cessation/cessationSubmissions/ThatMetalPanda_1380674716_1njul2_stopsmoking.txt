Anybody here use vapes as an alternative?

I quit cold turkey the day before Valentine's day, with minimal problems. The biggest one though was the hand-to-mouth motion of smoking, which I couldn't find a proper replacement for. A few weeks ago, my fiance and I got some vapes when we were in California, and I love [this thing.](http://i.imgur.com/DlmXYfg.jpg) Flavored vapor with zero nicotine, and there are no long-term effects (that I've heard of so far, anyway). Plus, I can taste Mountain Dew again! Drinking it gives me insane gut rot, but the vapor tastes exactly like it and I'm happy with it all the way around. Anyone else do this?

the battle begins. quitting smoking after 14 years. tired of being chained up to it.

14 years?! I can't believe that's how long I've done this
to my body.
Or how many times I told myself I had plenty of time to quit.
Other excuses, as years have rolled on. 
I was even in the hospital room and watched my granny,
who was my world, take her last breath from emphysema, 12 years ago, and here I've still been at it.

I'm ready to quit. Just decided, one short hour ago. 
For me, for my kids, I want to be around, be healthy and strong for them.

Ive been exercising again for last couple weeks, getting started on better habits that i hope will help me power
through. 

Best wishes to everyone in their quitting journey.

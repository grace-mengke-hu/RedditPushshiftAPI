28 days YAY

I really can't remember the last time I went 28 days w/o a cigarette.  Maybe in 2007 or 2008.   I wasn't sure I'd be able to.   To anyone struggling: it gets easier.  It gets harder. It goes up and down. 
I still have cravings, but I know they are mental now. I'm determined to not give in to that, I am stronger than that! Sometimes I don't have any one day, and many the next. 
The only thing that sucks though, is I can smell it in my apartment when I come home from work or away .... I've NEVER smoked in my place. Only outside. Gross. Good thing I'm moving in a month, and will deem the new place a smoke free zone. :)

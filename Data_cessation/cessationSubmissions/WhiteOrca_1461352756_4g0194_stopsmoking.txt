Ever since I switched to a weaker cigarette I've had a nonstop headache

In my efforts to quit smoking I switched from smoking light blue American spirits to Marlboro 27s because the 27s are cheaper, a lot smoother, and don't give me nearly as much of a buzz.  I'm thinking that if I enjoy smoking less then it'll be easier for me to smoke less, but anyways, ever since I switched to 27s a few days ago I've had a nonstop headache the whole time.  Could this be nicotine withdrawal because the weaker cigarettes don't give me as much nicotine as I'm used to?

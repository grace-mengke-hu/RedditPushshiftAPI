I've quit cigarettes...BUT!

So I've been cigarette free for a couple months now. Butttt I've been smoking Al Capone's cigarillos, about 1-2 a day, for the last two - three weeks.  The patch doesn't help curve the cravings for these, don't know why. Any ideas how to quit these too?? These have been my stress crutch for sometime now.

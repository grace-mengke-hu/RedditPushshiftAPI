Relapsed. Feeling depressed, sick, and like I'm unable to quit again

During my last quit (after reading Carr) I flirted with slips, and would go right back on the horse. But then the last slip became full blown relapse. I've been smoking again for two weeks, right back at my old levels, and I'm miserable. I feel sick all the time. I really miss how I felt as a non-smoker but the momentum of that last quit is gone. I've forgotten how the hell I woke up and didn't smoke. More then anything I want that motivation back. Every morning I light up and beat myself up. I fucking hate cigarettes. This whole process has made me miserable and I'm tired of it. I don't want to do this shit anymore.

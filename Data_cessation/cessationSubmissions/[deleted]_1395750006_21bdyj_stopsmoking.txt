13yr smoker. day 4 no cig. Could use encouragement.

I'm 31.  Since I was 18, I've smoked about 9 cigs a day.  4 days ago I decided I needed to man up and quit. So far, so good.  Its been hard so I could use some encouragement.  Any quotes, stories, things that helped you, how you've felt since you've quit (health improved?) Literally anything you want to share. Thanks!

Edit #1 3/26 : Started day 5 today.  Feeling good.  Still slightly craving a cig every few hours but i really feel like i turned the corner.  I already have more energy and feel less disgusting lol. Really appreciate all the super awesome people who left me a comment. You've given me strength when I had none.  Thank you!

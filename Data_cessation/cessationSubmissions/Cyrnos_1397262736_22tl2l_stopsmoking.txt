What do you do to fill the time?

Since stopping, I've noticed that I have so much spare time now. That kind of drove me crazy to begin with because all I wanted to do when I was doing nothing was smoke. 

But I took up cross-stitching and made myself a bookmark and I've been reading and doing sudoku to fill up those 5-10 minute intervals. 

So, what do you do to keep your idle hands busy?

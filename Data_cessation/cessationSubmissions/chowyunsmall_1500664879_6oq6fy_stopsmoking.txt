Triggering cravings or bolstering determination?

Hey guys! I'm 88 days into quitting, nearly 3 months! Quick question for the community on avoiding cravings, and this sub!

This is my first and only time quitting so far, after smoking for 13 years. I started following this sub a few weeks after I started. 

As many people have said here, my physical cravings went pretty quickly, surprisingly so, because they were just awful the first week. Now it's just the psychological ones.

I feel great to not be beholden to the habit. And one tool that I love is going on the Smoke Free app pretty regularly, looking at the days and giving myself a pat on the back. It's been THAT long! YES!

I've enjoyed reading about other people's journeys on here! What I like about this sub is the sense of community and support and hearing about the experiences of others I can relate to. But a few times I've felt like seeing posts have triggered cravings. It feels like (perhaps a wrong perception) that my cravings are more when I'm on reddit and seeing these posts.

I'll see a post title like 'ahhh I want a cigarette!!!!'  Or read one that says - I quit and then I gave in and I smoked a million at a party, the campfire and drinking was too much!!! I'm back on the wagon now, here I go!'

And I think - 'Oh yeah, cigarettes. God I loved cigarettes.' I'm shocked that I'm not thinking about them, but I find myself forgetting about them.

And I guess that's the thing for me: I am super glad I quit and I don't want to smell or cough or get cancer or feel unhealthy or spend the money or be a smoker. 

But I did really love the act of smoking. Like a lot. Like I'm triggering myself just writing about it. And I'm worried I'm getting reminded and it's dangerous.

 Anyone else have this experience?  I got curious if anyone else has thoughts about smoking reminders.

Thanks!!

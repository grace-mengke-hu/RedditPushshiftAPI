Over 2 years smoke free and currently struggling more now than ever

Like the title says it’s been over 2 years since I quit smoking but the last 2-3 months have been insanely difficult. I’m having crazy stress dreams and basically crave cigarettes 24/7. This has never been a problem until recently and I just don’t know what to do. Craving them is making me even more anxious because I’m worried I’m going to crack soon!

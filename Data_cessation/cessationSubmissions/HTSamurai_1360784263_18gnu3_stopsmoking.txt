ok r/stopsmoking, a confession and a question

I didn't quit for myself. I didn't quit because I wanted to, in fact I'd love a cigarette right now after two months of not having had one. If offered one with no one around I'd have a hard time turning it down, but I would. I quit because it was beneficial to my relationship with my mom and close friends. Because they wanted me to, also, though to a lesser extent, because it's nice not waking up dying of a cough and phlegm (IE: my health). 
However now I'm just over the two month mark, last thursday being the two month anniversary. I have to admit, I want to stay quit. I don't want to die of something smoking-related. a while back I had a really bad episode of heart palpitations where I was sure I was gonna die, turns out 6 hours of sleep over 48 hours, 6 rockstars and a pack and a half of red 100s isn't a good life choice....I don't want to go back to that. 
So now I'm resolved to stay a non-smoker. I could walk to the 7-11 down the street right now, I've got $10 in my pocket, I could go get a pack and a bag of chips and be happy for a while and then hate myself afterwards. Not going to do it. 
So my question is, is there a way to get a 2 month badge? or do I have to start from the beginning, badge-wise? I'd understand but I'd really like to have the 2month one :/

Smoked my last cigarette this morning, any tips advice or encouragement would be extremely helpful!

I'm 26, been smoking for almost a decade and finally came to the realisation that I'm not going to continue paying somebody else to kill me.
Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated as far as apps or plans. I've tried to quit in the past with gum and patches, currently gonna try the mini lozenges.

Day 3 not smoking - spent the day around a smoker and didn’t cave!

Today is Day 3 of not smoking and today has been quite tough. So far I have not had to deal with having cigarettes within reach but today my dad came to my house and he’s a big smoker, I knew I could bum a fag off him at anytime. Despite this, I did not smoke!

I’ve been feeling a bit down today, I wont lie. Didn’t really go out and spent quite a bit of time laying in my bed on my phone. I have just yawned all day and also have had a bad day eating-wise and I’m trying to lose weight. I’m feeling guilty right now for being so lazy/eating too much but I’m trying to tell myself “but you didn’t smoke and that’s the important thing”. I am far too hard on myself.

Also, I just want to say that alongside smoking I have, totally unplanned, also given up coffee! Coffee and cigs have been my vice for the last 10 years, I would not eat until 2pm but have wayyyy too many cups of coffee to keep me energised. I said to my husband “I want to give up them both but not at the same time, it’ll be too much”. Well funnily enough since stopping smoking on Monday I just really can’t stomach having a coffee! I’m hoping this helps my anxiety

I got the flu and haven't smoked for 13 days behind it

I caught a nice juicy case of Influenza A on the 2nd of January. I tried so HARD to smoke while I was sick but it hurt my chest and throat and I just couldn't do it. It's been a disgusting habit and not many things would keep me from smoking. When I was in the thick of it, I had a gnarly fever (100+) and couldn't go outside to smoke. Who knew the flu was going to be what helped me quit.  


I attempted to quit for real once before this. After smoking being such a huge stress reliever and smoking for 11 years, it made me feel like it was the cool part of my density. Before, I made it only 2 days.  I went to the gas station, ashamed, and bought another pack. I picked it right back up without question. That was in October of 2018.   


I did not plan on trying to quit again after that. My dad quit cold turkey after 30+ years of smoking. He just made his year mark smoke free and we are so proud of each other. It's good to have someone on the journey with you.  


I don't know what the point of this post is, but it made me feel better to write it out. I'm 13 days smoke free and I'm so DAMN proud of myself. I never thought I would ever make it this far. I love smoking. I never wanted to stop. I'm definitely going to have one on my death bed, 100%. But for now, we're doing it. Not one puff.

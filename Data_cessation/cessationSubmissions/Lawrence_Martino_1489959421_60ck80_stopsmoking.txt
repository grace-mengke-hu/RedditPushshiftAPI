Side effects of quitting

Stopped smoking cigarettes about two months ago. Stopped smoking pot two weeks ago. Completely cut out all substances from my life. Now it feels like my throat is more messed up than it was when I was smoking. My lymph nodes are swollen. My tonsils are swollen. Figured it would be all daisies and rainbows once I quit and admittedly this is quite the kick in the dick. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Starting to worry that I should see a doctor...

I have set my quit date. I want to document everything. What should I track?

Greetings Reddit. In the past you have helped me do many things like curb my gaming addictions, get focused, and now it's time for me to quit smoking (for good if you still see my 299 badge). I know the different methods, like patches, gum, and even have a really expensive e-cigarette, but nothing has worked for me. I feel the only success I have had in the past was by just not doing anything nicotine related. 

There is more to this than me, I want to help out the future person like me not smoke in the first place or prepare themselves for the battle. Here is a little history on my smoking [Link](http://www.skewd.com/documentaries/im-quitting-smoking-documenting-everything/)

I would like to know what was missing when you tried quitting that you wished you would have had more information on. What was missing in your journey.

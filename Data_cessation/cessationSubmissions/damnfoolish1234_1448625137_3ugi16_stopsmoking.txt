Secret smoker - I've been damn foolish

Christ, where to start?  I smoked from when I was 18 to 30, then successfully used the Carr EasyWay to quit.  Easy-peasy!  Till I was 36..

Then I moved abroad.  New friends, new job, stress stress start smoking again.  Idiot!   Meet my future wife  - she doesn't like me smoking and neither do I and I - with more difficulty - quit again.

Then we move back to the home country.  New job, stress etc, start smoking - but in secret.  My wife found out once and was hurt and upset, and I quit, but months later edged back in to it.  My work colleagues know (and are smokers themselves), but my wife and friends don't.   And I *have to quit* - I hate it, I quit every weekend, I choke, I cry, it's horrible, but I have the 'secret smoking' thing down pat - I wash, I have mints, I change my shirt - and I can successfully (it appears) lie.  But I don't to myself call it a lie, since I never *actively* tell an untruth - I just leave out the bit of my life where I need the most support, because I'm so ashamed of it all.  But I know it is.

I've quit for good now.  Yesterday.  And it's going fine!  I *know* how easy it can be with the right mindset - the cravings are easy, the habit purely mental, and in 3 days or so there are no physical symptoms to (trivially) overcome, but I'm so scared.  Scared that because it's all secret, and I've kept it all secret, I'm so on my own.  I've quit so many times before and gone back - and it's so easy since i don't need to explain myself.

So that's why I'm posting here - I think I need a bit of support, a bit of encouragement, a bit of spine and moral backbone.  

Thanks for reading!

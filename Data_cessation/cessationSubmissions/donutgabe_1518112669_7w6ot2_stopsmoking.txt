What community or healthcare resources do you wish existed?

I'm working on developing a research project with a major university aimed at helping people lead healthier lives.  Hospitals, clinics and community centers put a lot of effort into helping people quit smoking.  Sometimes their efforts are misguided or ineffective.  You are experts on this subject.  What do you think these organizations could do better?  What services or resources could they provide to help people who smoke to cut down or quit?

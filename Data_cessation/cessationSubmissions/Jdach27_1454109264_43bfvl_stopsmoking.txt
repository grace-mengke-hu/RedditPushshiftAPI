First tattoo

I've always wanted a tattoo, but I never felt I had good enough reason. I would find a design I liked, and then just debate back and forth about it and would just never get it. Three nights ago I had an idea. I still wanted it the next morning, so I went for it. Totally unlike me. I normally would have spent weeks working on the design and finding the right artist. But I just walked into a place (I at least went to a highly rated shop) and was in the chair 20 minutes later.

It's the number 27, done so it looks the same upside down. 27 has always been my favorite number, and I was born on the 27th day of the month. I'm 27 years old currently, and this has been a big year for me. I'm finally getting my shit together like I told myself I would do when I was 25 (better late than never I guess). I started my own business that's already in the black, and I started actually taking care of my mental health. 

The thing I'm most proud of though is that I quit smoking. I never thought I had the self control or willpower to do it before. It really makes anything feel possible. I know I'm only a little over three weeks in, but I've quit countless times before, and this time is different.  This is the first time I've truly quit for myself, and it makes a huge difference. I laugh at the idea of wanting a cigarette.  Thank you to everyone on this sub for your stories and encouragement, it's such a positive place. 

For the first time in my life, I'm actually proud where my life is heading. I wanted to remember this turning point. Definitely happy that I got it. And it wasn't the purpose, but as a bonus the tattoo is a really good reminder to never have a single puff ever again. 

**TL;DR** I quit smoking and did other stuff so I got a tattoo

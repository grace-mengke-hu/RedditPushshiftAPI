My quit date is coming up and I could use some motivation

Hi everyone, I'm an 18 year old high school senior who's been smoking for about 2 and a half years. I've decided that I'm going to start my quit journey on Saturday, and could use some motivational comments to look back on when it gets tough. I still live with my mother, who is a smoker, so I'm going to try and stay in my room or out of the house as much as I can for the first week or so. Thanks, I really appreciate It!

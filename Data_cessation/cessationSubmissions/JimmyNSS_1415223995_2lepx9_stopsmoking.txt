Halfway through day 2. Greetings fellow quitters!

I strongly recommend Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Amazon has it for $7.69 for Kindle which you can also read on Android phones and tablets and I believe the same is true for iPhone/iPad. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to get it but that's how I got it.

The book tells you not to quit until you've read the whole thing but I'm halfway through and it's already convinced me. I use it as motivation to keep going when it get's hard. It's a great way to focus on why I don't want to smoke instead of why I do. 

Since I have it on my phone I have quick access to it anytime.

I'm only on day 2 but I made it through 2 work shifts without lighting up. I'm excited to get to 72 hours so it's out of my system completely. I'm excited to start looking better and feeling better and knowing I'm making my best effort to living a long time.

Here is some info on the first 72 hours:

Wish me luck.
Good luck to you!

Amazing how I still crave it after exercise

What an amazing addiction. I went for my first run in probably over a year and I felt old as fuck (i'm 25). Coughing, no breath, felt like puking the entire time, my heart was racing... As I ran, i told myself "wow, cigarretes are fucking you up, Why even smoke if you feel like this?". 20 minutes later, i'm smoking. I really " needed" it. I have no control whatsoever, but I reaaaaaly want to stop :(

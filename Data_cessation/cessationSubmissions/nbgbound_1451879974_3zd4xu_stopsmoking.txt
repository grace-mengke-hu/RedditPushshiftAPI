Help! Less than 24 hours and I relapsed.

Hi, I have been a smoker for 7 years and never actually tried to quit. In the past few days, I started reading Allen Carr's easyway and decided I am quitting. 
Today I didn't smoke any cigarette, enjoyed fighting the pangs throughout the day until my mind tricked me that I am using the will power method of quitting that Easyway warned me against. I bought a pack and smoked 3 cigarettes in less than an hour. The relapse made me feel so bad and pathetic. Should I read the book again? I feel certain it works and I have never wanted to REALLY quit before this, or should I just set another final cigarette and start again tomorrow?

Attempt #123456

I am now on day 6 of no smoking. I have been playing this game for a while of quitting for a week, starting up again, rinse, and repeat. This most recent time I have quit because I got bronchitis...again. My lungs hurt like hell....and I realized I will keep having this cycle happen. My mom has smokes for 40 years and gets bronchitis every other month. I don't want to be like that. I don't even want one right now honestly,  but I am still on the mend. I know once I feel better, once I'm out having a drink, once I'm in that social situation I will want one. But today I don't and thats what I will focus on. Those of you on here who have quit, thank you for the motivation and your stories. One day at a time!

Today marks the first twenty four hours of smoking cessation.

After numerous attempts at quitting smoking, along with the persistent back of mind mind fear that cancer is looming, I've decided to finally start considering myself a non smoker. 

My wake up call was taking my third smoke break of the day and feeling the familiar dull pain of my esophagus. Trigger inner monologue of my mortality and leaving all of my loved ones behind. Another person who fell victim to tobacco related illness despite all of the easily accessible information of the detrimental effects on my health. 

Upon going back into work and expressing my desire to quit smoking my coworker actually said something that rattled my cage; "Aren't you scared?"

That sentence alone brought reality immediately into the forefront... Yes, in fact, I am pretty scared of the potential risks. So, with that, I smoked my last cigarette and have managed to abstain for over twenty four hours thus far. 


I'm posting here as essentially a crap shoot. Hoping that being an active member of this community will help with the process. 

Thanks!

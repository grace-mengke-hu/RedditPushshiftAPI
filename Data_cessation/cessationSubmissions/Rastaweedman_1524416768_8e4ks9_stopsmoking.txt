Stop smoking cigs but not weed?

Hey everyone, first actual post on Reddit and it's gonna be here. 

Excuse me in advance for any mistakes, English isn't my first language.

So I've started smoking 5 years ago 5-6 cigs a day. A pack if partying was involved. But I started with smoking weed wich lead me to smoking cig. 

Now after 5 years I want to stop cigarette but not the weed (planing on buying a vaporizer and everything) 

But I can't just smoke pure weed so I was thinking of doing some kind of mix with other herbs to add to my joints. 
I've seen mix like this in coffee shop in Amsterdam and I was thinking of doing the same. 

Anyone has the same issue? Or anyone who smoke weed that use this kind of mix? 

Any advice will be appreciated anyway. If this isn't the good place to post I'm sorry.

*TL;DR* I smoke weed and cig. I want to stop cigarette. Searching for herbs to mix with the weed like in Amsterdam.

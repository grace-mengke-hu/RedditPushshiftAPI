Smoke Free since 1 Month

It has been 1 month that I am smoke free. 
I would like to share my personal experience to help other people to stop smoking. 
The first 3 days are very difficult but nothing is impossible ( I believe that the word impossible should not exist ) You can manage to overpass them like I did. 
The must important thing is to convince yourself that you have to stop smoking. The mental aspect is much more important than the physical one! 
After 3 days it is very easy to stay smoke free although u are much likely to suffer from nicotine withdrawal side effects ( Nausea, Headache , anxiety etc...)
! Good luck !

53 days in, I'm having a slightly unusual problem. Hoping you can help me figure out if it's a concern.

A few weeks ago I made a post about running a 7-minute mile, a personal best for me in years. Since then, it has gone *way* downhill. I am very often short of breath, and when I run my heart often skips a beat and/or beats pretty hard, forcing me to start walking again.

Here's the thing though, when I ran that 7-minute mile, it was 80 degrees out and at night. Now when I run it is 90-95 degrees and during the day.

Here's the other thing, after I *do* workout (it's not much, just walking/jogging for 30 minutes then some body weight exercises) It's almost perfectly easy to breath for 3-4 hours.

What do you think? Should I worry? Please don't say "just see a doctor." I'm poor and already in debt for going to the doctor when I didn't need to. I'm hoping for someones anecdotal experience, or the advice of someone who has been finished smoking for much longer than I have

Thank you all!

Still doing well after more than a year now.

I haven't checked in for a while, but I'm still an ex-smoker and couldn't be happier about it.  I still get a craving once in a while.  I still have smoking dreams where I wake up upset with myself for caving in.  I don't cough all the time any longer, which is huge for me.

If you have just quit, hang in there.  You can do it.  It gets easier.

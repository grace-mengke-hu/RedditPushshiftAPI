20 days and going strong

I proudly made it to 20 days without smoking (cold turkey) wich is a huge acomplishment for me, however i'm afraid it won't get easier mentally, i still really miss the tought of smoking. Also the fact that smoking was really usefull to me when getting to know or bonding with people at parties and stuff...

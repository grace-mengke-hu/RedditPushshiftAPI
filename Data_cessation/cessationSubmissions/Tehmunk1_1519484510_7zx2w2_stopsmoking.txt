Never a good time to quit(long)

I’ve had many talks with people about waiting for the perfect time to quit. Like when there isn’t a million stressful things happening in your life. I work in retail and I managed to quit smoking 3 days after Black Friday. The most chaotic time of the year for almost any business let alone major box store employees. I smoked for almost 13 years and have been wanting to quit for probably the last 5 if not more. 

I’m not sure what made me actually quit,’I kind of just woke up one morning realized that there is no perfect day to decide to quit, it’s gonna suck no matter what. I coughed so hard I almost threw up. Then I went straight to my kitchen and tossed my pack and haven’t looked back. 

I still dream about having another cigarette, I even thought about having one to honor a friend that passed away. But I realized that all I was doing was trying to bargain with myself to give in and just “have one, it’s not a big deal.” But it is. Anyways, stay strong out there guys, don’t beat yourself up if you fall off the wagon, just remember to get up and back on it.

2 weeks totally nicotine free!

I'm feeling good about this.  Even though I've quit many times for longer periods.  Last time I quit I was vaping and this time I decided I just had to get rid of all the associations.  Plus my lungs are not feeling great and asthma is an issue so vaping seemed like a bad idea.  

I'm having some cravings and a lot of restlessness and angst.  But tonight I made chocolate cake and decaf coffee and decided to reward myself with a nice homemade dessert for 2 weeks of success.  Next goal:  3 weeks!

Can I give some advice, if you've never tried it? Muslim Fasting.

Now hear me out. 

I'm a muslim. Do you know about ramadan? We fast from sun up to sun down. It's hard in the summer (esepcially in canada where the sun sets at like 9:30 and comes up again at 4:00). 

So during this time, no eating, drinknig, sex, smoking. And you gotta try to be patient, kind, honest, forgiving, not swear and all that. 

So I had a tough time this summer and I am making it up right now in the winter since the days are shorter. 

And I am a 10-15 a day smoker. Since I can't have my first one till at least 4:30, it usually means I only have 3 that entire day. 

It also reduced the habit and craving pretty significantly. 

Just thought it might help someone who has been having a tough time. It also strengthens your will power. If you could resist food and drink for 8 hours (and nicotine) then surely the next time you go to light up, you might consider it more closely.

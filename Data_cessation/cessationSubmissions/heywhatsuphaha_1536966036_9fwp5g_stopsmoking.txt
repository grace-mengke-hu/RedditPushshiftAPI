Heavy head feeling even while using e-cigarette

so i quit tobacco about 2-3 days ago. Since then I've been using an e-cigarette with nicotine. It does help, but today I just felt like shit. I couldn't get up to really do anything except go for a walk. Just laid in bed, drank water, had a meal. I feel really tired in my head...it feels like theres an extra weight there, a foggy feeling. I feel lonely too. Don't get me wrong, I feel the health advantages already...and I will remain dedicated... I guess I just want someone to tell me it'll be ok :/

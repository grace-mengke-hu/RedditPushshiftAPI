3 and a half days and going strong! Thanks for the support everyone!

Some of you may consider this as cheating but I have tried cold turkey and that didn't work. E-cigs didn't work and I had a lot of faith in them. My strategy that is working for me is to have a can of dip. I know I know I'm still putting nicotine into my body but hear me out. I smoked over a pack a day easily and now I can make it all day no problem but it's when I get home from work after working out and after dinner that I really get cravings. I can throw one dip in a day for an hour and not think about a single cigarette at all. It may not be the smartest way to quit but I certainly don't enjoy dipping so I am very confident that not buying another can after this one will be no problem. I am using it as a crutch to get me through this first week and it is the only thing that has kept me away from cigarettes. Looking forward to seeing that star badge in my future as I have been a pack a day smoker for about 7 years! Thanks again for all of the motivation!

19 Days already? Wooooh!

Stopped smoking 19 Days ago with "cold turkey"-strategy and it worked just fine. The second day non-smoking was the worst, after that its been relatively easy and I only struggle to not smoke when I'm really drunk, but my friends all help me here!

Biggest victory yet: Some Oktoberfest visits and NO cigarette :)! This is a huge success

Thank you everybody for your encouraging stories, it really helps

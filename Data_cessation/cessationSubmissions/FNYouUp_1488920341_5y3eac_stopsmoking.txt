I really want to stop, but I'm afraid I won't know how...

I have smoked for 10+ years and I so badly want to quit. I have been doing tons of research about Chantix, hypnosios, nicotine replacement therapy, and other options. But there's a part of me that says quitting is too difficult. That making a life change at this pint is almost impossible. I do not know how to get this negativity out of my mind. It's making my life unmanageable. 

The hypnosis is very expensive, the Chantix has insane side effects, and the nicotine replacement therapy is just like substituting addictions.

I'm at a loss...

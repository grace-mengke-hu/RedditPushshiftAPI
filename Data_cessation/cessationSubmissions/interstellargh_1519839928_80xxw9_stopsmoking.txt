Day 19, still proud, but the obsession with not-smoking is waning.

I was a ~3/day secret smoker for 10ish years. I wish I could hold onto the high from reading (listening to) Allen Carr's book for the first time. It had such an impact on me for the first 10 days of my quit. Also, I kind of loved quitter's flu. But now the high and the "flu" are gone, week 3 without cigarettes is comign to an end, and its becoming more of a routine. Not a bad thing-- just a thing.

Here is a random list of thoughts:

* My skin is like, good and looking healthy, but its not like pERFECT BEAUTIFUL MAGICAL SKIN that i thought i'd have by now

* I freaking love not smelling cigarettes on my own person. That smell lingered, gave my "secret smoker" status away, probably. My hair just smells like shampoo. Some clothes (jackets, cardigans) that I don't wash that regularly smell like cigarettes, when I pull them out of my closet now. I can't believe I thought I could hide my smoking. I smelled.

* I really quit for mental health reasons, to try and stop my anxious thoughts from spiraling. The fact that this has worked literally makes me burst into tears. I have anxious thoughts still, but for the first time in a decade, those anxious thoughts just float away. I don't grab hold of them and make them my life anymore. I feel like my brain is changing and I have this opportunity to be a different, happier, healthier person.

* My quitters flu lasted from like day 6 to day 12, or something. It went away. I still am blowing my nose a lot but ultimately don't consider myself feeling sick anymore. 

* I cannot stop eating. 

* I have become the most productive person in the world. I started this ongoing to-do list of projects both big and small, regular responsibilities and wishlist kind of stuff, and I am checking them off faster than adding them. The other day I cleaned my room, took 3 bags of clothes to donation, filled 3 bags with stuff to toss, 1 bag of stuff to sell. I rearranged all the furniture in my room and cleaned all surfaces. I moved a piece of furniture into the other room to serve as a bar cart, which I've always wanted. I went for a 3 mile run. I bought groceries. Cleaned my fridge and freezer. Made myself dinner. Finished a book. Started a new book and read 100 pages while enjoying a cocktail. This was a Monday. I was so proud of myself! This is so different than my usual routine of: lay around all morning, have a cigarette and be stressed, lay back in bed and be stressed maybe watch a TV, have another cigaretet, change into workout clothes but don't workout, have another cigarette, be stressed and anxious.

* I do still smoke (vape) weed and its helped a lot with encouraging mellowing out at night. The other night I got a little baked and just started fantasizing about the future, which is one of my favorite hobbies lol. For the first time I stopped fantasizing about a relationship-- that's normally my "go to" fantasy. Instead, I fantasized about having my own home, I had a garden, some kind of pet. I wore lightweight dress, barefoot in a yard. My body was thin and strong from yoga and running. My hair was longer and in braids. I just fantasized about what my future could look like, and it was so peaceful, calm, and bright. I'm pretty excited to make that my reality :D

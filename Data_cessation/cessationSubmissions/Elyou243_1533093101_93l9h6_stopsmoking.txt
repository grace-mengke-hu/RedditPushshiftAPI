Two weeks in, when does it start getting easier?

I've been on vacation for two weeks abroad, i thought it would be a good time to quit since I won't have any of my usual smoking triggers, etc. 

I'm coming home in a week and I still have a lot of cravings everyday, and that's without any triggers other than being full after eating or seeing someone else smoke, I'm really scared I'll relapse when I'm back home.

Just trying to vent, thanks for anyone that read all the way

Zero cigarettes today and it's hard?

18 hours since my last cigarette. I'm dying of tiredness and boredom at work. I'm using chewing gum as a distraction to help me not think of nicotine products or cigarettes. I'm so tired that I feel "cross eyed" and can't even drive correctly....double vision, anxious, irritated, constipated, miserable. But I will not falter. I'm gonna stick to it. By god, I can't be wasting my dollars on these cancer sticks anymore. If I slip up this week, I'm gonna get some Zero nicotine ejuice for my old E-cig set up and try again. I don't wanna use any nicotine products cuz all those do is make me waste money and time and I usually just relapse. How's everyone else's progress so far?

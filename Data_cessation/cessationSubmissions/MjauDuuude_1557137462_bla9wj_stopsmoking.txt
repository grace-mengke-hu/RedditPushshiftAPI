I can’t handle quitting and I desperately need advice.

I’m 28 years old and I’ve been a smoker since I was 14.
Since then I’ve coped with every feeling and situation, both positive and negative, with cigarettes. 
I have ADD and generalised anxiety disorder, which means that I’m constantly anxious and restless, no matter what I do (I’ve tried all possible medications that are available in Sweden and none of them work). Cigarettes are a way for me to cope with life, to be able to live a fairly normal life and get through all struggles from day to day.

I don’t want to be a smoker anymore. 
Quitting would improve my life so much in theory, both with health and economy. The pros are so many more than the cons, but the cons weigh so much heavier. 
I’ve tried to quit three times, last time was just this passed weekend. I struggle a lot but after about 8 hours it gets so much worse. 
My mind turns to self harm and suicidal thoughts, I just can’t handle it. I have been seeing a therapist for most of my adult life and have worked with myself very hard and have made some amazing progress but when it comes to smoking i just can’t handle it. I can’t cope. 
I have tried quitting cold turkey, I’ve tried to smoke less (I smoke a pack a day), but nothing works. I’m not strong enough.
I don’t know what to do, it feels so hopeless. 
Does anyone have any advice? Has someone felt the same and been able to quit? 
I desperately need help. 


TLDR; Have ADD and GAD. Can’t handle life without cigarettes. Trying to quit makes me suicidal and self destructive. I’m not strong enough to quit but I really don’t want to be a smoker anymore.

Day 96!

Well I am almost at 100 days smoke free!  For those that are just starting, trust me, the days start going by faster and faster and before you know it you will be at your own 100 days!  Keep at it!

One thing I will say though is that I still, in certain situations, really get some pretty intense cravings.  They are so f-ing annoying!  I know I will not act on them, but they seriously make me just angry that they are still popping up.  I do my best to distract myself, take deep breaths, have some water, etc but I just hate them so much.  Makes me really regret ever smoking as I worry I will continue to have these cravings for years to come.  Of course they are better than dealing with actually smoking again, but man, so frustrating!

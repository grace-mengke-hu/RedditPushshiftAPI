Day one.

So today brings about a fresh start. Its 5:15am in England. Todays my 25th birthday.  I've always said to myself that I would quit when I turned 25, I just didn't expect it to roll around so quickly. 

I just flushed my last 4 cigarettes down the toilet. My last surviving lighter was thrown into someone's garden. It feels oddly satisfying. 

I've spent the last 10 years killing myself. I've watched family members die from smoking related illnesses. It wont be easy, but I'll be dammed if I give in to temptation. 

I honestly don't know what I'm doing here. Maybe just looking for support from those that have kicked the habit. Or friends who are going through the same thing.

TL;DR : Turned 25. Stopped killing myself legally.

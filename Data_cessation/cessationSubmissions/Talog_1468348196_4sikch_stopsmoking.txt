50 days in almost went back

So i had huge cravings in the last couple of days, i could only think about getting a smoke. It is weird because i didn't get cravings for a long time,not even thinking about smoking,but this time it was different. I went on and bought a pack,considering dropping this whole thing for a while and continuing to quit a bit later. 

I smoked  2-3 cigars and all came back to me,I imagined going to a 2 pack a day or even worse would be so easy . I could see myself nervously doing some random stuff and only thinking smoking after,i could see how bad i would smell after a while,my teeth,skin,health going bad,my thoughts clarity,my energy for exercising,my precious breath and lungs.. So i dumped the pack and said to a mirror NO MORE, I am in control of myself!! And went out to meet some good friends by the pool and had a blast

I realized that i wasn't craving for a nicotine per se, but i craved for something bad to do to myself,something which can set me back and keep me going in a circle of shame,destructive thoughts and behaviours

After 32 years and 5 attempts, I’m finally a non smoker!

I’ve been reading posts on here for a couple of mo this and haven’t posted anything (I’m new to Reddit!), but thought I’d post as It’s good to have somewhere to tell people (who might be more interested than FB friends and Twitter followers) that I’ve finally kicked the habit. I started smoking properly when I was 14 - spending my school lunch money on 10 cigs and clock watching in class until break time when I could have my next cig! How awful is that! An addict when I was a child!
I tried over the years to stop but failed as I wasn’t committed to it. I tried nicotine gum, patches, inhalator, cold turkey, Champix tablets and vaping. After 6 attempts over the years, I realised I didn’t want to quit enough.
This time I wanted it more than ever - my dad has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and it’s terminal. He has 5 daughters (including me), 8 grandkids and 1 great grandkid. I don’t want my kids going through the stress and heartache that we’re going through so I’ve quit those cancer sticks. I decided to do it for good at the end of July and knew this was it. So I set a plan to make it as comfortable for me as possible. I used nicotine patches to make the physical cravings bearable while I coped with the bit I always found the hardest: the habit, the crutch, the ‘friend’, the way of life, my whole identity (it really was and partly still is which might never change).
Anyway, here’s to being a smoke free human being!

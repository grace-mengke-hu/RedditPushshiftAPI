Last Day... and I'm hopeful this one will hold true...

Hello r/stopsmoking,


I just needed a safe place to share on my last day of smoking. I'm hopeful that this time it'll truly be my last day. I had my first taste when I was 8yo... and I'm almost 39... I need to quit this shit!


For the past month, every time I had a smoke, I've been telling myself that it's nasty, that I need to quit, that I don't need it in my life. My eCig is ready and juiced up to help with cravings. I'm reading Allan Carr's book, which I will finish tonight. I started replacing my smoke breaks at work with tea breaks. I've put in place a reward system that will give me something to look forward to and keep me on track... If I last a month, I get a new TV. After that, another big reward at 2 months (possibly a PS4), and at 4 months, and at 8, etc...


My goal right now is to make it to next year; I'm finally on track for my dream trip to go to Australia next year, and I want to be completely smoke free when I go. I want to experience going on a trip where I don't have to worry about having enough smokes, being anxious about local laws and not being able to smoke... I've had enough!


I've been reading a lot of success stories on this sub for the past month or so... They've all been very inspiring; if so many people are able to make it than I figured I can to!!

Thank you for reading my rant... I just needed to get this out of my system...

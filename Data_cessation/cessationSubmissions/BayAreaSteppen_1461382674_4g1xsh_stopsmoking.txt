My dad just got diagnosed with COPD from smoking all his life.

[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease)        

He was a pipe smoker for 50 years. He just quit cold turkey, well because he has to. I've been off cigs for over a year (vaping though). Hope you all can kick the habbit before your get diagnosed this. He gets winded super easy, activities are limited. If he keeps smoking he will have to wheel around an oxygen cart everywhere he goes. Power to your struggle my friends, let us all stay quit.

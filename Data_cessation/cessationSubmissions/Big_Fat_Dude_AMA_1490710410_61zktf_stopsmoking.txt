Got the wake-up call I needed today.

I'm 19, and I've been an on-and-off smoker since I was 17. It's really picked up since I started university last September, with 8 in a day being pretty typical. 

I'd always had the mindset that "it's fine, I'll smoke maybe until I'm like 23, that's only a couple years, it won't affect me at all long term". So I was smoking all the time without worrying about the effects of it. You know, like all dumb teenagers like me do.

Yesterday was a great day. The sun was out (a rarity where I live), so I spent the whole morning/afternoon in the park with my friends. We sat on the grass smoking spliffs, and I was smoking cigarettes too. I probably smoked about 4-5 in the afternoon alone. 

I roll my own, so inevitably I ran out of filters. Fuck it, I'll smoke a roached ciggie. I've done it before, and it's always kind of nice, how raw and powerful the smoke tastes - besides, it gives me an insane rush.

That was the mistake that has made me finally take serious consideration in regards to quitting. For the rest of the day, I had numbness in my ankles, and when I woke up this morning, I felt like I had the worst flu of my life, plus I had a small rash on my neck and a pain in my upper right chest. 

Immediately I start freaking out that I have cancer/Buerger's disease, and whether these symptoms are related or not I don't know - they could be and probably are pure coincidence. But they made me realise that smoking isn't a case of "I'll be fine, it'll do no harm", and that my health isn't a game.

So from this day forth I'm gonna try dropping them cold turkey. No vapes, no patches, no gum. I want the nicotine out of my system entirely. I've heard this method described as "three days of hell", so I guess the worst is yet to come.

Just thought I'd share my thoughts, in case anyone else still has the mindset I did. Hell, I'd rather feel like I have the flu for three days than die of cancer!

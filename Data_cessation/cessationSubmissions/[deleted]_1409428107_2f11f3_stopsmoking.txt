Day 70 Cake

Last minute decision after the pub lunch, made with things in the house. Excuses out of the way...it can best be described as a tarted up Tesco Value Cake. Victoria Sponge with smashed raspberries spread on top, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.

Looks a bit gruesome: http://imgur.com/XEklNKQ  but tasted quite good...lasted all of one hour. Helps to have skinny husband. :))

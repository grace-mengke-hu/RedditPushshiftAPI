I meant to do this a few days ago but forgot. 1000 days. Cold Turkey after 15 years. I am all that is man!

No pills. No gum. No patches. No vapes (that shit is a scam anyway). Just 100% will-power and not even that difficult really. I used to tell myself I couldn't do it. I used to tell myself I didn't want to deal with the hassle. I used to even tell myself I enjoyed smoking and didn't want to quit. Then I realized: all of that is the addiction talking. Stop being a slave to a chemical.

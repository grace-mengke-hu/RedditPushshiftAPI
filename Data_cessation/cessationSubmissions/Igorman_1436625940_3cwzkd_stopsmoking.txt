Today I dreamed of smoking..

So it's been one week since i quit smoking (yay) after smoking almost a pack a day for 10 years. Today I had a dream that I was smoking in my bed; when I woke up it felt like I just had a nightmare as I thought that I started smoking again...

I'm also gonna go out today for the first time since I quit smoking. I'm thinking about buying a disposable ecig in order to help with cravings. From my previous quitting attempts I know that alcohol is huge trigger for me.

I stumbled upon an interesting quote recently: "The urge to smoke will pass whether you give in to it or not". I think us quitters can really relate to it.

Cheers

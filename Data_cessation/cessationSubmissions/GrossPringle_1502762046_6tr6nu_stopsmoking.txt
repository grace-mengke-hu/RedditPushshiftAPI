Day four rambling

I keep remembering some beautiful, totally fictitious, moment of smoking. The truth is it was never beautiful, and rarely was it even enjoyable. It was usually me inhaling smoke, barely present, while staring at my phone. Then last week I was like WTF AM I DOing?? Anyways...

Four days in.

All my stuff smells like stale smoke. I didn't smoke in my apartment but the smell is here. How can cigarettes dull your senses so much? My car is the worst though! I used to light up a cig when I smelled second hand smoke so that I wouldn't smell it. I think what I miss most, in this moment, is not not smelling smoke.

When I started smoking some of my family members said I was a hypocrite for starting smoking because when I was a little kid I used to complain so. much. about their smoking. (The nerve of me complaining about my dad/grandparents smoking in the car with three kids in it!) But now that I think of it, maybe if they hadn't smoked around me so much when I was so little I wouldn't have started up myself. I'm not blaming them entirely but statistics show... blah blah blah.

It doesn't even matter now. I'm taking control of my own actions. I'm four days in and I don't want to fuck this up. This community has been my rock. Thank you all for coming here and posting your stories.

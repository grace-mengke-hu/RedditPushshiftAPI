That's it. I'm done. I'm not finishing this pack.

About an hour ago I was in bed, about to fall asleep. What did I do? I turned off the tv, got up, got dressed, walked outside, lit up, stood there screwing around on my phone for 5 minutes, threw the butt into the ash tray (which is now just a pile of butts with an ash tray poking up out of the middle of it, came back inside, got undressed, crawled into bed...

...and realized I didn't even crave a cigarette in first place. The only reason I did all of that crap was because it's the same thing I've done almost every night for nearly 10 years, since I was 16 years old.

I'm done with this. I'm getting back out of bed as soon as I hit submit and filling the half of a pack I have left with those old cigarette butts around the ash tray. I'm going to wake up in the morning and if I think about smoking I'm going to smell that pack to remind myself of how shitty I felt as I wrote this.

I'm going to update this post tomorrow with how it's going.  Wish me luck.

Edit: just fyi, i couldnt submit this last night for some reason so i hit submit this morning.

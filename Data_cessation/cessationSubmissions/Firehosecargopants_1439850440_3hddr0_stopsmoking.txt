First day back at work since I quit

An advil for the morning aches (i think big tobacco sent someone to beat me with a baseball bat last night) and a smoothie and I was good to go.  I could not tell you a thing that happened today, my concentration was on par with the dogs in "up".  I know from past attempts that if i make it past three days...i'm good to go unless alcohol comes into play.  It is really nice to be able to come to this sub when I have a craving.  Thanks everybody!

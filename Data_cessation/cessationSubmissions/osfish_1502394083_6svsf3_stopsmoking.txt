Third hand smoke from a borrowed truck?

So it's been quite a while...  today I had to help a friend move some one out of a storage unit. Another friend let me borrow a truck. Well the driver is a super heavy smoker.  The smell hit me like a ton of bricks getting in.  I definitely don't want to smoke ever again. Especially smelling that. It's been two hours and still feeling jittery.   Anyone else experience this?

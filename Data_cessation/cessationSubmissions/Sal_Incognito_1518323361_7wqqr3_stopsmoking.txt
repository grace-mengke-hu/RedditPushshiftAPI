How do you do it?

This is my first post on this sub and my billionth quit attempt, and I'm about 20 hours in. I had some success in the fall (6 weeks) and have had some worse attempts since then. My big question to all you who have quit is: how do you get it out of your life?

I'm having trouble imagining a world where I don't smoke, whether because I enjoy it or while I'm doing something else. Commuting 3+ hours a day? Walking the dog for around 1.5 hours a day? Drinking coffee early weekend mornings? How did you disassociate it with all those activities?

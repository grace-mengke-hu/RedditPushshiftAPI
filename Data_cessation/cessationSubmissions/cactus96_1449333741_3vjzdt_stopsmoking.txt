Which date do i take for stoping?

I've stopped first on 28th of august but then i smoked a cig yesterday.So for the date of stoping smoking do i take 28th of august or 5th of december?And please,some of you may tell me it does not matter what date it is,only the feeling and the fact you stopped.Date matters,that's how you keep track of your progress and motivate yourself.

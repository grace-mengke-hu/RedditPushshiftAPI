Being supportive... but it's making him sick

Hello, I guess you could say I'm an ex-smoker but it's been 15 years (was introduced really young) since I've had one.

I've been engaged and dating someone for almost 5 years now. As the years have gone on his smoking has sort of come and gone, but the last 2 years fairly consistent. He is genuinely addicted, and it is starting to affect his health.

Not only that but when he tries to quit he can be downright mean and angry, I try my best not to piss him off but it can be like walking through a minefield. He is quite young, but complains of chest pains and heart palpitations sometimes, he can't get a full breath of air from smoking all week. He is starting to get sick a lot, like catching a lot of things... it seems like his immune system is low too.

Plus... this is embarrassing... he's becoming impotent. he tells me he has no libido.

I've been very supportive every time he quits or fails at it, I don't ever tell him he has to quit I just gently encourage him when he has a few days under his belt or when he gives in.

But this is all adding up and its not just hurting him its hurting our relationship too, add to that I'm reactive to cigarette smoke, so if there's any residue or smell left on him I have an allergic reaction. If he washes well and hasn't smoked that day it usually does the trick.

He's struggled w/ impotency last year and its happening again, he informed me today. I'm worried about him and us, what ought I to do? Esp when he has such a volatile and unpredictable temper?

**TL;DR: Fiance/BF of five years addicted to cigarrettes, only in his 20s and having heart palpitations and impotency. Have been supportive but is making him sick, don't know what to do. Very irritable. I'm afraid he's going to die.**

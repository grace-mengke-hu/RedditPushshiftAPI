Taking the step

Hello all,

I am 22 years old, and have been smoking around 1.5 years. Unless on a social occasion, I have always wanted to quit and my friends and girlfriend have stated I smoked too much (1 pack a day) and I have become self conscious.

I found this subreddit, read A LOT of the success stories and advices given when someoneslips, and I have decided to get rid of this once and for all.

I got Alan Carr's book, and I am close to finish. Not yet finished so still smoking if I get the chance; but 2 important things I got from it thus far;

Cost of "just one cigarette" is a lot higher

always think that the next smoke is the killer

I am now more aware o what I am doing, and think about what I have done and how it affected me after I smoke. I understand, logically (because I am an analytical thinker), cigarette has done nothing for me, after a cigarete I savor the taste and despise it, think "is the monster satisfied? No.. So can it be satisfied? I don't think so".

So far so good; but here is the problem. I can't decide on a time to quit. I am rushing through the book, bu for example this morning I said "I won't smoke today", but I smoked one cigarette when my gf smoke. She justified it by saying "you haven't finished the book yet; and he mandates you not to quitting while reading", but if I could have quit, that would be awesome, then the book will help me further.

So, any advice on when I should actually dedicate? Right now? When I finish the book? After I am through graduation (doing MSc. in Engineering, kinda stressfull; though I know now cigs don't relieve stress)? Again from the book "Tomorrow it will not be easier to quit than today" is another lesson that struck me, but I am kinda lost about the "when" despite the discalimer.


Sorry for the long wall of text, I hope you find it a good read (as good as it can be for a smoker confession but :) )

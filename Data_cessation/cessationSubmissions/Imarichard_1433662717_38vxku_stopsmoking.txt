Two months

Today marked two months without a cigarette. I suppose since it's after midnight where I am, it's really been two months as of yesterday. 

I still have urges once in a while... But the idea of having one is immediately rather... Upsetting, in some ways... I'm proud of my accomplishment thus far, and want to keep this healthy thing going.

So, for all you whom have quit, or are contemplating it? Good on you!

- cheers

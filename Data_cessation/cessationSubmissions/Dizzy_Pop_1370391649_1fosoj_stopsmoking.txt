The last excuse

I've been sitting here on the fence, thoroughly convinced that I need to quit. I'm down from a pack-a-day for 18 years to only having four per day.

But I can't quit today, because I'm starting a new job, and I don't want to come off as a prick for my first impression on my co-workers (instead my first impression will be stinking like smoke).

I can't quit tomorrow because then I'll be a wreck for my date, instead of acting calm and natural like I'm supposed to (instead I'll have breath like an ashtray, that's fun to kiss, right?)

There will never be a perfect time. And what's more, is that I really don't *know* how bad, how irritable, how nervous I'll be, because I haven't made the attempt. 

These excuses, and *all* excuses, are really just fear. I'm afraid of how I'll feel without my crutch (even though it's the thing making me miserable).

I need to get over it, walk through the fear, and *just freaking commit already!*

I've made my last excuse. It's time.

6 days quit

I'm 22, first time quitter (aside from a 12 hour stretch a few months ago), I've been smoking since I was 13. Decided to quit once I noticed I'd gotten up to a pack a day. Doctor prescribed me the patch and since then I haven't touched a cig. It feels amazing. Still getting minor cravings but the intensity of which I taste and smell everything is so cool and I feel so clean. Thanks to this sub for planting the quitting seed in my mind :) not another puff no matter what ;)

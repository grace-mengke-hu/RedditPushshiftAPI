Had one of those craving rages.

Today (I'm on day 2) I was in the car raging at everything; other drivers, pedestrians, traffic lights, the fact that I was driving, etc. but I knew that it was really about cigarettes. Thank goodness I don't have any cigs in the car or in my house, because I might have smoked one. Probably not, but I MIGHT have.

Then it occurred to me that I always rage like this when I want a cigarette but can't have one; like when I'm at work or someplace like that. That means, as soon as I've gotten over the nicotine addiction, I won't be raging like that anymore! The next time I have one of those crazy rages, it won't affect me so badly because I'll know I won't be having them for much longer. Instead of a rage making me want to grab a smoke, it will make me glad I don't.

So, bring on the rages, you nicotine bastard. They're only making me stronger and you weaker.

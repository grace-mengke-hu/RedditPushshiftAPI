I completely forgot

So, when I finally decided that I was no longer a smoker, after about 7 years of intermittent smoking and 3 as a heavy smoker, a silly thought came to me. 'Maybe, when I hit the 100 days mark, I will make a post to stopsmoking and that way I'll keep my motivation'.

Turns out I'm late by 28 days because I completely forgot about it. I forgot that cigarettes were a thing. I forgot that dreadful sense of thinking about them every 30 minutes. And it's the best feeling in the world. When you finally realize that it no longer controls you, that you no longer need them.

Day 15. Start of Week 3....

... and I'm going for a run. According to my Cessation Nation app my nicotine dependence has been 100% eliminated as of this morning. I in no way believe the struggle is over but seeing that number still makes me happy.

Today I will attempt to actually jog 2.5K of my 5K route. It may be lame to some but it feels good to me. 

Thanks to all of you who post your successes and failures on here. You folks have really helped me make it to my modest milestone. I come her every morning to steel my resolve and I really feel this is one of the most supportive communities on Reddit.

Keep fighting the good fight.

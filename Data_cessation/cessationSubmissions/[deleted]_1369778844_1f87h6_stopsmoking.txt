7 years on, 2 years off, 1 back on... time to finish what i started.

Yeah so i smoked heavily for 7 years (beginning at 14) then i quit easily right after i finished my service in the Marines. It was easy the first time. I used the patch for 3 days but stopped because it made my skin leathery, but mostly owe my success to the copious amounts of marijuana i replaced the ciggs with. After awhile i got complacent and missed the social aspect of being a smoker, and took up smoking here and there in order to meet girls on campus. This gradually progressed to a full on relapse. (yaay)
Now i've been on and off smoking for a month or two, but today decided that enough is enough.
Im just writing this as a resolution, to say i've put it out there.. this time no marijuana, just pure concentrated power of will.
Lets do this.......... [day zero].

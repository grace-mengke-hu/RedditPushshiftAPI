Anyone else NOT feel much different after quitting?

Hey, so I am only on day 4 this time, but have quit for up to 3 months before.  I don't have a cough or wheeze (been smoking 30 years), and I never cough up crap when I have quit in the past. Kinda sucks not to have that obvious sign of emerging health! I wonder what it means...

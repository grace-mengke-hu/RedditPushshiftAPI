I'm having difficulty quitting... Anyone who is willing to give advice, that would be helpful.

I have been a slave to cigarettes for 12 years.

I have attempted to quit many times but somehow always end up picking it up again. More recently, I have been cutting back. I got down to 1 a day, now I am back up to a half a pack. I don't know what to do anymore. Quitting cod turkey hasn't worked either. I also bought an e-cig, that helped me quit the first time, but hasn't worked for me again. 

I used the e cig to help me quit. I stopped smoking for 2 months or so, then I was working a really busy night at my bar and figured I would just bum one cig... then I met my bf. He asked to bum a cig off of me, I told him I didn't have any but I could get him one. I remembered that right before our first date, so I bought a pack so he wouldn't feel bad. I told myself, I'll throw it out after the date. I then rationalized that I could just smoke the rest of the pack and won't buy another... that was nearly 2 years ago. Now, I can't seem to figure out how to kick this habit. 

It doesn't even taste good anymore, unless I have an intense craving. I can barely stand the smell of it. I hate that when I work out, my body wants me to keep going, but my lungs tell me to stop. 

He's ready to quit too... but he has less self control than I do. 

What has helped for you?

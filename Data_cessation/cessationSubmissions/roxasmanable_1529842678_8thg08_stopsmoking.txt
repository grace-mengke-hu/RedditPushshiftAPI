I Need Help Getting Rid of This Addiction

  Hi Reddit, so I'm 19 and have smoked cigarettes for quite some time. I have no idea why I started, and I quit for awhile and only started again because of the pressure of a social situations I was in.
  I'm tired of wasting money and my health on this stupid and disgusting habit but i don't know how. Everyone I talk to smokes and I don't want to cut them off, though I'd say that they're an unhealthy influence on me both physically and mentally.
  I'm starting school to get my generals out of the way and start working to a major, but that's not for another two months almost. I want to stop this now and pursue my hobbies and interests so I can be happy, because I know I've been happy. Like I said, I just don't know how to go about it. Please, I would love advice from you guys. 

Lots of love, guys ❤️

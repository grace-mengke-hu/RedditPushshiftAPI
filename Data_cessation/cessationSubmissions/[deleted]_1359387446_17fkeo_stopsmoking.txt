The sense of accomplishment, satisfactions, and benefits, you feel after JUST TWO WEEKS is totally worth it.

It's hard when you're on the onset of quitting to realize how beneficial it will be. 

You don't realize that in just two weeks, you'll love the taste of food again. That you'll have more energy and you're less distracted at moments of the day by your addiction. You don't realize that you won't lose your breath walking or exerting physical effort. You'll start to stop coughing up a lung and spitting phlegm a deep, dull, and disgusting yellow and black in the mornings. I can hit on girls without being worried that they'll be put off by the smell of my cig or that I'll have to leave them to smoke one. I didn't realize I'd be ten times more social! That I'd start working out again because my motivation and drive increased. 

Two weeks. Two weeks and I already feel like a better man. 

Give it two weeks, and you'll love yourself ten times more than you ever did as a smoker.

I quit on a Monday at 10 AM two weeks ago. When did you?

**Edit:** I forgot perhaps my favorite perk. My reproductive organ (yeah, mah dick) legitimately works better. I kid you not! Smoking constricts blood flow so I guess that's why.

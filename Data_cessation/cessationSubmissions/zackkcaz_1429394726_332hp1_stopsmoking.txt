Im on my second day.

Honestly this is a lot harder than I ever imagined. I only really started seeing my self as addicted recently after i was buying a pack a day and realizing I could never afford it at this rate (Massachusetts has ridiculous taxes so I pay about 10 dollars for Marlboro). Im irritable, tired and am currently experiencing a horrible head ache and all I want to do right now is go to the store and buy a pack. Ive tried e cigarettes but they just dont have the same feeling, I also tried dipping but it was more of a hassle to carry around a bottle of spit. This fucking sucks but it will all be worth it.

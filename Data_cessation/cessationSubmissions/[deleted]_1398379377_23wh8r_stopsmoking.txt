Four days in and--oh my god-- my throat!

So far, I feel great. Like basically everyone else here, I read Allen Carr's book, and quitting has been way easier than I ever thought possible. Good times!

Now that the slight physical cravings are all but gone, the thing that's really bugging me is my throat. It feels really scratchy and full of phlegm. Yeah, it's pretty gross and unpleasant, but the disturbing part is that it's a testament to how badly I'd been abusing my throat for the past 5 years that I smoked. It's like my throat has been hibernating all this time and is finally waking up and clearing out all the crud. It's gross, but also a good reminder of how great it is to be a nonsmoker.

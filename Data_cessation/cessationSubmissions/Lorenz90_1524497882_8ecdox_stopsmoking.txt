Just relapsed after more than a month.

I feel horrible about it but in the last 2 week i was thinking only about the fact that i couldn't smoke. 
It is all psychological because after a month the nicotine withdrawal is long gone.

I scheduled an appointment with a terapist to talk about my addiction because it's too strong to beat with only my will power.

I failed another time and i feel miserable

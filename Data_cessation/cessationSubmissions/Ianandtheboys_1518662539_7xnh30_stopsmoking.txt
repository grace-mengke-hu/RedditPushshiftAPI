I used weed to quit smoking cigs

 I wanna start by saying I did not smoke weed; I used edibles. And this advice is only for people who are weed friendly! So I got enough edibles for 3 days and had 3 days off from work too. I pretty much got so high that I got "couchlocked" and even though I really wanted to smoke I didn't because I was couchlocked lol. You'll still be in a bad mood from the nicotine withdrawal but being high makes it fly by. Plus passing out for a few hours at a time is nice lol. Once you get passed the 3 days, you'll still have mental triggers but give it a few minutes and it'll pass I promise! It gets easier every passing day. I'm now nicotine free for 4 months and glad I quit. Best of luck to everyone who's trying to quit nicotine.

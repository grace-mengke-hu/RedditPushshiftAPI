What worked for you when you were trying to quit?

I’m not a smoker myself. But I’m helping a friend quit smoking. He wants to quit and he’s tried a few times before. 

We were thinking of trying to first lower the amount of cigarettes he smokes in a day by reducing the number each month. But he’s also toyed with the idea of getting a juul. Has anyone had any experiences with using a juul to stop smoking? Or even just weaning themselves off?

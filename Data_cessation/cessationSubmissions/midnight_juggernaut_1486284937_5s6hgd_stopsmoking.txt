Chain vaping made me more addicted.

Hello to you all nice people. Today I am 9 days nicotine free.
But boy, it is a really tough fight. I have basically been switching between cigarettes and vaping for a few years now, usually doing both - chain vaping heavy amounts of e-juice, and smoking "analogs" at the same time. Very unsustainable bad habit. What I didn't realize was my mental addiction to vaping. I was vaping all the time at home, even 0 mg nicotine e-juice. I have hidden my vape box mod, e-juices, flavouring, and the temptation is killing me! My physical withdrawal symptoms are non-existent, because I was mostly vaping low nicotine e-juice and only smoked a few cigarettes per day, but the thought of some kind of smoke coming out of my mouth is so soothing to me.

So if you use vaping to quit, go ahead! Lower your nicotine levels, very slowly, even if it took you a year to do so.. don't rush it. And after you are at 1 mg or even 0 mg, just quit, don't continue to vape, or you'll get addicted to it like me.

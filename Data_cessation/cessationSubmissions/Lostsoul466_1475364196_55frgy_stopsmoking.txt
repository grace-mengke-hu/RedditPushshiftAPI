What helps when the cravings are continuous?

I give myself an out loud pep talk (I have many reasons to quit). I talk myself out of that craving but then another comes and another and soon it seems like I'm running out of idea to keep myself distracted/motivated. What do you guys do that helps either long term or short term? (p.s. Still didn't cave today. I got this! I'm just scared for the future)

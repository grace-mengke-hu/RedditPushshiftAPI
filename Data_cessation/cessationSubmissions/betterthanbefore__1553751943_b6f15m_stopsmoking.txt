Thoughts on vaping and quitting

Smoker for 4 years.  Half a pack a day. Did Allen Carr twice, and quit for 4 months the first time. I recently switched from cigarettes to vaping the last couple weeks (I got tired of always smelling like smoke) and wanted to share my perspective for anyone who's interested. 

I'm familiar with Carr's perspective on NRT and/or vaping, and how cold turkey quitting is often best. However, I think the advantage of switching to a vape before a quit, for me, is not really that it helps you manage your nicotine intake, but that it reduces your cigarette habit to a pure chemical addiction. 

I'd always related the experience of smoking cigarettes to past experiences with friends or specific situations, even when chain-smoking alone on my patio at 4 am. Switching to vaping has made me infinitely more conscious of that connection I was making, while doubling my nicotine intake. Coincidentally, even though I'm in taking much more nicotine, I'm more unhappy with the experience because I'm more aware it's just a chemical addiction getting in the way of my life. After months of unsuccessfully planning a cold turkey quit, this switch has fundamentally changed my relationship to nicotine and I feel it's put me much closer to a successful quit. 

Just some food for thought for anyone in a similar situation. 

Good luck everyone!

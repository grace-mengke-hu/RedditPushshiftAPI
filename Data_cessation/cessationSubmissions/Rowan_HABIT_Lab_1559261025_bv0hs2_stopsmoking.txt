Quit Smoking Study!



Hi Everyone!

My name is Schyler and I'm a student and research assistant at a small university on the east coast. The lab I work in is focused on developed scalable, evidence-based interventions that are accessible to a variety of demographics. Our team worked with the creators of Diner Dash to create a game specifically designed to help smokers quit. This study lasts 7 weeks. If you are interested, please complete the screening link I've included or feel free to give it a share!

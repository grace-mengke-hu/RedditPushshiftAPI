Anyone else on ADD medication trying to quit? Any advice?

I find that days on which I take my medication (vyvanse) my desire to smoke nearly doubles. It's eerie how consistent this is as I always smoke twice as much as I would normally.  I have read articles which suggest this could be cause by these medications constricting the bronchial airway, making the inhalation aspect more enjoyable/desirable. Anyway, I was hoping someone here might be experiencing the same thing or have some kind of advice.

66 Hours!! Trying to take everything one step at a time.

Hey everyone, hope you all are doing well today. I'm a few minutes away from 66 hours as I type this and I gotta say I feel a lot better than I thought I would. I get cravings but I think about how it's not worth it and I've just been separating myself from smoking situations as much as I can. My sleeping patterns have been a little wonky, been very tired but my biggest complaint is probably the mood swings. It's really frustrating! But I know that this is part of the process so accepting it is making things a lot easier. I already feel a difference in my breathing though, which is very encouraging. Anyone who is having a hard time, YOU GOT THIS!! I promise you do.

has anyone else found quitting easy? or is this calm before the storm?

i'm day 15 now, and despite being surrounded by smokers including my own mom who is on 40 a day, i don't really feel any urge to smoke, the cravings are almost non-existent and even when i do feel like i need a ciggy it goes within about 30 seconds. Will it remain this way? or does it get more difficult as time passes? I was a 20 a day smoker for 9 years before now.

i've put on 7 pounds in weight in 2 weeks mind....

What's your reason?

So I'm barely into my third day (44 minutes to be exact) and I can't sleep for shit. What's your top 3 reasons to quit. I think for me, other than paying tobacco companies to kill me, I'd say

1. I lost my mom to cigarettes so that's my biggest reason. 

2. The girl that turned my life around and made me a better man, I can't leave her because of some addiction. 

C. Financing my new car at 19 is cheaper than a months worth of cigs:)
(Keep that in mind car guys, $6 a day adds up)

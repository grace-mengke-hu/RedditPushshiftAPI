Day 2!

Can't stop moving my legs around and getting the insane food cravings. I've quit before so this doesn't come as a surprise, just funny how the body works! Getting nervous about day 3 tomorrow and having to be back at work. For me day 3 has always been notoriously bad, and it'll be a Monday at that. Not quite sure yet how to fill up my work breaks besides smoking :(

In the meantime, I think I'll go ahead and have that cake after all.

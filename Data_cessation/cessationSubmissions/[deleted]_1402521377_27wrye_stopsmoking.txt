Day one, again.

This is probably the sixth attempt at quitting cigarettes. I've spent a lot of time lurking this thread and reading over the different experiences people have had. I'm eighteen, unemployed, graduating high school in a week, with no future plans of going to college, and I WANT to stop. I recently went out and bought what the clerk said was an atomizer, an e cig that burns nicotine oil I'm assuming. He said it had been working for him ever since. I can't really tell if it's working for me as I find every excuses to light one up. Wish me luck on this treacherous journey I am about to embark on fellow quitters.

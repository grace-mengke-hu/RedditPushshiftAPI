364 days!

I just realized it has been a year without a cigarette. Reddit disagrees and says tomorrow is the day. Now I'm trying to remember if I had my last one on the 22nd or if I started counting from the first smoke free day on the 23rd or what. Oh, well. Pretty happy about the whole thing overall. Now to work on losing some of that weight I put on.

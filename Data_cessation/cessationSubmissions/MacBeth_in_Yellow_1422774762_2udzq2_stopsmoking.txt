I've now used my e-cigarette for its original purpose: to keep me from buying a pack of real cigarettes.

It's now been... however long my badge says now since my last cigarette.

I've long held the hypothesis that an e-cigarette could substitute for a real smoke when those absolutely-impossible-to-ignore nicotine fits happens. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about: those fits that *you just can't fucking ignore because Jesus Nutsack Christ I need a goddamned smoke* but hey, I committed to quitting so I need *something* to deal...

So I take a few pulls off my e-smoke and... it's not too bad now. Seriously. It's not so much that I'm replacing the smoking habit with a vape habit, it's just that I need something for those *moments* that isn't a cigarette. (In the past, I've used pot to deal with this, but it's a hell of a lot harder to find the stuff when you get older.)

Anyway, anyone tells you that e-cigs are "cheating" is full of shit. I say if taking a few pulls off an e-cig keeps you from buying a pack when you're going nuts, more power to you. And for me, it's not about trading one habit for another, it's about having something to deal with those moments of need... you know, the ones that just cannot be ignored. Some of you get what I'm talking about, I'm sure.

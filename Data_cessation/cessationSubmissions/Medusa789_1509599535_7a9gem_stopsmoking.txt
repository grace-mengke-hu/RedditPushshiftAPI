I'm an expert at quitting now....but after 2-3 weeks some stressful situation occurs and I'm off the wagon. Any advice as to how to cope during these times? Definitely feeling discouraged and hopeless.

I've "successfully" quit about 4 times now. I'll make it through the withdrawals and what not, but once 2-3 weeks comes around something stressful will pop up (e.g. big college exam, heavy workload, argument with boyfriend etc.) and I'm back to the habit like clockwork. 


Does anyone have any advice for how to handle these big, stressful events that will inevitably happen? Any wise words I could remind myself with during that time? Or has anyone else even had a similar experience? I'm really beginning to feel discouraged and trapped -  my efforts just aren't paying off. Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi all - I've just run out of cigarettes and this is generally the part where I go out to get more. I need your help...

I've tried everything - nictonine patches, self-help books, vapes (which kept on snapping in half in my pocket), gum, cold turkey, inhalators, everything apart from hypnsosis.

I've been telling myself for the past 2 years that "I'll smoke this packet, and then that'll be it. One more." Two years I've been doing that. Not even watching my partner quit, nor the arrival of my son a year and a half ago has quenched my appetite for killing myself with this horrible shit. It's got to the point where I'm waking up with terrible chest pains now.

I welcome any advice at this point where I find myself, once again, saying the aforementioned "One more packet" line to myself. Anything which worked for you which I can adopt?

I figure being a part of this community will help hopefully.  Thanks a lot.

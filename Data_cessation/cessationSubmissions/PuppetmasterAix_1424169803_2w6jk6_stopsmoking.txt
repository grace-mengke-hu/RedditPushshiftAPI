One month :)

I just want to thank every single one of you and wish you strength, reading about your experiences gave me so much strength getting through the first month. Yesterday i said those magic words to a stranger for the first time in a very long time: "I don't smoke." I am now a non smoker and not a smoker that quit. Thank you and join me in not smoking today.

After a while, it really doesn't feel that weird...

You know the feeling where you want to quit - the tightness in your chest, the nagging cough wont go away (but for some reason it only makes you want a cigarette), hacking up some really nasty shit, you finally realize how much you're spending on these things - you know, you have every reason and the desire to quit. 

You put that question in your head, "Is this my last cigarette"?

But then it hits you: "What the fuck am I going to do with myself"? "Am I just going to be a non-smoker all of a sudden"? "I don't even remember what that's like"!

It's scary. Really fucking scary.

I think I've actually seen that through. I've gotten drunk on patios filled with smokers. I've hung out with my smoking friends while they had a cigarette and I didn't. I've driven a friend long distances while they smoked the whole time. I've become what I never thought I would ever be again: a non-smoker. 

I know I'm still less than a month in and I've still got a long way to go, but I think I'm actually seeing this thing through. I still have 'smoking dreams' and I still want to claw my eyes out every now and again, but really, I don't want to go back. I don't need this anymore.

TL;DR When you get to the other side of this, it's really not all that weird.

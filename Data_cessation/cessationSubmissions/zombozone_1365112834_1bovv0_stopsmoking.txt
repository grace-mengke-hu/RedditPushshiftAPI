Days go by

It's been almost a week since I quit.  I actually was blacked out when I had my last cigarette (had it, or threw it away?).  I'd always maintained I'd quit by the time I turned 30.  Well, I turned 29 last week and I just feel like I need to improve myself.  I feel like I should at last try and turn myself into the person that I've always wanted to be, fitter, happier, more productive, not drinking too much, etc.

So the problem this week is, I've started having a really hard time getting out of bed in the mornings.  I'm starting to feel like smoking was the one excuse I had to leave my house.  My girlfriend doesn't smoke, and I don't smoke at home, so now everything is up in the air.  No more fast food (trying to eat healthy as well), no more cigarettes.

What has worked for you guys on a day to day basis?  How do you stop the craving after you eat something, when you're walking to the bus, when you need a 5 minute break from work?  How are things on the other side of this, are you fitter? happier? more productive?

6 years of the harsh tobacco bite.

Oh tobacco. Cigarette cylinders. Leave me be.

Ivve been browbeaten by the smokes. I hate nicotine.

i dont wanna do this anymore. I dont wanna huff smoke thorugh my lungs.

I hate being restless, anxious, depressed.

I hate thinking that smoking will help me feel better. That if i smoke, my head will clear.

I hate every cigarette I smoke, after righteously resolving to quit.

I hate this endless cycle of addiction.

I hate the sinus problems it brings. The lethargy it brings. The headaches it brings. 

I wanna be free. I dont want to give smoking anymore money.

Id like to get that foul taste outta my mouth. And that dry feeling outta my throat.

I'd like to reset my brain to zero again. That of a non-smoker.

Id like to taste my fucking food.

Id like to run without huddin and puffin.

Id like to clear my blocked nose.

Id like to say "Man, I finally quit smoking. For good this time". 

EDIT:
i had a slip today. Im also quitting pot so my mind is a hot mess right now. removing my badge for now. 

Everyday, i wake and hear the voice in my head screaming for a cigarette. I cant fight that fucker. that sack of shit, motherless cunt. I hate all the fuckin LIES that fucker spews at me to get me to smoke. 

Im so tired. Ive tried qutting for no less than 200 times(not exaggerating). Im so sick and tired of living like this, I feel worn out and beaten down. 

Theres some deep rooted desire in me to keep smoking. Like I cant imagine windy afternoons sitting in the beach, and not having a cigarette for company. 

Addiction, leave me be. Please. Leave me alone. Your lies are boring. Your ways are vile. 

fuckin hell. Im quitting now. Right FUCKING now. No more of this bullshit. Fuck all the social pressure, and the fucking glamorisation of these fucking cancersticks. Screw the tobacco lobby. And the nictoine, you oily sack of shit. Im SO done with your bullshit. 

Hope you hear this Pop. Your son's quit smoking.

Waiting for that happy face to become a 1

Last Sunday I had my last two cigarettes. It was 4 days before that day that I decided to quit. I was reading Allen Carr (again) and I knew my time had come. On Sunday I was hanging out with friends playing kickball in the park. Only one other guy there smoked. I didn't smoke at all until Sunday kickball only because I KNEW those cigarettes wouldn't do a damn thing. I had one and...nothing. We played a game. I had one more and told Scott (the guy I bummed off) that I was done. Later that day I drove from Richmond,Va to Washington DC to start a course and put myself in a new environment. It's been the longest Ive gone without smoking in at least a year and I know I will never have one again. We can do this.

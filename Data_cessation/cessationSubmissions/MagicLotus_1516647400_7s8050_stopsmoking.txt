Day 10 after 6 years of smoking.

Hello all, please scroll down to the **tl;dr** if you don't want to read this wall of text. I'd really appreciate some insight!

**Early Smoking Years:**

I picked up smoking in January 2012 to help with my insomnia. I'd smoke one cigarette each night before going to sleep, it would make me so dizzy that I would fall asleep almost immediately after.

After 3 years of smoking, I picked up smoking Marijuana in January 2015 after I realized cigarettes were no longer enough to help me sleep. In early 2015 I'd smoke a quarter of a joint followed by a cigarette and then immediately go to sleep. But as the years went by (2015-2017) I increased my intake to eventually smoking 2 joints of Marijuana and anywhere between 1-5 cigarettes a night (not all at once, over the span of 3-5 hours).

**Quitting:**

On the 12th of January 2018, I had my last joint and my last cigarette. I am now on my 10th day, and strangely enough I haven't had any cravings whatsoever. I still have half a pack of cigarettes lying in my room as well as some marijuana that my eyes accidentally land on each morning. Despite that, I haven't *wanted* to smoke a single once nor do I ever think about smoking. If anything, I'm repulsed each morning when I see the cigarettes. I don't want to complain about this, but why is that? Why am I not craving nicotine? It makes absolutely no sense to me, and it actually kind of worries me.

Anyway, I've been affected by some minor things that haven't really bothered me that much, such as mood swings (I manage to control them), anxiety and depression (I've been depressed long before picking up smoking so I can handle it).

**The Problem:**

The thing that has made these 10 days feel like absolute HELL is the physical changes I've been experiencing. I've been constipated, nauseous and worst of all experiencing a pain/tightness in the left side of my chest when I breathe.

I've been seeing a doctor about my constipation, and the nausea I believe is caused mainly by my constipation so I'm not that worried about those two things. What bothers me is the tightness in my left chest. **Every** single breath is hell, and I don't even know if it's my lungs, my heart or the muscles in that area that's hurting. It's not exactly an oww!-pain, but more of an uncomfortable, "far away" sting or tightness. And it feels like I can't always breathe all the way in, which is incredibly frustrating.

I can't help but worry that this feeling is the start of lung cancer? I've told my doctor I want to check my lungs and have an appointment for a spirometry a week from now. But if it's not lung cancer, then what? Is it permanent? Will each breath haunt me for the rest of my life? Truly? Because I honestly don't believe I'd be ok with living like this. If it's permanent, then I'd rather go back to smoking so that I can at least live without any pain up until the point when I actually do get lung cancer and then maybe off myself. But if it's temporary, if I KNOW it's temporary, I can live with it. Even if it takes a week, a month or a year (please no), as long as I know that I can someday go back to breathing normally and being able to move around and exercise normally, I can push through.

It's **very** hard to stay positive when each breath feels like I'm dying and brings me into a spiral of negativity..

**tl;dr** - Is this uncomfortable feeling of chest pain/tightness whenever I breathe normal? Is it permanent or temporary? If it's temporary, how long until it passes? If it's permanent, why should I even quit smoking if smoking makes my lungs feel better than when not smoking?

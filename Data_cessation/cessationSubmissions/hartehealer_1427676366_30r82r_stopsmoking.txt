Quitting and Jogging

Today, day 6, has been one hell of a roller coaster.

I thought my mood had improved after some Starbucks and a purchase of Nerd Ropes (come on, they're childhood gold to me). But I had a second shift at work and it steamrolled through my mood once again. The end of my shift brought the worst craving so far and all I knew was I didn't want to end my night so upset so I determined to go for a jog. The first since July of last year when I did a 5k and then stopped because smoking seemed to take priority.

I got in a mile even though at times I thought I was going to die. I've got mild sports-induced asthma (and didn't take allergy medication this morning) so when the jog ended I spent a good 20 minutes after coughing horrendously--hoarse, you sound like you're getting a cold-cough. And my father came to stare at me but I waved him away telling him it was mostly my lungs struggle to clear themselves thanks to the smoking damage. Anyone else hit a jog as they quit smoking and suffer terrible coughing fits? How long before you saw serious improvement (less coughing, better stamina)?

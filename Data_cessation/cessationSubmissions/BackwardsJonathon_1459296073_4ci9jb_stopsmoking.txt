Any advice on quitting for young smokers?

I made a post about this earlier, but it was a little rambly and I was emotional and upset with myself...so I'll try again, and keep it brief!


I am an 18 year old girl from the UK. I usually smoke a little over a pack a day. Please don't get the wrong impression of me! I'm not the rebellious teen who doesn't care about things, if anything I overthink things and I get anxiety and panic over the stupidest things... 


I started smoking aged 15 messing around with friends, and smoked very occasionally until I was 17. This is when the 'proper' school exams started, and I turned into a nervous wreck who turned to cigarettes in order to calm myself down while studying.


As time has passed and exams/revision/studying has become more important, my dependence on cigarettes has grown to the point now where I smoke at virtually every opportunity I get, and it's starting to really affect my life. 


I want to quit, but I don't know how to start. I smoke most of the day, and get extremely fidgety and anxious if I go even an hour without smoking...and this is a particularly stressful part of my life. 


Is there anyone else that was a heavy smoker when they were young? Possibly going through important exams or something else stressful in their life? How did you go about quitting?

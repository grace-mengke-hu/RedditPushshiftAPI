I never 'tried' to quit, I just did, without trying...

I'm curious if anyone else has had this experience.  I smoked a lot, heavily for ten years.  A month ago I was chain-smoking in my apartment as always, with some friends, the next day I woke up and I didn't feel bad (like i have in the past), I just didnt feel like smoking.  So I didnt.  And now it's been 35 days, and honestly in my life I am surrounded by smokers, all the time, and it hasn't really bothered me that much.  Just wanted to post this for anyone struggling, I tried to quit many many times, when I stop trying...so FAR, it worked, and I don't know why.

edit:  for what it matters, I purposefully carried around my rolling tobacco for the first two weeks so that if I wanted to smoke I could.  I actually still have a giant jar of tobacco in my house...for some reason I like the idea that if I want to right now I could smoke, but I am constantly choosing not to.

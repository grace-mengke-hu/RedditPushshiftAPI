I smoked close to 40 cigarettes tonight

Yeah, you read that right. I'm pretty hammered, and I bought a pack of cigarettes after finishing my first pack. Between 5:30PM and 3:30AM, I have smoked close to 40 cigarettes. I fucking hate it, and fucking hate myself right now. About to go to bed, and am literally smoking my last one right now. I fucking hate it. I'm ashamed of it.

I keep it a secret from my family, from my co-workers. I'm fucking done. There is absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. I have let this ruin my health and finances for too god damn long. I'm done. I'm fucking done. This shit tastes terrible. My mouth tastes terrible. I don't even remember what a nicotine buzz feels like. This shit is bananas.

Thanks for listening. I hope to see you guys tomorrow with an official one day flair, because this shit is fucking over.


Sober edit: I just upvoted every single one of you beautiful, supportive souls. Thanks for reading the ramblings of a drunken mess. For the record, I am still very much committed to doing this once and for all. Hell, technically I'm already a nonsmoker.

To clarify a couple of things; for one, this is by far not how I usually smoke(d). On average I would have 10-15 a day. Last night was just different because at first I was with smoker friends hanging outside all night, so they just kind of went down easy. Then, I was home alone, drunk, and feeling depressed, so they went down even easier. I also handed many out, so it was probably more like 30. Regardless, still fucking gross. Second, I "hide" it from my family and co-workers by not smoking at all until after work or after I've seen them for the day. That's going to be the hardest part about quitting for me. Have no problems not smoking all day long, but then 5 or 6 o'clock hits, and it his HARD.

Thanks again everyone. Sincerely.

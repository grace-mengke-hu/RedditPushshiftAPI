Hello everyone ^_^

I started to smoke thinking I wouldn't smoke for a long time. And now its 11 years since my first cigarette. And also I don't smoke much like 5-8 cigarettes a day that was my excuse for not quitting. So 9 days ago a just tryed not to smoke. Every day I m saying if I can do 3 days then I can 4 and so on.. I still don't feel like a non- smoker a can't stop coughing and I really really wanna smoke. But if can do 9 days without cigarette then I can also 10 he he..
Hope I will soon feel better! Also I'm very very nerves and "angry".. ppl are gone start to hate me . Good luck to everyone

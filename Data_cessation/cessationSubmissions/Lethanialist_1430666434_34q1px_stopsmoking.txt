Non-smoker getting cravings out of nowhere for the past week? Help!

I'll start by saying that I've only had a couple cigars over the past 5 or 6 years and I've smoked some cigarettes while drinking socially. Overall I'd consider myself a non-smoker because it's only really been celebratory and not habitual (birthday, etc.)

Over the past week or so, though, I've had this insatiable urge to buy a pack. I don't really know how to deal with it; I've tried chewing gum, walking/exercising, reading, cleaning, and anything else to distract myself, but no dice.

This seemed like a place where I might get some better advice or at least someone to talk to. How can I stop the urge from turning into a habit? I really appreciate whatever support you guys can give.

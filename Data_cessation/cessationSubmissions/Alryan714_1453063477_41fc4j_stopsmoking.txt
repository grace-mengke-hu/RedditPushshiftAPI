7 month check in

Not doing so well. Almost got a pack on friday. Only reason I didn't was I had my daughter with me. I don't want to buy smokes with her. Even though she is only one she still dose not need to see it. It is a couple of days later and I still want to. I am fighting with my husbad to the point that divorce came up and  my dad may have cancer agian. I know these are not good reason to start again so that is why I am trying hard not too. So here I set 7 months and I am not 100% sure why.

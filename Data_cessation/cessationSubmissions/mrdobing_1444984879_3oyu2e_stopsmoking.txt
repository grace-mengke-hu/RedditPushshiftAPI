New Star!

Hey guys,  

Just realised I've got my second star. Feeling pretty proud!  

For those of you in your early days still, KEEP AT IT. It will be hard and you will to and fro, however, think past it to the future. You will be over the cravings, the chains will be broken and you will been fine.  

My mind is no longer foggy from the constant wellbeing bar needing a top up, my lungs are clear and I love being able to breathe, taste and smell again.  

People around me and on here have been very supportive and it has made it a breeze. Also thank you Mr Carr, you may have saved me. Seriously, if any of you are still doubting why you have quit read EASYWAY. You can buy it or even it online as a .pdf.  It will change how you think.  

Just remember you are not gaining anything from smoking. You might have rewired your brain to a point where it feels like you are gaining something. But in reality, you are just topping up your bar to feel like a 'happy' Sim!!  

Join me and many others and do not smoke today. Good luck everyone and thank you.

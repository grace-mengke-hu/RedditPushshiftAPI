I feel restless and scared.

When I see people posting their accomplishments here, I am scared I will never ever get there. The very idea about not smoking again is making me restless. It's only been two days since I let go but it feels like a life time. I guess I have to substitute this habit with another one as soon as possible. I would be grateful for any tips on how to make it through.

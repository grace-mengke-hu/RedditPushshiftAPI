I had one last night, it tasted dry and ashy. Gross. Resetting the badge today.

I've been off cigs since NYE, but leaning on an e-cig a little.  I had one smoke last night with my friend and it really tasted bad (even after several drinks).  I'm a bit disappointed in myself, but the way it tasted was encouraging at the same time.  It honestly wasn't very enjoyable - a bit like the way I remember cigarettes tasting before I became a smoker.  Interesting.  

I have heard people say that once you've been a smoker, you'll never be disgusted by the taste of smoke the way a non-smoker would be.  It's always been a discouraging thought, maybe it isn't true.  I hope this doesn't make anyone else want to test it out.

My husband stumbled- positive affirmations for him?

My husband has been going strong, I’ve been so so proud of him! It’s been nearly 2 months after smoking for 30 years and tonight, someone offered him a smoke at work and without thinking he took it and smoked it. (That’s what he says, but we had a bit of a blue today so I’m not surprised if that’s just a story) 

It’s just one smoke, after such an awesome attempt for him, what things can I say to help him get back in the game! I’ve only been quit for 3 months so don’t feel like I’m experienced enough to offer any real advice so I’m calling on you guys for help! Please!?

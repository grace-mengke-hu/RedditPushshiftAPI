Please help me stop

I'm on day 4. I'm a 20-40 a day-er depending on whether I'm having a drink. I need to stop. I'm on day 4. I decided to stop on Monday this week. It's Thursday now. I had one cigarette on Monday. None on Tuesday. Two on Wednesday and now I'm on my fifth today, Thursday. I need your help. I want to stop. 

All advice welcome.

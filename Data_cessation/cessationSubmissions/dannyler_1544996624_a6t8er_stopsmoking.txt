how my grandfather stopped smoking at age 82 after some 60+y of smoking

a few years ago my grandfather decided to quit smoking. 

he didn't tell anyone. in fact, whenever someone would say "let's step out for a cigarette" or anything similar, he'd say "I just had one", grabbed a pack from his shirt pocket and offered a cigarette to whoever he was talking to. noone noticed. 

then at one point my grandmother noticed he was out of cigarettes and bought a whole pack for him to which he said bemused "**what are you doing? I stopped smoking 8 months ago**".

i love that story so much :D he's been having a blast with this little secret up until then.

and related: I've used a similar thing to stop drinking alcohol. I ordered water a lot and anytime someone asked I'd say "I've had a bit too much the other day, trying to keep it together", "headache", "doesn't go well with meds", "feeling under the weather" to a point where I hadn't had a drink in a few months and never started drinking again! :D but it massively helped that I my friends weren't extreme party drinkers themselves.

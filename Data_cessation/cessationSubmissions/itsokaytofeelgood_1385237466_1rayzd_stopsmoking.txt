Here it goes.

I've subscribed to this sub for awhile. I've been a smoker for ten years, and not even sure why. It's unattractive to those I'm interested in, I don't make much money and it's sad that I spend such a percent on cigarettes, and I really feel lately it's affecting my health a lot more than I thought before. I really respect this community, this is going to be hard for me. Hopefully just posting this, regardless if anyone sees it, will be enough to keep me accountable to myself this first day and the next couple. Thanks folks.

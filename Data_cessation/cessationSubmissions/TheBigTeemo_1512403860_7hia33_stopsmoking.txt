Quit cigarettes but can’t kick nicotine

So I started vaping and I have chewed tobacco for quite some time and I’ve completely kicked cigarettes.

My nicotine cravings are far far less than what they used to be when I smoked but I can’t seem to completely kick the habit.

I can go almost half my day after the morning without nicotine but after that I cave.

My e juice is 3mg which is the lowest I can find and I usually have about 3 dips a day.  

Anyone have any advice on how to cut nicotine out all together?

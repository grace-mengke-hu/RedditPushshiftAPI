Determined to quit smoking but missing it

So far I’m 11 days I’m quitting smoking, smoked for roughly 2 years and decided to quit for health and money reasons. And so far I will say the nicotine withdrawal was short lived. Really the only thing I miss it about it is the oral fixation and the small little habits that came with it I kinda miss. Waking up in the morning before class or work listening to music having a cup of coffee and a cig, the mid day cig, and the cigs I smoked when I drank with my friends. But I know the habit needs to stop this is my 3 time attempting to quit so any advice or does anyone relate to I guess romanticizing the past of little moments in life that revolves around it.

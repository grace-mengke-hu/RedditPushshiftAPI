I smell so good!

100 Days today, and for the past few weeks I have been noticing that I smell really good! I smoked for almost 15 years and I can't believe I smelled bad for so long. My hair smells great, my lotion smells great, and I can actually smell the detergent on my clothes now. Stay quit, everyone!

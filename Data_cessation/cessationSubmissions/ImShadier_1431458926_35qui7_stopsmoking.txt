Depression is the biggest obstacle to my success.

My depression is pretty well controlled now, really for the first time in my adult life, and I'm really happy with that fact.  Days (like today) still come, though, where those familiar feelings of self-loathing creep back into my consciousness.  When they do the **very first** thought that enters my mind is, "I have no worth, life is shit, may as well smoke cigarettes since you don't value yourself/your health/your life now and that's the very reason you quit."  I recognize it when it happens, and I'm usually not so far down the rabbit hole that I can't realize that I won't feel the same way in a relatively short period of time. But there's an impulsiveness that goes hand-in-hand with those feelings that is dangerous to my efforts.  I'm extremely grateful that I'm totally broke today.  Otherwise, I may have fallen back into the dingy, smelly hell of cigarette smoking.

[help] i'm a non-smoker, suddenly craving for cigarettes

i smoked only a couple times in my life out of curiosity the last time i smoked was before 2 years, i wasn't addicted or anything.
now all of the sudden i found myself in need of cigarettes.  i know it's wired, has anyone experienced something like this before ?

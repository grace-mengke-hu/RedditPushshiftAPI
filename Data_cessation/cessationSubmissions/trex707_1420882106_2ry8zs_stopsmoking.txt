My mom has COPD. I live with her and my dad and all 3 of us smoke. Help?

My mom and Dad are late 50s, im early 20s. There is a decent amount of stress in the house. All 3 of us are regular smokers. My mom kept me in te dark about COPD. Shes had it for almost two years from what I understand. Shes tried to quit and we all casually agreed a few times and ive agreed to smoke away from home only, but eventually stress or argument led to lighting up inside eventually and things went back to normal.

Im pretty tired right now, but I just felt like I needed to finally face up to the seriousness of the situation. I fucking love my mom you guys. She raised me right and did the best she could with everything that life threw at her. I have two brothers and I want her to be able to live long enough to hold her grandchildren. My dad e ould be willing to help if I sit down and talk to him. I have to be honest guys, im not sure Im ready to quit smoking completely myself just yet , but I can keep it away from my mom. (Maybe E-cig is an option for me for now? Idk)

Tl;dr. My mom smokes & Has COPD. My dad and I smoke and live with her. 

Hoping you guys might have some advice because Im not sure where to begin. Thanks in advance!

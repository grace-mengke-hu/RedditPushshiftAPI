19 hours and counting

So i stopped yesterday after smoking a whole box in a day....wow. This would be my 4th time trying to quit, as im currently reading Allen Carr's book, and set my quit date 3/27/17 as more of motivation as a gift for me and my dad :P but i feel like i might just go back to it when ever my anxiety kicks in. Also is it better to use a substitute or replacement or go at it cold turkey?

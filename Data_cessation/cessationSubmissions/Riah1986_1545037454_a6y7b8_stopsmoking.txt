Have been smoke free for 24 hours. On Chantex.

Hi everyone. It's my first post here. I have smoked on and off since I was 15 years old. I am 32 now and was tired of feeling like crap so decided to hopefully make quitting smoking a permanent lifestyle change. 

I've been taking Chantex for over a week and it has been working quite well. I've been having nausea, weird dreams, mood swings, and my mind feels a bit cloudy, but overall it's helping.

I downloaded the Smoke Free app and it was exciting to see the first 24 hours being smoke. I got tired of talking about it (quitting smoking), instead decided to be about it. Hope everyone is having a good week! :)

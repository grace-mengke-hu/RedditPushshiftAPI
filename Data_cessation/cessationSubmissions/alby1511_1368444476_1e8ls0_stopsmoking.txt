day 1 of quitting any advice please?

so I've been smoking for 7 yrs now and wanna quit. I'm getting married in 5 months and I promised my fianc√© I would quit before we are married. I've tried a few times before with no luck. unfortunately I'm a chef so I'm always under pressure and a quick smoke break was a great way to chilli out. I need some advice or tips on dealing with it. I want to quit cold turkey as well   please help

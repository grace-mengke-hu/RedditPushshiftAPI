This is my declaration of intent for accountability.


I fell off the band wagon for about three weeks and I am ready to quit again. I have no smokes at home, I have patches and have made sure to shower and put away all ite,s that smell of smoke. When I wake up ing morning I will put on a patch instead of going to the store and getting smokes.

There, I told the world and now I have to do it or I will a douch who does not keep his word.

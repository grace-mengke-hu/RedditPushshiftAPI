Alright time to go all in.

Well I have committed to living the rest of my life without alcohol and I just got through the worst of it. I am on day six, thanks to the help from everyone over on SD.  Might as well jump in with both feet.  I have been smoking for 20 years with a brief 1 year break in the middle.  I plan on visiting here daily to lurk and post. Let's do this!

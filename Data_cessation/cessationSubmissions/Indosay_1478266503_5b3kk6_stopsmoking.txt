Dude, I can hug my mom again without feeling guilty.

I always hid from my parents that I smoked, though I'm sure they knew.  We just all pretended like it wasn't a thing.  So every time I would see them, I would stress out that they would smell me.  I'd always try to mask the smell and hug my mom with only a side hug from the side I don't hold my cigarettes.  I was never really able to just full on hug her out of anxiety that she would smell it and call me out.  For fucking years!

I can hug my fucking mom again without that little stress voice in my head or hugging for only a second before pulling away.  It's so awesome.  Even if there were no other benefits from not smoking, being able to hug my mom again without anxiety is totally worth it.

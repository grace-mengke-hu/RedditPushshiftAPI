It's been 61 hours.

I'm losing it.

Edit: Thanks for all the encouragement! I've made it to a full 72 hours. On to #73...

Edit #2: 86 hours! I never thought I'd make it this far, and I'm starting to get excited about the idea of *actually* quitting. I felt like it was a trial run and didn't tell anybody except people here, but now that I've made it this far (further than I have in 18 years...) I don't wanna start over again! I'll keep pushing!

Edit #3: it's been 144 hours. I just had a couple glasses of wine tonight for the first time since I quit and it nearly broke me.  I hadn't drank some I will because I knew it would be so hard, but my wife and I had a nice dinner at home so I went for it...dangerous, but I didn't cave. 

One day at a time...

Ideas for constructive anger outlets.

As I'm sure all of you know, one of the psychological withdrawals of quitting is a strong anger/aggressiveness especially for people like me who are inherently salty. In my battle to quit I've learned that I haven't developed any healthy and constructive outlets for my anger since the last 7 years I've been a smoker, and it is typically what makes me cave around a week after quitting. What do you folks recommend?

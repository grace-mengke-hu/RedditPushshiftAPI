I caved. For the only "good" reason: I didn't want to quit yet

I went 4 days cold turkey. I didn't want to, for a litany of reasons. I did it because someone I loved asked me to. 
Tonight I smoked a cigarette. 
I know now that I want to quit. And I will, and soon. But I have to have a plan. 
On Tuesday, I decided that I "quit" because I didn't have any cigarettes and I could tough it out. I couldn't. Because I didn't want to. 
I learned a lot in these four days. My will is very strong. I can go days without smoking. 
When I try again- soon- it will be on my terms, and with a plan. Sheer force of will isn't enough. There needs to be a plan, a motivation, a support network beyond the general well-wishers. 
Temporary relapse isn't failure: you learn more, and grow stronger every time you try. 
To everyone roughing it out: Godspeed. 
I'll see you guys there soon. I promise.

Best way to stop vaping?

I started school this week, and I was just broken up with recently. I know my addictions were the reason for it. I smoked for almost 5 years then switched to Juul. Every time I tried to stop, I was just tired all the time and couldn’t really be motivated to do anything. I’m afraid if I stop the Juul now I won’t do well in my classes. Is there a better way to stop cold turkey?

Everyone says that quitting is hard but they never talk about the side effects!

Man, I never want to quit again. For the record, I am *really* proud of my cold turkey quit, I've made it way longer than I thought possible, haven't cheated or really wanted to cheat at all, and I am fully committed to, and excited about, my life as a non-smoker!

But DAMN, no one ever tells you about all of the side effects while quitting! The only thing anyone ever warned me about is "You'll cough up gunk for a bit." I guess it makes sense because if someone was like, "Yo, you should quit smoking and also btw you might have problems in the skin, sleep and poop department," a lot of smokers would just not quit. 

I'm very thankful for this sub. Not only do I get stellar advice and encouragement (as well as the opportunity to pass the same on to others) but it calms my nerves every time a new side effect pops up for me to worry about. These random side effects are annoying for sure but it's just proof that my body is working to push out all the toxins I've put in over the years. Sorry, body!

I quit for 7 months, slowly got back to a pack every few days and now i'm ready to try for a second time

All my friends smoke and i usually goto the bar every weekend too. I still want to hang around my friends and be able to goto the bar. Do e-cigs with zero nicotine help at all? I have been debating buying one

62 hours in. Wish me luck.

Around a pack a day for the last 20 years or so. Sometimes less, sometimes more. I've been unable to feed my children, but still found money for cigarettes. I've lost jobs because of taking too many smoke breaks. My kids are begging me to quit. 

I need this time to work. 

Downloading Allen Carr's book. Thanks for the recommendation.

EDIT - approaching hour 126. Things are going pretty well. Phew! I feel like I'm almost out of the pangs and withdrawals part and into the long-term quitting part.

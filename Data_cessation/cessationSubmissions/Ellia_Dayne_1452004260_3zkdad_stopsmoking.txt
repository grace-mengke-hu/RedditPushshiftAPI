Thoughts on vaping?

I decided to quit smoking cigarettes starting NYD. I didn't feel like I had the willpower to quit cold turkey so I turned to vaping instead. Things are going ok so far and I haven't smoked, but I hadn't really thought of *why* I switched to it instead. I've read a few other people's comments on here saying that vaping technically isn't quitting smoking, which is understandable...

For me, smoking was something I used to occupy my time, I actually enjoyed it, even if my body didn't (just like any other addiction, I guess!). I'm also quite a tactile person, so I know I need to be doing something constantly, hence the vape. My boyfriend started vaping about a year ago, mainly to save money as cigarettes/tobacco is so expensive. It's worked really well for him and he's even reduced the nicotine levels in the fluid he's using over time and is nearly at 0.

I don't plan to touch another cigarette ever again and tracking my vape usage along with other things including cravings and their severity, I hope to be able to reduce the volume over time.

Does anyone else have any experience with a vape as a way to stop smoking? I'm curious to find out if this is a good way to go :)

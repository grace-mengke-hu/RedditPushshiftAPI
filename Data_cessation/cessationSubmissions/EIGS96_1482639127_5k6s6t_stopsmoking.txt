Quit 2 weeks ago, just now started craving?

So I'm probably the odd man (or woman) out here because I smoked loose tobacco in a bong, among other things. Found it gave me a much better head rush, enough that it was worth the awful taste. All together I was smoking for 8 months (every 1-2 hours usually, daily), not very long compared to a lot of people. 

Anywho, I stopped smoking 2 weeks ago as of tomorrow, and all of a sudden today, I've been getting random urges to smoke a cigarette. What the f???

Is this a normal thing? I figured that I was gonna get away without cravings because I didn't have any at all when I first quit. Apparently I was wrong. Anyone else been through something similar? Advice would be welcomed if you guys have any. 

Note: I have no plans to go back to it. I quit my other vices at the same time, no point in holding onto that one. It's messed up my lungs sooo bad too, from the bong i'm guessing. I have chronic bronchitis now, and I cough up black chunks multiple times a day. I'm 20 y/o and I know senior citizens who have better lungs than me. I'm just freaked out over the cravings because I totally was not expecting them at all.

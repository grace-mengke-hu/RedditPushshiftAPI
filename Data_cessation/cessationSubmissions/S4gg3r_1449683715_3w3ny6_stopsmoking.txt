Whats the worst part for you and how do you deal with it?

For me, the worst part is the occassional fuzzy-headedness, during bad ones i cant focus on anything, it feels like my head is full of warm, dry, static-charged cotton and i start to feel a panic rise like when you take a breath but there's no oxygen. To deal with it, i stop whatever im doing, pull over if driving, close my eyes, breath deep, focus on the feeling (i fing its much better to experience the feeling instead of trying to block it out, less scary) and remind myself that the feeling will pass soon. Timing it can help too, helps keep time from getting stuck and making the moment drag on.

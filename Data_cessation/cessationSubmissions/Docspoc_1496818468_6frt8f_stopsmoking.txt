Week one tobacco free.

I have smoked for over 30 years. Not good. I felt quite unwell last week and decided that if I don't stop smoking now I will end up with some awful illness. I use a vaporizer to help. The only time I struggle is when I am with people who smoke although that is getting easier. I really hope I can keep this going. I have no interest in cigarettes now. Here's to the rest of my life tobacco free. I can do it.

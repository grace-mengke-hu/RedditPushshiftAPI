I JUST WANT TO SMOKE! AHHHHHH!

Literally seething right now, everything was going great up until last night about 5 stressful situations pilled on at once. I got through it last night, but I'm still working through those situations today and I am so full of rage it's ridiculous. I'm afraid that I'm going to explode. I can't focus at work and I really just want to go home. I'm sick, throwing up, sore throat stuffed nose, coughing the whole nine. I hate this so much. I just want to smoke :,(

Hi so today few days after my husband of 20 years was bonkers when he quit, I'm quitting. I smoked for 27 years. I feel like I'm losing my best friend the cigarette, I'm crying . I know it's my enemy not a friend but my dang brain. Every stupid ounce it's telling me otherwise. I love exercising so maybe I'll work this beast out my system. I'll be looking up this subreddit a lot. If you have a minute please comment. Hehe I can't really count on my DH as he is still dealing with cravings and I'm trying to quit. Let's kick this habit woman!

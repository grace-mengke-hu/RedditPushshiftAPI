i bought an e cig today

i bought a pack of my usual smokes before class. i hadn’t smoked one all weekend, so i bought a pack for this week. i smoked two of them, and they didn’t feel as good as they used to. i went to a smoke shop after class and bought an e cig and some e liquid. i’m about to throw away my pack (or give it to someone around me who wants it)

i’m ready to quit. i got this.

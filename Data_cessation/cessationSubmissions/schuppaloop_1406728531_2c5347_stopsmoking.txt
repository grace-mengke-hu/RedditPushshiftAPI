2 weeks in.

This is a message for all of you on your first few days.

It gets better. My cravings are not gone, but I'm starting to forget.

A cigarette is no longer my first thought after eating a big meal. It's no longer my first thought when I'm hungry or sleepy. It's a small desire now; not a need.

I still want tobacco. But those urges are fleeting.

Keep it up everyone!

EDIT: I'm pretty sure it's stopbot's cakeday! Happy cakeday stopbot!!

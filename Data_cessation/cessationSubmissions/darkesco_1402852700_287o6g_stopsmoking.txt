30 Days, it's bittersweet at best, it's no victory

First off: Fuck smoking!


Now, I have been at 30 days before. And though the first 9 days of withdrawal isn't that bad for me, I still decided to cheat. I'm using Chantix. Yes it not only works, it works great! It's been 30 days and I have had maybe 3 very mild physical cravings. 


I have quit a few times and never made it to a full year. I often fight through the physical addiction (with or without Chantix). I mean, after all, the craving only last a few minutes. No matter how intense, I can deal with these cravings knowing they will go away. But it's that fucking psychological addiction that just comes out of nowhere. 6 months down the road, when I haven't thought of cigarettes in over a month: BAM!!! I start artificially craving a cigarette, my vision changes in perception and my hands start tingling, my brain starts saying shit like: "you have proven you can quit, let's go celebrate that with a smoke." This doesn't last 3 minutes, no, we are talking hours. And it broke me down to going to the store, buying a pack, then throwing it away and fighting it for a few more hours, or caving and reseting my badge here. This time I will win though, because I refuse to be a slave.


What I have learned:


Never get too cocky. The brain uses that to tell you that you have beaten smoking or that you are somehow stronger than the addiction. Although this is kind of true, the brain can twist that info and use it against you when it needs what it thinks it needs. To those that have the most difficult time with the physical withdrawal, and then you're cured for life, congratulations! For everyone else, here is how I fight the psychological (REAL) addiction.


ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS **NOT** SMOKE - No matter what happens, this is the path to success. Sounds simple but the brain can make you forget this. 



WHAT IS THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU **DO NOT** SMOKE? - Life will be difficult for a very short time in your life. Difficult can also be an understatement, but the alternative is far worse!



ONE VICTORY ADDS MASSIVE VALUE TO YOUR SUCCESS - If you fight the psychological addiction, you will likely not see it again for months. It's so strong it may give you a sense of hopelessness, a fear that you cannot win. This is untrue and another lie from your brain. 



ONE FAILURE OFTEN RETURNS YOU TO A SMOKER - This is obvious and it can also take two or three failures, but it's the first failure that usually signs contract.



and finally:



SMOKING **WILL NOT SATISFY** A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRAVING - The sad but beautiful data is that: Smoking will not help you. It will taste awful, and just re-introduce nicotine to the body. The very drug you have fought so well has once again dominated you. Fuck smoking!

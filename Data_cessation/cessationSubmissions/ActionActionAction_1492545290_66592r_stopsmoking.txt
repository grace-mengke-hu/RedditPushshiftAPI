Another attempt starting tomorrow

I have tried 4 times before but never got past 10 days. 

I hate myself every time I smoke. And that's like at least 20 times a day. 

Here's hoping the best this time. 

I really want to get through this. 

I am planning to start a family soon and smoking I think this has been a problem for my sex life. 

My biggest problems have been the breaks I take at work. Any suggestions for anything I can munch on?

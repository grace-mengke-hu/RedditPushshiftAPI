I feel stressed and Im having a craving that already more than it should.

Hey,

Im currently on my day number 10, and although first days were hard, I didnt had such a big craving like this one. It already lasted more than 5 min (right now like 20) and its all because i feel stressed about a LD relationship where i feel she is getting cold feat. I dont want to give in but i cant get rid of the craving... 

Thx for the support guys.

Edit: Alright i put myself together, im really thankful with the community! Fuck smoking.

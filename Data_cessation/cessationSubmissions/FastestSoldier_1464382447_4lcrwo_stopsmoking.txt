I failed

After nearly three weeks tobacco free I failed myself. A friend of mine and I were on a mountain trip. It was a pretty hard journey to the cabin where we would stay for the night. We were skiing and the weather was warm making the snow really crappy to walk on. We get to our destination, drink some beer after the hard work, play some cards and listen to some rock music on the radio. Basically every trigger in existence for me. Oh, and guess what. My buddy found an old pack of cigarettes in the cabin. I fucked up. Hard. 

Day one again. Been here so many times. I hate getting trough the first three days over, over and over again. 

Edit: I'm just going to add this. Don't make the same mistake as me. Don't think "just one". After I took a cigarette my nicotine monster got replenished to his full potential. The crawings got just as bad as those on day one. From there I caved and started using tobacco for a full week again. The worst thing is, that cigarette didn't even feel good. While smoking it I was just aware of my big failure and I got really sad.

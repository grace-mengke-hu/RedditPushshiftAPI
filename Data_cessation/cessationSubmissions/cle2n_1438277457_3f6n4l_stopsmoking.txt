I am fucking ready

No more questions, I've spent too much time sucking down this stupid shit. Fuck you cigarettes. Fuck you spliffs. Fuck you weed. I'm done with all of your mental shenanigans and tricks to make me think that I can do all this in moderation. I know I can't, and I don't want to. There is so much harm contained in the phrase "just one more" and I see through my own lies.


No more trying to justify my reasons to my smoking friends. No more FOMO. I don't care what they think any more, fuck 'em. If have to be arrogant about it then it is ultimately worth the lesson of arrogance. I will build my confidence up with the natural wealth of health.


I'm ready, lets fucking do this.

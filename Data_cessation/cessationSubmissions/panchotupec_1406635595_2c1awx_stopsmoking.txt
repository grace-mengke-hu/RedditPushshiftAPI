One week

I made it! One week without nicotine , smoke and all the garbage that is inside cigs. I'm very happy with what I have achieved , I'm feeling very good! I have made it through a Friday night without a single smoke , I drank beer and hung out with friends ( who smoke ) and I didn't light a singe one. It was hard of course , but when I got home it felt so damn good to know that I made it through it. 

To all you fellow quitters ( the one who started fresh ) , keep on going it pays of alot!

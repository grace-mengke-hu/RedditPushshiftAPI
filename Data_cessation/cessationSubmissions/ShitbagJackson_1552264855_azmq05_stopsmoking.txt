I have a problem.

So I was detoxed from smoking in basic training. Then, like the colossal moron I am, I picked it back up recently. Maybe its the boredom or maybe its the fact that I am in fact pretty damn addicted to smoking. At my height in college I could do a half pack a day. By this point in my life I am having 1-2 cigarettes per day. I have been smoking cigarettes now for about eight or nine years. So what are some tips to help quit this habit? I have read a number of articles put together online regarding smoking cessation but I figure asking people who have quit/ are quitting might yield different results. For me the biggest trigger I have is the memories linked to smoking followed by stress and boredom related triggers. For me smoking was a huge social thing in college. That is exactly how it started, now its something I'm ashamed of and hide but I keep doing it because the tactile and olfactory feedback I get reminds me of college days. I know its stupid say that, its not like lighting a cigarette up and smoking in an abandoned parking lot will summon those days back but its the biggest driving factor that starts my cravings up after I have not smoked for a couple days. I don't really know what else to say, but advice would be greatly appreciated.

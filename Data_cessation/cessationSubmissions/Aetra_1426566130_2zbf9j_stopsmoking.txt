I'm an idiot. (pity party, but didn't fall off the wagon)

I just realised I decided to stop smoking the week I have a huge assignment due, 8 units to complete, and an anniversary for a bar on Friday night. As if that wasn't enough, my new glasses won't be arriving till next week so I have a splitting headache nearly all the time and my back is killing me for no reason I can think of.

Kill me now *headdesk*

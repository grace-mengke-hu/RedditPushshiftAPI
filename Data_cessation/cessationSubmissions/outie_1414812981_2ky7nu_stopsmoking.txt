Having some anger issues

I am on day 2 (or whatever.  I haven't had a cigarette since noon yesterday and I just got to work (third shift). I have been irritable and short all day, blowing up on inanimate objects and the dog, luckily, since my wife worked all day. Then my wife gets home and Im really relieved to see her but she's in a pissy mood because she had a really bad day at work.

She said she would quit with me, but today was a rough day, so she smoked. While I understand where her mind was and why she did it, I can't understand why I'm still not doing it. We went to meet her parents, brother and sis in law for dinner, and I felt like a nervous wreck sitting g at the table. She seemed fine, and her mood improved since she got to talk and joke with her brother. 

I sat there and just felt uneasy and itchy. Normally dinner with all of them as a group is something I enjoy, its fun, it's always free cus my father in law is rich and generous, and its a good time. But damnit if I wasn't just going out of my mind thinking about nothing but cigarettes. Thank god I had an excuse to leave early to go to work.

Took all I had to not stop on the way to work and buy a pack, but here I sit at work, still smoke free.

I'm a non smoker, but I'm far from being a happy non smoker. Anyone have any ideas to help me deal with being angry all the time?

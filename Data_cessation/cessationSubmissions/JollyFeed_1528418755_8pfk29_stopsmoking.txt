The Days Are Getting Longer

I've noticed I've got plenty of free time on my hands since quitting. As the saying goes, "idle hands does the devil's work". Now I have to come up with ways to busy myself to avoid the blahs. On one hand, this is an exciting phase to try new hobbies and think deeply. On the other, I'm completely lost on what to do with myself. It's amazing how much time smoking takes up in a single day.

Anybody struggling with filling in the gaps of the day after quitting?

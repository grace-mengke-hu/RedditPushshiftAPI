Just had awful news and an incredibly stressful day

And all I want is a cig. If this was me not even a month ago I'd have chain smoked a whole pack by now. But smoking won't help anything, it won't make my problems go away, it's just a stupid worthless addiction, so I'm resisting the urge. Just needed to vent!

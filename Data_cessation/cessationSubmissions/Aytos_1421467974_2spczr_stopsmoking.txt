Smoked a half cig in my dream

Going on day 13 after smoking about 18 a day for ten years. No physical or psychological cravings really, but last night I had a dream in which I half drunkedly, smoked half a cig. I awoke with a sickening feeling that I had failed and I hated myself. Took me a couple minutes to realize that it was all a dream. Is this normal? Will it go away in time?

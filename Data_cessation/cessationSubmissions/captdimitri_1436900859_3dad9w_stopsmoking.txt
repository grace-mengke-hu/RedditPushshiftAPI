Day 2. I'm committed to this, but I can't bring myself to go do work I need to get done. Is this normal?

Hey, I set up a quit date for Monday two weeks ago, and am sticking to it, I'm much more committed and confident than I've ever been. But I stayed home all day yesterday, and it's happening again today. My current customer understands, but it's really weird, I've never been this unmotivated before. I just wanted to bounce ideas off of you guys and see if this is common.

I figure I'll kick my ass out the door tomorrow, but that's what I was gonna do today. Ugh. I imagine I just gotta man up and do it, but I'm afraid of relapse. Wah wah poor me.

Yesterday, I totally replaced my valve cover gaskets, changed my oil, cleaned my truck, went for a bike ride, and a whole mess of other things. Work, however, is a routine that's always involved a smoke in my mouth. It's weird. I got all my tools and stuff together this morning, and got cold feet over it. I hope tomorrow will be better. Day 3.

The price of cigarettes ?

Has the cost of smoking had an impact on your decision to quit? I was a smoker for 10 years until I finally couldn't justify spending the money and I obviously have enjoyed all the great benefits of been a non smoker as a result. Over the last 1.5 - 2 years they started raising cigarette prices every 3 month around $2.50 a pack of 20 and more than that for rolling tobacco. The Average price of a 20 pack of cigarettes is now approximately $22 NZD and approximately for a 50 gram pouch of rolling tobacco $45 NZD.
This was due to a government tax to lower smoking rates here in New Zealand.

How much do cigarettes cost aproximatly where you live? Please help me compile this list by adding your average price with what pack and your country if outside of the US. Or please just add your State if inside the USA. Comments welcome. I will convert cost in reply to your comment to USD for comparison shakes. Thanks Guys. This sub help me quit! hope its all going well for you to!

131 day update, and thoughts

hey everyone.  I'm doing very well, no real urges to smoke(except occasionally if I'm feeling down but they are very fleeting feelings now).

I've been thinking about the failure, for lack of a better word, of our education system to convince kids to not smoke.  Here's my thought.  Too much of it is about telling us all the terrible health and money effects of cigarette addiction.  But what I was never told, that I found out only after the fact, was that cigarettes make you a **slave**.  Teens smoke to be cool, to enjoy the act, to do it with friends, but how many fewer of us would have bought that first pack had we known that we were basically shackling ourselves to tobacco?  

Well, anyway, just a rant.  But I'm free of those shackles now!  The last thing I ever want to be in my life is a slave.

So this is IT?

I came to this subreddit about 2 weeks ago, read all the advice about Allan Carr's book. I got it as an audiobook version and consciously listened to it while gaming. 

Then a week ago I quit. First 3 days I was a little uncomfortable, however the third day was pretty relieving in terms of withdrawal pangs. They got a lot less annoying and I pretty much don't have any right now. 


I have been at it for 7 years, about a pack a day and sometimes a lot more. When I mentioned to my friends that I decided to quit they were all in awe and told me how hard it would be and all that, but up until now I actually thought it was extremely easy. I've never attempted quitting before, this is the only time I tried and I think the fact that I used Allan Carr's book to begin with was a big help. 


I know this whole sub-reddit seems like a gigantic advertisement for the Allan Carr's book, but seriously, pick it up if you want to quit. He explained to me WHY I smoke(d), and thus my rational mind was easily able to quit. 




tl;dr: Quitting is really easy, come at me nicotine! People make it sound like it is difficult but it really isn't. Almost seems like a forced placebo effect generated by the media and perpetuated by the folk.

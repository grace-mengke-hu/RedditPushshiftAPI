Three days down...

Today was the hardest so far. My boyfriend (a smoker) hasn't been very supportive. He has been teasing me and such a lot, so I got REALLY aggravated. I was pretty stressed when little things kept getting me down and it got hard.

But I did it, guys! I conquered my third day, cold turkey... I got a big ol' pack of Big Red gum and decided that WHEN I get through the month, I will celebrate by treating myself to a little spa day. =) Because I will do this! I will defeat the tobacco beast! Haha!

Thank you guys for the support I have received and I hope I can be here for anyone else who just quit! We got this, guys!

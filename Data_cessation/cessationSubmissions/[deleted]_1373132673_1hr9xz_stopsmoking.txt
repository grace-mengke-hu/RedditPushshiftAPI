I'm actually doing it

I've been a pack+ a day smoker for the past 6 years.  I'm 4 days in...this is the longest I have gone without a cigarette since I started smoking.  I have been drinking a lot of water and haven't had too many cravings so far.  I have been pretty irritable yesterday and today, though.  And I have a wicked headache today as well.  I quit drinking alcohol, too.  I really feel better  between being sober and not smoking than I have in years.  Energized.  I should have quit years ago.  So much wasted time and money.

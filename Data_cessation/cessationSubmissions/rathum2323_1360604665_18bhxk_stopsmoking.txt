Kicked the butt today...

I never used to smoke for 28 years of my life. Recently I was under a lot of stress and took to smoking. For the last one week (give or take), I was smoking a lot. I noticed that I had less stamina while playing football on the weekend. I found this subreddit and decided to quit smoking 4eva.

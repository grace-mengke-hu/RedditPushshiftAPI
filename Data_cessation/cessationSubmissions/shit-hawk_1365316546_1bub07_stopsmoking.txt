8 Months, Checking In

Well its been 251 days since I quit cold turkey.    

I smoked for 7/8 years at around 3/4 - 1 1/2 packs a day. I have to say that quitting is just a mind set, either you want to keep smoking or you don't.   

I think the hardest thing about quitting smoking was not the cigarettes but the time I don't have with my smoking friends at work.
Those friendships were made because of our smoking and stayed strong because of it. I used to go and stand outside with them while they smoked just to have those little conversations; but as time went on I went out with them less and less.   
   
 I dont regret quitting, but I dont regret starting smoking in the first place.

Today I quit cigarettes and weed together.

Hi guys,

Yesterday my best friend and me have once again decided to stop smoking anything. We have smoked cigarettes for 4 years and and weed for 3 years, and now it really has to end.

We've both been trying to quit for over more then 1 year now, but after 2 weeks of not smoking anything, we always have an unpleasant event happening to one of us 2 that makes us smoke again.

I really have to stop smoking cigs and weed, because I feel it's holding us back in life: we're broke, it's holding us back in life, it makes all my energy dissapear and it's holding me back to move forward and work out. We both quit 11th July 2015.

Only slight problem I have that my mind keeps fucking myself: everytime my mind tells my things like: hey, it's better to quit the last day of the month, that is a better date, or things like: tomorrow is the 13th, it will bring bad luck and all of those ridiculious things. I don't know why but it keeps fucking me up a bit.

But I will keep trying. I have to study now to be able to save my grades, and I really want to make something out of my life.

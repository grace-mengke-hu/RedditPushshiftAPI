Day 1

Hi guys first time posting I'm tysh 
It's been my second day of not smoking..I know it's not a bigdeal yet because I've relapsed many times but this time I know it's different and I will quit.
Thank you people for posting your experiences it really helps.
Staying away from triggers and replacing activities have worked. I'm away from home looking for a job so it's a bit easier to not smoke in a different environment...will kick this shitty habit that I never thought I would have...full disclosure I am also quitting smoking cannibus..so I'm eating less and feeling down..will get better..I have time and energy now

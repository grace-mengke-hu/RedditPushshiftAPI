Extremely sleepy when trying to quit.

I have been trying to quit cold turkey, but i feel extremely sleepy if i don't smoke in the morning (Day 1 and so on). 

If i'm staying at home then i will sleep for days, where i wake up for a couple of hours and then go back to sleep. 

At work, the sleep pulses are worse and i can't even keep my head straight, i literally fall asleep anywhere (my desk, toilet, cantine,...).

I couldn't stop smoking and i relapse everytime i try mainly because of this, i've seached everywhere and couldn't find help.
Thank you in advance.

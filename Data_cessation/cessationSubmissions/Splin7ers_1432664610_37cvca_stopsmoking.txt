Day 1 - Need some advice, please...

Hi guys,

I've been trying to stop smoking for several months now. I have slowly reduced my tobacco consumption to 4/5 cigarettes a day and I've felt like I was not powerful enough to go further down the road. 

Something happened today though, don't know exactly why but I feel that today is the day. I've managed reducing my daily anxiety and hypocondriac thinking a lot thanks to my new passion that is learning to play blues guitar. I learnt how to play entirely one of my favorite song and it felt like a great reward. I instantly thought about quitting since it will also be a great reward to myself.  I'm smoking my last f**king cigarette as I'm writing this down. I'll throw that butt before I'm finished typing. 

Can you please give me some advice? I've read some things about the side effects showing up after quitting. How can I deal with these feelings, physical sensations? What behavior should I quickly adopt not to collapse again?

Thank you all in advance for your help!
I just threw this last butt and now I'm starting this lifetime journey.

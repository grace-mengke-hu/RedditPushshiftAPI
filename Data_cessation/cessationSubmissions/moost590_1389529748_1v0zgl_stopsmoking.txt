Count your lighters competition

Hi All,

Been browsing Reddit for the past 12 days after giving up (using patches and exercise and its going ok so far). Found its been really useful. 

Thought I had better throw away all my lighters and papers that i'd accumulated over the years and was shocked to see i had 53! Got me thinking, if anyone else is doing a clean out, can you beat 53?

P.S. throwing them all away apart from the zippos which i can't stand to see go.

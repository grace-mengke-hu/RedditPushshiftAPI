What if it's not nicotine withdraws? What if I'm just an asshole and the cigarettes are what made me a nice guy?

Day Eight without a cigarette. Still weaning myself off of cigarettes using nicotine gum and vape (vape mostly; gum only during dire cravings). I find that I'm sort of being an asshole even as my cravings lessen. Could it be that smoking is what made me a nice guy? Or is that just my brain trying to convince me to go buy a pack right now?

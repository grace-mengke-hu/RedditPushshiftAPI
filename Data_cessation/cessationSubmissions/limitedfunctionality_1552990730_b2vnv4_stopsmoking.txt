Rage issues..

Ok so I (m49) made the decision to quit smoking Sunday night. Yesterday I finished what I had left in my pack, so 5 or 6, finished the last one about this time yesterday. So yeah a whole freaking 24 hours..  yay me!ðŸ™„

The main problem I'm having is probably best described as not so much irritability as on/off irrational rage.... to the point of destroying stuff around me (and RIP two knuckles on my hand) it comes and goes in a flash, but have come very very close to telling my disabled daughter to fuck off for just breathing loudly several times today.
I'm normally quite a calm, chilled and rational person and I certainly didn't get like this last time I quit - stopped for 7 years, started again about 4 years ago (mainly to piss my ex-wife off...) so wtf? I'm getting wound up just typing this FFS.... 

Is it always this rough the second time round? Or am I just being a sulky and stroppy asshole?

day five without smoking

it's amazing what i now realize i'm not willing to give up for smoking.  i don't want to give *anything* to cigarettes.  i even get pissed if they give me a canker sore, so how the hell did i think i would take it if they gave me cancer?  when i'd think 'oh it's just a risk i'm willing to take' that was a huuuuge disconnect with reality.  i am absolutely *not* willing to take that risk.  and for what?  some stinky leaves rolled up in paper?  not worth a canker sore, not worth lung disease, not worth a heart attack, or cancer or glaucoma or one minute of my good health.  i intend to make this a serious, firm quit.

I Quit !!

After 23 years of smoking, on **April 10, 2018**. 
#Finally I QUIT !!
This was possible due to all good and helpful people of this sub, and informed that something exists like **Allen Carr Easyway method** 

I want to share **My self realisation** here and hope it might help someone.  

 
Was trying to quit for last 5 years, all my previous attempts was failed because i was trying to get something done without the real objective in my head. I knew smoking was bad for health, but i also being informed standing in traffic for 30 minutes was equal to smoking a pack of cigarette and i was too much brainwashed to generate the determination deep inside me. Allen Carr methods just help me to develop that determination!!
 
&amp;nbsp; 

i have bought that book almost 8-9 month back, went through first 5 chapters in the same night and haven't smoked for next 5 days. But I wasn't getting time to read the book from very next day. 

"you can continue smoking until you complete this book" was flashing all over my head, after 5 days my will-power is defeated and i continued smoking. **Attempt#1 - failed**. 

# Its a **psychological** game we have to win, It's not a will-power game at all. Its the drug doing its thing in our head!!

Attempt#2 with Allen Carr's Easyway

3 month after the first attempt, i wasn't getting time to read the book (or rather finding excuses not to read that book). I got the eBook for myself. plan was to read that while i travel. Again i started to read it from chapter-1 and this time i stopped again in that "nicotine" chapter.. Now i know Nicotine is the most addictive drug in this planet. But still i was failing to find a real motive.  This attempt kept me away form smoking only for 2 days. 

&amp;nbsp; 


**The final attempt**. 8-9th April. 
Searching for an audiobook in youtube/soundcloud, as i was unable to read that book. 

After this **magic** happened. I stumbled a series of youtube videos which re-programmed my brain by showing me reality with facts. And i was able to Quit , **i am smoke free for over 15 days now !!** &amp; will never ever touch cigarettes again !! Its wonderful feeling of being smoke free.

I followed the videos listed above in exact same sequence:

* Setting up the stage - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeRhOsUGM54
* Part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMmjECovWo8
* Part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlNIImkoWPw
* Part 3 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrdhHeu3RP4
* Part 4 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7fNhHsu0UM
* Part 5 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AQXir_diQ
* Part 6 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPVGrv5gTRU
* Bonus Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9S4ojJRP2I

-----------------


Watch them back to back. if you have even an iota of doubt repeat the videos again after 3 days gap. Whenever you feel the urge to smoke see the first video (Setting up the stage) again. I bet, no one will have to watch it 3rd time.

ps: i tried hypnotic method to stop smoking many times, but i didn't felt any difference. Probably i don't believe in the hypno things and its proven if you don't believe on something you wont be able to archive it.

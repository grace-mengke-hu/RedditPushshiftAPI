Ok, this is it, and I need help.

I'm 34. I've only been smoking 7 years. I was an idiot for starting at 27.

My fiancee of two years thinks I quit long ago. She caught me once, and I said it was only a few times, stress, work, all that. I feel awful for lying, and I can't do it anymore.

I'm quitting. I smoked my last cigarette about 8 hours ago and I'm really craving one right now, but I can get through this.

Two questions/calls for advice:

1. I recently moved to an area where I don't know anyone except my fiancee and her friends/family. Since none of them know I'm going through this quitting thing, it's hard to find support. What do I do about that?

2. How do I let my fiancee know that I've been smoking, but I've quit without feeling like an ass and having her be mad and disappointed that I've hid it for so long?

Thanks in advance!

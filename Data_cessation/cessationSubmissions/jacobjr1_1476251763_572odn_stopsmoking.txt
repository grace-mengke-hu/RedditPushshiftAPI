I made this anti-smoking poem back when I was a Senior in high school

Back when I was a Senior in High School, my English teacher assigned us to make a poem inspired by Jabberwocky, at the time I've struggled with smoking for 4 years, smoking as much as a pack a day and maybe even more. To give myself the motivation to quit, I made this poem which apparently blew my teachers mind. My goal with this poem was to create two worlds: The world of fantasy and the world of reality, and in order to break the spell and see the world of reality you have to understand the meaning behind the "witch's" name


The Wand






Occabot Gib, the witch who sells the wand

Heith Occabot, my boy, the wand kimes

The naive have fallen victim to the curse

Trapping them in a Cidda of no escape

Occabot wogs slaves





Noit Cidda, the curse of the wand

Those trapped in walls of slime

 Falter at the grasp of Ekoms

The young warrior faces his match

Charge the walls of Noit Cidda





Occabot knows no evil

Finding victims of her Cidda

Dat is her victim, we are Dat.

Flames are her allies

Willpower is her weakness





The wand isn’t the threat

Noit Cidda casts the destroying spell

Lat Carci is the villainous plan of Occabot

As it might not show in Dat but the aftermath

Especially when those are weak to end Noit Cidda





Lat Carci cargens from within

It is too late for our young warrior to grasp victory

Occabot has claimed her next soul

The mistakes of Dat is the fall of the warrior

From within the machine brings his next breath





Noit Aidar may be the anti curse to Carci

But a hefty price shall be paid when selected

Even the Noit Aidar may bring the warriors soul to Occabot

The never ending cycle of madness 

Is the never ending cycle of Occabot’s dinner





Snap the wand!

Defeat Occabot Gib!

Snap the wand!

You are the next ray of hope

To the next naive warrior

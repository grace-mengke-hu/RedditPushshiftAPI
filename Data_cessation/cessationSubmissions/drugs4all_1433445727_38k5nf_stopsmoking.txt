headaches - what is normal

Today is my 20th day without cigarettes after having smoked for a decently long time. I'm feeling a lot healthier now, but I still have this minor headache that annoys me. It makes it difficult for me to read for more than a few minutes or do anything else that requires consistent focus. Having not been without my cigarettes for so long, I don't even remember what my baseline "headspace" is supposed to feel like. Do you guys think this will improve with time or do I need a visit to the doctor?

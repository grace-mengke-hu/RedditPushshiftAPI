Susan Sarandon offered me a cigarette last night...

...in my dream. And I smoked it. And I woke up feeling super guilty (though super stoked about meeting Susan Sarandon). I'll remember that guilt the next time I think about smoking a cigarette.

That's what I get for falling asleep while watching Thelma and Louise.

Stopped 'inhaling' 5 days now

I'm not entirely sure why... I haven't actually been smoking for a few weeks now, only vaping but I woke up on Sunday and just haven't inhaled anything at all.

I'm not gonna lie it is absolutely killing me and the cravings get more and more unbearable as the day goes on. I wake up fine but as soon as I'm half way through my shift, it starts eating me up from the inside.

I have my vape in my car and every morning I look at it and tell myself I'm not going to touch it and I have been successful so far, just trying to take it one day at a time and prove to myself that I can finally stop.

Has anyone got any tips on what I can do to bypass the cravings?

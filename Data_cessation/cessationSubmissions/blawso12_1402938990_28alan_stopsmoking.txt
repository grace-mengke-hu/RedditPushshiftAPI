Relapse...3 weeks of relapse.

I stopped smoking in September of last year and hadn't had a cigarette in over 7 months. I had a series of bad incidents and a friend offered me a cigarette, then another, and now it has been nearly 3 weeks. I'm not back to the pack a day that I was but around 3 or 4 but I need to catch it before I return to smoking. I've heard the second time around is harder but I could definitely use some advice.

Decided to quit.

Im only 19 years old, in college with no job. Money wasnt a key factor in quitting but i feel its time to at least try and see how well ill deal with it. Ive smoked for over a year now, mainly menthol also. Im at about 24 hours right now without a cigarette and i kinda feel fine. Pretty jittery and sorta anxious. I noticed i'm typing faster than usual right now and i've been playing some fast paced video games and doing decently well. Im fairly active and actually ran a mile yesterday and rode my bike for a couple more miles. 

I guess i'm just looking for tips and advice. I'm craving one right now since i've started talking about it haha. Thanks for at least reading this.

Edit 1: I noticed that ive eaten almost 50 altoids in a matter of hours.

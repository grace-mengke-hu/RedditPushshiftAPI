Woke up one morning and I decided it was time.

Friday morning I lie in bed, crazed by the immediate craving following consciousness. I was too tired to move, for about 20 minutes. I've been wanting to quit for years now, not because of money, not because of complaints at the office of how it smells or constantly being spied on to make sure I wasn't taking a longer break than policy allows, but because I want to start bulking and packing on muscle.

A while ago I managed to quit for a few months, turned my addiction into a cross addiction to food, (deliberately) and put on 20 lbs.. I looked healthier, remember being more confident and overall, happier.

I started up after a big fight with my wife, and since, have been at a pack a day.

So Friday morning comes and I lie their, too lazy to get up, and battling against that morning craving. I argue with myself for about 20 minutes that I should quit, and of course fleeting thoughts like "quit tomorrow" or next week kept trying to resolve the debate. I said fuck it, now or never.

I went from a pack a day. I'm still fighting every hour it feels, and have had a few drags (but haven't given up. Lost a couple of battles, but not the war yet). The haziness makes me uncomfortable like a fever makes you roll around in your skin. But I will keep fighting. Tomorrow is the real battle, since it will be a work day where the stress will try to justify my body's involuntary desires to feed my nerves with the sweet nicotine, but I will fight.

It's difficult because my wife smokes. But I will lead by example. She wants to quit too, but doesn't believe she can. If I can do it, she can too. There are things we want to accomplish before we have children, quitting cigarettes is at the top of the list.

Wish me luck, I will need it.

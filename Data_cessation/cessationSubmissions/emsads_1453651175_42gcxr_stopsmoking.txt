no more tingly mouth

i dont really know what to call it but have noticed that the more i smoke, the more i feel a weird, almost itchy tingly sensation where my back teeth are. i use my tongue to feel around and i can tell that i have cavities. they feel horrible and can even wake me up.

i just realized that i dont feel those things anymore!!
i've always thought that the feeling was NORMAL and unavoidable. what a load of shit.

here's to a good mouth and a better life

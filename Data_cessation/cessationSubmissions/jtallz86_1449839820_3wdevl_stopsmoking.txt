Don't remind me

What makes this the hardest? When my mother (a smoker who very recently moved in with me) tells me how proud she is of my quit, or comments "you seem to be in a good mood without cigarettes", or offers "why don't you go reward yourself for not smoking?". I know she means well but seriously DON'T REMIND ME!  It's probably my worst trigger.

My husband is the only other person who knows I quit. He has seen this enough to know it's best to let me bring it up. I'm not sharing my quit with anyone else unless they figure it out. I don't need kudos- I'm doing this for me.

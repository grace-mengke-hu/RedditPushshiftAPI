One thing stopping me from smoking

Hello all. I need some help. I have been on and off smoking for awhile and read 3 books on quitting including Allen Carr. I find it to be 90% true but the reason that keeps me getting back to smoking is i am way more of an as***** at work. I am afraid when I quit again i will potentially threaten my job with which I have a great position. It's not just the first weeks when I am quitting bit many weeks and months after. I am less cherry, don't want to do stuff and very short tempered with people who interrupt me. When I have quit in the past and then gone back it is because I am pissing other people off and feel miserable. At that point I think to myself I don't care if I die from it I just want to not be so miserable.  

FYI in past I have used chantix which I feel just delays the withdrawal. Longest I quit was 2 years with 1.5 off chantix. I was doing okay but again not cherry and not as successful at work. Nicotine is a stimulant and as an engineer it seems to help a lot. 

I feel like this could be in my head but until this gets resolved I don't think I can quit!

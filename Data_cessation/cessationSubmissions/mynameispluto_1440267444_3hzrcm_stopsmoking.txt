Has anyone else experienced this when quitting?

I have a lot of baseless fears in my life, or seemingly baseless. I'm afraid of flying, roller coasters, large flying beetles... Mostly due to fear of not having control or motion sickness.

Every time I quit smoking (even after just a few days), I begin to lose those fears. The thought of flying will seem okay, or I'll be willing to punch a flying beetle in the face.

Is there any legitimate connection between the two, and ELI5 if there is?

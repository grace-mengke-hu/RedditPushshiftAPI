I never realized how lethargic I was as a smoker.

Lately I've had all these emotions, and I don't really know what to do with them.  Little things that kind of irked me before are really starting to piss me off. I don't feel like it's just irritability from quitting, I feel that I'm passed that. I don't ever want to smoke anymore, but I'm just more emotional in general. There are some things going on with my mother's health (ongoing for a few years now) But today I actually cried a little bit because my mother is old and sick. Not that it's anything new, or that I just had a realization, it seems more like I just feel it now, where before I didnt.
Does that make sense?  I've heard smoking can make you lethargic and apathetic, but I guess I just didn't realize that it was doing that to me.

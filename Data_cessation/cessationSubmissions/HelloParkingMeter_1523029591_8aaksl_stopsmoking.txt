Am I cheating?

I'm used to smoke 40 to 50 cigarettes a day. I have been smoking for 7 years now.

I started using the nicotine patches two days ago, and I havent really had a bad craving so far, although Im using a vapor (without nicotine, just the Juice).

The patches Im using are supposed to be on the skin for 24h, but I remove them at night. My morning ritual is usually having a cigarette, even before the morning pee, but even without the patch I havent really felt the need.

What's the catch?

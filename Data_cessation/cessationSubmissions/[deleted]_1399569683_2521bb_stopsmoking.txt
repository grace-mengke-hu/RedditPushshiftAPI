One year!! I made it a whole year smoke free!

First, I want to say thank you to this subreddit. I was smoking at least a pack a day when I quit cold turkey. I found this subreddit and it  was nice to know I was not alone in the beginning when I was struggling.  Thank you all.  I am going to celebrate my major victory!

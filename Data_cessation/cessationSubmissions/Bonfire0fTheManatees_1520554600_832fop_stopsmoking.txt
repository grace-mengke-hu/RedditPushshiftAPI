Addiction is so cunning

A friend told me that 12-step program mantra, that addiction is cunning, baffling and powerful, and the "cunning" part is definitely jumping out at me today. I'm on day nine of not smoking, and day four with no nicotine (I was using the patch before) and addiction is being cunning as hell, trying to trick me into lighting up a cigarette without thinking twice about it. Ever since I got off the patch, my brain been manufacturing all of my mental triggers, one after another: insomnia, making me stressed out and pick fights with my husband, extreme anxiety and morbid hypochondria, exhaustion, and the latest thing is that for the past five hours I've been on the edge of tears for no reason. All really annoying mental states that two weeks ago I would have dealt with by chain smoking. 

I'm staying strong and I have no desire to smoke a cigarette, but I can't wait for my brain to just give up and accept that the break-up with nicotine is permanent, I've moved on and we are NOT going to reunite. I'd love for my brain to quit with all the drama and focus on more productive pursuits instead!

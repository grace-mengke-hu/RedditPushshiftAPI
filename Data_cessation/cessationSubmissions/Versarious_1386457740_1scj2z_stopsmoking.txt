Does anyone have any experience with the e-cigarette?

Hey guys, I was walking through the mall today getting some shopping done and I noticed a kiosk selling e-cig's. I tried researching on google but all I got were debates about whether they are bad for you or not that bad at all.

Does anyone here have any experience with them? I want to hear from a front line of quitters.

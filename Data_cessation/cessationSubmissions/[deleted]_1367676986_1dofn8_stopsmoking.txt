I am Quitting.

I am 16 and have been smoking for nearly a year, these past couple months have been a stress bomb, and I have been smoking nearly a pack every 1.5 - 2.5 days depending on how I feel. I decided today that I am going to quit, My throat constantly hurts now, and I have a really bad smokers cough. Wish me luck!

Day 5.....

Still no puffs. 

The cravings are weird....I haven't had any nearly as bad as the times I've mini quit before. I wonder if that's because I'm more resolute? Cravings are just a minute or two of "fuck, now is when I would have a smoke" and that's kinda it. 

Got my 50 not smoked badge (on day 3).
Saved Â£50 so far. 
Think of the money.

Nearly to day 5!

 I’m extra proud of myself. In just one hour I will be at 120 hours smoke free! 

 This all started off as what was kind of a dare, unintentionally,  made by my boyfriend. See, I’m the stubborn type, you tell me I can’t do something and I will make sure I do. :)

 The first day I smoked 8 of my normal 20. On the second day I smoked 5. I woke up the next morning and decided I would put off smoking as long as I could possibly stand. 

 Well, here I am, 5 days later and not even a puff of a cigarette. Do I miss it? Almost constantly... but I know each day will get easier. It has. And I know I will get healthier. 

 I’d have to say the third day was the hardest. I felt angery, sad, annoyed. Since then my emotions have mellowed out and the thought of smoking isn’t as constant. The one think I wish would go back to normal is my sleep!! I’m not the best sleeper as it is, but since I haven’t smoked I wake up a lot throughout the night. 

 So anyway, here’s to all of us for trying to make our lives a little better! Good luck guys!

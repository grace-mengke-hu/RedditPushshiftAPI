Decided

I have been a heavy smoker for the past decade. I've tried to quit multiple times, but failed miserably each time. 

I just had a baby boy and I don't want to cause him harm by second hand smoke. 

I am going to stop smoking with much greater resolve and will power this time around 

I need support and motivation from you guys to help me nicotine free. Also any tips to avoid smoking is much appreciated.

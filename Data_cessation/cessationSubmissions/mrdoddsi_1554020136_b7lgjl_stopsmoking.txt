Relapsed on holiday after 3 weeks cold turkey and feeling guilty

Just been on a 3 day drinking holiday abroad and smoked like a chimney. Told myself I wouldnâ€™t smoke but after quite a few drinks I gave in. Reset the counter this morning. Any advice for second attempts as I feel less positive than I did before.

Do I have to give up the herb?

Recently went cold turkey. I didn't smoke cigarettes but instead smoked strictly spliffs (tobacco and ganga). I'm not averse to ganga but feel that I am done with nicotine. Problem is that every time i partake in the herb now it triggers cravings for tobacco.. and for that nicotine fuelled joint experience. So am I really going to have to turn down every joint for the rest of my life? Anyone here on this sub face a similar dilemma.

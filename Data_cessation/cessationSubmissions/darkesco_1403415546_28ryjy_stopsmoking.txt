If only fear worked. And my thoughts on "substitutes."

In many areas including medical, the media, work-related quit4life programs, family members, and the general non-smoker demographic, the logical methodology to cure the addict is through fear. And it IS logical when approached from a non-addict's perspective, but it doesn't work. Well, at least not for me. 


Raise you hand if this situation sounds scary:

You are painfully dying in a hospital. The actions you took to get in this state were created 100% by you and were completely avoidable. Your spouse is crying and has no idea how to survive financially or mentally without you. Your child just turned 8 and doesn't understand how to internalize this torment and doesn't understand why you have to leave them and the earth forever. They are hurt and resent your selfishness! In the final moments of your life you notice a no-smoking sign in the hospital hallway; you face one final nicotine withdrawal as a reminder that you lost your life to the deadliest most sinister drug on the planet.


Of course that's scary, but is it enough to stop smoking. Nope! I lived this situation in my mind every time I was about to fail; I struggled to not smoke but I lit up that damn cigarette. 

Along with many other things Allen Car has mentioned, fear is not enough to convince an addict to quit. If it was, we would all have quit. 


The only thing I disagree with Allen on, is substitutes. Yes, we can and should quit **right now** and **for good.** But some people may need a head-start, a crutch, something! Many 1st-time quitters are not 100% ready to commit to cold-turkey-"let's go to the bar and watch me not smoke!" Hedging against the scary scenario by using patches or whatever is better than inhaling 700 toxic cancer sticks a month. I believe that mitigating risk is better than nothing. If you are a slave to nicotine your entire life but you don't smoke, and don't get lung cancer, isn't that good? Personally, I highly recommend Chantix for the mentally stable with good health insurance, or those who are wealthy enough to afford that shit. 30 days on Chantix (smoking the first week) removed 98% of the physical withdrawal for me. The psychological battle is the real addition for me and I will have to fight it my entire life. It's a fight worth fighting and it's better than smoking.


Everyone is different, just keep fighting! Only the drug tells you that you will lose, and that is a complete lie.  However, if you need a substitute, then I say go for it.

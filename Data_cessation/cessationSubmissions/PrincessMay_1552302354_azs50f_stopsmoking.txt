My job is no longer stable, and I haven’t had the urge to smoke once!

I was told today within the next 3 weeks I’d have to reapply for my position and if I don’t get the job back, I’d have to leave. 125 days out. 4 months and 5 days. 

I would never have guessed that I could cry like a big fat baby for hours today and not want a cigarette. 

I do feel that my emotions are actually much more stronger. It’s like nicotine was holding everything back because it wanted to be first. I’ve never cried so much and so painfully before. I was so shocked with myself. 

Still proud!

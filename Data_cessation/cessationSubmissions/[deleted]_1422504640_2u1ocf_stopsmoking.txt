How can I avoid replacing one addiction with another? Any tricks?

It has been 8 months since I stopped smoking and I have found myself drinking more and more beer, indulging in more food than I usually eat, and even having unusual cravings for recreational drugs such as cocaine. It's almost like I was much healthier and more fit as a light smoker. Any advice?

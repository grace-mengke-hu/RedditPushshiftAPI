day zero

there are reasons why i started, and there are even more reasons why i continued to do it. but none of the reasons seem to be good enough anymore. they were never really good enough. here we go.

thank you for your constant stream of inspiring stories, your milestone posts, and even your freakout posts. your constant reminders of why what i do is horrible for me are why i'm going to do this again, and finally. thank you.

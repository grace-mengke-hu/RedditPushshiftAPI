Morning Panic and cravings. (Day 8)

Hey there. Thanks for reading my ramblings. 
So, day 8. The first week was rough, but it's over. 
But: ever since I quit I wake up in moderate anxiety and confusion, craving a smoke. May I add I never, never smoked as soon as I woke up.
Could it be blood sugar dropping? What can I do to fix it?

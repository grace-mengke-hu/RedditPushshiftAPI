How to quit early

Hello!
I'm under the age of 18. During a depressive episode two months ago I picked up smoking. It was my way of self destruction. I come from a family of chain smokers, so acquiring cigarettes is/was no big deal. I'm alone at home often, too. It turned into a habit. I don't even smoke much, three a day maybe.

You see, I'm a physically active person and I have big career plans. I don't want this stupid habit to interfere with my plans. 

The thought of stopping seems really bad to me but I have to. Any advice?

My friend's experience of the Allen Carr book

So, I've been a non-smoker for 11 years, before that a had a 20-30 a day addiction for nearly 20 years, after many failed attempts at quitting I read "Easyway to stop smoking" and quit overnight. Safe to say I'm a fan.

A friend at work told me 6 months ago that he's like to stop smoking so, of course I recommended "the book" to him. he bought it right away for his kindle but didn't read it. As I'm leaving this job in a few days I reminded him of this last week and said he should really try it before I go, cut to last Monday lunchtime.

Him: "Strange thing happened this morning, I woke up and didn't have my usual morning cig, I just didn't want it"

Me: "really, why"

Him: "well I read the first half of that book on Sun night, that couldn't be it could it"

That was Monday, its now Thursday and he's convinced he'll never smoke again, he's had virtually no cravings and is struggling to explain what's happened to him. He also is regretting all of the time and money he wasted smoking. This is very similar to my experience all those years ago, so I hope he stays off tobacco and I actually think he will.

I kept telling him that the whole point of this method is its not difficult to stop, that you naturally just find that you don't have any need or desire to smoke any more, he was expecting some revelation or trick but of course it isn't there its a very natural seeming thing.

His main comment, was "you said all that stuff but I didn't believe you that it would be this easy". He was totally skeptical but now he's very happy and a little amazed, in fact he told me he only read the thing (and didn't finish it) so he could tell me he'd done it and it hadn't worked.

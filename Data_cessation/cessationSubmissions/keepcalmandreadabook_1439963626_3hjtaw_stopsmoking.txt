Oh my god I'm almost past my first day...

Last successful attempt at quitting was 52 days before caving about 2 weeks ago. Note to self: don't date cute girls that smoke Turkish Royals. Longest streak ever in the ten years that I've been smoking: 102 days or something like that. Note to self: don't live with dad ever again; stay independent.

Quit smoking again. One millionth time. Note to self: it doesn't matter how you end your last cigarette, or what time it is, or who you're with, or if you're drunk/high/sober, or after sex/whatever, the point is to quit.

Status report: alive. Smoking trees after work tonight, feel like I deserve it. Yesterday I quit all day but caved after work and found a friend to loan me a few bucks for squares. Smoked them in a night. Quit at 4AM. 

Plans to: continue. The best method of quitting I found (at least this works in quitting drinking, yay, almost 3 years without a drink now thanks /r/stopdrinking!) is to be exhilarated in being a quitter. I LOVE not drinking alcohol. Today I practiced same thing.

Results: working. No smoke all day, only a few cravings. When I have a craving I remember to drink some water and to remember it will pass in five minutes. I also remember how awesome it will be to do yoga and meditate and run again. Note to self: you are a lazy piece of shit that never wants to do anything when you smoke.

Note to other people who are in same boat as me: **we got this, now go do some fucking meditation and yoga and breathe deep**.

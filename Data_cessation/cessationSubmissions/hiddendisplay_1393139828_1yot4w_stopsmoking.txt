Dem dreams.

I've been under constant stress and pressure since the beginning of the year, and thinking more and more about relapsing and just buying a pack. Normally, I can just tell myself "wait till that one year mark, this isn't forever" as a way of tricking myself through the night. It scares me that I'll never be able to smoke again. I loved smoking.

Then I have these dreams, where I buy a pack and smoke the whole damn thing in one sitting. And then the first thing I always end up thinking is, dammit, now I gotta reset my badge. I'll come to terms with that right before I wake up, and then when I do wake up and realize I don't need to restart anything I'm actually disappointed. 

How awful is that. I'm disappointed I didn't actually get to smoke.

I'm having a hard time you guys.

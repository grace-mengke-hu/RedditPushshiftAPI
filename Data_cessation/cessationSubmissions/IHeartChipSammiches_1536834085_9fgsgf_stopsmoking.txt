Day 3 on Champix...what to expect?

As the title says I'm on day 3 of Champix. (I think it's called Chantix in the US) My doctor has said that I should just continue smoking for now and by tomorrow (day 4) I should be starting to feel like I don't want to smoke as much. I researched this medication before I discussed this with my doctor and I have a discontinuation plan with him in case I experience any negative side effects. So, please, don't tell me the horror stories. 

But my question is...I'm not clear on this whole "Champix makes you not want to smoke" sentiment that I've read about and been told. Can anyone who has taken this drug successfully shed some light on this? Does the urge just go away? Does it make the reward of smoking so negligible that you stop, all while feeling the effects of going cold turkey? I'm just not sure what to expect in the weeks coming. 

Thanks in advance! :)

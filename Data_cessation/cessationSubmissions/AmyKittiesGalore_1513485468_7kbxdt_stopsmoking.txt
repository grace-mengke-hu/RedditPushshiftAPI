At a party

It's my bff's 40th birthday party, going home is not an option but damn it's hard to hang around all my smoking friends right now. I'm sure I'm not going to relapse, I just feel extremely pouty and annoyed that nothing seems like fun without smoking. I know this will pass I just wish it would hurry up. Wah.

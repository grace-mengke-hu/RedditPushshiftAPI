When trying to quit cold turkey I get debilitating migraines. suggestions?

Forgive give me I'm using talk to text.
Just like the title says every time that I try to quit smoking I end up the next day with a migraine that prevents me from driving, working (I work on the phone so call center) etc. I drink plenty of water I've cut back on coffee, I eat.

I can't get into vaping because it doesn't hold my attention and doesn't satisfy anything no matter what the level of nicotine is. I've tried the gum and I follow the instructions but it doesn't help because I feel like I'm going to throw up for the whole duration that it's in my mouth.

When it comes to the actual habit I feel I am pretty good about not wanting a cigarette but now my brain just attacks me.

My roommate has successfully quit smoking but she is able to get Wellbutrin I want to try it but I don't know how much it's going to cost me with my crappy insurance I don't have a doctor  so I don't know how to start with that process, but it's nice to have her support and we've been making the moves to cut the smoking culture out of our lives.

Any ideas or suggestion would be heavily appreciated since I first joined this subreddit I've tried quitting 10 times the longest I've gone was four days but the migraine persisted all four days I couldn't even leave my house.(I was on a stay-cation)

On day 6 of being a non smoker - feeing fab!

Went to an Allen Carr's Easyway class last week, which was great, & haven't felt the need to smoke since - yay!!  Stopped previously for 1.5 years just by reading the Easyway book, but this time, decided that an actual class was the way forward. Quite pricey, but when ya think of how much you spend on cigarettes (I was formerly a 20 a day Regal Kingsize smoker), it's an investment.  Was a bit 'spacey' the 1st 3 days, which is the withdrawal period, whereby your brain is getting more oxygen travelling to it & makes ya feel kinda spaced out a tad, but apart from that, no real cravings, no mood swings....feeling great in fact & looking forward to the future as a non smoker.

Well done to all you other quitters on here....good luck to ya all!

Nicotine withdrawal irritation.. what’s your experience with this? Any advice on breaking the cycle?

Im a few hours shy of 18 days smoke free. I’ve read most of Allen cars easy way and I definitely do not have any desire to light up a cigarette and am committed to beating this addiction, however, I feel extremely irritable without nicotine. Gum is helping for when I feel unbearable to stop me from caving and lighting up to rid my frustrations but I know I’m just feeding my addiction with nicotine by chewing the gum and Id love some insight on how to break this cycle. Im horrible to be around right now. My husband is coping the brunt of it and I feel awful. Help!

Day 3 done! Detox now starting, maybe?

Day 3 successfully done! Had some cravings, but very very mild. 

I did have an unpleasant night, psychologically. Some stuff in my life is far from where I wanted it to be, and I usually would drown the sadness with the choking sensation of tobacco. (Literally. I would chain smoke 3 or 4 cigs until I felt dizzy or tired and the sadness would be replaced by the physical sensation of dizzyness / less oxygen). Now I allowed myself to feel sad with what frustrates me... which I am not used to. Ended up ranting alone at myself (and God, as a frustrated believer), going online to find an old friend needing advice at 3 AM, giving the guy very blunt advice (possibly good advice, but blunt), and then venting to the guy about my own issues. I am not used to this, but I suppose it is progress.

Day 4 started: of course I am tired, but also I have a horrible rasping sensation on my throat and feel like coughing. Is the detox starting now?

Going to make some hot tea.

Thanks for the support and stay strong, everybody!

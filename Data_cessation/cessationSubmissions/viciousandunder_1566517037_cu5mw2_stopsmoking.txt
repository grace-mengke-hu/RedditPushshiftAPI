What non nicotine product can I pop on my mouth to mimic the feeling of a nicotine lozenge ?

I quit smoking 6 weeks ago but found that I'm now pretty much addicted to nicotine lozenges. I love them. Thong is, I qu ot smoking so that my singing voice would improve but these lozenges make me cough and I can tell they might be bad for my throat ( can anyone verify that ?)  

I was thinking maybe altoids might help. But I want something I can pop in my mouth that takes awhile to dissolve so I can feel like I get atleast 5 minutes of oral fixation style relief

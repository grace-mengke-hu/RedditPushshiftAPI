Why do I have a foggy mind? I am only a half a day into not smoking, it feels like I canâ€™t think.

For further description:  it is almost like a film is over my mind. Of course, I am super irritable, but this is different. Almost like I have lost an edge mentally. 

What in the world is going on?  I have smoked almost a pack a day for 20 years (since I was a teenager).

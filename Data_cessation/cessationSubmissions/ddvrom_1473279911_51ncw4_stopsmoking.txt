day 7

I just turned 36 and realized since I started at 18 I've now been smoking half my life so it was time to quit.

its harder for me to get through the work day than it is at night.  I think having the excuse to go downstairs, outside and take a 5 minute break really helped- and I don't have the patience to just go and "stand" outside without smoking.

I went cold turkey- I'm thinking maybe of getting a vape- but at the same time I don't like the idea of just replacing the habit with a new one...

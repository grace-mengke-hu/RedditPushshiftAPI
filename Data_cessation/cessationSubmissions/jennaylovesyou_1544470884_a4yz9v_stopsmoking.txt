Quitting today. For the last time.

Hello everyone. I had my last cigarette about an hour ago.

I have a cold at the moment and I can't afford to call in sick because my team is understaffed right now. So I've decided to quit in order to get better sooner. This is my short term goal.


Long term goals:

- I have a boyfriend who is a non-smoker. Understandably, the smell bothers him and he fears for my health (he also has an aunt who had throat cancer from smoking). I want to quit so that our time together becomes more pleasant for both of us. 

- I will have more energy. Smoking tires me. It sucks the oxygen out of blood. I'm actually quite sporty (Running and Swimming) and I will be able to enjoy those activities more, once my body gets rid of the toxins. 

- I'm battling depression (like everyone else on reddit, duh). I remember that I've never been happier before than when I managed to quit for 6 months once. I want to achieve that peace of minf again. 

- I'm dealing with a lot of stress and pressure. And being addicted to nicotine and feeling guilty about smoking actually just adds a lot to that stress and pressure. Once I've stopped smoking for a while, my body and mind will be able to handle every day annoyances better. 

Wish me luck!

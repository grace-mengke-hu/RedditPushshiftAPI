People who work in foodservice, how do you do it?

I'm a cook at a fairly nice/busy Italian restaurant. As you know it can be very stressful, so pretty much everyone smokes. I quit smoking on Monday, but last night just made me crack, and I smoked 3 cigarettes. I know tonight will be even busier.
How the hell do I get through this?

Just went on a run

So I've been smoking for 4 years now. Today is my first day of quitting and I went on run.
PLEASE tell me I'll be able to run again without nearly dying.
I ran around the block, that's all. I could barely do it. It's been 15 minutes and I'm sure everyone on the block can still hear my breathing. This is a shitty, horrible experience.

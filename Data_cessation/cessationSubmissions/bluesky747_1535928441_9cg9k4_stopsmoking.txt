I think it's finally time to be done with this.

I've been smoking for going on seven years now, and I have tried to quit a few times. It never really sticks. I love smoking. But as I sit here smoking the cigarette I so desperately craved, I find myself oddly turned off. Like...it's ok. But meh. Im sort of forcing myself through it. 

You ever have a relationship where you loved someone so much, and then one day something clicked, and you saw it with new eyes, and suddenly, it just wasn't doing it for you anymore? That's how I feel right now. I have like four left...I think when I go inside I'm going to throw them out.

8 days quit. Exercised for first time in 2 years yesterday . Heart rate was crazy and bad headaches. Firefighting goal seems impossible. How long before you saw improvements?

This is both questions and a bit of a rant

Sorry if I’m a bit r/titlegore . I just woke up and haven’t had coffee.

I smoked for about 2- 3 years after my father passed away. I’m 8 days quit.  I used to be in great shape and quite active until I started smoking. I haven’t worked out in 2 years.

My motivation is that I want to become a firefighter, and I need to be in extremely good shape. You have to pass a CPAT (candidate physical assessment test) in order to be accepted to fire academy.

Well, I kept putting off physical training because I couldn’t quit. I’m 8 days in now so I went to the gym to get started. 

Well, not 20 minutes in a very slow jog on the treadmill, and 10 minutes slowly on the step machine, my heart is racing off the charts and my head is killing me. I managed to do some bicep curls but then had to quit.

I’m broken hearted. I did this to myself, but I have such a long way to go, and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to be in good physical shape again. Hell, for firefighting, I have to be in *extraordinary* shape. 

Now I have a hard time breathing, headaches, aches pains.

I’m a 30 year old female btw

TL;DR to My long drawn-out question: how long did it take for your heart rate to come down and for exercise to become easier? Did it become easier? Are you in the same physical shape as you were before?

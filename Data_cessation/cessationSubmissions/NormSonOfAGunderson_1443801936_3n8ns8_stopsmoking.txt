After realizing I'm past my 2 year mark, I am concerned that my lungs still get very congested/sick when I have a cold...

Compared to when I was a smoker, when I have a cold, my lungs get very congested and sick.  It's been 2 years so I'm wondering if this is happening to anyone else?  Or if anyone knows why this happens?  Is there any actual science behind it?

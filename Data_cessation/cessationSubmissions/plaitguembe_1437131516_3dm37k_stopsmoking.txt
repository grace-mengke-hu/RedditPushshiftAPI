I chain smoke when I drink and wake up hating myself

I have been checking out reddit for a while now but only recently made an account. I started smoking when I was about 16-17, in the UK. That makes it about 7 years. I have been backpacking in South America (currently in Rio de Janeiro!) and therefore smoking straights all the time since they are cheap and easier to deal with than rollies. 

Some days I can go all day, or even 2 days without smoking a cigarette but as soon as I have more than one drink (hard not to when you live in a hostel!) I can chain smoke up to a whole packet in one night. It's disgusting! I wake up feeling tight chested and all my clothes stink. I really want to stop for good but I realized I smoke when I'm bored or nervous in social situations-sometimes just to give my hands something to do! Would an e-cig be better? Or should I get some patches to wear when I'm drinking? I have never used them before so I'm not sure.

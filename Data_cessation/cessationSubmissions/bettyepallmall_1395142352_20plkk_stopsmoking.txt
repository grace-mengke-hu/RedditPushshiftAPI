For the second day in a row, I woke up before my alarm clock!

I'm only on day 4 but I've seen some very drastic improvement in my energy level. When I go to sleep I actually wake up feeling rested. I honestly don't remember the last time that happened. I was tired all the time, even with a full nights rest. Well it's time to tackle day 4. I'm feeling optimistic!

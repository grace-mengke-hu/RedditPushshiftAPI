Over a day in

Hey, everyone. It's been a day and a half since I quit most recently. This is the *n*th time I've quit (can't keep track anymore), but I'm hoping it'll be the last time I have to.

I'm going cold turkey. No ramping down, no patches, no nicotine at all. It's been pretty rough so far, but everyone in my life is super supportive. Having some support from people that know what I'm dealing with is important, too, though. I've never really had that before.

Any fun tips that I may not have thought of or tried before? I'm trying to avoid munching a lot, since I also don't want to put on a lot of weight; there's more than a little extra already.

Thanks, everyone!

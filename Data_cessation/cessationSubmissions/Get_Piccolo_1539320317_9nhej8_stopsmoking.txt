Day 6 complete. Feel like I've got the flu and been called in by the doctors for an emergency appointment after getting blood tests earlier.

Got a 'really low hormone level' but that's the only information I was allowed over the phone. Now I'm not sure if the flu symptoms are withdrawals or I'm actualky sick with something else. Have no energy to move and starting to panic a lot.

I love my extra money!

I'm at 8 days. I have saved around $40. Two nights ago I tried a new Mediterranean place . Tonight I had gas money to drive 4 hours to help a friend. I still have $15 left that I would have normally given to big tobacco. Instead, a local business, my buddy, and I were all able to be get good vibes by my attempt at beating an addiction. I have to keep thinking about this because my buddy smokes my brand of cigs and damn do they look good. Another week and a half and I'll be at nearly $100 I didn't spend on a slow death! I saw someone posted a trip through Europe with funds saved up. Another posted about being able to make his car payment. What are some cool ideas you guys have for your savings?

I messed up this weekend, but feel like I learned something and trying to be positive

I caved this weekend and smoked (I’ve learned that my triggers are alcohol and boredom). I was disappointed in myself but then I reminded myself that i never thought I’d be able to quit for 11 days, and I did *that*....

I asked myself after my cig, “do you feel better? Was it worth it?” and the answer was NO. Going to remember that feeling next time I have a craving. 

anybody want to share something they learned from a time when they lapsed in quitting? give us your knowledge!

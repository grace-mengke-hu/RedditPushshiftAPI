This suuuccckkksss

Day one here, I'm on the patch, chomping down trident and toothpicks. My job is so stressful, what should I do? ugh 

EDIT: Work day is over, I made it. Thank you all for the encouragement and tips. I'm sure I'll face new challenges at home tonight, but most likely less stress. I'm also sure I'll be posting tomorrow. Thanks again.

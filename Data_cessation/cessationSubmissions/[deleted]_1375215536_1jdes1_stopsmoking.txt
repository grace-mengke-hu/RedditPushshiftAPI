What are the health risks of not inhaling

I have been a pipe and cigar smoker for 4-5 years and have yet to find studies which discuss pipe smoking or cigar smoking exclusively.

I don't know if I want to quit or not because I have no health issues and relaxing after work with a smoke is great.

I smoke a bowl or two a day (about 30min per bowl) and mostly skip smoking on weekends. I get minor withdrawals on Monday if I don't repeat the cycle but it goes away by Tuesday. My mouth has no problems and my lungs are fine because I don't inhale.

Feeling like buying a pack

I think I am depressed. Or have been for a while now. I used to spend most of my time stressed about something. Something that happened in college, something I need to change about my life or just about myself in general. There were very few moments in my life was actually happy.  
 
Anyway I stopped smoking about 3 weeks ago and suddenly a couple of days ago I started feeling more happy. I don't know if this is related do smoking or related to some other things that changed in my life but it just feels like I can see things more clearly now, I feel that whatever I was worrying about has passed and I'm in a new part of my life now.  

I'm feeling really good, but the problem is I'm also feeling a strong urge to buy a pack of cigs because of this (to celebrate).

Anyone else feels like this?

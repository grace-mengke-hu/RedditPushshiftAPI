I want this!

I'v gotten to a month before i'v smoked 1 cigarette a week for the past 1 1/2 months. I am sick of feeling anxious and tense the first 3 days after that cig. 

I am going to stay active in this sub , helped me a lot the time I got up to a month and this time im going to stay off cigs for good.

Much love for you guys <3

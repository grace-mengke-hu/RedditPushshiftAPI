Day 1 after 11 years of smoking!

Hi everyone,

i am a long time lurker and as the title says this is my firts day smoke free after 11 years of smoking 2 packs a day. 

I am 26 btw.

I am not quiting cold turkey, i tried that and that would just cause me to have a nervous breakdown so i am using some anti smoking pills. Don't  know if they will help but i know i want to give it my best shot this time. It feels like i have been trying to quit for at least five years and that thought really makes me feel like the count of Monte Cristo who is trying to escape his prison.

Everyone around me smokes (i am from Serbia and people here smoke almost everywhere) and it feels like because it doesn't have as big of a social stigma here it's like playing a video game on the hardest difficulty. But i played it before and i now know all the levels except the last one: being smoke free forever. I don't know why i am using this analogy, i am not even that even big of a video game player but all i know is that i somehow feel it fits with the way i see the whole quit problem.

 Just wanted to say that you guys and gals and your stories really do help when the urges kick in. 

Keep the nicotine monster out! 

Take care of your lungs and body! 

We can do this!

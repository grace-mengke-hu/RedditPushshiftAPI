Quit smoking question

So I'll start by saying I've quit for about 4 days for vanity reasons (tired of people saying I look tired/smelling like smoke, etc.) I've been weening myself down for about 2 weeks and I've now gone completely to an njoy ecig of which I go through one pod about every 4 days. My question is, I've noticed a lot more hair fall in the shower than normal. Whereas when I was smoking 1 pack per day I'd lose about 15-30 in the shower(yes I count them). Just yesterday I lost about 80. Is this normal/has anyone else experienced this and can I expect it to get better?

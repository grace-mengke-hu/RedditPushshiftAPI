I want to quit smoking but my girlfriend keeps messing up my plans.

I have been smoking for 7 years and have decided that it is time to quit. Two weeks ago I set aside a weekend when my girlfriend, whom I live with, was going to be out of town. She ended up coming back home early on Saturday night. I had not smoked for over 24 hours and was a little on edge but really wasn't craving a cigarette at all. Instead of supporting me she starts an argument with me because she was frustrated her plans fell through. I ended up getting pissed off, pushing my quit date out to this coming weekend when she is going out of town again and buying a pack of cigarettes. She now wants me to come camping with her and her family and I told her that I would but because I plan on quitting I don't want to be on edge and accidentally be rude to her parents. How do I make her understand that I really just need to be alone for one weekend so that I don't get in an argument with her or her family during the first few days of my quit? It seems like me quitting is always "inconvenient" for her and she "doesn't know if she can handle me quitting". Sorry if this is not the best place to post but I would love some suggestions.

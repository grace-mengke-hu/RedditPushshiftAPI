Got to stop smoking. What do I need to do?

Ok so not new to quitting.  I've done it before but only lasted about 6 months.  Have tried the patches and such, but pretty sure I'm more addicted to the actual smoking not the nicotine.  It is so engrained into my daily routine that there is a cigarette for everything. Car, after eating, first thing in the morning ect.. you know what I'm talking about. What helped you overcome the almost obsessive compulsive side of the smoking?(thats what it feels like to me) Any and all tips are a great help thanks.

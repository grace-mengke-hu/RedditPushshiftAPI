200 days today!

Hey guys! Just wanted to post that I’m at 200 days quit. It’s been good mostly. I’m on vacation at the moment to a place we always go every year. The triggers hit like a ton of bricks. To the point that I wanted to blow over 6 months of quit. I didn’t and keep trucking through each day. I post this to let you guys know not to let your guard down. Even 6 months in. The cravings pass but not without the stress and anxiety first. At home, I’ve been doing great. So I guess you just have to make it through all familiar situations and settings. Can anyone else relate?

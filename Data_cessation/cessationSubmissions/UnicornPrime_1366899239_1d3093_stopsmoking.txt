Day 3? 4? So irritated I'm losing count...

Last night was the worst. I blew up like a hormonal nutcase at my boyfriend. See, i picked this week to give up ALL my vices- smoking (both cigs and trees) started a keto diet, gave up cola... I figured after a week I'd be free of the cravings for any of that.  It has been half a week and now I'm a foolish mess! Very tempted this morning to stop and buy a loosy.   I never knew i could feel emotionally WORSE than PMS!

It has been 5 days and I am confused and proud. (Kind of a rant, but mostly of pride.)

On April 30th I decided I would stop smoking. I am 21 and have been smoking since I was 16. I finished my cigarette and threw away the pack with 19 left. It felt weird, like I threw something of great value in the garbage. It was hell for the first day since I am in the middle of moving. I kept telling myself not to smoke and gave in the next day. I had a half a smoke and then put it out, disappointed in myself. Since the first of May, I have not smoked at all and I could not be happier. I am in art school and I have a girlfriend that smokes, so the temptation is literally everywhere. Many of my friends smoke and I am constantly around it but have somehow abstained for 5 days. The cravings were pretty terrible the first few days but I have not noticed a single craving today. 

That is my first question, is that normal? After only 5 days I feel disgusted by them. I was talking to a friend before class and he was smoking... it smelled horrible. I used to adore that smell. It was like smelling a dear friend you hadn't seen in a while (that sounds weird). So yeah, is it normal to have that reaction to cigarettes after only a few days of not smoking?

Second question: I have heard that your body recovers in many uncomfortable ways so i have no idea what to expect. One thing i have noticed is some soreness a few canker-sores, or that's what they feel like. I never got them really, a canker sore every few months was a normal thing and they always went away. Now I have two and the tissue around my molars is very sensitive and feels like a thin layer is peeling off. Is this normal/expected? As a recovering smoker the only thing i can think of is "OH MY GOD IS THIS CANCER!?!?!?!?!?"

that is all.
thank you for reading. and cheers to you all, stay strong.

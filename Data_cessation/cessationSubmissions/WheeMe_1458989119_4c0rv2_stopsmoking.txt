I've finally done it, the first night.

As I've said several times, the first night is something I just couldn't seem to be able to do without relapsing. Well, guess what? I did it, I have a flu and I just fell asleep after a day of not smoking and I'm on day two and I'm still not smoking.

Thought of getting through the first night was a huge mental monster for me, but now that I've gone past it, I feel like this is a piece of cake and I can accomplish anything. It was way easier than I thought it would be. 

Did you guys have any mental monsters you thought you couldn't beat and how did you end up beating them?

Day three

I officially start day three in one hour, and I seem to remember this being a tough time last time I quit which was in January. I've had far less Cravings this time, maybe 2 a day. I wonder if my last quit prepared me. I wasn't as anxious about quitting because I knew I could do it. And that it wasn't as miserable as I thought. Just reading the posts here and appreciating this sub! Thank you everyone.

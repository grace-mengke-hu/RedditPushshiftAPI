My will gets a LOT of exercise

Who knew that not doing something would be such a struggle?  The struggle part of it comes and goes; today was particularly unpleasant for me.  But I made it home without stopping for smokes.  I live another day!  Lately, the ol troll brain has been making an nagging & rather unconvincing argument that I can smoke sporadically.  I know it's not true.  It's just annoying to put up with.  I also know that the nagging will go away.  Still annoying though!

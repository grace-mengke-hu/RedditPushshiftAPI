Well, it's been a year!

1 year ago today, I had my last cigarette after 10 years of smoking close to a pack a day. 

Quitting smoking was the...most difficult thing I've ever done (giving up carbohydrates is 2nd!), and the most rewarding as well. By not letting cigarettes take priority my life, I gained control of aspects of my life I never knew I had lost. I feel healthier, I can breathe, my teeth look great, my skin (although always amazzing) looks fabulous. I don't stink, my car doesn't stink, I didn't have to run out in the cold/rain this winter to have a smoke every 15 minutes.

Lastly, I now know that if I can quit smoking cigarettes, I can do ANYTHING I put my mind to. Here's to the rest of my life!

EDIT: I also need to state that I'm happy that I can actually allow my friends to smoke around me without wanting one. The smell is oddly comforting, but I will never have one again.

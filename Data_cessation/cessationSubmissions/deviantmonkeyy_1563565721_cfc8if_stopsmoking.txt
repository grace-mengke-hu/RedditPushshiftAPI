I gave in

Longtime lurker of this sub, this is my first time posting but I  need words of encouragement or just to let this out there. I sucessfully quit 2 months ago after smoking for 5 years. Been on and off since January but 2 months ago I put my foot down and quit. But today was my 21st birthday, I drank quite a bit and out of habit when my friend was outside having a puff I decided to light one up. Didn't regret it immediately after but am starting to regret it now. I just feel like I fucking failed again honestly. I just felt like i came so far and I don't know why i didn't stop myself. Anyways just wanted to let this out. Back to day 1.

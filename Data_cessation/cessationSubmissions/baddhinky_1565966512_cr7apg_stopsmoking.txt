I’m afraid my SO is starting back up..

My SO and I quit smoking within a couple weeks of each other. We both have about 1.5 years under our belts. She has been in a pretty stressful work situation for the past couple weeks. It started with an occasional cigarette on really bad days. She said she wouldn’t buy another pack, but she did. And then another. She is now smoking a couple cigarettes at the end of every day. I smoked much longer than she did, so I know what it’s like to quit and then start back up. It can be a slippery slope. 

How can I encourage her to get back on the bandwagon with me? (Without sounding like a total nag).

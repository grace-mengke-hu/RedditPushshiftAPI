4 weeks smoke free- it gets better. Keep going :)

Just a wee post to celebrate 4 weeks smoke free. If you're struggling keep with it it gets better. Stuff that's helped me:
1. Patches. I'm reducing the dose fairly quickly and planning to be nicotine free by week 8, but they do help take the edge off. 
2. Craving? Distract and delay. I've got a list of things I can do to distract myself if I've got a craving I'll tidy something away or most of the time spending 10 minutes on here does the trick. 
3. Tell people you've quit. I've found most people have been really encouraging which has helped. 
4. Save the money. I'm going to save a years worth of cigarette money and then spurge it all on a luxury treat. 
5. Celebrate your successes and reward yourself for them. Little things are great like scented candles or a new moisturiser - enhance the stuff that that's better without fags. 
6. Friends and family. Most are encouraging and I'm grateful for their help. 

To anyone that's struggling - keep going. It gets easier every day smoke free is an achievement. :-)

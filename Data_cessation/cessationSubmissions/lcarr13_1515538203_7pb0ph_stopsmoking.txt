Joints after quitting

I quit smoking and haven't touched a cigarette in 5 days, I wasn't the heaviest smoker before but it was steadily increasing, up to about 8 a day before I quit. I am also a moderate marijuana smoker, with that being far more irregular than my tobacco intake. I roll joints and mix it with tobacco, but have thus far been wary of doing so ever since I quit. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this and whether smoking a joint mixed with tobacco to make it burn easier would be likely to make it harder to quit, or should I be fine as long as I'm not smoking it for the tobacco?

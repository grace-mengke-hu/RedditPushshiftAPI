Starting over...

I had my last smoke last night, but requested a badge for today since that will accurately count days. 

I was quit for 9 months in March, but I started again when I got a job at the local airport where I started smoking 5 years ago. The 12th of July would have been a 1 year.

Why I ever came back to the horrible habit of smoking, I can't remember. All I know is its now ruining my life again, and I'm ready to quit for good. 

Happy Quitting, everyone!

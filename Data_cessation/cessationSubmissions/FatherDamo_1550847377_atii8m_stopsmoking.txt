Day 3, some observations

All, I've quit before and this time is much easier based upon, I think, ramping down to ultralights before pulling the trigger. I had moved down to Camel Turkish Silver, they have 1/3 the nicotine and tar of a standard camel. So if you are planning on quitting "some time in the future", start the ramp down to ultralights now.

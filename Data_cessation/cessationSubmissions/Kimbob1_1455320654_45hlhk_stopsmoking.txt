Why won't my husband quit with me?

This is the fourth time I have quit smoking,  I have always gone back to them because they are just there on the table. My husband wanted to stop, the expense was annoying him. I really need him to stop, he coughs his lungs up every morning,  he is wheezing in his sleep.  Day 6 smoke free and I can't even look at my husband, I am so disappointed in him not trying, not supporting by going on this journey with me. How do I get past this?

7 days... the RAGE

I quit smoking like a year ago, but continued vaping.... now iâ€™m off nicotine completely, and have been for 7 days.

the RAGE.... the inability to concentrate.... the anger and self loathing...

Seriously, I already stopped smoking a year ago, how can nicotine  by itself w/o the tobacoo MAOIs be so strong?!?!!!

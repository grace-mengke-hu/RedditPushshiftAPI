Quitting smoking has taken away my appetite.

Hi, my name is Lee and I quit smoking 9 days ago after 8 years of pack-a-day smoking. I'm 23 and trying to take care of myself for the first time in my life. I've been *trying* to watch what I'm eating and doing jujitsu a couple nights a week. I can admit I don't *want* to quit, though I want more than anything to be healthier.

In this past week I haven't been able to eat nearly as much as usual. I can say that I usually don't eat when I am depressed, and this is probably the cause of my current weight. I'm usually in good spirits. Is it possible that I am going through a depression, concerning the lack of nicotine? I have been very anxious and have been kind of scared to be around people too long. Last time I tried to quit (Lasted 1 week,5 years ago) I had just become a very angry and kind of violent person. 

Is it normal to go into depression just from quitting or do you think it could be something else?

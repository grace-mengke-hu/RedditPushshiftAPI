Day 9. It's getting easier, but not much.

My face isn't twitching as much, and I'm a little less anxious, but I'm definitely still anxious and twitching, just not as bad. My sinuses are swollen too, I'm unsure if it's related. 

I also quit pot. Double whammy of negative feelings. I need someone in a cigarette costume to come hold me and wipe away the tears.

What can I do to regain concentration?

I quit smoking a little over a month ago, but I'm back in school now (law student) and am finding it incredibly difficult to concentrate. When I'm reading for class, I can't help but think about taking a quick smoke break like I've been doing for the last 5 years (essentially since I started college). Any tips for concentrating on assignments without dwelling on the possibility of a smoke break?

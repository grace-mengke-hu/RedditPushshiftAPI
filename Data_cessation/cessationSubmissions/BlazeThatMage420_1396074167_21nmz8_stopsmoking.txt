Fuck I don't know if this will work. Please encourage me

I quit today at 7am 'officially'. I had a cig at 6, bought a new pack, and haven't opened it.

I've done a lot today and been relatively okay. I got out of the shower and didn't smoke. I had court today and didn't smoke before are after. I got a haircut and didn't smoke. I drove and didn't smoke. I had sex and was play not lighting up immediately after.

I went to a bar tonight to watch a ball game and ate a decent sized meal and didn't smoke. I had a few beers and a couple shots and was okay and even went out with people smoking so we could keep talking.

"This is great, I can't believe I can do this"

I'm laying at home right now, fairly sobered up at 1am and it is starting to get hard. I smoked a pack a day for 1/3 my life. If I have one now I still made a major accomplishment. Maybe I can just get a taste by hitting it once or twice and sooth my throat. Maybe I can burn one like an incense and just not smoke it.

So many excuses to just open my pack and smoke. Goddamn I want to. Just one and then I'm back to quitting. But I know it can't work that way

"Maybe I shouldn't quit so fast. If I cut down to a few a day that's still really healthy compared to a pack a day"

Fuck. 

I just want to make it 24 hours. This is currently the longest I've went without a cig since my first month. I just want a full day to know I can. But then what? Just another day to look forward with no reward that picks me up? And then another. And then more and more without that taste or feeling that I'm used to rewarding myself with.

I feel so determined to not smoke and I have no intention to. Not today, or tomorrow, or next week. But I still feel hopeless as fuck

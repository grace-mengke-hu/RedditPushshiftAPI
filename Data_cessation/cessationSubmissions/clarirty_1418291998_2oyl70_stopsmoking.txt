Today I had my last cigarette

I have been trying to quit for about a year now , I haven't bought a pack in about a month however I have bummed a few cigs during that time. I need help and support to finally kick the habit so I hope to find the encouragement I need here. Any tips will be greatly appreciated. I felt like I was free from them right before I ended up asking for one .I refuse to light another one up .

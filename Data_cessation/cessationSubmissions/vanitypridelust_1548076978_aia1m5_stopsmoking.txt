I almost bought a pack last night

Just out of habit - I didn't even want one. Went into the gas station for a soda and to put money on the pump and when the cashier said "That'll be all?" my brain short circuited for a sec "Oh and a pack of Mav.... You know what, nevermind. Thanks :)" 

It shook me up a bit that it's so ingrained but I'm happy I caught myself.

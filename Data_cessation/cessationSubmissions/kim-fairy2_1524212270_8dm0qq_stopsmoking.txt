I kinda feel like I smoke out of a wish to harm myself

Does anyone else experience this? I quit smoking, I rarely have any cravings. Except when I'm really drunk. It's been a long journey but I really made it, I don't need smoking.

But when I feel bad, mostly when I'm having or had a fight with my bf, but also when I feel bad about something else, I smoke. And it helps sometimes.

It's not like I crave smoking anymore. I know smoking can temporarily make you feel better but it's not that. I actually kinda hate it, even.

I think I smoke when I hate myself, or when I realise I'm not perfect and don't know how to deal with that. Smoking feels like a screw you to myself, a kind of rebellious act, like, you suck so you  better smoke.

Maybe it's just some way of trying to n√≥t be perfect instead. I don't know. I just want to know if anyone can relate.

I still quit, i'm not addicted anymore. So that's good :)

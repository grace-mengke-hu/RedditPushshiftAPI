Advice for more addicted smokers

Not to be dramatic but I wanna hear some advice from smokers who started young. Idk if any of you know where albania is but cigarettes is embedded in our culture. I started at a quarter pack at 14 and reached a full pack at 16. I am now smoking a juul pod a day instead of cigarettes but I cannot go without some form of nicotine. I know if I keep going itâ€™s going to get much worse. Patches or gum? Anyone tried naltrexone? I am 20 years old. I know it seems young but my addiction is heavy.

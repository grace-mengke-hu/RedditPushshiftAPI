Friends and Smoking

I stopped smoking 3 days ago . I have read Alan Carrs easyway book . Most of my friends are smoker and with most of them , we first met at some smoking corner or smoking is somwhow related for our spending time together . It feels like my friends won't be like we always been if I continue to not smoking .

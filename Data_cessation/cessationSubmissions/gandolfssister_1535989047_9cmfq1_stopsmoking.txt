Passed a Big Hurdle

Back in the day, my sister and I would get hammered and chain smoke. It was how we would hang out when we visited each other. Last night she came over and we proceeded to drink way to much and chatted until the early hours of the morning. She was smoking the whole time and I barely thought about it  I didn't smoke a single one! I'm so happy I didn't give in and I think I've finally found myself comfortable not smoking. Just wanted to share my achievement!

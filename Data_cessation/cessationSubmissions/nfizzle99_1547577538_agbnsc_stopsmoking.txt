How long until the cravings go away?

I quit smoking around 6 months ago and began Juuling instead, and the headrush was always more intense so I got even more addicted than I had been to cigarettes. I threw my Juul out 3 weeks ago on Christmas Day and I haven’t touched nicotine since, but I still get intense cravings. I enjoyed it more than drinking or smoking weed and I only do those once every week or two but I feel like I’d rather juul. At what point can I expect these cravings to go away?

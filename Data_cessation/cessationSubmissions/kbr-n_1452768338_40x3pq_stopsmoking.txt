Day 4: Update + Thank you

Hi everyone, 

This is my first ever post on reddit. I'm 26 years old and have been smoking for maybe 9 years. Over the last 2 years my daily intake began to average 15 or so a day, and I'd started feeling really shitty physically. I'd been telling myself that I'd quite tomorrow on a daily basis, but a few days back I decided to push my luck, and I feel pretty good.

I've basically cold turkey-ed it. I'm drinking lots of water, tea and coffee through the day, and snacking considerably at my desk at work. When I get cravings, I either drink water, go for a walk around my office block, look at the Quit Smoking App, or browse this sub for a few minutes. I've also been listen to the Headspace meditation app in the mornings. Day 2 was the worst for me - lots of cravings, dizziness, cough, etc. I actually left work early and came home to lie down. Also, I've taken 2-3 drags of a friend's joint at night the last 2 days (it had tobacco in it) - but I'm thinking of putting an end to that too. 

All in all, the last few days have been both easy and difficult. I wanted to list out some of the positives for anyone else who might be in a similar situation:
- Being able to take deeper breaths
- Feeling slightly more relaxed 
- Looking up from my desk at 7:30 PM and realizing I'm not exhausted nor do I have a headache
- Food tastes AMAZING
- Don't have a shitty taste in my mouth
- Sleep quality has improved dramatically, as has the way I feel when I wake up
- Starting to feel more energetic (this is what normal people must feel like!). I've reached a point where I am looking forward to exercising tomorrow to use my excess energy

This time I actually feel like I will see it through all the way - my self-perception as a smoker had really started to get to me over the last year or two. I've found this sub to be a godsend too, SUPER helpful. It's great to be able to see stories from people at so many different points in this journey - definitely lays out the path ahead. So I just wanted to thank all of you, and wish you good luck!

Hope to share another update at some point.

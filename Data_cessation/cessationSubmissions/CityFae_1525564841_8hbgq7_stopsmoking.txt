I'm gonna quit. i have mixed feelings but it's been time for a while.

I have maybe one other time made a proper attempt to quit, but that one just kind of happened. 

Any advice for getting over the first few days? I've been like 10-15 smokes a day for about 5 years now. I also struggle with drinking and food. So I've got that addictive personality helping me along /s

Haven't bought a pack since last august.

I've been on reddit for quite a while but I never figured that I could come here and get support from you guys.

The title says it well, I haven't bought a pack since last august but still sometimes I will smoke one or two cigarettes when I'm out drinking. 
It pisses me off because I've lost weight(12kg so far), been on a healthy diet, I can do HIIT cardio and I go to the gym 4 times a week. Smoking even one cigarette rarely just doesn't fit my lifestyle anymore. I feel so much better now but the day after smoking even ONE I feel like I've violated my lungs.

I just came here to say that this is day one for me quitting FOR REAL.

If you read this, thank you and let me get aboard the quit-train.

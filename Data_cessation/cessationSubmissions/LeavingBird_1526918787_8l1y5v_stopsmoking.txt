1 week, tearing up

Hi! So, after having quit last year for a time (and slowly getting myself sucked back in through cigarillos), I've made another attempt and have been cigarette-free for a week. I used the Carr book again, worked like a charm, I don't really have cravings and no intent to go back. Yet, I feel this so-called quitter's flu. I'm tired, coughing up, which is okay, but wow. I am quasi-permanently on the verge of crying or I'm crying. I mean I am lovesick and I'm stressed as I have to write a few papers, but wow... 
I don't know where I'm going with this, just looking for some compassion/understanding I suppose.

March 24 would have been a two year milestone for me. I can't recall when it was that I decided to start again, but here's to stopping again.

I just passed day 4. To be clear, this wasn't one of those new year's resolutions. I worked over the new year and it didn't feel like anything much different than a normal work week (work 12's at a hospital), so I passed the entire holiday season from Christmas Eve until today on a ward. That can pretty much dictate the terms of your life while you are there so you really have no time to worry about normal holiday celebrations etc., nor, for that matter, having a cigarette. So I stopped. I stopped just like last time. What I find was important in whatever success I had last time was to not drink at all for some time, not to be around people that constantly stress out about finding a cigarette and to get into running again. It takes at least two weeks of clearing a respiratory infection after quitting before you can even think about running
, so you might as well hit the reset button every time you smoke. So I'll have to reset the badge and hope I can outdo myself this time. Good luck to everyone trying to get over the big mountain of bullshit. Cheers.

My Journey

54 days ago I told myself that if my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer that I would quit smoking for him. My grandfather raised me and was the only father figure I ever had that supported me, regardless of how emotionally broken I was. He saved me from a bad situation that easily could have made me kill myself. He raised me even as I fell apart. 53 days ago, the diagnosis came in. 17 days ago, he passed away from liver cancer that metastasized. 

When I was younger, my grandpa and I promised each other that we would quit together. My grandma has COPD and her smoking was making her worse. He wanted her to be around for as long as she could be. When the time came, though, I didn't even try. He and grandma, however, successfully quit using vapes. They were smoke free for a little over a year. 

My grandpa was given 3 to 6 months to live. I learned, however, that life has no expiration date and it ends when the person is done fighting. I'm glad I quit when I did. One of the last things I'd been able to tell him was, "I didn't want to jump the gun and tell you too soon, but I'm 30 days smoke free." You should have seen the joy that lit up in his face. He told me, "Good. If I had quit at 22, I would have never started. I'm proud of you." 

Cigarettes aren't worth it. Everyone has their own reasons to quit smoking, you just need to find yours and stick by it. It's not about quitting smoking, it's about being smoke free. You're holding yourself hostage and paying for your prison and it's time to let it go. 

And lastly, cherish the time you have. There's never enough of it.

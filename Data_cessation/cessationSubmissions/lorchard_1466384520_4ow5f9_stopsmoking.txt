I've quit using an isolation/sensory deprivation tank

When I got in my car after I was done floating, I had cigs in my passenger seat. I just looked at them and had no urge to smoke. I've had times where I get the craving but it really put my mindset into a 'that is disgusting, I'm literally filling myself up with smoke'.

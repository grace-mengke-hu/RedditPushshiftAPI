Should I start smoking or vaping to help with weight loss?

I need a appetite suppressant and have been looking into smoking for the last 2 weeks. I know its expensive but having 2/3 a day instead of a chocolate bar seems ok right? 

How has smoking affected your diet? Is vaping a good alternative?

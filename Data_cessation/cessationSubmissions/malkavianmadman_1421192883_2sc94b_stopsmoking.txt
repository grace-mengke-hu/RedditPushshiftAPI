Eight days. And I fell fucking GREAT

Hey everyone, I just wanted to say thanks, because I have been smoke free for 8 days (I know my badge says 7 but I'm in NZ) and I think part of the reason it has been so easy for me this time is reading what people say here. 

Now I haven't posted all that much but it has been really positive when I have. But it is also helpful just reading other peoples posts and seeing I am not alone with this struggle, because honestly it can feel like that sometimes.

So yeah keep strong everyone, we can do this, we can get this stinking flea ridden monkey off our backs for good.

EDIT: So apparently while I feel great my brain is still having trouble. Just realised the spelling error in my title.

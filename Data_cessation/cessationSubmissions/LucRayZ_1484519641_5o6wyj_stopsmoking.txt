I'm going to stop smoking, need some advice.

Hi everyone, I think I can start my journey in stop smoking. I waited for the right moment, the ending of my green Golden Virginia pack.
I feel like I need to close a circle, I started with Golden Virginia and I want to end with it.
Now, I need some advice, 'cause I think tomorrow will be the hardest day for me.
I have to be honest, I like to smoke. I smoke while waiting for the bus, sometimes while I drive and when I'm with my friends.
I don't think I need to smoke... I mean: smokers need to light a cigarette every hour or less, right? I can stay also 8-9 hours without smoking, I always followed one rule: no smoking at home.
However, I wanted to say all these things to let you know me a little as smoker, all that I ask is some advice: I already know that smoking is bad for health and money, I need other ideas, something else that can convince me that I can do it, that I have to quit.
Is up to you guys, please help me with something.
Sorry for my english, is not this good... and thank you for all your suggestions.

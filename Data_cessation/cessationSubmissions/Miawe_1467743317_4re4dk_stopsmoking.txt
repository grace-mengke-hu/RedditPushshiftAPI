I haven't been reading this sub much lately...

...which I suppose is a good thing. July 1st marked 9 months without smoking, and it's going well! I got a few small cravings lately, but nothing too hard to resist. I did gain 20-30 pounds since I've stopped, but I am already eating much better and will be focusing on exercising a bit more. 

And overall, I am very happy about where I am now. Woo! Y'all can do this too!

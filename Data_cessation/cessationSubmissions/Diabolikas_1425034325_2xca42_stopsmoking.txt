First week of the rest of my life.

Hey non-smokers, what started out as a joke attempt at quitting, turned into the best week of the last 5 years. Joined in with my sister last week, not thinking to much of it, gave in after 8 hours.

But it got me thinking, i found this sub and read the allen carr easyway. It was an eye-opener! Now im seven days in and never looking back! Some days are harder then others, but its definitly going great. Looking forward to week two, lets not smoke today :)

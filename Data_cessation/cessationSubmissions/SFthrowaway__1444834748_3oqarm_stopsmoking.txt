I have a smoking fetish, but I want to give up cigarettes.

I've been a 10 a day smoker for 4 years (22-26) I've always had a smoking fetish (seeing attractive members of the opposite sex smoking is a turn on for me) I do a lot of sport and the smoking is starting to effect my performance. Not really sure what to do. Feel powerless against smoking every time I see someone attractive light up. I'm not sure if I can give up without breaking the attraction. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

11 days...and very tired

I've been dealing well with my triggers to smoking, and have stayed solid. However, each afternoon I feel extreme fatigue, and end up dozing off no matter what I'm doing. I tend to make my way to bed and sleep for a few hours. I want to say it's because my body needs the sleep to heal, but taking naps has always contributed to my depressive symptoms (I used to sleep all day, through my classes, etc.). But, I still feel as though I am approaching happiness and I am proud of my resilience. This is my 192728187th time quitting, but I'm standing my ground this time.

also my flair is probably wrong still, but again I am on mobile

edit: I'm still coughing shit up and my mouth is plagued with canker sores, but that is all but a reminder.

I realised why I'm gonna make it this time.

This time I have support. Not just from you guys and girls, wich is also realy helpfull, but from my colleagues. 


I have stopped many times before but I never made it thru the first week. My first puf after quitting was always at work. Now I realise it was becouse my co-workers gave me excuses to start again by saying they don't beleve in me or keep offering me cigs even tho I told them I quit.


But things have changed..


Two months ago I got transferred to another city and got to work with a new team of colleagues. Two weaks ago I decided to quit again. I was hesitant to tell my colleagues that I didn't smoke anymore becouse I was afraid they would give me a hard time. The opposite happend. Ofcourse my co-workers found out I had quit very soon becouse I would avoid joining them on smoke-breaks etc. But instead of giving me a hard time about it they gave me their full support. They keep checking in with me to see how I'm doing and give me tips. This go's for both my smoking as my non-smoking colleagues. 


I wish everyone of you the same support of you're surrouding as I am getting!!!!!

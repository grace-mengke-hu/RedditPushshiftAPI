Yikes! nicotine gum

Not sure where to post, please redirect me as needed. I quit smokes ~10 years ago using nic gum, and I'm far past actual cig cravings (thank ye gods). Now, the gum is a problem - I love the stuff, and find myself absent-mindedly gobbling it at any given moment. It's worse than smoking, really, b/c with cigs I had to go outside, work around my daily work schedule, etc.  My lungs are happier, but I want freedom from the constant bombardment of nic in my system. It's like chewing my nails, a habit I don't even notice I'm doing until too late and my cravings are set for the day (both icky oral habits, too, ugh). 

Anyway I'm annoyed with myself, and want to clean my health up further (I just had a b'day, so this is my "new year"). Vaping sucks, I've tried patches, but don't like them (way too strong). Both are just replacements, anyway.  Tapering isn't gonna happen this week, or over the coming month,  given lifestuff (I know I'll only half-ass it, and fall back in). But I think I want to do it soon.  Anyone here quit the gum, and if so, advice?

First morning cravings (psychological)

Hi guys, 
That's it I'm doing it. Just put to patches on (again). (Was advised by my doc to use 2 as I smoke around 30 cigs a day is this safe???).  This is my 4th attempt this week. The evenings are not so hard but when I wake up in the AM the psychological effects kick in and my brain goes into meltdown and can't think about anything but smoking. 
Any morning tips for those who usually smoke first thing? 
Thanks!

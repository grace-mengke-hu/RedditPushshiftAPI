Just requested badge reset. Starting over today, for the last time.

as i write this, i'm looking at that 736-day badge, and cringing. i started smoking again quite shortly after my last (only?) post on here ~2 years ago, and stayed as far from here as i could, to quell the guilt i knew i would feel.

however, this time is different. i finally found my strength and inspiration: my unborn nephew, Aiden, who is due in August. i realized today that signs have been pointing at this for a while now, but i just hadn't been paying attention. my health has been in an increasingly fast nosedive over the last year, and i'm at the point where i absolutely refuse to take anymore chances with my body now that i have a nephew to look forward to, and to have as my reason for striving and reaching forward.

i know for a fact that i can actually follow through this time. because i have to. there's no choice in the matter, this time. i plan on being around for a long time to come, to be there for Aiden. before, all i had to look forward to was more anxiety and depression. but just the thought of seeing his face for the first time is causing me to slow my breathing down to normal rates, and quell the constant hum of anxiety and stress and noise and pain and discomfort that i feel 24/7.

i know this is long, and probably sounds kind of strange and disjointed, but i guess i just had to get it out and tell someone, since i'm not going to make a big deal out of this with my family just yet. building hype within my family will just cause me to feel more pressure, serving only to make things harder for me.

anyway, i'm back (well, mostly, since i don't come to reddit too much these days).

**tl;dr - my as-yet-unborn nephew, Aiden, just saved my life by being my reason for quitting again, for the last time.**

i really thought it'd be easy after a month....

and then 1 terrible day on friday and i bought a pack. i smoked 1. guess what it didn't help the terrible day. i didn't smoke another on friday, and i didn't smoke on saturday.

but then, surprise, on sunday, my friend was chain smoking and i had 2 with her. i felt weakened.

its monday and zero. today it is incredibly hard not to have one, honestly. im slowly sipping a vodka cocktail, waiting for bed, making myself purposefully anxious about relationship-stuff. seeking out a reason to smoke, but not going to do it.

i should throw out the pack. its tempting me, over there in the drawer. its making these pangs feel so real. 

thanks to allen carr i know that the cigarette does nothing. it doesn't relieve my stress, it doesn't fix my problems, it does absolutely nothing. but yet i fixate on it, its something to fixate on. obsess over. 

it does nothing. it is nothing, so why do it?

38 days and 3 slip-ups. do i start over? i don't really want to. i want to keep going, keep the counter going. 38 days i've been fighting. 38 days i've chosen me.

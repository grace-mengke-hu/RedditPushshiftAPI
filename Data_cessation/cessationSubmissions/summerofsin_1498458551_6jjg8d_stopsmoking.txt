So, I quit smoking today. 

I figure I've smoked since I was about fourteen, and I'll be twenty-eight in July. 

I gotta quit. 

I don't know if I'm ready for this though. It was something I'd been thinking about for a little while, and I really need to save money, but I'm kinda scared, and I don't know if I'm ready. 

Am I gonna get fatter? Because that could be a problem. 

I quit drinking 04.04.16, and well, yeah I'm an alcoholic, but that was my new date after my umpteenth relapse, so quitting drinking this time around was not much of a struggle. I've NEVER tried to quit smoking. The longest I've gone without a cigarette EVER was eleven days. 

I already feel like smoking. ðŸ˜µðŸ˜µðŸ˜µ

Yesterday I went for a run for the first time in over a year

I smoked heavily for 20 years and took up  running on my last quit, eventually running half marathons. Stupidly went back to smoking after I had to stop running to recover from an injury. 

Yesterday after two weeks off cigarettes I decided to lace up the trainers again, fully expecting to hardly be able to breathe and find it really difficult. It was the opposite with no nasty carbon monoxide coursing through my veins to make me breathless and I'm amazed I didn't need to walk/run as I'd planned.

Felt sooo good to be getting back to exercise. No way am I jeopardising this by picking up a cigarette again.

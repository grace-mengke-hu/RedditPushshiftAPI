A friendly reminder to those who are long quit...

Don't get overconfident! I quit January 4th 2013 and while I haven't smoked, I've been getting intense cravings, almost as bad as when I first quit, these last few days. My girlfriend who quit two months after I did recently started smoking again (she made the mistake of continuing to smoke with friends and while drunk) and I quit drinking two days ago. I'm 21 and became an alcoholic and I decided enough was enough. Last night I had a damn intense drinking/smoking dream where I smoked a whole pack to myself. It's been tough but I'm pulling through with plenty of hardcore punk and car work to keep me busy. Just because you quit long ago doesn't mean the cravings won't come back!!! Stay strong.

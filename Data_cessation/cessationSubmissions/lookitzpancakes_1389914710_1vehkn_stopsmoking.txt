Why is it HARDER after a month??

Hey guys, it's been over a month since I've quit. Quite happily, in fact. Told myself I'd quit when I turned 25, and after seven years of smoking it was surprisingly easy. I used the beauty of Allen Carr's book coupled with some dedication, and I had no problems.

But, a month on, my cravings are more frequent and more potent than they ever were in the beginning. It also doesn't help that I live in NYC...but wtf? Is there anyone who's experienced this? Obvious question, I'm sure, but I just need some help.

How do I counter this?

**EDIT**: Thank you guys so much for the responses - I just read them this morning. It helps quite a bit. I still can't help thinking, as /u/SuperNashwan said, that I've had something *good* taken away from me...which I know is completely demented. Ugh. I know I can't go back but I'd give anything to just go through the ritual of smoking again. It's so pleasurable to me. Contemplative, peaceful...a forced break from the monotony of the day's activities. I know I could just do that without a cigarette. Maybe I will. Maybe I'll just take a little break outside.

I only hope I won't have to be a prisoner to this kind of longing for the rest of my life. Is it really always like this??

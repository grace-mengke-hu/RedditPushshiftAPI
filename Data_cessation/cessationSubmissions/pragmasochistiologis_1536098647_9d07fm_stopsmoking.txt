Just kind of curious.. maybe we can learn from your mistake:)

For fun, here's what I've written to myself and read every morning:

&amp;#x200B;

  

&amp;#x200B;

BE a non-smoker

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Freedom. Longer life. Decreased Anxiety. I want to stop craving and revolving around cigarettes. Feel better, look better, more energy, more money, less self conscious

&amp;#x200B;

Pseudo-benefit list – it’s not relaxing, social, engaging; It’s fed addiction tied to different types of events. It did not make those events; it simply took away from events where the addiction was not fed, preventing presence.

&amp;#x200B;

Your day will have some discomfort – that’s what you signed up for but it will get easier till it goes away. The cons are temp.

&amp;#x200B;

The fun stuff – Transfer cigarette/beer money into savings daily. Do daily mission

&amp;#x200B;

Treat yourself well – eat what you want. Buy what you want. Do what you want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Be Productive Everyday. Give yourself something to look forward to the next day, even if small, like having clothes ironed in advance, a clean sink, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Meet your needs. If you need to get up and go for a walk, do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical Activity – do the opposite of smoking by doing healthy things such as working out, biking, working on the house/yard, etc

&amp;#x200B;

Do other bad stuff if you want or improve it too - You still have other bad habits you can be self destructive with. Go nuts. Or if you’re motivated, improve it! No pressure either way.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW IS PERFECT; IT WILL NEVER BE EASIER – 

&amp;#x200B;

No Relationships – for now, stay away from relationshippy type of dynamics. Hitting on girls, casual action, fine, but stay independent &amp; un-invested.

&amp;#x200B;

Find Inspiration Daily – whether it be about not smoking, killing bad habits and building good ones, listen to something every fucking day.

&amp;#x200B;

Revisit Allen Carr’s logic daily – This will help at points when you think about how a cigarette might taste good, relax you, etc. Be reminded that smoking offers nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Find a hobby/passion and invest daily – reading, some art form, learn new stuff on guitar, whatever.

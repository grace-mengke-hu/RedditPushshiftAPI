I need to stop before it's not too late

I've been smoking for 5 months so I probably don't know shit about being addicted, but I want to quit before it's not too late. I started in December, firstly it was just occasional smoking, going to the school bathroom with friends and smoking one or two cigarettes. Then I started buying my own packs and smoking more often. I noticed recently that I'm starting feeling the need to smoke inside me, especially at the morning and it worried me. I smoked my last pack in 3 days and that's really much for me. I decided to quit as my addiction isn't too strong yet. It's really hard for me to refuse when friends offer me one and that's my biggest problem. I'd like to hear your advices how to stay assertive. Sorry for my english and good luck with quiting!

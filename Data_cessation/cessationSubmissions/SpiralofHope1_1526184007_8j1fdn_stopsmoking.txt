One week free from chops/mookes

Weed + tobacco through bong = chop

Terrible for you. Truly. I made a post a week ago, it was super short, basically me saying this is stupid and I'm quitting. I did it. I have no desire to smoke a chop or a cig. I'm not really sure how but its just gone now. Me being sick and coughing up brown and black gunk probably helped too.

But wow, I'm free. It feels so good. I have so much of my mind back it feels like. I'm able to think about other things instead of when my next toke is gonna be, and I'm also able to get high off of weed again, which is amazing. It's that nice giggly, smiley high, not the chops big head rush, heavy high. Quitting smoking chops, nice graduation present for myself. 

  
Thanks guys for the encouraging posts. For real would not have made it without reddit.

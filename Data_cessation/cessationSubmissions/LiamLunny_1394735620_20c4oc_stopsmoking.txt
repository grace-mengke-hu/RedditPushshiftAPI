I quit three days ago but I feel horrible

I haven't had any cravings at all since I quit. No anxiety or withdrawal symptoms. Is it just a coincidence that I have a really bad cough, really sore throat, and fever? I don't know if this is caused by quitting or if I just got a cold the same time i quit.

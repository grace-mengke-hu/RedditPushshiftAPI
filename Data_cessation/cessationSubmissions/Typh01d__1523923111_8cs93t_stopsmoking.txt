Does anyone hate vapes just as much as smoke now?

After you get into your quit a bit, you start to smell tobacco smoke again and it's horrid. Smokers smell so bad that I have to give them a wide birth. But I've noticed that vape will give me an *instant* headache. Even just a whiff from someone 20 feet away. 10/10 times I'd rather walk through a group of smokers than be anywhere near a vape.

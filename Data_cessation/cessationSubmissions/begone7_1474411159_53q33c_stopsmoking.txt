4th attempt

Been trying this whole month to break this habit after moving to a new city, feeling isolated keeps giving me cravings and I just throw the whole pack after two cigarettes, truely hating the loss of money and the stick on my fingers. Gonna try again for fourth time this month, wish me luck, gonna put the next Â£3 into a savings account and slowly build a piggy bank of savings to help me try and quit. Never expected it to be so hard, tbh never expected to be a smoker but life does run away from you sometimes

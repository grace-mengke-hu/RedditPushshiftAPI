66 days! still no desire to smoke!

And I have had a few emotional things hit me the past few weeks, found out my mom has breast cancer, dealing with a crazy situation with my former best friend, my father inlaw is dying from lung cancer and this is typically the time of year that my anxiety and depression really hit me hard (SAD) and I still have not lit up. 

I really had to think to myself will smoking really help me at all through all this? The answer is NO, no it wont help, it will only make things worse!

Keep on keepin' on guys!

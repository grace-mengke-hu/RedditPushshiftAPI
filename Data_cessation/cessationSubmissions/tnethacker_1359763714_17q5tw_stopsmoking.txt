Depression and 30 days off smokes

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to ask if anyone else got depressed when they stopped smoking, as i was for 15 years. 

I quit smoking january first this year and have been without smokes for the past month, BUT today - i couldn't take it anymore.

The past 4 weeks had been a pain, but nothing unbearable. But 2 weeks ago i went depressed. I tried all means to cope on by but today, after losing a lot of money and work (i'm an entrepreneur), i bought myself a cigar just to get rid of the depression.

I actually hate smoking cigars, but the one i bought (mini-cigar without any nicotine) felt like the heaven opened up to me and i could smile first time in the world.

So my question is, how can i efficiently stay off the cigars/nicotine without being depressed as being depressed this month actually cost me more than a years worth of smokes as i couldn't work...

Currently having what I hope will be my last cigarette.

Tomorrow morning I'm trying the patches and gum combination. I've tried lots of times to quit and never succeeded. The patches and gum are something I've not yet had a crack on so here we go.

Been a smoker since I was 17 and now I'm 40. Enough is enough. Wish me luck ðŸ™‚

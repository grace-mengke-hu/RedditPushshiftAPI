How much could a few puffs from an eCig set back my progress health-wise? Reset quit date?

I've smoked off and on since I was about 15 (I'm now 29) but in recent years, it's been a weekend thing, where I would smoke socially while drinking, sometimes up to a pack a night both nights. I quit entirely this year and have not taken a single puff since. Last night I did hit my husband's eCig 2-3 times. I felt okay with it in the moment because it wasn't a cigarette. This may sound stupid by my question is, would the nicotine I took in have any real negative health effects on my progress so far? I know it takes a few days to get out of your system. Should I reset my quit date?

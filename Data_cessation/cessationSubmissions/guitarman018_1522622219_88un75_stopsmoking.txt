2 weeks in but it's getting harder

Smoked for 12 years, tried quitting more times than I can count. 
 Vaped for a while, but that seemed to make it too easy to pick up smoking again so I've quit that too.

Has been 2 weeks since I've had anything foreign in my lungs, and it is nice being able to smell things again and not being out of breath, but I'd hoped by now it would be getting a bit easier.

I'm afraid to leave the house for fear I'll buy a pack of smokes.  All weekend all I can think about is smoking, the constant craving just isn't letting up and I'm getting REALLY sick of it.

Does anybody have any advice here?  I'm on the verge of cracking and just buying some :(

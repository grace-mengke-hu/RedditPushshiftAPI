21 days smoke free after 30 years

Hi, Iâ€™m still saying WOW Iâ€™m a non smoker, Iâ€™ve done cold turkey and itâ€™s been awful but today I realised that my first thought when I wake up is NOT i need a fag, I can leave the house without making sure I have enough fags and a lighter, I have money in my purse, I donâ€™t smell of stale smoke or just had one smoke and I donâ€™t get wet from standing out in the rain desperately tying to keep my fag dry!! I will never smoke again I know that for sure, Iâ€™ve recently been laid up with a trapped nerve in my back.... very bored days but not even a thought of fags. In the beginning every craving was awful, I just kept in my mind not one puff - and then I would say I will have a fag tomorrow, telling myself this made my cravings go, I donâ€™t really have cravings now or itâ€™s just a fleeting second. Reading all the posts on here helped a lot, so Iâ€™m hoping that mine can help too.  Yes itâ€™s hard, but just remember the fags control you take back the control ðŸ˜Š

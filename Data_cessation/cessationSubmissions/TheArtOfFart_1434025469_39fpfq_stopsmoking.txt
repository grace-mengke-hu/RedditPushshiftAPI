Looking for some advice to quit

So my story: Im a 24 yo male and started regular smoking in the age of 17. I have been active in all kind of sports my whole life, like football, running and basketball. Played football here in Germany on a decent level and had to train up to 5 or 6 times a week. My stamina was pretty good even though i smoked quiet a lot at that time. I always told myself that i would stop smoking as soon as the smoking impairs my ability to play football on that level. Well 3 years ago i broke my foot  and so i was incapable of playing for about 6 months. During that time i still smoked a lot. After my foot recovered i had to regain my stamina. It was hard and cost me a lot of effort. Once i got my fitness back i broke my foot again at the exact same spot. So a surgery and another 6 months went by and i had like no motivation left to get back to sports. Also i had a new job so i didn't want take the risk of another injury. So here I am now almost 3 years without any sports but I'm smoking more than ever. Im currently at the point where I have problems with running stairs. I really want to quit but I actually have no idea how to motivate myself. Im pretty new to reddit but I'm happy I stumbled upon this sub. I don't really know what to expect from publishing my thoughts here but I hope some of you guys could give me some advice on how to plan quitting and eventually how to keep beeing a non smoker.

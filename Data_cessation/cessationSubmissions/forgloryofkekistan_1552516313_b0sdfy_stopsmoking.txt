I saw in person how much tar is going inside me every time i smoke. Could someone help me find information on how to completely recover from all the damage ive done to myself up until now?

I am pretty freaked out after i used a cigarette filter thing which collects all the tar in a transparent little tube thing as you smoke and i saw how much tar was collected after just 5 cigarettes. Ive been smoking for months now at that rate of 5 or more a day and i want to know since ive decided to totally quit today, will all the tar thats gotten inside me clear out or an i screwed for life. Its freaking me out after seeing it in person how much tar is going inside me every time i enjoy a smoke. Can some give info on how long it take to totally recover after quiting?

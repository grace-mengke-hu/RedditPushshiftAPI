After 3 weeks quitting. Starting to cough up phlegm

Ugh.  So now have this cough and hacking up phlegm that is a bit grey.   I read this is from the lungs healing itself and the cilia trying to move the toxins and gunk out of the system.

How long does this phlegm last?  NEver had coughing during smoking, and now i'm coughing all the time with phlegm.

Any others with similar experience?

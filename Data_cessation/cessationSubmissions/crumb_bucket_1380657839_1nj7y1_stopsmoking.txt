First day! Quitting so I can get weight-loss surgery.

So, I've tried quitting LOTS of times before. I've used the patch, the lozenge, done cold turkey, Allen Carr's Easyway. Nothing stuck. This time, I have been taking Wellbutrin for 6 weeks, and have been able to cut down a lot. Today is my first day smoke-free and I'm PUMPED! In December I'm getting weight-loss surgery and quitting is a requirement. Can't wait to be healthier in so many ways. Can't WAIT to be able to ride bikes with my son without getting winded from smoking and my weight. I'm really excited and wanted to say so, and also to wish the best to everyone else here who is on their own journey! YOU CAN DO IT AND SO CAN I! :)

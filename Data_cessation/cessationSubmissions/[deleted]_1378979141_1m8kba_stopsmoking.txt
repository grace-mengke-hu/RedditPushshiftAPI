Had a dream that I smoked!

I'm getting close to 100 days and haven't had any real urges or cravings since the first month. Last night I had a vivid dream. A friend asked me to hold her cigarette for a minute, and I reflexively took a drag. That led to smoking a whole cigarette. In the dream, I was mad at myself, and I even felt a sore throat! 

Thankfully I woke up this morning smoke free. It was so realistic, though, that I almost fooled my waking brain into thinking I'd relapsed!

Caved after 63 days.

Going through a bit of what I guess you could call an existential crisis.  The reality of things hit me: I'm just not ready to completely quit cigarettes so I quit quitting.  I miss smoking with my friends and it makes me happy.  Why should I deprive myself of one or two nostalgia cigarettes once in a while? 

Good luck to all those who are still on the wagon and wish to remain there.

Having a weak moment...

I'm about four hours from completing day nine and I'm suddenly having some pretty horrendous cravings for some reason. Any words of encouragement from you beautiful people would be amazingly appreciated as I'm right on the brink at the moment. I will grit my teeth and suffer through it but just wanted to make a post to try and hold myself accountable...

no more addiction

hello reddit. about a month ago i made a decision to say a big "fuck you"to my smoking addiction. smoked for close to 9 years. got to a pack a day even more. haven't had a day in witch i didn't smoke. 
wanted to make my father a model for me in this. wanted to not feel weak if i wanted to smoke. i still love to do it. i still love smoking. but now i don't need it anymore. i am stronger than this.

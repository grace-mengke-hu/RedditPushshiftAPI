Ways to deal with stress after quitting?

I've been a smoker for about 4 years now, about half a pack a day. I've been trying to quit for 2 years now, and I keep getting through the first few weeks; but then a stressful situation occurs and I go right back to smoking. I have taught myself to deal with stress and anxiety with smoking, but I don't know how to unlearn it or replace it. Please help, I'm willing to do anything to get out of this prison they call addiction.

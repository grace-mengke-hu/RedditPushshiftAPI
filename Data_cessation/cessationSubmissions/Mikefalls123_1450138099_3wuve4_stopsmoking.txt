Hey all 350 Hours here

i just wanted to post and remind you all that you are doing a great thing and dont give up.
Be strong and keep your head up.

Ive been cig free for 2 weeks and Ive never felt better in over 5 years.

Great things take time, so just think about why u are quiting and remember a golden rule: NOT ANOTHER PUFF

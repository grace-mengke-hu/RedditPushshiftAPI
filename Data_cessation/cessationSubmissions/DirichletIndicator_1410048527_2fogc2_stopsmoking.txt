I might be about to start smoking again

I'm in my early 20s, and I really want a cigarette.  

Last year I took up smoking for one semester, while dealing with extreme depression.  Generally 2-6 a week, never more than 4 in one day.  But I started with the intention of never having more than one a week, and that lasted all of one week.  I quit when my grandfather got lung cancer.  

When I quit I started wondering about the possibility of still having a cigarette very occasionally; I eventually, after careful consideration, came to the conclusion that I personally am not able to have a healthy relationship with cigarettes.  I enjoy them too much, if I have one more I won't stop.  

But I just moved to the deep south, and seeing people smoking everywhere I've been craving it more and more.  I think I might actually start up again.  I don't get it, I was so resolute just a month ago, but I'm very seriously thinking about lighting one up.  

I'm hoping there's something someone can say that will snap me out of this.  There are so many reasons not to do it; they just don't seem to be helping.  

I'd appreciate any reply.  All the things I'd done to keep from smoking again are failing me, I don't know where to turn.

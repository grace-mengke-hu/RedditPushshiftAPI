When to quit?

Currently still taking the chantix but it really messes up my stomach. This time quitting has gotten farther with the help of the chantix than any other quit attempt in almost 30yrs of smoking so I'll keep taking it for now. My question to anyone who's also used it is when did you stop taking the pills? 30 days? 60? 90?

16 years of smoking. I'll be 30 in 5 months. I've had enough.

I started smoking when I was 13, heavily (about a pack a day, more at times). For the past five years, my lifestyle hasn't really permitted me to smoke more than a few packs per week. I do, however, tend to indulge when I drink. Even though I've cut back on my smoking habit significantly, it terrifies me to think that I've been a heavy smoker my entire adolescent and adult life. 

Today I read an article about people who died of smoking related lung cancer in their thirties. I can't justify this habit anymore. I can't justify the one smoke on my lunch break and the other after work. I can't justify the night on a patio drinking a beer and smoking 7 cigarettes because "I deserve to unwind after a long day". I deserve to be alive to enjoy all of the real things in my life, the things I've worked hard for that make me truly happy. I'm walking away from it today, towards (hopefully) many years of health and happiness.

Wish me luck when I go to a wedding on Saturday. That'll be the real test of my will.

Anyone have completely different quitting experiences if they have tried to quit multiple times?

I feel like this time quitting is so much different than the last time I tried to quit in May. The last time I was quitting I felt tired all the time, I didn't have too many cravings, and after a couple of weeks I started to get bad anxiety which is what eventually made me cave in and start smoking again. 

However, this time I can't sleep (even with a natural sleep aid), I'm having cravings that are much worse, more anger issues, but no anxiety. Has anyone else had something like this happen?

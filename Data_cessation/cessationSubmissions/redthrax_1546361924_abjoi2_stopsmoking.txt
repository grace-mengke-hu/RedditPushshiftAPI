Im starting the New Year with withdrawls, but no Nicotine

Ive been smoking heavy for five years, using a vape for the past several with more nicotine than before. On the 28th I.... I dont know why but I just randomly decided to quit. I ran out of juice and was starting to freak out about having to wait until the next day to get more and suddenly I just decided to stop. I took that momentum and threw my vape, my spare, all of my juice, and my batteries away in the trash. My theory as that cigarettes are easy to breakdown and buy, but ive been off of them for years and the vape would cost me like two hundred bucks just to have that one relapse puff. Hopefully not being able to relapse will help me.

Now im beginning 2019 with my fourth day cold turkey. I dont know if ive felt worse physically ever before in my life and the mental torment is nearly unbearable but.... Im glad im not starting the New Year with a puff. I feel like if I tell more people then I wont be able to just go back and pretend I never did this.

Happy 2019 folks.

Day 24: Lack of concentration and motivation is a big problem

I expected these kinds of troubles the first week I quit and I expected that things would linger, but I really was not planning on being basically non-functional for weeks. I'm a programmer, and I'm freelancing. Being self-employed has some upsides when it comes to quitting smoking, but freelancing requires self-motivation and programming requires concentration.

I've noticed improvement in the motivation department. I assume my brain has been in a dopamine drought and now is starting to finally self-regulate better. (I was constipated for the first two weeks and things started smoothing out around the same time my motivation started improving funnily enough.) The lack of concentration and brain fog, however, isn't making the kind of progress that I need it to be making.  It's better than the first week for sure, but I feel like I'm 50%? Less? Like, I need to be getting back to 100 asap cause I need to hustle and may have some new things starting up.

I've searched in stopsmoking for other people that have had concentration problems that have lasted a while and found that other people have had these problems, which is comforting to know I'm not alone, but it's also just so frustrating to not know when I'm going to start feeling better. It's worrisome. I have things to do. If I can get myself to do something, then I can't concentrate properly to do it. 

Edit: Also language issues...I feel like I've been making more mistakes, weird word slips or wrong tenses. I've always done kind of weird things like that before but it's just pretty amplified right now. I feel so hazy.

Advice? 

Edit 2: I would also like to note that I've been pretty healthy since I quit smoking: making good meals, drinking LOTS of water, and running about every other day for the past 10 days. (So far in August, I have run 6 times and drank 45 liters of water.)


Gah. Fuck you cigarettes.

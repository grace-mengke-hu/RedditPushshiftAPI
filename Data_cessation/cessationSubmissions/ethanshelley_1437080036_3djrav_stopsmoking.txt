Day 6 - Cant shake the e-cig!

My first week has gone well so far, a few cravings here and there but they passed easy enough. I'm now using an e-cig which i know is a cleaner and healthier alternative, but i'm getting to a point of thinking fuelling the nicotine addiction (and spending money on refills) is just too counter productive!! My biggest problem is that the ones I'm using taste so damn good (especially the cherry flavour!). The taste is as addictive as the nicotine now. Would you guys recommend quitting the e-cig completely and braving the storm? Or maybe getting re-fills with lower levels of nicotine?

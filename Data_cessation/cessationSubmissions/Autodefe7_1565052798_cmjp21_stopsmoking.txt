Trying to quit - need help with work stress

I am 7 days without a smoke.  I am using patches and have the gum (haven't used it yet).  I was just on holidays for a week so that was easier as I didn't have to be at work.

Now, I use smoking at work to deal with stress.  My job really stresses me out - and I was wondering if anyone had any tips for how to deal with the stress other than smoking?  I have the gum, I have candy suckers for the habit, and I have a 4 step process from a help group I joined (drink water, deep breath, delay the smoke, distract yourself).

What did you successful people do to help combat using smoking to deal with stress.

Thanks  - and good luck!

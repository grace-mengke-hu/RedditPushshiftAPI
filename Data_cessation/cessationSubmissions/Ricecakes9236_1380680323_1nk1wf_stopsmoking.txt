Flatmates all smoke inside! HELP

Hey guys, I have been smoking for 5 years now. Recently my chest has been hurting a lot and my heart is pounding after one flight of stairs, so I decided its time to quit, but every time I tell myself  I'm done I break (a couple of hours/days in) because my flatmates smoke. I will be sitting there fine and then I will hear the spark of a lighter followed by the initial smell of flint/cig smoke and I cant help myself. I feel like a shark who caught the sent of blood or something. Any advice you guys could give me would be much appreciated.

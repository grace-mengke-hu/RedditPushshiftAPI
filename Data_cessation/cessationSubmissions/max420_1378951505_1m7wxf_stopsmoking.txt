I quit using the Easy Way! It really works!

I quit using Allan Carr's Easy Way method, and hot damn, does it ever work.

I'm on day 6, and haven't had a craving since day 2, and they were very mild.  I'm proud to say I'm a non smoker again.

I quit using Easy Way a year ago, and at the time it was also just as easy, but in a stupid drunken moment earlier this year had a cigarette.  Sure enough after a few months of sneaking one here and there I was buying packs and smoking regularly again.   

So I listened to my copy of the audio book again, and this time I'm through! No more stupid drunken moments - no more smoking tobacco  ever again! Never, ever, ever, ever!

NOPE = Not One Puff Ever

I had a super intense craving tonight. I had drinks with a friend, came home to an empty house and my brothers cigarettes were on the table. My addicted mind tried to trick me:  

"No one is home. No one will ever know."  

I loaded up reddit and searched posts about cheating and this acronym really helped.  Thought I would share.

Thanks /u/supertallcraig.

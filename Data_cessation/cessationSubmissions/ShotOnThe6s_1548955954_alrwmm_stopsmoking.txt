My Time To Quit.

Hello 👋 I’m new here, so hello everybody, I’m Shane, age 15, smoker of about 4 years. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but I wanted to share my story.

So it started off when I was 11, I was always getting into trouble at the time. One night I ended up finding my dads cigarettes, and me being the trouble making 11 year old I was, I took a few.

I took them in my room and smoked them (he has a bad sense of smell so my thought was he wouldn’t figure me out) &amp; the first one I smoked made me feel sick but I tried again.

I enjoyed it, &amp; I smoked for the rest of the night. Next day I didn’t have cravings but I just wanted to smoke more to be “cool” as my 11 year old self thought at the time.

Then day 3 came.

I went to school, to which after a few hours I started going crazy cause I wanted a cigarette so bad, &amp; that’s when I knew I f*cked up.

Fast forward to 14, &amp; still smoking, I decided to try and quit. I managed to.

For 1 day.

The next day was too hard for me, I gave in and smoked, &amp; the cravings were so bad I smoked 4 in the first hour. Ever since then I’ve been smoking way more than I did for the first 3 years. I smoked every hour and a half or so up up until that happened, resulting in me smoking every half an hour.

My dad ended up figuring out recently, &amp; now he’s going to try and help me quit. I’ve been wanting to quit myself but I’ve just been scared of getting more addicted. My journey shall start tomorrow at 12 AM EST, Feb 1, 2019.

I really hope this sub helps me, &amp; I appreciate any support you guys give me. If you’ve made it to the end, thank you for taking time out of your day to read it, it means a lot to me.

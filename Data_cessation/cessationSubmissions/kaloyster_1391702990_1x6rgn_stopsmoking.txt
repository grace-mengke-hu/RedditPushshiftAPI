I really want to quit but I don't know how and I'm afraid if I can

Smoking as I type this.

I also have that app Quit Pro and set it to gradually reduce to 6 (smoking 14+ before) but I cannot stick to it. Always ending up around 8 or 9.

How are the cravings and how long do they last? I also want to my mom & dad to quit or atleast convince them to quit with me.

:(

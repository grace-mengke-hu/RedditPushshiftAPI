21 yo, 4 days into the 2nd serious attempt at quitting.

Ill start with a bit of background. I've been a Smoker for the last 4 years, not so heavy, maybe 5-8 rollies a day on average. This is the "second" (there's been many kind of proxy attempts at quitting where i knew in my heart i was doomed to fail) time i'm going for the all out total quit. I recently had a 6 month period of smoking e-ciggs which were great, no cough, no smell, not as expensive, but still weren't perfect in terms of lung performance when playing sports. So thats my story, and here comes my question....

Im currently on day 4 of the cold turkey quit. Where so far the furthest i've ever travelled along this road in the last four years is to day 13. I was wondering to those of you who have made it further along the highway of being smoke free, does the craving lessen as you go along? 

At the moment it feels as if the inside of my limbs, almost like the inside of my veins, are aching for a hit of nicotine which gets to a weird vibration kind of feeling if i have any alcohol.

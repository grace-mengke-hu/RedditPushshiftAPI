Seeking a 'sponsor'.

I read a thread suggesting a sponsor, somebody to talk to when the temptation to smoke is too much. Anybody here willing to fill that role? I think it would help me. I have a Reddit app on my phone, so occasional PMs will work for me.

I'm setting my badge. Had my last dose of nicotine. I want to go all out and quit nicotine altogether.

Thanks for reading.

How can schools help their students quit smoking?

Hi r/stopsmoking! I'm a writer for my school newspaper, the Valley Star, and my school recently banned smoking on campus. However, they haven't provided any information to students that would help them quit smoking. It seems more like they're banishing all smokers to the outskirts of the campus (where the designated smoking areas are).

I was wondering if maybe this subreddit would have any suggestions for my school? Do you think that schools that ban smoking have a responsibility to provide information to its students about quitting?

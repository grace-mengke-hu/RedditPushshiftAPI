A question for lady r/stopsmokingers.

One of the big things they tell you about why you should stop smoking is because it'll make your skin better. However, mine has gotten worse. Considerably worse in 9 days. Like, the worst my skin has ever been.

Has anyone else experienced this reaction? And if so, does it improve after a while by itself?

Thanks in advance!

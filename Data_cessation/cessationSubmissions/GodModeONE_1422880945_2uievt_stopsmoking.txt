38 hours in after 10+ years of smoking. Goodbye, you solider of death!

I've tried quitting many times before in the past. Doing it again now, this time for good. I've spent too much money and too many days waking up with coughs and dry lips for this to be a logical decision any more. So goodbye, you tiny soldier of death.

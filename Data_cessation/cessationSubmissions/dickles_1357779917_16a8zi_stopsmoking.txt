Tomorrow is my one month without smoking cigarettes

I grew up around two full-time smokers who never thought twice about lighting up in the car with the windows rolled up. Every other weekend, my brother and I would visit our dad and he would have us change clothes and smell our old clothes. We always knew that we stank like cigarettes, but it didn't bother us - that was just the way life was.

I remember being 15 and sitting in class and having my teacher admonish me for smoking at such a young age. I tried telling her that I didn't, but she gave me this accusing look and said that she could smell it on my homework papers. 

No one was surprised when I finally did pick up smoking soon after that incident. I saw my mom struggle with addiction, through divorce after divorce she always had her best friend nicotine. I still don't understand why I started. I guess to fit in.

Thankfully, nearly 6 years after picking up my first cigarette, I have kicked the habit, for good. It wasn't hard. My addiction was all in my head. Each cigarette getting me further and further away from the person I wanted to be. But I am grateful to have realized it so young, and I am even more grateful that my s.o. has decided to quit after a pack a day for 10 years habit. 

We can finally breathe together, and enjoy social settings without the anxiety of "when will our next cigarette be?" And really, how much longer could we have hid it from his family? As if they didn't know, as if they couldnt smell it on him each time they hugged.

Anyways, I am grateful most of all to Allen Carr, his book changed my life, and to all those wondering about taking the plunge, there will never be a "perfect time" to quit. Best of luck!

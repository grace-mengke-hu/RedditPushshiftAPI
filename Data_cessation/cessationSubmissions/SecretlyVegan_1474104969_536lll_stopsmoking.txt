Quitting and a lot of other things are worth it.

I used to think that eating healthy foods wasn't worth it since I smoked and was ruining my health anyway. Running wasn't really worth the time and effort since I smoked and was ruining my health anyway.

Guess what! They're totally worth it regardless, but even more so now that I don't smoke. Quitting has made me realize that I can do a lot of things to be more healthy and more in shape and I'm doing those, but the best thing is that I feel that they're worth it now and if I can quit and keep on not smoking I can definitely do other things for my health too.

At day 46, I find that I no longer check my app daily. I visit this sub to read about others experiences and to reply if I think I might be able to help. It took me about a month till I no longer had any noticeable cravings and now I don't really even know when was the last time I seriously thought about smoking.

Keep on not smoking!

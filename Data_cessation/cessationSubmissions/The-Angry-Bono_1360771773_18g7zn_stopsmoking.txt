Tomorrow is 3 weeks.

Tomorrow I will reach the 21 day mark since I last had a cigarette. I spent the first week chewing nicotine gum, but stopped for the second week. I made it through my car breaking down, bombing an important midterm, and being laid off work indefinitely with out breaking down for a smoke. 

I'm honestly not sure why I've had success this time, where I failed so many other times, when I didn't experience this type of stress. I guess I've just been lucky. 

I've saved almost $200 and spent the savings on a new tank for my little buddy [Captain Morgan](http://i.imgur.com/qdymIUA.jpg).

Day 0, just threw out my cigs!

Getting rid of ashtrays &amp; lighters when I get home. I’ve only been smoking again for a couple of weeks, so hopefully it’s not too rough. But it’ll be worth it to be able to do cardio again &amp; to smell acceptable to other humans. And, y’know, the whole “don’t wanna get cancer or emphysema” thing.

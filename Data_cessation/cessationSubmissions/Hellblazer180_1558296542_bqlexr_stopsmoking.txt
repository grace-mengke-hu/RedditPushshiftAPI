When will I stop being angry?

Hi guys, 

Today is day 7 for me cold turkey. 20 a day for 10 years. First three days was quite tough in terms of cravings. But the last few days has been a nightmare. I'm not getting as many cravings past day 3, but since then, I'm constantly pissed off to the point of severely impairing relationships. I tried deep breathing exercises, drinking a healthy amount of water, eating regularly and keeping myself distracted when craving. Got the Smoke Free app and I regularly read posts in this sub.

However, whenever someone talks to me, I feel like telling them to STFU and piss off. Any tips or help? All i can think is that I'm not ready to do this and throwing it in. 

I'm ready to cave at this point. I know itll be worth it in the end, but I'm thinking about another attempt at a later point. Obviously, the nicotine is out of my system at this point. I'm sure it's all mental right now.

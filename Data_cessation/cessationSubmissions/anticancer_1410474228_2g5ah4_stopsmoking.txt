Just made 24 hours, y'all! Woosah.....

I know 24 hours is not a long time, but one day feels like a huge deal to me.  I don't believe I would have been able to stop at all let alone make it this far (last time I cracked after 16 hours) without the advice and encouragement I've received here.  This is really a tremendous community, resource, and support system.  Thank you all so much!

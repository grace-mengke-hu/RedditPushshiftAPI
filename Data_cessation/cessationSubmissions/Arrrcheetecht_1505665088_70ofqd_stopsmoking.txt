Big thank you to all on r/stopsmoking!

Almost forgot about smoking...been trough a lot of tempting situations (stress at work, family situations, drunk, with friends who smoke, euphoric moments), never caved. When it was the hardest I came to this safe place and read your stories, commented on some, posted a few times. This community is golden! Will be still comming here to support others and to remind myself how hard were the first weeks.

After a month I notice (even my wife said it a few times) that I'm a lot calmer, almost at peace with myself. The most I can see it when I'm driving...used to curse a lot, almost roadraging at moments. I like this new version of me.

I'm a non smoker now. Thanks!

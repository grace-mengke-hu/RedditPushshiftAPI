Replacing addiction with addiction

I’m on day 9 of quitting. I quit cold turkey with no nicotine replacement. It’s getting easier. I never really drank coffee before but I started drinking coffee when I quit and now I find myself waking up craving coffee. Obviously, it’s a lot healthier to have a caffeine addiction. People don’t die everyday from drinking coffee. But I didn’t want to replace an addiction with another addiction. What do you guys think? What did you guys that quit cold turkey do? Any suggestions?

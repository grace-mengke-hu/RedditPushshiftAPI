5 minutes for a -5 months of your life

At least that's what I used to think. I smoked for a good year, knowing what's gonna happen in the future, bc I saw what it did to my grandparents and their peers. Every time I went out for a cigarette, I used to think "man, only 5 minutes of my life takes away at least 5 months off of mine" then I started exercising that in my mind when I went out for one. It scared me, then I heard a friend of mine was quitting. She was on nicotine patch and I asked if I could have a few. She gave me a whole box knowing someone might ask her. So I started on the patch, it took away cravings but i didn't know what to do with the time i had, so i kept going out for one, once a day. Soon later, i realized i really wanted to quit, so i just stopped myself everytime i tried. It's been seven months, and I'm so happy not going down on the same path my grandparents went. Seven months. Thinking back at it now, i chose to buy cigarettes instead of food we could've had, i guess it got that bad.

I apologize for the negativity, but does this feel pointless to anyone else?

I am on my 23rd day, my second week without the patch.  This is maybe my seventh or eighth attempt at quitting smoking.  The longest I went was from 2015-2016, 11 months and 11 days.  Right after I got a promotion at work, I caved to the stress and went into a weird haze.  All I remember is driving home from work, and then for some reason I stopped and bought a full pack of Marlboro Lights.

Is struggling like this how it's going to be for the rest of my life?  Because if it is, I'd might as well start smoking again.  Each time I quit, I gained a huge amount of weight.  I don't recall ever losing it when I started smoking again.  

Will someone please tell me it gets better.  Tell me I'm not doomed to living my life craving something I can never have again.

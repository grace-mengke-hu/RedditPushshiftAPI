I was at the c-store TWICE today and no real craving... 100% success at avoidance.

despite many brands of cigarettes on the shelves behind the counter AND people smoking in their car and everywhere. I haven't smelled a cigarette yet today and want to NOT smell a cigarette, because that is a possible trigger. What is more, they may possibly smell actually SHITTY now.

I am just seemingly become MORE stubborn than ever about quitting this time and wonder how I am not going downstairs and crying to Marta about getting a smoke or any of that shit. Oddly, the craving on my first day remained minimal to none, mostly the first 5 minutes after I woke up was the worst craving of all, then it went down to a small drop of a craving once in a few hours and the craving isn't severe like I feared last night.

Just a small throb, like a banged elbow and that is it for a craving.

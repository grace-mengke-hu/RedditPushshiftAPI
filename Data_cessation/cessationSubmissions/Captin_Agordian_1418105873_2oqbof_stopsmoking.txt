Relapse after 1yr 9 months smoke free =(

Giving up smoking, even though it had only been 1 yr 9 months smoke free after being a smoker for the last 18 yrs, was one of the things in life I was most proud of myself for. I have gotten very healthy, go to the gym, go for runs and have a young family as great incentive to stay healthy. For the last 2 weeks I have started smoking at work here and there, it started as a social thing as a work colleague was leaving and at first I thought I could control it and I would be ok if I just had one here and there very infrequently when I wanted it. I have found that smokers are always happy to give you a spare cigarette of theirs and were more than happy to have me joining them despite the high cost of smokes these days in Australia. I feel so shitty, I have just come back in from having a smoke after not having one for the last three days (told myself I was done with it again and wouldn’t have anymore) and I feel terrible. No surprises but it didn’t make me feel good or relieve any tension just made me feel like crap and I am consumed with a sense of shame and feel like I have let myself down again. When I had given up I didn’t see work as a place I would or could smoke anymore but I guess in the last 2 weeks I do now. I know what I need to do, I need to go back to fighting the urges like I did when I first gave up and get back into the right mindset of a non smoker again. The plus side is when I am not at work I still don’t think about smokes so I know I have to do this before the urges completely take over again where I feel like smokes all the time like a regular smoker does.  There really is no such thing as just one smoke, I should know that from times I have quit in the past and failed.

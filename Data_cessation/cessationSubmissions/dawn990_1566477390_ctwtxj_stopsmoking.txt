Not first time here, not first time quiting, no IRL support

My boyfriend (for now, because I'm more and more feed up) laughed the other day when I used *"Imagine if I quit smoking..."* as an example. For him it was soooo funny because I'd never quit, I love it too much. Little side note, he is recovering addict so this took me by surprise even more. I never expected from him to mock my addiction.

Today, literal 4 minutes after I woke up, my dad decided it's the best time to lecture me on smoking too much. Not only that, I also smoke "wrong" because putting cigarette in a ash tray and typing a text is a no go. You need to hold it. Yes, that's some weird bullshit I don't even wanna write anymore.

So... Since it happened before I even took my morning medicine it also means I didn't have my morning coffee and cigarette routine.

It's been 4 and a half hours only, but I still haven't light a cigarette. Every time that idea crosses my mind this little petty bitch in my head is like *"suck it up and rub it in their faces"*.

I wasn't successful in my trying-s before because I don't have needed will power. I like my addiction and it likes me.

I have all the reasons to quit, I know benefits, I know how it could be great health vise, but I'm scare of failing *again*.

There is no one to talk to now, so I just needed to vent.

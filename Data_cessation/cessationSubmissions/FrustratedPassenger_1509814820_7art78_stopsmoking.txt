Day one

In a little over 3 hours I’ll have my first day. It’s not too bad so far. Just as long as nobody annoys me I’m good. I can’t stay away from everyone for ever but the first few weeks I’m sleeping as much as I want, doing as much yoga I can get in. I took the Monday &amp; Tuesday after thanksgiving off from work  so I don’t stress myself during the holiday.

Smoked for 5 years. Haven't had nicotine in over 2 days. I have energy and strength I forgot I ever had.

I never realized nicotine had a negative effect on testosterone, hormones, the brain, all that good stuff. I feel like I"m going through puberty again for a second time! 

If you're debating quitting smoking, DO IT! I don't mean just smoking, I mean nicotine, too. This drug fucks your body up way more than you realize. I had completely forgotten what life was like before nicotine, but man, I'm sure as hell never going back! 

Also, am I the only one experiencing this? I see people saying "100 days without smoking!" but they never mention this incredible difference in quality of life. That's way more important than how many god damned days you haven't smoked for. Tell it like it is! It's worth it to quit this shit!

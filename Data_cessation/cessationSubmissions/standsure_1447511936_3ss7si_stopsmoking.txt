Yep. That'll be two weeks years thanks.

I didn't quit on my first attempt. 

I read Alan Carr four times over fifteen years.  

Because I'd practiced quitting I recognised the quit window when it came and grabbed on tight. 

I made quitting a game. Addiction shaped where I walked and governed my daily actions and decisions for decades. Now I had new choices. Actual choices. Preference based choices. Making quitting a game helped me get through the critical first ten days. 

I started smoking unfiltered Camels at good fifteen and smoked for twenty three years. 


I promise if I can stay stopped. You can. You're amazing.

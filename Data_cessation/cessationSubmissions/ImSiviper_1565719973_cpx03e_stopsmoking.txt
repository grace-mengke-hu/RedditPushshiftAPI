Weird thought about quiting

It may sound kind of strange but here we go. My mom has been smoking ever since i was born. Sometimes id think about new ways to help her quit smoking, in ways that don't exist yet. Im very intressed in the study revolving the human brain and how we can kind of "trick it".

 The idea was; imagine making new habits ( like eating an apple, doing a new activity. Etc) and when you start making these new habits you make sure that you never smoke during them. What if after a couple of months furter you made so many new small habits that the  smoking goes away after a couple of months?

Thought thiw belonged here ( not sure ). Let me think what you guys think.

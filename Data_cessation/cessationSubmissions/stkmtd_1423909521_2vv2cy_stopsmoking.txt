crossing my previous record

36 days was previously the farthest I've gone. I'm in just as much peril now as I was then (remain vigilant!), but overall this quit has had a lot more positivity behind it.

Here's to setting a new record I won't be able to beat :)

Looking forward to not smoking with the rest of you.

Day 1. Scared AF but also determined AF.....

Day 1 again.  If I don't take the bull by the horns it will take me.   I'm 39, been a smoker for most of my adult life with the exception of a few quits that have lasted 3-6 months....lately have turned to chain smoking in garage as compulsive "last chance" smoking.  Just noticed for the first time that my index and middle fingers are stained yellow.  Gross. Now I regret the pretty manicure I got that draws attention to my hands.
I'm off on a business trip and will use the change in normal life to bank some good smoke free time.  
Just need to remember that cravings always pass. And I know this for sure!!! When I've made it a few weeks smoke free it is always a choice to go back in.  And I know first hand that I barely even think about smoking when I get past the first few days / weeks.  Please help me stay strong and accountable!

cigarettes & anxiety

so, first of all, ignore that wonderful star next to my name: unfortunately I started to smoke again this summer..
anyways, Lately I have been smoking not much (like 1 -3 cigs a day), which is pretty good for me, unfortunately it pisses me off, that i somehow cant do one day without a cig at all (which proves i am still addicted).. 
anyway, when I am stressed, i sometimes go through anxiety problems, and i believe smoking doesnt help.. I also read that smoking cigarettes increases anxiety. With that being said, I wanted to know if anyone of you who suffered from anxiety got better while quitting? did it help at all? thx

day 6

Hello everyone!

This is my first post in the section. I am on day 6 of no smoking!

I have never been a pack a day smoker but more or less a half pack. I've been smoking for 11 years and decided to go cold turkey. 

I don't really have cravings, except when driving. I have found that a nice play list to belt the vocals to or a water bottle will cease those cravings in about 5 minutes. 

Not one more puff, so far so good. 

It feels good to breathe.

To everyone on this journey, keep going. We have this.

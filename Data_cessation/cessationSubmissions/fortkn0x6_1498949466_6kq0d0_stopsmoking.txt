I need help and opinions from people who are succeeding at this

I'm in college and I'm not a heavy smoker. I used to smoke 7-8 cigarettes a day.
I've pulled that number down to a constant of 5 now. But whatever I do or however much I try, it just doesn't go down from 5. 
And I really want to quit now. I must. 

I'm sharing my trigger times: 
1. withing 30 mins of waking up. 
2. After lunch (around 2)
3. at 5 pm. 
4. At 7. 
5. At 9 or 9:30 (This is the toughest one. I try to let it go after the 4th one but I keep failing). 

So methods, suggestions, it's all welcome. 

P.S- I've tried Nicotine gums.

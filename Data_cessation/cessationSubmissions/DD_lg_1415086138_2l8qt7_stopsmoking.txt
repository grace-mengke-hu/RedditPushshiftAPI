Just Quit Smoking, Advice? This is so hard Grrrrr

Hey guys, I recently got a cold (Friday to be exact) and yesterday I decided I would smoke my last cigarette. This decision is partly due to the disgusting cough I developed from smoking through this cold and due to the fact that I really can't afford cigarettes anymore. So, today was my first day and it FUCKING SUCKED. The only thing I thought about was cigarettes, and how badly I wanted one. So I have gum and mints and those have kinda helped with the oral fixation part but does anyone have any advice on how to make this any less sucky? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated :) have a great november, folks :).

2 weeks down, feel AMAZING

so a little over a month ago I stopped smoking pot, and my luungs improved dramatically, so I decided to stop smoking cigarettes as well, I've been smoking since I was 14, besides the fact that i can actually BREATH, there is one more thing I noticed, and all I have to ask is...when did food have this much FLAVOUR? everything tastes so amazing, basic ham & cheese sandwich used to be blah, now the mustard pops everything tastes AMAZING, I really didn't know food could taste so fucking good. Hot pockets, sandwiches, BURGERS, Taco bell , EVERYTHING, I'll never smoke another cigarette again, I'm never giving up these taste buds

How to help someone quit smoking

Ok so I'm a smoker myself but I'm writing this post to get tips on how I can help my wife to quit smoking.

She's 27 and been a regular smoker since a long time. Now due to some medical issues she really needs to quit or else her condition would be serious. Although she has reduced the number of cigarettes she smoked daily, from 10-15 to 5-6 now, but I want her to quit totally. She's also suffering from anxiety so whenever i try to hide the cigarettes she gets annoyed and starts an argument. 

Any tips and suggestion wilp be welcome

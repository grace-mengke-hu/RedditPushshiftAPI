Could use a little specific advice

Hey there, this is like my third or fourth post here in like four days, so I feel like I should really fix my flair lol. I will just explain it again real quick though. I tried quitting twice this year, and just never changed it. This is my third quit and I am going strong, but my flair says I quit in February or whatever.

Anyways, I am actually approaching the two week mark of quitting, it is currently day 12 and I feel like I am doing really well this time. I already practically don't think about cigarettes! However, I happen to be in the military, and I just got three months off (fuck yeah, beard time!). Unfortunately, I have to report back after this coming weekend; and the army, as a lot of other soldiers can probably attest to, is significantly where I smoke the most.

I actually found it kind of easy to quit smoking on my own this time, but I am pretty worried about going to my unit this time, because all my friends are going to keep smoking and offering me cigarettes (with the best of intentions, in their defense). I know I sound like a five year old, but I feel like with all of them taking smoke breaks and my normal army schedule it will be wicked hard to stop smoking there.

Anybody from the army or a similar organization quit before? What kinda tricks are there that make the work smoking easier to get by? Should I just stay away from the guys I normally chill with, even though they are my best friends there?

Fuck man, even thinking about it makes me want one! I shall persevere in the face of this adversity though!

Hi r/stopsmoking, I've wanted to meet you all for a really long time...

Ok well I haven't made any kind of huge accomplishment just yet, but I haven't had a cigarette in 9 hours (for me thats HUGE since I've been awake for those 9 hours) and I want to go the distance and quit for good!  I'm having such an easier time reading all of the success on here so I feel a lot better than I thought at this point. I'll give a little overview of my smoking history.  I'm currently 29 and have been smoking regularly since just about 15.  I can sometimes smoke 2+ packs a day (weekends, days off etc...)   but normally smoke a pack and a half or so.  There are so many unknowns in the future but I can feel what I believe to be the early stages of COPD coming on at 29 and to be honest...smoking is nowhere near worth having respiratory issues for the rest of my life.  I keep picturing myself in a hospital bed hooked up to machines asking myself "Why didn't you just stop to avoid all of this?  Why did you let it get to this?  Was it worth it?!!"  

Well thats where I'm at currently and I don't feel like killing anyone yet which is good.  I honestly expected worse by this point but we'll see how it goes I suppose.  I look forward to speaking with some of you awesome people!!!

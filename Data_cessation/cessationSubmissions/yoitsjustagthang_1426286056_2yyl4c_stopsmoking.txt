One month without smoking.

I'll keep this short. I have been a smoker since 14. I am 21 now, almost 22. So I smoked for about 7 years, probably irreparably harming my development somehow. I have tried to quit before but always failed. I have never gotten this far before. So why now? A month ago my grandma went into the hospital. She smoked for 30 years ever since she was 17 and quit. She died a week after going into the hospital (she was 89) because of a laundry list of conditions caused by smoking. I vowed the day she went into the hospital she would not die in vain. Every cigarette I don't smoke is in her memory. Love you gramma. RIP.

The children are Proud 2

It's now a little more than 4 years. The idea that this is when I'd smoke no longer occurs, no craves, but there are moments when the question "Would a cigarette help"? arises. My answer is always no. It's a truth I'm certain of. I think the most successful quits are the ones that dispel all the fantasies and beliefs we build around our addiction, the whys and hows that it attaches itself to everything we do. It is high tech brainwashing and the only truth there is is that it's totally an addiction. 

I lost my mom recently. I still cry everyday but not once did I think to smoke. I wish so many things, but never for that. Just as surely as smoking won't bring my mom back it also won't/can't make missing and loving her easier, it also won't help or diminish  the beauty of sunsets, the brightness of a sunrise, the tranquility of a balcony or the heartache of a breakup. It's not a diet aide and no doctor ever prescribed it for weight loss, depression, constipation, diarrhea or acne. All those things and beliefs are manifestations of addiction and how addiction attaches itself to everything by its very nature. They are false associations.

The free e-book Freedom From Nicotine and this sub helped me learn all these things. Helped me beat all the falsehoods into the ground until they were just ash. I believe I am free because I can't imagine a place for smoking in my life, that an addiction will be something I need. That would be the consequence of a smoke with no gain at all. 

One day at a time guys. I am happy to bring this to you and proud of all of us. Happy New Year!!!!

A special shout out to u/my_vape_self, u/sonsue, u/Armison and u/BikeRidinMan and my mom, who also quit before me after 60+ years of smoking. They were my lights in the tunnel

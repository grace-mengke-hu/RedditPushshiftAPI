New neighbor smokes and I don't

Hi, 

I don't smoke (it gives me headaches/dry throat and such), but my new neighbor smokes in his apartment almost non-stop.  As my building is old it permeates through the ceiling/walls and has a pretty strong aroma.  

I've spoken to him with no real change.  Is there anything I can do on my end to lessen the stench/physical effects?

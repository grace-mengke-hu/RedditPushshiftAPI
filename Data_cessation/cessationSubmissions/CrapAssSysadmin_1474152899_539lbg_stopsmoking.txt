Fiance and I are compiling our evidence for a tribunal case we're going to file.

I might actually bite a bitch.

I already ate 2 pounds of chocolate. 

We've been fighting and filling out paperwork for 4 consecutive hours.

I want to scream and cry and say cutting things.

And smoke.

But I won't.

I won't ingest nicotine OR insult my fiance.

But FUCK I want to.

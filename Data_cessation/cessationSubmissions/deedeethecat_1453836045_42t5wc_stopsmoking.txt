Not smoking during hard times

Last night I was at the hospital with my husband. A friend was on life support, and died this morning at 4 am. He died due to drug abuse, essentially. He had emergency heart surgery, and  following the surgery all of his organs began to fail.

This would have been a reason to smoke. Stress, sorrow, loss. But I chose not to smoke because my quitting smoking is not dependent on life circumstances.

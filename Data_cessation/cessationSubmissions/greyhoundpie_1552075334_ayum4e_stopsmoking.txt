Had my first big crisis (5 days in)

Hi friends. Stopped smoking after almost 20 years this past Saturday. I'm, on the patch and everything is going great. Even managed to cut my canabis consumption down by probably 80% which is great. I used to mix it with tobacco.

Anyways, I work as a carpenter and I would always smoke when I'm driving (I don't like to take smoke brakes of my customers are around). Today I went to home depot for some materials and on my way, out of their parking lot I sort of had a mini break down. First little while I had no idea what was going on but then I remembered that my body/mind was really used to getting a cigerettes leaving that specific parking lot. I started crying for some reason and just parked for a few minutes and didn't know what to do. Good thing was that I wasn't anywhere near buying smokes or anything, I was just so surprised with the vulnerability that rushed over me. I called my wife and we had a good chat and I went back to work. First major craving since I quit 5 days ago.

Anyways, just wanted to share. Stay string people!

Repeat after me: Not another puff no matter what :D

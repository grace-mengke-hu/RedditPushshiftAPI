I don't think this is a craving...

So I'm on day 3 with patches.  I did this whole thing already in the past, and I know once I get to about day 5 everything gets better quickly.  But I'm having a rough day this afternoon.  Everyone talks about the cravings coming and going, but that's not what I experience.  Mine is a full mind fog, completely tense body, and zero ability to think about anything else.  This "craving" has lasted more than an hour now.  I know I'm not going to smoke, but holy fuck is it unpleasant.  I've had cravings on and off since I stopped smoking mostly out of routine, but this is ridiculous.  Anyone have any idea what this feeling is if it isn't a craving?

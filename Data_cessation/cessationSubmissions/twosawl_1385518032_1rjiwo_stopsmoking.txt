Greetings, This is possibly my last attempt to quit.

Hello Reddit,

I've tried a million things to quit and I am on my last attempt.

This time I am doing something far different.  I am going to make a stop smoking app for android, during the testing process I am going to see how well it works, if it can get me to quit it can get anyone to.



What I have been trying to look for and was hoping either one of you knew or knew a subreddit to ask, But how exactly does one go about calculating the benefits of quitting smoking, such as:

* Carbon monoxide level dropping (or rising for sneaking a smoke)
* Heart risk improvement per day
* lung improvement per day
* smell and taste improvement
* circulation

Thanks reddit!

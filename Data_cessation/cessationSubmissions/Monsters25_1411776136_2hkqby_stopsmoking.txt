I need help for my addiction...

I smoked for over  twenty years. In the end I despised it, and the control nicotine had over me.  Slowly destroying not only my physical health, but also my mental health. When I started smoking It was pretty benign, one here or there until eventually I couldn't control it.  The anxiety of running out was more than I could take.  I had quit twice for pregnancy, so I know it could be done. When I finally quit I realized the physical withdrawal wasn't the problem. It's the mental dependency that I can't seem to handle. The cravings are bad, but I know I'm stronger.   The evenings are the worst though.  The only thing that helps are frozen juice pops. Thank goodness they are lower in calorie, ore I'd be even more over weight. I eat at least four a night. I crave them at work also and figured out a way to pack one in my lunch, which is odd since I never smoked at work to begin with.  I just need to know it will stop and I'm not going to have to fight the cravings every night forever.  I keep trying to remember I smoked for over twenty years, that habit isn't going to go away in a month or even two.  Right?

If Allen Carr is right, why do people start smoking again?

I think Allen Carr is mostly correct in his views on how to quit smoking. It helped me to quit for 10 years. I relapsed and have been back at it for a few years. Why do you think that people who understand Carr relapse? And why is it difficult to quit again? There must be more to it than forgetting.

Day 10 bumpier than expected

But still hanging in there. It'll be day 11 in about 2 hours. Not sure where those Day 10 cravings came from, but they were stronger than anything since day 4 wtf?!

Anyway - fuck you addict-brain. I pulled through. And the only reason you're still talking is because i smoked for so damn long. I'm building new & better habits one day at a time.

Stay strong everyone.

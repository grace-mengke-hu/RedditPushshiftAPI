Slipped :(

This morning, I was doing fine without the patch, so I decided to leave it off for the day. My mom was coming over -- I'd asked her to not bring cigarettes, but she did, so I spent the next few hours fighting off my addict brain telling me to ask her for one. Addict won out -- I had 1.5 cigarettes and then felt dizzy and regretful.

Starting over now, hoping I can do it again for good...

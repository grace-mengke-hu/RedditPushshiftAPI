Smelling Cigarettes

I went out running this morning and I swear I was a block behind this guy smoking a cigarette and I could smell it. And it smelled so freakin' gross.

What an exciting moment! Not only was I amazed that I could smell that far away, but I was so stoked that it didn't smell at all appealing. Bam.

Asthmatic guy, haven't smoked since NYE - I feel high on O2! But, bought an e-cig. . . Thoughts?

I went cold turkey for the first four days, skiing everyday in Golden, Canada.  No problems, but a lot of gasping and hacking.  Now on day 6, I'm feeling literally high on oxygen.  Every breath is astonishing.  But... yesterday I bought an e-cig （with nic juice） and puffed it a few times now that I'm back at work.  It tastes great, has anyone been successful with these, or is it a recipe for disaster?

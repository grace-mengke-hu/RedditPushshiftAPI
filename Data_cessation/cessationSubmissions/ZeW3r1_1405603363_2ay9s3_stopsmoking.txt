Quitting today!

Gonna go in cold turkey starting today after couple of failed tries to stop with lowering the amount, it just didn't work. I smoked 3 and half years about 10-15 smokes a day before coming to realization that i'm not going anywhere but backwards with this habit. Compared to for example some of my friends, they have smoked a lot longer than me and 3 & Â½ years ain't THAT bad, but it's still bad. I'm still young and i would like to enjoy this life without any restrictions from smoking. I know i can do this and to everyone of you, stay strong!

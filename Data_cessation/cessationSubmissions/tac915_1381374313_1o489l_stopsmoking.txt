60 Day wall

So I made it 60 days, hung around smokers, still managed to not smoke. The cravings hounded me, day 60 I took a puff, day 61 I smoked a cigarrette, day 62 I bought a pack and smoked them all. I really really want to quit, I start chantix again tomorrow. I know it's just my mind trying to trick itself into convincing me to smoke. What do I do to stand a better chance this time?

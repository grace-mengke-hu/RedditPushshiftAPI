Quit Cigarettes but not Nicotine

I have been smoking for nine years now, the dopamine effect for me is always a lot more than a normal person from what I hear from my friends and used to smoke a pack a day. 

I’ve given up cigarettes now for a week and have taken up Juul instead. To be honest, I miss the cigarette every day but it is getting better. However, I am taking in much more nicotine than I used to smoking cigarettes. I easily kill two 20mg pods a day, sometimes three a day when I’m drinking.

Is it better to try quitting this way by increasing the nicotine intake just to get away from the pleasure of a cigarette and then try to wean off of the nicotine addiction later it I’m just lying to myself and falling into a bigger black hole?

Could really use some advice and motivation.

This sub has been amazing in helping me make my mind to give this habit up and focus on not being addicted anymore.

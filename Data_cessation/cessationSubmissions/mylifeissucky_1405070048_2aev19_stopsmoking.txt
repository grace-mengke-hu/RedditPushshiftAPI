I know what I save a month by NOT smoking and will NOT be Using toward smokes...

I used to spend over 78 dollars or more on cigarettes over a month. I cannot believe that I have now saved the 78 dollars+ and have been able to buy things I want and NO MORE to the cogarettes. Even more, the triggers have to be worked on until I get it ironed out. Common triggers are being at Walmart and shopping. I have to watch myself closely so far.

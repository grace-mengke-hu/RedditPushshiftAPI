There's more time in the day since I quit

I start work at 3:30 PM and I like to leave around 2:30 to avoid after school traffic. Normally I would leave my apartment, stand outside and smoke, drive to work, smoke in the parking lot, make my coffee, then go outside for one last smoke then start my day. Now I still leave around 2:30, get to work around 2:50, and get to sit and read and drink my coffee for a few minutes before work instead of smoking. It's nice! 

Also, I never have to stop and pick up cigarettes before work. I feel like I rush around much less since quitting, I'm a lot calmer.

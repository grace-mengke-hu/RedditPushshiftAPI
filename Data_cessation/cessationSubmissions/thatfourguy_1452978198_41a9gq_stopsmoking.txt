Trying again, hopefully for the last time.

I have tried to quit smoking several times, however I can never make it past about 3 months before I pick it back up.  I'm trying again today because when I woke up this morning, I couldn't breathe without a noticeable wheeze when both inhaling and exhaling.  I've been coughing much more nowadays, I can't climb stairs without breathing hard, I'm hacking up phlegm all day, it's just terrible.  I noticed the other day as I put on my coat that, while I don't smoke in the house, my coat and scarf smelled like an ashtray.  I want to stop wasting money on cigarettes.  

I want to quit, I need to quit.  I just need help.  I've also decided to quit drinking, as drinking encourages this bad behavior (and it's a good idea me to stop drinking as well). 

I've fought with this for so long.  Every time I quit I feel like I'm losing a friend, in a weird way.  I hate how I am when I am going through withdraws, and I have a hard time dealing with stress without smoking.  

I'm going to try again.  If you have any advice, I would gladly appreciate it.

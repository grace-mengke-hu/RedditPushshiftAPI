Got my wish, first cold since quitting smoking

...and I feel great! 

I'm not causing further inflammation of my nasal passages. I don't have that feeling in my chest that may or may not be the beginning of a bronchitis. I'm not feeling guilty about needing the nicotine fix even though I'm sick, smoking myself miserable.

I am just nursing a little cold like a normal person. It started yesterday and though I am still congested I feel pretty darn good and I am fairly certain this will not turn into one of those that linger, and linger, and linger. Yay :)

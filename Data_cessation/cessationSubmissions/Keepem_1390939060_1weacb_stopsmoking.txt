I don't crave like I used to!

Fellow Nonsmokers!

I would like to report in that all the months are finally paying off. I haven't had a craving for a cigarette in at least a month! It has recently gotten cold here in my state, and the smokers I were with just kept grunting as they made their way to the door to step outside to have a smoke. I was just grateful I wasn't in the circle!

I remember the beginning though when all I could do was not smoke. Just laying in bed. It was my full time job in the first few days. Once the break was over, I got back to work. I struggled. I would get a coffee and fuss. Riding in my car would almost take me out. I didn't get a full night sleep for at least 3 weeks. 

I can now say that it is behind me. I am not suffering from the addiction anymore! You can do it too! Now that I'm free, I've had more money, more focus, no annoying cravings (the real blessing!) and I have focused on exercising, getting healthy, cutting out other bad habits.

Life is good!

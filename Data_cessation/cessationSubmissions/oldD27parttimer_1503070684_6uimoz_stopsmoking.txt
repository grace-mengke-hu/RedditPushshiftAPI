nicotine and rotator cuff tear healing. Really?

I had no frickin idea. yeah I found this shit on the internet, but my shoulder does feel better. Rotator cuff tear a little over a year ago.

Smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death. ... Rotator cuff (shoulder) tears in smokers are nearly twice as large as those in nonsmokers, ...

Cigarette smoking (nicotine) impedes tendon-to-bone healing.

Just another reason to quit!

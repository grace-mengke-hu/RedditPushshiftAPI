Did You Know.. quitting smoking sucks! .. then feels good! .. then f*!@N sucks.. then feels oh so good! .. then bad .. ... ah BUT so FRESH!

Been testing the waters lately and pushing myself when I get the urge. I should also mention that I am taking a prescription drug (ch___ix), makes me feel like shit, and I feel like a smoke when I'm having a smoke, weird.. but helps me think about the real seriousness of it.

I have never been without cigarettes in my mature life, have always admitted to my love for them. It is now over. This is WAR.
Any support is greatly encouraged, and appreciated as this is not going to be easy :/

edit: You supporters won't believe me, but you have helped me more than anyone.. IRL & WWW. I wish you all eternal cleanliness of the respiratory system.

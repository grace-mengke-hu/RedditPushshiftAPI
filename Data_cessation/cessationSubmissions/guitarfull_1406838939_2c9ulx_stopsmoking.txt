Not doing well :(

I "quit" 24 days ago, I made it 18 days without a puff, then broke down and bought a pack and smoked like 16 over 3 days before I threw the rest out...brutal.  Its been 4 days since I had one and my mind knows not to ever do that again but I'm feeling almost as much anxiety as I was on day 3 initially.  Anyone ever deal with this stupidity before?  Am I really going through nicotine withdrawal again?

Day 3, first day back at high pressure job. When will the cravings stop?

I decided to quit friday night, I had one last bash at the pub - smoked an entire deck then locked myself in the house on saturday/sunday. Now It's mid day and I'm at work. I work in finance, trading specifically - it's very high pressure and very stressful. It's killing me. I can't focus at all and all I can think about is smoking. I'm about to get someone to fill in for me for the rest of the day, it would be negligent to manage money in my current state. Also, almost everyone here is a smoker and I need to remove myself from the temptation, the guys are offering them to me non stop for a laugh (pricks). My question is - when does it get better? From your experience - when does smoking become just something you used to do? When were you able to stop actively forcing yourself to not smoke?

one year. cold turkey. :)

365 days ago. I ran out of cigarettes. Decided not to buy them that day. A day turned into a week. A week turned into a month. A month turned into a year! After a 13 year relationship, I had to say goodbye to something to hurt me physically, financially and emotionally. To all you who are struggling, just remember. You were a non-smoker before being a smoker. You don't need those things to define who you are. You should be the one defines who you are.

Two weeks smoke free, resisted the urge last night!

Got addicted to nicotine by mixing tobacco with my weed. Quit two weeks ago.  Last night I watched two of my friends pass a spliff back and forth while resisting some of the most intense cravings I’ve had so far, but I stayed strong by reminding myself how much I would regret taking that one hit, as that’s how I’d relapsed previously.  NOT worth it!



Just wanted to share a small victory! Good luck on y’alls quit journeys.

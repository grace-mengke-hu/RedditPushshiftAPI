My boss just pissed me off to no end, and I can't stop smiling :)

Because, I'm sitting here realizing that I'm not interested in going to grab a smoke.  So many relapses have happened after a blow up at work over the last 20 years.  

This time is so different.  In large part to this subreddit.

Thanks!  WOOT!  I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY RIGHT NOW!!!

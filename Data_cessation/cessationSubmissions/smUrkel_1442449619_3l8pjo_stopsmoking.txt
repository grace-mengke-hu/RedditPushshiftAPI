I got to tick the 'non-smoker' box.

It's been almost a year since I quit (have had a couple hiccups, but nothing major, and nothing in the last few months). Yesterday, I had to get a colposcopy on my cervix and I filled out the admitting form as a non-smoker. It felt amazing! Even better, they asked me to cough during the procedure and said "No smokers in the group today, such dainty coughing!" 

Proud of myself, my dainty coughs, and the 20 or so other women before me. Keep strong, /r/stopsmoking, and thanks for sharing your stories!

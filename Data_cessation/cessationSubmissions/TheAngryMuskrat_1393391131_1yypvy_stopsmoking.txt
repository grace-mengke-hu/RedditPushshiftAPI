It's been just around 48hrs and I have "extinguished" my backups...

The time has come. [I just ran these 8 or so cigs under the faucet so I couldn't be tempted anymore (kept them in a drawer for the past two days).](http://i.imgur.com/dB0kD5L.jpg)

This shit ain't easy; been a pack-a-day smoker for roughly 11 years and am now on my 5th week of still-smoking Chantix. It's time. I know how completely terrible they are for me but I haven't wanted to stop. I hate the way my clothes and hands smell at the end of the day. I hate that my wife hates how I smell. I hate that I feel like I need them so much right now without having one in over two days... 

I've never felt so frustrated/relieved at the same time. This blows. I'm gonna make it. This subreddit has already helped me a lot tonight. 

Thank y'all.

I bought a vape, and the patch. Time to try quit, for rhe hundreth time, hopefully the last

Someone once told me that because I have bipolar I have an 80% chance of failing quitting. Well, I have tried to quit now literally one hundred times, and failed every time. Using poor math and the power of ignorance, I figure if I have tried 100 times, and failed 100 times, statistically speaking, the odds are in my favor to quit. 

I started at 15. When I was 17 I was smoking two packs a day. Now that I am 25 I am inbetween half a pack and 3/4 a pack a day. I tried two weeks ago, succeeded to quit for 3 days until I caved. 

I start tomorrow morning. I have 3 cigarettes in my pack left. I don't plan to smoke them tonight, but if I do I will forgive myself. I have transferred all of my money into my savings account, and prepped meals and the like so I don't have to use cash during the week. It's hovering around -15 to -20 right now, which is perfect because I loathe the cold, and cannot smoke inside. 

I am slightly confident. I have failed so many times, made it to day 8 so many times to fall back onto smokes. This time, I will be armed, this time, I will be brave, this time I will be bold.

Also I've been coughing up bloody phlem and black phlem, so I am also armed with the fear of cancer, which should be a driving force. And I have an infected tooth that hurts if I smoke. So I think I have a lot of cards stacked on my side. 

Wish me luck! 
 
I know I'll need it.

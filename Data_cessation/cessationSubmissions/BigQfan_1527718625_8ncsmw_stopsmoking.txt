I broke down

So, I think I’m roughly 6 months into it now. It’s been hard and I still get cravings but I didn’t give in...UNTIL...a week ago Monday my wife and I got into a HUGE fight. Out of frustration I fired up(I still have the pack I quit on, it has 3 cigs left). I took 3 drags on it and caught myself. I put it out and haven’t gone back since. I don’t know if that counts as a failure or not but I wanted to get it off my chest. Yeah, I know I should throw those smokes away but there is still something comforting about knowing they are there.

After smoking for all of my teenaged years, I decided to quit just before my 21st birthday. That was 75 days ago and I would like to thank everyone here.

Just some background: I had been trying to quit for many months unsuccessfully and lurked on this Sub for quite a while. I was getting very ill from my smoking, so much that I was becoming lethargic in my junior year of college. I knew that I had to stop but kept failing to actually quit. Finally after reading so many stories on this sub I was able to quit this summer. I've been improving my life ever since, going to the gym, eating right, ending unhealthy relationships, finding out which relationships were really good for me, you name it.  Only now am I making the transition to accepting being a nonsmoking person; I am beginning to think of it as something odd that people continue to do. Even still, I must check these forums and my counter nearly everyday to recognize what I've done. I guess where I'm getting to is - I'm forever appreciative of the people here even though I've never actually spoken to any of you. I think after a long time of wishing I could put an end to the mistake I made during my adolescence that I can finally say I made it. To the rest of you here I wish to say - were all going to make it!

8 months!! Thanks!!

I started smoking when I was 12 years old. Last year I turned 30 and I quitted!  After 18 years of at least 30 a day and hardly any memory of how it was to live without a cigarette, I am now 8 months clean. To all of you out there: you help(ed) me a lot! Thanks! I will come back now and then to reinforce my motivation and to hear some healthy thoughts.

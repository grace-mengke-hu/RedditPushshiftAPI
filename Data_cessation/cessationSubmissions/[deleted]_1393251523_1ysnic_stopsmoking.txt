Today is Day One (multiple previous attempts).

Longest period of abstinence I had recently was 15 days. Was sick this weekend and smoked my way through it like a true addict, and got myself to a point of such self-loathing and disgust with myself that I decided today needs to be Day One (again). 

Wish me luck. Thanks.

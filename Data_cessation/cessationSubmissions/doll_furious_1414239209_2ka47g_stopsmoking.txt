I slipped yesterday and now I'm consumed with guilt.

I've been quit for almost 3 months now but my partner is still a smoker so there are always cigarette packs and halfies lying around. I've slipped a couple of times before this but for some reason, I smoked one of those halfies yesterday and I just feel awful about myself. When I first quit I took up running to keep me motivated reduce stress but I'm laid up with an injury and can only sit around trying to no smoke. I wish this guilt would disperse and I could forgive myself.

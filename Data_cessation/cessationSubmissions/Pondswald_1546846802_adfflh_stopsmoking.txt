Three weeks!

I've made it to three weeks not smoking after smoking a pack a day for 9 years! Never thought I'd make it this far, since I always caved after a few days. NRT definitely made it more bearable though (using patches), and my motivation most definitely helps. 

Right now, I already had a few milestones. I've spend afternoons and evenings with other smokers, who even smoke inside there houses. I've survived seeing my boyfriend going outside to smoke, since he didn't quit. I successfully drank beers without smoking. I even got drunk on NYE at my sister in law's (who smokes inside), without smoking. I survived hearing terrible news twice, and didn't smoke (two people I know have cancer, it turns out). I got mad, and I didn't smoke.

So yeah, I'm feeling pretty proud of myself. However, I did have two hard days before today. I had a lot of cravings that crept up on me. But I pulled through and didn't cave. Also, the patches are causing a terrible itch these days when I put them on. Can't wait to get rid of those too (but I will stick with the program, since I don't want to fail because of quitting those too early). Also, I'm still feeling a bit tired. But I'm going swimming today, in the hopes of getting more energy by working out.

With every hard/great situation I've been in the last three weeks, where I did not smoke, I learned something important. Cigarettes do not help you in these situations. They don't make it better, more fun or less awful. **They do nothing**. And every time something (good or bad) happens, and I don't smoke, I feel the addiction getting less. 

Stay strong everyone! If I can quit, so can you! We got this!

A bit of morbid motivation

I actually use fear as my motivation sometimes, not the whole thing of scare tactics more a real insight of new and relevant research that time and time again is proven with the people around you. This worries me;

So scientist found that approx every 10 cigs smoked cause a mutation in the body. Mostly these are in the lungs but also in many other areas of the body.  Cell mutations cause cancer, and I don't just mean now, I mean for the next 15 years too! 

So say I gave up smoking today, it's only once 15 years have passed that I can be sure the cancer wasn't caused by smoking. It's takes that long for the cells to disappear and be reproduced and reproduced without any. Those cells are dangerous and remain dangerous for a long time. Stopping smoking doesn't take away the the risk instantly. 

So why am I telling you this? We'll because once you know this information you slowly but surely hear the information proving this science as you carry on your day to day life. My grandad died of lung cancer 2 years after he'd quit, now I understand why. Two celebs I have recently read about have been diagnosed with cancer and it turns out they were smokers less that 15 years ago.
Even in interviews both said "I used to smoke but have been quit for years!" People don't think it will happen to them, and it could!! I now think every day is a day closer to passing that 15 year mark, once that's over I'll feel much more confident in my health, until then I've just gotta keep going. It's true, smoking does cause cancer whether we choose to ignore it or not. 

Never quit quitting! Xx

I want to stop smoking cigarettes but still want to smoke weed.

Please let me know if this isn't the right place to post.

I am a cigarette and weed smoker of about 5 years now. Picked them both up together, and I've had enough of everything to do with smoking cigarettes, however I mix both tobacco and weed when smoking, and only smoke cigarettes when at work/not smoking from the pipe.

The reason why I mix them both is because a) weed is quite harsh when smoked by itself, and becomes easy to smoke when mixed with tobacco and b) because weed is expensive, it helps make the small bag last.

I don't want to stop smoking weed because I honestly believe that I have a mental disorder along the lines of ADHD but I'm not going to get myself diagnosed and thrown onto doctor's candy. I become extremely temperamental, short with everyone, snappy and just an all-round asshole when I don't smoke weed. No amount of cigarettes will calm that anger. 

Is this a hopeless case? I want to know any stories of anyone else who has successfully thrown the tobacco/nicotine side away but still smokes the green. I *really* want to stop smoking cigarettes but if it's going to be a near-impossible struggle because of the weed then please do advise so, any advice is appreciated.

NB: I also don't drink any alcohol, it puts me to sleep, so weed has always been my social drug of choice.

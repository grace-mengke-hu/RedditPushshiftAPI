Seeking advice

Hey all, I'm new to this subreddit and looking for advice on how you all were able to successfully stop smoking. I'm a senior nursing student and hear about the deadly risks of smoking almost every lecture, yet I have continued to smoke almost a pack of cigarettes every day for a year now. Its almost as if I've become desensitized to the warnings and can't scare myself into quitting. This is especially frustrating for me because every time I light up, I'm bombarded with critical self-talk that only makes me feel depressed that I'm doing negative things for my health and well-being. It also makes me feel like my credibility as a nurse is being questioned when I smoke. If I cannot take care of myself how can I give optimal care to others? I used to run long distance just last year and now am out of breath doing trivial amounts of exercise. I am very passionate about my health and this addiction is becoming too much of a burden for me to not seek help. I'd love to read any and all advice I could get from those of you who've tackled this monster, or at least words of encouragement. Thanks in advance!

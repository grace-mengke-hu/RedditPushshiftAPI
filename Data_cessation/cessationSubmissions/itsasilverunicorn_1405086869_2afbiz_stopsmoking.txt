Hello everyone :) second time lucky for me, I hope!

Hi everyone!

I just found this sub today (my first day smokefree on my second attempt).
I quit last year, and I managed to go for ~3 months, but when I came home from university my mum was still smoking (she has since quit and I'm so proud of her), and the temptation was right there. I started smoking her cigarettes every now and then, and before I knew it I was back where I started.

I've decided to try again - I'm a little ashamed to admit the main reason is just because I don't have any money in my bank anymore, so I literally couldn't afford a pack of rolling papers, let alone the rest. But I'm trying to get into the right mindset. I've got plenty of leftover NRT from the last time I gave up, so I'm sat here with a nicotine patch (ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now....)

I'm already stressing out loads, and have screamed at the TV because the presenters were annoying me a couple of times...but I also know from the last time that the first 24 hours are the worst part. I'm just really glad I've found this sub, I'm hoping the inspiration will keep me strong.

Thanks for reading!

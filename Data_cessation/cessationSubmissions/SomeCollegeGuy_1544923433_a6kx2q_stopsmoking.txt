Shortness of breath after quitting?

I had my last smoke on the 9th. I always told myself I would quit once I got out of the Army, and the 9th was my last day. For some reason, in the last few days my chest has felt tight, and I am experiencing a shortness of breath. It almost feels like I just finished a long run. Have any of you had this experience? If so, when did this feeling go away for you?

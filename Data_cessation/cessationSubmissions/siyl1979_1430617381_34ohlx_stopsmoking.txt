Been waiting a long time for this day..

One year anniversary! This time last year I was pissy, super emotional, and couldn't sleep.  I'll be honest, the main reason I didn't light up again was because I didn't want to have to quit and go through all that one more time.  Trust me, it gets easier, and seeing that little smiley face in my flair is icing on the cake :)

Take it from someone who's been there: You can do it too!!

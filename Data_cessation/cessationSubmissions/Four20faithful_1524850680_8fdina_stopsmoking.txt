To those of you who have quit smoking while having significant responsibilities to attend to, what tips do you have to offer to myself and others to be able to power through, while not letting your withdrawals take control and hinder your efforts?

I am very interested to read your answers. As a nicotine addict, I know the strength that you must have had to be able to quit. I admire your efforts, and I am fascinated to hear about your experiences.

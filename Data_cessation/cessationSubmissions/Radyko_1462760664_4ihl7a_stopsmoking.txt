I don't remember not smoking, so here we go, reddit!

Hi reddit,

I started smoking around the age of 13. I am about to turn 20 soon, and realised I don't remember having a social life without smoking. Or just adult life in general. I am responsible for my own choices now more than ever, and if I want to live my life according to the virtues I respect, I have to face my problems. 
Cigarettes most likely made me grow differently than I would have without them. I might be taller. I might have better overall health. Why would I keep doing this to myself? 

About a month ago, I stopped smoking weed completely. I smoked 3 joints since that, and never got to the point where I felt like I need it again. While I'm aware that I can't do this with cigarettes and have to give them up completely, I wonder, if I have the strength to do something in moderation because I know it's not doing good for me otherwise, why would I risk my life every single day more than 25 times? 
So, there goes, reddit. Thank you for reading this if you have. I'm about to go to sleep now, and day 1 starts tomorrow. I am excited! Wish me luck! I hope you'll find the strength to quit, fellow prisoner, and all the best to you, newly free human!

I caved for a couple drags.

Excuse my French, but fuck alcohol, it made my cravings worse. I'm back to 0.

EDIT: Just so people wouldn't do the same mistake: Don't. The cravings are just cravings, they won't make you feel better and you'll just hate yourself for those couple puffs. Keep on going guys!

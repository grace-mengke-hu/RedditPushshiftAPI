Nearly 72 hours in - how did I do this before?

I first quit back in March 2015 after 10 years of heavy smoking; I *had* to quit because I was having a tooth removed, and like hell I was gonna end up with dry socket again. Once the danger of dry socket was gone I started using an e-cigarette, but I still craved smokes.


Then, a few days after my one-year in March 2016, I relapsed, and it's been another two years of heavy smoking since. I've tried to quit again here and there - I'd make it a day, maybe two, and then I'd cave. 


I think my problem is that I can't seem to stop romanticizing them - I miss them. To be honest, I'm only quitting because I legitimately can't afford them anymore - I'm actually in debt because I kept using my credit card to buy smokes. That's not to say I don't want to quit though, it's just not fully by choice right now.


As for what I'm doing to help myself at the moment: I'm using an e-cigarette, I've downloaded a bunch of different quit apps, and I even listened to a hypnosis tape earlier.


I don't know what I'm looking for from this post - maybe just some advice from people on how to stop romanticizing them, and how to change my thinking from "I *have* to do this" to "I'm doing this because I *want* to." Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Feel like I'm going to struggle

I'm 21 years old and I've been smoking for about 4 years; 30 a day for the last year, a pack a day for the two years before that. I had my last cigarette at around 4am 2 nights ago and I read the allen carr book earlier today (It's 02:30 here right now). I had been planning on quitting for a while now and felt the timing was right. The book really helped me understand the addiction and I'm pretty confident I can quit as a result. My main worry, while reading the book and right now is that if I get drunk I won't be able to stop myself. I was at the bar watching the world cup tonight and had about 4 pints, I didn't have a cigarette but was having serious cravings. I reminded myself of all I read and luckily didn't buy a pack. I am worried, however, that when I am more intoxicated and around my friends who smoke I might smoke again. I feel like my sober self will never have a cigarette again but what about if I'm drunk as fuck?

Tl;dr Any advice for a regular binge drinker trying to quit?

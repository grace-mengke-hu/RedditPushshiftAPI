I'm a 20 year old male and I don't know how...

Hi, I'm 20 years old, male. I had my first cigarette in the 9th grade. Out of general curiosity. Smoking looks cool. Period. I loved it and in the years following it, like any other smoker I gradually upped the number of cigarettes I smoked, 1 in 2 months, 1 in a month, 1 in a week, 1 in a day, you know the drill. I always thought I wasn't addicted, till I found out I was but by then it was too late. 1st time I went a couple days without cigarettes I was nauseous after a day and sick the next. I have already tried to quit 3 times in the last 1.5 years, 1st was for 14 days, 2nd 6 days, 3rd 22 days. Each time I relapsed hard and the cigarette hit back harder. This habit punches a big hole in my pocket each month. I'm basically burning that money.



I seriously don't know how to quit, my friends, guys I grew up with are all smokers. So its impossible to hangout with them without smoking. I just had the 4th cigarette of my day and am feeling this mixture of calm and self hate and is it worth it if I have to go through the rest of my life craving for a cigarette every day? I personally know people who were clean for about 2 years and 1 drag of a cigarette was all it took for them to fall off the wagon, I don't know what to do.....

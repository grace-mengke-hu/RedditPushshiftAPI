Tonight marks a week...however.

Thankyou guys, reading all your stories and experiences gave me the motivation I needed to give smoking away.... However...
What on earth do you do to keep your hands and mind busy in social drinking situations?

Last night I had a few mates over for pres, I didn't cave, however the cravings were really strong and had a negative impact on my night.
Ive got a vape with 0% nic which has really helped me get through my moments of weakness but last night that wasn't even helping.


TIA.

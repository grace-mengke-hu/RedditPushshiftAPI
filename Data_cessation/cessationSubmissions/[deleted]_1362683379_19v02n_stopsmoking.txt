Just over a month.

You know, I never thought I'd be able to quit. I smoked cigarettes out of boredom, hunger, etc. and I thought I'd never replace those habits.

But, having the support of everyone helped more than anything.
It's not a big milestone compared to some of you, but I'm proud of myself, and I'm sure my son will be proud of me one day as well.

What are the first steps to quitting?

Hey everyone. I’m new here. I guess I’ll start where I was at my worst with nicotine. 

Last year I was in the states playing hockey, chewing tobacco was extremely cheap. At the worst I was chewing two tins a day, this lasted for about a week until I found Satan’s own USB stick, otherwise known as the Juul. It got me off chew instantly, but I am more hooked on it than I ever was on chew. I don’t even know how to begin to quit. Should I try to cold turkey it? Or should I just lessen my intake over the month? Any advice will help as I’m pretty tired of being a slave to this stupid device. I was never a cigarette smoker, but I’m hoping you all can help me out. Thank you in advance.

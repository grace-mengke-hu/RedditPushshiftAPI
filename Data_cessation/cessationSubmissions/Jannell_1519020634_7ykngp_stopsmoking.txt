I am having a tough time even though it's been so long.

I am so utterly depressed and I can't quit crying like a fucking idiot. No major reasons besides being unemployed, aging, not much social life, being disgusted by current events, etc. 
I'm in therapy and on meds but still just so low.

Today, for whatever reason, has been especially bad with crying. Used to, smoking a cigarette snapped the tear ducts shut and got me back to regular old melancholy. I quit once in my 20s for one-and-a-half years. I got a phonecall about my mom dying and within the hour went and bought a fresh pack "just to ease my hurt." smoked for another 10 years then.

Tonight I've had real cravings for the first time in...forever. I live near a gas station and just keep thinking about walking down there and just smoking the shit out of a pack until I stop crying. 

But I won't. Because I've posted here. I may take a walk. But not to the gas station. Fucking devil cigarettes. If you're reading this, good luck to you as well.

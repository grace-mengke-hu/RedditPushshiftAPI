Troubles

My wife wants me to quit smoking and has for years. I have quit a few times for about 6 months each but I never can stay quit. At this point she is bitter and thinks I just can't do it. I am quitting Tuesday the 20th because I am getting teeth pulled. Where do I start? How do I stay quit? I really wanna just not do it anymore.

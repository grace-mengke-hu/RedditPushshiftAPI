After a miserable relapse on the face of 56 days, I'm back again.14 Days Cold Turkey. I didn't let myself smoke more than 5 days. The withdrawal was not even noticeable.So I strongly suggest everybody, if you ever relapse, quit again as soon as possible. Exercise daily to reduce stress and cravings.

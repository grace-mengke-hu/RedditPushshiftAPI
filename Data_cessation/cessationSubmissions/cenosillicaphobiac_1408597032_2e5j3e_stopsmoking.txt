This weekend (I got this)

Friday is my buddy's bachelor party, we're getting on a fun bus and driving for about 75 minutes to a little town just across the Nevada border for gambling/strip club/etc. fun with about 40 of our bestest friends.

I've always been the smoker, (I've been besties with the groom for 25 years) the guy who has to have a smoke so "I'll meet you in there" etc.  Hell, I would have been chain smoking before the drive, and lighting up as I walked off (they encourage drinking on this bus, the casino wants you loaded already when you walk in the door) probably have the smoke already in my mouth 10 minutes early.

So tonight I smoked a bowl (hooked up in anticipation of the weekend!  I'm the guy in charge of getting the out of town groomsmen high!) and had a couple of beers, that combo is still a minor trigger so I had a dull urge for a smoke.  

Well, it got me thinking about the weekend, and I got a little anxious thinking about it.  I started thinking about being high/drunk/in a casino/expected to be a smoker by my smoking buddies that are always quick to offer quitters smokes/etc. etc. to the point I even wanted a smoke right now.  Then I remembered: I don't smoke.  Suddenly the anxiety went away.  I'm not even sweating it now.  Non smokers don't smoke.  That's how I got rid of tonights urge, and that's how I know I won't have an issue Friday.  Nonsmokers don't smoke.

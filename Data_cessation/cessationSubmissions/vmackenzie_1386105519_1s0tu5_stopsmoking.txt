I quit!

I started "quitting" two weeks ago today. Last Saturday I cracked and bought a pack. Today I was fighting with myself because I wanted a cigarette out of habit, and I was already outside in the cold. So I lit up, even with my body and brain saying "I don't want this". 

It was awful. Feeling the smoke burn my mouth and lungs, tasting that rancid, putrid crap masked by the menthol, seeing the smoke and saying "that's going in my body! I'm willingly inhaling that!" I had three puffs and put it out. 

I get no "high" anymore from smoking. I just do it out of habit and addiction. I was four days clean on Saturday and I exchanged it for this. And it's just not worth it. 

Smoking in and of itself is illogical. There are lozenges, gum, patches, ecigs and other nicotine delivery systems that don't involve setting a piece of paper on fire and inhaling it. 

I've battled other "addictions", namely self injury, and I was able to beat that. So I can beat this too. I've finally reached the point where it's not beneficial. I mean, it was never beneficial but I'm at a point where I can tell nicotine to shove it. 

Gah. What was I thinking? 

Thanks to the community for the push to quit.

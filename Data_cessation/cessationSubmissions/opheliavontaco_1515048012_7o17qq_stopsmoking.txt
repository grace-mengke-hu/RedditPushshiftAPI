To all those who have successfully quit; what have you gained?

Im in the process of quitting right now and had found myself looking at all te things I’d miss and all the things I’d give up. I’ve recently changed my thinking into what I’m about to gain, and it’s the best motivation. So to anyone who’s quit, what did you gain, what improved and what other positive things came out of quitting smoking? What were some positives that you weren’t anticipating?

I didn't smoke cigarettes for over a year, but now i will also quit joints/blunts

I was really happy with my decision to quit smoking (cigarettes) on may 2017. 
But i just cannot justify myself as a non-smoker if i  continue smoking joints, even when i don't put tobacco in them, i am still smoking and inhaling the marijuana smoke, which is as unhealthy as tobacco smoke, because smoke is smoke. 

The final quit won't be hard for me. It's just that conscious decision i am making, that that's it. I will never take a puff of smoke again. In case i want to consume marijuana, i will use a vaporizer i bought. I made it this far, i just have to take this final step. 

Instead of smoking weed, i will concentrate much more on my Wing Chun training and also university, as well as spending more time with my family (especially my grandmother). 

I'm totally hyped for this final quit. Let's get it motherf**kers!!

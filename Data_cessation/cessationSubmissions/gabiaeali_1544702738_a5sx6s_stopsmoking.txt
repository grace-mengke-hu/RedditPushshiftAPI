5 days quit and losing weight. Here's how I do it

I started implementing lifestyle changes in baby steps. First I started doing cardio daily 2 months ago. 2 weeks later I began intermittent fasting and tracking my calories. I lost about 17 lbs before I quit last week. I have stuck to my calorie allowance and the 18 hour fasts and the weight is coming off on schedule. I came close to snacking before bed but just talked myself out of it.

Last time I quit I gained 20 lbs, but it was simple: I had replaced cigarettes with beer.

I nearly kept smoking out of fear of undoing my progress, but that just isn't happening. I changed my lifestyle little by little to get ready for this quit, and I'm not blowing it this time! If you are struggling with the fear of packing on the pounds,  try making changes in steps first, get your new habits in place, and you'll be prepared to kick smoking for good! Hope this helps.

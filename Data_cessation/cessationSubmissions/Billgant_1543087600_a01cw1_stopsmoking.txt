The Flu is your best route to quitting this winter

I got the flu in July and spent 4-5 days coughing and congested. I was so sick I didn't even think about smoking, and all the coughing and stuffiness took away any desire to smoke. On the sixth day I realized I hadn't smoked at all in six days, so I threw away my pack and decided to see how much longer I can go without smoking. It's been 4.5 months, and I haven't even taken a single puff. Also I have not used any kind of tobacco products in this time period.

So give it a try next time you get sick this season. It might work for you just like it did for me.

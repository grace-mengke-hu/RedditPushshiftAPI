Advice on how to break the habit.

Hey everyone! So I quit smoking cigarettes 3 years ago with the help of a vaporizer. It has really worked wonders. I started at 24 mg of nicotine in my juice and I am now down to 3 mg. I don't really get any nicotine cravings anymore but I am having a hard time stopping vaping just because of the habit. 

Any advice on how to break that? I don't know what I would do with myself without having something to do. Has anyone else experienced this?

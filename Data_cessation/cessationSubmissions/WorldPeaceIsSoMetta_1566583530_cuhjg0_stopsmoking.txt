5 weeks in- awful cravings, low focus, low verbal ability.

How normal is this? Reading most people feel better after about 2 weeks. I have a high pressure sales job so my verbal skills are critical and I feel I’ve lost an edge. How long is this going to last for?

Anyone been here before? Wasn’t a long term smoker but I was juuling almost a pod a day for about 5 months. 

Thanks!

I decided to quit smoking this week but things aren't going well for me

Okay so I've never been addicted to smoking but I'd smoke a cigarette occasionally when things were going rough for me. I realised it wasn't helping me deal with my problems so I decided to quit before I become a chainsmoker. I joined this sub this week and I've decided that this time I'm not gonna give in to the cravings and go back like every other time no matter how tempting it may be. But the day I smoked my last cigarette, I fell sick and I'm just getting worse with each passing day. My body temperature keeps rising, my chest feels like it's burning whenever I cough and I can barely speak. On top of that I feel like my legs have been crushed under a hydraulic press and my bowel movements seem to have hardwired. My mental state isn't doing great either as I feel I've lost the ability to feel any emotion at all. Is it normal to go through some kind of physical and/or mental imbalance or should I be worried?

I’m actually excited about getting a chest cold for the first time...

I can feel it coming on. 
I’m getting a chest cold.
I’m excited because maybe this means this time I can finally get a jump start on kicking this disgusting addiction.

Does anyone have any ideas for what could help me quit and stay quit?

I bought Allen Carr’s Easy Way book, and have been reading it. 

Anything else you guys know that can help me would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you!! 
I hope you’re all doing well!!

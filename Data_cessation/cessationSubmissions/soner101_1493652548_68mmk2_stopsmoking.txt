[serious] First day

I smoked for about 11 years. Today is my first day of becoming a non-smoker. I am also a recovering alcoholic. Ive been sober for 4years in july. Today is really rough. I can only go cold turkey. I can do little steps. Can i get some reassurance from Reddit. Maybe some facts that may make this a little easier mentally and emotionally.

Been lurking and I’m going to start this today. Advice please.

I’ve smoked on and off for 10 years. I’m a male almost 27 years old. Smoking is something I just haven’t been able to shake. I’m tired of being concerned about future health problems and tired of having a shitty sense of smell, worsening anxiety and depression and overall breathing struggles after smoking too much in a day.

I wanted to ask you guys a few questions though:

1. Did you find you had to quit hanging around certain people or places? Did you ever go back to them after you quit?

2. Do you REALLY feel a huge difference and after how long do you notice you feel that huge difference?

3. What did you do when you were craving a cigarette? 

This is a great subreddit and I look forward to your answers!!

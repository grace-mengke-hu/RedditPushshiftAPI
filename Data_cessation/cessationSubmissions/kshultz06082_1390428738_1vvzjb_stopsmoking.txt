Acupuncture or Hypnosis to quit?

Has anyone tried acupuncture to quit smoking? Did it work?

I have been smoking since I was 16. I will be 35 in 2 days. I have tried and failed to quit multiple times. Other than hypnosis and acupuncture, I have tried EVERYTHING... I can't use the patches because I have an allergic reaction. Gums and lozenges don't seem to help at all. Welbutrin made me insanely angry but did nothing to curb my smoking. Most recently, I tried Chantix. I became homicidal and suicidal, and I still smoked. Even e-cigs dont help because they dont feel or taste like a real cigarette, so I just go back to regular cigs. 

So, long story short, I need something to help me quit. I have no will-power. So, does acupuncture or hypnosis work?

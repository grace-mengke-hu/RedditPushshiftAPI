OH MY GOD I HAVE A STAR NOW!!! You guys are awesome!

Jesus, I can't believe I've made it this far. I hadn't realized it's been 38 DAYS!!!

So, I quit for the 10,000,000th time after Argentina lost the World Cup. My friends still smoke and I still hang out with them, but I so seldom get the craving for a cigarette nowadays. Now even they're starting to attempt quitting because they've seen me do it. We've all been smoking together for 5 years, so I think I may have become the inspiration.

There's little point to this thread, I just wanted to say that I'm super happy and thankful for all the supportive people on this sub! You guys are awesome!

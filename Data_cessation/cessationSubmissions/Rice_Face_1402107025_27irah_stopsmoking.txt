Help me endure this weekend

2 week ago today, I went 7 days without cigarettes. I gave in and smoked 1 last week and resetted my badge. Today, marks another week being smoke-free. These next few weekends will be full of triggers and I'm finding the strength to pull through.

**I AM STRONG!** I also want to remind each and every one of you to link arms (metaphorically) and support each other.

Found a cigarette under my driver seat and didn't smoke it

Long time lurker here and I have been vaping essential oils to help achieve the feeling of smoking without lighting up, and so far it has worked very well for me, when I get a craving, the vape really helps. Yesterday, I found a cigarette under my seat and I felt the intense craving and it took a lot of effort but I just threw it away. Thanks to the people and stories of r/stopsmoking for helping me on this journey.

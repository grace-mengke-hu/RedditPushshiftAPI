under huge stress, just need to tell someone who gets it

I quit last november and I've been successfully staying away. 

However today, just now, thoughts started to come in about having a stick and how good it would be, just me, my problems and cigarettes. 

NO! I've been down this blasted path before! It's initially fantastic to light up and feel all relaxed and cool but after a while I'll start feeling like shit. It'll become another problem on top of what I already have. 

1. I'm facing further debts

2. I have to plan a surprise proposal to my sweetheart without breaking my bank

3. I was let go on friday and now I'm serving my notice. I don't want to tell family until I can handle it myself. Evwn now I haven't sat down and thought about it fully yet. Been very busy with family.

All these situations feel overwhelming. Towering. I can't tell many people because I feel ashamed. However I will not pick up cigarettes again.

Thanks for listening guys.

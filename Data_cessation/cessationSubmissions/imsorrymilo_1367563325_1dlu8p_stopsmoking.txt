Let's try this again...

Hey y'all,
I'm back for more. Fed up, desperate, all the usual buzzwords. 
Here's my story:
Quit for seven months with Allen Carr, never felt better, didn't crave, etc etc. Told my friends and family and anyone who would listen really, that this was it, I was done, I will never smoke another cigarette for the rest of my life. And the sad part is, I really really believed it. Flash forward to this past February, and I'm in Central America on vacation, having the time of my life. Meet girl, fall for girl, girl smokes, persistent vacation-style partying, and I caved. Ok, I think, no big deal, I'll be a vacation smoker. Quit when I get back. I think we all know how that ended. Here I am, it's May, and I'm hopelessly addicted once again. I'm falling back on all the old habits that Easyway taught me are completely ridiculous (this is my last one, I'll just smoke when I drink, etc etc.) I'm listening to my addictive voice, and three or four half-hearted attempts later, I turn to you, the wonderful people of r/stopsmoking, once again. I feel like I've let you all down, and I've let myself down.
But I'm determined. This is it. I'm done.
I'm sure I'll be posting incessantly and asking for support; I just read the thread of people for whom Allen Carr hasn't worked, and that gave me some hope. I just don't want to smoke anymore. Wish me luck my friends. Any words of advice and/or encouragement are obviously appreciated. Thanks loves.

It starts today!

I did quit 22 Minutes ago, i will go cold turkey as i did the last time.
5 Month 15 days was it for the first half of the year now its going to be longer :)
The main cause this time is the fear over COPD since i cough more often now... i'm 28 years old and and do a good amount of sport.
I made a FEV test and the doc says its okay... so for now iam save i think.
12 years one pack per day... this aint going to be easy.

Iam not a native speaker so be kind :)

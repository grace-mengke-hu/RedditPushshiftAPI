13 days down - stop smoking app helps!

hey guys, I joined reddit on the advice of a stop smoking app which is really helpful.  It gives you missions each day to complete, which I guess, help reinforce a sense of achievement each day that passes without smoking.

I have to say I found week 1 easy, it was the beginning of week 2 that became hard for me.  But I didn't falter and each time I was tempted by the sight of someone smoking, I focused on how bad they smell and that helped deter me from joining them.

Reading everyone else's comments is really encouraging, makes the journey less lonesome.  Keep it up pls :-)

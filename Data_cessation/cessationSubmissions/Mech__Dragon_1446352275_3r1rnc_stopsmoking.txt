Day 11: Feels Like My Gut Is Fighting A War With Itself Using Knives.

It's day 11. My gut is incredibly sore and painfully today, as well releasing ungodly amounts of liquid shit, which has the piercing pain of a thousand knives upon my rectum as it passes to the porcelain telephone.

I suppose this is more of sympathy type of post, although how can one seek sympathy for which the pain was brought against *themselves* through 14 years of smoking. This bloating sucks. This pain sucks. And drinking last night probably wasn't the best idea (my gut symptoms started around Thursday evening, but I thought it would pass...mmmm so many puns ðŸ’©.). But I won 2 of 3 games of dominoes, and I didn't smoke!

I did a some searching on Google, and it appears that IBS symptoms show up in ex-smokers soon after quitting. There also seems to be a connection to NRTs that may prolong the issue. Ugh.

But I am quitting. I have cut this evenings NicoDerm patch in half in an effort to wean myself off nicotine a wee bit quicker than I had intended.

But for now I am going to go curl up in a ball as my intestines send out morse code garbles to the gods. This to shall pass.....lololo.

Here's to healthy futures.

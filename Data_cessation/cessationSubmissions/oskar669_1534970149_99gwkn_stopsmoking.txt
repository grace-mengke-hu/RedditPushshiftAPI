Accidentally quit smoking... trying to keep up

I'm 35, been smoking since I was 16. I smoke irregularly and fairly light self-rolling tabacco. Probably 5-10 a weekday and up to 20 on a weekend. I didn't smoke Sat-Monday for no particular reason, but when I realized, I made an effort to keep going. 

I'd quit purely for distant-future health reasons, which makes this hard. It's not too hard to distract myself... I just bought a ton of sugarfree candy today - but I also don't have a strong incentive to quit either. That's my brain bullshitting me I think. I'd save ~ â‚¬600 annually and obviously: not dying of some horrible cancer is also a plus. So I'm coming up on my 6th day, but since I had half a cigarette Monday night, I'll reset the count there.

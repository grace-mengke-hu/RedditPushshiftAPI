Im not interested in NRT because im quitting for clarity of mind.

Does anybody else feel this way? Ive been smoking and vaping for a couple years now, I was addicted to nicotine before I ever tried anything else and am in my mid twenties now. Ive been sober from everything for a couple years except nicotine. Its like I don't remember what life felt before nicotine and always feel like im in a fog. I finally want to be free of this chemical and have the clarity of mind that non smokers seem to have. It seems like such a foreign thing but I want to experience it.

How much damage did I just do.

Started to scale back 32 days ago, down to 1 pack every 3 days from 1 pack a day. Starting 7/22/15 and ending 7/24 working no stop on a project and went through 40 packs in roughly 50 hours.
Hit my house mates stash. Coughing like a bear, lower sides, gut and back painful, throat feels fine but wheezing in/out and can't take a deep breath. Dry cough, somewhat productive clear foamy fluid, no flecks, dark etc. Just wait it out or should I panic and head to A&E. Yes I know a super dumbass thing to do but didn't realize habit is a habit.

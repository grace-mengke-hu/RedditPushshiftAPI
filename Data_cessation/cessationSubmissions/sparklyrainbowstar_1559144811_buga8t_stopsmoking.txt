Day 8 of Chantix. Any advice?

Hi everyone. I have lurked around here for a while but wasn't sure I could quit. Finally went to a doctor and she prescribed me chantix. I'm on day 8 now, haven't had any mood changes or nightmares, but I noticed last night when I smoke a cig I get really nauseous. I'm still not sure what day I'm supposed to quit on. Has anyone here taken it and have any advice?

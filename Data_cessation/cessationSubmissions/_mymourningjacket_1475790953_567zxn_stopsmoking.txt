69 days smoke freeeee

I feel like smoking is no longer a part of my identity now, and that's huge. My boyfriend still smokes, but he smokes nasty cigarettes (Timeless Times) and they smell horrible to me, so they haven't even been tempting. I have noticed huge improvements in my running and just my breathing in general. I feel amazing when I wake up in the mornings. I am so grateful to have quit, and I will remain vigilant about NOPE. Not one puff ever.

Thank you guys so much

Okay I’m an actor and I’m on day 5 of quitting. I have an audition today and I almost lost it this morning in terms of smoking. I was full of so much rage. I did yoga. I mediated. I ate half a box of altoids. I cried. I really was about to give in and have “just one.” 

But then I remembered this video I saw posted here: https://youtu.be/xeRhOsUGM54

I watched it while forcing myself to clean up a bit before my audition. I’m so grateful I didn’t give in but jesus I was close. Thank you guys!

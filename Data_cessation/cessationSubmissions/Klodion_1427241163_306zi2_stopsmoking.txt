Dreamed I Was Smoking

Last night I had a dream that I was walking out of the train station in my hometown on route to my house, like I'd normally be. No idea why, but in my dream I pulled out a pack of cigs and lit one up. I took one dream-puff before dream-me stood there and thought 'Um, what?' and threw the damn cig on the floor. 

I really think that my subconscious mind is beginning to realise that I'm not a smoker anymore, the fact that I actually dreamed of throwing that cigarette down on the floor is extremely awesome to me.

Keep it going guys, we've got this!

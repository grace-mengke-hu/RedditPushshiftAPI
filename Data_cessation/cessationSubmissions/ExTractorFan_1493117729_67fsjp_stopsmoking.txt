I dreamed I smoked

I had a dream the other night in which I was smoking. It didn't feel particularly good, but it felt "normal". I woke up the next morning feeling like shit: I'd smoked, and undone more than a thousand days of good work.

Then I woke up fully and realized that it was just a terrible dream.

This is the first dream I had since stopping smoking this time, and it's significant because all the times I tried to give up before, I used to dream I was smoking and I'd felt disappointed when I woke up because I *hadn't* had a cigarette. 

Nicotine is a wily bastard.

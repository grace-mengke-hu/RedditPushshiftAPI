A long battle

Need a bit of advice which I am almost sure is going to end in "You need to see a doctor about that"

Anyway, I am in my 40's and have smoked most of the time since my teens. I have tried everything - vape, CT, books, been hypnotised, needles stuck in me, gum, you name it. At least 2x a year I give up for days, weeks or months, but I always, always start again after 3-4 months because, well, mental issues.

Quite soon after giving up smoking, say 2-3 weeks, I start visualising violence - against people I know and myself. It scares me to death. I start hiding things, like money, around the house and I am self rationalising in completely weird ways. I have trouble "beating the demons" in my mind to stay engaged at work or at home. I cannot sleep. 

I smoke and I am back to normal within a day.

I have no history of mental health issues or even behaving oddly - I am a normal person and part of my work and community. I have a responsible job with significant management responsibility and am paid well.

Cigarettes are my curse and my cure. Has anyone else faced anything like this?

Throwaway for obvs.

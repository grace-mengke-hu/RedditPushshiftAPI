Decided to quit because my car was stolen.

Car was stolen last week, while shopping around I realized my monthly payments on a new car were close to what I spend per month on smokes.
So basically, cigarettes or a new car.
The reason I'm sharing this, is I've though about quitting before, the money I'd save, etc. but would blow it off.
Now I have something I want to spend money on more than cigs, big motivator. 24 hours so far.

edit: have passed 72 hours.

Long-term effects of short-term heavy smoking?

Hi all, for the last ten years or so, I've been an very light smoker: something around 2-5 packs a year. However, this past year has been extremely stressful for me, and from May to Mid-July I smoked about half a pack of cigarettes a day. I've since switched to vaping, and I'm planning on titrating myself off of nicotine over the next few months. 

I was curious as to what the timeline back to normalcy looked like for me--and also to see how badly I'd fucked myself--but none of the articles I've read address the amount of cigarettes smoked or the length of time spent smoking. Can anyone point me in the direction of an article discussing the differences in health as between a light smoker and a heavy smoker? Also, are there any differences between smoking heavily for ~six months like I did vs. smoking heavily for a longer period of time? Will it actually take me 15 years to be back to a non-smoking level  of risk? 

Thanks for any help.

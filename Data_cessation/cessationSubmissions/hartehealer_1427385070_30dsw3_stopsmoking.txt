Cigarette Smell (Day3)

Confession: The smell of cigarette smoke has never smelled unappealing to me. And the child care provider at my work smokes. She went out just awhile ago for a cig and then she came to ask me a few questions about payment processing and I could smell it on her and it honestly smelled nice to me.

This isn't to say that I'm willing to go out and buy a new pack, even if a small craving is now working its way through me, but I don't know if I'll stop finding the smell appealing after awhile? (I liked the smell as a child as well).

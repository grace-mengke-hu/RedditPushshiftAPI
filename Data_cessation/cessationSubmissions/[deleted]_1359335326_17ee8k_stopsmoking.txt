Enough dicking around! Day one.

Been subscribed to this subreddit for ages. Time to actually make an actual start to this. One question, though: Live in the Philippines, where it's cheap as fuck to buy cigarettes. So those quit calculator things aren't so impressive. Looking for a desktop app which has health benefits etc as you progress. Any help?

Question for People who have quit and relapsed: How does that cigarette feel?

Hello! Currently I am on day 10 of quitting. I stopped cold turkey after the sea hawks won the super bowl.

Feeling great! Loving the smells and tastes that come back after a few days.

I was talking about how I miss smoking and it's not really me that misses it it's just that false voice (nicotine addicted brain) telling me I do. I then ask my roommate who had quit for a few months if smoking a cigarette is as pleasurable as I remember. If I relapse will I be disappointed in the quality of my false high. I know I will feel crazy guilt towards my will power which Is why I am not relapsing: Ever. But I was curious as someone who tried and failed how was going back to smoking.

His answer was: "It's better than you remember. That's what hooks you. Don't smoke again."

My Question is this:

* Did you relapse and was the smoke a better feeling then you remember?

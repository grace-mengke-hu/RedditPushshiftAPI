How harmful is vaping an e-cigarette once or twice a month?

I smoked for about a year when I was 20.  I’m 25 now and have been vaping an ecig casually at a buddy’s house on a night or two a month.  Never more than that and I never do it during the week.  I’m looking to not do that anymore though because it’s pretty pointless.  What kind of damage have I done to my body after a year of smoking and a little bit of vaping?

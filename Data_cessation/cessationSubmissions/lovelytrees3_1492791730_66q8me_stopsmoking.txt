Unintentionally smoked a spliff last night! Reset badge?

Good morning all,

In honor of 4/20 yesterday, I took a hit of (what I thought was) just a joint. I found out after two hits that it was a SPLIFF (joint rolled with a little tobacco in it)!!!! I didn't have very much, and it didn't derail my progress. If anything, it did the complete opposite! 
In your opinion, does that count as a "cheat", even if I didn't know about the tobacco beforehand? 

HELP ME ABSOLVE MY GUILT.  Happy Friday all. :-)

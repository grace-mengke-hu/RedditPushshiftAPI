I just saw that it is 100 days...

I am getting by, I still don't feel any better, however, I am not drinking near as much anymore so that's a good thing.

I bought one of those e Hookahs for when I'm driving and get an urge. It just sits in the armrest, they work pretty good and there is 0mg of Nicotine in it. Just a habit thing. Usually I can get by without it, but the last week it was really bad for some reason.

keep on chuggin!

What is the dumbest rationalization you have used?

What is the dumbest rationalization that got you back on Cigs?

Last year I had been smoke free for a whole month.  I decided to go on a wilderness survival trip in northern Minnesota.  I bought a pack because I told myself "Well, I suppose I could die up there, might as well die smoking."   That snowballed into full-fledged smoking again.

What is yours?

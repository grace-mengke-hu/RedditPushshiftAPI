[f23] Just smoked my last cigarette.

I feel rather idiotic for posting here already considering I just "quit" like 30 mins ago and my last cigarette wasn't even planned. I have been a smoker for 7 years now and hated it more with each passing year. I've quit before and stayed clean for 6 months until I screwed up. Those 6 months (okay, minus a few tough weeks in the beginning) were GREAT, I loved being free. I still can't believe I managed to fuck this up. Anyway. Ever since then I'd occasionally hear this little voice in my head saying "you can quit again, you have done it before, you still remember how much better you felt, just do it NOW, all you need to do is to NOT LIGHT ANOTHER ONE". I still couldn't bring myself to quit, until today, apparently. I had another one of those moments half an hour ago and for some reason it was different this time. I just embraced it, soaked my remaining cigarettes in cooking oil and threw them out. I have no idea where this sentiment was coming from but I guess it was long overdue. I know the next days will be miserable and theoretically this is the worst time I could have picked since the the next weeks are going to be extra stressful for me due to work/university stuff coming up. Whatever. BRING IT ON!

Campfire Cravings

I was at a wonderful bbq last night and people were rolling their own cigarettes.  I haven't had a craving as bad since.  There's always something pretty nice about a campfire.  I enjoyed it and spent some time using my clean(er) lungs in order to fuel the warmth. Cravings past in seconds. I didn't realize it until today that at some point last night the strongest craving for a cig I've had since I've quit this time had passed without me knowing.   I'm pretty grateful and just wanted to share a win.

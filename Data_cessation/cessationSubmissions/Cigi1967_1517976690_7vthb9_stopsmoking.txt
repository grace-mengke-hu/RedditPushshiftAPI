Acid reflux or indigestion

Any one out there have this issue???  I have never in my life had this problem. It started when I quit 10 months ago. It’s improved a bit but not a lot. I have gained a little weight but that wouldn’t be the issue from the beginning. Did I mask this by smoking all these years?  Any stories out there or advice?

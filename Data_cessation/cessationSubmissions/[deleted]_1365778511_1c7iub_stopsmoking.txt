So glad I found this subreddit

Today is day one off cigarettes but I have a can of dip in my pocket. I was thinking once I switched to dip for a few days I could taper off that easier than just cold turkey which turns me into an asshole. I am scared, like surprisingly really scared. I am a recovering drug addict and haven't touched a drug or drink in almost 3 years and the thought of this is way scarier. I'm gonna do it though, I'm ready this time.

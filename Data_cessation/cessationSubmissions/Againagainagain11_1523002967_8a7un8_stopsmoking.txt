Checking in on day 79

Hi everyone,

After smoking 10-20 cigarettes per day for 11 years I quit on January 18. I had tried to quit many times before. I used to throw out my cigarette pack, then panic and buy another a few hours later. I even smoked butts. I spent money on cigarettes that I should have spent on other things.

And now I am finished with all that.

I used a vape for one month, starting at 6mg/ml and going down to 3mg/ml. When it broke, I didn't bother to replace it. That was February 17.

My life keeps getting better since I quit.

Please everyone if you want to quit, keep trying. Never give up!

9 days smoke free but the urge is bad

Like for some reason, I've had a relatively okay time quitting. But today after being a whole 9 days smoke free the urge to smoke is just really powerful and I find myself consistently arguing with myself in my head to go smoke. What helped you guys get through days like this?

I'm holding out I won't smoke today but my brain just feels like it's on fire and I'm exhausted...

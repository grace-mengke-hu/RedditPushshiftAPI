Day 5. Nightmares.

Just woke up on day 5. I have always been prone to very vivid and often horrifying dreams but the dreams I have been having the last few nights have been so fucked up I almost want to start smoking just to avoid them tomorrow night. In the immortal words of Winston Zeddemore, I've seen shit that will turn you white. Having quit a few times unsuccessfully I know this is common (at least for me.) Any tips on how to prevent dreaming? Alcohol usually does the trick but I'm avoiding drinking until I have a few weeks under my belt smoke free.

3 days.. 3 weeks.. 8 months.. Not sure what applies.

Ok so I guess you're wondering about my title. I decided to cheat with quitting smoking, but all the while having every intention to quit eventually.

About 9 months ago I bought myself a Â£50 cloud machine and some Heisenberg e-liquid, best thing I ever did. My brother got me in to mixing my own liquid of which I could control the amount of nicotine I was vaping, second best thing.

Fast forward about 8 months, I slowly reduced the amount of nicotine in my liquids to zero. For 3 weeks I vaped zero nicotine then told myself this was my last bottle of liquid, I'm done vaping!

I'm now 3 days in to no vape/no cigarettes and it is so much easier. I'll admit, the first day was hard, wondering what to do with my hands when I usually reached for my vape but nothing a couple of deep breaths doesn't sort, because when you were on zero nicotine thats basically all you're doing!

Recommend the vape route to anyone after my experience but don't treat it as a substitute, plan to quit, get rid of the drug (nicotine) then get rid of the habit. Good luck.

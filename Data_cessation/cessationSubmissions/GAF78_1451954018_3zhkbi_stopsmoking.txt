After 26 days of NRT, looks like I'm going nicotine free...

I smoked my last cigarette 27 days ago.  For the first day, I didn't use any nicotine replacement.  (I was sick, so it was easy.)  The second day, I wore a patch.  Ever since the third day, I've been using a vaporizer.  It has a lower level of nic than I was used to and I was only using it a little bit.  The last few days, I haven't thought about it nearly as much until night time, though I did take a few pulls on it during the day.  Today I didn't grab it before I left for work.  It crossed my mind a couple of times, especially after lunch, but it wasn't a strong craving and I just shrugged it off.  Now it's 6:30 p.m. and I haven't had any nicotine today.  I guess I'll just go for it and try not to use the vape again.  It's been a good 4 weeks of not having to deal with cigarettes and I feel amazing, but I'm ready to be totally free of the nicotine so I don't have to think about it at all.  I know that won't happen until I get rid of the vape.

Day 3

Strong cravings today. A little bit of throwing up. I think I have to ditch the Nicotine gum and go for regular gum instead, too bad because I have a lot. I felt like caving in today and having 1, and I was of the mentality of just 1 for a while today, but it passed, and it gave me more resolve anyway. I knew I could easily ignore 1 cigarette than I could a few days ago.

Quitting smoking in the US

So i live in lebanon after having lived a decent part of my adult life in the us. I have had the habjt of smoking here and thereever since i was 14 and lived in lebanon. When i was in college, in the US, i barely ever smoked. I moved back after graduation 3 years ago and lebanon is smokers heaven. I went from the social smoker to over a pack a day. Tried quitting a few times, never had issues with cravings or whatever, but fell off the wagon just because... Not taking the issue tio seriously i guess. 

Anyway, i cane to the states this week (tuesday) and decided not to smoke when im here. And boy is it easy. A lot of people dont smoke, you cant smoke anywhere you want, and since there are few smokers if you light up you will reek all day. 4 days now and nit a singke craving. So to all us quitters, i hope you realize how privileged you are abd that yiur battle is less steep.

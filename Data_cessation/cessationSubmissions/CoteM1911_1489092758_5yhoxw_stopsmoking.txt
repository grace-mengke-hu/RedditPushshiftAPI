I cheated...kind of?

I think I'm 25 days today. I've been posting and complaining like a baby pretty often. This last week has been honestly one of the most nerve-wracking, stressful and scary times I've ever had in my entire life. My nerves and anxiety are at all time highs I never even know it could go to. Needless to say the cravings have been horrible. I've been patch free for a little over two weeks but yesterday I had a moment. I justified why I should have a cigarette in every way shape and form I could think of. The ONLY thing that stopped me from it was I knew how much it would taste like shit and it would ruin every feeling I was after. I went home for lunch and said fuck it and threw half a 14mg patch on. Within minutes I felt relief. My stress levels dropped way down. 
I left it on for a few hours and ripped it off. Thus far today, major chaos again- but not like yesterday. No need for a fix today. 

What I'm confused about is everyone says smoking doesn't relieve stress. Maybe SMOKING doesn't but nicotine sure does. What's the difference between popping a Xanax or other prescribed meds vs. a piece of nicotine gum/patch? They're both depressants and essentially do the same thing when it comes to stress relief. Thoughts?

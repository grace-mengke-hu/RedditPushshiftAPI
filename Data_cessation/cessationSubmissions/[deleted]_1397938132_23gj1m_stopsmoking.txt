I think I was in better shape before I quit smoking...

So, at the urging of some of my rugby teammates, combined with some personal reasons, I quit smoking in January. Other than 1 drunken smoke in February, I've been doing well.  
  
However, there's the weight.  
  
I've gained somewhere around 25 lbs since I quit smoking. 25 lbs in 4 months. Last season, when I was smoking, I could keep up with a rugby match fairly well, and in spite of being tired, I never really struggled to get into the game.  
  
This season, in spite of the fact that I am no longer a pack a day smoker, I can't seem to do much of anything without getting so winded I struggle to catch my breath.  
  
I know a large part of this is the weight, but has this happened to anyone else? Any suggestions (besides 'work out more')?

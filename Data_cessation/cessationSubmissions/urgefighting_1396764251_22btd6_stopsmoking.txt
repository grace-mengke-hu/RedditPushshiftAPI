Two weeks+

I told myself I wouldn't write a post until I had a 2 week badge, but smoking has been out of my mind so much, that I missed the date by a couple of days.

My badge should say a month, but about three weeks ago I had a terrible day that left me in tears as I drove across the state. I stopped to get gas and bought a pack. This drove me back into the addiction and I smoked every day for a week. On the seventh day, I re-affirmed my decision to stop and I threw out half a pack and haven't touched one since.

I have been fighting depression for the last couple of years and every time I quit I start up again whenever I feel down. But now, I realize that depressed and cigarette-free is better than depressed and nicotine-addicted.

Like many here, I can attest that I quit with the help of the book Easy Way by Allen Carr. Reading the book didn't make me quit, it gave me the tools I needed to quit on my own and I owe it my life. I breathe better, I smell better (so does my car) and the weight of being a slave to that awful drug has been lifted. I wish the same to everyone that visits here looking for support and direction.

One thing I've done is to recognize my moments of weakness. I stopped smoking weed and I haven't had a drink in the last two weeks. I know those moments compromise my ability to refuse a cigarette, so I avoid them. Not having a cigarette is more important than getting drunk with my friends.

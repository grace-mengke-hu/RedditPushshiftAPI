Post your silly/playful/fun motivations

We all talk about the health, money, social, etc. Benefits of our quit process, but I think we should also take some time to make it fun and talk about our less serious, more playful and fun motivations to quit for good. 

Mine is I want to get my throat back to retake singing death growls and gutural vocals like before!

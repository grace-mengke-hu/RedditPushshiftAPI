I want to blow up the world!

Not even 24 hours into my (final) attempt to quit. I have to do this for my daughter, myself as well, but overall so I can be there for my daughter. People keep telling me to be strong for her, but I fear she is getting all my frustration directed at her. I am using an e-cig to..help I guess...no nicotine in it. I want to blow up the world and cry while I do it. My anxiety level is insane and I feel my head is going to explode. I am determined. I think I should throw this full pack and pack with 4 cigs left away but the very thought makes me want to cry. This is just a rant. This is just me going insane. After all is said and done....I will be proud of myself. Right now, however, I hate myself for taking away the one thing that calms me. :(*Edit* 10 days so far and I am finally to the point where my first thoughts after everything isn't, "I need a cigarette" >_< I am less cranky, which is nice. Food tastes better. I am handling my triggers better. Gum really helped me a lot. I am excited and so proud that I made it this far. Willpower is an amazing thing.

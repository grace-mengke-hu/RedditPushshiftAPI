I had the weirdest dream

Ok, so I'm at 43 days and still going strong. So happy I have finally quit smoking after all those years poisonning myself and loved ones. (Between 1 and 2 packs per day for a bit over 10 years.)

I've said it before, but I have actually found the experience to be *much* easier than I expected. For me, 75% of the battle was to actually decide to quit. I was mostly *afraid of failing*, I suppose, and there probably was over a year between my first thoughts of quitting and actually doing it. But now that it's done, I can't say it's been that hard. The cravings are... I'm not even sure I can call them cravings, really. No patches, no gum, no vape. No mood swings, either. It's like.. I'm really done with that crap.

Last week has been horrible on a personal level. Almost went through a break-up (relation of over 8 years), work is hectic, coworkers fuel on ridiculous high-school drama, I don't really have any time for myself, etc. There were 2 evenings this week where I can say I truly felt like giving up. Tuesday and wednesday were hell. 

*"Fuck it, I need to smoke a hundred smokes right now"* is all that raced through my mind, with occasional *"Nah, don't screw it up, you're just trying to sabotage yourself and that's dumb. You don't* **want** *to smoke, you want to give your brain some quick dopamine release through a rush of poison. Your brain is dumb."*

Things kind of settled, dust fell and life is already almost "back to normal". I guess all of this builds up to the dream I had last night.

**TL;DR start here**

Last night, I dreamt I bought a pack of cigarettes, opened it and lit one right up. In my dream, I was self-conscious and it felt like I was failing, like I was giving up. That dream-cigarette tasted good yet it made me feel completely awful. I woke up to that dreadful feeling, and it was only when I finished my first cup of coffee and passed the usual *"Nope, post-coffee cigarettes are not a thing anymore."* that it finally faded away.

Anyone else have "ex-smoker" dreams? I hated it and really hope it won't happen again.

(With all that said, yes, 43 days and feeling great! :D)

Quitting has fucked my head up.

I stopped smoking on December 18th at 1330 est. During and around that time, I started back on keto and began training to run. I also have a personal and family history of mental illness. Just so you can't say I left anything out.


I called my wedding off. I have no energy and little interest in running anymore. I'm supposed to be dancing in a competition at the beginning of April, I'm so anxious and self conscious that I can't bring myself to practice. My sex drive has disappeared. I am emotionally detached. Nothing is cute or romantic anymore. I've found it easy to fall back into self injury. I sometimes wish I would die.


I'm not really sure what to do with all of this. My doctor upped my Wellbutrin to 100 mg twice a day and said this would help my sex drive and the depression would fade.


My boyfriend thinks we're just settling into the relationship; but if this is normal, I might as well go ahead and kill myself anyway as there's no point in having us both miserable. 


Background: 25, female, started smoking at 14 years old.


**Edit: talking with boyfriend now, asked my mom which psychiatrist she saw, and I'm searching for psychologists with odd hours. Thank you for your input.**


**I'd love to know, those of you that are healed completely, how long it took you to trudge through this shit.**


**Edit 2: had a really great talk with boyfriend last night about what was going on, he was incredibly supportive. I've got an appointment to see a psychiatrist in two weeks, I'm going to get a recommendation for a therapist from him/her. Thank you so much for your help and encouragement, I'm feeling incredibly optimistic!**

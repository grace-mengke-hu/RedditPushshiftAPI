Today is the day.

Stopped smoking for 30 days. Went to Amsterdam for a 4 year anniversary present with my partner. Ended up smoking a box of cigarettes a day whilst over there (due to being incredibly high). Got back yesterday and tomorrow is the day that i'm going to start again. So 13/08/2016 will be the day that I stop smoking for good. I *really* believe it this time.

Day 3 and struggling

So whilst I don’t think I’m actually going to smoke I’m really struggling today. Day one was easy, and I thought I’d cracked it, but it has gotten progressively harder since then. The biggest down side so far is pretty bad exhaustion, which I wasn’t really prepared for. 

I keep forgetting too, so in the moments I usually would smoke I am feeling pretty disappointed when I remember I’ve quit. Dramatic I know but it kind of feels like I have nothing to look forward to now.

I had even planned smoking secretly tomorrow when everyone is out the house, although I’m pretty sure I won’t.

But yeah, it’s just getting harder and harder so far, so any words of encouragement would be amazing!

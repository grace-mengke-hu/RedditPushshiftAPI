Extreme disorientation/dissociation after quitting please help!

I’m on day 9 of quitting the disorientation and dissociation started on day 5 and it’s extremely bad! I literally can’t do anything I had to use my sick days at work because I’m completely messed up. I can’t even walk or drive how long is this going to last? I have my doctors appointment for Monday...

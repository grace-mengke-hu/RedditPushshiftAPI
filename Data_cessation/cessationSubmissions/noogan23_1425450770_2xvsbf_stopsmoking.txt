Tips on quitting

Hi all. Im 19 and have been smoking for about 2 years. I have tried cold turkey and moderating. I'd rather not do medication and vapes dont seem to do the trick. Ive even dried switching to dip or chewing tobacco but i still crave cigarettes. How do you people do it? Any tips for effective ways to quit?

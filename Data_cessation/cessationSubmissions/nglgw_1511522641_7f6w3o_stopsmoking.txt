Day 6. Fail.

Today was day 6 of my [latest] attempt to quit, and I was doing well. And then I ruined it.

My husband is out, my daughter is in bed, and I went to visit my Mum (who lives in a granny flat in our backyard). She’s a smoker, and I knew , even before before I had the conscious thought, that I was going to have a cigarette with her.

It tasted like shit. Instant regret, but what does it matter? I feel like shit, both mentally and physically. I can feel all the health anxiety that had slowly eroded over the past 6 days, come flooding back.

I’m just disappointed. I should be able to do this. I hate that I cave in the smallest moment of weakness. I have all the motivation in the world - fear of illness, expense, my two year old daughter - that still isn’t enough for me.

Thanks for listening, it helps to get this out. Back on the wagon tomorrow...

I kind of hate myself

I’m at work and realized my vape tank is empty and I left two bottles of juice at home. I either suck it up for the rest of the day (6-7 hours) or I go out and buy a pack of smokes because they’re cheaper than a whole new bottle of juice.

I hate that I feel immediately angry and panicked about not having the stupid juice. I hate that nicotine has basically ruled my life since I was 15, barring a 1-year smoke free stint in my mid twenties. 

I hate that all I want to do is sit in my house and stare at my phone and vape all fucking day, because I’m lazy and because the constant intake of nicotine makes me feel tired and shitty. 

I recently kicked alcohol six months ago and I’m feeling good about that, but I honestly think the smoke is ten times harder to kick and I hate myself for being so obsessed with it. 

I am surrounded by one nicotine cloud or another at all times of the day, every single day. 

I want to quit completely and I’m also afraid quitting the vape/smoke will hurt my chances of staying sober from alcohol because when I quit for a year I drank three times as much. 

My three biggest addictions are nicotine, alcohol, and my stupid phone. 

I feel weak and dumb. :(

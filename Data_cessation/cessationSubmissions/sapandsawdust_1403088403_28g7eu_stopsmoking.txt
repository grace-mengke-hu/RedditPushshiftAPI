End of Day Five - some questions

Hey everyone!

So I've posted in here before on my previous quit attempts, which failed. I'm determined to make this one last!

Last time I managed twelve days, but it was exam season and I'd just had a tooth extraction, yadda yadda. 

Day Five this time around feels really different from Day Five last time. I started off feeling really positive this time and have been finding each day just a little bit harder than the last.

My lungs have been clearing and my breathing has already been better, especially during physical activity. It's awesome. 

But it's really taking a psychological toll on me. It's aggravating my anxiety disorder, and I vomited this morning. I'm on the patch, so I'm not sure if I need to be worried or not. ETA: I'm not on medication for anxiety.

Basically just wondering if anyone can please tell me when it gets easier mentally/mood-wise, and if I should maybe go to the doctor about the vomiting? Internet tells me that it's a pretty common side effect.

Thanks for reading! :D

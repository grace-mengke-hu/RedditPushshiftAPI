14 days in and insanely bloated

Not just slighly bloated, but “wow are you pregnant?” kind of bloated, and it actually hurts quite a lot and it looks awful (thank god for baggy sweaters).

I never had any problems when I was still smoking, always, every morning after waking up. Now, nothing. I know I am lactose intolerant, but I rarely eat anything containing lactose anyways so that can not be the issue either. I drink plenty coffee, and I eat a pretty okay diet.

Is being bloated this badly all part of quitting smoking and it is simply my body adjusting, or should I start looking in to my diet? 

Looking for some tips and experiences! :) 

(And I just wanted to say I am so thankful for this sub, it is helping me out so much).

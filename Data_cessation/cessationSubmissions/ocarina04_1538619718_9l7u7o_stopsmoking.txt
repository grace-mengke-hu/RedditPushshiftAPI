Feels like a breakthrough

I’m six months in. I’ve been through a lot of shit in that time - breakup (x2, same person), moving, family illness. Not smoking through all that hasn’t been horrible, but it hasn’t been easy. Stress still triggered cravings for me. 

Today it felt like I had a breakthrough. I watched someone light up, and instead of trying to ignore it, I thought about what it would be like to light my own. For the first time since quitting, my immediate gut reaction wasn’t “Man, that would calm me down, I miss that,” it was “That would feel so gross in my mouth. It would coat my mouth and teeth in residue, it would feel heavy and sticky. And the smell would stick to my hair and clothes and fingers, and then I’d be covered in that smell for days. Gross.”

It seems simple, and even obvious, but I haven’t felt this way before. Sure, I’d TELL myself these things. I know these things logically, but my first, honest feeling about smoking has always been yearning up to this point. Feels good to have my feelings catch up to the rest of me.

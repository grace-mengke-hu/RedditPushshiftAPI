Back again!

Did a great job of quitting last year... for, like, 3 months! Been smoking again since last summer. 
Anyhoo, I go on the patch tomorrow. Hoping to deal with this addiction one step at a time. First, break the habit. Then tackle the actual nicotine addiction. Iâ€™m planning on using nicotine patch and cbd vape. 

Wish me luck!

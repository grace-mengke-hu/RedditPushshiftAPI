Lightheaded?

I've gone about a week without cigarettes now, the longest in a while. and a couple days ago I started feeling lightheaded all the time.

I checked my blood pressure, and while it has gone down slightly, it's not below normal or anything. 

Is the lightheadedness common? Was this the case for anyone else?

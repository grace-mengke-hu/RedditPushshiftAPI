I just need a bit of encouragement today

It's been a lot easier than I thought, quitting. The cravings are mild, I'm taking medication and it's pretty effective. I also made sure not to have any money when I'm alone and it's easy to give in and buy a pack. 

But the last two days have been hell on earth in my personal life. And unfortunately adult life keeps going and I couldn't help carrying money today. Yesterday the cravings were harder, but there simply wasn't any way to smoke. Today is just as shitty a day, my life is falling apart, everything I worked for is on the brink of collapse, can't really stop the crying fits every hour or so, etc. But today I can easily get a pack of cigarettes whenever I want to.

I need to remind myself that the cigarette is not gonna make me feel better. Not smoking is pretty much the only thing I got going for me right now and if I smoke I'll just feel even more of a failure.

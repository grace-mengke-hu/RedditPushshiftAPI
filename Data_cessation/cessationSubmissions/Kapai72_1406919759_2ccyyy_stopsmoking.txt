Quit for good, not just for now.

I really enjoy this subreddit, and all of the positivity and encouragement that can be found here.  Even 2+ years after quitting, I still appreciate the encouragement and advice.  While the cravings mostly disappear, they don't seem to every totally go away.

With that said, I would like to speak my mind about "quitting".  I am pretty tired of people using the term "quitting" when they only have stopped for a week, or a day, or a month, or whatever, only to go back to smoking again.

A friend of mine said yesterday "everytime I quit I get sick, it makes it really hard to quit".  

My thought was, why don't you just actually quit for real, and then you won't have to get sick anymore from quitting over and over.

It bothers me because I want to see people I care about quit smoking for real, and I feel that alot of people trick themselves into thinking they aren't smokers because "I can quit whenever I want to".  

Personally, I feel mentality is the most important factor of quitting, and I really don't like seeing people trick themselves into continuing smoking.

Anyways, I am very happy for all the people here who have begun the journey, you are doing a wonderful thing!!  But please try to view quitting as quitting for good, not quitting for now..

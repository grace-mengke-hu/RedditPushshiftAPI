I just need to vent

I'm travelling right now and have nobody to vent to so here I go....

I quit April 17th and went through some tough times...it's really hard to quit this. Smoking is my automatic response to stressful situations. I did really well to begin with and thought I'd beaten it 

Six weeks smoke free and I was enjoying my long holiday/vacation. I was in Cambodia. I was in the gym and running every morning. Going well. I met a nice girl. She told me she was pregnant. Even sent me photo evidence of a pregnancy test. I have never felt stress like it. My body and brain was screaming for a smoke.Went and got drunk and spent three days smoking. It transpires she made the whole thing up. Got a pregnant friend to piss in a bottle for up. Moved on from this and quit again.

Today, another six weeks on from this. Get a email from PayPal saying my account has been hacked. Not a big problem. But getting a Sim in Thailand and toping it up and finding a overseas contact number and actually finding a real life person to speak to had taken me all fucking day and a lot of money. I will never use PayPal ever again. And again the stress response was to buy a packet of cigarettes. Just smoked two and I don't intend to throw the rest how I'm feeling right now.

How the hell do people have the mental strength to get through life's challenges and not cave in,? This is after three months. What's wrong with me? I'm frustrated as I've read it takes three months for the dopamine to rebalance itself. Which will put me back to day one again tomorrow....This is destroying me..

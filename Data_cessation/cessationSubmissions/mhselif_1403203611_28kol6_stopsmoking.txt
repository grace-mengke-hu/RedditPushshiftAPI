D= Missed my 100 days

After quitting I was keeping track of my 1 week,2 week and 1 month quit time but after about 2 months I just forgot what day I was on and missed my 100 days by 6 days =(, i was going to do something awesome for myself for staying quit but since I forgot I never planned anything. Anyone have suggestion on things too do?

2 weeks of 21mg patch, dropping to 14 mg tomorrow...

I quit vaping 2 weeks ago and went on the patch.  I am wearing the last of my 14 day supply of 21mg patches and have a pack of 14mg patches on deck.  I am still having some pretty significant cravings and am feeling apprehensive about dropping my level. The instructions say to stay on the 21mg dose for many weeks.  Should I pick up another round of 21mg patches or just take the plunge to 14mg tomorrow?

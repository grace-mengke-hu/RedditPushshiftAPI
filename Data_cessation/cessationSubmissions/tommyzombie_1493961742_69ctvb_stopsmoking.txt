Tips for cold turkey? ~2 packs/day

Thanks already if you share some advice. 

13 years now at ~2 packs a day. I know its hard to fight addiction (alcohol), i accept that quitting smoking may be a perpetual fight, i know 'just one' means many more.

I composed a long winded thing but it was stupid.
 So i deleted it. Basically Im scared that i wont recognize myself without this coping mechanism.

Anyone felt that way?

3 Days Down

I woke up Wednesday morning, walked to the back porch to smoke my morning cigarette.  I took a drag, coughed and... put it out.  I don't know what flipped in my brain.  I've been smoking 1-2 packs a day for 20+ years and attempted to quit no less than 10 times.  Maybe it is age and a recognition that this can't continue if I want to see my kids finish college and, hopefully, attend their weddings.  With the help of lozenges, day 1 and 2 were tolerable.  Today was awful but I made it through it. My wife has accepted that she will have a really, really grumpy dude for a few days and has been supportive.  This is hard.  Really hard.  But... I've made it 3 whole days.  It will stay this way.  Maybe I'm rambling but I don't care.  I'm going to beat this shit once and for all....

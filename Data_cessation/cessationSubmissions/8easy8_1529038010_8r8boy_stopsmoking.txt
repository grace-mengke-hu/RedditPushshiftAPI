I went 2 months without a cigarette and then... then I went to Vegas last weekend.

I smoked far less than previous Vegas trips but still smoked a pack and a half.  I'm really disappointed in myself and dread starting over.  Any suggestions on quickly getting myself back on track?  I've smoked at least 5 cigarettes a day since my return Monday and I feel like I am back to square one.  This sucks.

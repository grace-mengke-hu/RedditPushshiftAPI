Day 21. Circle 3. Giving gold for a helpful comment about kindness to your addict.

I'm at Day 21 today and feeling very good about it. I want to say thanks to /u/my_vape_self for a helpful comment. 

Ten days ago I was struggling with "stage 2" stuff of quitting, the mind games that try to seduce you back into smoking. I was struggling to control my inner addict and failing. I felt like I had to "knife" it somehow to win.

I just love the way my_vape_self replied, so poetically, "He's not going to die. I'm going to take him to a farm upstate near Uncle Ben's. There's a big field there. And when he gets over this flu, he can play with the farmers other addictions. He'll have friends and plenty of room."

I know a lot of people quit smoking to take control back, but the comment suggested the opposite, being kind to my addict. Not killing it but being generous. Yeah, it seemed like something I should have known, and it really made a difference. It's about a shift in attitude that recognizes you will struggle with addiction, without getting obsessed or angry about it. Letting it pass with patience.

Thanks. Gold sent.

My modest (and perhaps helpful) success story

I smoked a pack a day for three years, started during a long road trip from New Mexico to Louisiana. What else are you supposed to do for 1,400 miles of Texas? Anyway, I recently decided I want to make a number of personal changes, including a drastic reduction of the amount of poisons I put in my body: Drugs (recreational), alcohol, shit food and, of course, smokes. So I went on a 10-day juice fast just to re-calibrate, to feel what it felt like to feel healthy, to give my body only what it needed and nothing more.

So I had this gnawing hunger for the first few days as I juiced. But, for me, anyway, the biggest cravings came after eating. I hardly noticed I wasn't smoking because, one, I didn't eat enough to crave a cig and, two, my hunger was a far more salient craving. I was also worried that quitting smoking would make me gain weight. The fact that I was only drinking about 24 oz of juice a day for 10 days removed that worry.

And here I am 18 days, 21 hours, 58 minutes, 36 seconds and counting later, and I've never felt better. I lost weight, can run freely and I've stopped poisoning myself. I think clearly, taste my food and breathe deep.

So that's my two cents, which I'll gladly donate from the $122.85 I've saved.

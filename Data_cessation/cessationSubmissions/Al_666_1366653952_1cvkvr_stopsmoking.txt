My method behind my insanity

I've been smoking for 6 years I have found a way to quit that is helping me currently I hate chewing but I bought a can of Grizzly winter green when I have the urge to smoke I pack my can and take about a dime sized piece and chew than I spit it all out. Than when you quit smoking you drop the chew

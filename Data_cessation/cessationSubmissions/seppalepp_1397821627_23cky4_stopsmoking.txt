How does this sub feel about smoking cigars?

I was so hesitant to smoke a cigar for the first two to months of quitting.  But now that I'm two months out I was talking with my roommate yesterday in a smoky bar and telling him how much I missed smoking.

Not that I wanted a cigarette, or wanted to start smoking again... I just sometimes get nostalgic about going out on the deck, lighting up a cigarette at night and checking out the skyline. 

So we poured ourselves a cocktail, and lit up a cigar. It was nice. I feel like cigars are something that *personally* wouldn't smoke everyday, they're too time consuming, and just the taste is something that I almost value as an occurrence rather than a habit. 

Anyone else have any thoughts?

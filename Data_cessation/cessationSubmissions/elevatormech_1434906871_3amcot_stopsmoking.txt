Hello everyone.

I decided to check back here like I do from time to time, and I always feel the same way when I do.  This is an amazing place filled with support from people who are going through the same exact thing.  I don't rely too much on this sub anymore personally but I see a lot of people here who are starting their journey, and some people who are deep into theirs offering awesome advice.  You guys do an awesome job, and to be honest I think I would still be a smoker if it wasn't for the support and advice of this awesome community.  Thank you everyone for all you do.

Stopping today :)

Ive been smoking for about a year now since i hit rock bottom and thought smoking would relieve stress. Ive been lurking this sub for a while now and it hit me that 
a) I can do this since my dad smoked for 20 years and stopped cold turkey when I was born

b) smoking is a decision, much like brushing my teeth or watching tv. Its my choice, not the cigarettes, when I want to quit 

c) if I can stop a really bad habit, what good habits can I start? 

d) my teeth look like shit


I have about 9 cigarettes I'm about to throw away because I would rather throw away money now than throw my life away later on down the road. I couldve stopped yesterday but today I will stop.

Day 7... Feeling Great!

I really can't thank this sub enough.  Even all the lurking around I do and reading about others experiences has made this process a lot easier.  

Drank booze this weekend and hung out with smokers, no cravings.  The smell, which is usually like honey to a bear, actually turned me off.  The overwhelming feeling of giving in every time I lit up is gone!! I'm in control here! Loving this!

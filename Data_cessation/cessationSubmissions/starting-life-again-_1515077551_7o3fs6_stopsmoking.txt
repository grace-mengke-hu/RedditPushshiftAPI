75 Days and Going Strong

Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to acknowledge that I've made it this far. I'm glad to say I made it through the holidays and that I entered the new year with over 70 days behind me. I wont lie, there has been some difficult times. I thought for sure I would relapse at just under 60 days but silly things kept me going, like wanting to see a badge with a red star as opposed to a green one. Whatever works right? Despite that rough patch, I'm still going strong and feeling great. For those starting out or thinking about it, I can only say it feels amazing and it is definitely worth all of the cravings and difficulty to have fresh breath and more money. 

Wishing you all a smoke free day!

Almost 1 week

I'm a 21 year old who smoked a whole package every day for about 7 years. As the title mentions it'll be one week starting from tommorow that i've quit smoking cold turkey. It feels like i've never smoked in my whole life and i haven't had any cravings during the past 4 days (even though my father and brother smoke in my presence). These last 4 days i've been having trouble sleeping. I always wake up at 4:30 am  feeling super energetic and unable to catch some rest. I've already tried to do some exercices during the day and drink green tea etc. everything to help me sleep better , but nothing seems to work for me. I also feel no different from when i was smoking as to now. The only thing that keeps me motivated is knowing that i will finally destroy an addiction that caused me alot of stress.

Am I the only one in this matter or did anyone of you experience any sleep disorder?

26 hours in - terrible cravings so far...

**Sorry for the walk of text - it turned into a bit of a rant!**

So I had my last smoke at about 8pm yesterday, and it's not 10pm today. I got through this morning fairly easily, had a couple of cravings but nothing major. Went out for lunch at work, and realised all I actually do on lunch is smoke! I'd eat my sandwich at my desk, then go out and spend an hour smoking... It truly is a terrible habit.

This mean's I spent an hour of my lunch, walking around, wishing I could smoke. I almost caved, but managed to convince myself not to, and went back up. I was then fine up until an hour ago. I was playing GTA V, and paused the game for a moment. All of a sudden, I had an overwhelming urge to have a cigarette. I actually left my house, and took a walk to the shop. I stood near the shop for about 15 minutes, with my body screaming for a cigarette, and my mind resisting...

I didn't do it. I didn't give in. It was one of the hardest thing's I've done in a long while, but I did it.

Is it normal for cravings to be this strong, this early on? I was a smoker for 4 years, and have been going through 20 a day for the last 6 months or so (before that, it could be anywhere between 10 and 20 per day).

Any help would be great! I've just signed up for a badge, I'm tracking progress with an app and I'm reading Allen Carr's book (almost half way through), so this time I'm determined to quit - for my girlfriend, and the baby that's on the way!!

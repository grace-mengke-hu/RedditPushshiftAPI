Quitters survey to get £25!!

Hi all,

I am Rebecca Anthony from Suffolk, England and finishing my Masters at the University of Groningen.

We are currently conducting research and we are looking for daily smokers who are intending to quit smoking somewhere in the coming 6 months.

The online questionnaire will take about 15 minutes; in one month the second and last very brief questionnaire will follow.

When you help us out you will be added into a lottery to win one of 4 cash prizes of £25.

If you would like to take part, please follow the link below.

Many Thanks

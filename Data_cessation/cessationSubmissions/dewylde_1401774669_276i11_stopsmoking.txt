DAE experience diarrhea when they quit?

Hi guys, I've smoked for 12 something years, and I've finally quit just over a month ago. Sometime around my 2nd week of quitting i started experiencing some unexplained form of diarrhea. I'm experiencing no accompanying pains, fever, or nausea whatsoever. In fact i feel perfectly fine. I've had all my tests done and so far the doctors think there's nothing wrong with my stool tests (sorry Too much information there). I've pointed out to the doctors that I just recently quit, but they've so far brushed that aside.

Now they're advising me to take a blood exam to check on hyperthyroids and possible diabetes. But before I do, i wanted to see the frequency of this occurring with the rest of everyone here.

I have not smoked a single cigarette since i quit, and I don't intend to. I've seen a replete of blogs and medical reports reporting on diarrhea as one of the withdrawal symptoms without touching much on the details. Some say its the body's way of *detoxifying* the tar nicotine thats been stored by all the smoking.

Its been over 3 weeks and its getting me worried.

If you have experienced this, how long did it last? Tips on speeding up the process? Any advice on the topic is much appreciated.

I know i should be taking my doctors' advice (and I will), but i'd like to see what the good people of /r/stopsmoking have to say as well. Ciao!

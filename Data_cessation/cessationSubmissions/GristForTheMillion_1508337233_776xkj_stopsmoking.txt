I made it just over seven months before I had one.

I went out on a guys night out overnight on a boat with a couple of old friends that like to smoke when they get away from the family. I had a few. It was nasty. I don’t regret it. I’m not resetting. I see no point in ever doing it again. I don’t feel like I failed. I feel like I won.

Thanks, guys!

I found this sub in a desperate moment few days ago and, as much as it's been an incredible help to me, a lot of times it's all seemed too good to be true. It felt as if this was easy for everyone here except me.

However, today I've noticed a lot of posts regarding people restarting their badges because they screwed up, or lapsed.

Far from being discouraged, this has helped me to realise that everyone here's human, and everyone's struggling. I'm relating a little more now.

Also, everyone's honesty, with regards to quitting, is admirable.

I just wanted to say thanks for the support!

Quit smoking but still vaping?

Hey all. I hope everyone is doing fine and not smoking! I wanted to stop by and ask a question. I've been smoke free for a whopping two days now but have continued to vape to combat nicotine withdrawal, for now at least. I plan to quit that too at some point. I was curious what withdrawal symptoms might be when quitting smoking but still receiving nicotine. Should I expect anything crazy? I only ask because I know nicotine is addictive but I imagine there are plenty of other chemicals I became addicted to as well while smoking cigarettes. Curious is all.

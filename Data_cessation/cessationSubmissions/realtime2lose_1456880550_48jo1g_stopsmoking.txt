Feeling sort of down

Hey guys, I'm new to this sub but I quit smoking about 6 months ago after I had surgery.  Well typical story I felt strong and after a few drinks smoked after about the 5 month mark.  Since then I've steadily been smoking more and more telling myself I can control it.  I'm at day two of not smoking again and I feel so discouraged that I was stupid enough to let me self get back to this point.  I keep telling myself not to smoke,  but then think why not? It's going to be impossible to quit.  I guess I just need to find a way to get my positivity back.  Anyone have any advice?

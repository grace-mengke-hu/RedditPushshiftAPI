Struggling today

I'm just over a month, no cigarettes. It's been amazing the journey so far. Every once in awhile I get stuck by a strong desire to smoke but I usually am able to move past it. This time, I cant seem to. It started yesterday and I cant seem to shake it. My brain keeps saying I can smoke if I want to. I reply to it, I can also NOT smoke if i want to. But a piece of me wants to sneak one anyway...ugh. HELP!

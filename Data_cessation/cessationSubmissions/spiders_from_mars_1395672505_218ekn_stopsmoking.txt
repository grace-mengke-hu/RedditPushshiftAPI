First Day. How am I supposed to do this?

I've only smoked for about 8 months, usually around 1/3 to 1/2 a pack a day. I started with the patch this morning after going a full 20 hours without a cigarette.

I've been doing reading, and from what I can tell, this is going to be awful. Truly awful. I have no idea how I'm going to manage this and stop myself from indulging. Does anyone have any advice for different ways to look at quitting that helped them when they got started? Or tips for keeping my hands occupied on breaks?

Thanks in advance! A crazy amount of respect to all of you!

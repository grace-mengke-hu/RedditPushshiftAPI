"Im a non smoker"

I think I just need some support right now. I have quit 2 of my chronic addictions this year being cigarettes and weed. I had abused weed for about 6 years and tobacco for maybe 3 years. However this past few weeks I have noticed myself drinking more, probably having something to do with me getting hired at a bar. 

I have a few things going on in my mind right now. The main reason I posted is because I have been drinking tonight and had the thought of seriously going to buy 'one' cigar smoke the 7/11. It has been a lot harder for me to resist the cravings now than when I first quit cigarettes, was it like this for anyone else in the 2nd and 3rd month quit?

The other thing bothering me doesnt have to do with this sub directly but Id like to get it out. I am not even close to an alcoholic yet, but I feel with my personality and the fact that I cant even handle weed in moderation makes me think that my alcohol consumption may creep up over time to replace smoking those substances. The thought of being sober all the time is hard to think of, and If eventually I cant even handle alcohol I dont know what Ill do. Im not suicidal anymore but I dont feel like life is worth living. By that I mean I will make the best of what Ive got since I had no choice to be born and try to achieve my goals, but If i cant even do any substances it feels like life will be so hard.

I dont know. My mind is just fucking trying to get me to rationalize to go buy a cigar right now so bad. Telling myself oh Ill just have one, and tomorrow maybe ill quit drinking also, so just have a cigar tonight to celebrate. Its fucking bullshit and I know it, but its still so tempting. I know smoking tastes like shit, and it makes me feel worse, and basically every single thing about it sucks but the cravings have been getting harder lately. Fuck that, Im glad I posted here instead of going to the store because I feel close to relapsing some days lately. Thanks for reading.

day 0 - just made the decision

been wanting to quit for a long time. it's disgusting- the smell, the after tase. infrequent smoker here anyway, 2-3 a day, first one usually around 3pm, last one usually around 9pm. Just smoked one half way through and realized it was my time.

thinking a lot about health, kids and other things in life which are more important than f*cking cigarettes. spent last hour watching youtube videos about quitting, just ordered Allen Carr's book on amazon. 

Keeping one last cigarette in the pack as a trophy, not throwing it away. Is this a good idea? Want to remind myself that I have control over my life, not some cardboard box.

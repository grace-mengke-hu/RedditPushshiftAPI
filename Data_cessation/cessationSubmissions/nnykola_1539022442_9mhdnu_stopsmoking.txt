Today is my 3rd day...breezed through the first 2 days, today it hit me: anxiety, irritability and aggression

Happy days...I was so happy with how the first two days went by, I almost didnt have any symptoms except for slightly increased appetite and some fatigue during the day. 

I guess it built up and today was the day. I feel so frustrated and angry that I nearly chocked my dog during the walk...normally I would have loads of patience when he flips out and gets his energy bursts when he sees other dogs, but not this time...I just dragged him along with so much fury running down my veins, its scary. 

I feel like a pressure cooker and I keep avoiding my wife because I have some things I would like to discuss with her as well :PP

Wish me luck

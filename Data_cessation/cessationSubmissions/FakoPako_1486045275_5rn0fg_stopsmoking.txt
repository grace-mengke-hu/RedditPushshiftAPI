Hello all of my 2016 New Year smokers! It's been over a year since we smoked! How does it feel now? Pretty fucking awesome  isn't it? 

I am very glad not to smoke anymore. I don't even know why I did for so long, when I think about it. The benefits are out of this world. Funny thing is, the benefits are all what non-smokers get and feel! I was purposely depraving myself of those nice benefits by smoking. For 25 years, I poisoned my body with those things. But I will not beat myself up anymore for doing it. Now it's time for me to better myself. I been trying to workout steadily this year. 2016 was the year of quitting smoking. 2017 is the year to get ripped and look fucking amazing by this summer!!!

I love working out now. I am slowly building my home gym after we purchased a house. I can't wait to get it all done! 

I wish couple of my friends would quit smoking. They still do. It sucks to see them smoke to be honest. It stinks. But I am not saying anything to them because I don't want to be one of those annoying "ex-smokers". So I just let it be, but I do make fun of them sometimes like "Man, you stink!" lol

All in all, I feel million times better. I don't even think about picking up a cigarette. It feels great. I feel like I am free! 

To all of you 2017 New Year quitters, YOU CAN DO IT! I did it...you can too! Stick to it. Get through the first couple months. Avoid the triggers, change your routines...you can do it. It's not as hard as you think!

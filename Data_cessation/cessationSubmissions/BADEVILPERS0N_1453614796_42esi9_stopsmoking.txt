I wanted to enjoy cigarettes again.

So I stopped smoking and drinking for five years and the last few months I went back to it all. I drank daily, a lot of times twice a day, smoked cigarettes and pot, did cocaine and ecstasy and smoked a little meth in a joint a few times, and tried to smoke what was supposedly black tar heroin but that didn't work out.

I wanted to even somewhat enjoy these things again. I've given up on trying to enjoy cigarettes. Still now a part of me wants to kind of enjoy them but I just can't. I have literally tried conservatively at least 30 different kinds of cigarettes these past few months, and I just hate them all. I miss the feeling of putting on painful shoes just so I can take them off again. This is Allen Carr's fucking fault. I mean I'm thankful but anyway. And pot and ecstasy and cocaine and crystal meth sucks balls too, but I'll spare you.

And the same fucking thing with drinking. I read "Easyway to Stop Drinking" as well but it's not that hard with all the negative side effects from drinking. From horrible, horrible, irreversible decisions made while drunk to the hangovers and headaches to the shitty taste and the drunkenness itself is uncomfortable and unbearable. My apartment was littered with fucking Steel Reserve and Icehouse Edge and I just couldn't love it again like I used to. I kept trying, hoping the next time would be better, would be different. I want to love. I want to love and enjoy an occasional drink, but I just don't anymore.

There's a lot more to this existential (I'm not using that word correctly but I don't give a fuck anymore...) bullshit that Allen Carr has unleashed on me, but I'll spare you for now. We'll see how it goes.

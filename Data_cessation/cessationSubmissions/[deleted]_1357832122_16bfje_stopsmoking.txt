Hooray! One Month!! Time to share some experiences!

Well, I've experienced quite a few changes over this past month. The first and most important one is that I haven't had a real craving for a cigarette in nearly two weeks! I also can confidently say I consider myself a non smoker now and all my smoking friends know it!

But besides this, I have a couple things I want to share:

* I can take a full breath now...I can actually inhale till my lungs are at 100% capacity and it feels great!
* The smell of cigarettes used to make me feel like cigarettes were a great past time but now they STINK! I can't stand the smell and I love that I can't stand it!
* I never realized that smoking was actually affecting my junk and over the past couple weeks, sex has been pretty great. I'm talking rock hard erections and twice the endurance!
* I've been attempting to quit for approximately a year now and the money I've saved on buying less and less packs has easily reached the 1000$ point. Over this past month however, I've saved approximately 120$ if I compared it to my old smoke habits.
* My mother hates smoking...I used to hide it from her and for the past few years, I think she thought I quit...now I don't have to hide it and feel guilty...this is easily one of my favorite parts of quitting.
* This kind of surprised me, but quitting smoking has lead me to significantly less drinking. Less drinking has also been a great addition to working out and am now on a great track to being very in shape!

I also would like to comment on a dream that I had a couple nights ago. I dreamed that I was back home with my family and for some reason, I decided to have a cigarette...the guilt of doing so destroyed me and I woke up in a fit of anxiety and for the rest of the day could not shake that feeling of guilt. That dream really spoke to me and figured I'd share that with you guys.

Finally, I would like to thank YOU guys...You have been great and its been awesome watching so many of you achieve great success in quitting. This subreddit means a lot to me and has been a constant reminder for me. Thank you guys so much and keep on keepin on!

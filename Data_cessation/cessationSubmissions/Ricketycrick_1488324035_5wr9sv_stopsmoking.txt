Just survived the worst craving of my life. Just wanted to talk about it

I'm on day 12, and I just got done with the worst 6 hour long craving of my life. I was counting the seconds at one point. Thinking about suicide the entire time. I'm not sure what happened, I think a normal craving got mixed in with one of those random bad days everybody gets, and it turned it into a snowball of misery. Anyways I'm past it now though! I think I need to watch my stress levels in the future so it never gets that bad again.

Anyways thanks for listening! Good luck to my fellow quitters! We can do this!

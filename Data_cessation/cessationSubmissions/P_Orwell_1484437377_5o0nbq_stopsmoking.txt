So close to one year.

 I was out for a walk today and it was such a nostalgic experience that for a moment I considered purchasing a pack of cigarettes. The experience didn't last long but its been gnawing at me for the last few hours, not enough to make me break but enough to cause concern. I am here to look at the progress I have made (less than two months and it'll be a year) and remind myself (and maybe a few others) not to give up. Thanks.

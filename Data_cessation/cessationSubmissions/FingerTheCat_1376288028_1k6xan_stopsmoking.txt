One day without a Cig. I think I can do this.

I have smoked for almost ten years now (I'm 25)..  It's been about six months since I thought seriously about quitting, but my mind always goes to them when I go throughout the day because of routine.  I've been reading stories and helpful tips around here, and it has encouraged me to quit for good.  I have a token, it's a coin I got from the Oblivion game of the year edition, which I have taped "don't smoke" on one side.  Whenever I have had a craving I get the coin out, allowing me to remember why I'm quitting.  It also gives my hands something to do like flipping or whatever, to try and curb the cravings.  Thanks for reading this rant (if you didn't just skip to the bottom)!  I think I can get this done.

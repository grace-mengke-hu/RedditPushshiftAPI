Your symptoms of withdrawal?

I 'accidentally' quit smoking a few days ago. Or more like got sick and can't get to the store so now I've decided to quit because it's convenient.
On top of previous my fever I also have withdrawal symptoms making me wanna die. Got a serious cough, runny nose, heat flashes, can't sleep well, crushing headache and so on.
How did those successful people get through this?!

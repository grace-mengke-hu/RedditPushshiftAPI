just put out the last one.

i am sitting in pittsburgh for work. i am 300 miles from home. i have been trying to quit for the past year. i am so tired of the way i feel all the time. i always feel sluggish, gross, stressed, and tired. at this point i recognize that cigarettes actually increase my anxiety overall. this smoking shit is impacting me too much. i actually make excuses to not have sex with my girlfriend because i know my stamina is awful and i don't even want to bother. i am sitting outside in a parking lot of a hotel smoking cigarettes by myself - no different than how i do it at home, but it's just so damn apparent how pathetic it is. i don't look out of shape, but holy god am i out of shape. my biggest trigger is that i truly believe that cigarettes keep me as small as i am. which is of course nonsense. tomorrow morning i buy some fruit juice to help with what i now recognize to be symptoms of low blood sugar. tomorrow morning i do this. in the time it took me to write this post, i already had a craving. i'll be back with my progress.

Getting the Flu and tasting cigs!

I am 27 and I quit about 5 months ago (woohoo!!) after a pack a day for ten years and I never got the coughing and mucus that accompanies some quitters. I have the actual Flu right now and am starting to taste nasty stale tobacco while I'm coughing my lungs out. It's gross and really weird since I've been cigarette free for 5 months! Has this ever happened to anyone else?

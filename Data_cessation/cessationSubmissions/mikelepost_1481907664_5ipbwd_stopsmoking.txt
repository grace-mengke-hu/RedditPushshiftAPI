Post quitting depression?

So I've on day 45/46 I think (last cigarette was 10/30) and I have a question:

For the first two weeks or so I had a depressive feeling like the world had been drained of color and everything was boring and pointless without cigarettes. I thought this was a pretty normal reaction to chemical changes and perhaps the sort of mental tricks the mind will play to keep you smoking.

The intensity of this feeling went away but pretty much since I quit I've had serious mood swings, anxiety / depression and an inability to control my emotions that has scared me a little. Full disclosure: depression / anxiety is something I've struggled with most of my life, mostly when I was younger (41 now), but it's been almost totally managed without medication or anything just by watching my health and especially working out. It's been back en force since my relatively recent quit.

Just wondering if anybody here experienced similar symptoms? And if so did it calm down @ some point?

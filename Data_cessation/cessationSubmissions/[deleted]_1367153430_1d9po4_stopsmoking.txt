I think I can, I think I can!

Well it's been 5 days now and I think I can do this. E-cigs have been saving me but I am trying to reprogram myself so as to think about my self as a non-smoker, which is something I've not been in 20 years. Being surrounded by non smokers helps and the benefits I have witnessed already are unimaginable. My daily runs are not as painful, my breath smells better, things are good. I have to thank all of the people at /r/stopsmoking. This forum has been awesome. It adds a little bit more accountability to the process, amazing how that little badge makes me want to keep on going. Thank you /r/stopsmoking!

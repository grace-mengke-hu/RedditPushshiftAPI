Sickness leads to quitting, and some things to think about...

I've written here before about how bad of a smoker I am, you can probably search my name in this sub to find that if you want. Basically I lacked motivation, my life was uphill for a long time too.

The older I get the more I can genuinely realize how much effect smoking has on the body. It reduces my overall energy levels enormously. That was fine when I could live off 2 hrs of sleep a day, as a high energy coffee addict, but now my years seem to be winding down a bit. (should I note that I'm lucky I don't have cancer for all my years of smoking...?)

Long story short, I have stuff to do, I want my energy back, I am motivated.

Last Fri I ate seafood, got food poisoning, and was bed ridden all weekend. I took advantage of the opportunity to "not" go buy a pack of cigs. And so it's been 4 days or so, and I am actually surprised at how well I am doing in comparison to past attempts.

Once the nicotine gets out, it's all mental.

Here are my current random thoughts, maybe they are good tips for some people, and please steer me straight if you see a problem.

* I can still go out to my home outdoor smoking spot for some fresh air and just to look around and breath in some fresh air or whatever, but I have removed the ashtray and don't smoke when I go there. I am replacing the old habit with a new one. 
* Maybe part of the reason I liked my smoke breaks was just because I wanted to go outside to begin with. I'm convincing myself that smoking was an excuse to go outside, and I don't need that excuse anymore. Luckily I am smart/dumb enough to believe myself on this.
* When the urge comes. STOP. Of course... but more importantly try to realize WHY? Why did the urge come? Remember, you are no longer physically addicted, so this is a mental habit you are fighting now. What were you just thinking or doing that led your mind to say "time for a smoke". Was it finishing a meal? Finishing a phase of work? Finishing a chapter of a book? Whatever it was... realize it, then tell your mind to do something else after that activity from now on. Focus all of your energy on that HABIT and ORDER IT in a different direction.
* It goes without saying I am avoiding bars for a while. Humans need company, luckily I have that much covered for now.
* Doing things like this reading and writing on the topic helps a lot. Hearing other's success stories and fail stories, both, are inspiring and informative.
* My new habit is making iced tea and drinking it, or pacing the floor, or just relaxing.
* I might get into meditation, that would obviously be a good replacement habit. 
* Never forget your motivation. Pull it out when you are fighting the habit.
* Remember that there are even more surprises to come besides your motivation. Every long-term quitter boasts of amazing happiness for quitting. 
* If all else fails. Buy a toy kitten, and punch it in the face. (I just had to add that)

Just now, as I finished the above list, I was about to stand up. I had finished something long, my butt has been sitting too long, and a cigarette came to my mind. Here I go:

"STOP. You just need to stretch your legs. Sitting is bad for you. It's okay to go for a quick walk or make tea or visit the fridge, but don't go near a smoke. You also probably want a break from reading and writing. That's fine. Do that. Then come back, review your writing, hit submit, and back to work. Stretch your legs again if need be. The war is over. Chill out. But do stay focused."

By writing that out I just noticed that I always go for a smoke when I want to stretch my legs. But I don't have to do that anymore. I can still stretch my legs, but just not smoke.

I feel so ridiculous writing that out, like I am quoting something from a moronic brainwashed character on Southpark. It seems so obvious from the outside.

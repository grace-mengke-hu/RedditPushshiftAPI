Having trouble...need some advice!

I set Feb 23rd as my quit day, since then I have has 12 smokes, which having been a pack/pack 1/2 a day smoker I figure I would have smoked 140 in that time and only had 12. But how to I get rid of that twelve. I am on the patch and also have lozenges. Also I guess I have to reset my quit date as well, right? I know these are strictly emotional ones, since I am on the patch, it isn't a true physical craving. You think e-cigs might help? I have been a pack/pack 1/2 smoker for 27 years. This is my first attempt at quitting.

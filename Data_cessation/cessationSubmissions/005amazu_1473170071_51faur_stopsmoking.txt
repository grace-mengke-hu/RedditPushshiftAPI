Got very drunk with friends at the bar and was dying to smoke!

But I told everyone I was almost 30 days smoke free beforehand. When I passed two girls smoking on the way home, I was determined to bum one. My friends grabbed both of my arms and dragged me home. 

Now I feel hungover, but I know I would have felt ten times worse even if I had just smoked one! Backup is key.

After nearly a decade..today feels like a small milestone

Been smoking (socially) since I was 16 and became habitual once I went to college. After being the only member of the family sneaking outside for a drag during the holidays, I figured I might try quitting cold-turkey. I haven't smoked since Sunday at 1 PM (a whole 72 hours) and I hear the first few days are the worst. Good thoughts to all those out there on the hourly struggle bus with me!

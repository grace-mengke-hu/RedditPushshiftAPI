I feel pathetic, need quick help :/

I've made the new years resolution to only smoke when there's a "festive" event with friends around, you know the deal, you guys probably made something like that up your own. Now I've drank some beers with a friend and watched a political tv-event. He left and now I'm only thinking of my balcony. What can I do to keep that thought away? :/

edit: you guys are great, thank you all for your kind words and these more than usefull tips. I think I'll hang out at this place more often! And no, I haven't rolled a cig :)

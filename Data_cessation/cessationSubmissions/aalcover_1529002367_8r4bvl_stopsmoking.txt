Started again after almost four months

I am kicking myself. ...  the stress level in my life is ten fold..... I bought a pack of cigarettes and had one.... needless to say it didt make me feel any better...  this is my fourth try in three years. .. quitting is hard as hell....when you put lifes terms along with the mix its even harder.... i havent given up... other wise I would not be posting this..... I have been reaping the benefits of being smoke free..... I really need some encouragement.....

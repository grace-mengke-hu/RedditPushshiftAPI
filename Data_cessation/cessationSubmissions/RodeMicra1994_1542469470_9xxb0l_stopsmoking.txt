PE

Hey guys.
I've got a question for you. (First a bit of history, see below for TLDR)
I had my first girlfriend when I was smoking for a few years. I already suffered from PE, but I thought it was mostly due to stress (we didn't really have  a healthy relationship).
When I had my second girlfriend, I noticed I lasted a little bit longer. Still not a champ, but enough to not make things uneasy. It's only now I realise that was a period when I hadn't been smoking for a few months. (She also was much less harsh with me, which made me more relaxed, and that helped as well with the stress problem).
I'm pretty sure there's a correlation between my smokes and my PE-problem. Only, I don't think I'm in a position to quit completely right now.
(anyway)
TLDR:
Does anyone know here whether my PE is caused by the last cigarette I smoked, or more by the habit of smoking?
Would it help if I didn't smoke, the day before I know I'll have intercourse?

I hope my question isn't out of place on this sub.

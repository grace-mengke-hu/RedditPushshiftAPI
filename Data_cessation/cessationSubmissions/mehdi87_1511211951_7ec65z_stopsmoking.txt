Not smoking on vacation

Hi everyone , I have an issue with quitting smoking, I recently went on vacation for a month, and only smoked ones, but the minute I came back home, I started smoking again and more than before. It's really annoying to tech this cap and give up so easily.
Any one has been through this? 
I think that stress is one of those things that makes me smoke, I tried doing more sport but still feel that I need those cigarettes to get through my days.

Waiting for the hammer to fall.

8 days in and I have had some mild problems (this isn't my first time quitting), but nothing like I remember before.  The main issue is sleeping.  I will wake up several times in the night, usually sweating and/or feeling confused.  Coughing some, but not terribly bad.  All in all, things are good.  This makes me nervous because I remember how awful previous attempts had felt, and I'm just wondering if it is going to be a matter of time before it happens again.  Here's to all of you, today is another day to not smoke.

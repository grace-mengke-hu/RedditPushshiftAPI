I am back for another go at this...

Moved house, smoked. Had a row, smoked.  Had a good day, smoked.  These were all just excuses to smoke, not a reason.  

I am back at this wonderful sub (which I read daily) to make a proper go of it so I can be free of this crap that is smoking.

I want to do it so I can stop putting poison in to my body and breath properly after climbing the stairs.

Been smoking since I was 15 (now 38) so I think its time to quit.

Good luck all and I will not smoke with you!

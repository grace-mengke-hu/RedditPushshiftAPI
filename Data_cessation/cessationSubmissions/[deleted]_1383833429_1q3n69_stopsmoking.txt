i thought the end of the world merited smoking. nothing mitigates heartbreak.

venting. sorry.

my bf of three years dumped me six weeks ago.  one week before we were going to vegas together, two weeks before we were going to europe together.  i just came home from work and he told me he was done and he left and i never saw him again.  i moved out of our apartment that we just leased three months prior, i went to europe by myself, i moved across the country, deleted him from my life (holy crap is it hard to get someone to stop using your netflix).  i'm trying to move on from a life i thought was forever that just.... ended after work one day.

the weekend he dumped me he wrote a post in r/stopsmoking.  we had quit smoking together and he was telling his story about being two years clean.  like a baby, i cried for hours. then i smoked.

he's all over reddit, my favorite site.  i just don't feel like i have anything left for myself anywhere.  every corner i turn i close my eyes and brace for a memory.  now, a place he never was before: /r/stopsmoking. 

i started smoking shortly after the break up.  i've decided to stop now.  it's easier after going through it before.  i'll make it.  after five days i know i'm out of the red.  just want to put this out there. because i'm just plain broken at 7 in the morning with no one to talk to... thanks for reading.

Two months through

Whoooooho.. 2 months :)!

Gotta say I had cravings. Some more the past two weeks. But they were okay and easy to take. Not a big deal.

Dreamt 2 times that I smoked and that it was no deal in the dream, that I could just stop from there right away again. Clever brain ðŸ˜„..

Yeah.. my story so far.. still happy that i stopped when I see others smoking stressful a cigarette before the bus arrives or you have to leave. Or if I smell that someone smoked recently.

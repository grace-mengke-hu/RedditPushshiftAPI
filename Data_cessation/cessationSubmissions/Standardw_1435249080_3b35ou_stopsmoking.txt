Brig my mom to stop smoking

Hello,

I'm not smoking. My mom does. I would say 10 cigs a days. sometimes more, sometimes less. Did not write it down. 

Anyway I told her all the pro and cons to stop smoking (even though there were no cons?), but she says that she doesn't want to stop. She's already above 50 years and yeah, I don't want her to die soon. 

Now my idea was this:
We don't have that much money at home, and we would need a new couch. Really need. I have money, not that much but this wouldn't hurt. I thought about telling her, that when she stopped smoking until christmas, I would get her a new couch. I would do it anyway btw)

Do you think this might work? We are 4 people at home so a new couch would be really good.

Thanks for help!

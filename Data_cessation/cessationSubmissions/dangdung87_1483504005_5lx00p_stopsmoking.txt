I quit smoking.

About 3 months ago I quit smoking. It was my 6th attempt in my 8 years of smoking (21-29). 

The previous attempts went from two days to one month. What caused me to quit was my throat. I was sick of spitting that stuff out in the morning, and the things that come with it. I smoked alot at that time, abit more than a pack a day. As I went to bed one night I felt how my throat was already getting sore. That was point where I decided to quit. I would finish my last cigarette pack and just not smoke any after. Oh boy, the disappointment and sadness I felt the following day when I opened that package around noon to find it empty. The first two days were similar to the previous 5 times. But it has been 3 years since I last tried to quit. I didn't remember the longing to be as intense as I expirienced it this time. I stayed strong, stuffed my belly with snacks and saw through. My desire for smoking has completly vanished by now. When I see other people smoking it's not strikingly tempting, definitly endurable. 

I'm glad I quit.

Proud of myself...

Tonight i went to the movies, after that i got pulled over by the cops, bare in mind i live in a country where police are very "difficult", and i got in a 2 hour argument, after that they let me go, and in those 2 hours i was nervous and people around me smoked and i was strong enough to  avoid the temptation, went home drank a glass of wine mingled with my friends and even after my drink i didn't get the urge to smoke!

Now i believe i stopped smoking, thanks for sharing your stories it helped me to understand how to control the urge.

Always talk with myself saying it isn't worth to pick up a cigar.

And if you are in a bad situation and you light up a cigar it will be much worst because instead of one problem you revived another...

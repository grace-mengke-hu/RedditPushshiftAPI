Trying to stop, but I suddenly have pain in my left throat.

My throat has been hurting a lot recently, and I'm a bit worried. 

I'm 21 and I've been smoking a pack a day for 3/4 a year. At 18, I've smoked 3 packs a month until I started drinking. I've realized that this is incredibly Dangerous and I've always wanted to stop; but I simply can't. I'm about to go to an AA meeting this week to end my alcoholic adventure, and I hope that'll stop most of my problems. 

The main reason I do this is because I'm studying to become an Aviation Maintenance Technician. I have to save lives by not making a single mistake. It's really stressful. One LITTLE mistake and everything goes to shit. 

I just want to end this alcoholism and cigarette habit so I can focus on what's really important; saving lives.

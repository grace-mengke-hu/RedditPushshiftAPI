Today marks my longest period being smoke free: 6 months + 1 day. I never thought it would happen.

Thing is - someone left a pack of smokes at my house and it's in my drawer, but mere thought of even taking one makes me remember all those times I failed... and how bad I felt... and all the weight I gained... and all the shit I dealt with... And they'll sit there as a reminder and testament to my commitment.

Saw an old friend(enemy), frenemy?

Today I was cleaning out my car and stumbled upon an old pack. I am happy to say I didn't even think for a split second to light one up. I just calmly threw it away with the rest of the trash I was cleaning. It felt very liberating being able to deny the old self of pointless habits. I hope everyone who is new to quitting can feel what I felt today. It my not seem like much on a computer screen, but when you do get this feeling, it will feel like quitting was the best damn decision you have ever made.

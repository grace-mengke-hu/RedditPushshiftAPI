UBER Aggressive!

It's been 3 days and by now I am a terrible monster... I can cope with the cravings but I am very nervous and really aggressive. 

I can't do anythign about it - I am in full bitch mode. I should prolly bake a cake for all the people I was mean to today. 

Anyone of you having the same trouble? Any Solutions?

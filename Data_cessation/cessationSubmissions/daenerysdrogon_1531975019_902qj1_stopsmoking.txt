Day 5, at constant battle with myself. [vent]

For some reason I thought by now I would have been sure this was the right decision, but I keep questioning if it truly was. This could very well be my addict mind trying to keep my addiction fueled but it doesn’t make it any less annoying because I feel like it won’t ever go away. I don’t want a voice saying “what if you’re just meant to live life as a smoker?” lingering in the back of my mind for the rest of my life. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love being able to walk without feeling like 10 bricks are on my chest, and I like the way my car smells without cigarettes..but I also really miss that morning cig with my coffee. And I miss routine. I just miss smoking. A lot. 
You know how people say an addict must hit “rock bottom” before they get help? I’m nervous that I never actually hit rock bottom or hated smoking enough to take this process as seriously as I should.  I just really hope it gets a bit easier from here on out because idk how much more I can take honestly. There’s really no point to this other than I needed to vent and this community has helped me so much thus far.

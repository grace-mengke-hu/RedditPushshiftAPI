It feels great.

Found this sub-reddit about 4 days ago. Bought Allen Carr's book, and read about half, at which point I decided that I was, in fact, strong enough mentally to tackle this problem. Smoke free for 2 days now, both of which I've completed 2 mile runs each morning. I intend to keep this up. Just wanted to stop in and say thanks to everyone for posting their experiences and recommendations, so that I could lurk and find my own way!

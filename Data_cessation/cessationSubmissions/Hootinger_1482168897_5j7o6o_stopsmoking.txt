I am Really struggling with the physical Withdrawal symptoms.

I quit about a year ago, was good for 100 days, and then did the whole "I can have just one for old times sake" thing and obviously got hooked again. As such I am once again enduring the nicotine withdrawal I went through last time. This sub is immensely helpful. I just need to rant, sorry. 

I see on here some people say that they didnt have the withdrawal symptoms or that they werent that bad. I must be different or something because my experience both the first time I quit and now is just brutal. I am feeling all the symptoms and it seems like they are enhanced to a ridiculous degree. 

I have a headache and nausea worse than any hangover Ive ever had, I can at times barely hold my head up. I have extreme anger (rage level) and anxiety and depression---like if I am not screaming at someone I am crying. I feel tense and anxious and fearful. I cant sleep. I cant focus or concentrate, even typing this post is difficult, its like I cant think of the words or how to type. I get confused easily, It's like I cant figure out what to do, at 4-way  intersection I cant understand when I am supposed to go, it is messed up. I sweat all the time. My teeth ache. Basically look up symptoms of withdrawal and I have all of them maximized. I feel like what I imagine someone coming off an opium addiction or something would feel. Why is it physically so painful/difficult for me? 

Last time this feeling lasted for like two weeks. It was so terrible. I am on day 3 now---last time day 3 is when the intense feeling of doom set in so I am looking forward to that. Last time I had to leave work early with a sick day. I just sat in my car and sweated and my hands were shaking. I have some of that now. I get asking myself if it was even worth it. This is so, so so hard, I cant even explain it. This is awful.

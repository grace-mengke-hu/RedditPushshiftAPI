So I tried to quit today

Woke up at 8am, realized that today I had planned to quit. I had 1 half cigarette in the ashtray, knew it was the last. Went back to sleep. Woke up at 10. Smoked the half cig, not enough. Went back to sleep. Woke up several times. Refused to get up because I knew I didn't have cigs. Finally forced myself to get up at 3pm. Hungry. Ate some chips and salsa. Aftermeal-cig crave. Pace back and forth for like an hour. 5pm, drive to the store to buy more cigs. 7pm, sitting at the computer, chain smoking cigs, wide awake. Could have gone better.

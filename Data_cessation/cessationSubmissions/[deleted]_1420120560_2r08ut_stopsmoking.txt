Thank you and farewell. Here's to your freedom from smoking in 2015.

3x3. That's how quitting smoking works. 3 days of physical withdrawal. 3 weeks of mind games. 3 months till you finally bid smoking the big emotional good-bye for good. It's 3  months for me and time to say good-bye to smoking and farewell to the sub.

Maybe there is one more step. I quit once for 10 years, can you believe it? I truly became a non-smoker, to the point I became as naive as any non-smoker and thought it was just silly fun to have one smoke at a party. If one smoke is okay, then why not another? You all know what happens next. The prime directive of quitting smoking ... there is no such thing as one cigarette. Thank you Mr. Carr.

It took about three years for me to get to the three months of freedom again, and I am there. I bid smoking good-bye. I will not smoke again, not even if my wife picks it up again in the summer, which she might. 

This group has been terrifically helpful. Really helped at every step of the way. It helped me deprogram the junk that smoking put back in my brain. What is so great about the group is that it is there 24x7. Thank you! I hope I have given back a bit with the [Club 31] posts. Congrats to you all.

I am unsubscribing today. I get it that for the some it is important to hang around. It is important for me to move on. I have other self-improvement challenges I want to focus on. Best wishes. Here's to your freedom from smoking in 2015.

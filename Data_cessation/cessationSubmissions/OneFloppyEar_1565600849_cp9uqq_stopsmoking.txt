I am so relieved!

I had a few smoking dreams early in my quit, but they went away, and I've been so delighted to be a non-smoker for over seven months. Last night though, I dreamed I was smoking cigarette after cigarette. Real cigarettes, too, not the rollies I smoked for the last few years. I was arguing with people in the dream who were telling me to stop, saying I was just going to have one more, that after seven months I had proved that I could start and stop any time. I woke up in a coughing fit that lasted about 5 minutes, as if I really had been smoking, and it took me a while to realise that it was only a dream.   


Still smoke free! We can do this.

Easyway for a week, smoked a pack at a party 2 nights ago, brute force back onto the schedule. A question and some observations if I may...

First of all, I conned myself into buying the pack because 'ohhh woe is me everyone will be drinking (I'm a recovering alcoholic,) and there will be heaps of people smoking so yeah, I need to get them because I'll just be scabbing otherwise...' etc etc...

The reality? Up until around 1am I was outside by myself smoking while everybody partied it up inside. Even when the fire did get cranked up and everybody moved outside I was one of about 3 people. I've never really noticed how unpopular it has become before.

It did nothing for me. Nothing whatsoever. Didn't ease my nerves, didn't feel particularly good... Perhaps I just needed to remind myself this in a way.

Anyhow, my question is as such- I haven't felt much by way of withdrawal in the last day and a half, a bit if the usual twang around my usually scheduled cig breaks, though I am fighting the urge to buy another pack. Am I effectively starting again now? I can't really gauge how I'm feeling at the moment; not sure if I should brace myself for another week of emotional torment or if I might find it a little easier having learned that vital lesson.

TL:DR; smoked pack at party, came to senses next day, am I back to square one re: withdrawal?

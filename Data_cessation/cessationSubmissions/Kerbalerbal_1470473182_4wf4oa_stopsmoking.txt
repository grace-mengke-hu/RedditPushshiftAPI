going to a party

So I'm of to a party tonight and my quit has been going quite well. However I'm what you call 'socially awkward ' and I'm mildly concerned about the triggers I'm going to encounter along with the awkward thing. Luckily my partner is also coming and I have no doubt she will beat me if I smoke. Does anyone have like a mantra or something that helps them with cravings? If not, some support would go a long way. Thanks.

Starting day 2

I'm waiting at the bus stop, on my way to work. My buses are being delayed by this thunderstorm and I'm going to be late for work. I'm bored as fuck, but I'm not going to smoke. I'm enjoying my ritualistic cup of morning coffee, but I'm not going to smoke....cigarettes don't cure bordem, they just kill you while you're bored. Also, cigarettes and thunderstorms....don't mix.

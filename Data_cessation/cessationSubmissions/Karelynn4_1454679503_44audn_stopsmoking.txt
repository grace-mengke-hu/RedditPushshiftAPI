Emotional

I'm so depressed and emotional about this decision. This is stupid, but I feel like I'm losing part of my identity. I'm supposed to go back home next weekend and I almost don't want to because I'm afraid of what it will be like there as a non smoker. Sometimes I even wonder why I started this quit process to begin with.

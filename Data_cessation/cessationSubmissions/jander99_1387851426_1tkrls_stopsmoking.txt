How should I read Easy Way?

So I picked up Alan Carr's book (the Americanized version) and I've started reading it.  I was wondering how I should consume the material.  Should I sit down and just read it all in one go?  Right now, I've been reading a few chapters (they are short) at a time, and letting it sink in.  Of course, part of me thinks in doing this I'm simply using a delay tactic.  Any recommendations from folks who've used Easyway?

How should I stop smoking?

Hey guys,

Been smoking for 8 years now I think. Had a 1,5 ish year break but started again 3 years back. I smoke around 20 cigs on a workday and sometimes up to 30 or 40 on a weekend day. I can smoke until I get a cracking headache or get dizzy and still keep smoking. It is getting a little out of hand.

For me, smoking is something I do when I'm bored, this could be waiting for bus, waiting for my computer to start up.. anything basically. My biggest fear is that my excessive eating will come back but that is a different subreddit ;) My biggest obstacle is the habit, the quick breaks that segment my day into manageable little pieces.

I really want to stop, and I'm excited about it. However, there is no bigger setback than falling back into the habit. How should I proceed?

A smoking app that tracks the money you saved and how much cigs you didn't smoke is something I've enjoyed in the past so I'm definitely doing that.

But should I quit cold turkey? I don't see myself lowering the dose, the temptation is too big for me. Maybe use an E smoker? Nicotine patches?

Sorry if this is something you guys see everyday and is boring or stupid.

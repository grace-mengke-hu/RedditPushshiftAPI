I am hanging out with a friend tonight. We've been friends for about 20 years. When we hung out last weekend, it was the first time that neither of us was smoking. It was awesome. Between then and now, he caved. We have basically spent the entirety of our relationship smoking. It was one of the things that bonded us in middle school/high school. I am still committed to staying quit, but I am worried about the combination of him and drinking and not having my SO (my biggest non-smoking supporter) with me. I will be checking Reddit periodically and I would love to get support throughout the night. Especially as I have never gotten to the point where I think cigarettes smell bad. They still smell so good......  



Edit: thank you guys!!!! I am in for the night and still tobacco free! I appreciate the messages!

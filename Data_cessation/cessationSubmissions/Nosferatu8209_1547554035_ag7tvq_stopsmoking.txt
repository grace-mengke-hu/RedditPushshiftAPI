14 days and I discovered that fabric softeners actually have a nice scent!

So here I am on day 14, sleeping much better, moving much better, in fact I started jogging a bit to combat the weight issue that is associated with quitting smoking... and hell yes, even though I try to minimize, I eat a bit more!!! During the day I have no problems but evenings are tricky so I keep telling myself 1 evil at a time...

Funny thing though, you discover new things... I always thought that fabric softeners were unnecessary as they (at best) had a faint scent that went away after 2 hours of wearing an item. Now I realize that it is not the case :) I love the feeling of being able to pick up all different scents of flowers, fresh linen etc.

Cravings? although not severe they pop up here and there but are much better to chase away. I take a glass of water, or go for a walk, or take a shewing gum, read this thread, look at the app - basically shift the focus away.

Good luck everyone!

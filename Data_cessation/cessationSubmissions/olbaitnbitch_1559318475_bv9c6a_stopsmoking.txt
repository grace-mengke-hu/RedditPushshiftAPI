(Most-Definitely, Gotta-Be) The Final Quit

I'd signed an unspoken agreement with myself after I bought my first pack of Marlboro Reds at age 14: that the arrival of my first child would be lights out on my smoking life. Gotta make room for a new life by taking out an old. My son was born on the last day of April, was supposed to be my last day as a smoker. That held true for two weeks and then...well what ever is it anyway that drags us back to the pack? Any reason fabricates its own validity when the craving's strong enough. Albeit a month late in honoring the pact I made with my teenage self, this last day of May IS my last day a 30 year-old father who smokes. THE VERY LAST. 

I wanna chase (and catch!) my grandbabies 30 years from now.

Smoking Isn't the Answer to Anything

In my opinion it's not nicotine that's so bad, it's the bloody smoke.  And smoke enough and there will be blood.  I quit at 59.  Soon enough.  Don't wait until you say "I wish I never started."

Smoking is not the answer to successful sex, a home run, a great meal, a sunset, or a stroll through the park.  Breathing is. Deep, natural, thankful breathing.

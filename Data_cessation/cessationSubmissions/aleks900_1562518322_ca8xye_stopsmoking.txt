One day at a time...

I have been smoking since I was 17 (I am 29 now), pack a day, sometimes more... Tried to quit only once 10 years ago, had terrible withdrawal symptoms. I consider myself strong person and very persistent, however smoking was my weakness. I used to say I will not quit until I am ready, but when I quit there is no back. One week ago, doctor told me I have beginning of emphysema (no symptoms) and I should quit smoking. And I did, next day... This last seven days were actually easier than expected, day 3 was tough, on day 4 I had a fight with close friend which made me very stressed, on day 6 had two beers. No smoking or major cravings so far. But I am kind of afraid what if cravings come after or something terrible happens that I will lose my will power. It feels like it's a battle without an end.

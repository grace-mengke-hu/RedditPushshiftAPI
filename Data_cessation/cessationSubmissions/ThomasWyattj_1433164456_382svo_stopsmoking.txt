Let's do this! I Just ripped up my packet of Cigarettes

I am 25 years old, turning 26 in August. I smoked for a few years on and off casually, but full time for about 6 years. I have really wanted to quit for a long time, and tonight, I ripped up my packet of cigarettes. I am so glad you folks at /r/stopsmoking are here to support myself and others in the same position. I would like to Thank you all very much in advance for the help I will defiantly require. Also, congratulations for everyone who is smoke free!

One year as a non-smoker. Thank you fellow redditors and thank you Allen Carr!

I can't believe it has been a year.  I can say with total certainty that I couldn't have done it without you all!  Thank you for your support and for directing me to Allen Carr's "Easy Way" video.  If you're wondering whether you too can quit--you can.

Today is the day.

I have been lurking on here for a bit and have finally decided that now is my time to stop smoking. Nicotine has been Queen Bitch in my life for 7 years and I'm finally ready to not have to rely on something so silly to get me through my day. Just wanted to thank everyone on here for their posts, big and small. All the advice and success stories have been what I have needed to come to this decision.

All thanks to Allen Carr......'s WEBCAST?!!

Thought I'd share my story for you guys.  I've been trying in earnest to quit since June of last year, every week or so making a fresh attempt.  Most of the time wouldn't make it past 24 hours.  I quit for about 3 weeks back in August thanks to the EasyWay book, but had too much to drink one night and relapsed.  My secret to success was to actually discover that my drinking problem was truly responsible for me being scared to quit smoking, so I quit drinking first!  Thoroughly recommend /r/quitdrinking if you're curious.  I gave it about a week, then bought the easywaytostopsmoking.com webcast on Wednesday, smoked my last, and here I am, smoke-and-alcohol-free and feeling great!  

I recommend the webcast to anyone who read the book and still had trouble, my problem is I tend to read quickly and skim when I'm bored, so I didn't take the time with the book for all the information to really sink in.  With the webcast you're on their time, and it really helped me absorb what they were saying.  But regardless, good luck to you all!

Back again

I'm back. I was here a few months ago and this place helped me get through two months smoke free. Not nicotine free, but smoke free. I was on the patch. Shortly after coming off the patch, I caved. And quit. And caved. And quit. And caved. So tired of the cycle.
Fast forward, I am about to end day four. No smokes although I really really really want one right now. I've been using nicotine gum and my old vape instead. 
I doubt that things would have gone differently if I hadn't deleted my account out of embarrassment over failing last time. I know that I do need a place to rant and vent and type like crazy when a craving hits where people understand. Thanks for still being here....

Panic attacks after quitting

Hi guys, 
I have been a smoker for around 27 years and on average I would smoke about a pack per day. Since Sunday, I have reduced that amount to about 3-6 cigarettes per day and haven't been feeling the urge or "cravings" to smoke, but I've been suffering panic attacks several times a day with no triggers. I'm not normally an anxious person and I'm worrying about these side-effects. Has anyone else experienced this whilst trying to quit? How long does it last for? Any advice would be appreciated.

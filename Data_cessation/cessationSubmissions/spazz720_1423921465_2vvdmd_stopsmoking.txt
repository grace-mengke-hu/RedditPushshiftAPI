Set my quit date...

March 1st is my quit date. Been a pack a day smoker for 15 years. Tried vaping before, and didn't work. Going all in cold turkey. What the fucking hell can I expect to mentally prepare myself...All cold turkey quitters advice is accepted and any tips to help in dealing with the social problems and routine issues sure to come up; will be greatly appreciated.

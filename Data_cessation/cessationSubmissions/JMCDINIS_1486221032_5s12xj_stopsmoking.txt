One day and failed

I was planned to stop smoking two days ago... Yesterday was supposed to be my first day smoke free. I planned on going cold turkey but having an e-cigarette that a friend was going to lend me. But she forgot it and I spent the whole day thinking of it. And then I talked to a friend of mine and I said I'd stop on Monday, when I got the e-cig. And I smoked that afternoon, and the whole night... I ashamed because I was so confident I'd be able to go those hardest 72 hours, that I'd be as strong as so many people here, but I made up an excuse for myself...

I'm don't wan to be selfish, I hope I'm not bringing anyone down, or take your hope and strength away. I don't want anyone to read this and give in too. Don't be weak like I was.

But I keep asking, is it worth it? I know it is, but I just see myself making up excuses and delaying it.

But I'll try again. And again. And if I need, again. Because I want to stop, I really do. I told a couple of friends of mine, I created a Support group chat for if I need motivation, I installed a Smoke Free app, and I keep telling my self that *That one more cig you want, it* ***WILL*** *hurt*. I know I want to stop. I just need to tell myself that.

Had an Asthma Attack

I started smoking 3 years ago and for the last one year I was smoking around a pack a day.
I had been coughing a lot for the last week and 4 nights ago I had an asthma attack in the night at 3 am. I was lucky there's a hospital nearby, 5 min walking distance from my apartment. I barely walked to the hospital sitting at the sidewalk every other minute, when I reached the hospital the doctor told me I had very high blood pressure and an asthma attack.
I am really scared because I'm just 22 and I had this.
I want to tell you guys that I have given up smoking and the attack was like a wake up call for me. But now, the doctor has told me to always keep my inhaler with me wherever I go. It feels so bad right now that meaningless cigarettes gave this to me. 
Don't wait for anything, a good moment to give it up, less problems around you, or a wake up call. 
I have to live with asthma for the rest of my life.

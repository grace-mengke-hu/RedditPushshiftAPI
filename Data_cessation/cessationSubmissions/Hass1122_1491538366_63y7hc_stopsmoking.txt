More than 2 weeks still depression?

Hey guys today is my 16th day, I stopped cold turkey after 4 years of heavy smoking and my brain fog is still heaps bad but today it feels like it has worn off a little bit and I still feel extremely sad all the time, has anyone went through this? How long will this last, even now I wake up craving for a cigarette and in a really bad mood all the time I wanna feel normal again but without smoking any help will be greatly appreciated guys thank you!

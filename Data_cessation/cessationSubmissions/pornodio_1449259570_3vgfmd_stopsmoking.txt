today it's the day I stop for good

I've been experimenting in the last 2 months with nicotine patches, and they work wonders on me except on the weekends when I have nothing to do (I have no social life where I live now) when sometimes I fall back into the habit. But I've been having enough time to notice how shit cigarettes are and how much better life without cigarettes is. About to smoke my last cigarette. I threw away the whole pack I bought today that I fell again, but this time I don't feel any  remorse for throwing that shit away. I will be using the patches as a crutch but just because I really must do it otherwise my body starts sending me false signals. Goodbye forever poison

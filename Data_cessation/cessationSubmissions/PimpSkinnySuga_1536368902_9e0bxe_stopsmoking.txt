Heart palpitations???

Guys please help, im 3 days clean, entering the 4th day, for the past few days my heart has been pounding like crazy, when it first happened i thought i was gonna die, i ended up vomiting... next day after that (which was yesterday) same palpitations but no vomiting thankfully, please please tell me that this will end soon because im losing my mind, its painful.... i was considering relapsing today just to rid off these palpitations, but no wtf smoking cannot be my medicine.
I read somewhere someone said that they had these palpitations for more than 8 months after quitting, I dont think i can handle 8 months?!!?!!!?

ExSmoker almost 4 years

Based on the success my mother-in-law had, my wife and I had Scopolamine injections to stop smoking.

There is surprisingly little info out there, but it does indeed work.

We both slept for a couple of days afterward and we had blurry vision for the rest of the week. IIRC correctly it was around $900 for both of us.

It does indeed work.

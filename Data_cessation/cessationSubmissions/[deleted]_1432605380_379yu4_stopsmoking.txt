Tips when travelling? It's a weakness of mine.

I am seven days in and doing just fine. I am a little worried because tomorrow I am going to New York City, and I anticipate temptation. You see, I was six months free, very confident that smoking was behind me, when I traveled to Paris. Lots of smokers there, made it feel like part of the Paris lifestyle. Got a little bored, so what did I do? Had a smoke. Still can't believe it. It took me another three months of on and off smoking to get back to this place I am now. Only 7 days, but feeling strong. Still, a little nervous that travel will put me in a different space, weakened to temptation. Any tips when travelling?

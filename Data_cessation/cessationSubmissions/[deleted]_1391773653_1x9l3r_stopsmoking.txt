Day 3 night out. On smokeless drinking.

After 10 years I am on day 3. Maybe foolishly but I went out for a drink. With my girlfriend only not with a big crowd.

And there I had 2 beers. Talking silently. Craving here and there. Alcohol makes it worse, so in the end I was really biting my nails for the poison.

We went home and I thought about what would have happened if i smoked. 
1 while drinking the first, 1 after finishing it, while going to order the second, 1 before finishing the second beer, I would have ordered a third beer just to smoke some more.  1 at the middle of the third, and 1 on the way home. 

3-4 times I would have been standing in the cold (smoking is prohibited indoors) with my girlfriend freezing next to me, or even alone. Not to be seen like a slave I would have pretended it was such a special night that I have to smoke this much. I wouldn't have even realized I was controlled by nicotine.

By the time I would have arrived home I would have coughed and felt like my lungs are full and yet empty. Taking deep breaths, thinking about quitting. 

It is unbelievably good to be a nonsmoker. Cravings are bad. But man... this is something different. It is good to be free of it.

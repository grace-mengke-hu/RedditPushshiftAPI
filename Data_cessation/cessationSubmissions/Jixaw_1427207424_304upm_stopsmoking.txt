I love you guys.

Like, seriously. Everyone on this subreddit deserves a big thank you. We all know how mean reddit can be But you guys are all just awesome. I would not have made it this far if it wasn't for you guys. And that's not just a compliment. I'm serious about that. 

Im 21 days in now, and had some cravings, but this subreddit always... ALWAYS makes them go away. Thank you so much people! I love all of you. Good luck to everyone who's quitting together with me! 

Also, if anyone is lurking and is afraid to share his/her feelings, don't be! Everyone here is in this together. :)

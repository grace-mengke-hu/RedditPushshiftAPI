Cigarette free for about 2 months now, having problems being around smoke

I stopped smoking recently and switched to just vaping. I went out with my buddy last night for a going away party and we chilled in a pretty closed-off bar, he and all his friends smoked and I had to either breathe in their smoke or go outside, and obviously I stayed. Fast forward to this morning, and I feel like I can't breathe enough air. My question is, are there any lung exercises or products I could try to alleviate this feeling? Thanks in advance.

Trying hard not to smoke!

So I was supposed to be 4 day smoke free, but I hit a snag, had some horrible nightmares yesterday and smoked a few cigarettes, had the same nightmare and had 1 smoke this morning. I'm going to a bike rally and half my friends knows that I stopped smoking and drinking, so this weekend is going to be tough as hell. Any ideas on what I can do to survive the torment of lighting again?

100 Days? Awesome!

I just want to say thanks to all of you guys here at StopSmoking, you've been a massive help to me on my journey. The days are going by so fast, and I no longer even think about smoking. I know that some of you may be reading this and thinking that a hundred days is a long time, but it's gone so quick that I can't believe it.

Once again thanks for all of the support, and good luck to all of you!

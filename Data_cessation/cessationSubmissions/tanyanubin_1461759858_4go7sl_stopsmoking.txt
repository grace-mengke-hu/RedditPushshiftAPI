I stopped a 2-pack a day habit over 33 years ago. I was hospitalized for a bad asthmatic bronchitis. I quit at that point because...it was stupid to continue. I quit cold turkey. First few weeks were tough, and I dreamed about smoking for several years. My wisdom? Stop putting it into your mouth. Just stop. Just like AA says, "it's not easy but it's simple." Couldn't be truer. My sister got pregnant with twins through IVF 22 years ago...couldn't get herself to stop. I told her the same thing- "just don't put it in your mouth, whatever you do." For some reason, that worked for her. i had quit years earlier...lasted 2 years, until I lit a cigarette for someone. That started me again for 10 years. Don't do stupid things like that. This is hard. really hard. But it's doable. You CAN do it. Just don't put it in your mouth and you're there.

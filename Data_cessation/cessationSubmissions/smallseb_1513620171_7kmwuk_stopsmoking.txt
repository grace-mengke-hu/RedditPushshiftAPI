Knowing it won't change anything but...

Something tough is happening in my life right now. I was trying to find a way around this weekend but couldn't and I probably won't be able to change anything. 

More than once for the past 3 days I have been wanting to smoke. 
This is basically the first "real" craving I have since I've stopped smoking. 

You might have experienced similar situation. What did you do to get your head off that? Since this situation will last, how to make sure that the smoking addiction somewhere in my brain won't bother me all day long ?

I know that smoking won't change my situation. I guess I am looking for the comfort and peacefulness I did found before, when I was smoking, in real shitty days. 
What would you do?

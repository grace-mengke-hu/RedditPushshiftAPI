Day five - managed to get a good night's sleep

Today marks the fifth day of my quit. 
I actually feel pretty good right now. I've been up for an hour, had breakfast and coffee, and haven't had a craving yet. Thankfully, I was able to sleep well for the first time since I quit. I get mad insomnia from quitting.

The weekend is about to start, which usually means going out for drinks. However, I think I'll just stay at home this weekend. I have quit three times before, and three times relapsed due to alcohol.

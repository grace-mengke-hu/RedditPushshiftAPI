Buying Vape for Mom, Help?

Mom's a lifelong smoker.  She's willing to give a vaporizer a try.  I've done a little research on good entry-level vapes.  The Vision Spinner is in my price range and seems to be what I want.  

Is that worth it?  Or do you have another recommendation?  

Also, I know jack all about vapes.  Where's a good place to order them?  Amazon doesn't seem to keep a good stock.  And how do I find the right kind of e-liquid?  It needs nicotine.  

I don't smoke, and I'm pretty much utterly ignorant of all this, so any help would be much appreciated.  Thank you.

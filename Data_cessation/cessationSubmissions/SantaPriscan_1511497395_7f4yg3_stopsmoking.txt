I have one more cigarette left in my pack, might at well smoke it and quit before midnight on Thanksgiving.

I had an attempt on my PTO but rationalized continuing smoking. I learned that my office is moving and I have no car; I will be forced to run to work from now on. Let's have another go at this folks! The remaining work week shouldn't be too stressful. For now I'm focusing on making it three days and I will take it in small increments.

Edit: Haven't visited this subreddit that much after my previous failure; requested a badge removal just now and I will add a new one.

New Years Resolution.

My New Year’s resolution was to quit smoking. Unfortunately I didn’t make it the day and had some cigarettes yesterday, a few today also.

But I’m not giving up. 

I’m here to tell you that just because it’s January 2 doesn’t mean you still can’t make it your resolution to quit this year. We can do it guys!

Happy New Year!

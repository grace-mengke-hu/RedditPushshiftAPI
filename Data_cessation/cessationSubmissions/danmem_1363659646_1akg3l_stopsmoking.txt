My third day smoke free

Hey guys.  I just want to say this subreddit is a great idea and means to support each other.  This is my third day smoke free after a three quarter pack a day addiction I have had since 14.  My goal is to never have a cigarette again.  I have been smoking irregularly for the past month and stupidly holding on to my addiction by smoking once every two weeks,  let's try and stop that :)  (fucking alcohol).  Anyway, this is still the best I have gone so far and good luck to everyone else that is stopping this god forsaken slavery.

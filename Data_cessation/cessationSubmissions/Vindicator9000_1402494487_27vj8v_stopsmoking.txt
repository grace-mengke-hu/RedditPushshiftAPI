Hey, 100 days!

When I joined this sub, I was desperate.  I was having a really terrible time.  I've done a bit of posting about it the terrible, crushing depression and violent thoughts (not to mention the terrible physical discomfort) that the several weeks of quitting were causing me.  


If you would have asked me then, I never would have thought I'd make it to 100 days.  I assumed that at some point, it would be too much, and I'd pick up cigs again.  


I can't say exactly why I didn't.  It was a combination of lots of factors: a knowledge that if I started again, I would just have to go through the torture again later.  Alan Carr helped quite a bit, but despite what he says, I'll say that I've never in my life done anything harder than this.


I also think that a lot of my success was because I was seeing other people here who had gone through terrible quits like I was, but were now happy, supportive, and STILL QUIT.  It helped me counteract my brain screaming that these feeling would never go away without smoking.  Thank you all.


In retrospect, I've gained some new personal knowledge about myself.  I've discovered that:

* I had been suffering from low-level depression for a long time.

* The depression was greatly enhanced by quitting.

* The depression was (surprise!!) CAUSED largely by the smoking!


Yes friends, I discovered that a lot of the cynical, 'don't give a shit about anything' attitude that I've had since about age 15 was caused by dealing with the cognative dissonance of paying to kill myself, plus constant withdrawals from refusing to smoke as much as I really wanted.  The only real cure was to quit the shit for good.


So, thanks again to everyone, just for being here.  Reading your posts has helped me immensely.

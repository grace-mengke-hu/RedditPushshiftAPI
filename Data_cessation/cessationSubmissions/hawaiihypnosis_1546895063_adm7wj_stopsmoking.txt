How smoking dragged my sex drive down to a screeching halt

Thankfully I quit smoking about four years ago.  I didn't realize how bad smoking was affecting my sexual health.

Talking about being winded after only a little bit of action.

Not to mention never being able to bounce back like in my twenties or 30s.

I tried to chalk up my weak erections (and not being able to jump into a second round) as natural changes as I got older.  

After I quit smoking at 36 years old, my sex drive started to fire up again.  I could go for another round and my stamina shot through the roof. 

So if you're struggling to kick the habit - or you're in the grip of a monster sized craving - remember there is a big pay off :)

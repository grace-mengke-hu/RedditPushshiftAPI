Day 3: What do you guys do to get rid of the cravings when drinking?

I'm on day 3 smoke-free and loving all the changes - especially in regards to smell. My car stinks less, my girlfriend complains less about how I smell and overall I just feel great. Toothpicks have been helping a great deal for me, as the oral fixation is the hardest part to get over for me. 

Tonight however, is my friend's birthday. We're going out to a club, and I'm scared of how alcohol is going to effect my withdrawals. Any tips on what you guys do when the cravings come with the alcohol? I'm bringing my trusty vape with me if worst comes to worst, but I don't want to pull it out too often due to the fact that vaporizers have a negative stigma for some reason. I know the best method would be not to drink, but it's my first Saturday off in months and I want to have a couple with my friends tonight!

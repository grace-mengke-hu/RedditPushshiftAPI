How I feel immediately after reading Allen Carr's book

I literally just finished it, threw my cigarettes away and took a long hot shower.  I feel like I understand the "little monster" in my stomach and that I can't feed it anymore.  I also feel like the nicotine withdrawals won't be noticeable or as severe as I imagined.  I will embrace each and every "pang" until they are gone and I reach my "revelation".  I will not be checking or responding to this post as I do not want any negative reviews to hinder my becoming of a non-smoker but I will follow up in 1 month.  Just wanted to give my quick 2 cents on the book.

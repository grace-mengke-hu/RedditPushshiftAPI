I'm doing it, gonna quit!

I started smoking when I was bartending, it was the only way to get a break and deal with the stress. I still work in a high stress job, at least outside of the restaurant business. 

I was always active in high school and college, running regularly, playing sports, and now I'm too out of shape from smoking for the things I loved to do. I used to justify smoking to deal with the stress of my job. But it's also pretty stressful when your clothes are too tight because you're too out of shape to go to the gym... 

Tomorrow is my quit day. I'd appreciate words of encouragement!

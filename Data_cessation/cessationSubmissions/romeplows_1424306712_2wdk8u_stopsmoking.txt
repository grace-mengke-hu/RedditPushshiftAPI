First time trying

Hey all, just started my first venture into quitting smoking (hopefully for good) today as I decided to give it up for lent. I have an e-cig to hopefully limit some of the negative effects of withdrawal, and all of my friends/roommates are really supportive which is a great thing. Anyone have any tips for someone trying to quit for the first time? Anything would be appreciated, I really want this break to be for good. Thanks everyone

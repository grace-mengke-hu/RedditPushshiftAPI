I want to stop smoking now!!!

Here some background, i'm a smoker since 14 yrs old. Now i'm 24 and i want to quit. Everyday i woke up and before i brush my teeth i buy a pack, for god sakes, every fucking day. i can't stop. Maybe i'm more than addicted ? please help, i don't wanna doctors to help me. I just want to stop this obsession about cigarretes. I already tried everything, nothing works. I want to stop now.

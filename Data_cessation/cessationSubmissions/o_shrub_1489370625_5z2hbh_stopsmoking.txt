So happy to find this community!

Had an intense and unexpected craving the day before yesterday-- surprising because the cravings had diminished over the second week. So I'm realizing the release from addiction won't be linear, and I may well need your help over the coming weeks and months. This is my first concerted effort-- the "2" resulted from a typo.

First time out drinking without smoking!

Hi all!
Still going strong over here. Wen't out drinking both Friday and Saturday this weekend for some friends visiting but didn't have any cigarettes whatsoever. There was a few others smoking around but I found that the best way to not smoke was first to inhale through the nose then exhale through the mouth for a few times and second, just hang out with the non smokers mainly. The cravings will and did pass.

Also didn't really feel hungover the day after. Cigarettes used to make those so. much. worse.

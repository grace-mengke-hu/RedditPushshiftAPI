4 weeks was last Saturday, one month is today!

Super excited! Shout out to the handful of people I've found in this sub with the same quit date as me. And thanks to everyone else for the motivation!

Update:
• I haven't taken Zyban in the last two days and hasn't changed anything regarding my quit being easier or more difficult.
• I also have a cold and, strangely, I'm excited to experience being sick without smoking. 
• I keep losing count of the days! 

Keep on keepin' on, everyone!!

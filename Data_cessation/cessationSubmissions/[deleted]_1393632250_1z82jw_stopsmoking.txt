Keep going!

I quit smoking cigarettes almost 3 years ago now and I just want to offer some words of encouragement to those people who are finding it tough to quit, it really will truly be worth all your effort and struggle! 

So, keep going! Even if you fail and start smoking again, don't worry about it, just learn from it and try again! Eventually you will learn the best way to give up the cigarettes once and for all!

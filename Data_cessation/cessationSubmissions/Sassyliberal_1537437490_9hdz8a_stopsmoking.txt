Does anybody else experience intense rage even a couple hours after your last smoke?

Every time I try to stop, within 2 hours I'm an emotional wreck.. Full of anger one minute, in tears the next. Then I have a smoke and my whole body feels instantly sedated and I can use my brain properly again

I called my mum and she said she's never known anyone to react like I do when I stop, which makes me think I'm a fuck up to be honest. I am to an extent theres no denying that, but I hate feeling like I'm on a whole other level of pathetic with these withdrawals...

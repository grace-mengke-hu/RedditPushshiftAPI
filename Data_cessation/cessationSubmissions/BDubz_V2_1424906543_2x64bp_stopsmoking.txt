Day 4 - Tips and Strategies So Far

Hello All -

  Day 4 of Cold Turkey, smoked for 13 years.  Things that have helped so far -

* lots of Advil.  Just generally cuts down on the cravings/headaches/whatever.  And of course water.
* Not giving cravings so much credit.  They last for like 3.5 minutes, aren't really that strong (won't wake you up), and I'm an adult. You can handle a 3.5 minute craving, averaging 6 a day at their absolute worst.
* Time your cravings.  It's funny to see they don't last that long. 
* Visualize.  Actually visualize driving to work without smoking.  Wrapping up dinner and not smoking.  Whatever the trigger is, visualize not smoking, down to what you'll be wearing. 
* Realizing people won't give you credit for quitting.  You're just getting back to what 72% of people don't do, I don't talk about it all the time.
* Enjoy the breathing, and not weezing at random times. I hated stairs because I knew it would take 15 minutes to recover, and if I was with a group of strangers, I would be the only person weezing and breathing weird.  Not anymore.

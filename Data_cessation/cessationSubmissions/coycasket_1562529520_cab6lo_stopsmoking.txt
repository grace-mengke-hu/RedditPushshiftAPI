What is your experience with NRT?

I've been trying to quit on and off for months now. I went smoke free for 4 months earlier this year then broke. Since then I've been having an incredibly hard time sticking to it. I went a week without buying a pack then broke last night.

I think I need to try something new... NRT?

 What is your experience with adding NRT's into your quit plan?

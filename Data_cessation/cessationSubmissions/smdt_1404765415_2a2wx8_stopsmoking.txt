alan carr?

has anyone else read alan carr's book the easyway to quit? a friend recommended it to me and at first i thought it was gonna be a pile of shit but actually really helped me quit, didnt smoke for 2 weeks. but then i had one fag and am now back to smoking properly. i dont know if i should try reading the book again or if it only helps once! or i might just embrace being a smoker .... does anyone have any advice re rereading alan carr? or any other motivational books or films or whatever? gaaaah smoking why did any of us start?!?!

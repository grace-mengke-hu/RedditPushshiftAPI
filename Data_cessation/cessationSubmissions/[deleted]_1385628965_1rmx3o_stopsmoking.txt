Did your willpower increase after quitting?

Ahoi fellow quitters! I hope you are doing well!

I've read somewhere that quitting increases your willpower. I'd like to hear some thoughts on this question.

For myself I think it holds true.  I think my "willpower reserves" increasing slightly but most of all I believe I'm a better judge of when to focus and practice self restrain and when to relax.

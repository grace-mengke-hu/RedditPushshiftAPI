I am trying

I am trying I am trying I am trying. I am listening to Allen Carr's book. I'm taking in what is being said. I am finding the strength to love myself enough to quit. I know what wrong with me, my depression makes me think I deserve this evil curse. How do you explain that to people? That it's not that you're not strong enough, it's that you don't love yourself. I can't even say I love myself enough, that would imply that there was/is love, to begin with.  

But I don't want my SO mad at me anymore. I don't want to lie to anyone anymore. I don't even want to think about it anymore. It's an endless cycle of anxiety but I am trying. I'm posting here in this subreddit. I want to desperately reach out to so many people. I've been through so much. But I can't do it all at once so here I am trying to quit. Trying to start with something. I'm even going to go so far to say that even right now I'm debating about deleting this, like so many other posts for help.

I don't even know what I'm asking for. Or if I even am asking for anything. I have so many issues but I don't want smoking to be one of them. I'm sorry for posting this and probably making no sense, I'm just having a really hard time. I don't even know if I will respond to anyone. I want to but the anxiety just goes crazy and I get scared. I'm always so scared and I don't even know what I'm scared of.

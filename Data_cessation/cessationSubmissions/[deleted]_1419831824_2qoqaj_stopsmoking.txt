How can I approach a friend who is starting to smoke?

I have a friend who just turned 18.  He basically has two groups of friends, the group which I am a part of is your typical crowd, we party like teenagers and whatnot but know our limits.  The other group is a more "redneck" crowd.  To say the least, they aren't the best influence.  He picked up dipping from them a while ago, and is already hooked.  None of the people in my group approved, but we let it happen.

Now that he's 18, he is able to get his own tobacco, and he seems to be actively trying to smoke more.  I'd guess he's smoking maybe 2-4 cigarettes a day, but he clearly has no plans of stopping.  I've been actively expressing my disapproval toward him with smoking much more than I did with drinking, which I feel is an okay start, but will probably just make him angry in the long run.  I want him to know I genuinely care about him and am not just giving him a hard time for fun.  I'm thinking maybe telling his parents could be a good plan, but don't want to escalate this more than necessary.  I really have no perspective of what goes through a smoker's head.  What should I do here?

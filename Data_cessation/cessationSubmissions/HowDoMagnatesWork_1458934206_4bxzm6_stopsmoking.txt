This happen to anyone else?

I don't know about the rest of you, but lately I have few, if any, cravings in the morning.  Then, after lunch, they come back with a vengeance to the point that I have trouble concentrating, I'm afraid I'll throw my mouse through my computer monitor, etc.  Don't know what's up with that.  Seems to have happened all week, without fail.  I know it'll pass if I keep riding it out, but it's starting to irritate me a wee bit.

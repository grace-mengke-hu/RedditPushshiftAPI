I'm ready to stop.

I'm reading the sidebar and perusing posts. If anyone has any anecdotes, other info, or advice please comment below.

I cut back to only smoking at bars, but I play on a pool leauge so I'm at a bar 2-3 nights a week. I'm tired of it. I got hooked bad in college because it was a social thing and an anxiety thing. I'm so tired of that. I'm way more socially capable than needing that now. It's a hindrance not a help

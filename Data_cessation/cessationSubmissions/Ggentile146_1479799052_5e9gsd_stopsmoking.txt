I quit smoking 4 years ago for about 2 years and for some dumb reason I started smoking again. I'm hoping this is the end, I'm just scared it's going to make my anxiety worse. I just got done reading that smoking enables anxiety and depression so hopefully things go smoothly. Wish me luck! There are a lot of positive people here and that definitely makes me feel better. Good luck to all that are quiting!!

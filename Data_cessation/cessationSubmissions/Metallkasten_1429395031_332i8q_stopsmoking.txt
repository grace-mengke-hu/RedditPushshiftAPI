8 months

Hey all! I thought I would share. This is my first time here. I just got an email from my boss reminding me I quit about 8 months ago. Why does she care? My job offers a $1000 bonus for it. I quit using an e cig for about two months. Hopefully I won't ever have to think about smoking or quitting again. Good luck guys!

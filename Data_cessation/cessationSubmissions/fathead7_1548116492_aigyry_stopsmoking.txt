Looking for an accountability buddy, preferably local, for texting, maybe meeting up to go for a jog? Irvine, CA. Quitting tomorrow.

My friends either smoke, or they don’t. None of them are trying to quit at the moment, so I’m looking for someone preferably local to quit with me and we can hold each other accountable and motivate each other. 34/m in Irvine, CA.

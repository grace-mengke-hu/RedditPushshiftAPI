I smoked today BUT

So I was very stressed(PMDD can rot in hell) so I lit up but I was honestly so disgusted by it I put it out after a couple of drags. This is the first time the Allen Carr method has gone through to me.  Smoking doesn’t do anything for me except make me smell like an ashtray and if I’m having a shitty day, it’s going to be shitty regardless if I smoke or not. Tomorrow I’m stocking up on cranberry juice, snacks and gum.

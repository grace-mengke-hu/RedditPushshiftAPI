1 month down and a pretty scary dream last night

Yay 1 month!! 
and not so yay to this dream I had last night. In my dream I was coughing up chunks of tar, and I noticed blood in the chunks. I was mortified. If that's not a reason to keep on keeping on then I don't know what is. I'm so happy to be where I am today, and I can't wait for the months/years ahead.

Keep strong everyone!

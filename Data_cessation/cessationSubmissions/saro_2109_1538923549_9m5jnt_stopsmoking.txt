Close Call

I was incredibly drunk the other night, and my friends and I ended up at a hookah bar where another one of our friends works. I've never wanted nicotine so badly in my life... luckily my girlfriend was there (and sober) and knew better than to let me smoke. Gotta try to avoid those situations.

I've only been smoking for about 2 months and want to stop but really enjoy it as it helps curb anxiety I'm facing.

Hello "non-smokers", as my title stated I am definitely in a better position to quit than others as I do not face withdraws or irritation when I go three or so days without smoking. I smoke 2-4 cigarettes a day but often will go a day or two without picking one up. The problem I having with quitting is not with a physical dependency but more of an emotional dependency.

About 5 months ago I relocated to a new city for my first real job after college. Two months ago I started to get stressed out quite a bit and lonely in my new city and I recalled relaxation being a positive side effect of smoking. So I started casually smoking because I really enjoyed the fuzziness and blankness that smoking brought with it. Its a 5 minute vacation from my stress and anxiety every time I smoke, but I'm sure I don't need to explain that to many of you.

For New Years I decided I wanted to quit, you know, no better time to quit than at the start of a new year. I slowed down for a few days but then picked up the pack again yesterday wanting a "vacation". That led to me smoking again today. 

I'm afraid my emotional dependency is going to make it difficult to quit. Its seems like many of you have found success here, so I'm reaching out to you all for advice. I want to quit for good, its a bad habit and unhealthy.

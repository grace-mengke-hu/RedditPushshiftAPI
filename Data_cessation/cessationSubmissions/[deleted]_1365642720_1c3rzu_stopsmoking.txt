Light headedness

I'm almost done with day three. I was never a heavy smoker (rarely more than 4 a day). I've noticed that today and yesterday whenever I stand up I get very light headed and feel like I might pass out. Is this a common symptom of quitting? Maybe because of the vasoconstrictor aspect of nicotine wearing off?

Dunno, just something I've noticed.

Winning. (A love story)

Two years.

Two years without taking a drag.  Without tobacco.

Two.  Years.

It wasn't that long ago that I was a slave to the cravings.  A slave to going outside in the ravaging cold, or the blistering heat.  All-weather, here.  Sneaking outside during the small amount of time I had with my wife.  Cowering in fear if I didn't have my beloved smokes at my side.  Running out at 2AM during a social event to the nearest gas station to pick up my fix.    

My car no longer smells like smoke.  My hair, my clothes, my apartment.  I no longer feel the urge when I see people smoking in movies, on the street, on television.  It's completely gone, like a distant dream or a passing memory.  Sometimes I remember, sometimes I dream that I am smoking.  It hurts when I wake up.  I feel it in my heart, my lungs, somewhere deep inside my emotional being.

But I haven't given up.

Stressers have come and gone.  Triggers have developed and waned.  Time has passed.  My whole family smokes with wild abandon, but it doesn't phase me.  The wound has closed.  

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking, for what you did for me.   This subreddit brought me solace in the times of need.  When I felt as if I needed to go back, someone's words told me otherwise.

For those of you who are trying to quit:  it's possible.  Stick to it.  Find a way that works for you.  It's not a 'one size fits all'.  No book, cessation, e-cig, or anything else is going to help if you do not WANT to quit.  It's in your head.  You do not NEED to smoke.  You do not HAVE to smoke. You feel like you do, right now.  Soon, that feeling will ebb, return, and wane again.  

Stay strong.  Here's to 2+ years smoke free.  And many, many more.

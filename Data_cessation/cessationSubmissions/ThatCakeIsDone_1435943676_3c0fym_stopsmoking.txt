Forced to quit.

Engineering major here, just found out my dream career, who is moving forward with the hiring process, is going to give me a physical screen for nicotine (among other substances) and will rescind their offer if I test positive.

Needless to say I quit smoking as soon as I found out, and am on day 2. I feel so much more confident than at any other time I have tried to quit, because my livelihood depends on it. Cravings come and go, and I can get very tense sometimes and all I can think about is a smoke, but if I ride it out, I can remind myself that this is the most important thing I can do right now.

Wish me luck!

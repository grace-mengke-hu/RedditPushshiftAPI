Day 4

Started splurging my thoughts out on here since my third day when I found this sub-reddit (kinda like a bit of a blog/diary thing): http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/38hwa6/third_day/.

Anywho...

Day 4 

Went out for drinks last night with friends. Although I was tempted to smoke on several occasions I took 4-5 minutes, go to the bathroom and just remind myself that "the pleasure I would get from a cigarette now would only be temporary" "to have one now would be worthless compared to a lifetime without them". I felt good on the way home!

I have a festival coming up in August, and will have been 3~ months smoke free by then. I will be drinking but part of me thinks "you're probably going to smoke then, so why not just not bother quitting". 

I'm kinda looking for some closure. I'm pretty strong mentally now, but the last time I tried to quit I was suffering pretty badly with depression and anxiety from quitting. I'm in a much better position now though. Do any of you guys continue to have negative thoughts about relapse after months of smoking? If so, what is your way of dealing with them?

What keeps you going?

Hi r/stopsmoking! I quit smoking on New Year's Day after feeling very rough from the night before. Conveniently I was sick for about 10 days after with a virus which really helped as I had absolutely no desire to smoke over this period. About two weeks in, I decided to buy an electronic cigarette for when I'm at a bar or in situations where I would badly crave a cigarette as a backup incase I caved. I haven't really been using it, but recently I have had serious cravings, particularly when stressed. 

Today I was told I may be made redundant in my workplace and I was also unsuccessful at my application to university which got me thinking, what is the best thing to tell yourself when on the brink of smoking? What motivates you to keep away from having a cigarette? And in particular is there something you do to prevent it when you're super stressed/angry etc?

 I'm at a stage now where I'm almost convincing myself that it wasn't that bad and I miss them a lot. The social aspect in particular is very tough for me as almost all of my friends smoke. Any help appreciated!

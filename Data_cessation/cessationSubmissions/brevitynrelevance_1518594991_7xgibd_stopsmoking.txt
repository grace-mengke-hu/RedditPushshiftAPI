If I start smoking again, I will donate to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign

I’ve been smoke free for over a month now, and I’ve saved about $100. 

I told myself that if I started smoking again I’d have to donate all the money I’ve saved to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. This has been very motivating when I’m jonesing to smoke. 

Here are some other organizations/people I’d consider donating to if I start smoking again:
Paul Ryan’s re-election campaign 
The Westboro Baptist Church 
My local KKK chapter 
The NRA 
The National Right to Life Committee 
The Heritage Foundation 

Of course as a liberal democrat this works as an incentive for me. But if your political views differ, consider donating to these groups if you start smoking again:
Planned Parenthood 
NARAL 
The ACLU
NAACP
The Sierra Club 

Best of luck to you in your quitting journey!

I just threw up.

After a few months of bumming a cigarette here and there last year, I started smoking more regularly November-December to get through finals. Finals came and went and I found myself smoking even more December-January. 
Today is my 20th birthday and I decided to stop. I got myself some 14 mg nicotine patches and put one on. About 10 minutes in it was itchy, 20 min my arm got colder and I felt like I would after one cig, and 30min I was cold sweating. I started getting nauseous and went to lay down but  at 45 I was throwing up and ripped off the patch. 
On the one hand I feel really gross and don't want to touch another patch, but on the other I'm not as dependent as I thought so I guess that's good. 
This is my first time actually trying to quit so if anyone has any suggestions or stories of things that helped them I'd love to hear them. 
Sorry for the long post, I'm just feeling gross and thought I'd share.

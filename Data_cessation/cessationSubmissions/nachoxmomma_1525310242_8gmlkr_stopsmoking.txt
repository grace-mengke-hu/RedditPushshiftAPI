Damn finals.

I'm 11 days smoke free and very proud of that. The only thing I'm struggling with is that it's the end of the semester and I have a million and half assignments/projects/exams due and all I want to have a moment of solitude is to sit on my porch and have a smoke. I'm finding it really hard to not reach for a cigarette and I can't understand why I can't just let it go. Up until a few days ago I was having no problems resisting my cravings, but now I'm thinking of of the "good" it will bring me and ignoring all the bad.

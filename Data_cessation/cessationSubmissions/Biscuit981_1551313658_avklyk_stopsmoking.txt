Just starting...

I’m addicted to vaping, and I’ve been using the highest nicotine products the whole time. I’ve quit for 1-2 day periods before, but I’ve never committed. Any tips on how to get started? Should I try lowering nic content, taking longer periods between using it, or just quit cold turkey? How can I stay committed?

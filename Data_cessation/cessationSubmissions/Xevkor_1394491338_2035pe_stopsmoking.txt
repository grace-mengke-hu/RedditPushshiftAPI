17 days....

It has been 17 days, 6 hours, and 25 minutes....I just woke up one day, smoked one final cigarette in my daily habitual routine after I woke up getting ready for work.

I didn't smoke the rest of the day - the cravings was bad, very bad. I've never craved something so bad before in my entire life.

I had to find something to replace my habit. 

I turned to vaping, I found a kit online, a starter kit - and have been using it for a little over two weeks now. I did try to smoke a cigarette one time; it was the worst tasting, gut wrenching feeling I have had in a long time. I took 2 puffs of it, and threw it out, and I truly loved my  marlboro blacks.

Ive smoked for 5 years, and 17 days ago, I quit smoking cigarettes.
Maybe I can quit the nicotine once and for all, but as of right now, the vaping is doing me really well, and I'm not smoking or spending as much as I did with cigarettes.

As of this hour, I have saved 104$ by not smoking. 

I've been lurking this sub-reddit for a couple months now, and decided to post, regardless if I am using a vaping method, or if I will receive any backlash for using it. As far as it goes, one day I will quit everything all together, but mostly the success stories on here gave me an extra push, and I read them constantly. 

Keep up the good work everyone!

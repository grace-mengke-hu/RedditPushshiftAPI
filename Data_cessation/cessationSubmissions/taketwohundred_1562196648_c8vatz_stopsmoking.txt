One year and a few days in and I feel like I can finally stop counting!

For everyone just starting or going through a tough spot, hang in there. It definitely gets easier and it's really worth it. Kicking the habit gives me freedom from an addiction, but I also take great satisfaction in building up the discipline that allowed me to actually kick it. The discipline to say no more cigs, to say no to the triggers when they happened, to push myself to meditate more to help understand my head space. All of this has really made me realise I can be a disciplined person and I can push through other challenging situations successfully.

Physically, I don't really notice any changes since my last update. The only thing I can think of is that I have fewer smoking related dreams now. That's about it. I think I'm going to stop counting and probably will not post any more updates unless something significant happens. Good luck to everyone! Be kind to yourselves but be disciplined!

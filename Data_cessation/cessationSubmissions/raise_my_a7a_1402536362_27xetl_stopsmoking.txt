i have no idea, but its happening and this is my day no. 8 :)))

I have been struggling for years now to quit and never once did, this is my 1st time in 15 years to stop smoking and its my 1st day after the week already???!, alan carr said it and somehow it was stuck in my brain, that quiting is not only easy but enjoyable and yes it is, everytime i think that its been a while since i smoked my "last nicotine thing" i get excited like i scored a 3 pointer at a buzzer haha....thank you r/stopsmoking greetings from egypt.

Share your weird and wonderful side effects of quitting!

I'm on day 11 and have been having some weird and lovely symptoms and side effects.
First week I was cross and emotional and getting nasty chest pains. Eating so much food it was pretty much self harm. I ate a giant mega box of cinnamon grahams, bowl after bowl until there were none left. Spent a fortune on 'treats' to motivate me. 
But this week... 
I have so much energy! I've been running home from work and I am desperate for an exercise bike because I can't sit still. At first it was a kind of unpleasant nervous energy, I felt so bored and uncomfortable but now I've mellowed out a bit it's quite nice. Been trying to use the extra energy to get stuff done. Hope it lasts.
Also Im sleeping better.
My hair feels cleaner and nicer.
Looked down today at my hands properly and no yellow nails :)
Mouth doesn't taste horrible when I wake up.
So many lovely things to get used to! I've smoked longer than I haven't so this feels like the first time I've had these things!
Also smoker breath does not smell like what it feels like it does (partner still smokes) it smells sour and pickled and burnt. Really quite revolting. 

How about everyone else out there?

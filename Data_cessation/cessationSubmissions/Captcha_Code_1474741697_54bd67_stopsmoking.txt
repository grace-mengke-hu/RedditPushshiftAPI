Just found out I am pregnant... Need to quit as soon as possible. Please assist in safe methods.

I smoke half a pack a day, minimum, sometimes a full pack a day on the weekends. I found out I was pregnant yesterday and I need to kick this habit immediately. I tried going complete cold turkey yesterday but around hour eight I was literally making my mouth bleed because I was putting so much suction on my gums. I was also having obsessive thoughts and eventually went outside and smoked a disgusting mostly smoked cigarette butt in my ash tray. 

I can probably do about four per day immediately, but that's not good enough. I need to quit 100%. How to kick those last few cigarettes out of the day? It's 2:30pm here and woke up at 9. Smoked one first thing when I woke up and then another just a few minutes ago. I'll probably have another after dinner and one before bed.

Really, really need to kick it soon, and now that I have some drive to do so, I think it'll be easier. Just need to know how to deal with the intense cravings.

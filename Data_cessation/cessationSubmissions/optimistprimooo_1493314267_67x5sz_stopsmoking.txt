2 weeks tomorrow, & every day has gotten harder.

Quit smoking two weeks ago tomorrow. Smoked a pack a day for 8 years, stopped cold turkey. The last three times I have gotten a cold over the past year & a half, I would end up with 2 weeks of wheezing & bronchitis afterwards. I couldn't be using an inhaler & then go out to smoke a cigarette. I could only lie to myself so much, so I figured it was time to stop.

Problem is, each day seems worse & worse. The first couple of days, I virtually had no cravings. Seems like after I hit the 5 day mark, the cravings get worse & worse each day. I'm afraid I'm going to break & end up smoking again. The only thing stopping me is the idea of having to reset my counter, but the cravings are getting so bad that I am afraid that won't stop me in a few days. I actually feel like I'm less happy without cigarettes. Any advice? Best way to change my mindset? Any help/motivation is sincerely appreciated. Y'all quitting are heroes, this shit is tough & no joke.

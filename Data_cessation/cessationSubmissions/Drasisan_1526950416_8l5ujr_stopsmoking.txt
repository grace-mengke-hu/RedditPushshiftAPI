God Dammit, I failed! Let's pick it up again.

AGggGHhHH! I started to smoke again like 3 months ago after a 2 months and half no smoking streak. 

It was my first time I ever tried and went so far... Just the office stress and life stress made go back to it. 

So well, guessing it's time to start again. 
Let's do this!

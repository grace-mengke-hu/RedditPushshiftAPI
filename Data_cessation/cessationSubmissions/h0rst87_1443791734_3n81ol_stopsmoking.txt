Trying again, this time feels better

So I've tried a couple of times to quit but with no avail.

This time im using a vape with a small amount of nicotine (3mg) and its fantastic...big thing with them is to get a decent setup...i had a cheap pen setup and it always just served as a little nicotine appetizer and made me want a smoke so bad. And the cold turkey doesn't work for me. It is as much a physical habit and a 5 min break from the world as it is a chemical addiction for me.

Anyway, with a nice vape setup, things are feeling good. Heres to day 2. If I can make it through the weekend, I know I'm not out of the woods, but it will feel so great to know that I am moving down the road to recovery.

If anyone has any questions about using a vape, etc (as alot of brick and mortar stores are ripoffs with so many popping up, feel free to message me, i'd be glad to offer any advice)

Sorry for the self-indulgent wall of text. Good luck to everyone, and maybe this post will inspire some lurkers to give it a shot. I know alot of the stories on here of individual struggles, failures and successes has been inspirational and motivational to kick the cigs so my infant son never sees me smoking.

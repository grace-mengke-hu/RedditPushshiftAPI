6 Months! Time flies when your lungs are having fun?

Six months ago, I quit smoking, took up yoga, and continued to eat low carb. Looking back it doesn't seem like it was all that torturous. If I go back thru my posts, I'm sure I suffered. I seem to remember a frantic cleaning frenzy born of nervous energy at some point. But here I am 6 months later, 20 lbs lighter, smoke-free, and more fit than I've been in years.


How did I do it, you ask?

I read Allen Carr, and learned to experience the cravings and study them to find that nothing really hurt physically. The cravings were like tricks of my mind pleading with me to light up.

I used the Smoke Free app. It was very motivating to see the counters progress moment by moment.

I kept carrot strips on hand to 'smoke' when driving or other situations, to mimic the ritual. 

I continued to eat low-carb, and surprisingly was free of the usual food cravings of past attempts.

And it all started when I found this sub! Seriously, I'd been guilting myself about smoking and when I came across this sub. I found so much support and so many helpful tips. In the early days, I posted here many times a day. Thanks /r/Stopsmoking!

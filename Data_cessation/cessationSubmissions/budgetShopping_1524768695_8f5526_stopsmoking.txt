Extremely depressed, want to have a smoke

I got the blues this evening, heavily. But I can't cry, I can't feel anything except deep apathy and desire for rest. I can only think of one thing that would make me slightly less down in the dumps right now, that'd be a cigarette. Just for the distraction this one time. Or I don't see how I can get through these feelings right now.

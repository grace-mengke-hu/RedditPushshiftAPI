How do you feel by the end of your first week without siggaretts?

I'm closing on my 6th day of being a non smoker.  I've started to notice weird withdrawal symptoms. Like I get head rush, or my heartbeat increases without any reason or my hands start to shake.  Ironically this is not a result of a strong craving.  Do other people experience that?

Dear smokers, would you rather...

When craving a smoke, would you rather:
-Smoke 10 cigars at once
-Drink a cup of water with cigarette butts in it 
-Swallow 5 cigars whole
Or not smoke at all
Does the idea gross you out so much you would quit smoking, if not what will? Comment below. I am trying to ask someone to quit smoking. Thanks in advanced.

Father in Law wants to quit after 50 years

Hello all!

I (27, F) am expecting my first child in April, and my father in law (66), who lives with my husband and I, has recently approached me for help with quitting smoking after 50 years. He does not smoke in our house, always outside/in his truck, but he feels strongly that he doesn’t want to continue when the baby comes.

I am deeply touched by this since I had resigned myself to just making sure he always washed his hands and had a designated smoking coat as a way to mitigate our child’s exposure to his smoking.

I have read some of the older posts on here, ones where people have quit after smoking for over 50 years and others similar to mine who are trying to help family members quit smoking after that length of time, and found you all to be so positive, helpful, compassionate and understanding. 

I am aware that I cannot make him do anything, and that it will come down to him to actually quit successfully, but I want to support him as much as I can. I know he will very likely slip up and it will take a while. My question for you wonderful people is this:

Is quitting cold turkey really the best initial method? 

He’s already talked to his doctor about taking a comprehensive approach (patches, RX like chantix, and antidepressants in addition to external support) and all the research I’ve done suggests picking a quit date and just committing to it then, but it seems to me that after such a long addiction, “weaning off” would be a more effective method. Is that not how the nicotine works in the body? I’m here to receive all of your wisdom so please feel free to explain why my thinking is flawed. 

I was going to have him track how many he smokes per day (which he wouldn’t have to share with me) and then reduce that amount on a weekly schedule until it made sense to go cold turkey. Is that a reasonable way to go about it? Open to any/all feedback. Thanks in advance!

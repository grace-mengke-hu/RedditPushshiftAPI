Tomorrow is the day...

After 16 years of smoking 1-1.5 packs a day, and 3 attempts at quitting, tomorrow I’m giving it another shot. In the past I’ve used the patch, gum, and vaping, but this time I’m going cold turkey. I’m sick to my stomach and have a tremendous amount of anxiety thinking about it, but I’m ready. Any positive reinforcement I can get is much appreciated, along with any tips that helped you get past the first big hump...

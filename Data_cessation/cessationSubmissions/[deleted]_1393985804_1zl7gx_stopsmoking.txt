I want a fucking smoke..

and I want that shit NOW. This is half way through day two and god damn this is the worst craving I have had. I'm going cold turkey, and I keep taking deep breaths, but it's not helping.

Any tips? I swear to god I was going to kill people on the subway today. I suppose if I can make it through that, then I can make it through now.

Help!

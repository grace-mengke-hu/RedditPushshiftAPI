Benefits of quitting

Some background about myself, smoked for 16 years and currently 30 years old. Had my 2nd chronic cough in my life and was not going away so i decided to drop smoking altogether, however I am still coughing and it has been for about 2 months but I do know it's not 100% attributed from smoking as I have had fever with some bad sore throat. I was a pretty heavy smoker, almost never failed to finish a pack of 20 a day.

I have attempted to quit in the past which I failed because I was studying for an exam in college and I couldn't get anything in my head while fighting the urge to smoke. 

However this time round I feel strong and empowered to quit and what's enabling that is I keep looking at the benefits of kicking the bad habit, and tell myself if i was to light one up now i will forego any new benefits that may come down the road. This kept me from lighting up another one of those little fuckrs. I am currently a little more than 2 weeks "clean"

So this thread is about sharing what u have experienced as a quitter, the benefits you felt thus far in your journey. 

How did i feel different after quitting for 2 weeks.

* better erections, very noticeable.

* food generally taste better, you can actually tell and isolate the ingredients. 

* better facial complexion ? might be placebo effect. 

* No more yellowish fingers and cleaner teeth.

* No more tight lungs at night after a day of smoking, I had to breath in and hold my breath several times to keep the tightness away.

* Better energy level

* I just feel superior that now I am able to not let cigarette control me, feel proud of myself (I actually feel superior to those who couldn't bring themself to quit. well whatever it takes to not light up right?)

* I get to save more by the end of the month, this is a no brainer and very common motivation for quitting.

* No more breathlessness 

What about you guys ? those who have not light up for a longer period of time. 

I hope this can provide some insights about the benefits of kicking the habit to new quitters.

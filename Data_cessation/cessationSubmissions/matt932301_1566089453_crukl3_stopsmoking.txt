Quitting cold turkey again after failing at 3m12d.

Reset my smoke free app. Trying to keep myself accountable so I’m posting here. I quit for 3 months and 12 days but I continued to chew nicotine gum and vape while drinking. I relapsed after a really stressful week and thought I’ll “just have one”. That one turned into 10 a day over the course of a week and I’m already fatigued all the time, I stink, my car stinks, my clothes stink, I’m coughing, my nose is blocked up and I’m over it. Time to have a crack at quitting cold turkey. I wish I never picked up this stupid habit. 

Does anyone have any good tips for beating the urge in the first few days. I need something to keep my hands busy and help with the anxiety.

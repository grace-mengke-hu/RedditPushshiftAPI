40 days! I feel strong and happy! You can do this, folks!

I'm 29 and have been a smoker for 11 years.  This is my second 'successful' quit.  This WILL be my forever quit.

40 days and nights.  I can get through the normal day without smoking.  The only time I really crave is when I get to places I used to go more frequently (different subway stops, bars, etc) and I see the spot I used to have a smoke before going in.  Its more of a thought than an urge.  I feel sooo much better.  I sleep better.  I wake up better.   I smell and taste better!  But, those first 7ish days were fucking tough.  Its not only the cravings that were tough...it was the self-loathing with the cravings.  The fear that I'm not strong enough to overcome NOT doing something every few hours.  That something had such a strong hold on me and I couldn't wiggle out.  But, a few thoughts helped me keep strong and not pick up another cigarette.  I thought I would share with you.

 * Play the 'you know who was able to quit?' game.  Usually I think of dipshits I knew in high school that have successfully quit.  But, celebrities work too.  Mel Gibson has quit smoking.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Obama (while running for president), Whoopie, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck....it works better for me if I hate the person, but it can also work positively with the idea that 'Matt Damon is the shit-I should follow his lead and quit this nonsense!'

 * My health.  I have had HPV for an insane amount of time.  The infection is getting smaller and smaller....but I just can't totally kick it.  They're talking about fucking lasering that shit out of me.  If quitting cigs gives my immune system the boost it needs to finally get rid of this cancer causing virus....seems like a win-win.  Sure, the diagnosis didn't get me to quit....but it should have.  Its embarrassing to think I was diagnosed with something that is made worse by cigs and did NOTHING.  For years.  I'm an adult.  No more.  There's also the fact that my OBGYN told me 10 days before my quit date that I need to quit in the next year, or they won't write me my birth control prescription anymore....that really sent it home for me.  I mean...I dont drink soda, I always wear protection, I don't do heavy drugs....hell, I make a point of limiting my sugar/carb/salt intake each day!  I cook super healthy meals!  YET-I do this.  It cancels out all the good I do for my body pretty easily.  

 * Family.  I live w my boyfriend that quit 2 years ago.  We quit together....and I picked it back up.  My smoking was absolutely getting in between us.  I stunk.  We have had more sex, more cuddles, more kisses in the past 40 days....the shame I felt when he would hesitate with a kiss after arriving home from work should have been enough.  After the first few days of him giving me high-quality welcome-home kisses from work was a huge thing.  I would close my eyes and think of his happy face after kissing non-smoking me whenever I got a craving.  There's also my dog...that would literally back away from me whenever I lit up a cigarette.  Or my mom, who cried the day she found a pack in my bag.  She somehow transferred this memory into being my sister (a smoker years and years ago) so i never dealt w/ the guilt consequences...but I spent a lot of time hiding my smoking from my family.  Sneaking out the house, finding reasons to leave family gatherings, etc.  The day I quit was the day of my cousin's wedding and I knew it was small enough that I wouldn't get away with smoking.  So, I left the pack at home.  By the time we got home from the wedding, it had been 36 hours and I figured why not just keep on going?  Best decision of my life.

 * $$$$  I'm in serious debt.  Its incredible how much i was spending on this addiction for the past 10 years.  I spent more on cigarettes than I have in debt right now (some student, mostly credit card...its awful).  I live really goddamn frugally on so many levels...and yet I spend serious amounts of mon-ay on this nonsense.  Its so fucking stupid.

 * THE SMELL.  I still have this medal bucket outside in our back yard that I put my butts in.  Its still there.  The first few days til about a week after my quit, I would get really bad cravings after dinner (my favorite and last cigarette of the day).  So, instead of festering, I would go outside and bend down and take a big-ol-whiff.  Now, I know the smell of actively smoking smells good those first few days....but a year worth of marinating cig butts does not.  I almost vomited once taking a whiff of that poison.  Note to self-finally trash that shit tonight....

 * The 'fuck you, I'm gonna go have a cigarette because I'm pissed off about something' smoking was hard to give up.  But I realized that if I'm pissed at my boyfriend for doing something.....paying to make myself smell bad and harm my health wasn't really 'getting back at him'.  It was immature and stupid.  Its something a child would do. I am an adult.  I can use my words, not just do something to piss him off too.  Two wrongs don't make a right.

 * RUNNING.  I have been a runner for a few years now.  My pace has always been about 9 minutes.  Has not ever improved.  Now that I'm not smoking, I feel like I just took off a bullet-proof vest (those things are heavy, right?) and can now run without all that extra weight holding me down!  Its insane how much easier it is to do...everything.  Run to catch a bus.  Walk to the bus to work (its quit the uphill workout...), do my pushups, do my squat jumps.  But for real...I thought everyone struggled for air when they ran.  Holy crap-its like a whole new sport.  Now that my lungs aren't holding my down, I'm having to do more strength training because my ankle strength is now holding me down!

 * This sub.  Man.  I'm on here daily.  It feels like just reading what you folks have to say is really a great reinforcement.  You all are incredible humans and I am glad that you all post/comment on this site.  You all bring something to the table.

I wish you all the luck in the world, everyone.  You CAN do this.  You ARE strong enough.  It's a handful of days of hell....I won't sugar coat it.  But, then its the rest of your life of...smelling and tasting and health and happiness and pride.  Its worth the cost.  Its worth being alive and being healthy enough to enjoy this crazy world we live in with the people we love.

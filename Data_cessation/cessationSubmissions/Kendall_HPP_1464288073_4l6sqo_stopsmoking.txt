Obsessing over them

Hope this ok to post here.

Curious how you guys stayed "busy" mentally, especially on day 1. 

The few times I've tried, I go to bed and plan on not having any in the morning but then when I wake up its literally ALL I think about until I break down and tell myself some poor excuse.

Day 2: Still difficult.

Day 2 guys, and it's getting harder to want to do this. Today has seen more cravings. The difference between now and times before, is I'm more determined to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest problem I've had so far is the thought "Just one and then you'll drop it"

This never works. Stay strong.

Thanks for the support on the last post.

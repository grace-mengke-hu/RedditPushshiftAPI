From 444 to 1

Posted this about a month ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/8vcg2f/i\_started\_again\_looked\_at\_my\_badge\_and\_it\_said/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/8vcg2f/i_started_again_looked_at_my_badge_and_it_said/)

But today I've decided is the official day one...again.  Over the years and years I've done this back and forth and 444days straight was the longest I had held out.  Now.  To be honest, I haven't picked it up nearly as much as I once had.  One or two at night during the week and then more on the weekend; but I can already feel the anxiety in my chest and the fogginess in my head.  I have a nicorette inhaler but look to only use it in extreme cases otherwise I want to cold turkey.  

The worst part is the fall back to this again.  To have to go through this withdraw again.  To know damn well that I didn't even need to "have one fun" because I knew I'd slip back.  I have to stop romanticizing this crap habit and addiction.  I cannot for the life of me understand why smoking a cigarette makes cool evenings more enjoyable, they are already pretty damn pleasant, and I honestly hate the taste of the cigarette come morning.  

So here's to day 1 again and the coming posts I'll have to do here to just keep myself engaged with the community to force myself to commit.

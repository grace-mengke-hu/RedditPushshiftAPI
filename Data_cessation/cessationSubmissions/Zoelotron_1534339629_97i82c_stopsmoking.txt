Made it through a day in the office without smoking for the first time in months.

I've been playin' a lot of magic the gathering, and there's a big tournament downtown this weekend.  It occurred to me that I'm not going to have a lot of time between rounds to smoke so I bought a thing of patches. (I think this is the first time they've ever been cheaper for me than just buying cigarettes.) 

One step that's always proven hard for me is making it through a day in the office without smoking.  Tuesday is my office day.  It was weird because yesterday was both easy and hard. Worth it, though. Best part was waking up today actually feeling rested. Imagine, waking up and not wanting to immediately go back to bed. Insanity.  What is this timeline even?

Then playing magic yesterday without having smoked.  Woah.  No fatigue from working all day, no impatience to finish a game.  It was like I was completely in control of everything that was going on in this game of massive variance.  Like, what, huh?

also i'm pretty sure this sub is the most positive place on the internet. is there a subreddit discord?  There should be; you guys are awesome.

not ready to set a badge quite yet.  I wont feel like this is "for real" until I make it through the GP this weekend.

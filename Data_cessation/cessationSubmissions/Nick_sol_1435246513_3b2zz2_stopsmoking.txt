Sitting in a pub with a beer....

That is a difficult one. The beer is good, but feeling like I'm missing something. I do hope that this gets easier , or else i won't be able to enjoy a pub like I used to. But staying strong and not going  out for a smoke. Maybe order two beers , keep both hands occupied that way ðŸ˜‰

Stopped with EasyWay

I've smoked casually (< 10/day) for just over twenty years. I've had some long periods of stopping, but eventually came back. I've tried NRT and Chantix.

I read the book this weekend, on Sunday afternoon I smoked my last cigarette. So far it's been good.

Has anyone else read the book or attended the seminars? If so, what has been your experience?

After learning some of the terms (I'm a Yank, but bought the U.K. ebook), I felt a lot better about stopping. That last cigarette really wasn't that enjoyable. I'm a bit anxious though, as I've stopped before, for months at a time.

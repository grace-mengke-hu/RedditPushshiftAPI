So it begins...

Finaly I have decided to try and quit smoking. Been smoking a pack a day for about 5 years now and after my grandfather passed away last week I have made up my mind. He didnt die from a smoking related illness, its just I know he wouldnt have wanted me to keep smoking. He always asked me to stop, and as a former smoker himself he knew what he was talking about. Im just about to enter my office and im smoking my last cig. So, heres hoping ill make it last. Cheers.

Day 14

Went cold turkey New Year's Day and I'm glad of it but I have some concerns.  For instance, is this much gas normal??  I mean.  I know I'm snacking more to compensate for not smoking but it's not like I'm snacking on beans, ffs.  

Also, 2 weeks in and my poop seems to be getting harder by the day.  I'm not actually constipated yet and I do plan to eat more fruits/ veggies/ fiber but geez.  I hope it doesn't keep getting worse.  I don't want hemorrhoids too :(

Main concern:  I swear it feels like I'm thinking about cigarettes ALL the time.  I work from home but am on the road most afternoons.  Getting out of the house seems to help but time still seems distorted/ there's too much of it.  The addict in me wants a cigarette very badly and I feel like its voice is getting louder/ clamoring.  I do NOT want to smoke/ repeat this process ever again.  Any ideas/ suggestions much appreciated.

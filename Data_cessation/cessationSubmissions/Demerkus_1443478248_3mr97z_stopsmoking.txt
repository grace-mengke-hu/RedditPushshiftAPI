After the 1 billionth try, two weeks in!

I had my last cigarette what feels like many moons ago now!
It's been such a tough road, and it still will be, but I've had so much support from friends and family, and it really does help.
For anyone out there who's struggling, just remember, why you're quitting, and that everyone who cares will help you as much as they can.
It's taken me so many tries, but I genuinely believe that I'm done for good.
Thanks to all those who post, this truly is a great subreddit, even for lurkers like me!

Advice on quitting after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way

I've been smoking for about 10 years. Lately I've been trying to stop because my wife refuses to have kids unless I do. I'd read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking a few years ago and, though I found it interesting and very informative, it did not seem to help me quit. If anything, it made me feel more hopeless because after failing to quit I couldn't read it "for the first time" again. I think part of the problem is that I wasn't convinced that quitting could actually be easy for me.


My question is, since I really do agree with a lot of the book, is there anyone out there who quit more or less the way he says, but wasn't convinced it would work? Can anyone explain their thought process as they quit using this method?


I've read/listened to it several times now, and I still don't see what I'm missing. At the part where he says you should have an eager feeling like a dog straining at the leash, I realize I am feeling the exact opposite.


If Easy Way worked for you, can you share some details?

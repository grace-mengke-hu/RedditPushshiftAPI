I want to be there.

When I met my husband in 2004 we both smoked pretty heavily. We smoked in our house, our cars, places we weren't supposed to. We were pro-smoker smokers. Young and invincible and couldn't imagine it any other way. 4 years later I got pregnant and we both quit. Then I had a baby and we both started again. 

We grew tired of the expense and we set a quit date for October 1st, 2012. At the end of September that year I experienced severe neurological issues and due to the stress of that we put it off to New Years 2013. I assumed he was bluffing. I know I was. I somewhat quit for a few months before I started again but he QUIT. It's been more than 3 years and I honestly don't even think of him as a smoker. It's weird to imagine him smoking. He's had a puff a couple times but it makes him sick and he says it's disgusting. I'm sure he could be a smoker again if he REALLY worked at it but I think he's officially made it to the other side. He lives his life happily and fully while NOT SMOKING. These last couple of days have been extremely difficult but I want what he has. I want to be there. Gotta keep my eyes on the prize.

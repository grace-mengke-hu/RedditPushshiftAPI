Wow 3 years already

3 years ago I quit on new years, that didn't take and I was smoking again within 2-3 days.  I ordered Allan Carr's book, got it on the 6th, finished reading it on the 8th, and that was my last cig.  I quit probably 20 times before that, it only has to stick once!  Good luck everyone who is just starting this year!

Pack-a-day smoker. Day 5 without any cigarettes.

I really think I can do it this time. Cravings are at an all time low & my breathing is much better already. I live an otherwise healthy life. Cigarettes were literally one of the only unhealthy things I was doing and they were getting in the way of progress at the gym.

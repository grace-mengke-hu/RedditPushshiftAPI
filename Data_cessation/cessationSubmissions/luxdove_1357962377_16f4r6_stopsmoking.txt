Had to remove my badge after 10 days clean.  

I just didn't see this coming.  I was going so strong and then my panic disorder reared its head like I've not seen in years.  Constant panic attacks lasting for hours, almost delusional thinking.  I was exercising and everything.  I just don't know if I can do it.  My mother smokes, always has several packs in the house at all times.  Sometimes I feel like it's the only thing that keeps my mind from completely overwhelming me with hypochondriac delusions.  I don't know if I can quit in my current terrible living conditions, in this state of mind I cannot seem to change.  I feel so defeated and guilty.  Anyone else successful with major mental illnesses?  It would really help me to hear from you.

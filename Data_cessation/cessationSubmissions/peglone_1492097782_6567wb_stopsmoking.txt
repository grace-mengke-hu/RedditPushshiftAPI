I stopped today.

Hello guys!
Had my last cigarette few hours ago. I have finished reading the Allen Carr's Easyway. 
The book is really amazing, it made me really hate the cigarettes and the fact that I've been smoking for almost 4 years (I'm turning 19 very soon). 
I want to live a healthier and more confident life.
Anyways, I wanted to say thanks to this community, it helped me a lot and I will for sure continue to be part of it.
Love you guys!

In need of some help!

Hi guys! I had got such a long way (I will reset my counter tonight) and then something happened (a friend committed suicide in a pretty horrific way) and of course I gave in to that STUPID voice telling me it would be okey to just have one. Now I know that this leads to smoking again, but I believed the voice for the second time and now I’ve been smoking for two weeks, too scared to give up again and feeling like I can’t do it and I’m never going to beat that voice. GAH! I really want to give up tonight but that voice is in my head saying “you can’t do it” etc etc... I hate smoking, I hate how tired I am, I hate how I smell, and I have a triathlon (an Ironman no less - albeit over three days) in three weeks and I SO want to give up. But I’m single and haven’t told any of my friends I started again as I’m too embarrassed. Could I ask you guys for help? I just feel so useless and alone in this stupid struggle against nicotine! Sorry :(

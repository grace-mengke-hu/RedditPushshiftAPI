How do you guys deal with the mood swings?

I've been a pack a day smoker for about 6 years. I've tried to quit on several different occasions but I just get so god damn mean. Anytime I've ever tried to quit I develop this hair trigger temper and literally anything can set me off.   
  
Does it get better?  
  
How long am I going to have to deal with it?

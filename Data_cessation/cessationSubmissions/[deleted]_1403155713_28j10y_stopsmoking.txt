You know what's weird about quitting?

Realzing that you're not "a smoker" anymore.

I had a doctors appointment earlier and when filling out the patient history form I got to the "Are you currently a smoker?" part of it and instinctively checked the "yes" box. 

I quickly scratched that out, marked the "no" box and then checked with the receptionist to make sure it cool and that I didn't need to fill out a new form. 

I don't know why but it was such a weird moment for me, almost surreal. It was extremely freeing knowing that that part of my life is behind me. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm still getting used to not being "a smoker" but it feels great and I couldn't be happier about it. 

It's been about 4 months and going strong. Just wanted to share and say thanks to /r/stopsmoking. All of your posts and stories I've read have definitely helped me along the way.

3 months today!!!

Here's all the pretty-immediate &amp; observable benefits for me.

If you haven't quit yet or if you're struggling, you can do it! You got this! I hope at least some of these bullet points get you motivated to keep protecting your quit no matter how far in you are, because being a non-smoker is fuckin' awesome.

Head's up: I'm a woman &amp; I'm pretty extroverted, so some of these observed benefits won't fit for everybody):

* No more nasty tobacco flakes at the bottom of my bag or pocket(s) or stuck to my makeup (I have a cream blush that was always like a magnet to tobacco flakes - it was super gross, guys)

* Coffee tastes so much better without cigarettes. In fact, everything tastes so much better.

* My extremities aren't perpetually cold anymore! Thanks "improved circulation"!

* Speaking of 'improved circulation,' my gums bleed when I floss! You'd think this is a bad thing, but actually the lack of blood circulation in/around the gums as a result of smoking puts people into a false sense of security when they floss and they *don't* bleed. I'm bleeding - my gum's blood circulation is *back* - and I am flossing like a motherfucker now so they *won't* bleed anymore and it'll be because they're *healthy* and *not* because they're not getting enough blood in the first place.

* Working out: my day-to-day improvement with both cardio &amp; strength is miles better now at 31 years of age with 3 months as a non-smoker than when I was a smoker at 27. 

* I never realized how much I loved the sense of smell until it came back to me. I adore essential oils, bath bombs (shampoo &amp; conditioner scents matter to me a lot now too), candles, aromatherapy, fragrances, etc. I designate them for different things too, like lotus flower for yoga, either "fluffy blankets" or "fresh linens" or "cotton" candle scents for daytime activities, I light "midnight woods" candle in the evenings right now, lavender+chamomile for going to sleep (this is if I'm busy in the house most of the day, lol). Also, I pick up various scents for specific holidays - so far (bc it's only been 3 months): apple-cinnamon, fireside (anything that smells like a campfire is one of my all-time favorite scents) &amp; wet-autumn-leaves scents in the fall, peppermint, clove, etc. for winter... both seasons are heavy on cinnamon &amp; ginger imo though...

 The point is, I *seriously* love to smell things now.

* I can actually have *fun* controlling what my body smells like using perfumes &amp; whatnot. I've never had *fun* with that before - it was always just any/every effort to cover up the scent of cigarettes. I don't have to stress anymore about that though! Woohoo!

* Saving money! Fuck *yesssssss*. But also, saving money wouldn't as great a benefit for me if I didn't set that money aside to reward myself at meaningful checkpoints of accomplishment. Recently, there was a post submitted by a user that gave a few of his own major benefits for having quit, and one of them was that his 'user jr.' was gettin' a bit friskier/happier in general. So, I'm here to share the general happiness in that arena goes for *both* genders &amp; a visit to Amazon's [Sexual Health &amp; Wellness store](https://smile.amazon.com/Sexual-Wellness-Products/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3777371) ain't a bad option if you want to reward yourself for having protected your quit so long - long enough to have your libido waking up from its slumber ;)

* In addition to my body, I like that my *clothes* aren't soaking up the scent of cigarettes anymore either. No matter how far outside I was, my clothes would still distinctly smell of cigarettes. I used to go to parties &amp; [in the coat room, look around](https://imgur.com/cZTOXYU) for a place where nobody had put their jacket so my jacket's smelly cigarette scent wouldn't transfer onto theirs. No more! I can just chuck it wherever - onto whoever's jackets - now bc my shit doesn't stink anymore! :D

Some of these "pros" are rather interlaced, but I'll try to separate them:

* I love being able to stay in non-smoking locations (so basically: anywhere/everywhere) and genuinely *enjoy* my experience in that place *for a long period of time*. In the beginning of my quit, I used to exist in non-smoking areas and after about an hour, my mind would be like "break time! okay, plan: you gotta beg away from whatever conversation you're in, go get your coat, scope out if there's other smokers who'd like to go out with you, wait for *them* to get their coats, and head outdoors in freezing weather to have a cigarette!" but then I'd catch myself up &amp; realize "oh wait. I don't do that shit anymore. I can just *stay here* now and continue to enjoy this atmosphere &amp; its warmth, the drink in my hand, the people I'm with &amp; the conversations I'm having with them." It's actually pretty liberating - it feels *really good.* Feels wholesome... like you've really got your shit together.

* In addition to that whole scenario, there's an added observable benefit here: I'm more *social* in general, now. I hadn't realized how anti-social 'social' smoking was until I quit. I would break *great* conversations with brilliant non-smoking friends to go out &amp; get my nicotine fix (with or without having tagged other smokers to come with me), and if I didn't have people with me, it'd be a boring few minutes of solitude *or* if I *had* people with me, we'd all be sort of chatting about the event while it's happening as though we were removed from it - as though it was already over. That mental place of separating yourself from the events/activities you're attending - I think it's innately anti-social. Now that I've spent 3 months attending social events/activities without taking "breaks" from it, I'm realizing that my perception of how happy (and *not* stressful - I always used to think social events/activities were stressful so cig breaks were so nice but now I'm calling bullshit on smoker-me) they are has increased tremendously from how it used to be.

Okay, back to the smaller (edit: NOT, lol - this turned out to be *not* smaller) observable things:

* Every time I worked out as a smoker, it *always* felt like I was doing it to *compensate* for smoking. Like in my head, it didn't matter if I hit all my most intense goals - if I was still a smoker, it'd be like [LarryDavid.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/NlR0RF1v972Mw/source.gif). Like *okay*, but if you didn't smoke, *then* you'd *actually* start getting healthy, stophauntingme. Don't try to kid a kidder (lol). Now that I'm a non-smoker, all my workouts feel like they're along the lines of "I'm a healthy person getting healthier" vs. "I'm a smoker trying to run or lift off the odds of the gamble on my life that I've got goin' on here." 

* Same situation as above, but this time with teeth whitener. There's nothing like pulling those strips off your teeth after an hour, seeing some noticeable difference in how many shades whiter they are, and knowing that - because you don't smoke anymore - your teeth are gonna stay this white for longer *and* that any/all tobacco stains will completely disappear eventually. When I was a smoker, I was always rather glum over how these teeth whiteners probably couldn't fix any tobacco staining for very long when there was *still* such a frequent influx of tobacco smoke circling around my mouth on a daily basis. 

* No soap would fix it: my fingers used to smell ungodly, and the thickest scent of cigs I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing would be my fingers after smoking one. I also had a thick callus of yellow, tobacco-stained skin on my thumb for how often I'd roll a lighter's flint wheel. Super rare *anybody* could notice, but I knew. I knew how gnarly it was. My fingers stopped smelling around the end of week one, and the callus - in all its nasty thick-yellow-skinned glory - disappeared after about 3 weeks of quitting. 

* Enjoying the outdoors - I *actually* enjoy it. On the occasions where I want to go outside and just enjoy my outside surroundings, I go out for a walk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but after a few walks as a non-smoker, I don't know *how* you can enjoy the weather or nature in general when you've got the scent of cigarettes floating around you (nevermind that you're trying to have a moment with outdoor nature/weather, yet you're sucking in poisonous smoke instead of fresh air and letting the unnatural scent of cigs soak into your clothes). Taking a walk with an improved sense of smell *and* a lack of cig-smoke-smells following you around-? It's a *much* better walk &amp; experience if you want to appreciate your outdoor surroundings (*and* bonus: you won't be huffing &amp; puffing nearly as much if your walk is at all challenging).

* My pets aren't inhaling second-hand smoke anymore... and that always makes me feel better.

* At home, I can drink wine or beer *anywhere in the house* now! It's amazing! I used to only drink in the kitchen (at the kitchen table) because the kitchen was the designated smoking room, but now that I've managed to break the craving-association between alcohol &amp; cigs, I'm really enjoying drinking wherever the hell I want. Again: liberating.

* Way more relaxed just in general, lifestyle-wise. When I quit cigs, I did a lot of research because I was rather obsessed with the concept (how can you *not* be when you're craving so often, you know? If it's on my mind, I might as well look some shit up about it), and I discovered that despite allllll the rhetoric over how cigarettes help with stress, cigarettes actually *physically induce* symptoms of stress like increased heart rate &amp; blood pressure... and long-term, they *keep* stressing you out bc your *general* heart rate goes up (bc it's gotta move your gloppy, not-as-oxygenated-as-it-should-be blood around your shitty body) &amp; blood pressure increases (bc your artery walls have narrowed &amp; hardened, making it necessary to increase the pressure necessary to push your shitty blood through 'em, lol) whether you're having a cig or not.

* Supplement to the above benefit: deep breathing, yoga, and meditation is *fuckin' amazing*! These practices *actually decrease stress*, as opposed to cigarettes. If you unconsciously began to breathe shallowly as a smoker like I did, these practices also help you heal from your smoking years in that they all (like, all 3 practices) force you to breathe deeply (to get allllll the oxygen into the deepest parts of your lungs to oxygenate *every* cell of de-oxygenated blood) &amp; thus gets you to start breathing deeply normally during the day as well (so it breaks the shallow-breathing habit that long-term smoking caused). You guys should all be aware that the reason behind why smoking fucks up *every* organ in some way is because smoking causes shitty, not-oxygenated-enough-blood and shitty, crusty-hard &amp; narrow arteries... so all the organs that need healthy oxygenated blood to work (which is all of them) don't *get* healthy oxygenated blood, and the shitty smoker's blood they *do* get takes way too much effort to arrive (bc of shitty smoker's arteries), lol. All of this shit starts to heal &amp; get better over time as a non-smoker, and it's amazing. Just visualize how your arteries are getting more flexible &amp; opening up for easier/faster circulation &amp; how healthy-oxygenated-bright-red your artery blood is becoming (or would be if it wasn't in the perpetual darkness of your body) because your lungs are getting better &amp; better at their job (because you're not fucking them up anymore)!!!

* My breath actually smells pretty great these days. It's awesome.

* Skincare has gotten a *lot* more rewarding. The increased circulation has me less pale &amp; while I hate to admit it, my tone was a bit sallow, so also way less sallow than I was as a smoker. Now my skin tone is a much healthier peach and it's *reactive*:  when I'm out in cold weather, I get those bright rosy cheeks. When I go through my skincare routine, I can see much more easily how my skin's reacting to it (and adapt accordingly so I'm not accidentally stripping my face of important jazz that it actually likes &amp; needs to be healthy &amp; feel good). And I'm fucking thrilled that, as a result of quitting, I've probably prevented the age-lines smokers get from puckering their lips so often (called [feathering](http://blog.candylipz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/medicinenet-750x400.png)). That one thing in particular I've seen *a lot* before, so I single it out, but also I'm really happy to quit so as to prevent loads of other premature signs of aging that smoking just *loooooves* to cause. Last year, I got into skincare, and I love that I did because I was still a smoker... and now that I'm not, I'm kind of like "*wow*, okay, this is making a difference," lol. 

Okay. I hope this long-ass essay of benefits was fun/helpful/other-positive-things to read.

If you're *thinking* of quitting: there's no contest. You totally should. For all these listed reasons and more. 

And if you think I still don't get cravings &amp; it's totally the easiest thing, you're wrong: while writing this, I admit I had a couple fleeting cravings. But they're *so fleeting.* It gets better - it always &amp; continually keeps getting better and easier.

But... speaking of more reasons to quit, if you're riding pretty high, please please feel free to share your own benefits if I missed some (or if there's some additional male-specific or introvert-specific benefits that haven't hit me bc I'm not those things). I love reading them : they get me so happy &amp; motivated to keep my quit. 

Thanks for reading, guys!

**TL:DNR** I'm 3 months smoke free &amp; quitting is awesome for, like, a lot of reasons.

Edit: one last thing - thank you so *so* much to this subreddit. People credit Allen Carr or the smoke free app a lot, but I've relied *way* more on this subreddit than that app or book (which I've only gotten like 50 pages in) to keep me on the straight &amp; narrow. In particular - and this is gonna sound weird - you guys have *really* effectively gotten me scared of relapsing. Usually, fear isn't a great motivator for me, but I guess I just think of it as one of the most visceral negative feelings I can have about something... so it's turned out to serve as a really effective deterrent for me. So to all those who have relapsed and have posted about it bc you felt shitty as a result: I'm so sorry, but thank you. Thank you so much. Your posts keep reinforcing to me (and others) how there are *awful* consequences to having just *one* cigarette &amp; breaking your quit... and that's a *really* important thing to remember if/when a craving gets *so bad* that you start to rationalize it with 'just one cig.'

Smoke Free Cravings

Hi. I’m on my 3rd (or 4th?) day of not smoking and I’m trying my best but the Smoke Free app does not have an option for cravings “walking home from metro stop” option, and it takes a fucking exactly 8 minutes to walk to/from the metro (so a perfect timing for 1 cigarette) !!!!!! This is my biggest trigger when I ALWAYS smoked my cigarette. and there are no options whatsoever for this kind of cigarette on the app AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY!!!!!!! I actually will cry when I get home because I’m so so so angry. Bit I’m channeling my anger on this post. Will.not.smoke.today.

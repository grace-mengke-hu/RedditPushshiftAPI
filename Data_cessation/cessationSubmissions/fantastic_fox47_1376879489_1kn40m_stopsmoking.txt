Today is the first of many...

So I'm taking another stab at quitting. I'm tired of smelling like shit. I'm tired of running out of breath when I walk up stairs. I'm tired of counting the hours till I can have another smoke. I'm tired of coughing all the damn time. I'm tired of being a slave to cigarettes. Today is my first day as a non-smoker. I know I can do this!

Please help, my father is killing himself

Guys please i really need some advice. I dont know if this is the right place to post this but screw it.

Heres a little back story;

My father had a massive heart attack about a month ago and almost died. He had to get 2 stents put in. Docs said smoking was a big factor in the cause of it, and that he needs to stop smoking immediately or he will die soon.

As soon as the docs let him out of the hospital he started smoking, and has been smoking as if nothing happened. He is fully aware that if he keeps smoking he is going to die, but he just doesnt seem to care at all. On top of smoking like a chimney, he drinks beer like water. 

My mother and i have been trying everything to get him to quit but he just won't. He tried vaping to quit but hated it. We practically beg him daily. I sat down and had a talk with him and what he told me has put me in a depression. 

He said "Boy, I'm burned out, and worth more dead then alive, life sucks then you die"

 Hes reffering to him not being able to work anymore and the life insurance and what not. Hes only in his 60s. Seeing my big strong dad letting these cancer sticks slowly kill him  is fucking killing me inside. i dont want him to go out like this. 

I really want to help but i dont know how, i know he wants to quit but hes been a heavy smoker for 50 years and is a very stubborn man. Please can someone give me advice to help him kick this habbit.


I just want my dad to be around longer

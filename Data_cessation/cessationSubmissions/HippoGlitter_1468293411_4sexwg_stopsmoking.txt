Almost 100 days cigarette free

I posted here a few months back shortly after I found out I was pregnant and my husband and I quit smoking. I felt like I should update to say that we've both stuck to it, and I can say that at this point that it does really get better.

I rarely have cravings and don't regret quitting at all. I want to celebrate the 100 day mark, but I'm not sure what to do since most fun activities are off the table this late in my pregnancy! 

I just wanted to let you all know that thanks to this community and our own willpower we're going strong and it does really get better! If you ever need support or someone to vent to, I'm all ears.

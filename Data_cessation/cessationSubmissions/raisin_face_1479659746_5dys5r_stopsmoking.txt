Tomorrow is the day! Any advice?

So tomorrow I will quit smoking once and for all! I've been smoking 8 years (ages 12-20), have 4 failed attempts at stopping, and am currently on between 15 and 20 a day. I decided to quit after making the decision to go to work in Canada for 2 years following on from visiting a friend and falling in love with the place and the people I met. All of my new friends are non smokers, and I felt ashamed of myself, stupid for poisoning myself and unhealthy for smoking. Plus the cost of tobacco over there is through the roof! 

So I've decided that I want to quit - and I mean REALLY want, not just know that I should - so that I can be a healthy, active person without coughing a lung out every time I go for a stroll, and also so that I can save some money before going. I'm going cold turkey, I've tried nicotine supplements before but I think they made it harder for me. 

Does anyone have any advice for the quitting process? I'm scared of how hard it's going to be, and if there are any do's/don'ts that I don't know about. Thanks in advance!

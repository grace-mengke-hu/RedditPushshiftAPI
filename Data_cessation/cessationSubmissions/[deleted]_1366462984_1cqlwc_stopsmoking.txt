Why is it impossible to not smoke in college?

I've been a smoker for going on 3 years now. When I started college I on average smoked about a pack a day, now about a year later I have stopped buying packs and will even go a few days without smoking. However, from time to time for almost no reason I'll buy a pack, smoke about 3 and be unbelievably pissed off at myself. 

I'd like to think of myself as an ex-smoker but when I relapse I feel as if i'll never be able to quit. Suggestions on how to avoid this?

(Usually I think of my justification for relapse as stress but at this point I don't even know anymore)

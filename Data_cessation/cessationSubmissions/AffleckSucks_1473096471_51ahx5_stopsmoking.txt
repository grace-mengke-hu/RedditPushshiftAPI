Smoking alternatives

I've never been much of a cigarette smoker, but it's something my father struggled with my whole childhood. He instilled in me a deep fear of the addiction of nicotine and tobacco in general. I did, however, pick up smoking weed when I was 17 and used to do it about once every two weeks.It wasn't until I was 20 and one of my best friends passed away that I really began my addiction, smoking every day for over two years. I realized just how relaxing smoking is, sitting there, quietly, deep in my own thought. It has snowballed on me the past three years and now I am looking for any smoking alternative that can help ween me off of my bad habit. Unfortunately, I have turned to cigarettes (very rarely) to try and keep my addiction at bay. I am wondering if there is any (pseudo)healthy smoking alternatives besides the usual e-cig/ vapes for the simple reason that I don't want to be lumped into the category of young 20-somethings that are apart of the "#vapelife". I've also done a little bit of online research that says that the often "herbal" alternatives are nothing short of different paths to contract cancer. If anyone has some advice for me, I would be willing to try anything. I am trying to go to law school next year and must kick my habit before I go or I fear my entire life plan to this point may be doomed.

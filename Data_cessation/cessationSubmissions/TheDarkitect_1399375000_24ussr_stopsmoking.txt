3 days and going strong ! I woke up this morning without feeling the urge to smoke !

Despite the fact it kinda fucked up my sleep patterns, since I used to smoke right before I went to bed, this morning I woke up without *needing* my cigarette. 

I bought a pack of chewing-gums yesterday, but hey, I didn't even need one !

I think this is the beginning of a new life, of MY new life. I'm so happy.

How to deal with friends who smoke?

Hi everyone :)

I'm on day 2 of attempted .. who knows anymore after 10 or so years. My best friend who I see at least once a week is close to a pack a day smoker, we've tried to quit together, but that never happens, so I decided to try on my own.

We usually hang out in her garage so we can smoke, how do I handle the cravings while around her, also without asking her to not do that in her own place?

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

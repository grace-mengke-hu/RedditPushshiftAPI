I actually did it.

I made a post yesterday about how I have kept talking about quitting over the last four or five years, and today was the first time in that whole span that I actually went a full day without smoking.

I know it isn't much, but for me it at least signals the beginning of some actual form of willpower over smoking. Hopefully I can keep it up.
Thanks for your encouragement yesterday =)

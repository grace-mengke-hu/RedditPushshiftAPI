been reducing my use

hey whats up everyone, i have a couple questions. 

so ive been smoking for about 13 years, since i was 14. recently, ive particularly felt like complete crap from smoking and want to stop. ive significantly reduced my usage, from about a pack a day to about 4-7 a day. my questions are as follows:

1. did you reduce your use before quitting?

2. how long before you decided to quit did you ultimately take the dive and stop?

3. did you go cold turkey? use gum/patches/vapor?

4. how many attemps before you finally quit?

5. gain/lose weight?

6. and this is the most important. i do like to drink alcohol, on a fairly regular basis. 

       6a. how did drinking effect your ability to quit?

       6b. can you still drink in the same situations and not smoke?
       how hard is it to drink casually and not smoke?


thank you for all your answers.

Edit: thanks for all the responses gives me some insight into what im up against!

I can't imagine ... beyond tobacco

I like to drink beer, sometimes I drink 12 beers in a day.

I don't smoke often, or, I don't smoke tobacco often. I use smokeless tobacco, generally.

I want to quit, but I'm afraid that I might drink more than 12 beers in a day, or some other disastrous effect.

It's like Dave says, I guess. I don't do anything in a hurry. I really try to live by that, because Dave is literally paralyzed, and walks and talks.

I don't like cigarettes. They smell awful. Heavy metals or something.

So, thinking of switching to snus, has anyone done this? A problem that I have that I didn't encounter in county jail is that there are cheaper alternatives. $0.99 cigars, for example. 

Considering how dread cigar use is to me, should I substitute cigars for smokeless maybe?

Anything helps. Thanks.

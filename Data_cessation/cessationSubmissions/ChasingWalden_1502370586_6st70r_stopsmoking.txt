Day 23: how to treat the congestion?

Hi! I am on day 23 and doing really well. My daily routine is adjusting to fill in the gaps left from smoke breaks, and smoking is no longer a part of who I am. Loving the money, the peace, the nonsmoker life. 

But I am so incredibly congested. Just now starting a productive cough too. Haven't had any tarry mucous monsters come up yet, just a little phlegm. 

I am a runner and too puny-feeling to exercise long, but I'm trying. 

I took Sudafed and it helps, but is this the best solution? I know I don't have a real illness, so I don't know if I should treat as allergy, a cold, or a flu. 

Doesn't seem critical enough for a doc visit yet, would like to know what worked for you guys. I was a 21 year smoker at two packs a day when I stopped. On a 7mg patch from the get-go. 

Thanks :)

Oh, and smoke free app says I'm supposed to say "I don't smoke" a bunch today. 

So...I don't smoke. First time adult-me has ever been able to say that.

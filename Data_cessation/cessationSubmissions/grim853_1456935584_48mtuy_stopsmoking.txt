Do illnesses and common colds feel different after smoking?

My situation is; I quit smoking over a year ago, and haven't seemed to have a cold since. I HAVE however had what I assumed to be allergic flare ups with stuffy/runny nose, throat irritation, and a mild cough. I was wondering if maybe I could have something transmissible, but don't recognize it because it doesn't feel like my lungs are trying to painfully crawl out through my throat and I am about to die, as was the case with colds when I was smoking. It's important because I take allergy shots which require that I not go to if I have a cold. I will of course ask my doctor about it, but I wanted to know if anyone here has had a similar experience.

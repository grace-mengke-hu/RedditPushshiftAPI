3 weeks in.

The only cigarette I crave is the one before bed.  I'm glad I quit.  I know it sounds corny but I quit because I decided to become my ultimate form.  I started my diet and excersise regiment a few days ago and I have a one year plan to get to my goal weight.  I just wanted to break free of the hardest addiction first, nicotine.   You guys have been alot of help and I appreciate the support.  I'm 30 and before I quit I smoked for 15 years.

how much do patches/gum cost?

i have to quit now because i go to basic training in 3 weeks and don't want to die lol. i've been smoking a pack a day for like 7 years and i don't know if i should buy the patches or the gum, i'm asking because i would probably do better with the gum because it's a replacement habit (chewing gum) but if it tastes bad it will not work.

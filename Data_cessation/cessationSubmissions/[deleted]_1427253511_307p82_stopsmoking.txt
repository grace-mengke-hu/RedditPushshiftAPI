Half way through my last pack ever!

I've been wanting to quit forever but it seems like when I get close to wanting to quit something stressful has happened or my depression made it feel impossible to quit. The only times I did quit it was mostly cold turkey or slowly cutting down both didn't work. This time I feel way more prepared I have a set day where I know when my last cigarette wil be and I am stockpiled with nicarette and patches.( thanks va) anyways I'm stoked to get on it! Wish me luck everyone!

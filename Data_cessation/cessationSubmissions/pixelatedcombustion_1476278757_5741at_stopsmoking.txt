Quit #76ish

Hello again. 

I quit this morning and I hope this time is the final time. I tried quitting cold turkey earlier this year and while I did not succeed, I learnt some valuable lessons on how to keep myself occupied. 

Since my earlier quit, a family member has been diagnosed with smoking related cancer. He is recovering after surgery but it's still pretty scary. The prospect of quitting is scary, but ultimately necessary. 

I used a patch this morning, but found myself getting frustrated and angry very easily. I received a job rejection letter which didn't help. I was SO close to walking to the shop for cigarettes but have dug out my ecig stuff instead, and it appears to be holding the anger at bay. 

My original plan was to use Champix/Chantix, though the possible neurological side effects have put me off it. I already have plenty of mental issues without adding another! 

So my updated plan is to start on 24mg ecig liquid, then go down to 16mg, then 8mg and finally 0mg. 

I can't help but feeling as though I am cheating with the ecig. I quit before with lozenges and found them just as hard as smoking to quit. Then again, I suppose ecigs are the lesser of two evils. My longest quit was three years, which was cold turkey, though I certainly can't do that while unemployed. 

Anyway, wish me luck! Not sure how to update my tracking thing on this sub so will sort it out when I get to a desktop PC, as on my mobile.

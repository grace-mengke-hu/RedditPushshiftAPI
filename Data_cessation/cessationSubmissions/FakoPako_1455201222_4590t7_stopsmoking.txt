Reminder: Be careful with triggers!!!!!

Woke up this morning thinking...I need some gas in my car, why not get a Sugar Free RedBull this fine February morning? It's been a while. Plus, I really needed some pick me up. 

So I went to my local gas station. I would go there everyday buying pack of smokes and a redbull. I filled my car up and walked inside. Right away, the owner saw me and says:" Heeeyyyy FakoPako! Haven't seen you in a while! Where have you been?!" and I said:" I quit smoking Mr. Gas Station...I don't have a need to come inside anymore!". He congratulated me and said "good job!". That felt really good! Other people start to notice!

I get my Sugar Free Redbull and get on my way...open it up in my car... OMG! It tastes sooooo good! I love the taste! It's been so freaking long since I had one.

Then all of the sudden, huge cravings for a cigarette! It was like a freaking rush. All I could think about was that I would smoke a cigarette, at this particular time, everyday, for as long as I can remember. This was the longest craving I had. It lasted for about 20 minutes. My mind would go nuts like there were two brains fighting with each other. One would say:" Oh man.. remember these good times? Smoking while sipping on that ice cold redbul on your drive to work?" when other one would say:" WTF are you thinking idiot! This shit sucks! Remember how bad you felt everyday? Look how great you feel now!".

I have to say, I will stay away from RedBull a little longer. Surprisingly, I had alcohol and didn't think about smoking at all. I guess RedBull is much bigger trigger for me. 

Keep tabs on your triggers kids! I did not expect such a strong urge to smoke today.

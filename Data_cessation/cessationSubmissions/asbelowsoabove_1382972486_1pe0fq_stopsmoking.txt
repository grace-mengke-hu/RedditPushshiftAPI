Two years sober. Now on to the next addiction.

I celebrated two years free of a drink or a drug on Saturday and my life is great. I just can't quit smoking. I've done it all, cold turkey, ecigs, menthol, non menthol, gum. Cold turkey worked for a few months but I didn't keep up the work.

I'm done. I hate that I can't do it. My gf smoked forever, and just quit (she uses ecigs, and I understand that they're not great but it's progress). I'm looking to just stop. Today. And I believe I can do it. I have fears about when someone, or a lot of people, might be all smoking around me. 

What do you say to that voice that says, "what's one more pack going to hurt?"

One week and it seems to be getting tougher

Stopped a week ago, just up and gave my pouch of tobacco away. Had two nights out since then and managed to stay away from having a cigarette. But since then its felt like "Well Ive lasted a week, one now wont mean Im addicted". Anyone else had this experience?

I don't think I crave the nicotine, but the relaxing feel of a smoke. What do you use to convince yourself not to reach for it?

I went 2 days, then relapsed, had two smokes, then went another 4 days and just relapsed.

I never really craved the nicotine I don't think, the 4 days were fine, I felt fine, didn't really feel like I needed it. I smoked 4-5 a day. 

But I just relapsed. I brougth a pack, smoked two, and then hated myself and got rid of it. Aside from feeling like I spent Â£10 on a 2 min cigarette break, I'm trying to understand what took me to it. I felt a craving for it, I wanted to relax with a smoke.

One of the things that always scared me about quitting was forever feeling like I was a 'quitter' - like I would be facing a desire to smoke for ever. It was a random comment somewhere I read where an ex-smoker said something like "Ignore people who say you still have cravings after a year, it's nowhere near the same as when you were smoking, and you can ignore it easily".

So people who have quit and have gone months without a smoke - tell me, now that you don't crave the nicotine, how do you psychologically stop yourself from reaching for a cigeratte? How do you convince yourself not to 'start' again? Afterall - I keep thinking I was a non-smoker who never really wanted to smoke, and then started. What if I do it again?

Thanks all.

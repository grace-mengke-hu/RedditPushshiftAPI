Quit date is tomorrow and I’m terrified

I’ve essentially quit already for the past few days, but still have a couple puffs a day in the morning or evening. It’s already miserable. Cravings are constant, I’m depressed as shit, I cant sleep, I’m jittery, I’m anxious. And then there’s the psychological factor - starting tomorrow, if all goes as planned, I will never have another smoke as long as I live. I’m only 22. That feels like eternity to keep quitting. Anyone got any advice?

About 24 hours in, feeling..... okay.

I've held strong so far and I'm feeling pretty proud of myself. I have wanted a cigarette extremely bad for the last few hours though. I said it in my post last night but I just feel ready this time. Here's to another night/day of discipline and self control. Also I'm a Bears fan so here's to a Packers L. Good luck everyone! Keep fighting the good fight!

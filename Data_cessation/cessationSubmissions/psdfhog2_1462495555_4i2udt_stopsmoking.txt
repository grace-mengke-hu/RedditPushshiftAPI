3 months. pissed off

Had the most intense craving out of nowhere today for a cigg. Worse than the first few weeks of quitting. Spent an hour and a half looking for my wallet (always get carded) and couldn't fucking find it. Just wanted one cig today, and now it's a bittersweet (more bitter) feeling that some magical force or random circumstances have prevented me from striking one up.

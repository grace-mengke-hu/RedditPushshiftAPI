72 hours in

Three solid days without smoking but I’m using the patch, it’s been almost too easy which is making me really quite nervous for when I eventually come off the patch.  This is my first attempt at quitting since I started smoking 7 years ago, any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Edit:  I see a lot of people mentioning Allen Carr’s book as a tool to quit, I looked it up on audible and there are numerous books by him about smoking, can anyone tell me the specific book that’s mentioned in the sub?

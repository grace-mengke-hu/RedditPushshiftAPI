55 hours in

55 hours smokefree, feeling fine at the moment although a bit snappy and on edge. Yesterday was really bad (especially due to it involving a long roadtrip), but I got trough it.  I've been having problems sleeping the last two nights. I feel a lot better today and I'm longing for tomorrow, hopefully then the urges have decreased to a level where I don't actively have to fight them every moment of my wakened hours..

My Father has smoked for the last 40 years, how do I help him make the decision to stop?

Hi Reddit! Lemme start by saying all of these posts about how you all have managed to quit, I applaud you. If I learned anything from my Dad it's that Nicotine can control you and it's not easy to give it up. So good on you for taking control of your life. 

Getting to the actual question, my Dad has been smoking for 40 years. And there's a lot of pressure in his life to stop. I know he doesn't want to, despite knowing it's bad for him. He's resorted to lying about it and using Gum/cologne to mask the smell. He's pretty open with me about it though. Problem is, he's still smoking a pack a day, and I think he's starting to believe his own lies that he's only smoking 1/2 a day. I work with him, so I see it throughout the day.  On top of that, hes started to cough a ton in the mornings and it's got me worried. If you have any suggestions or any input at all it would be appreciated. You guys are the experts. 

Also, if you want to share your stories on how you decided to quit, I would love to hear them. Have a good day!

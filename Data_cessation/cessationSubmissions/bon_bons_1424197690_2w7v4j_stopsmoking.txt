Best friend's wake, put my cat to sleep, didn't smoke

I don't know what my badge says ( on mobile, don't know if it's up to date) but I am two weeks past 6 months quit. This weekend was the longest of my life, and I stayed strong. I kind of owe it to posts like this, so I thought I'd post my own. Stay strong guys, cigarettes won't make your problems go away

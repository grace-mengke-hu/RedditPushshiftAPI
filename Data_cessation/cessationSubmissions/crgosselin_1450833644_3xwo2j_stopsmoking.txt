1 year (minus 10 days) - It gets easier

I was a pack a day for 8 years, 17-25 and have a massive addictive personality.  I quit January 2nd this year.  It gets a lot easier over time.


Yes I still want a smoke from time to time.

The craving intensities decrease the longer I go.
I still occasionally dream about cigarettes.

I had to quit drinking for the first 2 months as it was a trigger I couldn't beat right away.

When I wanted one really badly I'd sprint until I couldn't breathe and then chug a glass of water.
Avoid hanging out with your friends that smoke the first few months (they'll understand if they are actual friends).

No matter what comes up in life tell yourself bad shit is always going to happen and if you smoke every time something happens you'll never quit (yes it would probably help at that point in time but you will never quit if you can't deal with your problems without smoking)

When you're a few months in and wonder if one smoke would hurt remind yourself how far you've come and how angry you'll be if you restart (it's not worth the risk)

My girlfriend hated me the first month but dealt with it because she knew it'd end and loved me.  Tell those around you and they'll get it.

Some days I had such bad cravings I locked myself in my room and refused to get out of bed.

I'll field any questions.

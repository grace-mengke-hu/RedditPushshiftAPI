Havent decided to stop smoking completely

Hey guys im 21 and has smoked for about 3 years. My third year of smoking has been quite heavy, usually a pack a day. My life took a turn when i started smoking. And that means my lifestyle, my study habits and also my circle of friends. Most of my friends are smokers and 2 out of 3 of my best friends are also smokers. So 8 days ago i took the initiative to stop smoking and hasnt smoked since. This was also supported by the incident in which i got caught by my mother who smelled my shirt that stenched in cigarette smoke. But now im having second thoughts about whether I should stop smoking completely or put the trust in myself to only smoke socially. The reason to this is because i cherish the smoking sessions i have with my close friends and hanging out wouldnt be the same anymore without a cigarette in my hand. Changing friends is out of the question. Really appreciate your advice on this.

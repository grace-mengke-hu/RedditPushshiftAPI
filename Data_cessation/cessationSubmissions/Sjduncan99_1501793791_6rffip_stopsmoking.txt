Anyone use Zyban?

I was prescribed Zyban to help me quit smoking but the fear of side effects has me more anxious than quitting smoking (odd, I know). I had my last cigarette on the 1st and even though the cravings aren't easy to get through, I feel like it's best to just go cold turkey. I tried Zyban way back in 2003 and I remember it altering my moods in a bad way. 

If you've taken Zyban, do the benefits outweigh the side effects?

i just passed 7 days... and i still prefer death.

this is no joke.  why sacrifice my mental health?  i hate life without cigarettes.  it is miserable.  absolute crushing depression.  i am going to go 14 days, and if this awful hopelessness doesn't subside, i will start smoking again, and die young.  and happily mind you.  i simply cannot tolerate this weight of living with such intolerable want.  i still have my youth. i want to enjoy my youth.  i am a happy person. but apparently happy only with cigarettes.  why waste my youth in suffering without tobacco?  my addiction runs so deep, that life simply is vacant without it.  7 more days of hating myself and this world, then it's back to the bliss of smoking tobacco.  if it subsides, dear god that would be glorious.  but i do not see this happening.  i simply hate everything for depriving myself of smoking and as of now, i prefer a young death than to suffer through this.

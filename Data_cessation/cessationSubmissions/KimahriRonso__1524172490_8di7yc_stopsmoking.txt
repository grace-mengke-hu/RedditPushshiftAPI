101 Days without an ounce of nicotine!!

When I first started I made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7p6vin/see_you_in_a_100_days/

Now 101 days later, I feel amazing, fulfilled, driven; Quitting smoking has been one of the hardest things I have ever done, but it is so worth it.  A few quick updates; buffer as I am going to gym more, have a girlfriend for 2 months now, and I have used my new found energy to work and discipline myself to become a greater version of myself!!

Thank you all in this forum, because your help has been immense these past 3 and a half months. And new quitters, the journey might seem long, but just after a short while, you will see the impact of your actions.

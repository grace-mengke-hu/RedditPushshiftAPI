Anyone familiar with discontinued Nicorette Lozenges?

I had an interesting day folks. I went into my local walgreens and like always I check the bargain bin in the back. Lo and behold I find a box of Nicorette 2mg lozenges 108 ct. for $3. Obviously I bought then. Sounds too good to be true right? Well here is the receipt (note the original price on the left): http://imgur.com/CbSLMB3

But it gets better! I go home still in shock and check on ebay to see about what a box of these sells for. I was shocked to see that the same product I have has a listing with a bid at $250! Seen here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nicorette-Lozenges-2mg-Original-/252055898211?hash=item3aafb3c863

I could not believe my eyes. Immediately I listed my item with a buy it now price of $215. It sold in under five minutes. Buyer has already paid. So it appears I hit the jackpot.

So my question is... can anybody tell me about this product http://imgur.com/wL1iLvb and why people are spending an outrageous amount of money on it? It seems to me that it may be discontinued and swapped for a newer nicorette lozenge; but what makes these so special compared to the new style?

I have tried the new mini lozenges and I personally did not care for them too much. I have never tried the old formula type so I am just trying to gain a little bit of insight as to what the big deal is?

Also PSA: go check your bargain bin at your local walgreens- you might get lucky.

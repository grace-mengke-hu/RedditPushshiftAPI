Coughing up clear phlegm with brown spots in it, very fine and few, anyone else experience this?

I must admit i'm freaking out, this has been on and off over the last year, i'd say once every 4 months, i'd cough up this clear phlegm with light brown spots in it, some streaking, I've asked friends and they've said they haven't had this, just wondering if i'm alone in this?
going for an chest xray soon just in case, but would like to know if this is common?
(btw I quit smoking 6 months ago with a few unfortunate relapses)

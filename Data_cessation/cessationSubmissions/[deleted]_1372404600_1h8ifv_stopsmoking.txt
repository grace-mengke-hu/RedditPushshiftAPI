My reminder.

I quit smoking three weeks ago, but today I smoked. Immediately after the first puff my throat closed up, I got a headache, and just all around did not feel good. I'm very unhappy with myself and the worst part was I wasn't even giving into a craving. I was over cravings, but boredom overtook me and my cousin offered me a cigarette and instead of declining in my usual fashion, I accepted. I am making this post as a reminder to myself and anyone thinking about smoking again.

Don't do it. If you get bored, do some exercise. If you have down time and think about smoking, fill it. It's not worth picking up that smoke again and restarting the healing process. You felt better without them, the only reason you'd have to start again is because you forgot how bad it feels to put that into your body.

when (if ever) is it time to go inpatient?

hey all

i am having a rough morning... i had plans to quit smoking my juul today, for good. i’ve been addicted to it ever since i “quit smoking” by switching from cigs to the juul, totally unaware of popcorn lung and the hiked up levels of nicotine. 

i didn’t make it two hours before i was having heart palpitations, nausea, dangerously violent irritability, and suicidal thoughts. 

i feel like i’m just weak and making excuses, so please help me out here

anybody else tried to quit smoking/vaping juul pods? i don’t want to smoke anything, not even 0% vapor at the end of this. 

seriously though. i feel like if i really wanted to quit i would truly have to be locked up under medical supervision.

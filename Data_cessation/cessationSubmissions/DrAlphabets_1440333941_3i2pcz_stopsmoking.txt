My brother almost broke down the other day

He just finished his classes for the summer semester and feels like he aced all his finals so he bought himself one of those little cigarillos to celebrate. I told him, "man that's how it starts. you've gone two months, best you've ever done. Please don't throw it away because of this."

He was upset for a bit but we ultimately took the dogs for a run instead. Much better.

Few days later and that cigarillo is still sitting on the counter. Great work brother

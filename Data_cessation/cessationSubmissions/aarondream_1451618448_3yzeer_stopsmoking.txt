It's been 91 days now.

I decided to quit on October 1st 2015. It was my new years resolution at the beginning of 2015 but I waited until October to finally commit. Guys, I just want to encourage you to quit this bad habit. If this is on your new years resolution list, then do it. I believe in everyone of you who wants to quit. 

Reddit helped me and so did this app called quit now. I encourage everyone to check it out. Best of luck to everyone!!!

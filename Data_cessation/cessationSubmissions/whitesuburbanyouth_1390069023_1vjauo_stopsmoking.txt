Need some advice

So stupidly I found myself becoming a fulltime smoker about 3 months ago. I always smoked when I drank and it kind of escalated from there. I felt bad for always bumming cigarettes off my friends at parties so I bought my own. Of course I told myself I wouldn't smoke any unless I was with company, and of course that plan didn't work out as well as I had hoped. 

So here I am in a position that I had always told myself I wouldn't end up in, I'm addicted to cigarettes. 

I have read Alan Carr's "Easy Way" and found it didn't really have much impact on me. I found it hard to related to since I have only been smoking for such a short time and haven't really come across many of the examples he writes of in the book. That and I found it a tad repetitive and very hard to read.

Any advice on how I should get started? I have about 3 smokes left in my current pack and plan not to buy another.

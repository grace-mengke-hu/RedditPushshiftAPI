Been Away a Little While. Our Cat Passed Away.

Hello everyone. I just wanted to make a little post, if for nothing else, to just help myself try to feel a little better.

I haven't been very active on this subreddit recently. Busy at work and stuff.

On Tuesday, our eldest cat, Bauer, passed away. He was 15 years old. He had been sick for a while but he was eating as much as he could, and my fiancee was administering fluids nightly. He was doing better... we of course knew he was not well... but it was still a shock. He was alert and ate lots of food Tuesday morning and was relaxed and comfortable as usual.

I got home on Tuesday evening and found him. He had passed away while we were at work. 

It has been very difficult. We miss him very much. Our other cats are getting lots of extra special attention and love. Frodo has especially been doing his best to comfort me.

To everyone who has offered support and kind words in my endeavor to stay away from smoking... thank you. Tomorrow is day 150 for me and I still have not smoked.

To anyone who had milestones or stories that I missed, please forgive me. I'm proud of everyone who continues to fight. This is a great subreddit, and everyone is really awesome and supportive. Thank you.

Here are a few pictures of Bauer... a great kitty and great friend:

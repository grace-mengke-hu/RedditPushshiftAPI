Checking in. Almost 4 years quit after 28 years smoking.

You guys can do it. At this point I cant even understand why it took so long to quit. Seems easy now. 

Vaped with nic for 30 days then quit the vape after 60. Cold turkey ever since. It took about a year for the cravings to go away and probably that long for the dreams to stop. Now most of my friends don't even know that I ever smoked. I am "mr healthy" to them. 

Hang in there you all. this sub is great. For those that dont have a badge....get one. it helped me because I didnt want to cheat and have to reset it.

good luck!

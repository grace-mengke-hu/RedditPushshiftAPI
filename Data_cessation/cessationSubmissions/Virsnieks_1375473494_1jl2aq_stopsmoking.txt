New quitter

hello, 
I'm new here. Finally trying to get rid of smoking for my life. I was 10+years smoker. Now I'm on day 7.
Some days ago I went and bought pack of cancer-sticks. Later I trow them away. This happened twice this week but I'm happy spending my money but not smoking that shit. Can't believe I did this more than 10 years. 
I'm happy to find this subreddit so I hope I can get some motivation here when I'll have hard times to resist urges to smoke.

Keep going guys.

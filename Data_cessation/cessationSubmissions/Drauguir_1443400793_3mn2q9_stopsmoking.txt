Exposing my Craving

Today I'm having a huge craving due to certain...things happening in my life, which are causing me stress. Not "bad, terrible" stress, just normal stress, from everyday work and relationship with different people. 

Today I was thinking: what about having one, JUST one? It wouldn't hurt, right? It will fix this craving and I'll feel more relaxed. 

Then I thought about past situations when I was stressed. And I've been in the same situation multiple times, hundreds of times, when I was smoking. The only difference? I had a fucking cigarrette in my hand. So it's a trick, a brain trick. I won't fall for it. Lately my social circle have broaden up, I work harder and in a more enthusiastic way, I feel more energized, I do sport everyday (go running), I'm more comfortable around girls (before, I had even given up about flirting), and my mindset is, most of the time, much more positive.

So, why do I think a cigarrette would improve my mood? 

It's just the shitty circle wanting to restart again. Going back to routine, to being a lazy ass, to smoking and waste time while doing it. It's just a will to go back to my bubble of comfort. I think those are the mechanics of this craving and I'm not going to fall for it.

Craving, you can suck my ass.

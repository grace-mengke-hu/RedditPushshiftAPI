Hey ya'll

I didn't think it was possible, but I did it, 23 days without a cigarrette! So as some of you will know me, I sort of well.... "trolled" this subreddit like three to four months ago (I will not provide a link, search through my history if you like). I apologise for my behaviour towards the people of this subreddit. I truely appreciate the struggle that each of you has gone through to make a better life for yourselves and I also appreciate each and everyone of you for dedicating your time and energy in helping people quit smoking. My actions were dictated by a strong belief about how it is impossible to quit smoking and were reaffirmed by skepticism for people on the internet claiming to quit smoking. Again I apologise for my narrow-mindedness and appreciate your actions. I hope to contribute to this subreddit and hope you will find it in your hearts to forgive me, especially you /u/EntAway.

Yeah buddy!

Hi reddit, I'm 19 years old and been smoking in weekends and at parties since I was like 15, started smoking regularly since I was 17/18. Smoked 3/4 packs a week, so (luckily) I was not a hardened veteran, but addicted surely. Decided to quit smoking on the 1st of January, but this time it was different. I have tried to quit before but everytime the weekend came up or a buddy said "Yeah you're surely gonna smoke at that party/that vacation" I was like "Yeah you're right" and lit one up. It was always alcohol that fucked my stopping attempt. But this time I stopped lying to myself about how chill smoking was. BE RATIONAL! It costs a lot of money (Here in the Netherlands), bad for your health, bad breath, fucks up your shaping, yellow teeth, only feels chill because the last cig made you feel like you needed another one. Like there is a 1000 good reasons to quit and not a single good reason to keep smoking. And if you don't see that, you're addicted! Even if you don't smoke a lot. But okay back to why I started this post, last night I got drunk AF (which would normally result in me smoking a cig if I were quitting) but I didn't! Kinda proud of myself :)! I know that for me it isn't as hard as for some other smokers around here, but i learned that it all started with the mindset. You've gotta CONVINCE yourself time and time again that you are not a smoker and that it's a fucked up drug. And you don't have to miss the small moments with your friends, I still go outside with them sometimes, but I just don't smoke. Goodluck to all of you!

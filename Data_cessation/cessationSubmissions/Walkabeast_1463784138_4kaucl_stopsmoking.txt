Expired Nicotine patches

I impulsively decided to try and quit smoking, and this time it has stuck around longer than most of my attempts.  Using those CLEAR nicotine patches I bought on a previous attempt, and despite them being expired for well over a year, work just fine. 

In fact the nicotine patches recommend a 3 step dosage, step 1 being the longest with the highest amount of nicotine in the patch, step 2 and 3 being much shorter with much less nicotine in them. I was all out of step 1 so I just started with step 2, and while some cravings were present, still completely manageable. I'm now on the step 3 patches which are tiny, and fairly confident that I won't be needing the patches for much longer.

TL;DR: Don't be afraid to use expired nicotine patches

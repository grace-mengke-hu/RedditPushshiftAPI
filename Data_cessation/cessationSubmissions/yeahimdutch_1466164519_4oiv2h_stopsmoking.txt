I'm SO ANGRY

Hi guys,

Just a bit of a rant, the quit is going good, haven't slipped. But I'm so angry all the time it's annoying. I'm also not that nice to my girlfriend :( she can't do anything about it.

The brain fog I have is also shitty, I feel stupid, stupid and angry at the same time. 

Fuck nicotine, I'm going to chop down a tree or something...

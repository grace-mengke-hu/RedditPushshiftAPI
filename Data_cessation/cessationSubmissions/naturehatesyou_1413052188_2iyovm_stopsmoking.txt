Smoked my first pack in a year. Makes me feel "normal". Need advice.

Hey, y'all. I was a smoker for eight years before quitting about a year ago. Last weekend I had some stress going on and bought a pack of cigs. What I noticed was smoking made me feel like a normal, mellow, level-headed human being. This is bad news since I have no desire to continue, but I was wondering if anyone else has this same problem. I fear I did permanent damage to my neurology since I smoked from age 19 to age 28. Perhaps there are other avenues (meditation, exercise, etc.) to maintaining healthy dopamine levels. Any thoughts? 

Thanks as always, kind strangers of the internet.

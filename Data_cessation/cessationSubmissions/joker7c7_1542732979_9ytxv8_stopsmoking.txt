Hey guys is it considered a progress if I just switched to vaping?

I mean... I basically have no desire to smoke, and before this I smoke 2 packs+ per day.
I wouldnt call it quit smoking, but its alright to feel that I have achieved something....right?
Anyway I think Im gonna stick with vaping for a while then think about what to do next. Just wandering if its a good idea.

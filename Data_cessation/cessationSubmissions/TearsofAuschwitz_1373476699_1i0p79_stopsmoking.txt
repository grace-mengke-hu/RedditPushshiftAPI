Quit smoking 6 weeks ago. Still feeling depressed. Any advice from ex-smokers?

I started smoking 4 years ago and quit at the end of May (6 weeks), for what I hope is the last time. Although they didn't serve any purpose initially, cigarettes eventually became my means of focusing, motivating, and suppressing emotion. At the end, however, smoking didn't even do that. I decided to quit and really commit. I got over the physical withdrawal within a day and the deep, depressive mood within 10 days (normal pattern for me). However, I'm still suffering from total apathy and lack of motivation. I can't really focus. I rarely leave my house anymore. I'm not really sad (maybe a little), mostly completely empty. I was wondering if any of you had had similar experiences and how you dealt with them. More specifically, will this feeling naturally fade with time? Are there steps or other lifestyle changes I should consider? **OR** will *medication* help? I've been looking into anti-depressants for smoking cessation (**bupropion**) and considering that option, but don't really want to become dependent on another substance. Any advice?

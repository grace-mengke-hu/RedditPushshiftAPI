Thoughts on using a disposable Ecig for cravings?

I was at the gas station about a month ago and got a free "ecig" thing. Kind of like the BLU cigarette. I had it in my bag forever without using it and im now on day 2 with no cigarettes. That thing is taunting me and I don't know if I should use that for when my cravings get really bad because I know they will be worse than they are now. I don't plan on making it a habit and to consistently use it but wanted to know about your thoughts and experience.

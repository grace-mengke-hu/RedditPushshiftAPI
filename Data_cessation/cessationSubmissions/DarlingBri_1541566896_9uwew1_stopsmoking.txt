After 30 years, I quit smoking one year ago. I never thought this anniversary would come. What I learned is that you don't need to believe you can do it, you just need to keep doing it.

That's it, really. I would never have believed I would make it a year. But you don't need to make it a year; you just need to make it for an hour, repeatedly. 

And honestly I still want a cigarette every day but I am never going back because I am not throwing this year away.

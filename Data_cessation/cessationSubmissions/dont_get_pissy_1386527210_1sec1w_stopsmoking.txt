OK, you guys have finally worn me down.

Quitting has been gnawing at me for two years now.  Tried the patch, then the gum, still smoking.  Considering the e-cig though.  For now I am taking a (huge for me) step and cutting my smoking in half.  I used to smoke in one room in the house.  But it is the same room my computer is in.  Yeah a quick cig, then start browsing reddit, 4 cigs later....  Bad cycle.  Just putting my cigarettes in the grill outside has cut the chain smoking dramatically.  I am under a pack a day for the first time in 3-4 years.  I am getting there folks, I hope to be able to celebrate a year + with you great people.  Thanks for the inspiration, and a little guilt too.

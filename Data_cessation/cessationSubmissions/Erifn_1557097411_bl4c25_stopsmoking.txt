Day 4 done

Day 4 completed - of no cigarettes and no nicotine - and I’m feeling really good. I’ve tried to quit before but I feel stronger this time - like something has clicked for me. In the months leading up to quitting, I’ve been exercising regularly, meditating every day and eating well.  It’s made a difference for me. Good luck everyone...

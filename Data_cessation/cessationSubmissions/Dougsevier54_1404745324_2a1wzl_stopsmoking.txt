Checking back in.

Well, it has been 155 days now, since I quit smoking. I could NOT be happier with my decision.

I am saying this with 100% honesty, I only checked in to see how many days it has been (my flair lol). I have not even thought about having a cigarette in at least 90 days. It never even crosses my mind. 

I wish I  could explain how/why. I know that there are tons of people out there that try and want to quit, but can never seem to let it go. I wish it were as easy for everyone as it has been (so far) for me. 

After 14 years of 1 pack +/day, I quit in ~2 weeks.

Yes, I used Chantix. No, I had no notable side effects. 

Keep the right attitude, and stay your course! YOU CAN DO IT!!

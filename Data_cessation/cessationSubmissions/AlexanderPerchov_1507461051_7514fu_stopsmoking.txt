Quitting tomorrow

Someone very close to me just witnessed the death of someone. That person dies of lung cancer. That's it. 

I have been thinking about quitting for some time now, and am still doubtful I can make. I feel like I lack some kind of actual internalized motivation, my specific reasons to quit (weirdly money and death don't work). I will make a list later today, to help me to remember the reasons and I will add a non-smoking thread to my journal tomorrow. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, like what were your reasons to ultimately decide to quit, and what helped you to get over the doubts? 

Thanks everyone

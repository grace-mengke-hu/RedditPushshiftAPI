100 hours and it keeps getting better. Thank you.

Hi guys, I am very thankful for all your support. It has been 100 hours since I had my last half cigarette and about 9 days since I quote from 30 a day to 0 cold turkey. It is BEAUTIFUL. Most of the day I do not feel like smoking and I have been waiting for five minutes whenever I get the feeling and it goes away. Keeping myself busy helps. Also had my wisdom teeth extracted yesterday and I am so happy that I am not getting usual cravings. ( dry socket go to hell haha). I really hope this workes out. Thank you guys. You got a great community going here. â˜®ðŸ˜Š

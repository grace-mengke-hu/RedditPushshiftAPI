I failed and could use some advice.

So I nearly made it to 3 days the first attempt. But then I smoked one cigarette on a drunk evening. Then I smoked one the next day... and I smoked one earlier. Always when I walk home alone from a fun evening. I have managed to cut down heavily (no cigarettes in my house) but that one or two daily cigarettes always get me... and I know if I keep smoking one daily, my rationalisation will keep fucking with me and before long I will smoke more.

 any tips on how I can do that last, final stretch?

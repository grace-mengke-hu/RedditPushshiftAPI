A shallow, raspy breath before the plunge.

For the past nine years, I've told myself that I'm not a "smoker," because I only smoke when I'm at work/when I'm in trial/when I'm stressed/when I have a deadline. But now I've realized that I'm a lawyer, and I will always, in perpetuity, be in one of these positions. My cough is obvious and embarrassing, and I have a kid on the way. 

And so I begin with day 1. Manic pacing is a poor substitute for nicotine. Wish me luck.

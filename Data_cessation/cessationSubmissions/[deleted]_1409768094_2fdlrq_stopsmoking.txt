I Had To Restart My Badge

But! I am now at the point where I can go out and not crave a cig! My job and location enables me to go out drinking quite frequently, and because of that I was so used to drinking and smoking going hand in hand. When I initially quit, I cheated by bumming from friends because I'd be craving them while I was out drinking. I am so happy to say that I no longer have that craving. I visited New Orleans this weekend and was surrounded by people smoking and didn't even have second thoughts about it! It's a good place to be!

Any other quitters dealing with Depression?

I've been on and off antidepressants for a few years, and have been reading how the proportion of smokers among individuals with depression is significantly higher (about 47%) and the success of quitting is significantly lower.  
  
Anyone else dealing with depression? Any tips for making quitting successful in spite of it?

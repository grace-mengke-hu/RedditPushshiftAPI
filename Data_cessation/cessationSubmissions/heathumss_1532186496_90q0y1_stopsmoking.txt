I want to quit!!

I’ve been a smoker since I was 12. I started regularly at 15. I have quit cold turkey before and it lasted a year. My main “excuse” is that My life is shitty and always has been so I should be entitled to smoke because I was blessed with a subpar life. I enjoy smoking but I want to quit because it is socially acceptable to quit and YES I do care about what others think of me plus my family will be healthier. Has anyone struggled wit the same excuses I have? I feel low and therefore I should smoke and whatever I hate my life anyways.  I want to quit cold turkey. I Know that I just HAVE to not smoke. Will it get better?

A letter I wrote to myself

I wrote this letter to myself a few days ago, and it is still in action:

Dear Self,

Notice how much stress and anxiousness is developing in your body and mind.  You know, that feeling of “Let’s go, let’s go!” and feeling like you are running out of time and trying to get somewhere.  This is the main source of this false belief of trying to be somewhere and running out of time.  It keeps you from being in the moment.  I know you were planning on letting go of the nicotine the whole time, but now is the time.  You don’t need to put yourself through more stress. This is the time to let go of your cigarette use. This discomfort will be a thing of the past. 

You may be operating at what you believe is a justifiable “OK” state of mind.  But you need to realize that underlying your consciousness there is a lot of pressure accruing.  This pressure is pure negative energy and its outlet is very small.  Therefore I have a dangerous situation and need to abort the cigarettes as SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I understand that this particular week there are some busy events planned, so smoke accordingly.  However, this Thursday needs to be the last day.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will be days of withdrawal and annoyance for sure, but can be toned down with release of dopamine via binaural beats (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EQR0hMFbsk) or simply an orgasm.  This is also the time to start exercising on a daily basis.   Look forward to your new, fresh days.

Love, 
Self

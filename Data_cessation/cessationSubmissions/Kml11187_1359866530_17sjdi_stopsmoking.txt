Help me really quit this time!!!

I am a 26 year old female who has been smoking on and off since I was 15. I have quit before but usually only for short periods of time. As soon as something stressful in my life happens I run to the store and buy a pack. For some reason this time seems harder then the last few times I quit. It's been 48 hours since my last cigarette and I just want one so bad! I really do want to quit, not just for the fact that it's expensive ($12 a pack) and its unhealthy obviously! BUT most of all my wife and I want to start trying to have a baby at the end of this year so I would like to be smoke free for a good amout of time before that time comes. Please help me get through this!!! Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!
P.S. I am using the patch currently, and just signed up for a gym membership I hope they both help!

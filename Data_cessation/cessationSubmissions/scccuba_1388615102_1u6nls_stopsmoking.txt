Minor relapse - need advice

Hey guys. About three years ago I quit completely cold turkey. It was really successful. I had smoked for 5 years on and off (started as a teen, quit at around 21 years old). I became really athletic and healthy.

I'm back in my hometown for the holidays and started going out a lot, and having a noticeably less healthy lifestyle. A lot more drinking, a lot more frequently.

The other day I succumbed to a cigarette being offered by a girl I was flirting with. Ever since I've noticed that every time I go out I smoke a few cigarettes socially. I've probably smoked 10 cigarettes total.

I have no cravings whatsoever when I'm not going out, but I'm concerned that this new "social smoking" is going to get out of control. I'm also concerned about these last few cigarettes fucking up my health and my athletic ability, so I'm worrying a lot more.

Any advice from people that have had a relapse like this and continued smoke-free again would be really helpful. I suspect that quitting alcohol is probably the right thing to do in this situation.

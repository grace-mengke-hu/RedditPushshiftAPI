Who became a sexy jogger that doesn't break a sweat?

So, for 25 days I've substituted chain-smoking with binge-eating.  

I tried week one of the C25K app before, when I still had nicotine in place of my hormones and I just barely finished a day. 


I was that sweaty, heaving monster that drooled after a minute of running. The blood was pumping in my head so hard, I had blurry vision and what they called "optimized breathing" or "getting in the rhythm" was some sort of cosmic joke to me. I was ashamed of how struggling I looked so I went to "run" only in the dark hours of the day.

Today I started the C25K app again and dove directly into week 3.

Today, after 0 exercise and extra weight, I suddenly turned into a graceful jogger and sweat, ever-so-slightly, just to accentuate the fact that I'm a goddess!!! Those 30 minutes passed by swiftly and at the end of it I was contemplating how somebody should put me in movies to run in the background of the frame. 

Seriously, I can't believe how much I have been crippling myself all my life without even realizing it. Lets never return to that grayish mist of procrastination and lies!!!

If my body can regenerate this much and that fast, yours can too!

I've managed cold turkey this far and I've smoked more than half of my life. Since I can do that you can do it too!!! 

Thank you for the attention, now I'll go eat something :]

Two weeks today but having really tough day.

Today is my two weeks of being quit. It was obviously hard. I used the patches but I smoked on my two 21mg patches and only had 3 days of being smoke free on them. I'm almost done with my 14mg but then it's down to 7mg. It's a super stressful time right now due to final exams and big tests in nursing school. I just found out my dad went back to smoking and we were supposed to be quitting together. Today I am feeling depressed, stressed, exhausted and while I'm not having a physical craving I'm just psychologically worn down. Part of me doesn't wanna ruin this streak and go back but when I smell a cigarette on campus or from my dad or even if I don't part of me just wants to give up and go back. Sorry for the long post but even though I know what I should do, I just don't wanna feel this way anymore.

2 years nicotine free!

I hit the 2 year mark at about 4:30 this morning! For those of you who just began your journey, stick with it and keep coming back here for support and to support others. Even if you're early on in your quit, you're still an inspiration to others who have quit more recently, and offering that support will motivate you to stay smoke free as well.

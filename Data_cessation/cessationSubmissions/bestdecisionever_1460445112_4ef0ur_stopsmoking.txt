Will not smoke again

I don't remember the date I picked up smoking, but its been at least 10 years. I am quitting smoking today, and I am now a non-smoker. The following are the rules that I need to remember..

* 1. Took a vow that I will not smoke again
* 2. Best decision ever, no regretting.
* 3. Will not envy those smoking. 
* 4. Haven't given up anything. I know its hurting my health and I will now strive to get better every hour and day from now on
* 5. Will use the money saved for something better.
* 6. Enjoy the cravings. They are signs that your body is getting better.
* 7. There is no thing as 'Just 1 cigarette'. Not even on special occasions. The moment I light a cigarette, I am a smoker again.
* 8. Starve the nicotine monster to death.
* 9. I am a non smoker.

Question: When I get a craving, what should I do to get myself better? I am thinking, drinking a glass of water. Any suggestions?

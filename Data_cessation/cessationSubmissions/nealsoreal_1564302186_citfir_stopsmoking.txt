I made it 6 whole months... then I got a juul. Now I’m addicted again. Can’t seem to get the motivation back after failing so bad.

Really feeling shitty about it and having a hard time getting back the motivation to quit.

I was totally fine. I thought it was going to be easy after I made it through the first month. Barely any cravings at all. I was living nicotine free.

And then I had one bad day. A fight with my family, which is a massive trigger for me to use nicotine. It’s like an act of rebellion, because they don’t approve.

I convinced myself it was either a juul or a pack of cigarettes. So I got a juul. And then I just kept getting refills, because I already made the investment... and then a month flew by and my nicotine addiction creeped back in. Just like that. I’m right back where I fucking started.

I get down on myself when I think about it. That makes it hard to even get to a place where I want to quit again.

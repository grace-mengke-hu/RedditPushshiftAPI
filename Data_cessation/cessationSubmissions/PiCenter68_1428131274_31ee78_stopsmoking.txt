I'm *trying* to quit

I'm also gonna *try* to walk outside; I'm gonna *try* to eat lunch; I'm gonna *try* to put on my clothes. I dont have much confidence in myself so I make sure to tell everyone that that I'm only going to *try* to do the things that intend to do. Seriously though, I've decided that I've quit, and future me is just going to have to deal with it.

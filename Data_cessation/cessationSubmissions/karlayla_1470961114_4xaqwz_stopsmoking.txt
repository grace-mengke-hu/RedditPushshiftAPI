I was told I don't look like a smoker today

I went in to donate plasma today and had to speak to a nurse about high heart rate. One of the questions she asked was do I smoke, to which I answered, "No." She then said, "Yeah, you don't look like smoker." I was going to tell her that I used to, but she went straight away to other questions. It's all in my file there that I used to, and I knew that wouldn't have been the reason for the high heart rate anyway, so I let it be. But I still felt extremely happy at that comment.

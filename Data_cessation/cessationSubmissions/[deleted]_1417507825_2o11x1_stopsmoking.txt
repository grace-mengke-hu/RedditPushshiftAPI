I feel like I am going to rip someone's head off

So I finished smoking my last cigarette just before midnight set in on November 29th, going into the 30th.  Tonight, for some reason, I feel like I want to rip someone's head off.  I feel like I am going to climb the walls.  I know that I just need to stay focused and that this will pass, but OMG, the cravings right now are soooooooooooo intense.

Looking forward to this weekend's challenge

Hi, I'm at 2 weeks as of yesterday - this came after a relapse which saw me throw 2 months down the toilet. HOWEVER, it's different this time. In all of that two months I never had my biggest trigger/temptation to deal with. 

I've always found it ridiculously hard to spend a weekend alone without drinking and smoking. In those two months I didn't have any weekends when my GF wasn't around, so I didn't have to face that. First time she went away, I smoked. Now... she's away this weekend. But I am actually looking forward to going through it smoke-free. I'm gonna have a few beers too - because I like to drink, and there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do that without smoking. 

In the past I would be sat there on a tuesday or a wednesday, worried about the upcoming lonesome weekend - knowing that over that weekend I would fail, so I might as well just start smoking again immediately. Now I'm looking at that weekend and thinking about all the sport and movies I'm gonna watch, without smoking. I *know* that this time I'll be successful because I've decided to be. I've decided that I'm going to enjoy the weekend, and that all those weekends I spent smoking were serious wastes of time and money.

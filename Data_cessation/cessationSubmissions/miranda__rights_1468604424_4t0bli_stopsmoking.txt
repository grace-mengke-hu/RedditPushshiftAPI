A pretty big victory for me -- even though it might sound a bit small. :)

I used to always come out on my deck/porch/what-have-you for a cigarette. Always, like, multiple times a day. It was my **spot**, you know? Well, today I'm "reclaiming" it. Doing it right now, haha. Sitting in the shade with a smoothie, my laptop, and Netflix. There's also a Pokestop right near me so that's a plus.

Basically, I've noticed when you stop associating smoking with other things, the other things become more enjoyable (i.e. no more accidentally ashing on my keyboard :P ). 

What are some of your success stories when it comes to breaking cigarette associations like this? I'd love to hear 'em!

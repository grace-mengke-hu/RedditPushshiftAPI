I've been shit

I made it to 2 weeks. It was easy I was cocky. I caved and have continued to do so. I should be at a month. Just about to have my last few and then soak the rest of the pack. I'm getting really bored of myself stopping and starting but one of these times will be the last time I stop. Please let it be this one. Let's go team!!

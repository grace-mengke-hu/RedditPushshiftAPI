Day .5

Well I'm halfway through my ten hour shift at work.  My last cigarette was at about 8:30am and its 3.15.

I'm a pack a day smoker who has been frustrated with myself for the past 2 years of my life for not being able to quit, tried cold turkey, gum, vaping nothing worked for long but today I'm doing it for real.

I'm starting the patch regimine and about 6 hours in I'm feeling really good about it and thought making a post here would help hold myself accountable and reading the posts here really gave me motivation.

Here we go!,

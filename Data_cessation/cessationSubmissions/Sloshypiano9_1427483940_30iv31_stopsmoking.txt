Four days in

Packed up smoking Monday after 35 years of smoking 20+ a day,apart from one day where I left work early & went straight to bed in the middle of the afternoon(only place I could trust myself not to buy cigarettes)it's been okayish,vaping & on 21mg patches but although people say well done etc (which is nice) I really feel I have achieved something & can't wait for Monday morning when I have made it a week,really wanna be free of smoking

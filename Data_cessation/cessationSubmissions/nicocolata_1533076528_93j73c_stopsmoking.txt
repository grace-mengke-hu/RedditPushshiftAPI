Quitting vaping 1 1/2 years after I quit smoking cigarettes!

So, I quit smoking cigarettes a little over 1 1/2 years ago, but picked up vaping about 7 months ago when I worked in a restaurant. I smoked a Juul and I could see the effects of nicotine in my complexion, in the headaches and stomachaches I would have, the way it drained my wallet, and the anxiety of not being able to find it. I am on day two, and honestly it hasn’t been as difficult as it was to quit cigarettes, but not exactly easy either. I’m a little foggy in the head and want to eat everything. I made some healthy chicken soup so I can just eat if I need to, as well as packs of gum (no nicotine) since I gained 30 pounds I’m still trying to get off slowly but surely after quitting cigarettes. Cheers to everyone fighting their battles to quit! We deserve better! Good luck!!

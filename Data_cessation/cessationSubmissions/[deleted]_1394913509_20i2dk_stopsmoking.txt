Took my 32 day badge off today. Relapses really hurt.

Well, I quit with my fiance on Feb. 11th. I got a part time job and would notice the stench of cigarettes when I'd get in the vehicle when he'd pick me up. He started smoking mini cigars. It started like that. 

I had one. not in hailing but having the smoke in my mouth was enough. 



And then, I found a god damn pack of smokes in our back seat that his friend accidentally left.


We smoked them.



I feel like a huge peice of garbage.


I was talking to my mom about how fantastic I was feeling and she said "1OOO1OO1O1 I'm going to quit on Monday." Whether my fiance is still smoking or not, I will be trying again on Monday with my mom who is 8 hours away.

Nausea from quitting

Currently 5 days and 11 hours smoke free after 8 years of smoking. I’m a non-smoker! Since yesterday, I’ve been feeling really nauseous. I’ve read that the nausea is a withdrawal side effect from quitting. Does anyone know why this is? I really don’t mind it because the nausea actually turns away my cravings because I feel so unwell. I’m just more curious as to why my body feels this way. Anyone else have side effects like this? 

For those of you having any side effects from quitting, keep on pushing through! The side effects will only last a little while and the benefits from quitting will be so much greater!

The first 24 hours are behind me. This is miserable.

Hey All,

I've been a daily smoker / vaper for the past 15 years. Time to give it up. My last inhalation of any sort of nicotine product was approximately 24 hours ago. I've started on nicotine replacement therapy and have given myself a nicotine stop date of Christmas Day. 

The last few months of my nicotine use have been exclusively vaping nicotine salts. Although I'm still ingesting a shit-ton of nicotine from lozenges and gum, I'm having a really fucking hard time. 

I have a few questions for you all. For one, why is this so difficult despite my continued ingestion of nicotine? I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. I'm irritable (to the point of becoming furious). I have an extremely difficult time concentrating. Just all around discomfort. 

Second question is what's the expected timeline here? I.E. when did the withdrawal symptoms begin to go away for you all?

I'm excited to be a part of this community. Hopefully I can keep it up.

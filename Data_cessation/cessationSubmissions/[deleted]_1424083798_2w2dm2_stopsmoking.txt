I hopped on, hopped off - now I feel finally free. I (AND my brain) know we will never smoke a cigarette anymore. But why do I get NOW cravings?

Not only a craving - a weird one too. It's kind of a short 1-2 minute long nostalgic craving... every two hours or so. 

I don't get it because I really don't feel nostalgic at all. I am so gald I am free, I can drink alcohol and I won't want a cigarette (unlike the times before, when I was quitting). And I know I will stay free. I hadn't had real physical and psychological withdrawals
in the first days. I ended it - it feels for me like it was years ago, when I was still a smoker. I don't want these irrational cravings.

Looking for every tip in the book

I’m smoking 25 cigarettes a day and can’t seem to stop. This escalated in the past year due to a mental disorder (schizophrenia) it helps with symptoms. 

But that being said I know how detrimental it can be to your health. Tried the patch, didn’t work. Tried vaping, the coil always tasted nasty at some point eventually even though i changed and cleaned and lubricated them. 

What’s your method?

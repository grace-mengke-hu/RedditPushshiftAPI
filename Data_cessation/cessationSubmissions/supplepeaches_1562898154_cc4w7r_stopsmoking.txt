Mistake

I relapsed pretty hard this last week and have been feeling pretty down on myself. It's my own fault. Got really drunk and hung out with someone who I hadn't seen in a while and he had no idea I had quit and started ripping through cigarettes and kept offering em to me til I caved. I fell to peer pressure. So my counter restarts today after about 3 months without a smoke or dip.

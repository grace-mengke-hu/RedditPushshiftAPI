Bouncing Back after Relapse Suggestions?

It was my third time quitting from a pack-a-day. It was my longest streak by far (37 Days), by day 51 I was back at half a pack a day. It's time to re-set my badge and get back to it.

What are your tips for bouncing back after a major relapse? I've read Alan Carr's book, which was my main motivation for the quit, and I feel like I don't have as much motivation as the last try. 
Do you have any suggestions?

Wanting to quit. Tips? Help?

Hi! I started smoking three years ago to help relieve anxiety and stress. I have a horrible anxiety disorder and grab a cigarette every single time I get anxious.. Which is very often. Anyway, I turn 23 on the 25th of this month and I just want to quit. I already have enough health problems to continue doing this to myself.

I can't afford special gum or anything.. So my question is: Do you guys have any simple tips or tricks that might help me stay away when I get a craving? I just smokes 20 minutes ago and I already really want one. Especially since I just decided I want to stop. It's making me super anxious and I just don't know if I can do this. 

Also. What should I expect physically? All input is appreciated.

Day 4, feeling odd.

Any other day 4 people feel... like totally "cured?" I still feel like I want to smoke, honestly, but not like I need to. I feel like I was mad at cigarettes like one might be mad at an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, but now I'm like... apathetic. It hasn't even been that long, and my cravings earlier/for the last four days have been really intense. Suddenly they are just gone. It makes me suspicious, haha.

I've done good.

Okay, so the last month I realised that I was about to reach the holy year, tbh when I started out, I never thought I could do this. But damn I was so tired of smoking at that point. I went cold turkey, and hey lookey I've been without cigarettes for a year now. 
After the first month, I only had to focus when I had triggers, and the more triggers I "survived", the better it got. Now I really seldom have any triggers, and I'm trying to motivate other friends to stop as well. Feel free to ask me about it.

The dangers of nicorette, I can't BELIEVE I've been recommending this stuff to everyone...?

I stumbled upon this after wanting to research nicorette making my throat horrendously dry. I've been chewing it for 26 days now (off and on before that) but only recently noticed that my heart has been palpitating erratically for the last 3 days. I am going to try to "quit" nicorette very soon. I know this doesn't show a clinical study, but it's scaring me reading how long some of these people have been chewing the gum. 9 years?!?!?! That stuff is NOT cheap!

Another thing that scared me is a lot of the people report thinning hair. I don't want my hair to fall out...

Thoughts, my dear redditors...?

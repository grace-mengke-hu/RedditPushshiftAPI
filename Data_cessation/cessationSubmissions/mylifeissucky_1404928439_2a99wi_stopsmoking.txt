I am sure I was 1Million Percent ready if day 5 and still NO SMOKING

Not even once at all. I see that the temptation is much lower as well. I never really even had a craving this morning like I did the other days. I wonder if the nicotine has cleared now? 

 I had to be a billion percent ready that I was about to break down and cry at first when I decided to just stop smoking.

Day Five and I am still Quit and will be going back to Superboss Level, Trial By Fire level and replaying it. I know what the boss does, so I know how to beat Nicodemon boss.

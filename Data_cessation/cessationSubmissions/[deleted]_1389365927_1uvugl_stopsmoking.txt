At 9:57 AM EST, January 10th, 2014, I smoked my last cigarette.

Before I finish typing this sentence, I have taken my last drag of a cigarette. No real reason for me to post this other than documentation. 

To all the others going through what I'm going through, keep your head high! There are reasons you want to quit. Remember that those reasons are far more important than a cigarette. I have to remember that too!

Little trick that has been helping me these past two days

So I'm mostly a weekend/bar smoker. Sometimes I'd smoke an entire pack at the bar and wake up with a sore throat and smell like shit. I've been off and on trying to quit, used an e-cig for awhile but it just wasn't the same and I want to kick the nicotine all together.

I'm sitting at the golf course I work at and this old, obese guy pulls up in his car. He's one of the regulars. Every time I see him he has a cigarette in his mouth. I go to get his golf bag and he smiles at me. This image is ingrained in my head for some reason. His faces his heavily wrinkled, likely from years and years of smoking. But the thing that sticks with me is the deposits of brown, yellow shit in between each of his teeth. 

Every time I get a craving I think of this guy's teeth and it suddenly eases up. Also been using gum (which works okay I guess and gives me fresh breath), but heavily using sunflower seeds. Seriously, stop by the gas station next time you're riding around and get some sunflower seeds. They do wonders.

Keep at it guys, and say fuck you to that voice in your head.

7 days smoke free! Can’t sleep and very lethargic.

Hi guys, I made it 7 days without a cigarette. I am trying my hardest to exercise a little every day and keep busy if I have a craving by getting up and doing something. The problem is I wake up around 3 am every morning and can’t fall back asleep for about an hour or so. I’m also finding I have no energy. I get home from work around 4:30 pm and the only thing I want to do is go to sleep. Is this normal for anyone else?

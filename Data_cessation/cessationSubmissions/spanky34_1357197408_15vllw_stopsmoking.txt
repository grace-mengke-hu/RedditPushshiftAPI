One Month Down - A Lifetime To Go

I know we've got a bunch of people in here for the New Year's Resolutions and I just wanted to let everyone know what they have to look forward to in 31 short days.  I've saved over $150 dollars in that time and saved over a day and a half of time that I would have spent smoking.  That's right, I spent on average, an entire day and a half smoking over the course of the month.  That was a huge eye-opener.  The dreams have subsided and I've only had one in the last 2 weeks.  The cravings are gone.  I hate the smell of cigarettes, food tastes awesome, I have magnificent boners, and life is just overall better without them.  

You can break this addiction and free yourself from it.  We got this!  Here's to my first cigarette free year in 6 years!

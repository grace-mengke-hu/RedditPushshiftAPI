Bout to try quitting again. With an old lifehack to help.

A few years back I was able to quit for three months or so. I remember how great I felt, yet somehow slipped back into the habit. The first month, I had a trick that helped it go by. First, think of someone you dislike (the more the better). Write their name on an envelope, and quit. If you smoke (and you have to be honest with yourself, smoke... then put a dollar in the envelope. At the end of the month, give that envelope to the person. Some people argue and say give to a charity, but that won't work as well. You'd feel a justification of smoking. If you dislike someone, you'll be more inclined NOT to smoke. It worked once for me, here I go again.

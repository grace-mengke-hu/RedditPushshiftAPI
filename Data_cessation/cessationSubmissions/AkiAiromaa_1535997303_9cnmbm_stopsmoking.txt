My study at /r/stopsmoking: I’v been going trough posts, refreshing them as fast as I can for a long time. Seems there is an army of people or bots down voting posts on this subreddit. Who are they? Bitter people who can’t quit? The tobacco mafias minions? I dunno, but they are real. See 4 ur self!

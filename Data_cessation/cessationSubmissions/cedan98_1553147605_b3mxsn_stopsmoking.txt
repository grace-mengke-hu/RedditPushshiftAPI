How to actually quit

Hello, 
I’m really struggling to quit smoking. I do know how bad and useless smoking is but somehow I can’t stop. A lot of my friends smoke and i feel like i would lose a lot of social interaction by quitting..I tried to switch to vaping but it’s not the same for me. Do you guys have any helpful advice for me? I don’t want to harm my body anymore.

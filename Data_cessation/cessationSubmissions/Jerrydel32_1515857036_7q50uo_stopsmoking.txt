4 days, 8 hrs and I took three hits

I was going strong, I had my wisdom teeth removed and it gave me the reason to not smoke. As soon as I was aggravated I went straight outside. I took three hits and was disgusted and ashamed so I put it out. Now I have to reset my timer because I can’t can’t control myself.

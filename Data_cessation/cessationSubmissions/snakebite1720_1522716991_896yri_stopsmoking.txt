So this is my third attempt in last 20 days and am afraid

Guys,

So here's the thing, in last 20 days this is my third attempt and am almost into day 3. I know how it's gonna feel for the rest of the day today as I have experienced it before. Earlier attempts I was happily smoke free for a week both times and then had them out of the blue but I learnt. 

Point is am afraid by thought of what if I started again or had one at a party or a trip or anything. The thought of this is making me vulnerable. I really wanna be clean for my wife. She hates smoking. But this thought is killing me. 

Suggestions? Sorry for the long post ..

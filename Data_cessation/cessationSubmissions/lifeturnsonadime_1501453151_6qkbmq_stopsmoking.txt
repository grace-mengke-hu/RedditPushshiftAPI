Health anxiety about former smoking

I quit what averages out to a ten-year smoking habit (at least a pack a day to start with... by the end just two or three cigs when drinking) two years ago. Recently I've slipped up a couple times when having a beer and had a cigarette.

I'm currently in the grip of a health anxiety spiral and I'm terrified about the damage I've done to myself by these years of smoking. 

Anyone else? I need to feel less alone :(

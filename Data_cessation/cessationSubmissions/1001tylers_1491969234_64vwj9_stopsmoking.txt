24 hours...

I just made it past the 24 hour mark. Finally. It's been a while since I made it this long. I feel terrible. I forgot about how crappy my life is. Now I remember and it sucks even worse lol.

It's like everything bad that's happened in the last few years just all happened yesterday.

I hate this. I know it will level out but like ugh

And I just ate and I feel so bloated that it hurts. I can't stop eating.

Yay fun times.

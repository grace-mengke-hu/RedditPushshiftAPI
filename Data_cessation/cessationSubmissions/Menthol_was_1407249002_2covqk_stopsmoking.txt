It's been 15 days and it hasn't been cake!

It's been 15 days and just like the title says it hasn't been easy! I can't believe some people on here say they haven't had any cravings. That boggles my mind. Maybe they weren't truly addicted? I get at least 3 to 4  cravings a day. It's when I tend to do daily tasks that used to involve cigarettes going hand in hand that I crave them the most. I.e. driving, drinking, being at work with smokers. The typical! But I do have the support of my coworkers! They don't coax me which I really appreciate. I fight the urge, which usually goes down from a level 9 to a mild 2 or 1 after about 5 to 10 mins. Then my mind gets distracted with something else and I forget about it! 

Keeping myself busy works for me! Clean clean clean and working out ( I really want to lose 30lbs in 4 months) helps me!
This is the perfect time to start thinking healthy in all factors of your life! If you want to lose weight or just get healthier with your eating habits. Now is the time to do it. It keeps you on track and distracted from thinking about smoking! The cravings will still happen though... but you can do it! 

I'm going to keep trucking.
Keep logging in my diary entries with the smokefree app. 
Keep on keeping on because I do feel a lot better!
 I can breathe better. I can run forever now!!! And I don't smell like clingy foul cigarette smoke! My skins behaving better too! I must of touched my face a lot with smokey fingers. Gross!
I'm going to keep on keeping on!
I can't wait until I can say a year!!! :) 
And I love reading everyone's posts and seeing when they say it's been a year or however long! It's inspiring! Thank you. 

Good luck to you all!

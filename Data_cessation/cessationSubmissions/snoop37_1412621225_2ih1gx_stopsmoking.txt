Tiredness from nicotine withdrawls

Short narrative: I quit smoking about 45 days ago. I've been using a "vape" with nicotine to ween myself off. Every time I go COMPLETELY off the nicotine though I get incredibly tired and can't function. This doesn't work for my lifestyle so I pick the vape back up.

Has anyone experienced this, and if so how long did it take to get through this stage of tiredness? I need to plan a few days or however long it's going to be where I have nothing to do and can just be a tired vegetable.

Any advice with this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

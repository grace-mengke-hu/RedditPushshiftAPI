420 too...

Well today is my first day of quitting tobacco (again), and honestly it isn't so much the cigs that I'll miss, I'm realizing it's the spliff.
I love rolling a spliff at the end of the day to decompress, but I had to be honest with myself. Weed and tobacco are so closely linked now (like coffee and tobacco). I always crave one with the other, and I had to make a decision to give up both in this process which I never saw coming. 
The other half of it is now half my entire social circle are stoners (also didn't see that coming), so I am also feeling like I need to retreat back until I have a better handle on my health.
Maybe one day I could, but for now I have to
commit to giving up all of all smoke I would put in my lungs, and take control until I have more control.
Anyone else dealt with this?

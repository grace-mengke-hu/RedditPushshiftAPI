12 Days in because of a cute girl. These are the benefits/cons so far!

So I've tried to quit smoking for my own good quite a lot of times. Who would've figured a cute girl would be the one to make me stick with it?

Short story: Got broken up with last year, was devastated, smoked like crazy to dampen anxiety, got myself together but the smoking like crazy part stuck, decided to start studying again, met cute girl in my class, no idea if she likes me or not, she says smoking is bad, i quit one week later - Cold turkey. 

Now it's been 12 Days, and she's cheering me on every time we see eachother in school, which feels great.

Pros - 
* I can lift so much more, so much longer at the gym.

* I'm no longer disgusting to some people on the datin scene.

* I have so much time (wtf do I do with it?).

* When I get tempted to smoke I do a Choir instead (first week, my apartment was spotless).

* I'm motivating my friends to quit smoking simply by quitting myself.

* My skin is clearer, more alive?

* I sleep better, and I'm almost not coughing anymore.

* I don't have to spit up those disgustingly large snots by clearing my throat every morning.

* So. Much. Money.


Cons - 


* Waiting for the tram, after the gym, after eating, I feel restless because I'm used to doing something here (consuming something works great, like gum, an energy bar, a coke or whatever).

That's it. There are no more cons. You get restless from time to time, and it's easy to fix. 

If you can't do it for yourself, do it for someone else. 

You've got this!

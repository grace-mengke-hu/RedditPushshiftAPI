Badge reset...

I went for a 9 km jog this morning, and felt so good I didn't take any nicotine gum in several hours.And then on late lunch with my parents I had a glass of wine... When I got back home I was craving a cigarette like crazy, and my neighbor was having a smoke and I just couldn't resist asking for one. 

But tomorrow's a new day. This was just one mistake, but I *will* quit, damn it.

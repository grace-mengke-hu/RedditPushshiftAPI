An ultra-rare 4 week badge has appeared! NSV

One of my favorite things about these badges is the 4 week badge only lasts a few days, so you get two achievements quicklyâ€”4 weeks and 1 month in a row.

My non-smoking victory to report is I just spent the entire weekend in Nashville at a Bachelor / Bachelorette party, complete with life-time smokers, carton buyers, and vapers. Didn't smoke and probably only had one craving when I was pretty drunk, but even then I knew I didn't truly want it and it would ruin my night and progress. Still coughing up crap but I'm excited to breathe another day. 

As they say in Nashville, I appreciate you. Keep going y'all!!!

How to get out of the drunk smoking cycle?

Alright, guys hope we're all well.

I never got into smoking fully I mainly did it 'socially' and before you rip into me saying that's just an excuse I would literally only do it with friends and I stopped before it became a habit or came to anything thank God.

One problem I do have is whenever I get drunk I instantly start looking for a fag, it's almost as if it's instinctive for me now to go for a cig as soon as I get drunk. If anyone has any advice on how I can get out of this cycle it would be much appreciated :)

Thanks in advance

Day 4 no smoking

I'm really trying to keep this up. If I can stay smoke free for good I'll be really proud of myself. Good luck to everyone else here who has made the decision to stop smoking! 

Edit: If anyone else comes across this post I'd just like to say thanks. This is by far the nicest group of people I have ever come across on reddit. Thankyou for all the kind words and support, you really know how to make a girl feel motivated!

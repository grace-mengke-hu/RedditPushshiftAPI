Want to quit bonging my smokes

Ever since I tried mixing my bowl with some tobacco and weed I quit smoking cigarettes, but started bonging my tobacco hourly, the kick used to be amazing, now I only feel my morning smoke, but routinely hit a bowl every hour or so
I can't break the habit no matter what, I won't smoke outside of my home tho, even if offered a cig

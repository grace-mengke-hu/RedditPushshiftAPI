Two months and arghhhhhhh

2 months 8 days. 

I’ve wanted to smoke what feels like all day every day for the past two weeks. I’m a drug addict and I have bipolar disorder. I take meds, see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, and have been sober and stable for 9 years. I haven’t lived a day since I was 14 without drugs or cigarettes. I have an anxiety disorder that makes it difficult for me to leave my house and be around people. It hasn’t improved since I stopped smoking. 

I don’t want to die of smoking related illness. Ultimately though I just don’t want to suffer. I cried a few mornings ago because I wanted to smoke so badly. I’ve been in agony this week thinking to myself god I just want to smoke again. It’s challenging to go a night without having a drink. I can feel a pull there where I didn’t before.

I really, really don’t want to smoke at the same time. I love being free of the ball and chain. I love being able to be inside and have my brain work long stretches of time. But I’m scared. I feel like I’m not made for this, and that maybe what cigarettes do to my brain is worth the cost of what they do to my body.

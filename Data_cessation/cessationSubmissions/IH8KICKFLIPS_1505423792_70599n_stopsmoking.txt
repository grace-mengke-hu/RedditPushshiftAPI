Anyone else struggling with hypochondria, panic attacks, anxiety, and depression around the 3-4 week mark?

I have had, surprisingly, very few physical withdrawals or cravings since I quit. My main enemy so far seems to be hypochondria and panic attacks. 

I had some very odd (but not scary really) things going on in my throat and eustatien tube that sparked me to quit for good. They are still on going although they seem to be minor and I'm scheduled to see a doctor in a few days.

However I've been having some panic attacks and anxiety that I think could be hypochondria revolving around these feelings. I know anxiety and panic attacks are not uncommon after quitting smoking. I've always had mild anxiety and panic attacks here and there but it's never been like this. On a scale of 1-10 I'd say I floated between 1-3. Now since quitting I'm at a 6-8. 

What did you guys experience? Any hypochondria or panic attacks?

I'm 25 and male. Smoked a pack a day for 8 months followed by a year of vaping. Quit 3 weeks ago

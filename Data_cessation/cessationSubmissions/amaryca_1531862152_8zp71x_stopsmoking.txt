Day 30

Made it to the 30 day mark -- this is not my first time quitting but I hope to make it my last. Using the patch and Smoke Free app, just bumped down from the 21mg to the 14mg. Been pretty cranky since I moved to the smaller patch, but I haven't had terrible urges to smoke just general crankiness. I failed in previous quits because I felt safe, like I could have just one cigarette and not be addicted again. But I have definitely proven that I cannot have just one cigarette. Looking forward to tomorrow, one day closer to being totally nicotine free.

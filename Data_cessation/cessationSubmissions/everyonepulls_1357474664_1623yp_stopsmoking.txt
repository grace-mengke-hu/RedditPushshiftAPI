With patches on I´m doing OK BUT after a few nights with livid weird dreams...more inside.

I have stopped 2 or 3 times with 24 hours patches on and it went OK, the craving stopped and I felt great - BUT after 2 or 3 nights of livid weird dreams I take it off and try cold turkey because I really can´t deal with the weird dreams. Next my cravings get stronger and the second someone annoys or stresses me I´m back to smoking. I hate what cigarettes do to my lungs, my breathing, my smell and so much more. I don´t have the willpower to stop cold turkey because right now a lot of shit is going on in my life but I really want to be a nonsmoker. I´m thinking about nicotine bubblegums, but at the same time I´m afraid of getting the dreams again. Is there anyone who had normal dreams while stopping smoking?

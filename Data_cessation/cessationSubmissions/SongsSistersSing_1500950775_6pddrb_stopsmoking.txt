Finally on Day 2!

As someone who has tried to quit smoking many times, the first day always comes off a surprise.   Today was no different.  

Luckily, I didn't have intense cravings or anything (although, I know they are there on the periphery, waiting to strike) but I have had the worst anxiety.   I'm talking chest pain, my feet going numb, hand numbness, feeling like I can't breathe,  obsessive thoughts about my lungs being destroyed, my impending death... I mean, it got so bad that I almost got hit by a car while walking cause I wasn't paying attention and was lost in mind.  

How do I know it's not something graver? Well, I ran three miles today 5 minutes faster than I ran 3 miles last week and during/afterwards I had no gasping for air or intense chest tightness.  Thus, my only thought is: anxiety manifesting as respiratory distress.   It makes sense since I have been very stressed out this summer as I am starting a pretty intense grad school program.  Unfortunately for my stress, but fortunately for my body (and wallet), I am determined to never smoke in grad school.   

Apart from the anxiety, day wasn't too bad.  Didn't binge eat a bunch (minus the two pound bag of tater tots for lunch), drank a ton of hot tea so I could feel that familiar throat burn, ate my veggies and fruits, and really drew out my day's activities to take as long as possible (i.e. almost an hour long hot shower this morning).  

I feel like my rambling makes it sound like the struggle of Day 1 was trite and effortless, but it was definitely hard.  Stepping into a grocery store while tearing up for no apparent reason is both distressing and depressing.  Convincing yourself you have every smoking related disease under the sun is annoying and energy sapping.   It was a rough day but I got through it!

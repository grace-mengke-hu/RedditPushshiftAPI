The thing that helped me to quit

Just want to share this with you. I made a promise to myself (out loud) that I would not touch another cigarette. Ever.
It was very hard to speak these words to myself, because I keep my promises and I knew I couldn't go back on it. 
My boyfriend smokes in our appartment. And I am going through a lot of shit atm with my job and personal life.  But still, Even on the toughest moments i kept my promise.
7 weeks now. Im so fucking happy about it and so proud.
I know you can do it too!

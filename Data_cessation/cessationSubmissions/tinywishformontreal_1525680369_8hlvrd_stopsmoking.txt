Smoked one and regretted it later - it wasn't worth it as it first seemed

Sometimes it feels like I just miss the ritual and the smoke itself. I don't miss the shitty taste after and the plummet in energy that follows. 


 Its been a few days since stopping after heavy use and honestly I've already been feeling better. I don't know what I did this for besides re-confirming that this has nothing to add to life besides a fa√ßade of taking a break that one can do without the shitty consequences, amirite

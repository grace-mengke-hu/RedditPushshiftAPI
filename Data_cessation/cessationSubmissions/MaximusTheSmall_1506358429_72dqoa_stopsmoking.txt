How to break the habit?

Hey everybody,

I've finally decided to quit the addiction after a lot of friends stopped smoking. What I usually find myself doing is linking cigarettes to activities or different part of the day. Example; Walking to the bus in the morning (or basically anywhere. After dinner, before going to sleep etc. etc.)

I notice I usually smoke when I'm bored and if I keep myself busy I don't really have to urge to smoke.

Do you guys have any tips for me?

Thanks!!

Help with cravings

I have smoked for over 10 years, I stopped smoking 6 days ago.. I classed myself as a casual smoker only when I drink, but deep down i have at least 5 cigarettes a day, increasing to at least 10 if I drank, which was fairly often if I’m honest. I am having a drink and I feel there is something missing... I am controlling the cravings, knowing I won’t have a cigarette, but I feel I can’t unwind and relax. Also I really miss a cigarette before bed.. just curious if anyone else felt the same and if they felt better over time? Feeling very frustrated at the moment

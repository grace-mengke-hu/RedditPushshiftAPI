Anyone else used the American Lung Association program?

I have been trying to quit for a while and my wife found this site (http://ffsonline.org/) that walks you through a series of modules to help you retrain yourself. I've read Carr, used NRT and Chantix, and tried basically every other method I could find. My quit date is next week and I have to say this is the first time I've ever really felt like I could do it.

Just wanted to throw it out there for anyone looking for help. The tasks they give you seem silly and tedious but I've definitely noticed my thinking change as I use them. I really like the idea of using the modules as a way to stay focused on the goal.

I'll report back next week when I'm free from nicotine!

Advice? Not a long time smoker but kind of think im addicted now

I have smoked 4 packs of cigarettes in my life. After i quit smoking weed(huge problem for me) i started using an e cig. Used that on and off, then regularly a few weeks ago until it broke. i then bought a pack of cigs and chain smoked half of it and threw it out telling myself id never smoke again. 

Then i bought another pack the next morning and yeah, you get the gist. I do not want this shit to be a full on problem but its hard to stop just now. Its gross, and girls think its gross too, and i cant be doing this shit anymore. Yet i still really want nicotine... its just like weed was for me. When i smoke i want to quit but when i quit i want to smoke. 

Advice? Please dont mock me for not having a long serious problem haha

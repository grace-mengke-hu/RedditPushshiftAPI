Drinking and quitting = fail

I feel like crap. Made it to Day 6 with no problem and then i decided to have a few drinks and lost all self control... I've smoked like half a pack already. I was feeling so good about myself before i went full retard. 

Im amazed how powerful the addiction really is. Before drinking i didnt even think about smoking. Really depressing. Well i guess its lesson learned... Off to a New start.

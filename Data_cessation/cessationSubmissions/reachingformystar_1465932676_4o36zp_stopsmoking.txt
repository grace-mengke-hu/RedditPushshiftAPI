Ran my first marathon 2 weeks ago

I quit smoking less than a year ago after a pack a day smoking for 25 years. It seriously took me 8 years of actively trying to quit before this last quit that stuck. Cold turkey. Started running on and off after quitting. Could not run 50 yards in the beginning without doubling over.

On May 28th I finished the full marathon (Bayshore) in little over 6 hours.

This was my first race ever for any distance. I have never run before, not even a 5K, as I started smoking pretty early in life. I did not consider myself as athletic but people now tell me I am. I guess I just did not know due to all that smoking. 

Just wanted to say to folks who are early in their smoke free journey: Keep on keeping on, not only it gets better, you will be amazed at the things you will be able to do that you could not even imagine before.

This sub has been a huge help with support and inspiration. Thank you.

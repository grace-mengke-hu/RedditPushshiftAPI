Finally got sick of it, this badge is for realsies

I'd say it took me about 4 years from the time I started trying to quit to actually quitting (~1000 days ago). Hard to say what finally did it but these things contributed:

- **Constantly thinking about how much I hate smoking** and how much I want to stop. Just keeping it on the surface of my mind instead of pushing it away.

- **Seeing a friend talk about how happy he was** to be quit and how much he was enjoying not smoking.

- **Trying all sorts of quit methods.** I ultimately quit cold turkey and it's definitely the method I recommend, but I can't rule out the impact that other quit methods had on me in the meantime. I did the patch off and on for many months, which broke up my smoking habit. I tried nicotine gum, which only served to irritate me. I tried Chantix, which gave me a yeast infection and frustrated the hell out of me. All these efforts and frustrations pushed me further towards finally quitting.

- **Researching my issue.** Just educating myself about smoking and the benefits of quitting made me want to quit more.

- **Realizing how much simpler my life could be** if I just didn't have to think about it all the time and always be trying to get my fix.

- **Noticing that I didn't enjoy smoking anymore**. I hated picking up a cigarette every time. I didn't like the feeling anymore. It made me feel gross.

I'm so happy to be smokeless! I don't even miss it. I can't believe I'm finally free.

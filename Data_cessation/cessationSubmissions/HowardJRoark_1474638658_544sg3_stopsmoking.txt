I used Marijuana to quit cigarettes and it worked.

Prior to this attempt I've tried to quit no less than 100 times. At least 50 of those attempts have lasted longer than 24 hours. 

One week of **heavy**, deliberate and mindful use of the plant has lead to me being quit for over three years now   ..   Worth mentioning,  I thought. 

edit: Also worth mentioning is that I dont currently use MJ and think regular use more often than not leads to a very insidious addiction.  The plant is very easy to abuse and in my opinion should only be used sparingly, and with good reason :)

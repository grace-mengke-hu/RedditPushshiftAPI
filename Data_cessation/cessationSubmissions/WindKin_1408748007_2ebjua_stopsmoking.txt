2 years of progress reset this week. Right, let's redo this the right way.

Two years ago, or close to it, my then girlfriend and I officially stopped. 
We went over to something called "snus" here in Scandinavia, because hey, at least we weren't sucking shit into our lungs amirite? 

The first couple of months was a struggle, despite still getting nicotine into the system, and I sort of slipped up here and there when drinking sometimes, but overall, progress was good. 

Fast forward a couple of years. Most of my then triggers had been conquered, and while I was still an addict, at least I could walk to the shops without getting winded. 

This week though, I changed jobs. I was put into a couple of situations I hadn't been in since I quit, and it caught me *completely* off-guard. The actual train of thought that went down is sort of embarrassing to me now that I'm out of the situation, so I won't relay it. 

So yeah. Day 1. Again. This time I'm doing it without the replacement because fuck the pope.

Could use some encouragement, brothers.

18 days in, haven't touched a cigarette since going cold turkey but I can feel my motivation slipping now and then. Not physical cravings, but still that same lie of "c'mon, it can't be that bad to have just one, you're doing so well after all."

I know it's bullshit and I lack the ability to have just one. All or nothing and I choose nothing. Lately though it's been harder to recall that strong motivation to quit and persevere. If I could ask one favor, just remind me why I'm quitting.

Back to day one!

I made it eight months without cigarettes. Unfortunately, about a month ago I began secretly smoking. I think It started when I got drunk and my friend convinced me to go to the hooka bar. It went all down hill from there. The next week I found myself wanting to smoke a single cig. I made a stupid impulsive decision, and went to the store and got myself a pack. It felt naughty but I enjoyed it. The next couple of weeks I could already tell I had less energy, and became more irritable when I went a long time without them (which was all the time because It was a secret). Last week, my sister smelled it on me, and gave me a hard time about it. It really lowered my self esteem...I knew I had to tell my friends about it eventually. So i finally did last night. One of them quit smoking shortly after I did the first time. So he really encouraged me to quit again. I just extinguished my last cigarette, and I'm feeling confident and proud of myself for hopping right back on my feet! So cheers to being a healthy, wealthy, good ol' non smoker again! 

Moral of the story: Don't fool yourself. There is no such thing as "one time."

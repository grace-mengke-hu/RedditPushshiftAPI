Experience after one month.

Hi all,

For some background.

This is about my third time quitting. The longest prior was close to three months but I started up again after a stressful period. I had cut down to about one pouch of tobacco a fortnight and only when I was drinking. That was my biggest gripe, even if I only had a single beer i needed to smoke. The problem is the majority of my friends all chain smoke when drinking so that can be a challenge.

What has worked for me has been staying away from booze and those guys for the first few weeks and having less temptation, I think that started to build up my resolve. I also bought an inhaler, which is actually sick. If you drag enough of it it feels pretty close to a smoke and sits well in the fingers. I also have been using the app smoke free beta, which sets little challenges and has a good display of time/ money saved. Previously I had used gum and mints but didn't enjoy them. Full disclosure I got a bit too party and smoked two, but was super upset with myself and I think that helped keep me on the straight.

I know many people on here have a tougher challenge (pack a days, more physical dependency) but I just want to wish everyone luck. The best thing is breathing clear and the noticeable energy boost, breathing in a massive gulp and filling your lungs without feeling weird is great. Also my teeth are whiter ( could be new toothpaste tbh).

Thanks and good luck.

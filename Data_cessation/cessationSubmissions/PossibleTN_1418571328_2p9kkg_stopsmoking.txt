Help me get past the first few days....

For the past two weeks I've made serious attempts at quitting, reading the book, watching the movie, educating myself, etc... 

However, Day 3 breaks me every time.  I find a way to justify smoking and buying a pack just leads to finishing the pack.  How can I get over the hurdle of Day 3?

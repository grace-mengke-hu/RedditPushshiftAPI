Try this new technique with me: The Smoke Alarm

Hello all! 2 year smoker here with a method that has been helping me cut back these past few days with very evident improvement.

I call it the **Smoke Alarm**. 
1. Every time you want a cigarette. Set a timer for 5 minutes.*
2. At the end of 5 minutes have a smoke.
3. Next time you want a cigarette. Add one minute to your timer.

Notes:
- Self control is like an elastic. If you stretch it too much it will snap, and you will have to wait for your self control to recover the next day.
- Check out ["Scientific Secrets to Self Control"](http://amzn.com/B00DTO4GP4), it's a short series of lectures with self-control studies and nformation.

*You can do this for every smoke the first day.

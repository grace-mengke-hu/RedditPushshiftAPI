Seeking help for bad nicorette addiction

Hey everyone. I’m coming up on my six year anniversary of ditching the cigs. I’m in my mid-30s and have been addicted to nicotine since I was 15. I starter as a smoker, dipped, smoked, cycle. 

I finally gave it all up when e-cigs came out. That combined w nicorette and lozenges helped me through it. I was on a schedule and tapered gradually. My life kind of went sideways but I never went back to cigarettes or dipping. I started depending more and more on nicorette. I chew the 4mg kind. Fruit chill. About 10 pieces a day. I’m chewing it nonstop. 

I think I’m like the most heavily addicted nicotine person ever. And it’s a huge drain on my wallet. I don’t know what to do. I’m more addicted to the gum than I ever was w cigs. It’s been six years that I’ve been chewing it and I’m so over it.

Has anyone else gone through this? If so, any advice? Many thanks in advance to the community here for tips and support. I really want to leave this addiction behind me once and for all.

One week and just riding it out.

I've quit a hundred times before and it doesn't get easier.  This is the final quit to end all quits.  I'm one week in and I feel pretty good about that.  I know I won't smoke but my emotions are amplified.  Depression and anger particularly.  I know I just need to ride it out and I'll be able to deal with emotions better in a couple of weeks, but it's rough.

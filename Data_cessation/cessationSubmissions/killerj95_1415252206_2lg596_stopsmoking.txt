Quit yesterday

In the wake of my significant other needing to quit because of medical issues (other than they are bad for you) her and I are trying to quit together. I havent had a cigarette in over 24 hours, and i bought the gum today. If there's anyone who reads this, what are some tips to help my SO and I?

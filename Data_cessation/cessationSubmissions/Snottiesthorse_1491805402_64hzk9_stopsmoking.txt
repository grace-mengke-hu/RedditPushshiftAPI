Does second hand smoke awaken the addiction again?

I'm really paranoid of second hand smoke because I'm scared of the idea that its putting small amounts of nicotine in my system and will awaken the sleeping addiction, does second hand smoke make anyone crave a cigarette? should we avoid smoke like the plague?

Need help to get through next week

I quit 76 days ago after smoking for a loooooong time. I leave tomorrow to go to the beach for  a week with several women who were childhood friends.  There will be lots of laughing and eating and joking and smoking.  I don’t think I’ll cave to temptation but I’m getting a little nervous about it.  May need to check in here often for encouragement.

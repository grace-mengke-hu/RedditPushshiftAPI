Got a Cold and It Didn't Require a Visit to the Doctor

I've been sick with a sore throat &amp; sinus "thing" for about a week, and realized today I'm feeling better without any antibiotics, just 'Quilling' for a few days.


Last year, I had two visits to the clinic to treat what should have been run-of-the-mill upper respiratory infections. The same type of illness (as I have now) would aggravate my asthma (which has disappeared since I quit), and require antibiotics and steroids.  The docs would all mention how horrible my lungs sounded.  Both times, my family caught the same crud, but no one else required medical treatment.


Another unanticipated, but welcome, benefit of quitting :-)

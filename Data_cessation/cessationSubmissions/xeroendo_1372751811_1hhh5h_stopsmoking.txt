What app to use?

I really like this one [My Quit Buddy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theprojectfactory.quitbuddy&hl=en) but had to redo my phone and now I can't go back to the day that I quit, it only lets you do the current month and I quit in May. I really want something to keep looking at, telling me I'm doing good. Any suggestions?

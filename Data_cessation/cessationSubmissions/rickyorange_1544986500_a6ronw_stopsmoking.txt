You really need to understand the quitting high

Or pink cloud syndrome .
Look it up,it will protect you. 
I see so many day 1-4 post with people high as fuck on quitting ...trust me .I got addicted to relapse and first week withdrawals.
I am like a borderline in manic mode .then I crash after a week or so .its awful .and I relapse .happened a dozen times before I finally got over it a year ago .how ? But looking that shit up and understanding the pattern .

Sorry but if its your first attempts and you get so cocky and arrogant about quitting after 1 or 3 days .its not looking good for you .statistically its prety much 99% chance you gonna relapse at least once .
You should feel happy about quitting .if you feel miserable ,like you are missing something ,you are fucked .
BUT IF YOU FEEL HIGH BE VERY CAREFUL.

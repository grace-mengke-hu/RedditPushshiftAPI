New to quitting, i have some concerns

Hi im a 5 year smoker including 2 years of weed on a daily basis. I decided to quit 4 days ago. I havent smoked weed since and only have a morning bowl of dokha (i never smoked cigarettes and i dont know how this compares). Im concerned because i chose to stop to avoid infrequent chest pains. Now that im basically quitting my 2 biggest addictions my body is kind of lost and the withdrawals are frightening me. I cant eat even if my stomach is growling of hunger, and mild yet freaking scary chest discomfort (i checked my lungs and heart and doctors told me im fine). Im just really scared about the withdrawal symptoms and from what ive read i barely experienced anything. I didnt think quitting would have such side effects. Can anyone help me feel better, or at least safer ?

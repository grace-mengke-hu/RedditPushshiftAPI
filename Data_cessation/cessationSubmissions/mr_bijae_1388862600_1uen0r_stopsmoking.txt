Just a little note of encouragement for the NYE quitters

You've made it three full days and most of the fourth. The hardest days are past. Yeah, there are still strong urges at this point, but your body is already getting used to life without all those chemicals! Take a deep breath, you're already breathing in more oxygen. Pretty soon the edginess will fade and you'll stop obsessing over those nasty cancer sticks. Hang tough, you're through the toughest part of the war, only a few more smaller battles to go!

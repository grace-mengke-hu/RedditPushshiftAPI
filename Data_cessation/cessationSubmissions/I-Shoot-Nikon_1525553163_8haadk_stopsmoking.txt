Last few hours step 2 patch, on to step 3

Not one puff since I began my quit 41 days ago with the aid of the step 2 patch and I stuck the last one to my arm this morning. Still, I often get intense cravings. Tomorrow I begin the step 3 patch for two weeks, and then I am done - forever - cravings or not. Wish me luck!

I'm starting today

I'm recently turned 29 y/o, been smoking for 10 years on and off. I've had enough! No more stank, no more clogged nose and throat, no more wasting money, time and health. Been following this sub for a while, just wanted to tell you guys this for (my) extra motivation. I feel that it's time for change, I'm ready! Are you?

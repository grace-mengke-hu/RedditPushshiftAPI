Day 1 - And I'm actually going to do it!

I am now 17, almost 18. I have no idea how it started. just a few puffs when I was 13. During the past 3 years I've been a mix between half a pack a day, to just 2 cigarettes a day. I know it must be harder for others, but I can't go an afternoon after school with at least 3-4 up to when i have 2 before i go to bed. In the past 3 weeks I've been saying today is the day, BUT NOW I MEAN IT. Lately breathing has been harder and i can often hear really high pitch noises when I breathe in and out at times. I'm sick of it. I'm young and should stop before it gets to hard. So......

TODAY IS THE MOTHERFUCKING DAY, TODAY I STOP (well yesterday since i had my last 1). but today i have no more.

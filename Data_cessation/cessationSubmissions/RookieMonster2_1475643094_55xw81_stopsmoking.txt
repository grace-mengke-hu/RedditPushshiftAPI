Five and a half weeks no nicotine

I'm lazy, lethargic and have zero motivation for any physical activity what so ever.   I eat like it's going out of style.  I can chew a pack of gum in a day.  
Every little problem in my life feels like a maelstrom  getting bigger.   
Someone tell me it's going to be ok.  
My support system is insufficient.  
Going to bed now.  
Maybe I'll wake up to something inspirational.

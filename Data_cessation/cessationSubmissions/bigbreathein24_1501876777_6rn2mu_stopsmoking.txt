Haven't used Reddit in a while... log back in and I'm almost at 800 days here :)

This week I honestly still thought about smoking though! I know this is going to be a life long struggle. Summer is especially hard with many people smoking outside with their beers around me.

Good luck everyone, there is hope out there!!

It's time!

After having lost a very dear friend of 30 years last month to lung cancer I've decided it's time to say goodbye to cigarettes after 20 years, but I really don't know where to start. Has anyone had any luck with that Allen Carr book? It seems to get very good reviews so I was thinking about giving that a shot.

Can lots of sex help?

I picked a bad time to quit smoking but I’m 28, been smoking on and off since I was 18 and I’ve had enough. So, can sex help? Like my emotions are all screwed cause I’m craving one so bad but then I’m angry at nothing and then I go to horny then lonely then I’m like wow, sex could solve this...perhaps

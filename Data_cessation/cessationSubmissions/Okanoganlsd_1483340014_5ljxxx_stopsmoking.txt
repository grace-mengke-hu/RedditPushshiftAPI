Again

Well guys, gonna give it another shot tomorrow. Have a halfie left for before bed and that's it. Procrastination is stupid. "One more pack", every day. Glad I've never wanted to try dope cause I cannot imagine that shit. Wanna set out to be a better person and life a healthier life, and quitting coffin nails is part of both of those. Only twenty so the three years I have smoked can be repaired, would just be better to do it now than ever. So, for all you quitters out there, lets fucking quit! Good luck to you all.

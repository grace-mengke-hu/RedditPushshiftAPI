Day 126 and stranger days.

Things are getting better but not exciting. I'd like to tell you I'm on cloud 9, but I'm not. I also didn't hit any lotteries. And I believe this may be the point of this post. To inform those quitting that it's not going to make life like living a fairy tale. 

Cigarettes are still a very strong part of my life - Hell, I did live with the fuckers for 25+ years. So I am constantly thinking about them at weird random times.  The worst times is in times of stress. Stress is the biggest and baddest of psychological triggers for myself.

Don't think I'm giving up. I'm not. In fact the benefits of not smoking totally outweigh anything I ever did as a smoker. For one I can breath so much better. The concept of fresh air had little meaning to me as a smoker and probably to yourself as well. But after 4 months, I'm starting to realize there really isn't anything better. It's very smooth and refreshing.  and I do think about smoking less and less. Last week I was jogging and for a moment I was asking myself why I even took up the activity. Until that very moment I had not though of cigarettes at all that morning.

Another stranger ( but maybe good?) side effect is that even when a strong trigger hits, the thought of actually inhaling/tasting/smelling/ cigarette smoke is practically vomit inducing to myself lately. 

The final thing I can say is emotions balance out. Remember in the beginning of this post I stated things are not exciting? When things normalize they shouldn't be - unless of course something in your life is happening that is actually exciting like jogging 3 miles straight for the very first time in your life. That was pretty exciting.

I'm not sure if this post will serve as motivation or just info on expectations further down the road. Just know it can be done and with the right mind set anyone can accomplish it. 

TL;DR I'm just a rambling guy.

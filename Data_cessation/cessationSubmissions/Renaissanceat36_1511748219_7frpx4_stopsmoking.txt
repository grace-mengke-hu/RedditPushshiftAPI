I stopped for one week a year ago. That’s the longest I’ve gone and I’ve not tried to quit since.

Positives about the past year: I am sober. I am ten months sober and so proud of myself. It was my biggest hurdle, now comes this. 

I have read Allen Carr’s book twice. The first time I quit for three days, the second time I quit for six days. I am starting to read it tonight for the third time. It must be the last time. I have been smoking for 18 years now, I’m approaching 40, and I love myself too much to keep holding myself back. 

Here we go. Page one. I’ll edit this post when I’ve finished the book!!!

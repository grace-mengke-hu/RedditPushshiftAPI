2 1/2 days in, It's easier than I thought!

Used to smoke about 5 a day. My cravings are not that bad, a few deep breaths and they go away quickly. I havent thought of it as much as I thought I would be. Maybe it will get harder. But right now Im doing great and feeling good! :D I would take any advice you guys have!

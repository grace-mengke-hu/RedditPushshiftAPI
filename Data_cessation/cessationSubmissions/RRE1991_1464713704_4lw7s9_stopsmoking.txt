I want to quit

I've been on and off quitting cigarettes for almost 3 months. I'll go 5 days without one, even a week, and then I'll end up buying a pack. I'll smoke three or four and get fed up, throw the pack away and the cycle will repeat. 

I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) about two years ago and cigarettes were my savoir during this time. I know it sounds bad, but it was the only thing that got me out of bed. I would jump up like yes! I can have a cigarette now. I could drink some coffee and do what I needed to survive for the day. Now I'm doing exponentially better...I've tapered off anti depressants, I've tapered (but still midly suffering from withdrawal symptoms of) benzodiapenes, but I cannot kick this smoking habit.

After the first couple of days when i quit my mood just dips like crazy. I dont know if it's because I have to give up this one thing that helped me during those times, and i miss it, or if it's because the cigarettes are improving my mood, and i no longer have them. after about four days I convince myself I need cigarettes because it elevates my mood, even if it is an addiction. but then I have one and I tell myself I don't need it. rinse and repeat. 

any words of encouragement to help me just say no and to address the issues of this residual depression, to realize i will be overall happier without cigarettes, and tips to stay strong through the waves would be so appreciated. I want to quit, but I never want to go back to where I was two years ago. I guess I'm a little afraid of getting rid of this one constant, albeit one of the most unhealthy constants, I've had through the toughest times. thanks everyone

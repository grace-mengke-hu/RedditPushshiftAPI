Found out my dad has lung cancer today but I don't care.

I'm a little shocked but I don't feel 1% sad or sympathetic. I had an amazing relationship with my father when I was little. He was my hero. Things changed as I got older and I started to detach from him solely because of his smoking and our relationship for the past 15 years has been slowly declining. Him and my step-mom both smoke. They smoked in the house all my life. I hated it more than anything. Nobody wanted to come over to my house, I went to school reeking, I had to breathe in smoke and I hated it so much. I have a young son now and I refuse to ever bring him inside their home and it's strained our relations even more. They've seen him less than ten times and he's almost 3. What made me really go off is when I became a parent. What kind of twisted, selfish, degenerates have such little regard for their own child that they smoke in the fucking house he grows up in....I wouldn't do that to my son for anything. 

After becoming an adult I high-tailed it out of there. I wouldn't fish with my dad because I refuse to be stuck in a boat all day with a chain smoker. I couldn't hunt with my dad, go on road trips, or pretty much do anything where we would be in close quarters. Pretty much all my adult life I've refused to go around him. I've stated multiple times "I would love to see you dad, I would love to do all these things with you. But I'm not going to. The day you decide a relationship with your son and grandson is more important than smoking cigarettes, you call me." He picked cigarettes. And now he has lung cancer. And I don't give a shit.

Anyway, if you're going to quit smoking, if not for yourself, do it for someone else.

Winter Woes Turn to Winter WOAHS!

I am just now realizing how much easier this winter has been for me since I quit. 

1. Don't have to be in the cold for a smoke a few times an hour
2. Money saved = Heating Bill is easier to handle
3. My lungs aren't tight
4. My breathing in the cold wind isn't labored and shallow
5. No disgusting mucus!
6. No hacking up a lung in the morning!
7. I get to stay nice and toasty in my truck instead of rolling the windows down
8. My winter clothes don't give off a putrid stench (cause, ya know--kinda hard to wash a large coat) 
9. Nose isn't stuffed all the time!
10. Haven't been sick all winter when usually a cold hits me once or twice this time of year!

I could go on!

Best decision EVER!

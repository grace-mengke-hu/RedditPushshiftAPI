28 days later... :)

OK, so here's the deal...

I just beat another craving and I wanted to come post to brag about it. I will try to condense some good advice for y'all trying to quit.

* You may have to quit many times, a few unsuccessfully. Here's my history:

            Born to smoker parents.

            Smoked first cig at age 11. Smoked 3 packs and quit.

            Furiously fought parents to quit for years. They did.

            Started in college at age 19 in 2003.

            Quit in 2005 for 2 months with a patch. Returned to smoking.

            Quit in 2007 for 2 months with gum. Returned to smoking.

            Quit in 2008 for 1 week with patch.

            Quit in 2009 for 3 weeks with 1 week patch; 2 weeks cold turkey.

            Quit in 2013 for 4 weeks by cold turkey

* I read about the different methods. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) isn't very effective. Cold turkey more effective, and more effective with a quit plan.

* I read [The Law of Addiction article here](http://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_04_02_law_of_addiction.html): "Administration of a drug to an addict will cause reestablishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance."

* My quit plan was incubated for three years and I quit on a whim one day when I made the choice to no longer buy cigarettes after weeks of convincing myself that personal responsibility was a philosophy I needed to further explore and utilize. 

* I researched the effects of quitting smoking and there were really good articles explaining the health benefits. I also noticed the article in the news a while back saying if you quit by age 30, 40, 50... The health effects are reduced by a greater amount the earlier. On average, smoking cuts 13 years from your life. If you quit by age 30, you get 10 years back and lose 3. I'm 28. I want a decade longer to live. All I have to do is resist a temporary craving every once in a while and make the choice to not smoke.

* The key to success when quitting cold turkey is to never forget the reason that you quit. That's why my 2009 quit attempt failed. I forgot WHY and gave into a craving. I will be faithful in my reasoning now. I quit because I want to live for an extra 10 years and do not want to die by lung cancer/emphysema/etc. I been to Canada and seen their cigarette packs. Their anti-smoking ads were effective on this American. Thank you for your influence, Canada--you burned some gory images into my memory.

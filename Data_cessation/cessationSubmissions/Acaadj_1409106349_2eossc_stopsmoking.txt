Multitude of questions.

Update: I am atttt 1 day and 21 hours! (WOOO, I'm almost at 2 days!)

1. I have been VERY cranky today. Just.. all around... rude to people. I am never like that, and I feel horrible. I want to tell people to be patient with me, but I feel like I'm making an excuse. Is there something you tell yourself to not get this way. (It should also possibly be mentioned that I have diagnosed OCD ... in the area of worrying (obsessively so.) So, I may not even be all that rude, but I feel as though I am.)

2. For that OCD I am on Celexa (Which.. if you guys know anyone who cannot afford the Luvox for OCD.. this is covered by most insurances, and I am doing SO well on it. This was the first doctor who knew the compatibilites between the two.) I feel like I am a bit of a failure because I am sure the Celexa is helping me quit. Anyone feel similar to this? Like.. I shouldn't even talk about my crankiness because people are having to go through this without ANY sort of medication?

3. While I was on one of my craving workouts today (yay, health!) I overheard some man telling a woman that it shouldn't be that hard to quit cigarettes, because it's an oral addiciton.. not anything else.. so just pop a sucker in. Has anyone else encountered this?

4. Something that is really helping me... is visually seeing the money I'm saving. This isn't a question, but maybe a tip? To see 13 dollars in a jar today, was mind blowing. Just hit me that by the end of the week, I have paid for my electric bill.

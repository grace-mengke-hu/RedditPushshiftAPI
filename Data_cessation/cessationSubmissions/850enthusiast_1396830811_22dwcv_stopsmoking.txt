opinions on Chantix?

has anyone had any success using Chantix? I'm starting it in a week, and I am feeling very positive about it and I think it could really help me out. 

Edit #1: Wow guys thanks for all the positive thoughts and posts! I'm glad to hear the answer "it works if you make it work" because that's the kinda things I like to hear. I'm working at Cedar Point this summer and I think it's a perfect chance to quit smoking and start better habits. Plus my Dad is dying some them to and I can't become a smoker like him... :/

Had my first smoking dream

But honestly it was more of a nightmare.

It was super vivid. I was out with friends and they sparked up and hubby handed me his lit cig and I just started puffing away, no hesitation.

And I handed the cig back to him and my brain went *what the hell did you just do?? you were at 17 days!!!* And I started having a mini meltdown about how hard I'd worked to get this far and how I would have to restart my quit date and how I had nicotine back in my body. Like really beating myself up over it. I felt so bad.

Never woke up so glad to be a nonsmoker. 18 days today. Not one more puff, no matter what.

17 day thank you

I'm on day 17 of quitting my 2-5/day habit cold turkey. I feel immensely better mentally and physically. I could not have gotten to this point without the encouragement and support from this sub. I still have some road rage (smoking while driving was my favourite), but overall I am feeling so much better.

I know it's only been 17 days, but I actually can't believe I ever did something as moronic as smoking. Thanks, you guys! Keep on going, my friends!

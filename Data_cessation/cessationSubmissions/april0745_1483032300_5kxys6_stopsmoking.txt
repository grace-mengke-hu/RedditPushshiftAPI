10th attempt to quit ... hope this time is for good ...

I am a smoker since I was 15 (36 now) and trying to quit since I was 29. Had 2 babies since then so I didn't smoke while pregnant or breastfeeding, but as soon as I was able to I started smoking again. But I feel so guilty for smoking, thinking about how I'm going to die because of it and will not see my children growing up... past 2 years I think I quit 5 times. Each attempt lasted 1 to 3 months, but in the end I would just give in... This time I really want it to be for good, don't want to go back to that place ... any advice on how to stay strong this time ?

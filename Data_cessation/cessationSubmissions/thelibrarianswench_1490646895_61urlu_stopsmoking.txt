I reset the addiction :(

I just need to vent. I'm working really hard to not smoke today and I haven't so far.

I quit smoking (from almost a pack a day for six years) last May. Since then I've smoked a small handful of cigarettes - less than six from May of last year up until last week. A few times when I got drunk with friends who smoked, I would bum a cigarette. But I never spent the next day feeling the urge to smoke more or anything and I didn't feel bad about it and months would go in between bumming.

Last week I went to a concert and smoked. And then I just kind of kept on smoking a cigarette every other day or so... and now I've kind of caught up with myself and am refusing to let myself smoke but, damn it, I'm addicted again and I'm going through the whole process of *really needing a cigarette* all over again.

I'm angry with myself and also I really just want a cigarette. I'm finding it difficult to concentrate at work and I can't believe I let this happen. I wasn't completely cigarette-free since last May but I was close enough that I was gonna be pretty happy saying I'd successfully quit for a year come May because it never really felt like those drunken cigarettes counted, because they didn't re-ignite the addiction and I moved on from them without a second thought.

Now it's reignited. It sucks and my head hurts and I want to punch my computer.

GOOD JOB SELF.

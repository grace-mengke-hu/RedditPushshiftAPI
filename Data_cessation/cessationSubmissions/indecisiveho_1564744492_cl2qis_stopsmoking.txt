The biggest test yet.

I smoked for 4 years, quitting this year just before the new year. Last night I learned my grandma, who I’m very close to, has an aneurysm. 

I’ve been able to handle moving twice, relationship problems, not getting paid for months (no sales, no commission), and other family tension. But this. This is hard.

She’s been a very heavy smoker for as long as I can remember, with emphysema that’s destroyed her lungs. Funny thing is she said she’s glad that this is going to take her out and not the emphysema, because it’s so terrible. 

That alone should turn me off but god dammit do I just want to have as many smokes as I can with her before she goes, and to smoke her cigarettes in her memory. I know that’s the exact opposite of what she wants but god do I want it. 

Here’s to staying strong and doing anything BUT buying a pack. We can all do this, we just have to try every day.

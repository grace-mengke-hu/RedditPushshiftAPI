My first day of quitting....for about the 30th time. This time, I'm really determined.

I've quit so many times, I've lost count.  So many excuses lead me back to smoking.  Upon discovering this subreddit and reading all the quality stories, advice and encouragement, I'm more determined then ever.  I'm on nicotine patches (strongest available).

Wish me luck!

One week at 12AM EST! It hasn't been easy but my lungs are appreciative.

Hey guys. First time poster, long time lurker. I am a 5 year smoker (4 on and 1 "quitting") who is envious of all the success i see in this sub. This is my third attempt at quitting and hopefully my last. Cravings were really bad the first couple days. I get horrible spurts of anger when I quit smoking, which is why I still smoke (wife can't handle it when she's pregnant and caves into me). It's horrible. I get so temper tantrumy. I act like my world is collapsing. I felt so sick and weak. I stopped being able to tell what was an actual withdrawal symptom and what was my mind making up.

But here I stand. One week down. Years to go. Tomorrow I'll be going back to my gym (previously had ankle surgery that kept me sidelined from life) which should also help keep my mind off of this.

As I sit here "smoking" a cig sized Twizzler, I wonder to myself, how did I get to this point in my life?

I am 21 hours in. I have never *really* tried to quit before. I had pretended to try just so I could fail rendering quitting impossible.  But, I am about to graduate college May 12. I don't want to enter that chapter of my life a smoker.  I am debating buy Carr's book, but I am scared to get in my car. Irrational I know, but my car was my smokers heaven.

So, here I am. Smoking a Twizzler. This is not fun. :(. I am hoping that I can come back in a few months and talk about how glad I am I did this because right now, I want to cry.

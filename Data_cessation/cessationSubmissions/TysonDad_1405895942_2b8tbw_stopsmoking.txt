Considering quitting, need some help.

Hey Reddit! I've been smoking for a little more than four years. I started at 16, but never regularly until 18. Smoking got me kicked out of my mother's (which, in hindsight, gave me the opportunity to meet my wife, and start a family. So not all things are bad.) And it's time to quit. My son's 2 years old, knows what my cigarettes are, and I don't like him watching me do it. We have never smoked around him. In the house, in the car, nothing. 

It's definitely time to give it up. Today is my last pack of cigarettes. I'm determined to make this work. I went today to a local discount tobacco store and bought an e-cig and some liquid (24mg of nicotine), for roughly 20 bucks.

My plan (as it currently stands) is to smoke on that for 2 weeks, and drop down to a lower amount of nicotine. After 2 weeks, drop down some more, and so on and so forth until I am at 0mg. 

Any of you guys used this plan before? If so, how'd it work for you?

Is there another way you think I should go about it? Please feel free to give some input!

Anything would be appreciated!!!

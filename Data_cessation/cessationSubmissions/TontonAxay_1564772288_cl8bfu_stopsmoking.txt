I couldn’t resist, I broke my 3 days streak

I couldn’t resist for a spliff, with really a bit of tobacco In it. My friend is sleeping in the couch at the moment haha. But I broke my streak. I wish my brain won’t consider the nicotine that much, since I was free for like a day (thank you smoke free app). I didn’t have a pipe on me and my friend cought me by surprise. I think that if it doesn’t make me needy that much I will keep on doing like this: smoking spliff occasionnaly. 

If you guys had experience with this I’m taking it! 


So far I’ve been following the Allen Carr way, and I still consider nicotine as a little monster trying to come back.  Seeing people smoking doesn’t make me wanna smoke. I chew a lot of gum though!

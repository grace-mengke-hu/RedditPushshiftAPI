47 Hours - Cold Turkey

Hi, everyone! I found this subreddit two days ago when I decided to have my last puff. I'm SO glad I found you all! I've been lurking, but reading your posts have helped me so much in my quit.

I haven't smoked analog cigarettes for well over a year, but in that time, e-cigs dominated my life. My nicotine consumption actually went WAY UP (many times over) once switching from analogs to vapor, I went from maybe a pack a week to the equivalent of a pack a day. I've tried the patches, gum, lozenges - anything and everything for smoking cessation, but to no avail. I knew it was time to quit cold turkey. I simply don't want to be ruled by any substance.

At 2pm on 2/8/16 I threw away all of my electronic cigarette stuff and proceeded to "grin and bear it". I'm typing away now because the mental cloudiness, fatigue, and the feeling that "if I just smoke it will all get better" is so overwhelming, i can't imagine ever feeling better. I know that's the devil weed talking...I guess I just need to vent.

Thank you all. I will be around, giving support and gaining strength as needed. We've got this!!

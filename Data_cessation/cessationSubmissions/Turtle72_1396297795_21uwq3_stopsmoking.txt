About 4 days in . . .

Hi All,

I have been trying to quit for awhile.  I don't want my daughter to see me smoke and and am tired of lying to here about why I go outside or why I stink when I come back inside.  Tired os spedning the money and beating myself up for spending it.  It's been 3.5 days and it's been tough, but I am doing it.  It's harder at work to stay focused on the quit as I really do not totally dig my job, but need to quit.  Need to quit.  Need to quit and bfeak this fucking addication.

Your story...

As someone who is in the process of quitting, Iâ€™m intrigued to hear your stories.  

How long you have been smoke-free?

What were the trials you faced along the way both physically and psychologically?

What benefits have you experienced up to now?

I want to say well done to you as well, as much as I enjoyed smoking, I wish I had never started.  Quitting isnâ€™t easy, be proud of every hour you go without a smoke ðŸ™‚

Stopped 5 days ago, still cougthing

Hi,

Up until monday I was smoking more than a pack a day, I decided to stop because I was always coughting, a wet cought with slime coming out. Plus it costed me 300â‚¬/month.

My cought always increased after a cigarette.

It has been 5 days without smoking, the cought is still there.
Should I go see a doctor?

Thanks.

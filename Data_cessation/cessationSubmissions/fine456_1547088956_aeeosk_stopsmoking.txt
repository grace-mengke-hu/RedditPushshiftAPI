It’s been exactly one year since I quit smoking, and boy what a year it’s been. I’m not gonna lie, there were times when past demons would surface and all I wanted was one drag, but I stuck it out. To everyone on this journey, you can do it. You’re stronger than your addiction. God speed my friends.

Feeling like a complete failure...once again.

After starting my second attempt of quitting (I was already smoke-free for more than 14 months last year but started again while volunteering abroad) I failed again after only 4 weeks. I don't know why I keep coming back to this shit and I could really use some help or encouraging words.

I am 25 years old, I have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis caused by smoking.

I have not gotten to COPD yet but I realize I have to stop now or I will be dead by my mid 40's. Cold turkey is just not an option for me. I work outside a lot in construction and 99% of the people I work with on a daily basis smoke, and constantly pop smokes in my mouth when I am trying to quit. I would appreciate any tips, and tricks you all my have. Any OTC treatments that have worked. I am even willing to try some unorthodox treatments.

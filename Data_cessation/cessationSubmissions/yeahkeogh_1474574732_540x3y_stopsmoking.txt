I've been telling myself to cut back and quit for months now.

I smoke an average of 12 cigarettes a day, sometimes close to a pack a day if I'm bored or drinking. I've recently noticed that the rate at which I smoke has dramatically increased from what it was before I graduated college. So this draws me to the idea that a lot of the time I only smoke because I have nothing to occupy my time otherwise. I smoked about 13 cigarettes yesterday, I have had one so far today and want to keep it that way, and I feel that I can if I just stay adequately occupied. Perhaps I can cut down to 1 or 2 a day without severe repercussions, I smoked that one cigarette 5 hours ago and have yet to experience a strong craving. I've had a few cravings since then but they were not enough to get me to pull another one out of the pack, and I think that is a good sign. 

Just felt like sharing because I feel it helps me keep "quitting" on my mind.

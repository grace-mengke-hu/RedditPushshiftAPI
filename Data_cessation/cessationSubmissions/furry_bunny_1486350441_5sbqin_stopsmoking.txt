Dating a smoker: advice

Hi, I've been dating a smoker for almost 6 months now. When we met he told me he smoked and I was immediately a little put off. However, I decided to give him a chance because he said that he had quit and started again recently and that he planned on quitting again soon. I also found so many things about him attractive. He's sensitive, in therapy and is working really hard at school after some genuine set backs in life. I have also had a difficulties as a child, growing up with a mentally unwell mother. However, I sort of did the opposite and got super healthy as a coping mechanism.
I really would like to continue seeing him but he says he cant quit for me and has to do it for himself (which I completely understand) but he isn't able to give me a sense of when that will be. He has 6 months left of school, so he hopes to quit in the summer...however he said that last year about christmas. He smokes outside so I don't have to deal with the second hand smoke unless I decide to stand/walk with him when he is smoking. It's just painful to see someone who you care about hurt themselves. I've seen this with my mother and other family members. I really don't want to end things because of the smoking but we keep having arguments about it. I'm trying to be patient but his energy seems heavy and he snaps at me when he needs a cigarette. It's hard to know when to bring certain things up or know when his mood is going to change.
Does anyone have any advice about dating a smoker or someone with an addiction?

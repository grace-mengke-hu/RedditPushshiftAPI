Need ideas: My best friend hits her 1 year mark this month

Unfortunately I live 6 hours away and there's no way I can be there, but I want to send her something more than a card to mark the occasion. We're more of "silly gifts with a lot of meaning are better than expensive gifts" types, but I'm having trouble coming up with anything. Any ideas?

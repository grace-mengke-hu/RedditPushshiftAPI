I need to vent, but I won't complain if I get advice

I'm just so mad at myself for ever smoking my 1st cigarette and the tender age of 15. If there is one thing in my life that I regret, it would be that moment. I'm just so pissed at myself! I remember being scared to death my grandpa was going to die an early death because of his smoking, so what did my teenage self go and do???? Yes, go and smoke. Now here I am at 32, and I feel so incredibly guilty, gross, etc etc, but can't seem to kick the habit because I go INSANE when I go through nicotine withdrawls. There is no reason for it, but I can't seem to control my mind. I don't know if I need to be on antidepressants, if I need the patch, whatever....I just know I want to stop and how I behave is just stupid. It's like I can't control it....urges I can deal with, but not this insane me. Anyone else feel like this? Should I go on antidepressants before I quit? I just go nuts!! I know that if I can make it through the 1st week, I could find a way to be ok, but it's that first week I don't know how to get passed that part. I've tried everything....patch and an e-cig which just made my situation waaaay worse. So, I have to ask if anyone has had success with antidepressants or chantix? I know I just need to breathe, but try as I might I can't seem to control my brain. Fuck cigarettes...seriously!! I'm just so MAD they have such control over my brain! Thanks for listening  :)
Edit: Thank you for the responses!! I think I've gotten mad enough this evening to say I'm going to do this...I'm done smoking. So, as of 10:58 July 25 I am a non-smoker. The thing is...my brain really feels that quitting is not fun, but what's worse...quitting or lung cancer? I'll take quitting for sure!

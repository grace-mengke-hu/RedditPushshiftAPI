Can I call myself a non smoker?

I’ve been smoking for 26 years and after trying and failing several times last Monday at 9 am I had my last cigarette! My cravings have been fewer and fewer but I don’t know if that will last. But at this point am I a non smoker or am I still a smoker that’s trying to quit?

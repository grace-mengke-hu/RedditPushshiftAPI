Accountability buddy wanted!

Would anyone like to be my accountability buddy? Take a pledge together and quit FOR REAL. I am a 25 yr old female from Ny and started smoking in high school (I forget the age, probably like sophomore year)... I wasn’t smoking every day back then, just sometimes. Then when i went away to college that’s when the bad habit really started to pick up.. it seemed like EVERYONE at the party school I went to was smoking cigs and I was one of them. I always said to myself it’ll be easy to quit, I’m still young I can quit whenever. Def when I graduate I will quit. Now here I am out of school and still addicted to cigs. I tried to quit, and I did for about 8 months with a vape (if you even consider that quitting since there is still nicotine) then I eventually gravitated back towards cigs again. I smoke about a pack every 2-3 days. I bought and read Alan Carr’s book, watched his video thing on YouTube,  but for some reason it didn’t help me. I want to be done. I’m sick of it. I don’t want to be doing this any longer. I work in EMS and also in the ER and you’d think I’d be turned off from smoking after being around the sad situations that the countless COPDers, pts with lung cancer, pts we have to intubate or put in emergency traches, it’s all so depressing... yet, I Still. Smoke. I want to be done and I also want to help someone else along the way! I’m a strong believer in working together to achieve goals. And if you’d like to be my quitting buddy and are serious about quitting once and for all, then let’s seriously do this. Let’s push each other to quit those life ruining pieces of sh*t

Today is day 6 and I miss it SO much

I've been a pack a day smoker for twenty years. I've tried to quit probably 6 or 7 times. Out of those, probably 2 were serious attempts. One of those went three weeks, I cant remember what went wrong.

When I got home from a Superbowl party on Sunday night I decided, out of the blue and for no discernible reason, I am quitting tonight. 

This is it. Tonight is the last time I am the one guy at the party that gets up to go outside every 20 minutes. Never again will someone point out how nicotine-stained my right and middle index fingers are. I wont be winded anymore doing basic activities.

So, I've made it six days. I've been using nicotine lozenges and it has been very hard. The cravings feel like a two ton weight on my chest. But I'm sticking with it.

When I speak to people about quitting, I often hear the same thing, "As long as you really want to quit, you'll succeed"

Here's the thing... I don't "want" to quit. I'm quitting because I know it's the right thing to do, not because I really want to. Quite the opposite, I enjoy smoking. I enjoy the ritual and the taste and the act itself. I don't really mind getting up to go outside when no one else does nor do I care about my orange fingers.

But it seems to be a regular feature of all quitting success stories that the person became sickened with smoking. Am I alone in quitting despite how much I enjoy it? Are any of you quitting or have quit even though you didn't really want to but just because you knew you should?

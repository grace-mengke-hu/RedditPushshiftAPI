4 weeks

I'm posting this to say I've done four weeks. Mostly been easy after the few first days. Today was hard. I got sad (unrelated to the quit), and found more evidence that I've been coping facing uncomfortable feelings by smoking. Get sad > smoke. Get frustrated > smoke. Get angry > smoke. It's been good to spot this automatic reaction.

Did not smoke. I don't want that anymore. To me it would feel like giving up on myself again. I don't want to do that anymore. I guess I'll have to build new coping skills, eh? :)

Hearing the excitement in my grandmas voice has been my most satisfying reason for quitting so far.

My grandmother asked me how my quit was going and I excitedly told her “it will be a month this Saturday!” 

And I will remember the happiness in the tone of her response for the rest of my life. I never thought I’d ever get to tell my grandparents that I quit and this was a huge milestone for me.

If you’re craving and want to give in or don’t think you can do this: you absolutely CAN. I promise and then the day will come when you can tell your grandparents/parents/family/friends/etc that you quit and they can share your pride and excitement with you. Keep going!

ONE MONTH!

Never thought I would hit this much time, but i did. I could not have done it without all your posts and insights. Pro tip- get some cinnamon toothpicks and chew one every time u get a craving. It helps immensely. The Chantix is great tooo but it could be a placebo effect. everyone stay strong! Here is to another 11 months!

Last Cigarette Was 12-30-2016

So it's been three days.  No cigarettes.  I planned this for about a month and was ready to go with a plan for dealing with all the pieces of quitting and how I would deal with them!  I also have other people supporting me that I can reach-out to if I need support.  For now, I just keep repeating, "I do not smoke."  Tonight has been the toughest so far, but I'm also really tired, so maybe I'm feeling it more tonight.

I already feel better from not smoking.  Am curious to see how I feel and how things change as I get more time away from it.  I have smoked on and off (mostly on) since I was a teenager!  That's a lot of pack years.  

Right now, it really feels good to feel free of it ... I hope this feeling continues.  It helps me manage the cravings that try to settle in.  Focusing on my breath when I feel a craving or find myself thinking about cigarettes or smoking helps a lot too.

Thanks to /r/stopsmoking for being here for support.  

Happy New Year everybody!

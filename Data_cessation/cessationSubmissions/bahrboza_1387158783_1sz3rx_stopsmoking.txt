Day One as a Non-Smoker

Hey r/stopsmoking,

Just wanted to say thanks.  I quit today after using Carr's book, but I was already feeling pretty depressed even though it had only been 8 hours.  But checking out the other posts, it's obvious that there are others who are struggling, and even more who are willing to act as a safety net and offer encouragement, and that's making me feel a bit better :)

But I was wondering, to others who used "EasyWay," was the first day (or couple days) depressing and difficult or did you just sail through it?

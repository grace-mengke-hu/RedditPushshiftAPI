Day 100

I made it to 100 days, I just signed my first lease with my SO, and tomorrow I turn 26. I actually feel like I have arrived to a great state of mind; moreover, I know quitting is a major factor in this. To those just starting: you can do it and you will one day celebrate 100 days. To the veterans: continue staying strong.

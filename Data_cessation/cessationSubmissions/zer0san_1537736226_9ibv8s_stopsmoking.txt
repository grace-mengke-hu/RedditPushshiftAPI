When does cognition start to restore?

Hello,

I've been free for 59 days, but I am getting pissed of about my cognitive abilities. I feel very stupid, I have trouble starting with tasks, and I have troubles with articulating my thoughts, I stutter and mumble when talking. These things I never had when I smoked. I am getting tired of feeling stupid. I am contemplating whether I might've been self medicating ADHD or whether my brain still has to reach homeostasis. Am I simply that stupid? Or is my brain still recovering? I want an honest answer, how long does it roughly take for the brain to function normally again? I genuinely don't want to go back being dependent on anything, but I also hate feeling like an idiot. Anyone with knowledge and experience on the topic of cognition and smoking will be extremely helpful to me. I do a lot of mental tasks(math, logic, computer science, and programming) so this has affected my efficiency and productivity enormously.

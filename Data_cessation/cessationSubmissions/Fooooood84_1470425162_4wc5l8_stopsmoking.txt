Day 1: Feeling jittery and anxious

This is not my first time attempting to quit smoking, but I do intend on making it my last attempt. I feel great about not quitting! I'm worried about tonight, I run the line in a busy restaurant part time, and cigarettes are the best way to get a break and take a "breather". Ive armed myself w NPT gum and some lollipops. Wish me luck!

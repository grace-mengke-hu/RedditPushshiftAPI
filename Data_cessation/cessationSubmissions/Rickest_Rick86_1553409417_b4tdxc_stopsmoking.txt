I’m done with cigarettes

I’ve been a smoker for 10+ years and I’ve decided today to quit. I’ve been doing Chantix but I just wanna stop now. It’s ruined every relationship I’ve had. My most recent gf of over a year left me because I’d promised her twice I’d quit and broke both promises. We had talked about getting married but I’m sure that’s not going to happen now. I’m done having no money because of them, and I’m done having it control me. I don’t want anyone’s pity, I just wanted to say it out loud. So I can look at this post when I’m craving one. 

Thank you!!!

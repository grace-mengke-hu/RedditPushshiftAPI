4 holy weeks smoke-free!

After a long time 3 friends gathered and as usual One has "mari" and wants to smoke all together and make the night.. Well i refused smoking at all, i was there seeing them smoking and smoking...i've got a feeling that this time i stop Nicotine forever. Subreddit is a great place to read some good ideas and experiences. Thank you all.

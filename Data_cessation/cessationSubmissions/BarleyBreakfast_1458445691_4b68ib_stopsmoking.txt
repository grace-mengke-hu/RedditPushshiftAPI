Noticing my own warped thought process

Hello all. Today is day 6. Smoked pack and a half a day, quit with just a few pieces of gum a day when I really felt I was going to have a tantrum. No nicotine for two days now.

Today I went for a motorcycle ride for the first time since I quit smoking. I usually stop for a cig and cup of tims, every ride. It was the first time I really felt a deep sense of loss, like I'm missing a little joy. I racked my mind for any other sort of little thing I could replace cigarettes with and the process of this thought led me in a spiral that led me to consider buying a pack.

I came on this sub and browsed around, became aware of how nic withdrawal was effecting my logical thinking processes. I have a vape, I carry it with me with 0 nic in it as something to do that tastes good and imitates smoking. The whole time I was thinking about smoking, the vape never crossed my mind. Now that it has no nicotine my mind has already cast it aside, thought that was funny!

Keep it up all. I'm really happy I didn't cave earlier, and will continue to fight this thing until I can get to a stable place, free from letting chemicals take control of my concious thought.

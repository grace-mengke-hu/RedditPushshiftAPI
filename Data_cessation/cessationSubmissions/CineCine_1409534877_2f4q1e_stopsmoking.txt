Still Craving...

Day 46 and I'm still getting intense cravings from time to time (with specific triggers). I've held out, but I'm disappointed (and very unmotivated) by the fact that it isn't getting easier. Can't wait till when cigarettes are a non-issue in my life. Any tips for getting there faster?

UPDATE: Earlier on I was far more motivated and could crush all the cravings. But as time goes on I feel a lot more sentimental ... it is totally psychological, kind of like a nostalgic sadness at the loss of an old friend. And then I start to bargain: *did I quit too young? Did I have more years before I really had to quit?* (I'm 26). I know it's completely ridiculous! But in the moment it's a really powerful feeling.

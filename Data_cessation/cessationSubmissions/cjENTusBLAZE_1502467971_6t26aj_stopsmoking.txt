How old are you when you started smoking and how old are you now since your attempt at quitting ?

Reason I'm asking is because I'm in my early 20s and I think the past 5 years, I've smoked about 50 cartons of cigarettes and I feel so troubled by that fact. 

And I can't believe myself that I've been smoking that much cigarettes + the ones I bummed off of someone for that short span of time.

24 Hours into my umpteenth attempt

Long time lurker.
 
I'm about 24 hours into one of my several attempts to get out. This has been my worst crutch over the past ten years. I told myself I'd never get to this point nor would I ever become a real smoker. Boy, was I wrong. Smoking a pack a day for the past 10 years has solidified my addiction and it's become my worst crutch. 

Last year, I moved ~400 miles away from home to a place where I didn't, and still somewhat don't, know anybody. This was my own ambition but I've made it work pretty well thus far. This has been my comfort zone while perusing the city solo. I'm afraid to get close to people because of it and it's seriously deteriorating my health. I feel confident that I'm done. Seeing as I've been lurking here, I truly respect this community and it's given me a lot of inspiration and hope. 

I've got The Skinny by Atmosphere on repeat to keep my motivation up.

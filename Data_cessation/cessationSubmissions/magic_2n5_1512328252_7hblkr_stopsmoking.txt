I was about to stop smoking begging on x-mas but decided to do it from now, one question.

So backstory is that I've bought a one cartoon (10packs) of cigarettes few days ago. It was very cheap (abroad). And that I smoked about half pack daily I counted it up that I will smoke till 23th of December(that day I go to my family-home for holidays, where either way I don't smoke - my WHOLE family doesn't know I smoke and I do it since I was 15 now Im 25).

But I just fnished first pack and it's really awful and I thought I'm gonna stop it right now. (I quited about 3 serious time, first atempt was about 80 days, second 4 weeks and last time just 1 week - always cold turkey). 

Question is what should I do with nine remaning packs ?

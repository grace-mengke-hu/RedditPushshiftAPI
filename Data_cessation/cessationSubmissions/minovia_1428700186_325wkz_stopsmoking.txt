WE DID IT! 100 days free for New Years quitters! Drop in and tell us how you're doing.

I can't believe it's been 100 days since my last cigarette. The days leading up to triple digits has been a battle that we know all too well. Not going to lie, it has been one of the most difficult things I've ever experienced, but oh so rewarding.

Here is to being free, and to many more days to come.

Tell me how you're doing :)

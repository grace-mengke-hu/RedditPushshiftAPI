Incessant Cravings after Three Months: What to Do?

I used to smoke about one pack of cigarettes per day for fourteen years since age 20. Three months ago I decided to quit the unhealthy habit “cold turkey”. Since then I have not had a single cigarette or any substitute of such. Still I incessantly crave nicotine almost like it was the first day after cessation. Like absurdly much.

Like every hour of my waking day I cannot avoid fantasizing about breathing warm, delicious puffs of nicotine-laden, aromatic tobacco smoke into my lungs. Every other night I dream about smouldering, sparkling cigarettes in my mouth – with such visual vividness that I seldom experience otherwise. For the life of me: I really just want to smoke above anything else.

What am I supposed to do? Reverting is not an option – as quitting cigarettes for me is a matter of honor. But is the rest of my life going to be like this? I quite often have a hard time concentrating at work – and on multiple occasions I have cancelled social events with friends and family for the same reason. It is just “no fun” when I cannot light up.

Now what am I supposed to do?

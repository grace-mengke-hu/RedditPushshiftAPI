Trying again... I hope it sticks this time.

I should have deleted my badge a while ago but I had forgotten about this sub. Anyway, I had surgery done on my hand on Friday and haven't had a cigarette since Thursday. My doctor said the healing would go by a lot faster if I quit. The anesthesiologist also said I'd had some breathing issues during surgery that may have been exacerbated by my nasty habit.

So far I haven't had any cravings, possibly because I'm too distracted by the pain in my hand lol. I'm going through the characteristic hack-up-all-the-phlegm phase now. Seems worse than last time but I've also been smoking more heavily since last time.

The real test will be my first night out with my friends. Or the second. Or twentieth. That's where all my quit attempts fail. Wish me luck friends.

Quitting smoking

Hi everyone, im taha from tunisia, im 18ya it's my 5th day without smoking after 4 years of smoking :')
Im finding it hard, specially without having sg to replace it..( u can suggest replacements) And i have no one to encourage me and tell me to go further.. Tuesday i went to the doctor he told me tha i must gain more 24kg what is hard with smoking :''')
Thank y'all  :D

relapsed well kinda..

So i 'quit' for four months.. but was smoking spilfs tobacco and wacky tobaccy for the entire duration of that time.. knowing i was only doing that for the tobacco fix..i cant smoke joints anymore due to school.. 

the first person to offer me a cig i immediately said yes, that was wednesday.. i havent had one today.. im will quit everything. weed makes me uncomfortable.. tobacco literally kills me.. im done thanks yall

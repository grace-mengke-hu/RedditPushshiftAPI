Officially 7 days in of not smoking

And it feels clean but sick. I feel like I can breathe and I feel like my insides are literally clean. I can't sleep at all though. I'm up every night until 4am stirring and twisting and turning and it won't go away. I do have urges but I've been avoiding drinking to avoid smoking which is great. Anyone else know what to do when you can't sleep?

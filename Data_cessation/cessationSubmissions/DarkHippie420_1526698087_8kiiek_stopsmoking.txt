I feel like crap, can't sleep despite being very very tired, my body aches etc...

...but I don't give a damn. Third day without a smoke and I'm more determined than ever. I've gone through worse, both mentally and physically. I'm focusing on myself for awhile, the world keeps spinning regardless. I will come back as a better human being, a healthier human being, a nicer and stronger human being. This is it. I know it.

Peace yall.

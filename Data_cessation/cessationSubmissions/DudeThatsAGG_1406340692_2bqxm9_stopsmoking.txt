Tomorrow marks my 1 week of no nicotine cold turkey

Feeling random urges to buy a pack right now but know I'm not going to. It's been so much fucking easier to quit than I ever wanted to admit to myself. But I'm a habitual person and that is what always killed me. I guess that's why I'm posting this now, an urge came up and I had to scratch it. Haven't had this big of a gap of nicotine intake in about 5 or 6 years and am amazing myself with my newfound willpower. I have other monkeys on my back I'm slowly ridding myself of, but I thought this one would be last(seeing all my friends in rehab and AA) and has been a shining light in my life the past week.

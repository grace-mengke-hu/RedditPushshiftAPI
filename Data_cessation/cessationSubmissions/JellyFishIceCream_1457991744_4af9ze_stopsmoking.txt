Need some insights

So im writing this because i want to fully quit smoking, but there are a few things stopping or pulling me back after a given period.

*Let me note that i don't really have any cravings anymore when i quit, just a week ago i quit for 8 days and had no problem whatsoever.*

One of the things that bother me is the fact that i enjoy it to a extend, not enough to keep smoking though.
One of the others things is that i'm a real movie guy, im studying photography/videography and in cinema smoking holds a certain aesthetical aspect and many of the people that i work with smoke.
Especially shows like Mad Men leave me craving for another, even more in combination with 60's music. 

basicly i've made all sort of associations that really make me want to smoke, after all why worry about something that can kill you in 30 years when there is so much that can kill you today as the main character of Mad Men once said.


I know these reasons sound stupid and hold no real value to anyone else, but i'd like to know the best way i can make the switch in my mind to fully quit. Not sneaking a few cig's here and there at a party but fully.

Smoking is a terrible thing.

It's been little bit more than 8 months since I quit. I did it cold turkey from a packet a day for more than 15 years to deciding you know what ?  I'm not going to by another packet.

And it went well, with ups and down, hard times and easier times. But thanks to my SO and you guys I was able to do it and didn't relapse once.

But today, not once, but twice when I get up from my workstation to take a small break and grab a coffe I checked my jacket pocket. Both time I didn't understand why I was checking my jacket until I realize I was reaching for the pocket where I used to have my smokes.

I don't know what it's going on. I haven't checked this subreddit in a while, I didn't really feel the need. It's been at least a couple of months since the last time I had a strong craving, and today out of the blue, for no reason my mind was reaching for were I used to have my cigarettes.

And worst thing is that right after thinking "Why the hell I'm looking for cigarettes, I stopped smoking." I thought: "But only one would be nice, relaxing a bit and take a break like the old times, what could be the harm"

It's **insane**, smoking makes you insane. Thinking "what could be the harm" is idiotic. 

Guys, stay strong.

Smoking is a terrible thing, but you can do it.

I can do it.

We can do it, together.

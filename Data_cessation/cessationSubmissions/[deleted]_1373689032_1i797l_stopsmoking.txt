questions about quitting

I am a 20 year old who has been smoking for about 6 years. Nothing extreme, but over about the last year I was at about a pack of Camel menthols a day. Basically for the last few months I have really been feeling the effects of smoking. My breathing has felt shallow and I developed quite the cough. It has been three days since I have smoked and I have been using Camel snus as an aide. It has been working wonderfully.

My biggest concern at this point is regaining my health. I have been under the impression that I was young and I could quit with no problems when I wanted. I guess what I am asking is, how likely is it that if I didn't pick up another smoke I can regain health to the point of a non-smoker. Also how bad is it that I am using snus? I have read that it doesn't have many bad effects.

Thanks for any help and insight.

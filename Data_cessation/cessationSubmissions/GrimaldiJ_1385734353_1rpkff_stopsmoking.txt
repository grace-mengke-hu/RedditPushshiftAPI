It's been a year, yesterday!

I quit smoking one year ago yesterday. I'm so freakin proud of myself I almost can't stand it. Before I quit, trust me, I had no intention to...then i got pregnant. I found out on November 27th last year and quit for good on the 28th. Its been really hard,  especially in the beginning.  Even up till a couple weeks ago, I was still getting some serious cravings. I was really worried about after I had the baby and my husband and I would decide to have a drink, that I would really want a cigarette. The craving was there no doubt, but I had to focus on other stuff. I really can't believe  its been a year. Anyone else who's trying to quit, GOOD LUCK! It really is hard, especially if you've been smoking awhile. But trust me, if I can do it, so can you!

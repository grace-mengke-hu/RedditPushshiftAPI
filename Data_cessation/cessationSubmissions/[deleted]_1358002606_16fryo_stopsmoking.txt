Day 12 and struggling

First of all, I thought very hard about buying some this morning.....but I didn't!! I am very proud of that.

However, I'm feeling tons of cravings today...not so much for a cigarette, but a craving for the cravings to stop...does that make any sense?

The first week or so was difficult, but empowering. I felt so proud of myself. 
But the last two days have felt like a bunch of annoyingness that will never end. 

Now the newness of quitting has worn off and my brain is acting tricky...I feel like I want to reward myself for not smoking by having a smoke. I'm making a decision NOT to do that, but my brain is screaming out for a big old nicotine fix. 

Anybody farther out than me have an encouraging story about when not smoking started to feel good rather than bad?

I hear all sorts of timetables...1 month, 3 month, (someone said 7 years and they still want one every day....that pissed me off and I wish I had never heard that)

Please tell me it gets better sometime. :-/

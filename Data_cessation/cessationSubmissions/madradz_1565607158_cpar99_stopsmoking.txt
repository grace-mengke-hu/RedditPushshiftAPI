I relapsed about 7 times, within last 2 months...heres my new method

I didnt smoke for a year. After started for some stupid reason. Decided to quit. And would relapse every two weeks, coming back rougher everytime. Meaning would smoke 2 packs a day i relapsed, when before i barely smoked half a pack a day.

So what i did yesterday, i wanted to smoke but i knew it would make me feel terrible. So i video recorded myseld smoking the cigarette, from the moment i lit it up, to putting it out. I also was commenting when and what i felt. 

So, so far, ive been watching this video everytime i wanna smoke. So far 1  day of no smoking. Hope i dont relapse again. 

Im so afraid of cancer and sometimes when quitting i think "what if i already have cancer??"....im paranoic

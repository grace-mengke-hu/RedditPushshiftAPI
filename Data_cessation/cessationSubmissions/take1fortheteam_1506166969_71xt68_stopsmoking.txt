Hey Everyone! This is the beginning of the end!

I've been lurking and upvoting on this subreddit for a while now. Two days ago I decided I need to quit after having breathing problems post-coitus. I must say much of my motivation came from reading so many stories on here as well.

I decided to reduce my number of daily cigs from 17 to 10, and then 2 less per day every week. (is this a viable approach?)

Yesterday I smoked 3, lol. I didn't even believe that was a possibility at this point.

I just felt like sharing, this post has no real payoff and I apologize for that. Thanks :D

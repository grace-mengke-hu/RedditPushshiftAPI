Still smoking, but...

I'm going to re-read "The Easy Way" and try to become a non smoker. Long story short, I'm 22, started smoking around 16. Longest period quit for in that time was 2 weeks. This book was the only thing that managed to get me past those first 3 days in years. (This happened some time last year). I really want to kill that little nicotine demon inside but I can't rely on my friends to help. To them I'm the guy that "quit a thousand times because it's easy".. The reality for me, that I've known but not admitted to is that it's not easy. I know it will be hard, but so worth it. I know it will help me put on 10-15 lbs and not suppress my hunger. I know that it will let me breathe easy, look better and feel better. 

today is not the day i put down the smokes (I'm going to follow the book).  but when it comes (near future, like it did last time I read the book) what do you guys recommend I do to keep them down and fight the cravings for the long haul?

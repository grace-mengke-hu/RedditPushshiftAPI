The maximum I went without a cigarette is 24 hours.

I’ve tried quitting 3 times, and each time I couldn’t last longer than a day. 

Been smoking for a little over 6 years now. After i decide to quit cold turkey, I really really really lose control after the first day passes.

Most of not being able to quit has to do with being alone. Circumstance has it that I spend most of my time alone in my room with naught else to do, and any alternative is kind of not achievable like going out/socializing due to reasons.

So yeah, a day at most is how long I went without a cigarette. It is my firm belief that if I can go three days without one, I can go forever without one.

But those three days never pass without sweet nicotine flowing through my veins.

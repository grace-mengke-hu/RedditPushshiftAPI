120 Days!

Feels really good, fresh, clean and there is no real urge for smoking.  But I miss smoking sometimes and think about the times when I used to smoke and relax.  Whenever I feel like I need a break, I have [some fresh coffee](http://ohthiskid.com/thedailymeal/tumblr_this-is-the-thyme.gif) and do some deep breathing exercise.  


You people were of great help.  Thank you so much!

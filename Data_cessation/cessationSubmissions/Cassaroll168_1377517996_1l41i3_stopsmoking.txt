20 Days - Am I Not Ready to Quit?

It's been 20 days. I feel like by now I should be feeling motivated and strong, not missing it, glad to see it go. I should start seeing and feeling the benefits of quitting. I should start to feel my lungs open up and my smell and taste augment. But I'm not. Instead I'm still struggling with daily compulsions. I'm struggling with daily desires to go back, I want to go back. I want to go easy on myself and not have to push back on something all day everyday. I don't want to have to be at war with myself constantly.

What I'm wondering is, do I not have the full resolve to quit right now?  My girlfriend pushed me into quitting (she's quitting too) so I feel like I haven't truly hit bottom with the addiction, like it wasn't really my idea to quit. I feel like at the slightest hint of real stress or pain the monkey is gonna jump right back on my back.

I had a little epiphany the other day about how I never really liked smoking, I just like assuaging my compulsions to smoke, getting rid of my withdrawals. And I felt really invigorated by that realization. But now I'm back to where I was a few days ago, feeling weak and ready to give up on quitting. 

What I'm really looking for is for you people to tell me I'm not ready to quit and I should wait until I'm fully committed. That way it wasn't me that gave up. I was just following your advice. 

Anyway, I obviously need some help if I'm gonna keep going. Or some truth about my commitment to truly quitting. Either is much appreciated.

Today I stumbled

I stopped smoking Feb 1 2016 and today I stumbled. It was a real bad day and I picked up a pack at the store and smoked 4 cigs. I threw the pack out and the lighter and now I got that feeling that this will make me get back to that horrible habit. I am hoping that i can just tell myself that today didn't happen and continue on. Im sure this setback will not break me.

Thanks for listening.

i want to encourage anyone in the early days to persevere. it will get easier, and you will feel better and better as time goes on.

i was a really heavy smoker for about fifteen years, to the point where i was practically chainsmoking.  i found it really hard to quit, and remember thinking so many times that i couldn't do it.  

stick with it.  you will get through it.  you will get to the point where you no longer have cravings, and you don't even think about cigarettes any more.

according to the app on my phone, i've not smoked 14856 cigarettes. saved $3714 (it would be more than that as the government has increased the taxes on smokes significantly since i quit.)

if you are in the first couple of days, or first couple of weeks, don't worry *it will get better!*  i believe in you, and many other people on here do too.  i'm proud of you for going through the hard yards, and know you can do this.

there will be times when it will be hard, but that's what makes it worth doing.

congrats to you all for your decision to quit smoking!

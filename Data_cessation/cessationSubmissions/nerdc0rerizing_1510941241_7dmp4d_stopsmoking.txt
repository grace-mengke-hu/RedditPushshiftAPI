ONE MONTH!!! Hallelujah! Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

I smoked for 16 years from 14 to 30. This has been a crazy journey already. I know it's not over yet but I think the worst is behind me now. 

Anyone in that first or second week - I swear it gets so much easier and I know it feels like it's slowest time of your life right now, but looking back it just felt like another day in retrospect. A really shitty day, but just a regular old 24 hours. You can totally do this, just keep putting one foot in front of the other and focus on beating the day that's in front of you. Eventually, you'll end up at a month like wtf, how did I even get here?

Using this sub really helped me and I remember at the height of withdrawals obsessively refreshing the "new" tab all day long and now I barely remember to check here at all. I'll be around though, thanks everyone so much for all the support so far, it's for sure surreal.

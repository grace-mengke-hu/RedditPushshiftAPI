I broke again.

Seriously, nothing is more pathetic than asking for a pack of camel mental silvers in between sniffles.


Basically I’ve been trying to quit since the beginning of December. The longest I went was 5 days, with patches, but I think I’m allergic to them. There’s always a rash that lasts at least a day after I remove it, plus it itches like hell the first hour I have it on. The gum feels like it’s burning the inside of my cheeks. I’ve already tried Wellbutrin a few years ago, but it reacted with me so poorly.


I lasted 14 hours no nicotine before I broke down and bought a pack this time, but that took ALL my willpower. 


If y’all have any stories of consistent failure but ultimate success, I’d love to hear what finally helped you. Thanks.

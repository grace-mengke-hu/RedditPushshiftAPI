I just told my parents I'm smoking

I started smoking about 8months ago and as i was away (travelling) my parents didnt know until now and i felt ashame and like a fool for it because my parents always told me how bad smoking is when i grew up and i felt like im a disappointment for them but finally told them as i really wanna quit and cant do it by myself (4 tries so far, furthest i got was 6 days and then my mind fucked me like "ooh it was so easy, one will be okay" and baam hooked again.

My parents were really openminded and non-judgemental and i feel a bit better knowing that they understand and that they support my idea of wanting to quit. Im living back home for a few months atm before starting to study so them being around and being supportive will hopefully help me quit for good.

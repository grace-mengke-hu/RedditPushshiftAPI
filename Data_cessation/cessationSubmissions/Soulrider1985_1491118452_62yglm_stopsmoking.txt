Help stopping.

I'm 19 and have been smoking for 5 years now everyday. I smoke about half a pack to a pack a day. I've developed a cough where I cough stuff up, as well as my sinus's are blocked all the time. I've tried to quit multiple times but just can't find it in me to quit. It doesn't help that most of my friends smoke and I get shit for trying to quit. Any advice for my cough as well as finding it in me to quit?

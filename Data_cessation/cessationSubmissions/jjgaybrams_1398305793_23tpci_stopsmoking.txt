Today is day 20, and for the first time since I quit, I did not miss smoking today.

I know you all know what it's like; every day has been a struggle so far, but today was different. Maybe I was just to busy all day to focus on cravings, but there was no point today where I thought to myself "man, I would really love a cigarette right now." That's a huge first for me. I know it will still be tough, but today was a great showing of what it feels like to not be a slave to addiction anymore.

I also want to say thank you to everyone here who has been so helpful, I couldn't have made it to 3 weeks without your support, and I'm looking forward to many, many more smoke-free weeks, and months, and years all thanks to you amazing people.

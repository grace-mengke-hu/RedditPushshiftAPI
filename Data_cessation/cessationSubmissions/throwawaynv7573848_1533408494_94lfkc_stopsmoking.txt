I called my state’s smoking cessation hotline today!

I’ve quit in the past before, once for 6 months while dating someone who didn’t like smokers, once for a month trying vaping instead, most recently for a week while hospitalized in a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt. Every single time I hyped up the cigarette that would cause me to break my fast only to be disappointed. And then I would keep smoking anyway!
Lately I’ve been telling myself that I should be allowed to keep smoking while I get my mental health in order, but it’s been just over 3 months since my hospitalization and all I’ve done is quit my meds, quit my groups, and quit my doctors. I start going to another mental health support group (with my fiancé this time) on Tuesday. I should hear back from my appointed “coach” by then to see if I’m eligible for free cessation aids from the state (patches were the one thing that kept me sane in the hospital, though I really wish someone would have told my dumbass you aren’t supposed to sleep with a patch on). I guess it’s time to just get my health together as a whole! Sometimes I wish I would have just been successful with the whole suicide thing, but I wasn’t and the girl who loves me still wanted me around afterwards! So now I just want to focus on building us a life where she (we?) can be happy, and for that to happen I can no longer be a sad sack scraping together the last of my couch change for a pack of smokes. Here we go.

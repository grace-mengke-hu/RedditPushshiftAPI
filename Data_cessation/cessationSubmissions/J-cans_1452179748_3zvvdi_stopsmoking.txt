Beware the bucket of crabs mentality!!

Ahh the old bucket of crabs. I've noticed lately many posts that have a common thread and I want to address it for the group. Firstly allow me to explain the bucket of crabs. If you live by the coast you'll probably know exactly what I'm saying. When you have a bucket of crabs (or basket) and you try to remove just one, the other grab on to that crab and try to drag him/her back in. So much so that the crab may end up losing body parts. So, now you've got that image in your head, let's continue. Smokers are a bucket of crabs. We hang out together, smoke together, we have a common interest and common smoker related problems. We ARE a bucket of crabs. When one of us tries to quit it's so important to not let ourselves be dragged down by the other smokers. Some of us will quit easily and cause our smoking friends to turn into hater crabs. Some of us will have a hard time and allow ourselves to be dragged back in to the crab bucket where we will be greeted with "see, I knew it all along, you're back." This mentality is negative and counter productive. There is no place for that mentality when you are trying to quit anything, smoking included. It's poison and need to be neutralized. Now, I'm not saying dump your SO, disown your family, and forget about your smoker friends,no. I'm saying be aware of the pitfalls which ARE going to try to bring you back. If you're reading this you are here for a reason be it support, encouragement, answers to questions......whatever. Let's not forget to keep it positive for our quitting friends, our community here that is stopsmoking. Thanks everyone, now let's all watch out for the bucket of crabs!

Day 3: The cravings are strong on this day.

I haven't had a cigarette since Tuesday, but I'm really wanting one right now. I know blah blah blah Carr says its not about willpower blah blah, but it totally is about willpower for some of us. I'm not on the patch, vaping, taking chantix, none of that. I just kind of stopped smoking, and now I'm really jonesing. Any advice before I blow my 3rd day without smoking?

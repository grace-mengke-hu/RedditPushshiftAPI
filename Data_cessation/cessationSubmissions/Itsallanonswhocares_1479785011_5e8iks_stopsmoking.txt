Best large widget based apps? Trying to help cement my decision to kick these coffin nails for good.

So I'm sick of smoking and all the shitty side effects I keep suffering, so it's about time. My thing is that I seem to benefit the most from having a good, highly visible, homescreen based indicator of how long it's been to remind myself of what direction I should be heading in, specifically a widget. 

Yall know any good apps to help a brother out?

Relapsed 38 days 8 hours since quitting

Today has been a rough day and after 38 days 8 hours cold turkey I smoked a stick. Just barely finished it. I immediately noticed my throat getting itchy like the first time I smoked. Heart beats faster than usual. I now realize that smoking is disgusting and it does not help my anxiety at all! I’m so disgusted with myself right now. I let myself down. I’m a fool.

I've quit for no reason

Just like the majority of you, I've attempted quitting so many times i've lost count... and every time I decided to quit I had a reason for doing so... whether it was to save money, or for a new family member being brought into this world or any of the countless other reasons I came up with... but whatever the reason, after a few days I went back to smoking.

However, on the 20th of December 2014, I just said, "enough's enough" and threw away my current pack and haven't touched any since. I guess I just find it weird that I haven't came up with a reason to quit but I am still determined to give up smoking.

I couldn't be happier at this moment in time. I'm so proud of myself and feel so much better waking up in the morning and knowing that the first thing I can do is something productive rather than having a smoke.

I was just wondering if anyone else has had the same experience as me. Have you just decided that today will be the day and just stopped? 

And for the people who want to quit and haven't yet... If I can do it, YOU CAN TOO! Because I guarantee you are SO much more stronger than me.

NRT, what has worked for you? In thinking of trying this.

I had another smoke last night. Resetting my badge again(again again again again). I'm kinda sad but I don't want to give in yet. Though I'm feeling real sad. I know deep down I want this and I can do this. 

I can do it. I just have to be in this sub when ever a trigger or a thought that say - ah just a drag - hits me. 

I think I should get the NRT not sure if I should get the gum patch or vape. Any suggestions?

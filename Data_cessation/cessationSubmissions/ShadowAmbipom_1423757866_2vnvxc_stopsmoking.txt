Day 4, wish I tried quitting months ago.

Went from 17 a day to 0 on Monday. Gotta say it's been easier than I had set it up to be in my head. Electronic cigarette has helped massively with cravings (which are pretty minimal themselves bar morning and night time). Anyway just wanted to wish other people trying to quit the best of luck and hoping I'll stick with it!

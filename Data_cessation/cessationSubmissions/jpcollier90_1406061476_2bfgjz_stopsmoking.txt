smoking triggers

I am trying to quit but I have a strange situation. I have been smoking for about 7 years. I usually smoke about a pack a week. I do not crave cigarettes when sober (the vast majority of the time).

I do believe I am addicted but it is weird that I only crave smoking when drinking. My first drink on a Friday will immediately make me reach for a cigarette. Is there any solution to this besides quitting drinking? Does anyone have a similar experience?

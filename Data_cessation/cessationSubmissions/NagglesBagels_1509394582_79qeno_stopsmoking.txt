Opinions on ecigs?

What are your guys' opinions on quitting smoking with the use of ecigs? Worth the investment? Are there noticeable health improvements? Does it help or simply prolong nicotine addiction? Im curious because I actually started using nicotine via ecigs as a teen which eventually led to trying a cig, so I'm wondering if going back to ecig would be pointless or worthwhile as long as I use it with the wisdom of how shitty real cigs are?

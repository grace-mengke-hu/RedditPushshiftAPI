Day 2

Decided to quit smoking on Sunday night. Threw away my pack. Monday at 11AM (When i usually have my first and favorite cigarette of the day at work) I caved and bought a new pack. Threw that pack away Monday night and haven't had a cig since. This time of the morning is really difficult for me. New to the site and figured i would post. What has helped you get through the first week. Going on a date tonight and don't want to be miserable.

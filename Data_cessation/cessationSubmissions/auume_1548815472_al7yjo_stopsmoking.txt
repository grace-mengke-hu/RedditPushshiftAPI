Almost caved today

Started 12 hour shifts for inventory at my retail job today. Woke up at 4:30 this morning and got off work at 5:40-ish, got home and couldn’t find my juul after looking for an hour and thought “Damn, a pack can’t hurt, might as well go get one.”
But I didn’t, chewed a piece of gum and found it and fulfilled my craving. 4 days without a ciggie isn’t much, but for a habitual quitter like me it’s a good step to completely quitting this disgusting, expensive habit. Eventually going to wean myself off nicotine, but for now I’ll take what I can get.

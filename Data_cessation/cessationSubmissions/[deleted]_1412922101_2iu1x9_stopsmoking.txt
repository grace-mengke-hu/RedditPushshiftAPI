Once an addict, always an addict

Wanted to smoke so badly today coming out of the library after working some hours. I haven't thought about smoking in a couple days so that's good, but whenever I see someone smoke, I tell myself that I am not a smoker, but deep inside, I want to smoke. I stop myself though now, telling myself that smoking is nonsense. 

Something that helps me with the cravings is to breath in and out deeply just like I would smoking, with the motions and everything. If I do like 15 "puffs," my craving subsides and I just think about what to do next in my day.

I hope everyone's transitioning into the fall/winter well, esp bc smoking is more delicious in cold weather. But that's nonsense as well.

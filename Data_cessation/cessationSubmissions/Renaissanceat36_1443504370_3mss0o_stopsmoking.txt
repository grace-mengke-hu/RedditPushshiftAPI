I just smoked my last one

I have "quit" probably thirty times. 

Most recently, I quit for three days! I mean, that's pretty cool and promising! Then, I had wine. I drank wine and knew my hubby had a pack somewhere in his car. Boo. So dumb, me buying wine. I knew EXACTLY what would happen and I wanted it to happen. My mind scares the FUCK out of me sometimes.

I am now a nonsmoker. I am posting here for accountability and community. Tomorrow, my (he is now a non smoker) husband will take my wallet and checkbook with him to work. This will help. No ciggs anywhere and no way to get them. 

Here is the crazy thing.... I am an opera singer. I am a classically trained vocalist with twenty years experience who has been smoking for the past fifteen years. How fucked is that?! I am in the middle of a Renaissance (hence my user name). I have lost fifty pounds this past year and feel in control of my eating. Smoking is my next hurdle. I have a grand plan of being healthier than I have EVER been by 40. 

So, I know this is the best choice I've ever made for myself. Yet, I am scared. Yes, I've read Alan Carr. Yes. Still terrified. I have clung to ciggs as a dear old friend. It will not be easy, but the best things in life never are. 

I will check in tomorrow! 

UPDATE #1.  It's 9:00 A.M. So far, so good

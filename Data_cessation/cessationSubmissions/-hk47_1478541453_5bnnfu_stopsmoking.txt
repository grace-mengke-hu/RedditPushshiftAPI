Getting through a school week

I've got class tuesday and Thursday from 730am-8:20 pm and a lab Wednesday evening. Any advice on how to get through these times without relapsing? School is usually a big stressor/trigger for me, especially since it's hard for me to focus/not get headaches without nicotine. I only have to get through those 3 days and I'm off from Friday-Monday though.

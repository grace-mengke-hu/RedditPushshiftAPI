Current Attempt 19 hours 28 mins smoke free

I've tried loads of times to quit but only about 4 times have i been really serious about it.  Each of the four times I've failed, but each time I've learned a new trigger or a distraction or learned a way to deal with it.  Each quit attempt makes me stronger.  So ... today i start again and i promise to write more on here cos i think it helps you are such a supportive and kind bunch - thanks :)

Im freaking out rant

Not really seeing the point to this if im stressing and cigarettes seem like the answer to my peace of mind.  This pasted week i have been freaking out.  Anxiety at an all time high.  I hate my job.  Can't handle my stress.  Feel like im on the edge of a mental break down.  Really considering having a cigarette.  I know if i do its all over.  I can't just have one.  But i feel like i want one.  Im trying to find an excuse to smoke.  Madam Calment smoked from 21 to 117 thats crazy.  How can it be easy to stop but so hard to not start again.  Damnit.  In my mind i feel if id have a cigarette everything would quite down.  Fuck i have work in an hour and i don't want to go.

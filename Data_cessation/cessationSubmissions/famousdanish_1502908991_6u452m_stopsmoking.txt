Trying nicotine gum - Day 1

Hey all.

Been to this subreddit before with cold turkey quit attempts. I made it 6 months from 2015 - 2016. Right now, I got two boxes of nicotine gum prescribed to me. The copay was really low so I took them and figured I'd try them out.

Although I still believe cold turkey is the best way to quit, I am going to give the gum a try. I have job interviews coming up don't want to be in withdrawal for them, thus here's hoping a nicotine gum taper might work better with my schedule.

The science seems to be all about nicotine replacement therapy, though my anecdotal observations all point to cold turkey as the best. Regardless, here's to me giving the gum it's due diligence.

Anyway, just thought I'd make this post for some accountability and feedback. Hope to be posting here more often.

1 year since my last puff. Thank you!

I was a smoker for 5 years. It feels so great to have made it this far. This sub really helped me throughout the year. Thanks everyone!

I highly recommend Joel Spitzer's youtube videos. They provided a ton of support for me. He has a video for just about everything related to quitting and he's incredibly informative.

Towards Freedom. I Quit Today.

I took my last puff 10 mins ago. I had decided that today would be my last day smoking and coincidentally today is anti-tobacco day. I take it as a sign that I took a right decision. 

To make sure I don't fall and remain on this path I have decided to donate the amount of money I used to spend on ciggrates to some organisation working against tobacco or cancer prevention. I calculated and I used to smoke 2350 rupees worth of cigs in a month. So I would be donating that amount every month for a year. So anybody here aware about such ngos in India please comment me some suggestions.

Now reasons of quitting. Making this for self reference so I can always look at it when cravings hit:

1. I want to breathe again. No more blocked air flow and irreregular breathing. This would also help in meditating.
2. Better skin.
3. I want my senses of smell and taste back.
4. More stamina. Better cardio and workout.
5. I don't want to smell like ashtray.
6. CANCER!!!
7. FREEDOM. Freedom from a shitty habit which contribute nothing to my life.

I will get rid of this habit whatever it takes, nrt or willpower I am ready for anything.

Any suggestion for what to expect and how to handle withdrawals would be appreciable.

Thank you this sub for existing and all the motivation.

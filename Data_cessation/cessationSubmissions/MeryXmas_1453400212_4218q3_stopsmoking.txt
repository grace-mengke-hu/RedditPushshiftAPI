Smoking for a year, had my first cigarette after a week cold turkey.

I kept telling myself I would quit on my next pack. When the pack ended I would pick up another and say the same thing. At most I lasted 2 days until I gave in. I used to have a vape so I could stay off the cigarettes but it was just substitution.


I finally said this is it. This is the end. I managed to do a week. It was horrible. The cravings were endless. I had a friend I would message every time I wanted to go pick some up. He kept me sane. After a week I was feeling good. I could taste things again, really taste them. I was breathing easier. I smelled nice. Things were looking up.

Then I caved. Last night was stressful and I decided to go pick up a pack. I needed that comfort. I was wrong. So wrong. My first cigarette tasted absolutely disgusting, I hated it. I couldn't believe I had been doing this for a year. I immediately regretted it. I'm throwing out my pack. I don't need these. 

I think I can do this. I know I can.

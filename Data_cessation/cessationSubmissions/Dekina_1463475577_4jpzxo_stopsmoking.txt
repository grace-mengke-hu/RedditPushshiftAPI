Why Brain, WHY?!

So I am now 81 days completely nicotine free and 103 cigarette free.

The last couple of days has been really hard. I have had a smooth quit up until now, no major cravings, no going insane-moments, no snapping at people and hating everything. I had some health issues that flared up like crazy as I was going through the first few weeks, I think that maybe had something to do with it.

But now? These last 4 days? It's the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning, and the cravings are so bad through out the day, that I can actually feel the smoke in my mouth. You all know how it feels.

I have no idea why my brain has decided to play tricks on me now. I am NOT loving it. 

How do I best avoid a relapse? Because, at this rate, I'll be smoking again before the sun sets.

Almost 20 days!!! Wooooo

So I never thought I would come that far. I stopped the 1st September, lapsed twice and had my last cigarette the 12th of September. Almost 20 days! It has been super tough: cravings, nervous, anxiety, sad, not want to do anything, think hat life without cigarettes is not worth it, sleeping disturbance... But I'm starting to feel better finally!!! The last few days the cravings have been a bit stronger (guess the 3 week cravings?) and now going for a holiday next week. I'm so so so nervous as I haven't been in the terrace of a bar/restaurant with friends having a wine and some of them smoking and I'm really scared! Any suggestions please? Thanks, we can do this! 💪☺️

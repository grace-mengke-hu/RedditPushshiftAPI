Do you find you started replacing cigarettes with something else?

I quit smoking, and around the same time I stopped smoking weed regularly too. I find I've turned to crappy foods.

Smokes are over $10 a pack here, but I find I've been spending just as much on junk food. I'm not overweight or anything, so it could be worse I guess, but I was definitely eating way too many Jalapeno Cheetos for the first few weeks. I actually noticed some weird health things I never had before, and every time a possible explanation was too many spicy foods.

So I cut that shit out.

What new addictions did you find yourself taking up?

Day 5 smoke free - Thinking of stopping the Champix

I have finally had some kind of lightbulb moment this time around, and believe me i have tried to quit about 20 times or more.... at one point quitting smoking was a weekly event that never happened. I have been back on the Champix Tablets since Last Monday, but actually stopped smoking Last Wednesday so this is day 5 nearly 6 for me. This time I am really motivated by Money and Health, and I am never going to allow myself to ever just have "That ONE" ciggy ever again.
Thinking of coming off the champix already after 1 week on them, as they are making me feel really rough.... I do not know if this is a good idea or not.

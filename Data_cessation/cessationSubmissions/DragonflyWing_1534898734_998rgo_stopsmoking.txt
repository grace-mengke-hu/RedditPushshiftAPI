What can I do to ease the irritability?

Besides alcohol and Xanax lol (not at the same time.)

I'm getting frustrated with my kids SO easily, and I feel really bad when I snap and yell at them. I'm a generally unpleasant person to be around right now.

My cravings are worse at night, as I had a ritual where I would lay in my hammock outside, smoking and watching YouTube videos, and it was my way to unwind after a long day.

Now when that time rolls around, I feel restless, cranky, and nothing makes me happy. I don't actually crave a cigarette, but I crave SOMETHING. Sometimes it's chocolate, sometimes iced tea, of all things. But I just want something and I'm super cranky when I can't have it.

My family is suffering and walking in eggshells around me. When will it pass, and how can I get my shit together until then?

I quit smoking for 6 months now but i want to smoke weed . What to do ?

I finally quit smoking before 6 months after many failed times trying to and i feel great  . But i will go for 3 days with friends in a cottage and i really want to smoke some weed . I havent smoked weed since i stoped smoking because i am afraid that if i put any cigaret in my mouth i will go back to it . What to do ? Do you guys think that smoking weed can bring me back to ciggaretes?

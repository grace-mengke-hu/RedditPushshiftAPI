Relapse after almost a week :(

This was my first time really trying to quit...I was ok since this morning when I realized that I wasn't able to concentrate for more than 3 minutes at work and I have an important deadline in 2 months and lots of work... And on top of that a few personal problems :( I feel really stupid to have fail because the cigarettes, even if it helps me focus, really taste like shit after 5 days not smoking!!! It's really disappointing :///
My question is, would you advise to give up again right away or wait for 2 months to be a little bit more at peace with work and other ?

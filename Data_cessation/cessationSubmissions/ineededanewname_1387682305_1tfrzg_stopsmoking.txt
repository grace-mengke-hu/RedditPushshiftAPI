I caved in last night.

I was studying with two other people for our final exam last night and the guys both smoke. Normally, I don't have a problem with people smoking in front of me but this time I was having doubts and wasn't focusing on the studying so much as the internal resistance of smoking. Alas I caved in and smoke two cigarettes with the logic that I'd rather smoke these two and focus then waste my last night before the exam not studying.

I'm not going to start at day 0 again because I still consider myself a non-smoker who smoked two cigarettes the night before. A minor bump in the big picture.

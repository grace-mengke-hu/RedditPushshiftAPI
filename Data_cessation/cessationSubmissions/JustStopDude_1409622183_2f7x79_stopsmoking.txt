Not even sure how long it has been...but I am struggling like crazy tonight...

I stopped smoking about two or three months ago. I never was a really heavy smoker, less than a pack a day, but I work in steel mills and ports...so I am sort of around it all the time. Just last week, I was stuck in Blythevill, Ark and they actually still allow smoking in their bars...so naturally whenever the customer would take me out, I was inhaling second hand like crazy.

I could punt a baby right now for a smoke. I know I got a half of a pack in my apartment somewhere. Even if I didn't, I live above a bar so just getting one is as easy as walking out the front door and talking to a drunk. 

But instead...I am whinging away on reddit...FUCK I WOULD EAT A PIECE OF DRYWALL THE SIZE OF MY HEAD FOR A SMOKE!!!

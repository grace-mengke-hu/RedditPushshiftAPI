Stopped smoking 2 weeks ago now I feel I can't concentrate anymore, how did you guys deal with this ?

I'm 25 and smoked 2 years, mostly I used to smoke to kickstart things I wanted to work on and combat fatique, after two weeks I feel obviously feel tired, but the lack of concentration is something I worry about more, I've read "the easy way", any tips on how to deal with this ?

Decided to quit cold turkey

Hey guys, 
I just decided to quit cold turkey. I will be going on vacation in a week, which would make things really easy cause we are going to travel around and there wont be that much chance to buy cigs (especially since I am completely broke).
Now here is my question: Normally I smoke around a pack a day and it has become a huge habit of mine. As I am editing videos a lot (working from home) I tend to smoke and work at the same time. Now I need something to take my mind off work now and then and NOT think about smoking...any tips? Anything else that keeps me busy, especially busy NOT SMOKING...?

Thanks a lot in advance guys!

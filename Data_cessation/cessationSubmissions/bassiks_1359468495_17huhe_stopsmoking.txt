8 weeks in!

8 weeks and 2 days since I completely quit. I was using nicorette sprays to wean myself of nicotine and they worked amazingly,  haven't needed to use one for a couple of weeks now. 
I have tried to quit a few times before but always failed due to a complete lack of motivation to quit, just pressure from others around me to quit which never works!

The thing that gave me the motivation I needed was my daughter being born, I smoked as normal that day until I seen her, then nothing for the past 8 weeks. It's been an incredible contrast compared to my past experiences of quitting. Now me and my daughter are completely smoke free! 

One thing I have noticed is I'm completely free of cravings for nicotine, I don't need or want it anymore but it's the taste I miss sometimes, if I walk past someone smoking then sometimes it disgusts me, other times it smells amazing, I want to cuddle strangers lol.

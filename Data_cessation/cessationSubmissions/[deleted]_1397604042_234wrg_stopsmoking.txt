Almost 12 days in! Things are good

*sorry if this sounds like bragging, but even so it could be more inspiration for quitting*

Time has flown right by with quitting! I wrote here first when I was on day 7, but 5 days later and still going strong and I hope you all are too! 

I do not know if the worse is yet to come, but I rarely feel any urge to have a smoke now. My willpower and self-discipline are at an all time-high and only going higher with each craving I deny myself, and I'm slowly looking a bit healthier. Breathing has gotten easier. Better habits are forming naturally and things seem more enjoyable! Added bonus for the single men here: most ladies like themselves a healthy guy who doesn't smoke so hehehe creepy troll face :P 

Good luck to you all!

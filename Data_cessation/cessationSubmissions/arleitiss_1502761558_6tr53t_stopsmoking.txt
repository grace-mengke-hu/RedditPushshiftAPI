How to keep myself away from it?

Hey, could long story short:


I used to smoke but then I switched to e cigs, then I ended up in coma for 2 months and after I awoke I didn't feel like smoking again so I quit completely. 

3 months later I had some friends over and they accidentally left a pack of cigarettes. I just kept them in case any of my guests run out of them but today watching a movie and having a drink I decided to try it..... 


So I had one smoke, and if felt good, very relaxing and calming but at the same time I noticed how much smoke I can exhale and if made me realize how much I have recovered as my lungs now function 100 percent.. I so I threw whole pack into bbq and set it on fire with fire liquid to destroy it. 


I have a fear that that one smoke had just fucked up my lungs and set back my recovery by 100 %.




So my problem is :


How much did that one cigarette set back my lungs? 


and


Any advice from staying away in future?

Hitting 365

Hey all. I'm about to hit one year in a few hours, and I wanted to thank this community for helping me to make that happen. You introduced me to Alan Carr and Easyway, which made a huge difference for me. And reading the posts here helped me to make it through some of the more challenging times. I quit in the past for a few months at a time, but I never had the right mentality for it until I found /r/stopsmoking. This sub made me realize that I did not need cigarettes. That there are no circumstances where smoking a cigarette makes sense. It sounds stupid, but just recognizing that changed everything. There is no doubt in my mind that this subreddit has added years to my life. 

A sincere thank you to everyone who makes this subreddit what it is. I am eternally grateful.

Struggling!

The last three days have been pretty rough. There have been no added stress or any real situation that has made me want to smoke. I just want to. It's strange that up until this point of my quit I never "wanted" to smoke, just craved it. Now I'm feeling like I'm not exactly craving one, but want one. I feel like I miss it I guess. I've smoked for 16 years of my life, so it has been a huge adjustment to suddenly not smoke. 
I've been tough on myself and I have not smoked. But I am finding it harder and harder to fight the want for it. 
It also scares me a little to come on this sub and see people who have been quit for months or even years talk about how they slipped up or really feel like slipping up.. It makes me feel like I am going to feel like this forever. I'll be fighting the urge to smoke constantly forever. 
Sorry, I just really needed to vent, and get all this off my chest, everyone around me is so please with how I have been doing anytime I mention wanting to smoke I just get yelled at.

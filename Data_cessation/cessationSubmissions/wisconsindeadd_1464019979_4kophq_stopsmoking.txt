250 Days!

Might as well post about it. 

I'm really getting in the groove of being a non-smoker. I now have days where I don't think about cigarettes at all. Which is something I didn't have during the first ~6 months. Additionally, I still notice improvements with regard to what used to be regular chest/heart pains. They have really begun to be a thing of the past. Its cool to notice these slight improvements after having quit so long ago.

You guys can do it! There is life after cigarettes!

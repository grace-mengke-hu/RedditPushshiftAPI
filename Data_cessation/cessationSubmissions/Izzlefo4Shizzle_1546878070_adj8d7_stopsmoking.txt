Day 4 Temptation

My first day out this time round with my quit. Its day 4 and of course every where I turned in the streets....a cigarette was being lit. Go to a new hairdressers and the first thing I see? Hairdresser outside having a cig hahaha. Hair took a long time as Im now reinventing myself as a non smoker....hairdresser is having smoke breaks every chance she gets and I would have been the first to light up with her before....and by God it was tempting when she offered me a cigarette. And I nearly got all preachy with her when she said 'but I ENJOY smoking....why would I need to quit' ooooh the classic line that we've all used in the height of our brainwashing and addiction....but Im no better than her because I see the light however Im still an addict myself hahaha. But I managed it....somehow hahaha. Thought my love/hate relationship with cigs was just hate now....but definitely not. Gggggrrrrr. Cant wait until the hump goes and I can handle this better psychologically....which I know isnt that far away if I keep pushing through. Stay strong on all your journies too.

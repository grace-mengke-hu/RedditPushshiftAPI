I want to quit

Hey friends. I have made up my mind to quit again. Every time I go back to smoking it slowly becomes a habit and I stop thinking about all the negative effects of smoking.. it's scary when a bad action turns into a habit. Smoking is a self-destructive habit. I want to quit. Any tips and advice? Thanks :)

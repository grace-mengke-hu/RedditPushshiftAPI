Non-Smoker for 38 days & need some advice...

1. I am sleeping SO MUCH HARDER/BETTER! I, for some reason, am sleeping my hardest between 4am-7am. I need to be up for work by 5:45-6am...it seems that my AM cig was my "reason" for waking at 5 or 5:45? Ways I can work this out?

2. Still having bad stomach issues (TMI coming ahead)........


going to the bathroom every 2-3 days. This is miserable. Diet has not helped (fiber & water). Miralax neither. Any input on this would be heavenly!!

Thank You!

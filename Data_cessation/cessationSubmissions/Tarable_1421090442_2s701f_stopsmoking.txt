Check me out! 100 Days!

It feels like 10 years since I've quit smoking...100 days for some reason doesn't feel like much, but I'm really reaping the benefits.

I started running when I quit.  I joined a local running group, and I'm now doing 6 mile runs and training for a half marathon.  Whenever I have a craving (which has gotten much better the past couple weeks; they are less frequent), I go for a run to remind myself that I can run long distances and actually breathe!

If I went back to smoking, I'd have to give up running, I'd have to give up the races, and I'd have to give up hanging out with the super supportive people that make up the running community.  These running communities are really something.  The nicest, most supportive people I've ever come across.  There's just that much more to lose to smoking.  

Good luck everyone!  You can do it!

Doesn't seem like 57 days

I was using the patch and given I've used it successfully in the past, I'm kinda used to the patterns.  But I swear to you, today doesn't feel like day 57.  It feels like day 2 where every 18 seconds my thoughts move to how awesome a cigarette would be or how I could sneak one from person X.  It's a pain in the ass since I was over this weeks ago!  Still staying strong, it's just frustrating when you think you're past constantly thinking about it only to return to constantly thinking about it.

Anyways, thanks for letting me vent.  It helped. :)

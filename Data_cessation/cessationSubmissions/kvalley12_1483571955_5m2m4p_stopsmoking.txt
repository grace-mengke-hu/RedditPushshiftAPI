Day 5 here

Haven't smoked consumed alcohol or coffee in five days. Eating healthier and getting back into the gym! ( quit the coffee to help with sleep and I've actually been a lot less anxious through the day) Also my new job calls for a lot of paying attention to small detail. I find myself spacing out because I'm in such a fog I have to really tell my self to snap out of it or I'm going to miss something important. Any suggestions ? Thanks again you guys rock !

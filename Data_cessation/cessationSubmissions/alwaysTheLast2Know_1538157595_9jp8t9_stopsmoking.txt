MSG from your future self

Dear me-two-years,

&amp;#x200B;

You will be quitting in 2 days!

&amp;#x200B;

Our nicotine addiction was so bad that we were chain smoking and still craving nictoine. We constantly felt dirty, and agitated, and had the annoying feeling like there was always something we had left to do (similar to knowing you have to do the laundry) as we always had to have that last cigarette before meals, before bed, before showering, before work, before long car rides, before settling into a tv show. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It was a source of embarrassment that we tried to hide from family and friends. People often equate bad habits with bad people, and while we knew they are wrong to, while smoking we couldn't help feeling judged, pitied even, and disgusting around others.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember the first time we quit and gained weight? Remember when we started smoking again we didn't lose any of that weight. I just want to let you know that since we were aware of our previous mistakes, this time didn't overeat...and we didn't gain any weight. In fact, we started going to the gym. Remember when used to feel like a sham smelling like cigarettes on the treadmill next to health conscious people, but now we can blend in with the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes we saved money, and are healthier. But I know it the horrible feeling of needing something just to remove the feeling of needing it that will drive you to quit. I know that relieving the burden of the shame you have will feel like winning the lottery. Remember smoking in the yard so your kids wouldn't see? Well in a couple of days they will find cigarette butts and say "we need to talk". As adorable as that was, you know that will make them think a little less of you, or possibly even plant the thought of smoking when they are older into their heads.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say- that in two days you will finally do it. And it will feel weird at first. And you will avoid certain triggering situations... but it's all so much better than starting from square one again. Just remember if you fall off the wagon it will be weeks or months of self hate before you can bring yourself to try again... I'm happy to tell you you didn't fall off the wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

You rock! We rock!

Addicts of reddit who are trying to quit. Please read this in its entirety

I used to freak out if I went somewhere and didn’t have my fix with me, and If I didn’t, I would go buy more. I used to run off to the bathroom every chance I got so I could get my fix, leaving my friends and family in the other room while I went off with my addiction. Besides the health problems nicotine causes, it also causes problems with friends and family. All those moments were I left the group so I could get my fix are moments lost. Conversations I didn’t partake and never will be able to again. All for a chemical that makes me feel different for a few minutes. Some were avoided on purpose and some were missed because I didn’t have the self control to stay in place and not run off and get my fix. I hid my addiction from my family. At least, I thought I did. Until my father told me he knew I had an addiction, which at that point it had been years since I started. 

I am now 16 days without nicotine and these are my realizations. This is something I would’ve told myself if I had known the true cost of nicotine addiction.

If you quit, your life will change. Your priorities will change. Your perspective will change. The life you were living will not be the life you live anymore. If you are an addict and want to change your life, stopping will do exactly that. You will have more time and more energy.

You have the power to quit. You have the power to free yourself from those weights around your neck and live a free life. You can do that for yourself. Like the old saying goes, where there’s a will, there’s a way. YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!

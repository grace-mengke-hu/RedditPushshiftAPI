I know I need to stop but I don't know how.

I'm 15 years old. I've been smoking on and off for about a year and a half, but I only seriously picked it up in the past 6 months. I smoke 10-15 a day and I don't pay a penny for them. I wake up and go about my day until an opportunity presents itself. 

Every day, I get another opportunity. Maybe someone wants to trade tobacco for bud or pills (which I have but don't have a problem with consuming as I do with cigarettes), maybe I walk past someone I know smoking on the way to school. When I get truly desperate I walk 30-40 minutes to the next town to scab cigarette ends off the ground and reroll them into one. 

When I wake up I can feel it in my lungs.  I need to stop but everyone in my social class smokes or has cigarettes to trade. What can I do?

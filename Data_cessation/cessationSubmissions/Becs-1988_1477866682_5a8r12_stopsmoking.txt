Can anyone offer any advice? Gross subject (just warning you)

Hi guys,

Its a gross subject so i apologise in advance! I quit a month and ago but vaped for a few days so been completely nicotine free for around 2 and a half weeks but i'm just so constipated! 

I haven't been for days and its killing me!

Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to help ease the situation? 

Sorry again for too much information and woohoo for the month that I have been a non smoker!!! 

:-)

DONE FOR GOOD. This time, I'm not going back.

Hello, I'm 18 years old and tonight I finally decided I'm done smoking forever. Me and two of my friends made a pact that none of us will smoke a cigarette ever again. I've been smoking for about a year now and I knew I should've never started. 

My mother caught tonight me with a couple behind my ears and asked, "cigs or pen?". I lied and told her it was a vape pen. I'm not sure whether or not she was drinking but I'm pretty sure she knew they were cigs. She was always tolerant of me drinking or smoking weed or doing any other drugs, but not smoking cigarettes. I finally decided to stop completely because I want to live a healthy life.

Cigarettes:
1. Don't get me high
2. Make me smell bad
3. Turn off women
4. Disappoint my mother
5. Take years off my life

I'm done forever. This time I mean it! I've tried quitting before but, the social influence is strong. 

Wish me luck! I'm going to buy a vaporizer so I can combat the urge to smoke and live a healthier life.

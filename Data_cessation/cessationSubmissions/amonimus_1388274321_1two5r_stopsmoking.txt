Six days - first time quitting -

This sub has been very helpful. Thank you all.

I'm six days into quitting. Got a cold, and have kept going after I got better. Getting a pretty short temper - tips for dealing with this would be appreciated - I think it's because I really want to smoke but can't. 

Thinking about an ecigarette after reading someone else's post - is there a consensus if this leads to smoking again?

Anyways, hope this continues.

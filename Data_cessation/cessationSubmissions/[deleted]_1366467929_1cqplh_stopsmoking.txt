Fuck it! I'm done. I've failed and failed before, but I am not going back this time.

Been talking a lot about when I'm going to finally quit smoking lately.

I've tried and failed a lot before.

I had one or two this morning and then I crumpled up my pack that had some left inside and threw it right in the trash.

So begins DAY ONE -- to feeling like a new, better, improved me.

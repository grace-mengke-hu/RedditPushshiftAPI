The feeling of waking up and realizing you went another day smoke-free is so excellent

I've been smoke-free for 3 weeks now. Every morning I wake up, among my first thoughts are "Wait... I didn't smoke yesterday!" It feels great.

I've been experiencing mad chest/lung pain for the last few days. Hoping that goes away soon.

Day 1

Hello everyone. Welp, my Quit Date has arrived. Today is Day 1. 

I have been a pack-and-a-half a day smoker for a total of 10 years. I did manage to quit once for 2 1/2 years in 2011. 

I am ready to reclaim my health and freedom from cigarettes. I will be quitting Cold Turkey. 

Happy to be here with all of you.

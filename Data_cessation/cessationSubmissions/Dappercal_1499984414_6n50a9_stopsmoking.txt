I feel guilty when people ask how my quit is going

I'm eleven days in on a quit, after twenty years of a pack a day, and so far it has been *exceptionally* easy. 

I started off by vaping as I quit, but a few days in, I read the Allen Carr and cut out the vape, as well. 

I've been around my smoker friends, I've gone out for drinks, I've had some really stressful days.  All of my usual triggers. When someone finds out I'm quitting, they ask me how it's going, and I feel super guilty telling them that it's actually going really, really well. 

I've quit before, and had the typical hard time of it. I don't know why this time seems to be so easy, but it also makes me kind of nervous - like the other shoe is going to drop at any moment. It seems crazy, but I actually feel like I'm disappointing people when I tell them how well it's going.

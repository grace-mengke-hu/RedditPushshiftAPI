Third time is the charm.

Hey peeps, 3rd attempt at quitting here. each time something has happened that i've started smoking (suicide in the family, family member raped) that sort of thing.

each time i've started smoking again i smoked more and more. most recently i've been on 30 a day. But in Australia smoking has become hugely expensive, I was spending $30 a day on a pack.

my question is, what the hell do i do with my time?? i've got a minimum extra two hours of time (4 minutes per smoke) but it'll likely be closer to 3 hours due to prep time and what not. 

I already go to the gym 3 times a week, i could increase that i guess.

I've honestly got no idea what to do, i've been on the verge of buying a pack just to fill the day.


Any tips or advice would be great

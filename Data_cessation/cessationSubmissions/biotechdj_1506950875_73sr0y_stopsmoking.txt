Tired of nicotine

Hey guys, I just can't seem to quit smoking. I know it's a willpower thing. I've been on chantix twice and it's worked great until I finish it and then think I can smoke just one cig here or one while I'm drinking. When it comes to smoking, for me, one means starting all over again. I even got a vape to help but I switched back! I'm starting the vape again today. Not really sure why I posted. Have any tips?

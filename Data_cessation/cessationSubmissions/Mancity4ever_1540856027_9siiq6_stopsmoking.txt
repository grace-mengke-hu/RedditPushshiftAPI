[198 days] Request help !!

I have been 6.5 months clean from any form of nicotine. Unfortunately my cravings have increased a lot in the last couple of days :( I lost my visa, my phd apps were rejected, lost my job and now the in-laws are torturing me and trying to make sure their daughter doesn’t come to me. It’s been so bad that I dreamt of smoking a cig which immediately made me calm. 
Apart from the 3 minutes, water and breathing tips are there other things you would recommend to handle stress and cravings? Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you in advance.

I threw my smokes and my lighter away! Now it's just mind over matter

How do I know it's mind over matter? Because once a year I go on vacation with my wife and kids. And I didn't smoke in front of them for a week. 7 days! I didn't think about it, hardly at all. I just got it in my head that I wouldn't and couldn't smoke on vacation. 
One thing that helped was that I was with them, all the time. So the thought of smoking rarely entered my mind. 
Once you decide, truly decide that you can't do something... you can do anything.

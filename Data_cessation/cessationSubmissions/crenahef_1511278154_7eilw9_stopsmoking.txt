10 Days!!!!

its been 10 days since my last smoke and i feel awesome! from time to time iÂ´ve notice some cravings but just for a second and then just like nothing. i will not lie its been really hard, the  first 5 days i was so angry at everyone and in a really bad mood but i stay focus in my goal and i know a can do this

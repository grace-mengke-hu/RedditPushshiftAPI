So its my first Day, after several tries but I feel pretty good now.

So I smoked my last cigarette yesterday evening. 

Its now 2pm (germany) and I feel so good. 

Of course the cigarettes are always in my mind, but I dont deny those thoughts, I accept them and realise that they will go away eventually. 

I know that I wont ever touch them again and it feels good to smell and taste slowly. 

Of course the reason for quitting, was allen carr. 

Greetings from germany

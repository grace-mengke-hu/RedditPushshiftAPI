Finally putting my badge back up.

I had to take down my badge a couple months ago. But I stayed subscribed here, even though looking at these posts kinda makes me irritated. Hahaha. Well I got sick on Wednesday and could not smoke, so I haven't smoked for two days and I figure why not quit now? I'm gonna own this shit.

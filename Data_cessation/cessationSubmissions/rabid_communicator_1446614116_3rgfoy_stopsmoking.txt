They made me want to smoke before, and they make me want to smoke now....

WTH is up with the anti/quit smoking ads??? Before I quit and they came on TV I was all "Oh ya LOL I should go smoke a stoge thanks for the reminder hahaha!" Now I'll be peacefully watching TV and these ads come on and I'm like "GOD DAMMIT I WAS SITTING HER WITH MY FAMILY NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT SMOKING OR FIENDING UNTIL YOUR SHITTY WASTE O MONEY CAMPAIGN CAME ON AND NOW I REALLY WANT ONE!!!!!"  
  
Fuck you, anti smoking ads, you've been the biggest stumbling block so far....

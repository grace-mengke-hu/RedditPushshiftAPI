Another thing I enjoy about being an ex-smoker.

This is the first time I experience being sick (flu) as a non-smoker in 13 years. It is tremendously different.

This time I was lying in bed for only 5 days with flu symptoms until I felt alright again. No drugs needed. Only tea, some thai soup and netflix. Not that bad. 

As a smoker, I kept smoking while being sick (because I was that kind of addicted) which prolonged and amplified many symptoms like coughing, headaches, mucus everywhere, blocked nose etc. for 2-3 weeks. And it actually hurt more, the sore throat, the coughing, the lungs - everything had to work even harder, I gave myself not what I needed in order to heal properly. Actually I gave my body exactly the opposite of what it needed.

Never again, fuck you cancer sticks.

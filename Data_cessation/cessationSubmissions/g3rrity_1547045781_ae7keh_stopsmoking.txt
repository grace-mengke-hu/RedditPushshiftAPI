Cravings that don’t seem to pass

What do people do when cravings seem endless? I thought they were supposed to generally pass in like 15 minutes. I’m sitting here for the past hour fantasizing about going to the store, buying cigs or a cigarillo, and just deeply inhaling. Tried walking around, eating something, doing push-ups. I can’t concentrate on anything else but wanting to smoke, wanting to feel that throat burn and exhale.

Protest The Hero - Hair-Trigger. An interesting hate song about cigarettes from an ex-smoker.

I just thought I'd share this as I'm quitting today and this song is giving me a lot of inspiration. You may not all like it, but if it's not your kind of music, have a look at the lyrics. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/genius.com/amp/Protest-the-hero-hair-trigger-lyrics

The whole thing is a typical twisted love-hate song, but the object of his desire is smoking. The singer, Rody Walker, had a nightmare trying to quit, and for a long time was convinced he genuinely liked them. The 'wrote a goddamn love song' line is actually about a joke song he wrote and performed called 'Pro Smoking Cigarette Song' that he massively regrets for possibly inspiring people to smoke. 

Just thought I'd share what's giving me strength to stop today!

4 months smoke free!!!!!

Hi everyone,
I haven't been on this page for a long time but wanted to share that I have now hit the four month mark. I was a chain smoking, cigarette loving addict for nearly 15 years and decided enough was enough. I wanted to stop before my 30s (30th was three weeks ago) so decided to give up for Stoptober. 
My partner still smokes, most of my friends still smoke and I have not had ONE puff. I was able to drink A LOT of alcohol through the Christmas period and my 30th birthday too. I do not even want one. I also haven't had ONE cold this winter, this time last year I had already had around 4 or 5.
Things that helped me quit:

•	This subreddit, I checked this subreddit every day for the first month or so and it really helped me to read others quit stories

•	Using the smoke free app (the paid for version not the free version)

•	Taking Kalms occasionally (I have anxiety anyway so already used these before I quit, they are a mild relief of stress/anxiety)

•	Stopping smoking with a close friend and messaging each other most days in the early stages

•	Using a nicotine free vape when drinking for the first couple of times but I don't need that at all now. I have passed it onto a friend who is stopping smoking as a new year resolution hoping it will help her now

•	Allen Carrs book. I read this years ago though and although I agreed with his points, it did not help me to give up at the time but I still have his words of wisdom in the back of my mind so having that knowledge definitely helped this time round


Bad news is I have gained about 12lbs (I ate a lot of c r a p over xmas though), however I am now taking up power walking, jogging, monitoring calories and exercise through my fitbit etc. to lose that and can tell you my lungs are AMAZING so the exercise is so much easier. Stopping smoking is the KEY to becoming healthy. 

Also to add - my anxiety levels are SO much lower too!!

Best of luck to you all. When you first stop if feels like forever but you will eventually be at this point and just remember to never have another puff!

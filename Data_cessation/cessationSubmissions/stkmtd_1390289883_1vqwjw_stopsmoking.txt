One week, keeping the mind in order

I nearly broke down yesterday and ordered an ecig (no nicotine, but it's clear that my mind has a strong dependence on useless procrastinative activities like blowing smoke rings).

This is the first quit where I'm focusing on trying to make a meaningful change for a meaningful reason. I want to be free of all addictions, and time-wasting activities. I want to experience my mind and body in their rawest form.

If you need something external to feel whole internally, what's the point?

It's been more than avoiding nicotine, as I've clearly masked 6 years of depression and general disatisfaction with life by smoking. Whether that was cigarettes or pot.

I also drank way too much freaking coffee. (on that note, this is one to watch out for. Caffiene hits you harder during nicotine withdrawal, I think I've made this mistake in the past, and the agitation eventually pushed me to smoke again).

Now I'm clean in every way that it's possible to be so.

Best of luck to everyone on this journey. Looking forward to hauling ass with you.

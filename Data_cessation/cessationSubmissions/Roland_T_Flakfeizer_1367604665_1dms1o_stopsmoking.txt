Any help on handling mood swings?

I should be on day 7 right now.  Instead, I'm debating whether or not to reset my badge.  First four days, I felt great - I was excited, motivated, exercising every day.  Come day five, I started having pretty hardcore mood swings.  I'm a pretty level-headed calm guy in general, when I get upset there's usually a decent reason, so I'm kind of lacking on coping mechanisms for this particular phenomenon.  Yesterday, mood swings got even worse, and in a state of a whirlwind of very confused, conflicting, and volatile emotions, I found myself bumming three cigs from a coworker during my breaks.  I'm immediately back onto my quit(any thoughts on whether I should reset my badge?), but I'm afraid of losing control of things again.  Anyone else have experiences like this, and if so, how did you pull past them?

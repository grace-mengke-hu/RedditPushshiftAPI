I just watched that episode of How I Met Your Mother where the group all starts smoking cigarettes &amp; for the first time since my quit I finally didn’t crave while watching smokers on TV 🎉

TL;DR: 6 weeks in and I finally watched a tv show with people smoking heavily and didn’t feel the need to smoke and actually thought throughout the show that cigarettes aren’t as awesome as I once thought they were . If you’re new and you feel weak today , fight for one more day, and then another and then another, day by day , hour by hour like I did and eventually the seemingly impossible will happen where you’ll go days without feeling like you’d kill a drifter if it meant being able to have a drag of his smoke .🙃



For those who have never seen the show , It’s the episode where it’s revealed that one of the members of the friend group is a smoker (Robin)  .. throughout the episode the rest of the 5 friends start picking up smoking too and soon they’re all addicted and chain smoking together .

Today is 6 weeks since I’ve quit , and this is the first time I’ve been able to watch tv and not have a craving and it’s so far my biggest accomplishment as a quitter in my eyes . Just a week ago I was sad I couldn’t watch shameless anymore because they’re always smoking in that show and it was driving me crazy. 

In this episode of HIMYM they were smoking SO much and even talking about how great / relaxing it is to smoke .. Marshall was smoking with his boss and the boss said “ sharing a smoke with someone is a great bonding experience “ and hearing that last week probably would have made me really upset because not long ago I believed the same thing . They’d all inhale their cigarettes and say something like “ that’s the stuff “ like it was the most satisfying feeling in the world to be smoking and I still wasn’t phased !!! 

Later on in the episode Lily starts to develop a deep smokers voice , they all cough and complain of chest pains, they stand in the cold to smoke ,  and then they all decide to quit . Watching them wig out through withdrawals reminded me of how HARD that first week was and how I never want to go back to that place . Barney had his fingers in his mouth and someone asked if he was biting his nails and he said “no , I’m sucking any remaining nicotine out of my fingers “ and honestly that was relatable cause if that was even possible I probably would have done the same those first few days lol 

Anyways, the episode ends with them all deciding to have their last cigarette and not only did it feel good to finally not crave while watching them all smoke , it was a great reminder of how it’s actually not that awesome after all. I’m finally at a place I can look back and realize smoking didn’t do anything for me . I still get cravings , but they’re far and few between and when they do come they only last a few minutes and pass. 

This is my first real “holy shit I think I might actually pull this off” moment since quitting. I hope this inspires anyone new to quitting . Not long ago I was still convinced I was giving something up . I knew I wanted to quit but I couldn’t quite get my head around the idea that cigarettes did nothing for me . I definitely still miss it here and there , but for weeks I was so down on myself because I thought I was just unlucky in that I’d never stop craving . People talked so early on in their quit like “2 weeks in, hardly any cravings anymore “ and I’d be at week 4 wondering what was wrong with me that I was still craving. I never thought I’d see a day I’d watch smokers on tv drooling over cigarettes and not die inside wanting one. I know I still have a long way to go and more cravings will come but it feels nice to finally go days without feeling like I need to smoke .

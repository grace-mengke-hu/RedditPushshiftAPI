Day 100! Thank you Allen Carr!!!

One hundred days ago I was about a quarter way into reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking when I realized I had not smoked in nearly 24 hours, and that it would be interesting to see if I could keep saying 'no' to the thoughts of smoking.


By the time I finished the book I didn't even want to smoke the Final Cigarette, and this is the only instruction in his book I disregarded.


I can't recommend this book high enough, I have gifted out at least 5 copies so far, unfortunately no one is reading them :( It really is hard to leave an abusive relationship.


What's funny is everyone says they "aren't ready to quit" - well here is the thing - you will NEVER "be ready" to quit. You're not gonna wake up one day and be like "hm yes this next week is perfectly open and meets every mental scenario i have played out about smoking triggers, finally I can make my one attempt this year!" ... It doesn't work that way... but it CAN be easy.


The tipping point for me was that I'm not even 30, and every morning started with the same ritual of hocking up black tar that had collected my throat and spitting it out. I was talking to a friend about this, and the concept of 'Plot Armor' and how we don't have it as regular people. Somehow the conversation got too real for me, I was literally killing myself with each smoke.


Good luck everyone out there who is considering quitting =) 

If anyone wants any advice or anything, send me a PM!

Allen Carr's book should be promoted more in this sub!

[Update] I think I have mouth cancer. I am so scared and anxious

Hi guys, apparently my painless, hard ulcer is just my skull growing weirdly. It's a bone protrusion which I mistook for something cancerous. The doctor said just 6 years of smoking will not cause a malignancy. I am so relieved!  I am taking this chance to quit. Take heart guys. And thanks for the support!!!

I traded my ciggs for a vape 1 year ago yesterday. (results)

9 year smoker - decided I didn't want to make it a decade.  


Vaping truly worked. First, the benefits: I taste and smell everything, I can Breath and Run and make love again, I can vape inside so as not distracting myself from my work every 20 minutes, it's a LOT cheaper, I spend $50 a month on e-juice.  


How I did it. I use a 50-80watt coil, smoke it at 70 watts with 70%PG/30%VG juice with tobacco flavor. This mimics the throat hit and haul of a cigg the best I've found.  I started at 12mg nicotine and have reduced it to 1mg nicotine over the past year. I'm currently vaping 0mg nicotine for parts of the day.  


My plan is to switch completely to 0mg nicotine, and after a time - reduce the amount that I vape, and by New Years Day coming, I will be off of vaping.  


I took it slow, and let myself settle into each minor change for a long time. It's worked.  


Best of luck.

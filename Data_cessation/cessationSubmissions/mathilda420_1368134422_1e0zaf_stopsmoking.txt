FAO: Successful Quitters Who Suffer From Anxiety - Help Request!!

I use smoking as a crutch. Not as much as I used to, but it's the main reason I smoke. 

How did you fare when you quit? What did you use to replace smoking? Do you have any advice tailored towards a person who suffers from anxiety (albeit mildly) and really wants to give up?

I dont want to stop. But I have to. Help?

Hi! I (27F) am in a situation where I just dont know what to do. I have been a smoker for the past 13 years at least (maybe even more?); 2 weeks ago I found out that me and my fiance are having a baby and I am so so happy, I really cant believe that this magic has happened to us.. And I can not smoke anymore.. For the past 2 weeks, I have not had a cig! But it is so so difficult. 

Can you you guys give me some advice? How can I divide my day up without using smoke-breaks? Like what do I do with my time? How do I make the who non-smoker thing work in my benefit?

Now, because I am pregnant, I also can not use patches or nicotine gum or any of that, so please \*dont\* offer that as an option.. Also, I am constantly sick, so sports is also \*not\* an option.. 

HALP?

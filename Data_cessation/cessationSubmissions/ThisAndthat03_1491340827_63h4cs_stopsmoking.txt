A question for the long term quitters

When do you think you stopped associating smoking with the other things you enjoy in life? For example: I looked forward to warmer weather so I could sit outside, read a book while having a glass of wine (and smoking). Now that I'm not smoking, I'm worried that I wont enjoy sitting outside and reading anymore? I'm only 6 days into quitting, and for some reason this is really bothering me, like I wont enjoy anything anymore because I'm not smoking while I'm doing it. (I realize that's irrational, but I'm just feeling this way, haha)

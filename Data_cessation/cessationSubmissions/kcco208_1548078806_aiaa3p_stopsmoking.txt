Took a puff ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬

After 23 days of not smoking... I shared a cigarette with my husband.  Idk, I don't think it's the end of the world.  I still have the desire to smoke and the one yesterday... ugh man it was amazing.  I need to be stronger.  My reason for quitting is simple... I want to get pregnant.  I just need to be strong for that reason!!

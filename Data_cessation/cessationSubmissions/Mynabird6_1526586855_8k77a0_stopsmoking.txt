3 days in, but I am not doing well

I've picked a horrendous fight with my bf, who has for hours been refusing to speak to me or be in the same room as me because of it. 

It was after I provoked this reaction that I realized I was being terribly irritable largely because I'm not smoking, and now that damage is done. 

He and I have recently moved 1200 miles away from the few friends and family either of us had to begin with, so I don't have anywhere else to turn for support, and it's really hard doing this alone. 

I've spent most of the day panicking, pacing, sobbing, and just generally being frantic and frazzled. 

I also spent some time trying to resin hit his pipe with little success, then parachuted a gram of phenylethylamine and now I've been lying in bed for 4 hours.

Smoking messes with my head

I go through long periods smoke free and out of nowhere start smoking , it's the one or two will be ok and then I am addicted again trying to quit .

Everyone I start smoking again my head's a mess cortisol is up , I'm agitated and feel like I'm bouncing of the walls , then to curb the cravings I begin eating like shit and a cycle emerges that is difficult to break .

Usually I'm big into fitness and running so it's a major set back 

Does anyone else feel smoking makes them more for lack of a better word emotional/ agitated , stressed , tired

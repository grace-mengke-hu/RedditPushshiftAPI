Nicotine-free Herbal Cigarettes

Has anyone ever tried the nicotine free substitute cigarettes? What are your thoughts on them? Is it different from regular old smoking? 

I read about them online and picked up a pack of them today to try them. They're made of clove leaves rather than tobacco leaves, so there's no addiction.

That said, I'm not foolish enough to believe that these are in any way good for me or a healthy alternative. If I smoke them as much as I smoked regular cigarettes then I'd just be subbing one problem for another, but I like the fact that these don't have addiction potentials and thus can be taken or left depending on the situation at hand.

For me, I think that these will be useful because a lot of my friends and my clients (social work) are smokers and so smoking with them was always useful for bonding when I was a smoker. Since then, I've switched to a vape but the vape got old quickly because I couldn't ash it and just too much smoke came out, it was a different experience altogether. I think that keeping these around at strategic times might be beneficial, as long as I'm careful about not going crazy on them. To be honest, I think I may just end up getting bored of them like I did with the vape.

Anyway, has anyone had any experience with these? They're certainly not a good choice, but I think they're better than tobacco (and thus "good choice" is relative like that.)

Are they something to avoid? Given that they contain the same cancer risk and have tar in them despite not being addictive, is it equally undesirable to use these as it would be with a normal cigarette?

What do you guys think?

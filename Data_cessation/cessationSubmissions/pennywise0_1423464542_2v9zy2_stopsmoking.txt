37 days smoke free!

I am 37 days smoke free. The worst of it is over and I can finally resume my daily routines a bit easier. What has worked for me:

1.  Start exercising (more). It helps to have a noticeable improvement in your abilities as a nonsmoker.
2. Eat healthy foods and focus on what you're putting in your body.
3.  If you slip, and have a smoke, don't dwell on it. Acknowledge that you gave in but don't beat yourself up.
4. Stop drinking and hanging out around smokers for the first few weeks.
5. Drink water through a straw. It helped with my oral fixation and improved hydration. 

Good luck and best vibes to you all. Cheers.

Finally Got the Motivation To quiribt..

But I am dealing with absolutely horrible withdrawal symptoms, I have only been smoking 5 years but I literally feel like I am withering away. I can't eat throughout the day, I haven't slept in 3 days and my chest feels like its going to explode at times. Any other people ever feel like this? I went to my doctor and he said it was just a reaction to going cold turkey.

I made it! 1 year and counting!

I had to take a break from this sub for quite a long time. It was becoming every day was about me not smoking but I just wanted to forget about it. It's almost like the more I obsessed about quitting smoking the more it made me want to smoke. But this sub was so good for me in the very beginning and after I decided not to frequent here as much. I check in from time to time when I'm having a low and I see everyone who is just starting their journey or people who are checking in after five years of not smoking.

For the first couple months I was taking wellbutrin to help with the cravings. After I discovered the medication was affecting my sleep I stopped taking it but discovered I had just as much willpower without it. 

I didn't use any other form of nicotine. 

Over The last couple weeks I've been looking forward to this day when I could say I am one year quit and I've been thinking of ways to celebrate. There really isn't any way to celebrate other than post here to talk to you fine people!

This is a process and it takes every day. This is literally a mind over matter process. YOU are what's going to get you to stop smoking. You always have to have your head in the game and when you do you will win every day. At the end of every smoke-free day is a game that's won. You can't always be thinking "well what if I start smoking in a year or two down the line?" That doesn't matter. 

What matters is today and the choices you make today. But always remember the choices you make today can affect your tomorrow.

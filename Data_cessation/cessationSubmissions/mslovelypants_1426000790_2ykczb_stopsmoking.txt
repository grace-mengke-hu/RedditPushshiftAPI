I would love to read your success stories!

How has smoking has changed your life? It doesn't have to be a dramatic life change but reading those would be excellent too. I am a hiker and in the process of trying to get back into shape after quitting. With the warmer weather coming to the North, I plan to get out and climb higher and harder. I want to feel even more inspired by all of you. Thanks in advance!

1 week

I started vaping using a JUUL about 1 year ago to deal with the stress from my new job. The addiction creeped up on me and I didn’t notice I was addicted until sometime last spring. I told myself then that I would quit before summer was over. Shocker, I didn’t.

I let the status quo go on for months. I would tell myself “soon” and convince myself how much I hated it but then continue to vape nonstop when I was home or driving or whatever.

Well I finally said fuck it and just didn’t buy anymore new pods. Then, last Thursday I had just gotten out of the shower and my pod was basically empty. I looked at myself in the mirror and told myself this was it. I took the last few puffs and threw it in the trash and took the trash out.

Here I am a week later and the cravings are there but they generally subside quickly. Here’s to being free of nicotine.

Cheers.

1 month in clear I find myself also not wanting to smoke weed.

I smoked cigaretted and weed for 11 years. It's a tragedy but I feel like I ruined the joy of smoking weed because of the damage I did from cigarettes. It's not all bad, I eat edibles still every now and again. 

Anyone else feel this way after quitting cigarettes? Also I still drink every now and again. The liver is taking over for my lungs for now.

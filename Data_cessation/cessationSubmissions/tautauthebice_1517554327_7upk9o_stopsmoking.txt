Never thought id pass one year. I always knew there was a high chance of going back and there still is for a young man but

I have to say... its been fun. way more than smoking was. holy shit did the ash get everywhere. dry fingers. dry mouth. horrible tasting mouth. bad breath. bad smelling body in general. the taste of cigs... its not like its ice cream or anything. only tolerable because of the addiction. 

THE CASH SAVINGS.... noice. In summary. Being a non smoker is wayyyy better than smoking

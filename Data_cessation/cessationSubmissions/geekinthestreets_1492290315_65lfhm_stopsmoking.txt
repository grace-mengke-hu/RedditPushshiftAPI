6 months

Didn't post a 5 month update. Didn't feel the need to.

Now I've hit 6 months. Still no change from the 4 month update. I can be around cigarettes without consequence. I have no cravings. My weight did what it always does and yo yos by a few pounds. My anxiety is also yo yoing but it always does that. Now that the days are lighter I'm in a much better place (that reminds me, I need to check in at r/anxiety)

I hope all you guys are doing well wherever you're at in your quit.

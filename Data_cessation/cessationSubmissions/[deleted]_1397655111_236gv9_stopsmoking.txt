Bought a pack on day 245

Almost made it to 250! Damn.


I got some bad news from the vet and had a horrible work week. The urges kept calling and I just couldn't fight the good fight any longer. I tried to reason with it and tell myself the return to the habit wouldn't help my problems but I still caved. 


Not going to beat myself up about, just going to pick a new quit date and do it all over again. And honestly, going almost 250 days is something to be proud of, right?

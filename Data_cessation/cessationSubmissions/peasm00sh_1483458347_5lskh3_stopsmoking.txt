Coping mechanisms?

Hi everyone!

So I'm quitting for the fourth time (yep, I know) and I'm wondering what everyone uses to cope when the cravings get bad? I'm currently sucking mints and squeezing a stress ball, but I don't want to start vaping or anything like that as I don't want to switch addictions. I also can't start eating everything in sight due to a health condition - ugh.

fuck this.

I've been alive less time than some of you have been smokers. I was a social smoker for the past couple of years, a fag or two with a drink, and for the past 4 months I've upped my intake since getting a new job. Going for smoke breaks with mates, socialising like that, chatting shit while smoking.

I'm just done with it. My whole work day started revolving around when I'll next be able to go for a cigarette or two. I wanna stop it before it takes over my whole life. It's already gone out of control.

Why the fuck do I go to therapy every week if I use cigarettes every time I'm stressed anyway?

Why the fuck do I do an elaborate skincare routine every morning and evening if I'm going to destroy my skin with cigarettes?

Why the fuck do I bother spending money on perfume if I end up stinking like an ashtray at the end of the day anyway?

I smoked my last cigarette on Friday morning. Read that Allen Carr book as well. Shoved all my lighters into one drawer.

I don't want to bother smoking anymore. I don't need it to cope. I shouldn't have started in the first place, but now I can't do anything but stop. 

Fuck this.

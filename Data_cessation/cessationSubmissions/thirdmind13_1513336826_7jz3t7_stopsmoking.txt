I smoke too much

I am heavily addicted to cigarettes (2 packs a day). I've been smoking like that for about 3 years now and have been a pack a day smoker for 7 years. I quit drinking and drugging and now I'm smoking heavier than ever some nights 3-4 packs... I think I'm going to die from it I can't even breathe anymore. How do I stop? Does anybody know? Has anybody quit smoking? Not like death is the worst thing but I'd rather it be fast than develop a debilitating illness that takes years to kill me. I am 23 years old btw.

I'm giving up the (smoking) ghost

Today is the day. I actually quit about an hour ago but today (Aug 26) is my official quit date that I set. I'm actually excited about this. It feels like I'm doing something really good for myself.

I'm going to stock up on gum and candy and flush that nicotine out ASAP. Already loading the Allen Carr audiobook on my phone for work. Look forward to using this subreddit to help me get through this.

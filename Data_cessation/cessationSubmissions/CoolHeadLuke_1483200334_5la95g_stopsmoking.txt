How cliche, I'm quitting on New Years. I must be Brave, or at least stubborn/ and angry enough to quit.

So, it is with a bit of anxiety and fear that I write this. After 18 years of smoking, and about a dozen failed attempts, I am endeavoring again to quit. Ive started allan carrs book a few times, and end up putting it down to go outside to smoke. I went through long periods of sobriety, five year run being the longest, but the longest Ive gone without smoking is 40 days, I did do that 3 times. I'm 35 years old(m), and I am starting to feel the effects of age and vices. Im currently in Germany on Vacation with the wife, we live in Texas. Im at a nice place surrounded by non-smokings, and yet Im going outside constantly, into the cold to smoke. I know I reek of marlboros, and her family who are non smokers have been kind and havent complained, but I feel guilty, and weak. Ive felt like a failure over this time and again. I continue to face this, and will be bold enough to face the mind fucks again. 2017 is a new year, Im about 7 hours away local time from midnight. I have until then to smoke to my content, then I am waterboarding the rest of the ciggs left, and bolding walking forward as an ex/nonsmoker. Thanks for reading, I love you all.

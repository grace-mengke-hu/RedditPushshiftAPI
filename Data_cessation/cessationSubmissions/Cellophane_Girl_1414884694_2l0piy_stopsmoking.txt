You guys are inspiring.

I've been lurking here because I want to quit smoking. I have two cigarettes left that I will smoke tonight and tomorrow will be my quitting day. I tried to quit last week but only went 3 days and then the withdrawal symptoms got so bad that I just couldn't last. 
But reading all the stories and tips here has made me realize that I CAN do it and I WILL do it. 

Tomorrow is my day and I will be using you guys for support. Even if I may not post much I'll be here reading stories and knowing I'm not alone in this. 

Thank you all.

On my fourth day without a cigarette, craving bad...

I'm 18, but sad to say I've been smoking since I were 14.  Of course not as heavily as I do now (before 4 days ago). Since I've turned 17 I began smoking at least a pack a day and haven't stopped up until this past Monday. I quit cold turkey, no alternatives. Just told myself one more and haven't touched one since...now I'm feeling that same sort of thing again... Where I'm telling myself "one more".. I asked a close friend and to my surprise he suggested I'd smoke half a cig and short it out. I'm not sure what to do, can't sleep, and have terrible cravings. I almost feel as if the only motivation I have are the people around me, in which I don't want to disappoint. I need advice what should I do to quit for good, or is smoking in moderation as unhealthy as a pack a day?

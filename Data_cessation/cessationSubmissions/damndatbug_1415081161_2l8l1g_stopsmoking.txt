I am doing it again.

hello again guys. After my brutal relapse and the rage that came with it, I've mustered the courage to try again. I am not giving up. I repeat, I am not giving up. I will keep looking here for motivation and determination, and I want you to know your words of encouragement on my first post were much appreciated. Thank you again. Welp, wish me luck!

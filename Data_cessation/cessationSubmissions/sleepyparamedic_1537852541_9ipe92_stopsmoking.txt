Brain fog gone when I am not smoking?

In my recent attempts of quitting and switching to vape (~1mg) I noticed that I am much active in conversation and better at talking with other people.

Has anyone else experienced this and do you know the science behind?

Ps. I did google it, but there isnâ€™t much information on it.

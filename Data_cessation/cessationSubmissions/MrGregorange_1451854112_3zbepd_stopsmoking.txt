This time I will win

So there it comes again, the great day, tomorrow I will stop smoking again, tomorrow because I had few today and it gave me nothing apart of loss of energy and bad smell. I think I am hard case when it comes to quitting smoking. It is my obsession since 8 years, yes within last 8 years I've managed to quit even for 12 months once.And than back to square one. Every time I started smoking again was caused by event which I used as excuse, like stress, pressure, sensation of escape to little filthy stinky zone of smoke and nicotine.

I came across this forum thanks to smoke free app and after reading few posts I realized this is great, and another possible solution.

I tried cold turkey, gums, Alen Carr's easy way and looking back I realized what my problem really is. It is not quitting I need, I need to find the way to stop lighting this only one cigarette which makes me go back to the start.
I focused too much on making effort on quitting itself, I've done it so many times it doesn't really mean anything.
The biggest thing that pisses me off the most is that I have no problem stopping for 2 or 3 days, The problem is this one single sensation of craving comes very strong and if I'm not occupied I loose against cigarette.

Anyway good to be here, makes me feel like I'm not the only one. All the best to all of you out there with the same problem.

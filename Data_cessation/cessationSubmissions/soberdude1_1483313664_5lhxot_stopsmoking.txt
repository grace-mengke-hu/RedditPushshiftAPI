Miracle

Today makes 1501 days, totally cigarette and nicotine free. What a great way to celebrate the new year. I smoked a pack and a half a day for 40 years, tried and failed to quit thousands of times. Finally did it with the assistance of Allen Carr's book.

To all you New Years day quitters and any one trying to quit, never stop trying. You won't die from a craving, even though your brain is telling you, you will. Keep on quitting.

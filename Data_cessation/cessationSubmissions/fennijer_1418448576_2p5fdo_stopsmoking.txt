Tomorrow is the first big test.....And I'm a bit scared.

I'm at just over 2 months and I've been hiding out from the smoking world. Tomorrow we have friends coming over to stay and they smoke. 

Not so much worried about me but the hubby quit with me but is still on the lozenges. He depends on them at times still. I'm paranoid he'll decide to have one.

I already know I would be super pissed of he did. In all the times we've quit together, and he admits this, he's always the one to start buying again.

I'm strong but I don't want to be tested as to how strong I can be.

Any advice?

And yes... We HAVE spoken about my fears. But when he tells me he won't smoke he seems nervous and unsure. And come Christmas, we will surrounded by smokers.

This the season for insanity!

FA LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA!!

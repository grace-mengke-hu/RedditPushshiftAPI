Replacement for thought tool?

I have not smoked for quite some time. However, even a year or so later, I am still drawn to smoke a cigarette, or even more so my tobacco pipe, as a means to think for ten-thirty minutes. It was a GREAT tool for me to simply ponder over something I have read (I study a lot) in between chapters and such. I know I'm not alone in this, so I was wondering among quitters, what would be a good replacement for this?   
Some things I have tried:  
Running - Running works a little, and is probably still my favorite option.... but it's not something you can do as much as you can smoke. Especially since I work 8-12 hour shifts, four days a week. I've thought about getting a treadmill so that way I could just hop on for ten minutes and they hop back into studying for another thirty, etc.   
Vaping - This worked out except for the fact that I don't want to be dependent on nicotine at all. 
Light gaming - usually turns into heavy gaming. and procrastination.  

I'm really looking for any type of healthy, 5-10 minute habit I can use purely for reflecting on my own thoughts. This was what I primarily used smoking for in the last few years and so far nothing seems to compare to it.

NRT'S or COLD TURKEY?!

Hello reddit I've been trying to quit for a good long while now, but every time something bad in my life happens I find myself puffing on that bad habit again. My will power goes out the window.. I've tried vaping nicorette chewing gum and going cold turkey.. I'm not a fan of the patches..  the reason I want to quit is because I've lost so much weight (also due to depression and mental health) but would love to gain the weight back again and know that quitting smoking would be a step in the right direction. I have failed so many times to stop    but I'm determined to make this year 2019  the year that I want to quit and be healthy again.

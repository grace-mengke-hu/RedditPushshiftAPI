Threw away my cigarettes tonight

I just threw away my cigarettes tonight after putting it off for quite a while. I was always worried that I wouldn't be able to overcome the first few days, but fuck it, I won't know if I don't try, right?

I've tried quitting before only to give up and tell myself it's too difficult and not necessary at that time. This time I've had these weird headaches that I assume are coming from cigarettes and I've always told myself I'd quit if I noticed any negative effects of smoking. 

The last few days have been weird because I've only smoked out of a feeling of necessity and always only smoked half when I went out for one. I hope I've somewhat "weaned" myself off. 

I've had the Smoke Free app on my phone for the past few years, and I just reset the date today, so I think that will keep me motivated somewhat. Do you guys have any tips for me for the first few days? I feel like before I would go without smoking for a day or so and then just get it in my head that I *had* to buy a pack and would enter this daze where I wouldn't come out of it until I had the pack. So I guess I'm mostly worried about that. Any tips would help. 

My girlfriend is also wondering how she can help and what she can say to me if I want to buy cigs. Any tips for her? I told her to just remind me of the reasons I want to quit. I tried to explain to her my reasons the best I could, but any insight you guys have would help as well. 

Thank you guys in advance :) I've also read stories of quitters in the past and those have kept reminding me that I wanted to quit, so thank you to those people that post here. It has helped. 

Cheers, and I'll post again soon.

Hi Everyone! Hope you're all well and wondering if any could be kind enough to provide some inspiration?

Hi all,

Been lurking this subreddit over the last two weeks as I've been attempting to quit and so far have found it a lot of use. So many strong minded and caring people here who I know have the resolution to quit smoking!

I was doing well and was off cigarettes for nearly ten days, coming from 20 cigs a day, however yesterday evening I broke and ended up running and buying a packet and smoking three. I guess I should add I have been vaping with nicotine as personally it has been helping in regards to the ritual of smoking, though if anyone can quit without I have a lot of respect for them!

I threw away the pack I bought this morning and am adamant I want to continue giving up, I just find myself constantly struggling and debating going and getting some more. I really don't want this to happen, I mean, if not now why would I quit in a week or a month or whenever? I want to stop smoking now.

I just have a very impulsive personality and so was wondering if anyone could offer some tips and further incentives for giving cigarettes the 'F*ck you' for a final time?

Thanks so much,

Stay well and positive guys! <3

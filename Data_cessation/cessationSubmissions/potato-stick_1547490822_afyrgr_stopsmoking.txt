Day 21- woke up with every part of my body screaming for a cigarette. Resisted. Resisting.

I was doing just fine. In fact my first couple of days after quitting were absolutely fine. In retrospect I think my body had so much nicotine it was enough to sustain my body for at least two more days after quitting lol. Then cravings started to come and go. High tides of cravings, then low tides. Ebbs and flows. But boy did I wake up to a giant wave today! 

Did my first office meeting from home. As soon as I finished it, my first instinct was to get up and go smoke with my first coffee of the day at my (then) regular spot in the alley. And I voluntarily had to remind myself that I don’t smoke anymore, I don’t own cigarettes and lighters. But once it awoke, my craving refused to subside. I panicked. The store’s only a block away, I thought.

I then remembered that I had once bought a whole box of these horrible fake mint cigarettes off Amazon and they were so bad that I threw all save one pack away. I scrambled around my drawers, found it stuffed away in one corner. And for the first time in 21 days today, I repeated my ritual of smoking in the alley with my cup of coffee. Rituals are powerful. I’m glad I didn’t get my wallet down with me because I believe I faced my weakest moment in all these 3 weeks today. I thought of going to the store, buying a pack, give it to my buddy at the counter, and just take one cigarette. But then what, I thought... just one cigarette is enough to kill everything that I’ve worked so hard for. I never want to go down that alley with a coffee in my hand again. 

My brain is unable to function, I have meeting, deadlines and submissions. This is tough. But I want to get through this.

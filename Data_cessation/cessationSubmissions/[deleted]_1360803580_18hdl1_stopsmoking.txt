After seven long years I am 18 hours and 37 minutes smoke free! 

Finally posting today because I'm having a hard time over here, damn! I'm proud of myself and feel pretty lovely breathing wise but I am sweating my ass off and feel so light headed. 

I have one cigarette tucked away. I feel pissed off at myself for not smoking it but I know I will be *really* pissed off at myself if I cave in. 

Doing this shit cold turkey, FUCK YOUUU NICOTINE!

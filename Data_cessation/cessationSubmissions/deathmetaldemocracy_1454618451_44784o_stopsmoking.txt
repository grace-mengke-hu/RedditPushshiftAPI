Starting the cycle over again....

I've tried to quit so many times, the first time I quit about 2 years ago I succeeded about 3 months. Second time around I lasted 3 weeks, and the third time I lasted just 5 days. I'm tired of letting this addiction overpower me, having a shitty budget because of it and offending people by smelling like an ashtray 24/7. Over all I just hope I can find the strength to say "no" to my addiction for good.

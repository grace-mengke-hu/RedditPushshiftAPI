Rationalizing a Relapse

This last weekend I was at my mom's house. She took my kids for a walk and I was alone for about 30 minutes.  With a pack of cigarettes.  I didn't smoke that day.  And I haven't smoked since but I've found myself starting to mentally rationalize a relapse.  This has always been the beginning of the end for me.  The mental acrobatics.  

I talked to my husband about it, the idea that nobody would know except for me if I had "just one" and he reminded me that this quit is for me, not for anyone else and if I fall off the wagon, I'm to blame and I'm only accountable to myself.  I know, deep down, that I can't change my smoking habits.  I've quit before because I got up to 2 packs a day.  I would quit for several months and then come back to it with the idea that I could smoke, "just a few."  And of course I would always work my way back up to 2 packs a day.  Lately I've been thinking about, "well, what if I just smoke 5 a day?" or "what if I just smoke when I'm drinking?" or "what if I don't smoke in the van or if I hide it from the kids?"  

I'm not going to relapse tomorrow.  I'm currently pregnant and I refuse to smoke while pregnant.  But I feel like being alone with those cigarettes has set something off and now I'm trying to rationalize relapse in 10 weeks when this baby is born.  Like I deserve a cigarette for all the cigarettes I haven't smoked.  How stupid is that?

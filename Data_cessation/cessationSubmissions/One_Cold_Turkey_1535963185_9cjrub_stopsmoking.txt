What about erections?

I've been lurking this sub, have not yet stopped smoking. I wrote to ask about your experience with lost of erection, at least partially which is equally bothering. I smoke menthol, have read for years all those warnings. 

I'm +40, male, 160pounds, skinny. I do not exercise at all. 

I'm hopping for stories about erection improvement after quitting smoking. Not sure it is a long shot.

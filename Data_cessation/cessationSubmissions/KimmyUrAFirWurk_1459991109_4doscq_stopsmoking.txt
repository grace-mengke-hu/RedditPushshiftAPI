[Kinda unrelated] Doing a project on drugs for school, does the US make or lose money from Tobacco?

I've read the US makes 15.5 Billion annually from Tobacco sales but that over 170 billion is lost annually due to taking care of tobacco related illnesses, and cancer. So is there something I am missing or does the US government lose money from smoking?

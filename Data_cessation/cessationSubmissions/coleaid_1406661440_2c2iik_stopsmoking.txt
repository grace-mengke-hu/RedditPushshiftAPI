Today is Day 1

It's a few days from my 26th birthday. Need a birthday present for myself.


So I'm gonna get a new mantra: "I don't need a cigarette today."


I just hope all of my friends will be supportive.


I haven't really tried to quit before. Been smoking for about 3-4 years, and I figured I should quit while I'm still ahead.


I do not need a cigarette today. One day at a time. Just have to keep reminding myself that.


Right?

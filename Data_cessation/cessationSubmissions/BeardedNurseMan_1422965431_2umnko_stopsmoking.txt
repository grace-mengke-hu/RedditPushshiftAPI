Girlfriend broke up with me...

So its been almost two months since I stopped using tobacco and in that time I was lucky enough to find a beautiful human being who I was able to spend 1 month of my life with. She broke up with me last night and I was absolutely crushed. I didnt use any chew or snus and I learned to find the light in a dark situation. It has been a long time since I formed a bond like I did and I think its because I have opened up without my vices. I also think that being able to hurt this bad is a sign of how much I am able to open up as a human being. I know this may sound very trivial but for me it was huge. I have seen so many amazing aspects of not chewing and I wouldnt say I am excited to be hurt again, but knowing that I am capable of caring about someone else is new and exciting for me. 

Edit: This is not to tell you about how I want to chew again, I absolutely do not and will not. This is just my reflection on how much I have grown as a person without chew in my life. I hope it inspires some of you to keep trucking and live the life you want.

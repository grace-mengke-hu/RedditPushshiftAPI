49 days, gave in with boyfriend

Boyfriend and I are trying to quit together. He was a couple weeks good then something really stressful happened yesterday. So, he had one while I was there. Because I decided I was wanting one and we were doing it together, I had one from the pack he never threw away. Had another later. We are trying to be strong though, I told him after the first cigarette that it wasn't just his fault that I had a cigarette and he failed too, that it was partly mine too. Then last night we were talking on the phone while I was having nicfits, and he told me not to worry and we're doing this together. It meant a lot to me :).

This morning, I'm not having really any desire to smoke, so thats good. I'm Buddhist, so I'll likely be meditating a little more than usual. Telling me not to worry last night was the right thing to say because that's something I struggle with and is one of the bigger things in Buddhism and meditation. Tonight I spend the night at my boyfriend's, so that's good as I won't be doing nothing.

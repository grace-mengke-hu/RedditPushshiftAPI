4 days. Found my packet while cleaning.

107 hours and 28 minutes from my last cigarette (but who's counting), and I found my half empty packet in my room. 

I'm really tempted to have one, even just to see how sick the Champix makes me, but that just puts me down to 0 hours again. 

In the bin you go, guys.

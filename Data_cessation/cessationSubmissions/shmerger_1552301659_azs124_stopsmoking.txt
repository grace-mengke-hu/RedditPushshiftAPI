how smoking has made you feel/ before and after

hey guys so a year and five months ago, a friend of mine gave me a juul. I didnt have a problem with smoking, I smoked cigs MAYBE one or two but not frequently. I could go days/weeks without it and would smoke just when I felt like it. Now a year later, (fuck the friend who gave me a juul when I wasnt addicted), I hit the juul so much. I use a suorin too when I feel too cheap to buy juul pods. But this is ridiculous. I hit it so much, with juul pods I go one and a half days for one pod. While this isn't the worst damn story and people smoke way more, it's racking up. It's worse than a lot of people and I dont want it to get any more out of hand. I didn't even have an addiction to begin with and now i'm part of the stupid usb stereotype.

SO. How nicotine I feel like has been affecting me. I wake up and its the first thing I want to do. If I marked tallies on how much I hit it a day It'd probably shock me. I can't go more than 3 or so hours without wanting to hit it, get away from stress. I desperately want to clean my room but I just cant. I feel fucking lazy. I feel depressed, and I honestly want to link smoking to depression. Why are you smoking if theres not something youre trying to get away from. yada yada. I know I CAN quit but it's just a matter of when. Like I could easily tell myself I dont need to quit but I know that I do.

I watched people on youtube talking about why they quit smoking and a lot of it was just dependence, laziness, hindering yourself and stuff like that.

BOTTOM LINE QUESTION: How did smoking affect you as a person when you did smoke. How does it currently affect you if you do smoking? How has your life improved since quitting the habit? I want to know how it affects/affected you. How quitting will make life better. Is it me or is it the nicotine.

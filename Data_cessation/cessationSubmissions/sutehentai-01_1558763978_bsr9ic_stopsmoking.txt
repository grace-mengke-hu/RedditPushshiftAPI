Methods That Helped You Quit

I'm 22 and I've been smoking 8 years now. I feel like at least twice a year I think and try to quit smoking but end up failing after a week. Just curious as to what helped others quit and keep staying smoke free to this day.

The past couple of days waking up my lungs hurt even worse than usual. Tired of waking up everyday and not being able to breath so the time to quit feels like now more than ever.

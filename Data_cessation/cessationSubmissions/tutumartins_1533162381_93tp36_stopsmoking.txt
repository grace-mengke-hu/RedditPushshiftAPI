Brain fog, blurred memory.

I’m 26, been a smoker for ten years, mostly a pack/day. It’s my second attempt to quit and I’m experiencing terrible brain fog (day 3, cold turkey). I’m also a student and my memory it’s kind of blurry. Can’t remember important facts related to my field right now... really important facts. I’m almost back to smoking if it is to have my  working brain back. Any thoughts? :(

No excuses

(X-post with r/leaves)
I quit 5 days ago (shit! Is that all?!?!) it feels like it was much longer ago than that... it’s been a long old 5 days. No nicotine, no weed, no smoking anything at all. It’s been bloody hard but I’ve found from previous experience that tapering doesn’t work for me, and using nicotine replacement just stopped me sleeping for weeks!

In the past I’ve used stressful life events (arguments with SO, problems with kids, job etc) as an excuse to light up again. But I’m not doing that again. I’m sick of hating myself for being weak, unmotivated, and stupid for going back to smoking. 

So despite the fact that I lost my job this week, my dad collapsed due to heart issues and was taken to hospital and my dear father-in-law has just got a terminal cancer diagnosis I AM NOT GOING TO SMOKE! 

I promised my daughter I’d never smoke again. I promised myself that I’d start taking better care of myself so that I can take better care of her and my son, and I promised my husband that I’d never put him through my quitting hell again - this is the last time. I intend to keep those promises. 

It’s been really hard, it’s been emotional and sometimes it feels like life will never be ‘normal’ again, but I’m done with making excuses. I’m done with smoking. 

Hang in there guys! We got this!

TL;DR: shit happens. Still not gonna smoke. We can do this!

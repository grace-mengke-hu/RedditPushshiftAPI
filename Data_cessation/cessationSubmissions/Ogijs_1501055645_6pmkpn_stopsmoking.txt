One day has passed and feeling lightheaded

Hello,

I smoked my last one yesterday, it's been 20hours since my last smoke after 6-7 years of 10-15 a day. I read Alen Carr's easyway, and since then i haven't experienced any cravings. But there is one thing - i'm feeling a little lightheaded almost as if I was breathing rapidly even when i don't, and some kinda pressure on my ears from inside. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I be worried?

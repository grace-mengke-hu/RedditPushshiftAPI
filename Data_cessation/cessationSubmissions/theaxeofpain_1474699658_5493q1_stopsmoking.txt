I made it to 1 week!

Hello reddit, how's your smoke-free life going? 

Today is my first week of quitting and it has been great so far. I can breathe better, I can smell and taste better, and I smell better as well. I haven't had any real cravings even though I have been drinking 2-3 beers each day (sometimes more).

It hasn't been as hard as some people for me though. I haven't had any physical withdrawal symptoms and have been feeling healthier each day. 

I had a few drags on Tuesday though but I didn't really like it. I was craving it but immediately left the bar when I thought about smoking 'just one'. My only concern is that tonight I'm invited to a birthday party, at the same bar, where after 11 smoking is allowed and literally everybody smokes. I've told my best friend that if I crave a smoke he has to forbid me and we'll get out to get some fresh air.

Just wanted to share a few of my milestones so far. Stay smoke free guys!

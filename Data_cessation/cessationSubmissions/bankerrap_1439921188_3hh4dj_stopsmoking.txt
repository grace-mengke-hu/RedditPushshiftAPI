Feeling sick but glad to be smoke free

Today I woke up coughing up loads of crap and ended up feeling really groggy all day. I slept for 3 hours in the middle of the afternoon. So glad most of my cravings have subsided and I can just be sick without also feeling anxious about smoking.

Being sick without smoking is so much better than being sick as a smoker. 

Also share your achievements to cheer me up! 

Day 9 and its going even better than I thought (despite the sick thing).

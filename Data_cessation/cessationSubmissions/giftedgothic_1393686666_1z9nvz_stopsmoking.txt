One day, eighteen hours, four minutes.

That's how long I've been smoke free! Decided on the 27th that I no longer wanted to have this control my lifestyle. I never realized how much I was a slave to nicotine until I've been interviewing for grad school. Between airports and restaurants and overall stress, I felt panicked if I couldn't escape for a cig. Sitting in one of those horrendous smoking lounges at the Denver Airport, I thought to myself, "Why the hell are you doing this?" 

Truth is, I'm a nonsmoker. I'm a nonsmoker who went through a phase of experimental smoking that I'm now over and ready to go back to my nonsmoking life. 

Nicotine makes me feel like shit! I have no idea why I'm addicted. I get stomach aches, extreme tiredness, irritability, etc. So as much as my brain wants one, I know I'll just feel worse after.

I'm hoping this subreddit can give me the motivation I need to continue forth.

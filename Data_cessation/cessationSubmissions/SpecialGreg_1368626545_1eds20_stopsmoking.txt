For roughly a year now I've been smoking 2-4 a day, I know its not a lot but how can I stop before it gets worse?

I feel a little silly asking for help when I know people smoke 20 a day and a handful must seem so small.. But I can't stop my routine and when I drink I find myself smoking much more.

My routine is usually a smoke when I wake up and another after my main meal, some days (usually when I am bored) I smoke another couple.

One Year Down.

Hey guys long time no see. I had unsubbed awhile back because honestly seeing this subreddit at the top just reminded me that I was quitting smoking. A whole friggin year, I can't believe it. It feels like forever but at the same time I can't believe how fast it seems to have gone by. 

Good luck everyone, hopefully this time next year you'll all have 365 days added to your flair :D

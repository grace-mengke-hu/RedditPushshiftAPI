1 down, more to go...

I have officially made it one year without cigarettes.  A *big* thank you to  the members of this sub during the first few months when it was the absolute hardest.

If I have to give any tips that helped me:  

* drink lots of water

* stay positive

* do some form of exercise to help emphasize the need of healthy lungs and show you the damage you've done to them

* resist the urge to drink for the first few months

* stay positive (!!)

* post on here and talk to friends/family when you need to take your mind off things

* pick up a hobby

* watch new TV shows (Netflix is awesome)

* find something to keep you busy

* *stay* positive (!!!)

Good luck to all of you who just began this journey.  The road is not easy off the bat, but it gets easy.  Seriously.

I've been smoking since I was 17, I'm now 23 and decided I want to quit. Help?

I started smoking when I was 17 because I wanted to be "cool." Big mistake. After high school I joined the military and smoking became the norm due to the fact our mos is stressful due to deadlines and straight bullshit. There's a smoke pit right behind my work center and sadly a lot of the people I hang out with are smokers and or dippers. I'm tired of wasting my money of smokes and smelling like an ash tray and I'm working on being more healthy and happy. I just started taking a stop-smoking aid called Chantix. Makes me feel nauseous and the dreams I get at night are horrible! But I'm gonna stick with it because I want to be smoke free. I'm back on the dating scene as well and I know many guys find smoking not attractive. What I was hoping to get from you guys is any tips or experiences you have that can help me and or motivate me.

Let's create a list/FAQ to help all the newcomers for the new year

I know I'm only 4 days in and would love to have people who are more long term quitters to endorse and contribute to this but I think we should create a list of helpful tips and tricks that people to help people during the first few days (maybe even put in the sidebar?). 

Maybe even some information on what to expect, common ideas, thought processes, getting over triggers, how to get through social situations....

Here is what has helped me get through cravings:

1. Drink water
2. Smile as hard as I can and firmly say/think "I do not want this cigarrette" (This helped me tremendously)
3. Deep breathing/Fresh Air

If everyone justs comments, their opinions, I'll go through and organize everything into a readable format.

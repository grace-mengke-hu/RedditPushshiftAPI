Day 1 - made it :)

After 35 years, I quit smoking yesterday. With the support of my family and friends I made it 24 hrs for the first time ever. 

I’ll continue to take it one day at a time. A moment at a time (hanging on by a thread) when necessary. 

Bottom line - I don’t smoke anymore, no matter what. :)

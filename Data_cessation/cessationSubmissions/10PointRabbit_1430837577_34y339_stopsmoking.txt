Day 7 and things are getting tough

I've been "off" since the 27th of April.  I had been smoking about 20 per day for the last 5-6 years. The first week was surprisingly easier than I anticipated.  No slip ups, and a simple jog in the morning would help keep cravings away for the better part of the workday.  Now, it is just non-stop craving.  I run, and with every step I take I need one.  

I slipped up yesterday (had 3) because I was having a terrible day.  Stressful workday, car accident, girl problems; I guess when it rains it pours.  I'm not looking for someone to tell me it gets easier or that it wont be hard, but any sort of advice for how to break the cravings or deal with them would be much appreciated.  I'm not opposed to NRT, but don't want to find myself replacing smoking with another thing I'll have to quit someday.

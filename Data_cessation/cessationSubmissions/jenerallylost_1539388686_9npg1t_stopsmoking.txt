Day 10. My teeth are visibly whiter!!! Iâ€™m halfway to a toothpaste commercial! ðŸ˜‚

I can hardly pull myself away from the mirror. Iâ€™d read that your teeth get whiter after you stop but I didnâ€™t believe it!

I still have 5-15 minutes a few times a day of intense anger and pure hatred for smokers who get to smoke when Iâ€™m not allowing myself to. My sleep has gone to shit too, but thereâ€™s a lot of bad going on in life right now so itâ€™s not just the quit impacting my sleep. 

I didnâ€™t really believe Iâ€™d get this far. But my teeth are whiter now and I canâ€™t give that up. 

Iâ€™ve got this. (And you do too.)

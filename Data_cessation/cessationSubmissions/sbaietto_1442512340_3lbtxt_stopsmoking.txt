Making a plan to quit. Asking for advice.

I have read up on tips for quitting smoking what I read was that you should have a plan, like have a quit date and quit in the future. I also read that you should quit first thing in the morning. Since I've already smoked two today; today would not be a good day to quit. Another problem I have is that my husband smokes. I am currently suffering from some mild insomnia as well and worry about the side effects and withdrawal of quitting. Can you guys give me any advice or tips and a little bit of advice on what to expect? I also have anxiety and I fear that will get worse as well. I'm 34 years old and have been smoking since I was about 15 or 16 years old currently smoking about 15 cigarettes a day. I have done some things to change some of the habits that are triggers for me. For example, Facebook - I deactivated my account because I would like to veg out on Facebook and smoke. Thanks in advance.

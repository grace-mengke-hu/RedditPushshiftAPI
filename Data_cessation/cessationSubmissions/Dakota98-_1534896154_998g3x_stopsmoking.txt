Quit before, started again because my old job stressed me out.

I worked as a main cook for a popular restaurant. The pay was great, but greatly overworked in sometimes ridiculous or stressful situations. I quit before, but I haven’t really smoked then. After a particularly stressful day I caved in and bought a pack. And since then I’m smoking more cigarettes than I’ve ever have before, and I can’t seem to get myself to stop. I even found a better job where I’m actually happy and I can’t kick this horrible habit. Are there any tips and tricks?

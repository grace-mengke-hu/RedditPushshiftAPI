New member celebrating 24 hours smoke-free

Hi, my name is Alex, 37/F. I'm a longtime lurker and this is my first post. I've been smoking since I was 16 (I'm 37 now). Over the past 2 years, I've tried to quit many times, to the point where I was basically either just quit or just relapsed, all the time. I could usually get to about a week of being smoke-free before trying "just one", then it would be all over for a month, then repeat. Exhausting, and I hated myself. 

Smoking causes me constant anxiety. I have health problems I won't get too much into here (cervical dysplasia and infertility) that are not helped at all -- if not directly caused by -- cigarettes. The shame I feel over doing this to myself is at times unbearable. I have no idea if I can reverse the damage I've done to my body, but I really don't want to have an active part in making it worse.

This is my latest attempt to stay smoke-free. I don't have much faith in myself but I have to keep trying. I am using the patch, and right now I am 24 hours smoke-free.

I'm hoping posting here for social support will help. It's the one thing I haven't tried. If anyone has any words of advice or support, I'd appreciate it!

Here I go! Question to those who have been successful.

I've been lurking for a short time while contemplating quitting. I finally decided today is the day. My question is... have any heavy smokers been successful on this forum? I'm talking 1 pack or more a day. By now i'd be on my 4th-5th cigarette and I just have a uneasy feeling. Not anxiety as much as missing something. Last cigarette I had was last night so it's well over 12 hours.

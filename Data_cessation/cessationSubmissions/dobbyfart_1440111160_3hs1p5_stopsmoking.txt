I was checking on my badge number and saw 200 days!

I like to check in here once in a while. I stopped after a bit because while I am over almost all of my triggers, reading about other people's is difficult for me. However, I remember the first month or two were really hard and it was so encouraging to see people posting on here with a big number. 

When I was really smoking I was smoking a pack and a half a day. I did that for about four years. There were days where I'd only smoke like 4 cigarettes and there were days where I'd tear through two packs. Then I had a surprise pregnancy and had to stop ^^doing ^^everything smoking. 

Once I had the baby I still couldn't smoke because I was breastfeeding, and it just wasn't part of the routine of having a baby. But then I was involved in a long, drawn-out custody battle and the stress convinced me one cigarette once in a while, only when I was really stressed wouldn't hurt everything. And blammo, three months later I was up to a pack a week, or a half a pack a day if it was a really bad day.

I quit again for three months and then I was smoking again. Only about two cigarettes a day, but smoking is smoking. It's bad for you. It makes you stink. It makes you more irritable than you think it does. Your mom (if she's anything like mine) worries about you and makes you feel guilty about it. You have to constantly have some kind of mint or scented lotion. There's pretty much no winning when you're smoking other than feeding an addiction and that's not really a win, is it?

Anyway, I just wanted to check in with everyone here. If you're just starting this is an amazing sub. The people here are very supportive and it's encouraging to talk to people who are struggling with the same thing.

I wish you all the best! You can do this!

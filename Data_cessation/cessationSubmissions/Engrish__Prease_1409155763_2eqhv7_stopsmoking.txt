Never tried to quit but 3 days in, I'm feeling awesome!

I'm overcoming an 18 year addiction to cigarettes. My doctor has been harping on me to quit for years. I found that the health concerns alone did not motivate me to quit. :|

I really "enjoyed" smoking...or so I thought. I just viewed it as a stress reliever along with pot. 

So what motivated me to kick the habit finally? I think I may have met my soul mate recently. :) For me it's a no brainer, would I rather have a cigarette or not stink all the time and be able to kiss my GF any time? :)

Anyways, I haven't watched all of "the video" yet. I watched like the first 20 minutes and that was enough of a push for me to actually be able to say for the first time in my life that I actually wanted to quit.

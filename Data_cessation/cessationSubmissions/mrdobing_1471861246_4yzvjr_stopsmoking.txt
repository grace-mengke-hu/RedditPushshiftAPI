1 year and I didn't even realize!

Just came here to check how many days I've been. Was shocked to see I have been smoke free a year! 

I feel fantastic and I want to thank everyone for the support. Just having somewhere to come to and help others is a massive aid.  

Keep counting the days and take it slow. I feel much healthier (albeit, slightly heavier) but I have just signed up for a gym membership. Time to get back in shape.  

If anyone wants any tips on getting to 1 year shoot away!

23 days smoke free today but I'm not doing it for myself...

I stopped smoking on November 1st because I was tired of feeling like I was a slave to my habit but mostly because I want to prove to my dad that quitting IS possible. He tried to stop many many times but unfortunately he always went back to it. We used to smoke together all the time and have "breaks" together. It was our bounding and discussion time. I want to prove him that if i can do it he can do it too. There is nothing I want more than for my dad to stop smoking... any advice on what to say to him that would have any impact?

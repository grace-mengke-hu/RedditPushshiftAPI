Tired

I am sick of this shit but i just cannot stop smoking. I am a student and cannot afford to spend any more of my money in daily cigarettes but the cravings are too much to control. I know that i should simply stop yet i cannot. I don't want to smoke anymore. I don't even get a rush from it like before. This is so much pathetic and shameful that i cannot have control over these minor urges. When i stop smoking i find the hit in masturbation or alcohol. I am simply tired. Marijuana ain't done nothing but make things worse. My social life has gone to shit. My education has gone to shit. I have stopped caring about myself. My parents are not rich and i realise that i am just a burden . Fuck, my father just came in asking me what am i going to get my shit together . He was broken. He is old and i should be able to take care of my family now. I wish they kick me out and or let me go on my way but they still have hope and their hope eats me from the inside as i cannot live upto their expectations. I wish i could just die but that would cause even more pain to my parents. I wish i could die. It would be easy and simple and i would make it neat and quick. Maybe things will sort out after it, there won't be a burden of feeding another mouth. And a dead person cannot be bothered by shame or guilt or pain. There isn't anything working out for me right now anyways and nobody is dependent on me so there won't be any real suffering apart for emotions. But these are just my fantasies , i am too much of a coward to die. I wish there was an accident. It could be painful and gore and gross, i don't mind. Atleast something new will happen to me.

Tomorrow is two weeks in...

And I honestly never thought I'd get here.
It seemed like every time I quit I would fail miserably , constantly creating excuses of why I should have one, bumming off of friends, etc.
And then I realized that I just needed to stay in the mind-set I had every time I would said "I quit".

I couldn't do it without the support of my mother. That helped a lot.
She never took me seriously when I said I quit because I would always start up again, but I think she realized that I needed a little push to get me going. Seriously though, a little support from a role-model is so much more helpful then all those anti-tobacco commercials combined.

I know I have a long way to go, but I already feel I've made so much progress. It isn't even much of a problem hanging around my friends that smoke anymore, which was the hardest part. My mind is finely at ease with the fact that I am a non-smoker now.

Thanks /r/stopsmoking! The success stories and the support towards myself and others are truly appreciated! And a good luck to all of those on day one! Even if you fall sometimes, as long as you get up and keep running you'll eventually make it to that goal.

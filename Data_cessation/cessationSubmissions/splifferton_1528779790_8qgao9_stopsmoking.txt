I have a windows phone, with a windows kick smoking app. So, I am pasting a screen shot.

I haven't been completely perfect, I screwed up 3 specific times .  But I think 3 cigs (and not much more than a quarter each) out of around 840 is pretty close to 0.

An old manager told me that you should aim to restrict, instead of eliminate.  That way, if you make a mistake, it's not the end of your journey, it's just a mistake.

My last mistake was 11 days ago.  

But my commitment to reduce my smoking started 7 weeks and 4 days ago, and since then I have only made 3 mistakes.  But I remain committed. Even if I stumble, I will not give up.

So much for that...

I am weak.

Today was 31 days.  It was going well.  Until I quit my job, feeling on top of the world, and immediately ran into the most discouraging job search imaginable.  Which was okay.  Until yesterday.  I got a job, finally.  It's not one I want, it's going to really suck, and I don't know if it will support me.  And my girlfriend who has supported me and made life so much easier dumped me.  I have no friends to fall back on.

I know cigarettes will just make everything worse.  I don't want to smoke anymore.  I know.  I know.  I know.  But I bought a pack.

Back to square fucking one.

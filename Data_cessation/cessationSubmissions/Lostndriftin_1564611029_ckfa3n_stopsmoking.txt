So glad I’ve failed before

I’ve quit so many times in the past—one quit lasting an hour and the longest 3 months (a record I’m about to beat 😁). The beginning is painful and unrelenting, but then it gets easier as promised. 

It’s the “easier” that I am finding challenging. The majority of the day is fine and then a subtle craving comes out of the clear blue sky whispering in my ear I could only smoke one. Just for a laugh. To see what it would be like. 

Of course, it’s absurd and nothing more than the manipulation of addiction. It’s insidious because it doesn’t feel like a craving. I don’t NEED a smoke— it’s just curiosity or control or a lark. 

But thankfully, I have failed so many times before so I know that it is a scam. I know that the smoke that I’m thinking about does not exist. It will not be this relaxing satisfying experience. It will smell bad, taste bad, draw oddly, and I will feel jittery, nauseous, and guilty, but I will persist without realizing it until I’m back to a pack a day! 

So armed with my past failed experience, I will keep my guard up and hopefully make it through the “easier” until I find out what’s on the other side 😊

Quitting on Wednesday, wish I'd never started!!!

I started smoking eight years ago. :( 

I was 18, and had had a controlling boyfriend throughout school who wouldn't let me try anything at all – drinking (in a country where the drinking age was 16), smoking, soft drugs, travelling without him: all these things were off the table.

He split up with me, and I was naturally furious. I had led a very sheltered and controlled life for two years, and all for nothing! The first thing I did was buy a packet of cigarettes and teach myself how to smoke.

Thought I wasn't hooked.

Realised about six months later that I was totally hooked – once I became a pack-a-day smoker.

At around 21, I decided to quit smoking, and start vaping. I've only ever relapsed once – in my first "big break" job. I guess I wanted to make friends. HR told me off for going off for so many smoking breaks, and I kicked the habit again pretty quickly, and went back to vaping.

In all my years of smoking, though, I've never tried to cut out nicotine. I've been afraid of failure, and have lied to myself about how the vape has limited effects.

I don't want to be enslaved by this addiction anymore, though. It's time to stop.

I've read most of Alan Carr's Easyway. Wednesday is the day I chuck all my expensive vape equipment in a public bin so I can't fish it back out. I can't wait.

WISH ME LUCK, GUYS &lt;3

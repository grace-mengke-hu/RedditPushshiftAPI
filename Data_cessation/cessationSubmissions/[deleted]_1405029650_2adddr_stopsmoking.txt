Here we go again

Right now my counter for this sub sits at 1133 days, but is inaccurate. I stopped smoking for a little over two years, and was to the point where cigarettes were not only not an option, not something I ever thought about or even considered, but gross things that made me feel sympathy for the people who were addicted.

That's when a confluence of circumstances led me to the idiotic choice to start up again. I lost a home. Then injured both my Achilles while running and had to stop. Then a few months later, lost my job. Where immediately after being walked out the door, I drove to a gas station and bought a pack. Smoking didn't change any of it, but I used these circumstances to start again. There was a lead-up, shortly after leaving the house, I ended up smoking a couple of times while drinking. It tasted terrible, but poor judgement made it easier. Those couple of times got it in my head again, and that's all it took.

So here I am again, about to order Easy Way again, since I gave my copy away to a friend who was trying to quit. I plan on leaving my day counter alone until I quit again, and since it is so close, why not pick 1337 as the day I will stop again. Circumstances are better, but circumstances aren't what decides what I do. I hate smoking, I've been feeling pain and numbness in my extremities, I cough all the time, waste my money, and don't want to smell like shit all the time anymore. Limiting myself financially, romantically, and destroying my health has to stop. I'm so glad this community is here, you helped me so much the first time, I think I know a lot more about what to expect this time.

18 Hours in and I realized my Girlfriend must really love me....

I just realized how nasty my car smells. She must really like me considering I've been driving her around for the last 5 months in that dirty thing. I couldn't put up with that!   


I spent all morning just cleaning and making things all nice with the extra time I'm saving from my usual morning, chain\-smoking.  


I read "Easy Way To Stop Smoking" yesterday and had my last cigarette last night.   


I'm fuckin' done. That chapter is over in my life.   


I'm excited to see the true results in a few months time and I know I will struggle here and there but mostly, it's going to be easy :\)  


This subreddit has been and will continue to be a great resource for me.  


Thanks guys! :\)

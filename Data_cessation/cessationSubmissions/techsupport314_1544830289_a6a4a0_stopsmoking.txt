Improved cognitive ability after quitting?

Did anyone notice a marked improvement in memory and learning after quitting smoking? How about mental illnesses like depression and anxiety...did it get worse or improve? How long before noticing improvements? I've been having a hard time learning and memorizing new concepts these past few years. Learning new things used to be so easy, but now it seems like I have to give it my all to retain information. I'm seeking wisdom and advice from people who have traveled this road

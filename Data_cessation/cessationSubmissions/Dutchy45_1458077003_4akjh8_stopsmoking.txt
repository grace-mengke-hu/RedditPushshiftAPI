challenge overcome!

Today a friend who is a smoker visited. First he called and I was a bit apprehensive not knowing how I would deal with it. I need not have worried, I was only minimally tempted and controlled myself much easier than I feared. I see it as significant and a big step forward. On I go not smoking.

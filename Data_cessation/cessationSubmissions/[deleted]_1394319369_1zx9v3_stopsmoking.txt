Question about Chantix

I've been on taking Chantix the past two weeks. First week while smoking, and tonight at midnight will be one week smoke free (thanks for the help!!) My question is, how long much longer do I have to take it for? I don't really have cravings, and find other things to do, but I am getting moody at times and can get short and angry with people. I don't know if its the Chantix making me shitty or being without smoking. I smoked for about 9 months. Before that I had quit for about 2 years.

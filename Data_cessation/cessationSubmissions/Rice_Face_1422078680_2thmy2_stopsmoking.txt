Pass the time!

I've started reading more. You can pull a novel out almost anywhere! I started the Lord of the Rings series and well, I'm enjoying every bit of it. 

I pull it out at the park, while waiting for financial aid or for my car to finish at the shop, during work, and near the library windows *inside.*

The best thing is I can put it down at any time, *unlike a cigarette.* Also, it's an activity I can do indoors or out without much strenuous work. On the introvert side, sometimes people don't even notice I'm there!

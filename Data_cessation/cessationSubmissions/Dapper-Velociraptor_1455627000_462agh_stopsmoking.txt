Former athlete: Will I ever get my endurance back?

I was a well decorated in soccer, football, and rugby. There were times in high school where I had three practices a day, two was pretty common. I'd competed in modified triathlons and ran in 10mile (16km) runs, I did well in both. Even with these successes I had picked up smoking when I was 18.

I got hooked pretty quick. I told myself it was a training tool; if I could do something physical when I was smoking, it'd be easier when I wasn't smoking. Laughable. For a while I had cut back but would always bum a smoke at parties. Through that time, about 3 years, my endurance didn't change much. 

Not until recently, I had a sharp decline in any kind of cardio. I got depressed after a break up a year and a half ago in conjunction with some substance abuse (how I want you in my arms). I stopped playing sports all together and smoked between a half and full pack a day. I've just turned that page and my life and need to get back into sports, but I can barely run 10 minutes with out stopping, in contrast to 10 miles ran at a 7min pace 3 years ago.

Will I ever get my endurance back? What type of training should I do? Diet? How long until I see results? What trend line does the recovery rate look most like?

TL;DR Was rad at sports (soccer, rugby, lacrosse). Started smoking with some regularity, still rad at sports. Stop playing sports for a year and a half and smoked between half and full pack a day, and I can't run for more than 10 minutes now. How can I get my endurance back?
 

Thanks for the encouraging words. Does anyone have scientific resources on the topic, aside from a basic infograph?

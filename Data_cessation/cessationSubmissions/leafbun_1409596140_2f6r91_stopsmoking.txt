I'm finally quitting

I have an interview at Whole Foods later this week and this is my inspiration to stop smoking. I feel as though I couldn't work there and have such an unhealthy habit. I've been smoking since I was 15 and and I turned 19 yesterday, I think it's time for a change in my life. I want to start running and doing more yoga to get all this shit out of my lungs, especially because my lungs have been hurting recently. I looked in my mouth the other day too and the roof and under my tongue is entirely covered in white splotches which is concerning to me. I'm not sure what else to say as this post is more or less a physical mark of the day I quit so that I can keep track of my progress.

Hit a year today

Found you guys through /r/stopdrinking, and wanted to share.  I smoked for over 10 years and for a long time never thought I'd be able to quit. One year ago, after multiple attempts I finally kicked it for good.  I was tired of gasping for air.  I was tired of smelling like shit and feeling like shit.  I was tired of all the money it costed me. 

At first there were some shitty days where I wanted to give up but they lessened.  A friend recommended Allan Carr's book and it did wonders for how I looked at smoking.  I don't feel like I'm missing out and ya know what?  A shitty situation is a a shitty situation with or without cigs. 

I actually forgot that this was my year until I looked at the calendar this morning, and that feeling of success is second to none. 

You all got this

Sense of Smell after quitting

One of the main reason I started smoking, years ago, was that my sense of smell was too... strong.

I had serious problems with every strong smell, floreal ones more than anything. Perfumes, close places, exhaust emissions from cars gave me really bad headache and nausea, just to give you the idea.

Now, I really want to stop smoking, but I am afraid that it will came back to the old situation, one day, and I have no idea how I can deal with that. No doctor really believed me when I was young, and I don't have a precise idea of what branch of medicine deals with the sense of smell and if it can be helped.

Online there was/is a lot of literature about anosmia (lessened sense of smell), but not as much about hyperosmia (enhanced) and his effects on everyday life. Mostly they deal with temporary hyperosmia, as a side effect to other problems.

Smoking for me was a really "easy" way to fix it, because the smell of smoke covered everything around, and ultimately reduced every odor even while not smoking.

Does anyone have a similar background?
Any idea or thought is welcome :-)


EDIT: I think it was a mistake, writing here. Never mind, I am sort of used not being able to explain how bad is "too many odors" and "headache and nausea" compared to the regular bad smells. :-)

Happy quitting everyone, I wish you all well. -unfollow, unsubscribe-

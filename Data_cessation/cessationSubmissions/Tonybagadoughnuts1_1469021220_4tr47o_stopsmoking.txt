This time I've decided I'm never smoking again!  That being said it has not been easy!  I have cravings constantly.  Being around smokers is the best motivation for me to quit.  It's the times I'm alone that my mind tries to play tricks on me.  I've done alot research on will power and addiction.  Learning about why I feel the way I do has been extremely helpful.   I'm going to the gym every other day, and I feel great!  I just really want to reach the top of the mountain!

How do I not smoke while I drink?

Okay so I really need some help here. Obviously I have my emotional triggers as we, but like most smokers, I can't not smoke while I drink. Rather, I smoke more than my usual amount while I'm drinking since the urge is simply amplified.
I quit a week ago and I haven't had an opportunity to drink since then. But that can't possibly be a permanent solution. 
Could some of you pros please share with us how you deal/have successfully dealt with this situation?

Thanks guys for your tips. I see so many way to stay strong.
To summarize some of the suggestions till now for newbies like me:
1. Practice some light to moderate drinking home alone/with non-smoking company where there are no smokes within your reach at all. 
2. Stay in the non-smoking zones. 
3. Make a list of reasons for quitting on your phone and look at it when you get the urge
4. Avoid getting shitfaced till you have a control over your urges. 
5. Meditation approach

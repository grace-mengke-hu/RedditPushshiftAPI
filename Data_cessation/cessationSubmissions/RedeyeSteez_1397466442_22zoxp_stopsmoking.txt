[13 days] 6 days into quitting i was Diagnosed with mono

This is the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I don't feel like smoking very often due to the fact my throat has been extremely swollen and painful but the mood swings, irritability, and feelings of depression have really made things hard. Haven't really been able to find anyone who can relate or give advice to my situation yet.

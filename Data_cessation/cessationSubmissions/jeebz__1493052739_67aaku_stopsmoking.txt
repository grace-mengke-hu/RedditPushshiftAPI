13 days in. Another day. Another achievement.

Finally made it to 13 days. Day 10 onwards seemed like such a massive struggle for some reason but I powered through it. This is the longest time I've ever quit for and I'm feeling pretty damn proud. 

Cravings are very inconsistent. as are withdrawal symptoms. They come and go at really weird times and hit really hard too. But I'm powering on!

Day 1

I've been wanting to do this for years, and lurking on this sub for a while until I finally built up the courage to actually do it, but today is my first day without a cigarette in fifteen years.  I'm on the patch and it's working so far but... fuck this is hard.  I miss smoking already, even though I know it's nothing but bad for me.

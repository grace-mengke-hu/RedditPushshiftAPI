Quitting my vape today.

Not sure if this is welcome here, because I never smoked cigs.  But I've been vaping nicotine for a while (started because I thought it was cool/I was stressed/I'm a dumbass) and I've decided to quit.  It's not healthy, it doesn't bring anything positive into my life, and it's expensive!  

Posting this here to hold myself accountable.  Sending good vibes to you all.

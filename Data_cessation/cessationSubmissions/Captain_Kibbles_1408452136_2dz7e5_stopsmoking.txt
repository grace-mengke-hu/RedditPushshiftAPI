30 Days, Thanks guys!

With classes starting up in a week I'm happy to announce that I've managed to go 30 day without a cigarette.

Those first few weeks were absolute hell but the tips and advice I got from here really helped me out.  

Thank you all and here's to looking forward to another thirty days with smoke free lungs!

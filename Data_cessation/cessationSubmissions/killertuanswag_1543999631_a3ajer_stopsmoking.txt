Having trouble quitting nicotine devices

I quit smoking cigarettes by switching over the suorin, juul, etc.. Now this has become an issue. The max I can go without it is a day and I start fiending. Thing is i'm around my friends a lot and they also have it on them at all times. I gave mine for my friend to hold as well but it is still now helping. Any tips would be great

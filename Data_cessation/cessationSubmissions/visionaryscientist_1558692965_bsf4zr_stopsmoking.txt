Help needed

It's been 84 years.. Ok jks aside it's just been 3 days and I can't concentrate on anything. Always zoned out at work, i feel like a robot only breathing and existing. (this is my first attempt for quitting) I'm a 28 f smoking for 6years. Never stopped never even a day. 

My mind is playing tricks on me. Trying to convince me to smoke. "I've been thinking why did I ever quit. I love smoking so much :( " the worst part is I'm constantly thinking like this to the point I cry involuntarily because I can't smoke. But I didn't give in.

I've read some articles about nicotine vs tobacco from Google scholar. I have an e-cig in my bag (in case) but didn't use that also. But I'm thinking of using it because it's so hard.. I didn't think I'm this weak. I always knew I was an addict.

Please help me? I need some opinions. Should I use e-cig or torture myself(and for how long)
My mood swings are mess also I'm crying right now...

Thanks in advance..

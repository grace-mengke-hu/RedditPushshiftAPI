First smoke free day...

Been smoking for a few years on/off. I began smoking in the army, then I started smoking only while drinking. Then slowly it became an every day habit and soon I was smoking pack a day. Then I decided that enough is enough.

I've been gradually smoking less and less cigarettes every day for the last two months. Today is my first day with zero fags and I intend to keep these days coming, for the rest of my life.

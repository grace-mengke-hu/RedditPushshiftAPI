Roped back in

It's been over 5 years of stopping and starting. I've gone from 1 cigarette a day to a pack a day down to none and back up again. Obviously triggered by alcohol, but I don't drink as much. Now I'm triggered by taking gigs late at night. I keep buying packs, smoking half and throwing them away. Each time vowing it's the last pack. The motivation is there, I just lack the will power. Just bought another pack, and felt compelled to find this thread and see what sort of advice anyone may have to offer.

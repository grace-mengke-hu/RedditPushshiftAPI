Day one - saying hi.

After many years tobacco free I started up again nearly 2 years ago (WHY!?). I'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired and burning money I could use for more positive things. I just have to make it from here to bed without lighting up and I'll have my first 24 hours. Thanks for being here, I'll check in frequently. Cheers.

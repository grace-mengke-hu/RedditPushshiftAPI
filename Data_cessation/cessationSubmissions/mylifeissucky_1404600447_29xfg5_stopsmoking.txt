Holy fuck, Dizzy as hell tonight.

 Had to grip onto the handrail hard on the stairs down to supper tonight. Jeez, really entertaining.

I stopped smoking last night 'round 9PM CST. Right before supper, I just got fucking dizzy. I think I know what it is...

Now that more oxygen is beginning to get into me now that it is nearly 24 hours since that last smoke, u think that'd make me dizzy as hell?

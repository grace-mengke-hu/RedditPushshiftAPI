Day 1... aaaand I don't want to do this anymore.

It's literally only been, like, ten hours since I agreed to quit with my girlfriend.  I hate how duplicitous I feel when it comes to smoking, and not really just out of addiction.  I just like it.  But I also want to quit, the benefits are just too enormous not to.  No, I'm not going to vape.  Ughhhh.

Two weeks in and the cravings have stopped!

I know it may bite me in the ass for saying that my cravings are now non existent, but HEY! It sure as hell beats the first few days where I was a nervous wreck throughout the day. I work in radio and my voice has become a little high pitched out of nowhere, but I think people are liking it.

At least the fiance enjoys the new morning breath. ;)

FUCK YEAH!

Not gonna go back, But I'm having quite a hard time.

Month and a half today. As I told you before, I'm battling anxiety disorder and depression. Battling, as in actively trying to kick their asses and change the (negative) ways I react to everything.

Whenever I see friends which I know as non-smokers light one (drunk, mostly), I feel angry at them, lonely and sad.
Whenever I see a stranger smoking, I feel angry and sad.
It seems to me that I started having a bad, anxiety based obbession with smokers. Instead of shrugging it off, or thinking the allen carr way  (aka "good for me, I don't need to smoke anymore!") I get obessed with reading about cravings, looking for others who have a hard time as me. My common sense says I need to let it go. That the only way to get rid of the addiction (and anxiety, I think) is to stop searching for answers and just deal with it.

Any advice?

I really hate myself right now.

On the anniversary of my quit date, I made one of the dumbest decisions and I think I'm going to regret it. 

See, my plan for quitting was always to use a vape for as little time as possible and push myself to a full non-smoking state quickly. A month ago, I put out my last cigarette and went to bed. The next day, I got up and started vaping on 9mg juice. I did that for the first two weeks, while my body adjusted and then switched to 6mg juice for a week. Finally, at the beginning of my 4th week, I switched myself to 3mg juice. Everything has been going well. Yeah, I had withdrawals, but using the vape was giving me the confidence to keep going and the nicotine in it was taking the edge off a bit.

With my 1-month anniversary coming up, I decided to try to get off of nicotine. If you read my post yesterday, you will know what my plan was for today. If not, I went out and got myself some nicotine lozenges and went to work with those, a vaporizer with 3mg juice, and a vaporize with 0mg juice.

Well, I got in the car this morning and headed to work. I was having an internal struggle with myself and wasn't sure if I should just use the lozenges according to the instruction sheet, or just pop one in if I started suffering a bad craving. I decided to go ahead and use a lozenge straight away and figured that I would push myself as long as possible to the next lozenge and figure out how long I could go to establish a schedule.

The instructions said that the lozenge should dissolve in 20-30 minutes, but that damn thing just would not dissolve in my mouth. I was right at about 50 minutes of holding it in my mouth when I finally did what the instructions advised against and just chewed up the last little bit to get rid of it. Man, that sucked and I really didn't enjoy the lozenge. The only good thing about it was that they changed since I last tried them and are apparently available in cherry now, which is way better than the mint.

I digress. Anyway, I made it to the office shortly after finishing off my lozenge and settled in, preparing myself for the day's fight with nicotine cravings. I found that I kept staring at the clock, watching it and trying to decide when I was going to have to use another lozenge. I decided to pass a bit of time so I went back and watched the Allen Carr video on YouTube and then went into a 6-part series of videos that Google kept suggesting to me. Here they are:

As I watched the videos, I stopped looking at the clock. I stopped waiting for a craving to come on. The next thing I knew, my day was over. Now, it is 9:15 at night, and I'll be going to bed shortly and I realized that I haven't had any nicotine since that lozenge that sat in my mouth from around 6:30-7:30 this morning. I really don't even think that 2mg lozenge did anything for me really.

This is when I realized that I messed up and I started to hate myself. See, I figured why not and went ahead and bought the big pack of lozenges while I was at Wally World, but now I think that one lozenge will be the only one that I ever actually use out of it. That means I paid around $35 for a single nicotine lozenge. Ugh!

Anyway, the good news is that I haven't really felt any different today than I have the previous days. That's not to say that I feel great, I still feel like I didn't quite sleep well enough last night, but that's it. I'm done. All I have to do is wait for my body to rebalance the dopamine production and I'll be good. 

Hang in there quitters, we got this!

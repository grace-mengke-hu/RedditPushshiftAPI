Starting slow?

Hi everyone.  I have recently had my life turned upside down and I am trying to fix the things that I see wrong with me.  Smoking is obvious.  I have been trying to start for about a week, but I can't seem to bring myself to not go out for a smoke.  Today was my first minor success.  I usually have a smoke about every 2 hours.  Today after work, I have managed to do every 4 hours.  This might not seem significant, but I think it's a good start.  

Let me know if anyone has tried this and had success/failure with this method. thanks.

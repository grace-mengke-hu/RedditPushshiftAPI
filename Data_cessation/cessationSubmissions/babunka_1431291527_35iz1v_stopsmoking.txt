Shamefully reseting

I don't even want to admit how much I smoked, guys. It's just that I had that one cigarette and then I thought everything was OK and under control. Then I had one of those those awkward social situations where I thought the only way out was to smoke. And I know that if I hadn't had that one cigarette, I wouldn't have done it. Now I still lack inner motivation, I find great pleasure in smoking but I've really disappointed the people I told and it makes me feel great shame. So, I am going to bed now and tomorrow I am going to start counting again!
P.S. I am even ashamed to admit my failure to you, but I know this is the right place to do it. Thank you for the support last time and I know that thanks to this subreddit I am going to do it again : )!

Threw away my packet of 20

I have had a series of addictions this year including alcohol and cigarettes. I drank everyday and smoked everyday. A packet of 20 would last me 4-5 days or less when I was drinking in public. I'm only 19 so to me this is really bad. I started smoking in February of this year and stopped in June. I only stopped because I was in NYC at the time where you have to be 21 to purchase cigarettes. I just recently got to the UK (where I live) yesterday to be exact. I got Â£10 off my grandma and I feel really bad for buying a pack of 20 the first moment I got here. It was terrible, smoking for the first time in like 3-4 months was a really big shock to my system since when I'm in NY I always eat healthy since my dad is vegetarian. The smoke hurt my stomach and made me feel really messed up. I just thought it was me being weak and not used to it after not smoking for so long. Today I decided to go out and smoke again. Worst mistake ever as I had a severe panic attack and my stomach feels really bad. I gagged a few times but nothing came out. I gave the pack of cigarettes to my mom and told her to keep them away from me. An hour later/ Now I grabbed the pack and tore the cigarettes in half and threw them away. 

I am really proud of myself and I really think something greater is on my side. The same thing happened with alcohol as in May I drank one whisky and coke and threw up immediately. My body is rejecting all the bad stuff from my body and I can't be more grateful. I really hope this stays that way since I'm moving into university in two weeks. I hope this message encourages all mostly young smokers to stop. If two cigarettes gave me a panic attack all in the space of minutes think about what a life time of smoking will do to you.

YES! 14 days - made it through my second weekend!

Managed to get through a 'sit in the shed and drink much wine' night with my friend who is still a heavy smoker, and I still didn't smoke - was a bit tough once I started getting nice and boozy but I'm super stoked!

Toughest test is coming up, playing at a music festival which normally means 3 days of smoking and drinking, killing time between shows with cigarettes was a big part of it normally.  I'll be up to my fourth weekend by then so I'm sure I can do it!

Keep on that quittin' mission people :)  I'm loving it.

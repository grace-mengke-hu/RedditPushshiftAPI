I hate what I've become.

I've been smoking since 2000. I was 13, and my friend and I snuck a cigarette out of her mom's purse and smoked it behind a bush. 15 years later, I'm still hooked. For the last five years, it's been a huge source of shame for me because I tried and failed to quit five years ago and I find the habit disgusting. I'm tired of scheduling my days around cigarettes, I'm tired of the cravings, I'm tired of smelling like an ashtray, and I'm just tired of smoking! Two days ago, I went into a convenience store to buy a pack of Marlboro's, but came out with a pack of nicotine gum. I'm doing it this time.

I'm so glad I found this sub. I don't have a lot of support where I live, and reading all of these stories made me feel empowered and not so alone.

Is chantix/champix really that dangerous?

I need to stop smoking. I dont even actually want to stop, after having tried multiple times and succeeding for max 3 months as my record. I've heard from a friend of mine that it worked as a miracle drug for her, without any noticable unusual side effects. The reason i want to quit is mostly because my asthma is really taking it's toll, i realise that if i keep my current smoking habit (25 cigs a day) it moght put me in serious danger. Cause my asthma keeps getting worst to the point where i fear for my health big time. Still somehow i dont feel that much of an urge to stop except for my fear of my asthma which keeps getting worse. Overall i dont notice big health differences other than asthma attacks. And my only reason to quit, i think, is out of fear of these asthma attacks. 

Even though thats pretty serious my urge/motivation/discipline to quit is not enough for me. Thats why i thought this would really help me

Upon reading a lot of threads on Reddit about champix/chantix that shit scared me big time. And i wonder if its really as bad or if it can be really as bad as it sounds..

So what overall do you guys this about chantix/champix?

Keeping cigs around to feel "safe"?

I'm not sure if this would work or has worked for any of you before, but when I was addicted to painkillers for 5 yrs, the times I tried to quit and got rid of them completely I would feel so much sicker and wanted them so badly.

The last time I quit (and for good) I always kept around 10 in my pocket and would have kind of a "safe" feeling of "I know you're sick and all you have to do is take one of these to make these feelings go away, but sooner or later they'll be back when you try to quit the next time, and it'll be a cycle of sickness and pain"..

I know this is completely a pyschological thing and it being my first day of a non-smoker I can't compare nicotine withdrawals to opiate withdrawals, (besides the irritation and tiredness so far)

Has anyone tried keeping cigs around just to make themselves feel better knowing they can make the shitty feelings go away but choose to fight through it?

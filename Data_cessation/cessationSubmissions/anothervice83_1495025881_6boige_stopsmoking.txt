16 days, 9 hours... About to cave..

I made it this far (after smoking for almost 22 years) but I swear the cravings are getting worse and harder to control and FUCKKKK my emotional stability has gone straight to hell. I hate the new, non smoking me. I'm so miserable and cry nonstop. My husband isn't supportive and even my kids think I was less stressed out before. Will this anger, irritably and frustration ever leave me or am I branded for life?

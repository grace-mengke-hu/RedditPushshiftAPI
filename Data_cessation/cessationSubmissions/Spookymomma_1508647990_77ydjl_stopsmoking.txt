Recovering from walking pneumonia, today is my 3 week clean from cigs. I am having a very rough time coping, I could really use some moral support.

I got real sick, couldn't breathe, and part of recovering was saying goodbye to cigs.  I am 3 weeks clean today but it has not been easy.  Stress all around me, living with 2 other people that smoke and don't seem to have probs lighting up around me.  I am ready to scream, cry, have a huge bitch fit, something's gotta give.  I can't give in but oh the temptation is there, everywhere I look.

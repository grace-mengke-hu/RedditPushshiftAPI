Let me tell you how I've quit smoking for six months now

Today, I have not smoked a cigarette in six months. Let me tell you how I did it.

I used to smoke a lot. I had the feeling I was more addicted than other smokers. Whenever I couldn't smoke, I wasn't able to get it out of my mind.

I tried a lot of ways to stop smoking, but nothing worked. I thought I would never be able to quit. Until someone told me of a book he read.

This book basically explains you how a nicotine addiction works. The reason quitting is so hard is not really because of the physical addiction, but by the way it influences your subcounscious: the psychological addiction.

The book, written by Kristina Ivings, is called Free Yourself from Smoking.

To anyone who thinks quitting is impossible for you, I would strongly advice reading this book. 

Good luck!

Relapsed after 8 months and I’m kind of scared.

 I had a beautiful summer last year, smoke free for the best part of the year. After the Christmas party I relapsed. 
 It started slowly, maybe 1 pack / week, but it immediatly got to almost a pack a day. It feels so bad now, i’m 5 months in. 
 The thing is I miss so much being a non-smoker again and I want to quit again, but I’m kind of scared again, I don’t know why. 
 Do you guys have any advice? Go hard, go easy, I think any kind of tip would help. 
 Thanks in advance!

After too many sleepless nights due to a fear of death and cancer, I have quit.

I've quit many times, sometimes for years at a time. I just can't deal with constantly worrying about cancer and death anymore. It's just not worth it. I'm tired of the sinking feelings of fear in my chest. I'm tired of thinking every pain and cough might be cancer or emphysema.

Going to give it another go

Just put out my last smoke, I desperately want this to be my last. I'm a roughly pack and a half day smoker. Have been smoking for the last 8ish years. Been able to quit for 3-6 months a handful of times, lately I've been finding it a lot more difficult to even get past the first few hours. I think my problem is that I don't want to quit entirely. I don't enjoy it, I know my health is a risk, I sure as hell don't want my daughter to grow up knowing her daddy is a smoker, but I still don't "want" to quit. My biggest motivation is the money saved, I enjoy my money. 

I'm a very strong person, I know I can to anything I put my mind to. The thing is when I quit smoking the enemy I face is me.

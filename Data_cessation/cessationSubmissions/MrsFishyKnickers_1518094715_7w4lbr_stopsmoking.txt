What's going on with me? Am I still recovering from nicotine withdrawal?

Hi all, this is my first time posting. I'm 105 days clear of nicotine, I decided to go cold turkey after years of mucking about with vaporizers, which always led back to cigarettes. 

I would have hoped that by now I would be feeling the benefits of quitting, but other than having a clear chest, which is wonderful, I'm finding myself falling apart physically! My skin is terrible and dry, I'm still not sleeping properly, I'm getting anxiety still, and I'm still getting irritable. I also don't want to get out of my bed. Ever. 

I realise that I have been addicted to nicotine since before I existed as both my parents smoked and my mother smoked during her pregnancy. I've always been exposed to it. This is the first time in my life, and I am now 42, that it's been gone, and I feel like it's killing me! 
I've put loads of weight on and I feel like I've aged virtually overnight! 

Sorry for the long, whining post, think I need a bit of validation as I'm feeling very sorry for myself.

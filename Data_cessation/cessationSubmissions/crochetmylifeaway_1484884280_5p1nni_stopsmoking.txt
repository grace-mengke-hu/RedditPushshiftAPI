Decided to quit after 12 years of smoking.

Smoked anywhere from half a pack to a pack and a half a day throughout the years. It's been 3 long days, but I'm doing ok. I've had lots of mood swings and insomnia, but I'm determined to kick the habit. Is there a good app or something I can use to track my progress? Thanks in advance.

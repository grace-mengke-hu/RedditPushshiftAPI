Kids can be so cruel

Today is day number 16 smoke free and day number 5 nicotine patch free. It has been rough going since getting off the patch but I am managing the struggle quite well. However....

I have 3 sons. They are ages 17, 15 and 3. Within the last couple of months my oldest son has been going through quite the rebellious stage. Wanting to act and be treated like an adult but not quite there yet in maturity. This is of course a normal teenage stage but let me tell you, just because it's normal does NOT make it easy.

He has said things to me in the last several weeks that would bring any loving mother to tears. It has been extremely difficult to sustain not smoking when you have someone you love and care about actively telling you how awful they think you are.

I am not perfect and I am not a perfect mother. But I love my kids more than my own life. They are the reason I'm even still a part of this planet. Without them I would have ended my life long ago. So to hear such hateful things from my own child is very upsetting especially since part of my motivation to quit smoking was for my children.

I guess I'm just trying to say that I'm not going to smoke no matter what but I really needed to vent to people who would understand. Thank you for listening.

I'm quitting smoking tonight

As the title says, I will be quitting tonight. I will smoke for five more hours. I will start 2014 smoke free. I'm 17 years old, so better quit now right? But due to issues with depression it is really hard for me to do it. Does anyone have any last minute tips?

Edit: I have smoked my last cigarette and started 2014 as a non-smoker! Happy new year everybody!

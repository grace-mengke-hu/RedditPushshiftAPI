Was able to quit smoking for 9 hours. Then I started hallucinating monsters (indignant/disgusting/inhuman) crawling on my face and their cronies stopping me from fighting them off and caused me to break down and buy a pack.

Schizophrenia sucks and for some reason smoking really helps calm me and distract me during the unpleasant symptoms. I think it was a combo of chewing a piece of gum I had laying around that started withdrawal again and also my medicine wearing off cause it’s the end of the day. I’m going to try again next week and take my night medicine sooner; I got rid of the gum this time.  I got to get change healthcare in 6 months and don’t want to pay $280 a month instead of $120 dollars a month for healthcare, because that is like 18% of my income before taxes just for health insurance compared to 8%.   

Sadly I have to quit 100% and not use replacement nicotine because I’m fairly certain that the health insurance just does nicotine tests so I would have to pay more even if I was using gum/ecig. If I can’t do it cold turkey I might try to use an ecig and eventually drop down to 0/mg juice. Another thing I might try is just smoking something that’s not tobacco like mint or something, the hallucinations telling me that “If I’m not torturing myself to death then they are entitled to torture me to death.”  Being crazy sucks, but you’ve got to make do with what you got.

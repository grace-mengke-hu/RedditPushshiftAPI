That delightful coffee.

I'll guess most of you already have had this happen, or it might happen soon after quitting. 

I'm finding that I don't much enjoy coffee any more. In fact it kind of reminds me of when I was a child going yuck. I've always used cream and sugar But this doesn't seem to help so much now. It's just so .. thick.. and so.. burn't tasting... yeah. I think that's it. That strangely burnt taste. And I think that is why it works so well with cigarettes and vice versa. 

I still drink a cup in the morning probably just out of habit, but find that orange juice actually wakes me better now. I also have became a tea drinker for part of the day. mainly because I'm so used to drinking something throughout the day. The best part is i've been drinking water and eating fruits like they're going out of style, with my new hobby of jogging.

Maybe this is just ranting and rambling and just putting it out there for others to be inspired by.

I've been using this subreddit as a cure for my cravings.

24 days in (14 cold turkey), like a lot of people on the sub (funny that!) and whilst I'm past the worst and the cravings are getting less and less I'm still getting them, mainly from visual cues, I was just looking through a drawer for a key and found a old clipper lighter, sparked to see if it still worked and that triggered me. But coming to this sub has been great for my cravings, just reading people's success stories keeps me going. 

Great community, keep it up guys!

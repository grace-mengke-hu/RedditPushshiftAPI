It's been almost 6 hours since my last cigarette

I'm in the military, I'm stationed in San Diego right now and the weather is beautiful. I'm standing outside in the hot sun, with wind blowing on me and a hotel room to boot before I go to Japan later in the fall. I'm procrastinating working on what is going to help me get out of the military by 2022 and work a much better paying job once I do. I usually use the reason of going outside just to clear my head and a reason to smoke, and lord knows how bad I want to smoke right now. It's been 24 hours since the last time I've ground my teeth due to not having a cigarette. I'm bored, but don't want to sit down and study for college. My mind is running at million miles per minute and a cigarette would narrow them out. I'm lonely but don't feel like interacting with people because I would just go to a 7/11 and grab a pack of cigarettes. I want to stop smoking but really dont want to. I have a problem. I should be sitting down and studying but instead I'm sitting outside waiting for a cigarette because that gives me a reason to be out here.

Sorry, just felt like bitching because it's my first day.

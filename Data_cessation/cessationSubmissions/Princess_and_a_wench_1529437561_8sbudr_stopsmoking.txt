I tried quitting a million times, but replacing my cigarette budget and building a routine with these items helped it finally stick.

I suck at titles so sorry for that.

This may or may not help anyone or matter at all. But if it helps one person,  I’m happy 

**A brief about my habit-**  

I chain smoked for 3 years after my father died.  I tried quitting a million times. I read Allen carries Easyway book and that didn’t work for me whatsoever (apparently it works for everyone).

It was getting to the point that I’d have chest pain from inhaling a cigarette. I knew I couldn’t go on. I’m 31 fucking years old, that’s not ok. But still I smoked anyway.

I knew I needed to make a drastic change that I could SEE. I needed some sort of psychological boost to get through the first few weeks.

I calculated how much I roughly spent on 2 months of smoking and used that money to purchase some items that would help me look better and feel physically better.

The results that were combined with stopping smoking, I look WAY better aesthetically, but more importantly, *I am way better physically and emotionally*

May not work for everyone, but these are the products I used to help my recovery and confidence. (If I knew how to link products and knew if it was allowed, I’d do it, right now I’m not sure if either is ok)


The products and what they do 

Supplements:

Omega 3 fish oil supplement**- this one is self-explanatory

**Serrapeptase-** an enzyme/ supplement. It’s for sinus and cardiovascular help. Helps break down mucus aka really helped me get rid of the lung butter I always had. I know it made a difference because I have quit many times before that and my lungs were still messed up. This helped a lot.

**-Nattokinase** this also helped with heart health, and healthy circulation. 

**Strauss Heartdrops-** this stuff is expensive but my circulation is night and day different when I use this stuff. 

**Dr.Tobias Lungmeister-** this is another thing that helps clear my chest and has aided in me being able to breath deeply. I used to take it every day, now I take this before exercising.

**A spirometer**- before, I could barely walk up the short steps to my bathroom without my heart racing, and gasping for breath. I knew would probably keel over if I went straight to the gym. I got a cheap spirometer to work on my breathing capacity. The first few times I thought I was going to puke. After two weeks I saw a big difference.


Between all the items above, I recovered WAY faster than when I had quit previously. So much so that I never really craved a smoke again because I felt EXCELLENT.


Items of vanity that helped me quit (this may or may not matter more to the ladies. That sounds sexist perhaps, I don’t mean to be, but I don’t know many men that care as much about their skin as us gals) :

**White with style-** tooth whitening product that really helped lift my nasty yellow teeth stains.

**Franks body scrub-** helped with my circulation and after using it regularly my dry nasty cigarette skin was soft and glowy

**Foreo Luna**- I had one of these before smoking but rarely used it. But I really think this skin washing tool helped me get rid of dead skin and brought circulation back to my skin. I wash my face with cetaphil and this tool.

**DIY Dermarolling-** lots to explain, so I’ll let you research give your body a couple weeks for the nicotine to get out of your system, then give this a shot. My skin looked FABULOUS after I started doing this. I do it once every 2-3 weeks at .05mm

**Argan Oil**- I put it on my face before bed at night. Helped with my dry parched skin. 

It feels weird telling you guys my beauty regimen,  but it REALLY gave me something to replace my normal smoking routine.


Between these supplements and beauty routine, I kicked my habit for good and I haven’t looked back. I was able to ease back into exercise without feeling I was going to have an asthma attack/faint/puke like I felt the last times I quit.

My friends, family and coworkers have all noticed and complimented on how fantastic I look (I was a secret smoker, so they didn’t know I quit anything, these compliments weren’t contrived attempts at support).

Between quitting smoking and my above new routine, I have never been happier and more confident. 

I hope this helps. I know I needed to find some instant gratification when I quit. Maybe some sort of routine could help you, too.

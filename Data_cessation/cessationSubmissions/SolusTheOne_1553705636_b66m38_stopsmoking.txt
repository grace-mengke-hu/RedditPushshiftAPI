2 months in. Trying to clean up other areas of my life, new diet has me jonesing hard.

I am a rotund man and I have noticed that the diet I'm on has me jonesing hard. Luckily, having quit smoking and now eating a restricted diet, I have no reason to go to gas stations (at least not inside) so I'm not afraid of a lapse. 

Has anyone else dealt with new found nicotine cravings when dieting?

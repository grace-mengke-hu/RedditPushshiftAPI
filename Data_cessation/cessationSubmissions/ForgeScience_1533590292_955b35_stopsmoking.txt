I can't work when I'm this angry

Day 7 and while the first week I was calm, today I can't control my anger. I think I've given up on getting any work done today, it's one thing to have a physical job (it's so easy to keep a clear mind when you are just moving your body) but as a systems engineer facing difficulties today I just physically can not handle it. I've taken 3 walks, meditated for 20 minutes in my office, listened to music etc. The only thing that will probably work is going home having some weed and doing an hour long workout (I'm looking forward to this so much). 

It's fucking impossible to be expected to be mentally productive every day when your brain just wants to explode.

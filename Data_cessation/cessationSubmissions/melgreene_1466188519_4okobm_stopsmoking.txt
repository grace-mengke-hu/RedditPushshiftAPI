1 month cig free and today is hard

I haven't had a cigarette for a whole month today after 17 years of smoking about half a pack a day, more when drinking. Until a couple days ago I was still proud every day about it. But the last couple days have just been hard again and I feel like it's inevitable I'll start again. It doesn't help that I work for a concert production company and we have a music festival going on right now... An environment where I would have very much enjoyed smoking in the past. I don't really talk to anyone about not smoking, so I'm writing it here as suggested by a quit smoking app I'm using. Reading all your posts are helpful. Congrats on being strong and thanks for sharing!

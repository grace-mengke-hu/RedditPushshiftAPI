Caved in after a month, feel like shit

I quit smoking one month ago after smoking 6-8 per day for a year. I had read Allen Carr's book and for a month I felt amazing, with only a few cravings here and there that I was able to overcome with minimal effort. Today, however, I had a terrible craving and instead of waiting for it to go away (which it would have in 10 minutes), I rushed outside and bought a pack. I was feeling depressed because I have finals going on and they aren't going as well as I had hoped, and I just really wanted a sweet sweet cigarette to take the pain away. When I took the first puff, I realized I wasn't enjoying it. After a month of no smoke in my lungs, that first puff felt like I was inhaling toxic fumes from a factory sewer or something. That is where I should have stopped, but instead I forced myself to finish the cigarette in the hopes that it would make me feel better. It didn't, and I felt even shittier by the time it was done. I did throw away the pack and the lighter right there and then, but I feel like the damage has been done. I have broken my streak, even though I had promised to myself I'd never put a cancer stick in my mouth ever again. I guess this is just a rant.

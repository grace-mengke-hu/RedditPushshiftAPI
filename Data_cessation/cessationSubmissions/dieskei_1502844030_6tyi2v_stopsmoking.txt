Being able to smell better is a blessing and a curse

I have recently caught whiffs of foul scents in both my car and house. This has surely cost me sex a time or two. After some deep cleaning, it has indeed just been the product of not picking up on some scents from heavy smoking. Lost love, but a cleaner house and car these days!

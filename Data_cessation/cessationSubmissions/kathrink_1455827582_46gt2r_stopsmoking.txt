Day 5 of my quit and worries about my smoking friends

Feeling good about not smoking for day five! I've tried quitting so many times before, but this feels different. My one worry is my gal pals. They all smoke and it's going to be really hard to sit with them and not light up. I love these friends and need them for my sanity, so what do I do??

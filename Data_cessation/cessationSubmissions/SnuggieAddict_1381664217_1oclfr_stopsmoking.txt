I went to a concert last night (Spoiler: Didn't smoke)

First rock concert since I stopped smoking. It was pretty awkward. People were either smoking cigarettes (nope), drinking booze (can't), or smoking pot (can't either). I felt like my hands were empty and felt very uncomfortable. 

DAE know what I'm talking about?

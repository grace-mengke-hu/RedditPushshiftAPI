18 hours in… Please, help make me WANT this.

As the title says, I'm eighteen hours in to my quit after being a smoker for nearly 14 years.

I have a major problem though. I genuinely don't *want* to quit. I enjoy smoking, a lot. I know all of the things I give up by smoking: money, a strong sense of taste & smell, lung capacity… I don't really mind all that much. Intellectually, of course I know I should quit and I even know I should *want* to quit but… I just don't.

I can't really explain because the logical part of my brain understands all the reasons why continuing to smoke isn't a great option. I don't have good reasons for why I enjoy smoking that can't be rebuked by any numerous responses. 

I'm just curious if any of the quitters here started in my shoes--quitting not because you wanted to but because you knew you needed to...

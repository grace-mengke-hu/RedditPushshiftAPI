HELP - Trying to repair the damage.

 
1 month and 1 day smoke-free.  If you knew me you would say “WOW, never thought you could do it.”  For 30 years I was totally focused on being a smoker and defended that choice with all the typical excuses. Ignoring the health issues because I could get run over by a bus on any given day.  Ignoring the financial issue because I would spend the money on food and/or weight loss supplements if I were a non-smoker.  You know, the typical defenses of a smoker.  I am sure I have tried to quit at least 20 times before - reverting back to the old excuses to being a smoker.  Over the years my family and social circle has changed from mainly smokers to mainly non-smokers which was my biggest reason to finally quit.  After reading Allen Carr’s book The Easy Way to Stop Smoking I actually couldn’t wait to quit and I did quit.  I am amazed.  There are still times where having a cigarette crosses my mind but now I think of all the reasons why I should not smoke and I focus on all the benefits I get as a non-smoker.  I have more energy now and believe it or not I feel less stressed. In an effort to keep my momentum going I am reaching out to anyone out there with suggestions on reversing some of the health damage smoking has done to me over the years.  Specifically I notice my skin is dry and in my opinion more aged than that of a non-smoker.  Another area I am focused on is dental as I have always struggled with gum disease and require trips to the dentist every 3 months.  Basically I am asking for any suggestions to keep me headed towards healthier habits as a non-smoker.

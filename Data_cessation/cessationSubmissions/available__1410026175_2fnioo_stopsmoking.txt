63 hours 55 minutes

I was smoking 2 packs a day Marlboro Reds, stepped down to 12 mg e liquid, and almost 64 hours later, I'm about to go get some 6 mg e liquid. I just figured if I was going to come here and ask for help, which I was so graciously given, I should also come here to say thank you and let you know with your help I am becoming an ex smoker!!

My first 7 minute  mile run in over a decade will be dedicated to r/stopsmoking, I appreciate all the help you gave me about 50 hours ago!

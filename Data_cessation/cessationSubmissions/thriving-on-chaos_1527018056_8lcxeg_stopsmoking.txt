My brain wants me to quit but I can't physically follow through..

I've been following this page for motivation to quit smoking.. You all are doing so wonderful and I hope someday in the near future, I will join the nonsmokers side of life.

I know how bad smoking is and I dont like anything about it. I want to quit so bad but when it comes time for a break, I don't even think about it, I just smoke and regret it. Every time. 

Any suggestions on something I can do that maybe I haven't thought of? I've tried ecigs, cold turkey, gum, support groups, phone apps and nothing works.. I know they would work if I tried harder to let them.. 

How do I mentally convince myself to not physically follow through?
 
10 years is enough. Please help me!

Make it a challenge!

I just remembered one trick I used at the beginning. 

I made a sort of achievements, like in games. I used Google Keep but any To Do app you like will work.

I just wrote down every single possible situation, in which the probability of loosing it were high. 
Now every time you find yourself in this kind of situation, instead of thinking of cigarette/ trying to resist, concentrate on how you are going to put the check mark and get this achievement once the situation ends. 

For me it looked something like that:

* [x] Do not smoke when depressed
* [x] Do not smoke when happy
* [x] Do not smoke when under stress
* [x] Do not smoke when enjoying some nice view
* [x] Do not smoke during USA trip in Nov.
* [x] Do not smoke when drinking
* [x] Do not smoke when drinking with a smoker
* [x] Do not smoke with Mike
* [x] Do not smoke for 24h
* [x] Do not smoke for 2 days
* [x] Do not smoke for a week
* [x] Do not smoke for 2 weeks
* [x] Do not smoke for a month
* [x] Do not smoke for 2 months
* [x] Do not smoke for 3 months
* [x] Do not smoke for 4 months
* [  ] Do not smoke for 365 Days

I know this thing helped me, but maybe I just like checklists :)

Day 3. Not my first attempt, but my first serious attempt.

Greetings,

It was due in part to this subreddit that I decided to make an appointment with my Doc to assist in my attempts to quit smoking.  

I had attempted to quit cold turkey probably 20 times. My longest run being 3 months without smoking, even then, looking back, I was cheating at times with singles, or bumming them off of co-workers.  

It was a mess for me, EVERY time I tried to quit. I'd turn into a complete fuck. I'd look for ANY little reason to pick a fight with my SO,  she was also trying to quit at the time (how supportive of me!)... That never turned out well. Sometimes I'd randomly snap at my kids... Blah.

There were so many posts on here about not feeling 'shame' for going to your doctor for help... I hadn't realized I was using that as my excuse to not go... So I went, and so far... It has been the best decision I've made.

With the medication I'm sitting here on day 3, haven't had a cigarette since just after midnight on Friday (Saturday morning?). I have to say the medication is helping... Or perhaps its a placebo effect, and I just think its helping. Either way... I haven't lost my patience, or started any shit. I haven't been an ass, and the cravings, though tough at times, pass on by... 

Thank you /r/stopsmoking/

I think I'm going to do it this time.

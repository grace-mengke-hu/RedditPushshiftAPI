Worst day ever. Big dissapointment

I had the worst day even and don't wanna sound like an attention whore but my instrument professor at the academy raged on me from the top of his voice without much reason, just to blow out on me. Cursed, and just harshly verbally assaulted me and questioned my career which had me almost in tears but I stood there without a shiver which is impossible for me and was able to continue to play knowing anything i say will only piss him off more than he was. Long post short, I went out, got pissed more partly for having to hold in everything I was thinking about and smoked two cigs without thinking. That was a great mistake and I feel so sorry bu it will not happen again.

Hope this didn't revert enough addiction back and all I want to achieve by posting this is to blow off my last valve which will hopefully help me not to smoke again and if you read this, thank you. If it annoyed you, I'm sorry, but it means a lot to m either way.

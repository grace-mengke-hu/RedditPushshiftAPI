Cost Benefit Analysis


Just posting a short message that tonight is the night. There have been a lot
of nights where I said the same thing but I'm ready to make this change in my
life. I read the Easy Way awhile ago and I was still, somehow, in denial about
the effects that smoking was having on me and what I actually got from it. 

I just need to remember I'm not giving anything up, I will only gain from 
this decision and any benefit that I think I get from smoking is purely an
illusion and stems from addiction, not from anything concrete. I've tried this
before but I think I've got the tools I need to finally break a 15 year long habit.

As an interesting side note, what prompted this was: on a car ride home from the mall
I was giving my wife a hard time about buying shoes impulsively and she made the point
that even if she only wore the shoes once she'd get more benefit from them than I would
from buying any number of cigarettes.

Wish me luck.

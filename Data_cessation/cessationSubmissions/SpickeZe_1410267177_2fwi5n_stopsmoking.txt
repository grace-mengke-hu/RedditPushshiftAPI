1st attempt at quitting

I am 3 days into my first attempt at quitting cigarettes.   My mind is playing tricks on me.   Most stories involve multiple tries before successfully quitting, so I am seriously fighting the mentality that since it is my first try, that I am doomed for failure this time and might as well have a smoke.

I know this is flawed logic, but it is very pervasive.

I guess what I am asking is if anybody had success on their first try, and if you did could you share your story.  I am having a lot of trouble at the moment, but the thought of going through the hell that was the last three days is demoralizing, so I really don't want to cave in.

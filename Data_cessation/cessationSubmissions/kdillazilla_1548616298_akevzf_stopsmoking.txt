Thank you

I’m  a little over month now; quit 12/24; I have a super crappy cold/upper respiratory infection and all I can think about is how much worse it would be if I was still smoking. I’m still hesitant to do things I would normally do; run a bunch of errands, hang out with some friends who still smoke, go out drinking, go inside of a gas station instead of just paying at the pump- but I’m not afraid that I’m too weak to do those things anymore. I’m just hesitant :) anyway- thanks for keeping me motivated- thanks for sharing your stories and please know that a lot of y’all keep me going through each day! Keep up the good work and thanks for being a community

Should I reset?

Last night I was letting a band use my rehearsal spot to, well, rehearse. In return, the drummer says, "Do you smoke weed?" "Goodness, yes," I reply.

When the joint makes it around to me I take a puff and I get a super harsh burning in the back of my throat. "Cough cough, this is some strong shit man!" I exclaim. To which he responds, " Not really, it's just a spliff."

Does this count as smoking? I only took one hit, and I definitely would have passed had I known that there was tobacco in there, and menthol at that.

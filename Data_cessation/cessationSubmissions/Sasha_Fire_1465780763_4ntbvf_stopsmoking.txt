Advice on Vapes?

I usually relapse when drinking and was thinking of taking a non nicotine vape out with me to avoid the usual relapse cycle. I was wondering about any and all things vape really, I don't know anything about them or which ones are better for what reasons. Thanks in advance for your experienced advice on them :)

**Update -** I got a vape it's an istick 40w with a smaller chamber? It's not supposed to go higher than 15 on the battery for anyone more savvy with these and I got menthol flavour. I am so happy with my choice to get a vape, I can't even relay how much better I felt immediately. Thank you everyone for your advice and conversation around vaping, I appreciate the support network here so much! :)

I have quit before for 10 months, and I recently failed. I've been smoking for 2 months now, but let's go again !!

I have quit before for about 10 months. I never thought I could do it, considering I've been a smoker for roughly 8 years before it. But I did. I know I can do it again. I have started again about 2 months ago, unfortunately my reddit account can trace it back. 

However, I am vouching publicly here, the reason for this sub's existence, so I wanted to say it out loud. Not looking for karma, but for encouragement, so tomorrow, I will hopefully wake up to a couple upvotes and a couple encouragement comments, because I am serious I want to go for a smokeless life it again.

LET'S GO, from ALL my heart! I have thought about it for the past two hours, actually. We're all struggling here but I know it's beneficial for me and for all of you, for all of us. I do remember how good it was to be smoke free. Personally, I should and I will be cutting down alcohol too, at least for started, I already know the devilish nature of it when quitting smoking.

From all my heart,

500 not smoked!

My app tells me that I've not smoked 500 cigs since my quit date! I can honestly say that I don't really crave them anymore - occasionally I'll hit a trigger and the thought will cross my mind but it's getting easier and easier to shrug it off and move on with my day. I still get days where I feel a bit depressed, or I get mad at stuff quicker than i used to, but overall I'm feeling positive that I made the right choice, I won't go back to smoking again. My life is definitely better without it. Anyone out there having doubts - have faith in yourself. You CAN do this and it IS worth it. Keep on keeping on folks.

I just can't seem to get past a couple days without having "just one" please help!

I want to quit, I really do. But every time I go two or three days without smoking I'll see someone outside of the library or walking down the street having a smoke. I'll think to myself "don't do it, you don't need one or even want one, even as I'm asking them to bum one. Or I'll be watching t.v. and get a craving, throw on a jacket and hit the corner store for a single, the whole time telling myself I don't need it.

Any advice as to what can I do to stop myself from doing this?

Back and quitting again day 7

I quit for 90 days this year, went to Vegas and decided I could smoke there and quit when I got on the plane to come back home.  How wrong that was all that hard work this year and within a week I was back to a pack or more a day.   
I got a pretty bad cold last week and I decided enough was enough and I quit smoking again, and now I got seven days an I feel great.   I don't understand why I ever thought I needed to smoke again. Those two months I smoked I never felt as good as I have the last week, so much more energy, better smells and taste,  and I don't stink.

I learned never let your guard down, and think before you ever take another drag, do I want to go back to that life style.

Day 4 - Feeling Good

I think nicotine is completely out of my system. I woke up feeling blissful this morning, blasted Skrillex and shook my ass like a crazy dead mouse. Then, I took a cold shower - this means a lot, because I hadn't been able to tolerate cold water on my skin except for my hands in months. Although I still have the smoker's cough and my lungs are slightly itchy, I have never felt this great in the past few months. 

Craving hits me only when I see someone I know smoking - it brings me back the memories of smoking with that person. 

Overall, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, and I'm feeling good.

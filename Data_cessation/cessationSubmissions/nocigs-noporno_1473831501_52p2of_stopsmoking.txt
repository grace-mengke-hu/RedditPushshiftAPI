207 days down...

Had a dream i bought a pack.  I Felt guilty in the dream.  Change of season is gonna be a hard trigger for me.  I also been toying with the idea of getting back into it because i like the habit of going out side for a smoke and timing things around it.  Which is insane.  Why after all this time would i think it would be a good idea to smoke?  Its never and will never be a good idea to start that crazy ass life style again.  Slowly killing my self.  Stealing my energy.  Staining my teeth.  Adding wrinkles to my skin.  Adding more anxiety and panic to my life.  Worrying if i smell.  which you always do if your a smoker even if you don't realize it your self.  The money god damn the money.  Havent spent 2490.  Thats fucked.  I smoked for 9 years.  I could have and should have a lot more money but i dont because i smoked like a jack ass.  Here to getting to a year and the rest of my life but if not i really hope i dont slip because that would really be dumb...

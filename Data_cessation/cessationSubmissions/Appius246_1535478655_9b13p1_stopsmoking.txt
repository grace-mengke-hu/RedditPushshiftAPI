Stopping but not really.

This is going to be the 7th full day of me quitting in 3 hours. I must admit I am vaping but still find the occasional need to smoke. Went from 6 smokes the first day to 3. To none for a while and back to three yesterday and three today. I just feel so exhausted I need it. Is this okay and something I should stop beating myself up over?

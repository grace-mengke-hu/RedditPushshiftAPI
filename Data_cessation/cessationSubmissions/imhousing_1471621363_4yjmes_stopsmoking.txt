Quitting American Spirits vs Camels

Just wanted to add my findings on this.  I stopped smoking for a year 3 years ago when i was smoking Camels.  The first week was easy cuz i had the flu, the next 3 were hell for withdrawal symptoms.  When I started back up I switched over to American Spirits because I always liked them but didn't want to pay extra.  I figured if I was going to smoke I was going to smoke what I wanted.  

This time quitting has been much easier.  I keep letting my anxiety get the best of me over the past 3 months when I seriously started trying again.  But besides slipping during these personal issues, I find the withdrawal symptoms to be negligible if not all together easy.  

Besides a brief (albeit strong) craving when I'm in a situation I'd normally smoke there is none of the anger/emotional flux/increased appetite/oral fixation I'd experienced when I quit Camels.  

Am I crazy or are the chemicals that American Spirit claims is in other traditional tobacco really so powerful that they make quitting a hell ride instead of just fighting the urge?

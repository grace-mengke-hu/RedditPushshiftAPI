Quit smoking for last 212 Days

Wow, it really feels good. I had been smoking free for 212 day 23 hrs:00 min: 06 second (Kwit app statistics). I have been chain smoker for last ten years (Yeah i started in june of 2006). Quit it many times, but this time I had promised myself that I would never touch that cancer causing stick again. Also, this is all done without any medication. Anybody can do that. I did not want to be habitual to anything to quit smoking so I just did it.......Here is my story http://healthynews24.com/quit-smoking/

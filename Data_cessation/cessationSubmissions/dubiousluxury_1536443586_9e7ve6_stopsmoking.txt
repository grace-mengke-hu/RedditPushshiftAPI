21 days tobacco free. People smoking look soooooo "stupid" now.

I know this sounds judgemental. It is. It is also helping me reaffirm my commitment to stay away from those shitty cancer sticks.

People stand out in the rain on breaks from work huddled together. I was one of them for 30 years, so I don't feel to bad about my attitude of superiority. 

What a stupid, expensive, deadly habbit.

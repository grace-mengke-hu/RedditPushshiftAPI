I slipped really bad today, I just want to talk to someone

I’ve been smoking a little over a year, I started last February. It probably took me until the end of summer before I had a half a pack a day habit. I recently cut that down to just two a day by having my mom ration out my cigs to me, one in the morning and one at night. But I bought a pack on top of what I’ve been having her ration out to me, and I heard where she had hid the cigs and I actively went and searched for the cigs and smoked the rest of them within an hour. I’ve had 8 today, after doing so well for the past week. I just want to pm somebody who has been clean for a long while and ask them what truly made them stick to their guns, because I’ve realized that I truly don’t want to quit, and that’s scary. That’s how hooked I am. My face is three colors, yellow, gray, and red, in no particular order. I am unhealthy as shit, but I don’t want to quit. But I also know I need to quit. Cigarettes are not doing anything for me except making me look and feel disgusting.

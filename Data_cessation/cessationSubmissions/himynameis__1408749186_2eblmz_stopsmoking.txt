For reading material, a book with great reviews on Amazon and on reddit is Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking

I have never smoked in my life but I have heard of this book through reddit and a lot of commenters have said great things about it. I know of this subreddit and thought it would be a good idea to let the people here know about it as it may help in your goal. Again, the book is [Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155) and here is an Amazon.com link to it. I hope it helps.

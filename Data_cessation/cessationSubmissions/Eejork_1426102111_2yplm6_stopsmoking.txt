My first day

I don't know if I should post this somewhere else, but I'm kind of looking for advice.

Yesterday, after a long time of pondering about it, I took up running and to my surprise, I couldn't run for shit. I was only able to run for about 2km before I felt little pain in my lungs and that's when I realised I should quit smoking.

So I have motivation to stop smoking but I need help for when I have the urge to smoke. I've been smoking for about 4 years and it has became a ritual that I do whenever I go out. Now it feels strange to do anything outside without grabbing a cigarette, but I'm hoping the fine folk of /r/stopsmoking could give me some advice as in what to do when I get the need to smoke.

Thank you for reading and any advice is welcome :)

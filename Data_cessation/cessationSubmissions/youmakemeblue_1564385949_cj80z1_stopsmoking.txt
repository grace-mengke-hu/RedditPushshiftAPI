Should I take Nicotine Lozenges or should I just quit cold turkey?

Sorry, this is more of a question than a story but I think I can get advice here. I’ve been a smoker since I was 14. I used to smoke really heavily until I was 15.(6 cigarettes sometimes 10 a day) I am now 16 and smoke at least, 3 cigarettes a day. I really like smoking because it relieves a lot of my stress but it hurts my lungs and I’m too ashamed to smile because I’ve lost a tooth and my teeth look horrid. Recently though, I was diagnosed with pre diabetes and was told that smoking cigarettes was probably one of the main reasons it had happened. Anyways, he prescribed me these Nicotine pills but I’ve read that they can give you mouth cancer and the side affects sound really scary. I’ve tried to cold turkey but that would only work if I knew there was no way I’d have access to them or I was kept busy all day. I just want to know what people think and if you guys have any tips. It will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.

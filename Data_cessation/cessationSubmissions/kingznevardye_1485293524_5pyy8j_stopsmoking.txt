24 Days - Spouse and I

Everyone here can do it. One thing I read a lot is don't use nicotine patches. I'd like to add that I used them for 3 days then dropped them as well. My spouse used them for 22 and dropped them completely. 

My only point is don't abandon any type of aid that is out there. Surely using the patch is still an addiction to nicotine, but you ARE NOT smoking. This is a million times better than smoking. It also eases you into the mental state of leaving nicotine behind. Just my two cents. 

Stay strong everyone!!!

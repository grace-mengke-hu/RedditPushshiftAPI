Nicorette Mini-Lozenges are amazing ... so why can't I exclusively use them?

I've tried various methods of quitting over the years and have come to the conclusion that the only thing that will actually work for me is Nicorette's Mini-Lozenges. I've gone days and weeks just using the Lozenge when I have a craving and it works like a charm. I don't even think about going and buying smokes when I use them.

So why is it that I can't just use them exclusively? I always find myself wafting back to cigs eventually. Do I have to eliminate all social activities? No drinking? It's driving me nuts.

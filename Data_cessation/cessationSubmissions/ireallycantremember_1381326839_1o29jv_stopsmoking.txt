I have no words - 1 YEAR!!

Actually, I take that back. To everyone who is sitting there, *thinking I can't do it*, you are wrong. **You can quit**. I can't believe its been a year, its really been easy. My husband even still smokes, and I still have no craving or desire to smoke again. 

I remember subscribing to /r/stopsmoking at least two years ago. I would see people's milestones and think that it would be impossible for me to get there. After smoking for almost 20 years, I had enough.  I quit cold turkey and life is grand. You can do it.

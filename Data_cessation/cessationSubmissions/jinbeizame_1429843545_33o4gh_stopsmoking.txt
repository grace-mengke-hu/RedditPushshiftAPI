It can be done.

Hey guys. I just wanted to pop in and let people know that although it is SUPER GODDAMN AWFUL for the first while, this is definitely something you can get through. 

Working out, gum, and coffee were really helpful for me, as were breathing exercises and a bit of therapy to help with various stressors. 

You can do it, though! Be strong!

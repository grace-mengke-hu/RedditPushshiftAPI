My dad bet me I couldn't go a year without smoking. If I win I get $1000.

Hello fellow recovering smokers. At a festival with my family in August my dad bet me $1000 I couldn't go September 1st, 2013 - September 1st, 2014 without smoking a cigarette. Of course, he made this bet while smoking a cig himself but I digress!

Well, on September 4th I smoked a cig. [I'm so disapointed in myself.](http://i.imgur.com/AMVbgi3) Aside from that one slip, I haven't had a single cigarette or e-cig and I FEEL GREAT! There are still moments that I really, really want one. Around 5:35 PM Monday - Thursday specifically ha! Other than that though, lunch hours are getting easier and drinking without smoking is getting easier.

I'm really happy that my quitting is going better than I had hoped. I'm on Vyvanse for ADD and the stims make me want to chain smoke. I was really close to a pack a day. 

Though I've been pretty quiet on this sub I just wanted to say that reading the posts really helps me get through the cravings. You guys rock. Keep on keepin' on.

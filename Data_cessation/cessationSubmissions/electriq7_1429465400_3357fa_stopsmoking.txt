Apathetic about quitting

I've done something like 42 days now and I'm proud of myself for that, but at the same time I also feel like its easy for me to devalue not smoking.

I smoked for about 12 years off and on, I was mostly a social smoker, I went periods of time without smoking at all, sometimes 4 - 6 months at a time. At various points I smoked more seriously, on a regular, almost daily basis and thats what I was doing right before I quit. Almost all of my friends who smoked quit long before I did, they were all more serious consistent smokers than I, and I think there was something about them seeing themselves as a smoker which made the decision not to smoke more black and white whereas for myself, with the on again off again, sometimes take it sometimes leave it, it was like I woke up one day and realized it was 12 years later and I was still going, even if just haphazardly.

Today I am having cravings again, I feel confident that I can use the different tools I have to get myself through but at the same time I think, it would be so easy for me to slide off the wagon in a moment of apathy, a thought that I can just have one and then not again for several months (I know this because I have done it). I suppose I am writing this post because this thought scares me, on some level I really don't want to keep going back to this. The health risks scare me but I'm able to block this out of my mind frighteningly well. The level of social intolerance towards smoking is pretty powerful as a deterrent but so too is my reminiscing of how I loved to smoke to day dream, to have a moments contemplation, the smell, the taste, the feeling. I'm not trying to glorify smoking, I am trying to be as honest as possible with myself and that includes watching myself trying to find a way to justify it. That won't happen today though, writing this has helped.

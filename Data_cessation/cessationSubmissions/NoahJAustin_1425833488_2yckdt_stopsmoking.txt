Birthday party

Hey hey! Last night my amazing wife threw me a surprise birthday party at a local restaurant for my 30th. A lot of my friends and family were there, most of whom smoke. Needless to say, I had a few drinks and was worried going into the evening that I'd break and smoke. Not so! I made it through and am feeling great. Got some great support both here and at home, so I'm still feeling like I can do this. You guys are great, congrats on wherever you are in your journey.

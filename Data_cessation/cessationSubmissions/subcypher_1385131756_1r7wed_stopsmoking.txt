Cigarette free for over a year now...

I started smoking a month after my 18th birthday. I was at a party and some people went outside to smoke. I followed because I really liked one of the girls. Yes, I started smoking for a girl. Cliche, I know. What's worse is that it didn't work out with her, let alone the smokes.

Over the years I smoked filters, non-filters, cigars, and cigarillos. I smoked several different brands in several different amounts. I smoked regulars, lights, menthols, and combos. At one point I was up to two packs per day, sometimes three on bad nights. Never less than five packs per week. I smoked for a few months shy of 18 years. I'm 36 now, 37 in the spring.

A while back I had decided to start losing weight. That started the ball rolling on cleaning up my entire life. One day, it just clicked that I didn't like the smoke anymore. I didn't like the taste, the smell, the feeling in my lungs, or the way I felt overall. All I wanted was the motion, the menthol, and the nicotine. And I probably didn't even want the nicotine anymore. I decided in November of 2012 to buy an ecig. I started out on a Blu, but didn't care for it. I bought a MicroLite from Totally Wicked and started mixing my own menthol. I puffed on that for roughly six months. One day I realized that I had left it in the glove box of my car for nearly three weeks and decided to give that up as well. Eventually this led to me also giving up drinking.

I just hope I quit in time...

Tomorrow is day 1

I just smoked the last cigarette in my pack. I live two doors down from a convenience store which is what always seems to get me. I have more quit attempts under my belt than I care to admit at 28 years old. I know I'm ready to do this but I have always managed to let myself get tricked into buying  "one more pack" or "just while I'm drinking" and that cycle goes on and on. I also have stopped drinking which is something that is a *HUGE* trigger for wanting  a cigarette for me. I'm doing this for a number of reasons; health, financial, personally wanting to and to support a loved one. I feel like making this little statement here will help me be more accountable to myself and my  actions. So, hello and here's to the next step in my life.

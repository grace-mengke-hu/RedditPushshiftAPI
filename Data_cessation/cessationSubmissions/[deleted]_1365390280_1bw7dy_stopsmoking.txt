Finally and officially quitting forever!

I would quit for about a week or 2, and keep it to "only smoking when drinking" but I would always get hooked again. 

now, I will never smoke again. Plus, the girl who i'm working on making things happen with doesn't like smoking. Double points! 

I honestly feel fine so far. It's been a day and a half. woo woo!

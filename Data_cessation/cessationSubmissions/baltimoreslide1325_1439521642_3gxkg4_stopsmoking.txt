3 week success blues

I have read others on this forum say that 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months are points to pay attention to or points that could be hard.  
I'm a day shy of three weeks and feeling the first real craving I've had for what seems like a while.  
It's honestly hardly bad at all; I'm mainly just a bit fatigued and annoyed.
I've had an annoying week but can't tell if I'm craving because I'm annoyed or annoyed because I'm craving!   
It doesn't matter--it's not the kind of craving I'd act on. 
I can feel the sinuses in my face healing--it's weird and hard to describe, but hey, healing! Maybe the thrice-yearly sinus infections will stop now.  
I will power through this annoying day,  
and then tomorrow I get to give myself some three-week success reward (not sure what it is yet--maybe a new book and a beer?).  
  
For anyone else facing an annoying but successful day: join me in not smoking today?
Anyone else reaching 3 weeks and rewarding themselves with something fun?
  
(p.s. I mentioned in an earlier post that I was on the lowest level of patches (7 mg) for part of the day every day, but I've been off them now a week, so I'm nicotine free! I honestly did not notice the difference.)

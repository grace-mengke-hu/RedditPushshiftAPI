I'm a lurker here, but today I broke.

Reading everything through here and a few other subs, I finally mustered it up to quit.

I made it five days without a smoke, cold turkey.

Last night, I learned my girlfriend of a year and a half has been cheating on me.

It might be a second until I come back, I don't want it to be, but I'll be damned if I didn't go running right back to the smokes - I didn't know what to do.

You're all so awesome and supportive of one another, and I hope to rejoin your ranks soon. Stay strong everyone!

Best I've felt this far into the process - skin problems though, and questions

I'm breaking out a lot around my mouth and chin... I have always thought that "mouth area acne" is due to some sort of imbalance of the hormones but I'm concerned that it's from the quit.  Could this be true?  It's the only real problem I'm having thus far.  Some irritability and some major cravings at night. Other than that, I feel great :)

Thanks in advance!

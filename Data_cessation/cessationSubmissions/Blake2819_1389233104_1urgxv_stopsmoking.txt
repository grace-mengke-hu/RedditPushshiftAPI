They are poison. That's all they are. They are just poison.

Almost to day 4. I've "quit" four, maybe five times? Hell, I'm only 22. I've been smoking around a pack or so a day since I was a halfway through being 18.

I'm drunk right now and I'm jonesing so hard for a bogue. Even the butt of one. Just something to tide me over.

But I wont smoke.  I'm saying fuck that. I was a broke college kid for the last year or so and I did some stupid shit for cigarettes. I'd pick them out of my garbage at my house when I was too broke to buy them. I would grab the ones my fraternity brothers tossed away just to get the tobacco in my system.

Fuck this, man. Who does this, other than an addict? They are poison. I feel better for maybe 30 seconds if I smoke one, but feel like shit for the rest of the day. They. are. poison.

I will not let my addiction control me. I have been to my corner store 5 times in the last three days. I stand there, the man who knows me grabs a pack and I say "Not today, no smokes."

Fuck this shit. I'm tired of "quitting." Let me Quit.

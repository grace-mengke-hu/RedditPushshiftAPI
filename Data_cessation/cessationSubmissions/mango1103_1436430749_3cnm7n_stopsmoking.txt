18, been smoking since 15, can't bring myself to quit

I think about how much I want it to be my last time every cigarette I smoke, my lungs hurt after almost every time, I tell myself I'm not going to be a smoker soon but I can't find it in myself to quit. My mom always has cigarettes to steal, all of my freinds smoke, I don't even buy my own cigarettes and smoke way too much. I feel like its killing me every drag but I just don't stop for some reason, I have no idea how to overcome it. I know I can just not smoke anytime but I never stop, and If I do it's only a few days and then I go into it hard. I don't smoke anywhere near a pack a day, but 5 a day is commn and even then my lungs hurt after after my last few during the night. I don't even know why I'm posting this considering anything anyone says probably wont affect my decisions at all, but I'd just like to share an experience.

Finally decided to quit smoking.

It's been the first 24 hours, not going absolutely insane quite yet but starting to feel extremely strong urges to light up. Just thought about how i can never have a stoge after a big meal or after a stressful day of work and got kinda sad. 

Hopefully many more hours and days to go!

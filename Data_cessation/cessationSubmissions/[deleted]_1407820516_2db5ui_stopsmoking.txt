A New Page For Me

Hey all,    

This is a new page for me.  I've abandoned my old account as it's easy to identify me IRL.  

I've decided that this sub will be my first post of the new me.  

Let me tell you, I hate smoking. I've done it for too long. I hate that it zapps my energy, I hate the way I feel after smoking, and I HATE that it's taken control of my life.  

This is where I take it back. This is where I start a new. This is where I tell my stupid temptations to "FUCK OFF" I control my life.  

Moving forward I will need your help. I will tell you about how I made it 1 day, and 2 days, and 1 week, and 1 month, and 1 year.  

I will tell you about my bad days and my good.  

As much as I will be in the driver's seat, I will look to you for help.  

This is a revolution (even if just personal)! This is a change! This is the start of something great.  

For all those still debating the decision to quit, let me tell you... It cant come soon enough!  

This is the time to rise up! This is the time to take charge! This is the time to kick that shit to the curb!  

Thank you all for listening to my rant. There will be more to come.  

I'll see you all on the battle field! Let's kick some ass!  

Sincerely,

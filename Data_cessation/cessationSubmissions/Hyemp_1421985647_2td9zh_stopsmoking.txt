This time, it is real.

So I know many of you here have varying thoughts on badge resets. I'm not going to reset mine. I quit on Dec. 31st and since then I have had 2 smokes - one drunk, one sober - both time I felt gross and actually ill from them. it certified the fact that this time its real. I feel better, mentally, physically. I have another tough challenge coming at me next week - a friend of mine who is moving out here who smokes is staying with me for a while, but I look forward to any challenge. Stay strong out there folks, this is a war we can all win.

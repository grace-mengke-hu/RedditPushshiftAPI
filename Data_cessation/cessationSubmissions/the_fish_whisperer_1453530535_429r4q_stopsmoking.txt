So over it

I don't know when the change happened but I know for certain that I will never pick up a cigarette again. Nicotine is nothing but addiction with no upside.
I quit for a year before and somehow on that attempt, I knew I could fall back into the trap and I did. Then I was an ex smoker, now I am a non smoker. I don't need this sub any more, but I am going to stay because it helped me so much and I hope I can help someone else along the way.

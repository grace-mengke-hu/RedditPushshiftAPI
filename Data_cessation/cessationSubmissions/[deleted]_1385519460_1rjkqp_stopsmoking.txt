Day 1 - It's time

Hello everyone, I have been a smoker since the age of 18, and I am now 24. 6 years, 6 damn years. With absolutely nothing to show except a bad cough, health risks and a horrible smell. Well, I want to change that. I have tried in the past, the longest I have made was 5 days. I broke due to drinking. I am now 10 months alcohol free, so that's one less obstacle to get in the way of my smoke free goal. My greatest enemy is my addiction/myself. I know I my addiction is gonna try to get me back into smoking, but I am going to give this 110 percent. I never wanna go through with this again, that's what I am gonna keep telling myself. I never wanna try to quit again. It's so hard quitting, and I don't wanna go through it all again. This is my time. I'm ready! My biggest fear/challenge will probably be mornings, boredom and social situations. Any tips for those? I've read Easy Way, though it didn't work for me, it did put everything into perspective for me. So I guess in a way it did work.

Looking for a "last cigarette" song. Any recommendations?

I got one left in the pack, gonna have a beer or two and attempt to quit after this last one. 11 years I've been a smoker. I have a couple of songs that mean a lot to me but I'd rather not have them associated with smoking. Any recommendation is appreciated.

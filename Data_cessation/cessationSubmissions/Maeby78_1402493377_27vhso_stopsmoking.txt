Day Seven!

I made it a week.  

I hurt.  My husband caught me whimpering and crying in the middle of the night.  I wasn't crying because I wanted a cigarette, I was crying because I was so mad at myself for wanting one so bad.  The addiction really messes with your head and your emotions. 

I made it through that night. I'll make it through more.

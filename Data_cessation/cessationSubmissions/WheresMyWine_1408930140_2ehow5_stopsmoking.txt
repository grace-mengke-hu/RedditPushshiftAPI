Quit (again) today, for good this time

I've been an on again off again smoker for 16 years.  I started up again in March of this year.  I've been lurking this sub for about 2 weeks now and I made the decision to quit for good today.  Smoking has caused my heart to beat irregularly, my lungs to ache and my kid to tell me that I stink.  So, here I go again!

Two Weeks and some questions!

It's been 2 weeks since I quit and I do have some questions.

1. Muscle spasms/twitching. I assume I need to see a doctor for this. Especially since I almost tossed some poor girl's laptop at her face (I work in IT). Is this normal?

2. Depression. I've seen a lot of people on here talk about post-cessation depression. I know what to do with it, I just don't know if it gets worse (I really hope it doesn't).

3. Miscellaneous. Does anyone else know what I should be looking for?

Thanks again for all the examples and support, guys!

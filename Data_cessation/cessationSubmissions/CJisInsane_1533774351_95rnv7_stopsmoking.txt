For those who have quit with using the patch how did step 3 go?

I'm currently 12 days into step 1 and have questions. The purpose of the patch is to ween yourself off nicotine. So how does step 3 go? Using a 7 mg patch for 2 weeks and then suddenly having no nicotine at all seems like a huge jump to me. I'm concerned about relapsing after ending the program. For those that have used the patch how did it feel?

I finally WANT to quit

My wife always said that I’ll only quit smoking if I really want to - no one can make you stop smoking. It has to be a personal choice. And I think she was right. I never wanted to quit smoking. I loved it. 

Until this weekend. It was the first time in a while where I was at a party full of non-smokers. Going outside to get my fix felt alienating all of a sudden. What am I doing out here? Is this cigarette honestly adding value to my life experience? 

I felt something click in my mind this weekend. I just think about it differently now. I told my wife I’m done, threw my pack out, and I’ve currently got about 2 days under my belt. 

This weekend I’m going to a bachelor party, which will be hard. But I know I can do it. 

Best wishes to you all.

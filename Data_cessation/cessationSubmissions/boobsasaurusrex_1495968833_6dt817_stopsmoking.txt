It's getting harder?

I'm 53 days and 9 hours clean. I've not smoked 1067.8 cigarettes. I've save $347. All of this makes me so proud. 
But why do I feel like it is getting harder to overcome daily cravings rather than easier? I still get multiple insanely strong cravings per day and it is harder than hell to not go and buy a pack. I'm not going to lie to myself, if I was around someone else that smoked, I would have bummed one (or more) by now. 
Any and all tips or stories appreciated. I don't want to fail, but thinking of that first drag off a freshly lit cig has me weak as hell.

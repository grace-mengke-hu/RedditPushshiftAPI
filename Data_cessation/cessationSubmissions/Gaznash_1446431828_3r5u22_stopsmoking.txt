I quit smoking exactly 1 week ago

So I moved to the UK for University just a few weeks back and due to a combination of money issues and motivation to quit smoking I stopped buying tobacco. Back home, because cigarettes are cheap I would smoke a lot but here I managed to not smoke but I think of smoking all the time and there's not a lot that can take my mind off it. After I have a study session I feel like I wanna have a smoke, all my friends back home smoke as well and  I'm afraid the peer pressure that got me into smoking will get me back.

Any advice on how I can stay away?

It's only been an hour, but I'm sticking to it

Hey guys, I came to this sub for moral support and in reading through some of the posts and comments I can tell I've come to the right spot. 

I'm 28 and took my first drag at a very early age, below 10. My older sister told me it was cool. I am not blaming her in the slightest, that's just how it happened. I didn't become a full fledged smoker until I was of legal age, and have kept up a pack-a-day habit for a solid ten years. My dad smoked for 32 years and quit cold turkey, with 3 still left in the pack. He's been smoke free since 1999. He had developed some emphysema which completely went away after he smoked. I got sick earlier this year and developed bronchitis on top of pneumonia. It would not have gotten so bad had I not been a smoker. After talking with a coworker tonight, I decided to quit. Longest I've gone in the past is one week. I'm very stubborn and I know I can do it if I set my mind to it. I want to be like my dad, and be proud of myself. He may not even be here today if he hadn't quit. 

Sorry that was kind of long but, yeah, you know the emotions you go through.

First day of the rest of my life

Started Chantix a week ago. Yesterday was the last day I was permitted to smoke. I had a very intimate goodbye with my last cigarette last night. All is going well with Chantix, no depression, hallucinations or nightmares. We'll see what happens now that I am on 2mg per day. I'm 23, been smoking a pack a day for about 5 years now. I was able to quit for a year's time(cold turkey), two years ago when I was dating a non smoker and not hanging out with my friends, who all smoke. 

Now, I am dating a lovely young woman who smokes and lives with family who all smoke. I have given up on trying to get friends to quit with me. You have to do it for yourself. It seems like my girlfriend isn't ready yet either and I am okay with that. She is going to try to pull back (she smokes less than I did on average anyway) and I respect and appreciate that.

One thing that I feel is worth mentioning is what I learned when I was able to quit. People don't use the word sobriety when talking about those who have quit smoking. They should. While nicotine may not be as addictive as heroin, is it chemically and habitually addictive, no doubt. Every single day when I was sober I thought about cigarettes and how I would enjoy smoking one. That's when I realized that sobriety is merely the next stage of addiction. Sobriety is not a solution or an ending but a continual daily struggle. However, it is a fight you are winning. Do not become comfortable in your sobriety and let your guard down; as soon as you do the addiction will win.

Good luck with your fight

Update: I've been on 2mg for 2 days now. Everything is going well. The Chantix isn't causing any unwanted side effects. Very happy about that. That and the fact it was free through my insurance!

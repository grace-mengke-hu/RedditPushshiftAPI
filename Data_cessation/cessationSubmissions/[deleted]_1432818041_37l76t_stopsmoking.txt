Essential Oils & Quitting Smoking - Any Experiences?

Kind of a strange question/topic here: just wondering if anyone has experimented with essential oils (both in general and for help quitting smoking specifically). 

I recently purchased a bunch of essential oils from a local holistic health center (yeah, it's a bit of a pyramid scheme, but I went for it anyway). The person who did my consultation sold me Black Pepper essential oil on the premise that it somehow helps manage/reduce cravings for nicotine when ingested internally. (There's a few articles about it on the web, but I have no basis on which to evaluate their authenticity/validity). 

I've been taking black pepper oil (in "veggie caps" that I fill with a few drops) for the past few days when I have a craving. Not sure if it's actually doing anything or if it's just a placebo effect (even if it's the latter, I'll take it!). 

Anybody else ever try this?

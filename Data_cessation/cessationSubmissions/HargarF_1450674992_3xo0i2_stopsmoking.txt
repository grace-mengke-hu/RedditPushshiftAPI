One week!

It's been one week today, and it's actually starting to get easier. No more phyisical withdrawal, just those little moments where I forget that I've quit and reach for a cigarette but realize I don't smoke anymore and I feel kind of weird and good at the same time.
And I made it through 2 nights of drinking without smoking, which I thought was going to be impossible!

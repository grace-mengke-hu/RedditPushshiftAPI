almost 2 days cold turkey, is non-nicotine e-cigs bad to help?

i mean solely for the purpose of an oral fixation. im trying not to make cravings go away by taking a lil dip or e-cigs with regular amounts of nicotine in them. 

basically would it be still "good" to cope with quitting if i used e-cigs that dont have nicotine in them at all?

hello everyone,
i finally decided that it's time for me to stop smoking for the 5th time i failed each time after 2 days or less but this time i survived for the 5th day it isn't easy my whole body is itchy and i feel empty i used smoke a pack everyday since i was 16 and it was a daily routine i never ever thought that i would stop smoking but i started feeling that i need to stop before the worst happens 
i will gladly accept any advice cause it hasn't been easy for me am losing my mind 

p.s -i don't usually post on Reddit

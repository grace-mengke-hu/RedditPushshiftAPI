Day 78

I have GERD. And when I was smoking I threw up probably 3-5 times a day. Now that I am not smoking I throw up maybe once a week. I can already tell the difference in my health. Also when I am at the gym I dont get as winded when doing long cardio sessions. Overall quitting has been the best thing for my health. I am on day 78 I am still wearing a 14mg patch and chew 2mg nicotine gum. I dont really ever want to give up the gum but probably will. I like the sensation of nicotine in my body just not the health risks associated with smoking.

What improvements have you noticed after quitting?

Sorry if it’s been asked before, but I’m preparing to quit and I’m curious about what ways you all have felt better after quitting. I’m specifically wondering if your energy levels really increased. Also, any other lesser known ways in which you’ve felt better would be appreciated.

Sitting in front of a pack of cigarettes I just bought.. 62 days without a smoke

Im depressed. My boyfriend said that last night that he thinks I'm depressed. I missed a work party last night and I skipped work today. I've never felt so sad I just want the feeling to go away. I know that if I smoke I will go back to who I was. No telling how long this feeling will last if I stay quit. My life is a waste of time if I spend it feeling like this. Anyone been here before? What's the right thing to do?

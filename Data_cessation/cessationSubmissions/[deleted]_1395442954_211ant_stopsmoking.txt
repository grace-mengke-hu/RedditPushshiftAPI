New to the sub, tomorrow is the day!

I can't quit, because I am pregnant. I'm smoking probably 2 packs a day (eek!) and I didn't even realize until today when I bought a pack at 11,am and have 2 left. But I can seriously cut back! I'm going to go hour by hour, then the day after, hour and a half by hour and a half, until I'm down to 2,or 3 a day. I'm pretty excited, but then again, I'm all nicotined-up right now, and it's easy to say 'I'm through!' when you're not actually withdrawaling.

My toughest problem is that once I get it in my head that I want a cigarette--not even a physical craving--I have to have one. And I can't stop thinking about it no matter what I do, until I give in. Any idea how to combat my own thoughts?

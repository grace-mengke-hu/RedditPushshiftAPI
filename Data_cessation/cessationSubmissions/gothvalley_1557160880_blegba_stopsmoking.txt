Day one, 2 hours in. Just popped my first piece of Nicorette.

I am veryyyy nervous. I have anxiety and depression and I haven’t been feeling at my best lately so i don’t know if I’m making the right decision to quit NOW. I’m also trying not to use my mental illness as an excuse to not quit. I have to work today and I’m hoping I can get through it without caving and begging for a cigarette. Does the gum really work for cravings? I got 4mg since I was a heavy smoker.

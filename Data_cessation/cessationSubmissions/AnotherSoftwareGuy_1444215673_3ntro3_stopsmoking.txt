It's time. 24 hours down.

So I made the decision yesterday to quit. I was stood outside the office puffing away when half way through I had a "What the f*#k am I doing" moment - so I stumped it out, threw away my pack and haven't touched one since.

Every time I've tried to quit before now I've always had it planned in my head, but this time it feels more like a spur of the moment thing, and that's making me feel great.

Of course now I'm craving really badly. Anybody have any advice on how to make them less intense?

Thanks in advance guys!

34 days without a cigarette, down to a minuscule amount of nicotine on the vape.

Wife and I switched to vaping, and we're now using 0mg juice, and adding like 2-3 drips of 30mg VG per 2g of juice.  (If anyone can figure out the math on that, I'd appreciate it.  Don't know how much is in a "drop" of VG.) 

The John Oliver "Tobacco" episode was what gave us the ability to finally quit.  I'll be damned if another penny of my money goes towards suing small countries that try to pass laws to keep them from selling directly to children...

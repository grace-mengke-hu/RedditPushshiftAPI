The struggle is real

I'm 42 yrs old and I'm 1 week into the "quit". 
After 26 years of more or less a pack a day, the environmental concerns (cold, wet etc) don't matter.  The cost is equivalent to the meds I will have to take for the rest of my life to counter the damage.  As the breadwinner, I can't ethically or morally allow my stubbornness or "addict thinking" to harm my family. So I quit.  I find myself asking when will I start to feel better, and debating whether a smoke will help me feel better, and will I have to start again from day 0 if I smoke just one, and is it worth it. I almost bent my steering wheel on the way home yesterday. My doctor says "Strength to Strength". I don't know about that, but I will continue to struggle. And the struggle is real.

potential unsupportive partner

I'm making a plan and due to past experiences I suspect my partner may end up being a sabotager. Don't mistake me, I KNOW I am at fault for being a smoker. I know it is up to me to make a change. 

But how do you stay strong when someone knows you're quitting but they offer you a cigarette? Or they chain smoke in front of you?

We both smoke because we're weak. But he will not deal well with being weaker than me. As in, if I give up he will not be pleased I'm stronger than him and rather than beat me at my own game he will sabotage me. He knew I had no desire to smoke after a 14 hour smoke free flight and kept offering me cigarettes until I had one.

I don't expect him to quit. His addiction is at an all time high, including waking every hour during the night to get up to smoke. He chain smokes in social situations because he is self concious. He will see my quitting as his failure.

I have a strange question, tried google but it confused google IG

So basically, I stopped smoking cigarettes around 8 months ago with the help of chantix. But recently I bought a vape and I stupidly got one with 3mg of nicotine which is the lowest amount. I only smoked it for 2 days so far but its giving me constant headaches and I already want to switch to zero nicotine.

My question is this, will it be hard for me to quit even though it has only been 2 days? Which btw, I am disabled and dont work so basically I have been sitting around and going HAM on it for 2 days, so its basically 2 days of extremely excessive use. I also have an EXTREMELY EXTREMELY addictive personality and probably the weakest will to quit addiction without the help of medications that force me to do it. 

So, am I just freaking out here? Will it be hard for me to quit already? While I wait for my 0mg nicotine juice to come in the mail, with nothing to do and access to the current 3mg juice I have, will I have a hard time? I really dont know what I was thinking and dont want to get sucked back into nicotine. Please help, and thank you for sticking with and reading this and Im sorry to bother you guys and take up your time.

TLDR: I started smoking 3mg nicotine juice 2 days ago with EXCESSIVE use, will it be hard for me to quit so soon?

I need help.

I have bronchitis, and I know it's because I smoke. I just came home after a night of drinking and smoking and my heart was pounding so hard, I felt I was going to drop dead and die. I am 32, have a hacking cough that sounds disgusting and I look significantly older than I should look. And yet I know despite all this I'm going to reach for my pack in the morning. Hell, when I was in the hospital two years ago, I had no shame wheeling my self and my IV stand out of the hospital to have a fucking drag. I feel pathetic, weak and stupid. I know I need to quit, I just needed to write it down and face the fact that ive been in denial about how truly horrible the state of my health is.

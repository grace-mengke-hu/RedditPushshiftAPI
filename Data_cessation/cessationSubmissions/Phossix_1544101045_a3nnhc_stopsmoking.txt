Thank you

To all the people of this subreddit, thank you for being so supportive. Last time I was here, I mentioned I had lapsed in trying to quit smoking after 17 days.

It has now been 166 days, according to my smoking app. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I hope I never touch one of those damn things again.

I wish I could have good news about quitting but I really don't. The reason why I ultimately quit was my Gran was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. It's been pretty difficult watching her deteriorate.  She's now been admitted to the hospice. We don't think she'll make it to Christmas. She knows she's going to die, and we all do too. That's what makes it so painful to go see her - I couldn't go for a while because of how hard it was, but I've decided I want to spend what little time I have left with her. But seeing her so frail breaks me. 

 But what makes it so much harder is she raves about how she wants "another ciggy". I hate cigarettes for this. At this point, there's conflict in my family about letting her just smoke, but I don't think my grandfather will let her. I only ever see her with a vape, but I think my aunt sneaks in some for her.

Smoking really isn't worth this.

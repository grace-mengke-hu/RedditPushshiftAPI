Just Over Two Months and Goin Strong! :D

I had had it with smoking long before I actully was able to quit. It's such a daunting task to quit. You know you'll go through withdraw. You know you'll get stressed (even easier than usual) and want to smoke to "releive" the stress. I wanted to quit for so long that my last week I did smoke, I felt only shame when I lit up. Not only did cigarettes do there part in making me feel like shit, so did the fact that I couldn't quit. How could I be that person?? The person with absolutely no will power? Just to sit idly by and let my addiction that I hated so much kill me slowly. Finally, enough was enough. I started easing off them. I went from smoking a pack a day to smoking a single cigarette after work. I did this for three days. But one cigarette a day is no better than a pack. I knew that. On the fourth day I went to reach for one and my bf gave me a look. A look that said "Come on! You're either quitting or your not". That's all it took. I wasn't going to continue to be something I hated. I was going to be proud of myself! And, here I am. Over two months later and more proud of myself than I've ever been! I feel better, I look better and I smell better. I'm a healthier, happier person! It wasn't easy. We all know it's not going to be and that's why we keep smoking. It's easier to feed the addiction than to beat it. But beating it is soooo worth it. You feel it every day! I still have the occasional craving but when I do, I just remind myself of all I've gained to lose nothing! If you want to quit, do it! You'll never regret it :)

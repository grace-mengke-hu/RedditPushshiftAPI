Quitting with an active smoker

Hey quitters, 

I've been an intermittent smoker for almost ten years, trying to quit for various and ultimately ineffective reasons (SOs encouraging me, NY resolutions, the usual). I've always been able to justify the smoking by telling myself that I'm rather young (mid 20s) and can still function pretty well physically. 

However, in the past few months, I've started to wheeze, and it horrifies me. For the first time I can feel what smoking is doing to me. I'm positing here to keep myself honest, and really try to join a community of quitters. I want to run and rock climb again, like I used to as a kid. I want to live without having my time eaten away not only by smoking itself, but by the countless minutes spent walking out to buy cigarettes, and hell, gaining the hours of work back that ultimately went directly towards earning money for more cigarettes. That hour of work that netted me my cigarette money for the day, I'm taking it back for something else. I don't know what, but it's gotta be better than cigarettes. 

I'm pretty much going to sit on here for the next few days- I'm visiting my family, many of whom smoke. Gotta replace the temptation with active encouragement and stories of success.

Hooray for one month!!!

I quit a month ago, and I only had to read half of Alan Carr. My body was going through some nasty stuff before I quit (chest pains, panic attacks, etc.), but I just realized the other day that I haven't felt bad in a while. My body and mind are healing and it feels awesome. My mood is improving, and so is my outlook on life. It's just like Alan said: It's easy, and I haven't once wanted to smoke. It's the weirdest thing, but I'll accept it no questions asked because being a non-smoker is just about the best feeling in the world. Cheers to all of you who have made the choice to quit!

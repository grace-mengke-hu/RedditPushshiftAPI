Convince Me To Not Smoke Right Now

It should be noted that I am predominately a cigar/pipe smoker, not a cigarette smoker. Even when I do smoke a cigarette, I don't inhale.

I've been smoking cigars and occasionally a pipe after my friend gave me one for Christmas last year. No more than one cigar a day at worst. Despite all of this, it only takes one to ruin the smell of my hands and the feeling in my mouth. I'm extremely sensitive to the "feel" of my mouth, as well as my breath. It goes without saying these reasons alone are enough to not smoke.

I woke up the other day after a long night of drinking and smoking an entire pack of cigarettes (note what I said before, this doesn't happen) because I broke up with my ex. My throat was soar, to a point I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore because of the feelings and sensations it left afterwards. I love my cigars, they are so relaxing and the culture behind them is immense. However I can't stand the fuzzy feeling they leave in my teeth no amount of brushing or tongue scraping seems to rectify. 

So I'm sitting here right now with a cup of tea trying to resist the urge to light my pipe up, because it is a perfect sunny day on my porch and normally these conditions are when I'd indulge. So to help me further resist that urge, give me a lot of reasons why even the occasional cigar or pipe is not ok.

So I came here looking for auxiliary support to back up my own efforts to quit. Apparently I need to "man up". This isn't the only thing keeping me from smoking, but thank you for proving Reddit is full of self-righteous fuktards and I shouldn't come here. Fuck you.

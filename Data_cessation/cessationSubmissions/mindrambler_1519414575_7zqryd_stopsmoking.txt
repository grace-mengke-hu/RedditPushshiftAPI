A new app to help you quit smoking - what do you think?

I'm currently making an app in the UK to help people quit smoking. The idea being that you save the money you'd spend on cigarettes - an amount that is invested for your future (which grows in a fund and can be withdrawn at any time).

Turn those bad habits into good, and watch that money pot grow!
What do you think of the idea?  

If you're interested in hearing more about the concept, check out our video on https://www.habitapp.co.uk/. 

If you would be interested in being one of the first people to try out our app, fill out the following contact form, and we'll let you know when it's ready!

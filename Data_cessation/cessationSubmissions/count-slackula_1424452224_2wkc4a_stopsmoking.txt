I think I'm going to have to quit drinking, too.

Desperately trying to quit, but I always smoke when I'm drinking.  I don't smoke all day but as soon as I have a beer in my hand, it's excusable.  I am a college student in a country with cheap beer, so quitting is not going to be easy, but I need to do it.  A smoke-free, cancer-free life is more important than partying.  This is it.  I start tonight.  Wish me luck.

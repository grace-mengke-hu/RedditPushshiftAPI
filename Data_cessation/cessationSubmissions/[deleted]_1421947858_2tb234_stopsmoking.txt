One week tobacco free! E-ciggarettes count as quitting right?

Started smoking way too young at around 14. I'm 24 and have been smoking 20-30 a day. 

Here's the thing, everytime I've tried to give up but without nicotine I turn into a complete asshole. Like, I have to cut social ties for fear of losing friendships when not on tobacco. Last time I quit cold-tukey for 2 weeks,  my housemate nearly moved out, not even kidding.

I got an ecigarette for christmas and left it sitting for a few weeks and then decided to give it a go this day last week with little to no expectations. 

Usually when I quit I'm ok for a few hours but then between 24-72 hours I'm literally sweating and from nictine withdrawel. 

Since I've used my ecig, I've had none of these problems. Sure it's not quite the same as waking up to a coffee and cigarette in the morning but it's 90% as close IMO and is enough to seriously make me think i'll quit for good this time.

Basically, all I want to say is that if quitting cold turkey doesn't work for you then at least try ecigarettes. They've been a revelation to me.

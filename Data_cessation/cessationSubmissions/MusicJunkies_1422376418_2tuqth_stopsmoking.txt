So it's been a little over 3 months...

I'm 22 and was a smoker for 5 years. Since I've quit, I wake up congested every morning. It gets better throughout the day, but It gets annoying having to expel mucous every morning. Anyways, just needed to vent. If anyone has any tips on how to deal with congestion it would be much appreciated.

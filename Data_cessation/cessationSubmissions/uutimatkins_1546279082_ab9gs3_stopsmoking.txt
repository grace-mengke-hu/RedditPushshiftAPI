Quit at 10pm in 12/30

I quit once before and had successfully switched over to using a vape. Then a very stressful time saw me go back. It’s now a couple years later and going again. Got the smoke free app. Got vape ready. Etc. 

One thing that’s different is my reason for quitting. Last time it was just money (and when I got a big raise, that motivation went away.). Now it’s part money but also more good reasons. 

I’ve got the next week off - I remember being miserable for a week last time then I was fine. 

Anywho I’ll be here lurking. Got a friend I can message whenever to chat and distract me through cravings. 

One day at a time. One hour at a time.

Welp. Reset the badge.

I've been smoking. I've cheated myself out of the hard work it took to get to over 200 days. Now, I've reset my badge.

I stopped visiting you guys after about 100 days because I felt that I had a good handle on my cravings.

But no. I've cracked in the last month, and frankly, I can't think now even why or what was the first one I had when I started again.

Let this be a lesson to everyone who thinks they've got it licked.

I hope you all welcome me back; I know you will.

Dental work 2 weeks after quitting smoking

I decided to finally get the cleaning my dentists said I needed! It feels so so good to see all the streaks on my teeth from smoking disappear in only 30 minutes. It really helps with recovery (: I recommend others to try it too!! Itâ€™s good for your overall health ðŸ¥° itâ€™s like a weight being lifted

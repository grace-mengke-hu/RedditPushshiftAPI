This has to be my 20th quit attempt

I am sure you have all by now heard the quote, "quitting smoking is easy, I've done it 1000 times." That's how I feel right now. This morning I had my last piece of nicotine gum, and after holding out all day I just now cleared the last bit of juice out of my vape. I have no more nicotine in my possession. I am mentally prepared for the irritability and discomfort that is to come. I already know what it is going to be like because I have done it so many times before.

I feel like smoking and vaping aren't conducive to the lifestyle I live but I find myself around smoking, vaping, chewing, you name it, almost every day, and that causes me to pick it back up again. 

Perhaps that's a good excuse.

There really is no way I can avoid going to meetings where a large group of people go out to smoke regularly. Let's just say if I were to stop going to those meetings, I might pick up a much stronger poison than a cigarette. Anybody have any experience with being around smoking and vaping a lot or getting offered/invited to participate a lot? I mean, a lot of people I hang out with smoke and vape in their cars, and it's just everywhere in^A^A

Any other general advice or anything is appreciated as well!

Going to try and stay on this sub for a while to help stay in the right mindset.

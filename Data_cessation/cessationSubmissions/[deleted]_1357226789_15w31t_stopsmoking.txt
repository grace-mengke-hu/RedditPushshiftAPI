75 days, you can too.

I smoked for 8 years. It sounds weird to say that, but it's true. I tried to quit multiple times, but it never stuck. One thing was different this time: I had /r/stopsmoking. I never would have thought that a subreddit I joined on a whim have such an impact on my life. Special shout-out to Allen Carr's *Easy Way to Quit Smoking*. There's a reason it is linked so often here. That book is very odd, in that it is a poorly written book that repeats itself constantly and never seems to give you a **true** "easy way to quit", but goddamned if I wasn't quoting that book to myself constantly for the first month. I know I'm rambling here, but I really wanted to say THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU /r/stopsmoking. I couldn't have done it without you. All you New Year's resolutioners - keep it up, check in here daily, stay strong. I have made it 75 days, and you can too.

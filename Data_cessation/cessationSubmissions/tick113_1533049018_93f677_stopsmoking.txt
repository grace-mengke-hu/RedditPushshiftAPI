5 years free, and it started here

I haven't come here for a long time, but I had to for my 5th anniversary of being free. r/stopsmoking is what kept me afloat those first hours, days, weeks, and even months. The support here was amazing.

Do I still think about smoking? Yup, every time I see someone, or smell it, and sometimes even dream it. Every time, though, it's a wonderful feeling of freedom. I don't miss it at all.

Heck, maybe someone reading this is on day 1. That was rough for me. I was 1.5-2 packs a day to nothing. I was has hooked as anyone, and if I can break free anyone can. Keep it up, y'all are awesome!

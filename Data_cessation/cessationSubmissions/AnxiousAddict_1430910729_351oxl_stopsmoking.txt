damn them cravings

In the begining i had a very strong resolve and could handle myself very well around my smoker friends. but now it's weakening and I again am at a stage where i can't trust myself anymore. strong cravings, lack of self confidence, igniting self hatred. this sucks balls. cant give in yet. FML
EDIT: You guys are awesome.. thanks :)

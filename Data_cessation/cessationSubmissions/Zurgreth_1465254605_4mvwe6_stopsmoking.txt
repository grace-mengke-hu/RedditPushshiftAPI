Start my first day tomorrow, just had my last cig. Any tips? [17M]

I'm so fed up with smoking and how it affects my healthy, mentally and physically. I want to live life to it's fullest and not be drawn back on activities to do with my girlfriend because I'm not fit enough. She hates seeing me smoking, she says she's basically watching me die. Been smoking for a year now, rolling tobacco about 15 a day. Tips guys?

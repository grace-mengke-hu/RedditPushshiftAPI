Day 3 (motivation)

Feeling really irritated been taking naps all day . Well i have been doing the nofap too . I think smoking was really a trigger to my PMO well its a doubt . but since i have stopped smoking i havent had an urge to fap yet . but my urge to smoke is not going down at all anyways i am in a situation i wont be able to get my hands on one any ideas how to keep your mind distracted ? anyways today morning for the first time my breath didnt smell like ash . it was a surprise but feels good .

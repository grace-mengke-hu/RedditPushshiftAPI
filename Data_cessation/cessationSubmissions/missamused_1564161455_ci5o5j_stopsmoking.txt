Feeling in control again

I quit on January 1st 2019. I relapsed on April 26th. Ever since then, I would quit for 2 days then go right back to a pack a day. It became mentally exhausting and set my depression into overdrive. Finally, I said enough is enough and here I am on day 7! I know itâ€™s not long. But i made it past 2 days at least.

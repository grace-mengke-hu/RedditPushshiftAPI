Plan to Hit Bottom. Wish me luck.

I have this week off.  So, I'm quitting.  This post is a public reminder to myself.

Day One - Tonight -- I'm going to drink as much alcohol as I can manage.  I want to feel miserable tomorrow.

Day Two - Monday -- I'm going to associate every hangover symptom to cigarettes.  From dehydration to post-binge depression, from grimey teeth to dry and dirty feeling skin and hair.  Everything's the cigarette's fault.  And it'll be true, because I will avoid my normal hangover cures until I destroy my cigarettes.  I will not eat, I will not drink, I will not shower, I will not brush my teeth.  I will be miserable and disgusting until I quit.  I want to feel like I've hit bottom.  At the end of the day, whether I've cured my hangover or not, I will destroy my remaining cigarettes.

The rest of the week I will spend showering twice a day, working out, occupying myself with activities I enjoy but don't associate with smoking, and drinking water whenever I get a craving.  I will sleep well, and do everything I can to enjoy my vacation.  And the icing on the cake will be calling myself a non-smoker at the end of the holiday.

Here's saying good-riddance to more than half my lifetime spent smoking: Cheers~!

Hey guys! Thanks for the support, it's been 22 days. I want to have your opinions, about this topic.

Hello!

I was smoking only 3-4 cigarettes a day, for only 1 year, but it was enough, to make me feel bad, so i quit. I always loved to use my hookah, because it just made me so many good nights, where people just sit around, and talk to each other, while the hookah goes around.

I'm going to go to college, and 10 days from now on will happen a freshmen camp. It's made to make contacts, and to get to know each other better, and i'm thinking about taking my hookah with me, to make it "easier", and more intimate.

I didn't use my hookah since i quit, so I want to know your opinions, is it a stupid idea to bring it, and how much will it make me feel bad, if i do bring it.

Thanks a lot!

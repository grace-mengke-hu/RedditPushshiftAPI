Pregnant and quitting. When does it get better?

I think most of quitters set a quit date and prepare themselves for that. However I didn't get the chance as it was the pregnancy test who decided that I must quit. NOW.

12 hours into no smoking I chewed a first gum, because it's living hell. I smoked for 10 years and wasn't expecting to do this. Or at least I was expecting that like most of pregnant ladies I'll feel nauseous from the smell, quite the opposite - suddenly the smell and taste of the smoke became the best thing in the world. This baby is craving for cigarettes!

I just want to forget that I want to smoke. When does it get easier? A day into this? Two days, three, a week? It seems like the past 3 hours was one big non stop craving :(

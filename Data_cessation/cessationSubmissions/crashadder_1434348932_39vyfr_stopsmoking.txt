shiny new star on my badge

Hi there guys,
today marks the 7th month since i am free of nicotine in any form. It feels great. I must admit i get cue conditioned urges every now and then but they dont posses real threat. What made things harder for me is the weight gain. regained all the weight i've lost during the 6th months before i quit. So i am sometimes tempted to go back to smoking thinking that i'd become slim fit again. I know it sounds silly. but thats what addiction sorta makes you right ? one funny thing about today . something that caused an urge. my bade has "seven stars" on it. which also is the name of my favorite brand of smokes all time.  :-) thats the brand i had smoked during my stay in Japan back in 1999. But being free from nicotine i realized that they are all the same. and i support the plain packaging law.
thank you all for the support

Insomnia

I just quit a couple days ago after a pretty long habit of about 12 a day.

The nicotine cravings are manageable but the insomnia is awful - mostly caused by the lung & throat pain and itching of everything healing. Is there any good remedy for this, or is it just something I have to deal with for a few weeks?

Why I finally quit for good this time.

My parents were smokers.  I guess that's where I picked up the habit.  They quit in 1991.

Fast forward to December of 2011.  My mom is having surgery to get the left middle lobe of her lung removed.  It's cancer.

I started taking chantix the week before her surgery.  The night of her surgery, I smoked my last cigarette.  I took chantix for a month and a half.  Lucky for me I didn't have bad side effects.  I took it right before I went to bed and didn't get the weird dreams.

My mom's checkups always come back clear.  But it scared me straight, once and for all.  I think of my kids and how I want to be around them as they grow up.

Do it for yourself, do it for you SO, do it for your kids, hell do it for your pets.  You can do it.  I smoked over a pack a day for 30 years.  I know if I can quit, then you can too.  

I just know I got tired of this ruling my life.  I took control of my life again.

Worried and hoping for some help.

Figure I'd best give some info first. I don't smoke and never have. However, my mom does. She hasn't smoked around me in 5+ years though.

I went to the doctor about half an hour ago and she was checking my ears and stuff. When she got to my lungs she asked if I smoke and I told her I never had but my mother does. She said she noticed a difference in my lungs like I had been around smoke. It kind of freaked me out but I was too busy processing that at the moment to think to ask her any questions about it. 

Can anybody tell me if this is something I should be worried about? Also, is this something I should tell my mom about? It's a touchy subject in my family because my sister is very blunt about it so I'm not sure how to approach it if so. Also, should I go back and ask to talk to the doctor I saw?

Studying! Seeing people smoke. Don't want to and won't do it. However, the cravings can still get intense

Triggers. Seeing somebody on a walk tonight with his cigarette, a dreamy look on his face. Completing study and homework for a deadline tomorrow. And a bunch of other triggers. I don't feel stressed and I actually like these tasks, but I feel like I want a cigarette. It's coming and going all evening. I never had such an intense quit as this one. Not quite a month in and I still want one. I don't actually want one when I think about it but that craving feeling is crazy strong sometimes. It is much better than the beginning, just frustrated this still happens and makes it hard to concentrate on tasks at hand. It'll get better. My brain is healing itself with each trigger overcome. Breathe. Water. Snack. Whew. Thanks for listening to my sharing and the support.

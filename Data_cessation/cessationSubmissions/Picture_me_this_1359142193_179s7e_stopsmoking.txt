Made an attempt this morning and didn't succeed in quitting, yet!

So I made sort of an impromptu attempt last night, without really psyching myself up. Lasted till about 3 PM. I'm proud of my effort. This will be the third time I've "quit". Any suggestions about how to psych myself up for the next attempt?

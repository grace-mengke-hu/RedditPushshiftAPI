Kind of freaking out. What are my odds of having lung cancer at 26?

Good afternoon.


Essentially the title. I'm way too much in my head for my own good and I'm not sure how to stop it. 


I've been smoking maybe 5-10 cigarettes from 19-23. 23-25 I've smoked about a pack a day.


Doctor heard wheezing in my chest at the physical. Said hes never heard it in someone my age and said it's a sign of advanced smoking damage. Wants me to get an XRay immediately. 


So I have to wait until Monday to get it done. In the meantime, how fucked am I? I've quit for a bit now. Just when i wanted to make a good change, I get slapped in the face with concerning information from the doctor.


Any advice I'd be so grateful for.

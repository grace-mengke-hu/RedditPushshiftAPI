Ok im ready to quit

So my wife has been trying to get me to quit for years and I have tried about 12 times. Longest I lasted was 8 months. I tried vaping, I tried gum patches you name it. No pills though because I heard nightmares can happen and not about that.

Anyway fast forward to yesterday afternoon. I was walking with my daughter to the store and a stranger told me she is adorable. I thanked him and kept walking. She was in the stroller falling asleep and I was sneaking a cigarette. He told me I'm selfish and need to quit so I can be around for her when she's older. I told him I will try and I know I need to quit. I don't know of all the people that told me to quit including myself, this is the person that made something go off in my mind. As I walked back from the store I kept thinking about the words I had heard earlier. I stopped in the middle of the road. Threw out my smokes and lighter. And decided this was it. Today was day 1 of no cigarettes. I am determined to make it work this time. It's hard I'm angry but every time I think of smoking. I think of being there for my daughter.

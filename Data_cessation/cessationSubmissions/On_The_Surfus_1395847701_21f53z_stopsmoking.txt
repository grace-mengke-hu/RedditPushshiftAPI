Replacing smoking with objects/behaviors

A friend of mine told me once that his father quit smoking by chewing on toothpicks whenever he got the urge to smoke a cigarette. I also read someone on Reddit advise a person to go wash his hands every time he got a craving. Has anything like that worked for any of you guys?

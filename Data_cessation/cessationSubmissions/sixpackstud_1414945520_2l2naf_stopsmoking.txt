Giving up weed and tobbaco

So today is the first proper attempt on giving up weed and tobbaco! 
A little back story: been sober frm alcohol for over two years but i continued to smoke weed and go to meetings. But ive decided to step up my recovery and give up weed cause i feel its about time. I guess im on here because today is tougher than i thought. My friends were hanging with an old drinking ex-buddy last night which really got my blood boilimg cause they kmow what a dickhead hes been. Guess im just looking for support cause i feel kinda alone at the moment. Dispite this - almost five oclock and still havent smoked :)


Edit:i wanna thank everyone for their input. Im truely touched by the support people show here. Its reallly helping. Thank you all you awesome people

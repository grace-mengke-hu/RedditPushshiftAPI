Anyone else crying for no reason?

Pack a day for 15 years, finished Allan Carr's book 5 days ago and haven't smoked in two and a half days. I'm crying uncontrollably for the second time today, and for no reason that I can identify. I feel happy that I'm quitting, it's well worth the discomfort I'm feeling, and I'm very much looking forward to healing my body from the abuse. Also, I'm just not a person who cries a lot in general. Why the fuck am I crying? 

I've been cold turkey so far, but if I can't keep it together emotionally, I might consider nicotine patches for a few weeks. Anyone have any advice?

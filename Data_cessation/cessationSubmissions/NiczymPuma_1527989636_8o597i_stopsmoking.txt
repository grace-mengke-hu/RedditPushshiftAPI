Non-smoker in job. Smoker when there's a provider and Im not working.

TLDR: I work for 12 hours and I only smoke before and after job. 

Usually I would smack a pack during this time, but after 2 years of trying to quit (one 8 month break, and many day-week)


Is it because i somehow tricked my mind into not smoking in job like it is not okay to smoke, is it because I dont have anyone who would give me cigs as I dont have any in job (even though there are people that could provide one or two), or what's the reason? I want to not smoke before and after job too :/

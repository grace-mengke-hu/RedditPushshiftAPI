1 Year Nicotine-Free !

I did it !      
There is exactly one year and three days, I did not buy a new pack of tobacco, I did not roll any cigarette. I bought a weed vaporizer that day and a pipe to make sure i'll never use cannabis mixed with tobacco again.  (I don't use the pipe much. When there is technical problems with the vapo, it can be useful, but it is at least as harmful as smoking joints with tobacco so I prefer to avoid using it.). 

I did not use any external things to quit (no nicotine patche, no nicotine gum, no nicotine sweets, no E-cigarette, even without nicotine) because I almost tried it all during my 10-years life of smoker, and none had good effects on me, appart from making me craving Nicotine again. I just *wanted* to quit really much.      
I took the weed vaporizer decision because another thing that made me smoke tobacco again in the past was mixing tobacco in joints. And I did not wanted to quit using cannabis, or at least at the same time as tobacco.   

If I knew one year back that I would make it ! I'm impressed to have reach that point. Now I really feel being a non-smoker.     
I did have some weird cigarette desires, but it is really not frequent.  Last time I had a dream where I smoked was two or three weeks ago.      

Sometimes I only compare it with food : I don't have cravings like I need to eat and i'm hungry / starving. It's more like a really good meal you did not have for a long time, you are curious about it. But those feelings are easy to cope with, and not really strongs. And I really know taking just **one** cigarette would be really bad idea. 

I feel like I will *never* smoke tobacco again. Do you guy have someting to warn me about after reaching this point ?    
Did some of you had hard times after 1 year ?    
Some of you did smoke back ?     

Have a good week end everyone, we can all make it :-)

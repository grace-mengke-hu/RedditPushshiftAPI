Chest Pains

Today I have chest pains. I've been smoking loads and just can't seem to stop myself! Had some gum last night but folded and ended up going to the shop. 

I've tried so hard to quit in the past or just cut down but I can't! I managed two days in march but folded.

Going on a date tonight and I'm going to take my gum and blow the dust off my electric cigarette.

Does anyone have any advice or tips that helped them but down/quit? 

Thanks!

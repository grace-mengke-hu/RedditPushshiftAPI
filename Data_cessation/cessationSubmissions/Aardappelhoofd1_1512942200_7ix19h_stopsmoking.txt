Silly question about coughing after kissing a smoker &gt;one month of quitting

I smoked for about ten years, last five years about a pack a day and quit a little over a month ago, cold turkey and doing quite okay. I have some difficult moments, but not once I almost caved in. 

So I met a new guy, ridiculously cute bla bla bla, and he’s a smoker (oops!). Now we kissed for the first time yesterday, and even though I haven’t coughed at all since I quit smoking, I have been having this really bad smokers cough today for the first time.

I feel a little silly for even asking this question, but can kissing a smoker give you that nasty smoker cough, or is it just a coincidence I start coughing now out of nowhere? Just wondering if it could even be related at all.

Edit

Typo in title, of course. &gt;one month after(!) quitting

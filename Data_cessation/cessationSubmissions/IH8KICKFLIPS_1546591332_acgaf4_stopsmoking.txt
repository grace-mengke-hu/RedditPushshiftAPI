It’s been 3 full days...

Tonight I decided to have a few drinks. I’ve realized something. I’ve never enjoyed a good beer in such a long time until tonight. Why?

Nicotine has demanded all my praise, my attention, affection, my joy. I never took the time to enjoy the meal I had, the lovely scenic drive, the delicious dark logger beer. No. Nicotine demanded that I enjoy these things and then give it the respect it didn’t deserve.
 
It’s almost like nicotine demanded I enjoy all the good in life and then admit that it was king. It desired to suck out any joy I could possibly find and anything without it. ANYTHING. It is a relentless master. 

I’ve only quit once before for 6 months. Even though I’m only 3 days in I’ve realized something. EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITHOUT NICOTINE. 

Never ever ever let it fool you again into thinking that you can’t enjoy things without it. Good luck everyone.

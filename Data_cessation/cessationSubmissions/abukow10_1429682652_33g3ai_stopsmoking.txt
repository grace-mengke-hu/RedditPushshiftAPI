Here goes!

Hi I'm Adam :) 24 been smokin about 8 years tried more than a couple times to stop smoking cigs... I have 3 left in my pack and I'm standing in the garage burning 1 as I type... I keep telling myself the time seriously has come.. There is zero upside to smoking, and I don't know if it's more habit than addiction. Regardless, after these last 3 in the pack I'm gonna try again. Also the hole in the neck commercial really got to me. Ew! Anyways wish me luck I'll be updating... I can fucking do this!!!!!

I'm terrified about my health

Smoked 20 a day for 11 years and recently 23 since B&H upped their box size.

Reasons I'm giving up:

My son is now 1

My wife hates it

New office job, don't want to be *that* guy

Taking my inhaler 5+ times per day

Basically my health is fucked, time to fight back! Wish me luck.

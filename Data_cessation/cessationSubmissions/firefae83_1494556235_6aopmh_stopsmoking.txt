Day 4, When does it get easier?

I needed to quit because I have a surgery at the end of the month. I don't know if I'm going to start back up or not after surgery. Part of me thinks, "Yes! Quitting is GOOD! You should have done it a long time ago! Keep going! You can do it!" But the other side is thinking, "OMFG I WANT A SMOKE SOOOOO BAD!! I can just have one, or just smoke for a week, and quit 3 days before surgery, then go back to smoking after I come home."

I'm so torn! And the hardest part is being bored. I smoke when I'm bored, then I'm not completely bored any more. I'm trying to keep busy with games and puzzles. I guess it's working, I haven't smoked one yet. I'm doing good, it's just really hard.

Also, I live with my mom and her boyfriend, and they are both smokers. So I'm around it all. the. time. Ugh.

I really think it's a good idea to keep the quit permanent, but... when does it get easier?

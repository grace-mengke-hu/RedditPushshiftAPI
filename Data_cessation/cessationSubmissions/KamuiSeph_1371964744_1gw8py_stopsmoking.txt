6 Months Reflection

Hello guys, It has been six months now since I quit on December 23rd.  
I want to share what I've dealt with and how I dealt with it.  
Early on in the first few months, not smoking was easy. I had temptations, but I never seriously thought "hey, I should smoke again". I quit for a goal - to spend more time with the love of my life. That is, I want to be as healthy as possible so that I (hopefully) die as late as possible.  
So the first few months were easy. Then it got a bit rougher; I started thinking that maybe, just maybe, I could start again. At some point. Maybe not even now, but when I'm old and it wont matter.  
Then I started thinking, maybe I can start again after we have kids and they go off to college; maybe I'll get a good pipe.  
Then I started thinking, maybe I can start again after we graduate and get stable jobs.  
Maybe I can start again before we get married, and quit afterwards.  
Maybe I can start again now and quit after we have kids.  
Maybe I can start again now...  
**It's a horrible chain. Never start thinking that way.**  
Because as soon as you do, you are telling yourself that it is okay to smoke. When? Doesn't matter. As soon as you acknowledge that it is okay to smoke, you will (in time) come to think that it's okay to smoke now.  
Thankfully, over these six months I've had my girlfriend supporting me and I've rationalized some things on my own as well.  
It was a tough ride, but so far, I don't feel like giving up. I can breathe easier, I don't smell like ass and I've saved 965,1 USD.  
**Don't give up guys, and never let yourself think that somewhere down the line, you can start smoking again. Because as soon as you draw the line, it will keep creeping closer towards now.**  

Stay strong!

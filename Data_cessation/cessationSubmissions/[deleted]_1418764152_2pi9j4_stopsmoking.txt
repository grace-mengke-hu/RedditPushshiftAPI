Quit smoking for 166 days and fell back into it hard

I was a smoker for 2 years and eventually just quit by accident. All my friends moved away so I didn't feel like busing over to Quebec to buy cigarettes (I live right on the border of it and my province). I thought about it but just didn't bother. Well, I just turned 19 and immediately bought a pack and smoked half of it. I threw up and nearly passed out but all the rush of it just came crashing back. I feel guilty I smell awful my throat is sore but I enjoyed it so much and now that I'm old enough to buy cigarettes in my province I feel like I'll never be able to quit. I just love everything about smoking and it feels like well I'll never get sick from it im not really addicted I don't NEED to but...I don't know it's just, I really did think I was fine without it but after one day I'm back to shitty old habits

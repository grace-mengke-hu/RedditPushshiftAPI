1 month, 15 days.

Just wanted to give a check in since I haven't done it in a few weeks. I honestly forget that I was once a smoker and that I have an app keeping track of how long this has been the case. 

So here I am, at a month and a half! I remember my first post on this subreddit, and Reddit in general, declaring that I wouldn't smoke another cigarette again. 

For those of you just starting out, it is possible to do, and you'll be feeling fantastic in no time!

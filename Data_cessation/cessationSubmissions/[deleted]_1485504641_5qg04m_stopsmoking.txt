Taking my first step

I am 4 hours smoke free. Such bad cravings. Feels bad. My whole being is calling out for a cigarette. Would feel so good. But I can't. I have a mission to complete. I must become one of those people. Nicotine patches help. I don't feel the cravings as bad. Are those bad or do they help? Won't I still be addicted to nicotine?

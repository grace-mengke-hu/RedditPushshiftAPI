Day 12

Wow. I never thought I could be on day 12 of not smoking. I'm ashamed to say that I've been smoking for 38 years. It has been a perceived coping mechanism.  I've know for a long time that I need to quit but I haven't wanted to quit.
I now have outspoken teenage boys who have been begging me to quit. So.......here I am. I no longer want to be a bad example for them not do I want to continue to be a hypocrite.  
BUT, THIS IS SO HARD!!!!!!!  
I have such cravings.  A very low-nicotine vape is helping. I have not smoked but I sure do miss it so much. Does it ever get better?  Will I get to the point of feeling proud of not smoking. When will I be able to consider myself a non-smoker?

Question about lungs after quitting.

So I am going on 20 days without a cig. I developed a nasty respiratory infection about two weeks ago that hasn't really gotten better. I have seen the doctors twice, started with a Z pack and all that jazz, yesterday went for an x-ray to see if its a pneumonia. I am still wheezing, and having trouble getting stuff up. The stuff that does come up looks just like the crap I used to cough up when I was a smoker. Grey blotchy mucus, sometimes some bloody mucus.

Just wondering if anyone here has experienced a terrible lung infection or something similar to this after quitting, and how to tell if I am actually sick or whether or not i'm just purging all the gunk.

I know this is gross and I apologize.

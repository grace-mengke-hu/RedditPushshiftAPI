Oh how I love spitting mucus

Not really, but I can smell normally again. I can still remember the disgusting smell of sulfur on my fingers, hair, clothes, and upper lip. Its been 1 week, but it feels much longer. 

I haven't cleaned my car of the ashes yet mainly because I'm lazy, but it also serves as a motivation because that shit staaaankkkkks.

Triple digits!

100 days today! The first month was hard but it gets easier. I don't find working outdoors with smokers to be triggering anymore. I'll get one or two cravings here and there but nothing major. I did consume a lot of sunflower seeds for the first couple months as an alternative to smoking though.

Also congratulations to all of you who are putting in the effort to stop smoking!

Thinking About Going Out for the 1st time.. (could be risky)

So before i quit i used to love going to techno club nights. The thing is they often involved many ciggs, and they seemed almost vital to the enjoyment of the night just to break up the hours of dancing while also getting a chance to cool off outside. I havent been out these past 3 weeks but I'm thinking about going to a night tomorrow/next weekend but know it would increase the risk factor.

Has anyone that used to enjoy clubbing had experience with this before, best advice? I was thinking maybe if i go out sober that would help me get used to the idea of going out without ciggs while i still have the power of rational non-pissed thought still with me. Then after a couple of nights like that maybe allow some drinking??

Thank you for reading and any replies in advance!

Much love to all the quitting community.

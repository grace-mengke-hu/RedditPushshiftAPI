I ran out of change to put in my save jar.

Fun fact: I've apparently accumulated $33.01 in change over time.
I got $10 cash back during my work break to break down and add in to it, and it dawned on me. I've been giving up basically that much every couple of days at least, but this time, it was being handed back to me. Feels good.

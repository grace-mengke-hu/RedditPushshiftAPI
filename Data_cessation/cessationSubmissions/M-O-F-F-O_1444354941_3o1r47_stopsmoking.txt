Second time round. Obligatory hype post.

So I'm back. Back here because I'm smoking again. The only reason I am smoking again is because I failed to quit. I'm going to give it another go. Hopefully this time will be the last time I have to go through this. I can't wait to feel as good as I did last time after going 90+ days without a cigarette. Wish me luck.

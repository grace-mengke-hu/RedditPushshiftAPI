Mornings and nights seem to be the worst..

Day 4 now, quit cold turkey no alternatives or supplements of any sort. Other than hard candies and regular chewing gum! Thanks to this community that gave me so many ways of coping with the cravings.

 Thank you for all the help so far, you people helped me more than you know!! Much love <3

Third time is the charm?

The title says it all. I have tried to quit smoking seriously twice earlier, but failed miserably. I am pretty determined this time. I already downloaded TWO quit smoking apps on my mobile which will keep track of my progress.

Also, I would like to post my daily progress here. Hope it's not annoying to you all :)

I woke up 2 months ago, and quit cold turkey by turning cravings into a game.

I am 29 now, and I started smoking at 18ish, so for 11 years I never missed a day of smoking, period.   I was about 1.5 pack/day smoker.  On heavy drinking or gambling nights, I would smoke 2-3 packs. 

Smoking controlled every aspect of my life and schedule.  There was always an excuse to smoke:   Fun, sad, bored, anxious, excited, nervous, full, rich, broke, driving, walking, working.   This is the biggest trick of nicotine, it makes everything and anything SEEM better.    

The day I quit, I woke up hungover.   Usually I would want to immediately smoke, but I didn't act on that feeling.   Instead, I simply decided to quit.  I can't explain why, or how.   The first few days were hard, but not impossible.

I embraced the cravings and turned them into a game.   Each time I defeated a craving and chose to stay smoke-free, that specific craving was pretty much gone forever.   Since every situation, action, and emotion was a trigger....  it was kinda fun to see how many I could defeat in one day (about 5-10 the first few days).

 After common ones were defeated, it was more fun to identify and defeat the rarities.   Like, "Oooooh, it's cloudy and it's getting brisk, and there is a NNW wind at 8 mph.  MUST SMOKE #*)$@*#$)*@#$."   

I rarely think about smoking anymore, and can't imagine going back.  The change in my health and overall well-being is amazing.  



EDIT:   I would also like to give credit to whyquit.com.   I kept their website open on my phone for the first week or two.   It was a nice distraction for times when I might have been smoking.   Instead of smoking to pass a few minutes, I could whip out my phone and read..... they have a lot of great content to browse.

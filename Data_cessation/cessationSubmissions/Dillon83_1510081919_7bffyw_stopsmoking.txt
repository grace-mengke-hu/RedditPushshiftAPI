Depression

Would love to hear from some people ahead of me. I’m approaching day 60 and while the first few weeks were challenging they did feel ok. Around day 30-40 I was hit with this depression that has come and gone but it’s pretty deep when it comes. I really do not want medication so I would appreciate any knowledge about wether this can happen at this stage. Also if anyone has had this clear up with time.

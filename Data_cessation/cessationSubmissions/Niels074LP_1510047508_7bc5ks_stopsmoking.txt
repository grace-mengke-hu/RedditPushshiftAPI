I am doing it, guys. Just a quick question.

Can you believe it? Me!
The person that has been on here twice, informing everyone I am going to do this, just to follow up by failing on day 1.
After the last time I was actually so ashamed, that I have not posted here for a while. 

I decided I would follow the one thing I kept consistently reading here, I decided to buy Allen Carr's Easyway to quit smoking and you know what, I am now on day 6. It has been really easy, I don't know how, I don't know why, but I know the Easyway has helped me become a non-smoker. 

Although I didn't experience any mental problems yet, nor have I had a hard time dealing with the physical withdrawal, since it is basicly not even there unless you think about it, just like hunger, except you don't have to satisfy this hunger. Sorry, I digress... I have been having some mild nausea the past 2 days, to the point where I constantly feel like puking, well maybe not constantly, but about 4 times an hour. How long would it take for this to go away, because at work it is not very comfortable, to say the least. 

Anyways, that is all I wanted to know right now. I hope you guys are having a blast being free on the slavery also!

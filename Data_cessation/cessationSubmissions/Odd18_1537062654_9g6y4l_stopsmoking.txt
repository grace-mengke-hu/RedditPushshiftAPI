Concentration

Anyways, I'm a dipper, but I see that r/stopdipping is not nearly as active as this sub is. I've chewed snuff for the last 7 or 8 years or so (am 23) ranging from 1/2 to two cans a day. Currently working on quitting cold turkey, and am two days in. 

**This. Fucking. Sucks.** As all of you know. Probably the worst part is my concentration, or lack thereof. I like to read a lot, and I find myself reading over the same parts as much as like ten times (sometimes even just a single sentence) before I'm able to focus on it and/or understand it. I could usually kill 150-200 pages on a day like today (stuck inside in the middle of Hurricane Florence) but instead I've killed 40 or 50 at about 30% comprehension I'd say. It's driving me absolutely mad. 

How long will having 3rd grade levels of concentration and reading comprehension last? Does anyone have any advice as to how to mitigate it so I can go back to reading like a normal person? I've been chewing gum three pieces at a time all day to no avail other than severely sore temples. 

Thanks.

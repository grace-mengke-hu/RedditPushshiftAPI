Quitting smoking

I'm 18, been smoking for 2 years now. Smoked 24 packs throughout that time and I'm quitting cause I've started smoking more since the summer has started (6 packs since June). I don't want to get attached cause I feel like my breath has gotten way shorter. I'm concerned about my health, is the damage I've done throughout the years permanent?

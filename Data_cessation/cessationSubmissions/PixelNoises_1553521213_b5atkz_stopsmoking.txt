Today I stopped smoking

So I've been smoking since I was 14 years old (23 today)
But today I decided to quit the cigarettes.

What is some good advice, that kept you away from smoking?
I haven't had a smoke for the last 5 hours now and I am actually feeling okay.. But i'm still scared that I will fall back into the pit at any moment..

Thanks guys!

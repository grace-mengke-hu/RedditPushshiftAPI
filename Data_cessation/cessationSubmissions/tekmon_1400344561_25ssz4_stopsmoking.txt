2 years without a cigarette. If I can do it...

In a few days I will be a "non-smoker"  for 2 years.  I started when I turned 18 in college... It started off with just drinking, then a few years later, before I know it, I was a pack a day smoker where I basically capped out for the last few years of my smoking career.  I smoked for a little over 10 years. 

I have no desire whatsoever to smoke any more, because I know that if I take even one puff, I'm back to being a smoker.  Screw that. 

Here's my advice for anyone that cares - 

* **Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking** - A lot of people recommend this book.  It's great, but here's my dirty little secret: I didn't read this book and instantly become a non-smoker.  I read it, decided to quit, then broke after a few days. Read it again a month later, quit, and broke.  It was finally on the third time that it stuck.  So if you read this book and it "didn't work" for you - read it again.  Keep reading it because the advice in it is as solid as it gets. 
* **Write a letter to yourself** - On the third and final time I quit, I was so fed up with being addicted that I wrote a letter to myself.  I still have it somewhere I think.  The idea is to make a promise to yourself that you really want to be a non-smoker... let it all out!  When you think you're going to break - read your letter and the reasons why you quit. 
* **You really have to hate smoking** - If you're a heavy smoker like I was, the truth is you probably enjoy it. I actually liked the act of smoking and the feels it gave me, which is why I think earlier attempts to quit didn't work.  When I got to the point that whenever I put a cigarette in my mouth and I would think I was a total piece of shit, that's when I was determined to become a non-smoker.  

It's really a mental thing.  Once you're past the physical addiction in a few days, the triggers are all mental.  The good news is that they gradually get weaker and weaker.  If you can, I recommend a 3 week detox period... don't go out drinking, don't smoke weed, don't do anything that makes you tempted to smoke.  In a few months, you don't even think about smoking anymore.

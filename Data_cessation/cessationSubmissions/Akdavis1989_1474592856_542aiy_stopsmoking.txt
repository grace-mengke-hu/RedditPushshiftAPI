Day 3. I don't want to play anymore.

My fianc√©e asked me to stop smoking. So I did, on Tuesday. 
Problem is that I really enjoy smoking. Everything about it. And I really don't enjoy the withdrawal. But she asked me to so here I am. Tormented. Driven on by sheer stupid stubbornness. 
Anyway, I hear it gets less shitty?

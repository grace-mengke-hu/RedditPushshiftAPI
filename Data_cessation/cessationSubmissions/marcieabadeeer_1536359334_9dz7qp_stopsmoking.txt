Does anyone else feel weird?

I quit back in May so I’m over 4 months smoke free after smoking 10-20 a day for about 12 years. 

I am... emotionally brittle. All the time but *especially* with PMS, during which I did smoke a lot. 

I can’t control my emotions and reactions. I feel constantly stressed and anxious. The other day I found myself screaming at my husband over something so incredibly trivial I can’t even recall it - I mean properly screaming and crying at him. In the entire time I’ve known him I’ve never done this before and it was definitely *me* overreacting not him. I feel this way often - I have to physically bite my tongue to keep from crying or unnecessarily yelling at people. 

Did anyone else have this?? When does it stop???

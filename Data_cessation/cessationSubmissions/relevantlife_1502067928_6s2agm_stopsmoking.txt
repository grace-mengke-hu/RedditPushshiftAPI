3 days. Today was actually a piece of cake. I woke up knowing I wouldn't smoke, as I'm still pretty sick. Tomorrow will likely be tough. I will not smoke!

I am tired of getting short of breath. I am tired of having a cough. I am tired of the sinus issues that smoking causes. I am tired of wasting so much money. I want to be healthy. I don't want cancer. I don't want to be an addict. 

Tomorrow I will not fucking smoke, dammit!

Day 6 and I am not feeling too great.

First I just wanted to say thank you for all the support on here, I haven't been posting, but just reading other peoples replies on here has really helped. The last time I attempted to quit I made it to around 2 weeks and gave in, but I was feeling very happy and good about myself throughout the process. This time, I am 6 days in and I just feel terrible. I feel extremely depressed and have been smoking way more weed, which really doesn't seem to help for longer than the initial 20 minute peak. I feel extremely demotivated yet stressed at the same time. I have an exam tomorrow morning and I am having difficulty concentrating or really getting into a "study mode". 

I know I am not going to give in, but I am tired of feeling so awful. I started jogging a lot and try to exercise a lot more, but nothing really helps. A part of me is worried I've been self medicating myself with nicotine and that I should go get checked up, but that is probably just the nicotine monster trying to get to me.

Sorry if this just seems like an aimless rant, I would really appreciate any encouragement and advice. Really having a hard time here.

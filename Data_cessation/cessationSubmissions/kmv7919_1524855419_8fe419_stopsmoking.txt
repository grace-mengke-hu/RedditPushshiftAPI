Suggestions or tips please???

Iâ€™m on my 4th day and it started out great. First day waking up with no cravings. Now itâ€™s the afternoon and itâ€™s hitting me really hard. I wouldnâ€™t mind punching a person in the face right now, but I can control being agitated or anxious. I do deep breathing exercises, down a bottle of water, or distract myself. Most cravings pass with ease. What I find difficult is the driving cravings.  I chew gum, suck on a mint or blare music but itâ€™s still really hard. Those cravings last really long. Maybe itâ€™s in my head; Iâ€™m not sure. Was driving hard the first couple of weeks after quitting?  Any tips or suggestions I can try would be so helpful and I would greatly appreciate the advice. 

FYIâ€”I love being a quitter for the first time in my life. ðŸ˜‚

The 2018 resolution

Hey reddit! First of all, pardon my eventual mistakes, english is not my native language. 
I've been a smoker for ~9 years. I went through phases when I smoked more than a packet a day and phases when I smoked like 3 cigs a day. But I've never had the motivation to stop completely for more than 48h. So I'm turning 23 very soon, which means I started smoking pretty young. I've always been in good health, and I'd like to keep it that way. Plus I really want to get over the social smoking thing. I kinda need to prove myself something through this. These last months I've realised how strong that addiction can be, and I kinda feel my body getting dirty. I think it's time to get over this, I don't know what to expect, my only hope is that health benefits will be felt very soon to keep being motivated. 
I'm planning on stopping on midnight (maybe sooner ahah)
So I think it's the right place to post that. I'm not looking for tips or anything, I just needed to write it down!

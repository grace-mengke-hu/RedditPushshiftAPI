just bought a pack

Smoked one and now I'm having trouble throwing it away... I don't want to smoke but I'm finding it hard to leave it. Encourage me?

Edit: Well i trashed it. Ended up feeling sick for about an hour. feels nice knowing i let go of them, hopefully no relapses. I love you all on this subreddit... Sucks i had to reset my badge though.

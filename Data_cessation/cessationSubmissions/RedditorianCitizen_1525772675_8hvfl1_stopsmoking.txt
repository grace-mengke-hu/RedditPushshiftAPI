Today WOULD have marked 10 years of smoking.

Instead it marks one month and two weeks free from the stuff.

I rarely crave it anymore, and have taken up exercise and eating healthier to keep my stress level down, have actually lost 6 kilos since I quit. But I have sadly gained a bit of a receding hairline due to the first month of stress, or aging, I'm at that point in my life, who knows? I'll blame the cigarettes, just for the convenient excuse.

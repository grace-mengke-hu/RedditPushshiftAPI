Over ten days, still feeling anxious and moody.

Tuesday at 3:00 PM it'll have been 11 days with no nicotine (although it will say 11 days at midnight, don't know if there's a way to adjust that). And I am still finding that I can often control the cravings quite well, and even sometimes get craving but just don't want a cigarette at all. But I seem to be getting mood swings. Sometimes I feel really anxious and get a feeling of general hopelessness, which can make work and daily activities quite a task. Other times I get very irritable for no apparent reason for short periods of time. And what baffles me the most is occasionally feeling really content, just out of the blue, even more so than I did when having that first smoke in the morning.

Are these mood swings normal? When will they fade?

No, thank you - I don't smoke.

The title is pretty much my new mantra around smoking.  I quit smoking 12-30-2016, but I'm calling myself a non-smoker and affirming over and over again, "I don't smoke."  When I get a craving - "I don't smoke."  I have smoked since I was a teenager, with a couple of short-term "quits."  I quit for 2.5 years at one point!  I want this -- I want to be a non-smoker.  Non-smokers do not smoke.  It's really that simple.

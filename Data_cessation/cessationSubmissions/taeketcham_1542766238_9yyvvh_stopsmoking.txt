HELP NEEDED, quit by Juuling and lost it on a trip.

I started smoking when I was 12, I got a Juul in July to help me quit, and I haven’t had a death stick in 3 months. I’m now 17 and on a family trip in Atlanta, and I left my Juul at home. If anyone in Smyrna/Marietta can get me a starter kit, please PM me.

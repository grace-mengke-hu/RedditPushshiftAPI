Has anybody quit and stuff tasted...wrong?

Not just different but straight up wrong. I just ate some watermelon and it was BITTER. Like on the level of accidentally biting into a lemon seed bitter. I tried to chase it with some peanut butter but that tasted wrong too.,.not bitter but really...itâ€™s hard to describe...bland, I guess. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How long does it take to go away?

In the middle of hurricane Harvey and having been craving two packs of smokes.......

If I smoked one, I'd smoke 2 packs right now. Just realized yesterday I hit 5 months too.  I've been locked up in this house now since Friday evening, over 17 inches of rain, road closures etc.... worried, bored, emotional etc... but I'm holding strong...

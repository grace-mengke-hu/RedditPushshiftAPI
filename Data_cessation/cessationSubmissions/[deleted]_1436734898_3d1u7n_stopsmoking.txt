Relapse after 80 days, im quitting again!

Gonna have to reset my timer after around 80 days. 
A buddy of mine died last friday.
He was ill, and i started working nights at his place since he needed around the clock care, this was about four years ago.

Nedless to say i was very sad and got proper fucking pissed at the bars afterwards.

Guess i thought it would make me feel better or something.

Fuckit im strong enough to quit again.

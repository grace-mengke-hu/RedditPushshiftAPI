Day 1, for the last time!

Smoked my last cigarette before bed last night, and have had my first morning without one in a few years.

Have been smoking for 10 years, and never really wanted to quit even as they destroyed my finances ($20 a day while unemployed for 6 months did a number on me!), but finally decided I've had enough of them.

Read Easyway for the second time, and really feeling it now. Can't wait to see the numbers on my badge increase. Wish me luck!

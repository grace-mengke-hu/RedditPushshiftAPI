Talk me into not smoking...

im 18, i want to smoke really bad man,i keep watching cig reviews. Go to Tobacco sub reddits and i almost think about it all the time, i know it will kill me. My dad was a surgeon, he was really descriptive about what happens what happens when you smoke, it grossed me out! and now im just about walk down to the 7-11.. so please, try to make me not do this.. and sorry, this is the only sub reddit i could think of to post this too, if there is another, please do tell 
Edit:Sorry if i seem to Over dramatic i just read it over and it sounded sappy

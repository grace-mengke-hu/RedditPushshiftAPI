What have I done?! ðŸ˜«

I am on day 97 of the quit. I've been through many a stressful time and I haven't succumbed and haven't really thought about it either. The last few days I've been under so much pressure from the mother in law about weddings and just in a really bad place (which is a whole other story!) and he last few days I've been craving like mad! Tonight after work things went from bad to worse and I can only describe the feeling as wanting to take control and do something bad to myself and I just couldn't find any release! I rushed to the shop in a rage and bought 20, they were Â£9! They didn't have 10s. I have smoked 4 tonight and it's weird I fit straight back into being a smoker, no drama or anything but I'm really disappointed with myself that I've literally put myself back to square one. Really gutted! :(

I quit smoking, and my life turned to the better.

It's been over a whole month, after smoking for 7 years. 7 years may not sound long to many, but it's 35% of my entire lifespan. I loved smoking, it smelled nice (what the ...?), it gave me a reason to take 5 minutes off every two hours at work and I was always outside enjoying the fresh air!
I was never going to quit. Smoking just felt too nice. Besides, I didn't really want to go through the struggle. 

I was getting pretty tired of listening to people nag about me smoking. "You're so young, you don't want to smoke your whole life. No one wants a lawyer that smokes. Do you have any idea how much money you've spent?" 

November 11th, I decided to buy an electronic cigarette. I got in the mail two days later, November 13th. The same day, I found out that the liquids in my country don't include nicotine.
Fine. I'll just smoke as well. 

November 16th, approximately 5pm, I smoked my last cigarette. 
Since then, the following things have changed:

* I can smell things! I have bought 6 scented candles, I've stood in the shower and sniffed my shampoo, and I can smell a smoker from a mile away. (Literally.. Almost ;) )
* I realized how rude I was when I smoked. Did I really blow the smoke into other people's faces, light a cigarette when I was walking in front of someone? Did I really have to stand as close to the door/entrance as I possibly could, forcing everyone who walks inside and out to walk through the cloud of smoke?
* I can sing at the top of my lungs to Adele when I'm driving! 
* I actually have money to do other things? Like, buy concert tickets? And a bit better (and therefor expensive) Christmas gifts for my family, AND friends now?!?!
* My teeth are getting white. 
* I don't need to wash my clothes every other day (due to the smell) - and therefor saving a lot of detergent and water! Save the planet.
* I walked up 5 floors today, and it was not even hard. I can run without giving up after half a minute! 

There are so many other things that have changed, and I hope this makes someone, even if it's just one person, quit smoking. There are so many benefits to not smoking. 

What has changed in your life? What are the small things that make not smoking worth it?

Let's do this already!

I'm quitting a 28-year habit on Friday. I picked that day because I'm going to have gum surgery at 8 AM and will be drugged up on halcyon, so I figure Day 1 will be easier since I will be sleeping all day. I've read Alan Carr's book and it made sense to me, so that is why I'm excited. I've asked my friends to text me randomly the first week with "Isn't it marvelous?!" And I'll be checking back in here to watch that badge number go up!

I haven't had a cigarette in 53 days and I feel great!

It was relieving being able to tell my family on Thanksgiving that I hadn't had a cigarette in a month or so. My body feels so much better! My breathing is coming easier and I have been incredibly shocked at how much more energy I have now. The scent of cigarettes is leaving my coats and clothes, as well as my car. Now, when I smell someone who has freshly had a cigarette, all I can think about is how disgusting the scent is and I feel rather ashamed of having smoked for the seven years I did. Reading the posts in this subreddit has helped me mentally with dealing with cravings. I really appreciate what you all are doing for the Stop Smoking community and for the support that all of you offer. I feel that I can hang onto this and never have a cigarette again!

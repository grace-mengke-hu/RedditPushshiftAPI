Repetition circle.

I write this article for people who had tried stopsmoking a lot of times. But yet did not sucseeded.

General ideas:
1. Each day that passed after quiting decresing the probability of your comeback.  
   - from 1d to 21d is a hard withdrowal fase. ( the highest risk of comback)
   - 21d to 60d is a mild withdrowal fase ( comeback due to your habbit. Your body did the withdrowal work, but your brain is still smoking. You did not get rid of an internal image of smoker)
   - 60d - 180d  unstable remission ( comeback on ocasions, inner thought that smoking helps to owercome difficulties.)

   -180d - 360d  begining of stable remission 
360d+ ex smoker (rare comebacks)

2. Smoking is the drug addiction. Narcologist can help you. 

3. Do more exercise. When you are running, you will have no intention to smoke.

4. You should never give up trying. If you failed, tell the failure story to yourself,  write down where was a trap. Be carefull next time. If u failed<180d  Maybe you should change the withdrowal part.

5. If you did smoke once ocasianaly after you quit (>180d), you should not smoke again. 

I guess it might be helpfull to somebody.

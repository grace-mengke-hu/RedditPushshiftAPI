Craving turning into panic attack and yes, I've had a glass of water and went for a brisk walk ...

I still have to get back to my office for three more hours and come back again tomorrow for eight more, feeling claustrophobic and nauseous all day, like I did today and the day before. It's only been four days and I'm already exhausted. It's like I need a break from the anxiety but when the work day is done, I still have to get in the car and crave a cigarette, and get stuck in traffic and crave a cigarette, and get home and crave a cigarette... I really wish I could just ride this out sleeping, but I can't even do that because nights have been so shitty.. and then I read posts from people on week three or four saying how much of a rollercoaster it still is and I just cannot fathom how I'm going to muster the strength to have another day as shitty as today has been. 

I'm truly sorry for the discouraging rant but I need to have it in writing, if only to persuade myself not to relapse by remembering how shitty early stages feel. sigh.. 

Edit: Thank you so much for the kind words. Some of the things you guys said really meant a lot and helped me hang in there :) I'm very happy I posted here instead of giving up and having a cigarette. I feel much better today.

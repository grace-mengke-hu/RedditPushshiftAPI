Does anyone think qutting apps are actually ineffective at times?

I like to have a precise time that I've been clean of nicotine for, but i also can't help but it sometimes makes me crave a cigarette when I wasn't before. If i check my phone and wasn't craving at that time, ill check the app and start thinking about it - which is still making me feel like a smoker. Sometimes I feel as though it's better not to have such apps and just make yourself try to forget about the addiction that you have/once had.

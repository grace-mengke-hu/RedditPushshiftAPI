Quitting today.

Quitting dip this very moment. Been planning for awhile and I'm going to be posting updates everyday until I can finally kill this beast. I know this is a quitting smoking sub however I couldn't find a quit dip sub. All the same in the end. I just took my last dip, I suppose it's time to test my willpower. 

I'm mostly quitting for my Fianc√© as she absolutely hates it and I'm quitting because I'm tired of something so trivial controlling my life. 

Here's to many more days nicotine free!

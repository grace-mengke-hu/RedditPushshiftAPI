Tell me all the great unintended benefits you got when you stopped smoking.

I've done really good so far but this morning I just really want a cigarette. I want it so badly I feel like I could cry. 

But I don't really want it. I want to plan vacations and not worry about how close the hotel room is to a smoking area, I want to take my kid somewhere and not wonder how long I'm going to have to stay before I can sneak out to smoke, I want to not be chained to a damn cigarette! 

So help keep me on track, tell me how quitting made your life better (other than the obvious health benefits).

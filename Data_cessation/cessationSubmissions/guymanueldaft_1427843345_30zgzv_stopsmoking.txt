I've quit smoking sober, but I need help quitting cigarettes when I'm drunk!

I am in a weird limbo of quitting smoking: I have been a sober smoker for 2 years now, having only one cigarette when fully aware and hating it, but have definitely been a drunk smoker. That is to say that, when I drink, which isn't too often, I smoke like a fiend. My body craves that rush that felt so good during intoxication, or so I always tell myself, and I end up either spending the night bumming cigarettes or just heading out to a gas station to buy a pack, which I will usually smoke most of by the end of the night. And I wake up feeling physically awful and shitty about my lack of restraint.

I am lucky enough that I don't feel any physical withdrawal symptoms these days (I used to get the worst withdrawal periods when I started trying to quit years ago), but I have these terrible cravings when I'm drunk, and I'm too stupid to reason with myself because, hey, I'm drunk! I thought it might have been an association thing, and if I spent some time away from drinking, it would get me away from smoking during drinking. So I quit drinking for three months just to see if I could have a few drinks without the cravings. No good.

So what I need now is advice on how to quit cigarettes in my drunken state. Anybody have any advice on techniques, ways to distract yourself, substitutions that will work in social environments, etc., that help especially when you're intoxicated and craving a smoke?

Thinking about stop smoking

Hi all guys, today is my first day(for the nth time), but I want to seriously try another time.

I noticed that every time I tell myself "ok today stop", anxiety and fear about stopping embraces me. It makes thinking about pointlessness of life without cigs. Such a s****y tought, I know, but is what I feel.

How do you manage these sort of thoughts, if any?

Now it's time to reset my badge and restart my journey. Day 1

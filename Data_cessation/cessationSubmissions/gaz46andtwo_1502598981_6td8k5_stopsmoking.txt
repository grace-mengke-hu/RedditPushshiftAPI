I can't recommend this book enough...

The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. I bought it on audible for 9 bucks after I had quite and was on the patches. I'm only 6 chapters in and I've already dumped the patch and my vape. I also will say that earlier this week I got pretty sick and that seemed to help a lot as well. Anyway this book is amazing and my brain has done a total 180. Even though I'm only 6 days of no nicotine I feel like a non smoker. I don't crave, I don't have the "monster inside hungry for the drug" it feels great actually! So it's been about 18 days since my last smoke and 6 days since the patch. I'm going to give this book all of the credit! I listen to it while I work out which like double helps. It's great, get it. You can quit! There is NO good reason to keep smoking! It's all mental! YOU CAN DO IT!!!

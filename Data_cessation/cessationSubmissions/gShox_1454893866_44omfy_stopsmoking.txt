am i ready

I started smoking when I was 19, it started out as fun with my friends, we'd smoke and they'd leave and then I'd never think of cigarettes. I used to think, "how do people even get addicted??" I'm 23 now, and gradually after about a year and a half, I was hooked. I started smoking every day, and over time I got to the point I was smoking half a pack a day. Sometime last year, I got a super bad cold and quit for a few days, I've gotten to the point now where I don't smoke when I drive anymore, or smoke at home, but work is my trigger. I feel it the worst right before I clock in to go to work, and when I'm bored at work and there is nothing to do. I'm down to like 1-3 cigs a day, and I just keep telling myself that's not that many, but I know I'm bullshitting myself. My boyfriend hates it, and wants me to quit. I think I'm ready, I'm just not sure... I haven't had one since yesterday afternoon, and I just keep going between wanting a cigarette and really quitting

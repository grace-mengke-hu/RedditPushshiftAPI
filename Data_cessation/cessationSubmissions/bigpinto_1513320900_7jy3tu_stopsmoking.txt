now that I have quit, what should I do during long road trip?

now that I have quit cigreetes and got divorced, I am thinking about going for a long road trip to Las Vegas over christmas (22nd to 26th). Naturally I will be going alone since I don't know anyone who would go with me.

What should I do during the trip? just smoke a few? or what should I do in las vegas to keep myself busy as a single divorced guy who has quit smoking recently and doesn't really gamble much?

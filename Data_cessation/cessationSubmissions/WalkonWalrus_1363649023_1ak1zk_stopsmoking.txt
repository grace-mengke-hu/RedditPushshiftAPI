Trying to stop smoking, wick/coil fell out of my e-cig; I have it but need to re-coil it around the lighter area. Anyone know how to do it?

Either I fix this now or I'm going back to the packs. Ive only had this a week and a half, tried to clean it and the damn wick fell out of the fucking thing! Its a eG0-CE4 buck naked ecig

Cold Turkey: Day 6 update.

Overall things have been going great. I feel way more energized. I joined  gym and am planning on going there daily...I definitely have more energy, and am enjoying life much better. But this isn't to say that there haven't been a few close calls. I went out to the clubs last night with a bunch of smoker friends and I felt proud that I didn't smoke the entire night even though I was drinking pretty heavily. However on my way back home (a friend was driving me home) I found myself THIS close to asking him for a cigarette. It's like I was contemplating whether or not I should ask him the whole way. Thankfully I didn't but I have NO Idea where that came from!!!!! I know that I would have definitely regretted it. So despite all the victories it's clear that I am most definitely not out of the woods quite yet.

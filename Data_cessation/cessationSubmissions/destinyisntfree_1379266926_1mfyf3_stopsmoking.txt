Okay, it's been nearly 24 hours

I have been exclusively on an electronic cigarette since about 3p yesterday, and it is about 2p today now.  I figured the first 24 hours would be the worst, so I wanted to make sure I was making it through that before requesting my badge, but I just sent it because I think I am okay.  I have no regular cigarettes in my house anymore, my husband smoked them.  I am not planning to buy anymore, either.

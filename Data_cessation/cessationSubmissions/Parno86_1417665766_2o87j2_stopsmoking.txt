Second attempt

So I was a social smoker for around 5 years. I would rarely smoke during the day unless I was super stressed. But on a weekend or a night in the pub, in company of other smokers I could do 10-20 in a night depending on my mood.
I quit on Boxing Day 2012 and lasted until Nov 2013 when I moved to Malaysia. Back to smoking indoors, everyone smokes, it was tough. I lasted around 2 weeks before I had my first puff. So just over one year of smoking again, I've decided to quit again. I've been smoking more casually this time. 3-4 most days, then if I'm in the pub 10-20 a time. So generally 50-60 per week.
I'm 11 days stopped now and I'll admit it has been pretty easy luckily. The main problem is that I feel like shit. Cold all the time even though it's 30degC and 80% humidity. Bad cough, wheezing all the time. No appetite. Running nose. Etc etc. ugh. Anyone else had this? I'm not a sicky person, haven't had the flu for years. Usually ill maybe once every 2-3 years.

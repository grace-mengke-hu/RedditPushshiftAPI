Why bother to continue?

There is a voice inside my head right now that is asking me why should I bother to continue to quit smoking.  I enjoyed smoking and the relaxation that came from it as well as the people I meet while smoking.  I also feel that after 26 years of smoking that my lungs are totally fucked and what is the point?  I already know my fate as a smoker and for some reason it does not seem to bother me, or at least that voice inside my head telling me to get out of bed and go buy a pack.

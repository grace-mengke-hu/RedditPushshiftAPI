Can smoking one cigar after 2 months be that bad?

hey r/stopsmoking reddit. This is the first time I've quit for longer than a day. It's been almost 2 months and although the urges have gotten less frequent, I still have them.

Is smoking just one cigar going to worse my addiction that much? How is it like to relapse after that long?.

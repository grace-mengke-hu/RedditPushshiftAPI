I smoked.

So, my husband and I got into a really horrible fight.

I walked to the convenience store, bought a pack & a lighter, and lit one up on the walk back home.  *HOLY SHIT*.  Cigarettes do *not* taste as awesome as I remember...the taste was absolutely vile.  Despite 15 years of smoking, my lungs could not man up, and I started coughing with every puff.

I had three drags and had to throw it away.  It just really wasn't worth it.  One of the things that kept me going these 2 months was the knowledge that the cigarettes I was craving would likely not live up to the hype in reality.  I can say that I was right about that.

Still not sure why I even did it...I didn't even really want to smoke...but felt like I "was supposed to" or "should".

Anyway, I am not resetting my counter unless I smoke again.

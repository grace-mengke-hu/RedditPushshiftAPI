Over a year smoke free and still craving a cigarette

With the seasons changing and the weather suddenly feeling so nice I can’t help but miss my little breaks sitting outside. The fall/winter season is the hardest for me. Obviously I don’t miss the way smoking made me feel or constantly smelling like cigarettes, but I miss me time. I feel like a trash human craving them so badly, especially while holding my daughter, and it I feel like a drug addict, but I haven’t broken. It is possible to quit, some days are just harder than other I guess.

Just wanted to share these feelings with a community that understands.

I've had my last cigarette

Sorry for my third post in about a day but I've just finished reading Easyway and just had my last cigarette. I was really doubtful when I started reading it and what people were saying but I feel really different from every previous "last cigarette" I've had. I know this time it is my last. No more cutting down, no more "one more to beat the cravings". I've got my badge now and I'm not going to be resetting it. :)

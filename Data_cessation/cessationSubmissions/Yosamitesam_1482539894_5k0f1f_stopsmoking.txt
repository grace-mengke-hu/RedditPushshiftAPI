This is the first year in 36 years I haven't smoked!

Hey I made it a whole year without any nicotine! And this from a guy who tried hundreds of times to quit but couldn't make it more than a day or two. I guess the reason I have been successful this time is I was just so sick and tired of how they made me feel that I just couldn't smoke them any longer.I always thought if I could make it three weeks I would be over the cravings and it would be easy. It's not easy! But, if I can do it, you can do it too! 
I look at it this way, if someone were to ask me, if I could go back in time, would I smoke that first cigarette all over again? I would say definitely not!! Well I get to make that choice again today and the days going forward and the answer is I will not smoke even one! Thanks people in this sub. Good luck to all of you! YOU CAN DO IT!

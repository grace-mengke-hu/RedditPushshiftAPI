What have you gained since you quit?

Instead of focusing on the withdrawal symptoms can we take a minute and share how our lives have improved?   

Here's mine-

breathing much easier, 
free from the obsession, 
much more free time,
massive pride,
feel much calmer, 
I smell good! 

I think this could help people on the fence about quitting or those in the most important first few days, please share your positive gains!

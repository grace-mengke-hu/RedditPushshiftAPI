Pam from Great American Smokeout documentaries...anyone remember her last name?

In the 90s my health teacher used to show videos about the declining health of a woman, Pam (I'm pretty sure it was Pam), and the effect smoking had on her family and future. What's her full name? We used to watch them around the time of the Great American Smokeout. 

I'd really like to find these videos. I quit on 1 Aug and have been reflecting on the time when I thought I would never start smoking.

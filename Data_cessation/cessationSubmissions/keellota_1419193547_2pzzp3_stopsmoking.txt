So reading online it seems like cravings are the worst part of quitting, but I don't really understand what they are or feel like. Are they moments of loss of willpower to keep from smoking?

because like for me, the worst part is definitely the constant brain feeling like a mushed potato thing. What I'm saying is, I don't just have cravings and then I'm fine for X amount of time-- I'm just in a constant, brain-splitting haze.

Oh yeah, and this is day 1 again except for this time cold turkey instead of using gum to combat said brain-splitting haze. Because fuck nicotine

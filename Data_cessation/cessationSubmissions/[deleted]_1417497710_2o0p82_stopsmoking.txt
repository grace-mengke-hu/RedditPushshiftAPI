Want to quit...don't really know how.

I want to quit but am finding it very difficult as everyone around me is smoking as well. I went from smoking 3 packs a day (about 4 years ago) when I became pregnant (3 years ago) I quit for one year and then the past 2 years I picked it up again. I only smoke about half a pack a day now. 

I can go 3 maybe 4 days without a cigarette and then I get incredibly cranky and grumpy. I mean, off the wall full blown bitch grumpy. That's usually when I break down and start smoking again. 

My whole family smokes as well and I usually get my cigarettes from them also so it's like, even if I don't buy a pack, I still have easy access. This is making it very difficult to quit.

I want to know if the "cranky" period will end? How long will I remain grumpy and why does this always happen? How long do I have to quit smoking to not crave them anymore?

Automatic Response; I always accept a cigarette or ask when around a smoker...

Hey all. Been a smoker for about 6-7 years. Started around 15-16. I am now 22. 

I'm not the heaviest smoker; When i first started it was just a couple a week but I honestly loved nicotine from the first cig. The headrush, but ultimately the overall calming, yet alertness effects smoking gave me.

As the years went by I would smoke 5 a day at most. This is nothing compared to most people I know. I really want to stop, but now that I work in retail, I always seem to be going outside during breaks or lunch to smoke. I stopped buying packs a month ago, but all my coworkers smoke and give out cigs to those who don't have one. It's almost like an automatic response and I just autopilot my ass outside, even though I tell myself that I'll just chill in the breakroom and not smoke. 

Any of you guys have this "autopilot" function when it comes to smoking? I'm still young so I'm sure it isn't as hardwired into my brain, I hope. If any of you have any advice, I would love to hear from you. I'm starting to think that just willpower isn't enough, or maybe thats just my brain telling me that I don't really WANT to stop just yet.... I dunno, just felt like sharing and hearing back from this community.

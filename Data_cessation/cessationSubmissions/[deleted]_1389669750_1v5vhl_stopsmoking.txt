I ran out of cigarettes, decided to have a go at it

Yes, smoked my last one the day before yesterday and well, decided to not buy a new pack, not really enjoying it lately anyway...

Started coughing a couple of hours back, and well, thought I'd make a "hello-post" here since I'll probably need a place to go and share in the coming hell.

So, hello, I've been smoking for four years, varying amounts but up to a pack a day. I look forward to fresh air, improving my stamina and more taste to food. I'm worried about the mornings most, the cigarette after breakfast is going to be the hardest to avoid I imagine, also a bit worried about weight-gain / over-eating.

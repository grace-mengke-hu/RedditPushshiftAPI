This morning (0930) I received a rejection from a university...

.... It is now 20:18 and I have only just about smoking. 

I'm not going to, I don't want to and I am very upset about this rejection but I have gone all day without thinking about a cigarette to *help me* through this. It has made me realise I don't need it and neither do you. 

**TL;DR shit day but hey didn't smoke :)**

Holy shit... Literally.

The hardest part of quitting smoking is trying to shit. I hate it everytime, I just hadn't shit for 2 days. Wake up this morning and I've got to go. Literally shit 2 bricks and had to plunge and flush 16 times.

But here's to trying to quit smoking again after 10 years of it.

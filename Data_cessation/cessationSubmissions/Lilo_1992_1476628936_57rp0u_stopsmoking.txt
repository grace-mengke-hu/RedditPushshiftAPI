Vaping?

Ok well I actually quit smoking about 5 years ago ðŸ‘Œ but vaped at 20mg e-cig and tank ever since. I'm actually quitting vaping now and wondered if anyone else was in the same boat as me? 

I'm on day two and can't say I'm feeling stressed or craving nicotine, perhaps just hungrier tha normal? I did manage two glasses of wine last night without vaping, which I was surprised at lol! But I'm determined to pack in vaping.

Btw I would strongly advise against swapping to vape instead of smoking. Just go cold turkey and it will be over within a week or two, vaping takes over your life!

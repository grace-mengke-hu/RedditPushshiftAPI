there is always a reason to change

i am 48 yr old reformed 25 yr 1 pack a day smoker. would walk a mile for old joe. would run only if chased (and that wouldn't last long). after 6 attempts over a two year period. i finally smoked my last cigarette in the spring of 2011. my inspiration - my 3 yr old daughter. my tools: e-cig, thursday plantation tea tree toothpicks and the additional support of the program 'picture quitting' where i met with a reformed smoker once a week for about a month and a half. the e-cig got me through the times of extreme difficulty, avoiding that walk of shame to buy a pack just to have one, that is never just one cigarette.

2 months in i started running. never too far, never too challenging. but i had to do something to make a reason for staying quit. i spoke to a runner and they pressed me to challenge myself. and then it really became a growth learning experience. i have fluctuated and sustained some injuries but the personal records are where the work is and i found spinning to fill the times of injury. i have done some races and embrace running during travels as a way to experience  new locations. i can sustain 7:30/mile pace and love the way it makes me feel.

i just went for a physical and am pleased with 119/70 bp with a bpm of 44. i actually have enlarged my heart applying myself to the cardio, strengthened, i have embiggined my heart and it feels good.

i just want you to know it is possible and not only possible but worth it. it is never too late and your health in the end is all you have. i am so fortunate to have been given a second lease. the cigarettes were a dead end quickly approaching and saw no reason to give up a stupid habit, i looked for reasons and they were abundant. quitting is not for losers. don't look at it as quitting. start something new.

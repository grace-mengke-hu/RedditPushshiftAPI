I like smoking! But I realise itâ€™s bad and want to quit! Help!

I hate to admit but I like smoking! I smoke just one per day usually at night and it helps me relax and think back on my day. I need to find a new activity to replace smoking while doing the other things that are an important part of my day! Would love to know how others cope and distract themselves! Any suggestions are welcome. I really do want to quit.

Day 5 - Having trouble today

I'm not sure what it is.  For the first 3 days, I felt much worse, but was motivated and felt good about it.  For some reason, today has been terrible.  I feel tired and just have an overwhelming urge to say fuck it and start smoking again.  I haven't and I'm not going to, but it's strange to me that Day 5 is the hardest so far, not the first 2-3 days.

Just finished Allen Carr's book. Resetting my badge for the last time.

After eight long years and almost $18,000.00 I am finally free. I experienced that moment of elation Carr talks about, and realized it was time. I took my almost full pack and broke all but one. I smoked that final cigarette with a smile on my face, knowing it would be the last time. I am excited to say that I am a non-smoker. I am excited to save my money, get my senses back, stop smelling like an ashtray, stop tasting like an ashtray. I am so excited to know that I will never have to smoke again!! This is best decision I have ever made, and I feel so good about it! I never would have been able to do it without this subreddit, and without the recommendations of all of you to Carr's book. Thank you all!

Edit: Thank you all for your words of encouragement! It hasn't even been 24 hours and I feel like a crazy person. Reading all of your comments helped me remember why I'm doing this. You guys are the best!

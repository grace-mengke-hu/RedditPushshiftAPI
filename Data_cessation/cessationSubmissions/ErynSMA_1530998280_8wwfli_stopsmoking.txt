10 days cold turkey. Still having physical withdrawal. Any suggestions?

Been drinking a bit (a beer here and there) cause that actually seems to help but I was in a movie earlier and was salivating so bad. Never made it this long without a cigarette. Any help/suggestions? I’m trying to do this without replacing it for other habits like gun chewing, been smoking 16 years and I’m just so over this shit. Also using QuitNow for an app. Thank you!

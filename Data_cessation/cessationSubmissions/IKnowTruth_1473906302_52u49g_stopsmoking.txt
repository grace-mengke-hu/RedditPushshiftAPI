Only losers smoke

I did a scientific experiment where I drank alcohol non-stop for a month. Recorded the results and guess what - I never ended up being an alcoholic despite using powerful alcoholic products. I did the same with various types of cigarettes, and it didn't even make me flinch.

Quit your placebo effects. I never touched these items ever again and I realized it was a bunch of crap, pretty much like those who are overweight stating it's impossible to be fit. 

Discipline. Remember it. Am I too harsh? Sorry for not cuddling with you and giving you cookies. Unfortunately, most people in here are dishonest pussies and think that being positive is the way to go even if it means to lie. No. Be realistic and honest to others. That's the only way to help them. 

In other words, man up.

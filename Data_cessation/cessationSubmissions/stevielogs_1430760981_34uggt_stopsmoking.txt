Documenting my Quit

Hey all. Wanna start off by saying that this sub inspired me to finally quit. So good on ya'll. 

Anyways I've decided to record my first three days of quitting and capture my thoughts along the way, in an attempt to hold myself accountable. I'm a film student, so the idea of this project being unfinished would drive me more crazy than the cravings. 

Anyway, I'm about 16 hours into the quit and the cravings are coming in waves but I'm ready for them. Not smoking today!

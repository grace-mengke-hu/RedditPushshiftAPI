I'm freaking out a little - accidentally stopped smoking last week

2 to 2.5 PAD for almost 30 years

I was at a conference last week.  On Monday afternoon I got very ill, by Tuesday morning my company was making arrangements to get me back home before I got everyone else sick.  High fever, terrible cough, chills like I've never had before.

The last cigarette I was able to inhale was that Tuesday afternoon.  I've tried to smoke a few times since Saturday, but simply could not inhale.  I can barely pull air into my lungs without coughing until I throw up - I have no idea why I even tried.

I have plenty of ecigs, with juices from 0 to .24 nicotine.  My mom fully quit using them.  She doesn't inhale her ecig vapor.  I was never able to fully make the switch, though I could happily use it when I couldn't smoke.  I also do not inhale the vapor.  I have only hit the ecig for 9 puffs since Friday.

If I understand what I've read, the nicotine is long out of my system.  I am terribly driven to smoke and crave a cigarette like nuts, though.  

I think I want to quit, but I'm going a little crazy here.  Should I get a patch or something even though the nicotine is out of my body?  I'm confused about what the best course of action is to help me find success.

Thanks for any guidance you can give.

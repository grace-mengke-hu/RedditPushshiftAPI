A confused state of affairs

To this wonderful community, thank you for the support you’ve provided to go on every single minute, hour, craving and day at a time; you’re all truly remarkable.

I’m in here just looking for some more motivation keep going. I quit cigarettes 6 weeks ago, but took up the NRT in terms of vaping at the time. It has been a liberating but still a nervous journey. At this point, I’m just trying to find help on how to quit nicotine and the feeling for smoking for something that will work to make sure I’m free from nicotine and cigarettes while not driving me back to smoking tar and cigarettes again. 

If anyone else has been in a same situation and has any pointers or advice to offer, I’ll be really grateful. Nicotine patches is what I’ve been looking for next in the line with gums as an alternative to fall back upon but I’m open to any other suggestions as well.

Thank you everyone!

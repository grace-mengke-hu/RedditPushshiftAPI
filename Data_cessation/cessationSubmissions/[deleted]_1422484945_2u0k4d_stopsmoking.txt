(TW: self harm) I want to smoke or cut myself.

It just occurred to me that I've only cut myself a couple of times since I started smoking (~5 years ago), and I used to cut myself regularly before that. Smoking and cutting are both forms of self-harm, and I find both of them comforting and relaxing when I'm stressed out. Now that I don't smoke, my urge to cut is coming back. Given a choice between the two, I'd rather smoke than cut myself, but there has to be a third option. 

Smoking or cutting is all I can think about right now. I'm trying to stay distracted and just make it through the day one minute at a time, but this is my third day of feeling like this and it's getting really hard. Any advice?

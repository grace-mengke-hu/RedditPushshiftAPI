I made it through my first week!

I'd been a smoker since I was fourteen. Well, that's when I picked it up. I started smoking heavily when I was eighteen and could legally buy them myself. Last week I turned thirty four and leading up to my birthday I mentally prepared myself to quit. I had told myself and others multiple times before that I was going to quit. Those 'quit dates' came and went and nothing changed. This is the time. I can feel it. My main motivation is my kids. They're four and five and although I never smoked in front of them, they're no dummies. They would soon be catching on as to why Dad is going outside all the time. I don't want them to grow up thinking it's something to do. Anyways, I'm just really pleased with myself. I would encourage anyone who's thinking about quitting to DO IT! Thanks for reading. I'll post again when I make it through week two! Much love.

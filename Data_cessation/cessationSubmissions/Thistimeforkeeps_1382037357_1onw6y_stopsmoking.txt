Really desperate today and I don't know why.

Thought about smoking constantly.  Imagining how it feels (won't go into details, don't want to make someone else crave).  I thought it was getting easier but today has been awful.  On the plus side not one puff and I didn't buy any even when I called in the shop to buy water and mints.

A week some-free. Feeling strong cravings post gym.

So when I used to smoke I would reward myself for going to the gym with a smoke pretty much immediately afterwards for a while. It had been a while since I've returned to the gym, so I've picked up going regularly for the last week. 

Problem is I'm getting very strong urges every time I go to the gym and it's getting harder and harder.

Any advice?

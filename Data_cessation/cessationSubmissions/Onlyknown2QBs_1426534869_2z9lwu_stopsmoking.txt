First real attempt at quitting. Using e-cig.

Hey everyone,

This is my first post. I am 23 and have been smoking since I was 16. For the past 4 years, I have been a half pack to 15/day smoker, and I know you can't just go through life expecting a happy ending when puffing at this rate could cut it short at any time. College has been rough, with many smoker friends and stress that have pushed me deep into addiction. Thinking about the amount of fun I could have afforded and money saved with all that money I spent on smokes makes me depressed. Not to mention how badly I have treated my body. As someone who used to exercise daily, I now lack the confidence to go running and even work out, for fear I cannot perform as well as my former self.

I recently bought myself a fairly nice e-cig at the suggestion of my girlfriend. After a month, I am now down to smoking only 1-2 cigs a day, usually in the afternoon and then after dinner. The pack I'm on has lasted over a week, which I don't think has happened in the past 6 years. Is it okay to be proud of this? I know I'm simply replacing my craving with another delivery method, but the thought of clearing up my lungs and whitening my smile make me want to commit. Anyway, I hope to update when I have gone a few days without any smoke. Reading posts here have been very helpful and inspiring, so thank you in advance!

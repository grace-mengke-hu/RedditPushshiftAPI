want to quit

trying to quit smoking for sometime now.

after smoking a pack a day for 7 years, i had quit cold turkey on the new year's eve of 2016. I went 14 months without a stick. Then I moved. New job, new friends made me pick up smoking again. 

The problem is that everyone around me smokes, my best friends smoke, they come to my flat and are free to light a cigarette. Its hard to resist. But i want to quit. Maybe posting here will help. I have a pack with me right now. So its not a post declaring that I am starting right now. Hopefully, this is the last pack. But, I don't think it will be.

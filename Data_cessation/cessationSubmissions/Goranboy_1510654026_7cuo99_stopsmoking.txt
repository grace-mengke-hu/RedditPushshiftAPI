Phew... Triple digits

I'm just so proud of myself of kicking this bad habit, still struggling with emotional distress and other stuff since I decided to quit at a really low in my life (Injuries, loss of family-members and splitting up with a man I still love...)

but today is a good day! 
It's a journey, my friends. I can do it. You can do it. Let's do it! 

Thanks for all the support on here, you guys are the best!

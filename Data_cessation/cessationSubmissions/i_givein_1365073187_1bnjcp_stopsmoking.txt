Enough is enough

So this isn't the first time I've have posted (anonymously) on this subreddit looking to quit. Two weeks ago I said to myself that these will be the last pack of cigarettes I buy (duty free 10x20 pack) and tonight was the night that I finished them. I feel like I'm in a much better mental state now and feel motivated enough to have the willpower to simply say no.

Tomorrow is going to be a b*tch.

Cold turkey as of two hours ago.

I'm tired of not being able to smell and taste. I'm tired of having to shower so much because I'm ashamed of people smelling me. I'm tired of the lack of energy, coughing and everything else. I'm tired of being ashamed about it. It's not how I want people to see me.

20 years old, pack a day for almost a year exactly. Used to smoke rarely and only socially, got dumped and bought a pack of Marlboros at a gas station a few minutes later. Got hooked. $15 USD/day is just too god damn much for these things I don't enjoy.

I started collecting my empty packs at the start of March, just seeing all of these disgusts me.

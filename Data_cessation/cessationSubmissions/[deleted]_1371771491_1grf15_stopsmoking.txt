Getting tougher every day

This is my fourth day without smoking. Obviously for the first few days I was happy. I felt motivated and free. Now, though, I feel this voice in my head telling me to smoke, and it gets stronger every day. It isn't a physical thing. I feel fine since I quit- better probably. I think it really is a purely psychological thing. I spent most of my youth romanticizing the image of a cynical author, comedian etc. sitting in a lounge chair with a glass of whiskey and a cigarette. I think that's the voice telling me to smoke. I believe this since I'm not hearing "c'mon it's only one. It won't hurt you." I very plainly hear "Fuck it, go buy a pack. Be miserable later." SO, I guess I'm just wondering if this is something that will go away, or if I should just strap in and enjoy the misery?

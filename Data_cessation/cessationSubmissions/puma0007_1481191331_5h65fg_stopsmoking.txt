My 4th day after 18th years being smoke slave..

It's been my 4th day without smoke..after several attempts before, this time is the most successful one..
Really without a single puff for 4th days..I can't believe myself..but still many temptations ahead..I can't even sleep yesterday nite..only 4 hours..
Hope it will end soon enough the craving..

This isn't so bad. Is day three really that bad?

I put out my last smoke around 8am June 30th, it's now 1am July 2nd, and I feel pretty good. I work nights at a gas station and I have little desire to reach 2 feet behind me and buy a pack.

Cold turkey, 15 cig a day smoker for the last 4.5 years. 

Something must be wrong, it shouldn't be this easy, should it? I'm somewhat irritable, but no more than I would be after not getting enough sleep. I'm not complaining, but what gives? Am I in for a rude awakening on the infamous "day 3" tomorrow? 

As a side note, oh my god I'm hungry ALL THE TIME. When does this hunger stop?

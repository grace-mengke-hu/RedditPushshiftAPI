How to quit smoking when working nights?

Hey fellas, First post here. I usually smoke ~10 cigs a day on an off day or sometimes my e-cig when I remember to buy the juice, but when I have to work I often have 18+ sometimes 36hr shifts (I'm a roadie) I just can't resist the urge to take a smoking break with my colleagues or more often than not i just have a cig in between my lips through out the entire shift. I guess it kinda keeps me awake. Anyways next day after I wake up I feel like shit my breath stinks and I regret smoking so much last night - I then proceed not to smoke that day, feel better about myself and forget all about it the next shift I have. Rinse and repeat. 

So my question is how do I go about quitting? Cigarettes is what keeps me awake during the long shifts and what gives me smoking breaks. Has anyone ever been in this situation?

P.s. I've tried to just smoke my vape during work but I can't really keep it in my mouth whenever I have to have both hands free and pulling it out and back in my pocket is a bother really and it's quite a bit bigger and stiffer than a pack of cigs that I can put in my back pocket or a rolled up sleeve. Plus the battery dies in a lot less than 18 hrs. Thanks in advance and sorry if I've made spelling mistakes English isn'tâ€‹ my first language.

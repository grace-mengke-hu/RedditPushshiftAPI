Do the cravings ever go away or what?

I have stopped smoking for quite a while now and while I feel much better physically and perform much better at sports, the cravings haven't gone away. It's been a few months and everytime I get angry or stressed I immediately want to smoke. I haven't given in but it just feels like I haven't "quit" such that I am not addicted anymore, but rather I just am resisting smoking and will continue to have to resist the rest of my life. Does this ever go away or what?

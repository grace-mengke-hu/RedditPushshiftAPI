Looking for support! I need to stop!

I'm a student with a busy schedule. I quit for about 6 months then starred again. At about a pack a day. Feel gross all the time, energy levels are down. Just want to stop and replace the hour+ I spend a day on 30 minutes of exercise and self care. Any encouragement would be great!

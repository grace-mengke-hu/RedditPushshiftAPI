I always thought I would be a smoker

I have been smoking for 24 years. Started when I was 16, and have been smoking two packs a day for many years.  I have never had a desire to quit. I have never tried or even thought about quitting.  I truly loved smoking and figured I would smoke for the rest of my life.  It was just my way of life and every puff was fantastic.

I don’t know why, but a few days ago, I just all of a sudden decided to quit. Almost like a switch just went off in my head.  I took a full pack and flushed them.  I found this subreddit and support tools online and gave it a try.  It’s only been a few days, and it’s agonizingly hard, but I have not smoked. I can’t believe how good I feel.

Thank you to all on this subreddit. Your posts have helped me so much and I know they will continue to guide me through the days and weeks ahead.  Stay strong!!

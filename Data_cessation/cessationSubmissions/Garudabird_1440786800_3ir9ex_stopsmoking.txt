I would never advise anyone to smoke but...

If I hadn't been a smoker for 20 years I wouldn't appreciate just what an amazing feeling it is to be able to breath again when out for a run. All those never smokers have no idea how good they've got it!  50 days strong, here's to the next 50 and forever.

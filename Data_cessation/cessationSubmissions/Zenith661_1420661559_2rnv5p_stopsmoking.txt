Nicotine withdrawls

Did anyone else feel physically sick after quitting? Today marks a week and for the past half of it I've been constantly getting nauseous, lightheaded and getting headaches. Yesterday was definitely my "moodiest" day and today my cough has started to get persistent. Not having any cravings so far today though! Anyone else who made it past the first week or too feel this awful? I can't wait for it to be over.

Had the same cig in my hand for 2 hours now.

Yep. Obviously I don't want it cause I seem to be finding any excuse not to light it. But here I am holding it for over 2 hours. 
Bad night. 
Tired.
Headache, cravings all day
Exam tomorrow, not ready for it.
Fight with husband. 
Just got it in my head I was gonna smoke "just one" 
still wanna be a non smoker
real proud of myself for quitting. 
even if I do light it I guess I start right back over quitting. 

Havent lit it yet- need help putting it down.

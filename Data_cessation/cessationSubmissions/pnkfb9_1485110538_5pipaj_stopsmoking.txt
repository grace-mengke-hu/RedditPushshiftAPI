24hrs free but is a fuckin hell

I succesfully quit smoking weed 5+ months ago. Now I am struggling  A LOT with cigs. It seems impossible, and I know that I am lacking in willpower, but is terrible. I can do a full day without smoking, but the second day I always smoke. argh!

Also, I feel the heart racing, anxiety, dizziness and a lot of irritability.

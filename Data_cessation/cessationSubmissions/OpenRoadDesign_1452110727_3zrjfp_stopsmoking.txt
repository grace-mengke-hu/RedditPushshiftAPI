Using E-Cigarette.."oh you haven't really quit"

I've tried quitting many times before. This time I'm trying the vapor method with low nicotine oil. I"m 32 and extremely determined to quit this time around. I'm sick of yellow teeth and throwing my money out the window.

 But I actually had a friend say to me "that I wasn't really quitting smoking" because of the e-cigarette. And that I'll probably "go back to regular cigarettes eventually." They are a smoker as well. 

What do you folks think? I plan on reducing the oil to 0 nicotine over the next couple of months. Then getting rid of the e-smoke all together. I've done cold turkey so many times and I know it doesn't work for me. 

Is there hope by reducing with vapor?

p.s. This "friend" won't be hearing from me for a while.

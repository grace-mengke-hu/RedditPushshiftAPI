Two Months Now

I was a two pack a day smoker for 35 years (now 53) and had heart attack in early July and almost died multiple times.  Flat lined on my driveway three times getting CPR from a passerby, made it to the hospital but by then was in cardiac arrest and unable to breath so they put me on a ventilator.  There I sat (pics anyone?) for ten days with no brain activity.  At some point they "froze" me by dropping my body temp to 90 degrees and after ten days I slowly woke up and began breathing on my own.  I slowly (over a few days) realized what was going on but was confused and couldn't remember the last five years.  Over the next week all memories but the week or so leading up to the incident returned to me.  I'm extremely fortunate to alive still.

So, I was forced to quit and am hanging with but damn, is it hard.  I feel empty and alone but luckily have my kids around to help me.  I hope these feelings go away soon.

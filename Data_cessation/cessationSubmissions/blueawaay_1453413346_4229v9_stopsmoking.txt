I'm 16 and i smoke a pack an half/two packets at day. I need to quit. HELP PLEASE

Like i said in the title i'm 16 and i smoke 35-40 cigarettes at day. I've been smoking for 4/5 years and i really want to stop because this is ruining my life, i know it sounds drastic or exagerate but i'm always coughing and sometimes i spit blood, i have short breath and can't even run for 10 minutes or go upstairs without stopping to breath and the worst things is that i can't go for more than an an hour without a cigarette, when i'm at school i say to the teacher i have to go to the bathroom but i actually go to the garden where smoking is allowed during the break, and i basically don't even go home anymore because i don't want my parents to know that i smoke and to get money for the cigarettes i always have to borrow them from my friends, ask strangers and sometimes even steal. I haven't seen a doctor for ages because i don't want my parents to find out i smoke, but i'm very worried right now. I have tried to quit with an e-cig but i just end up using it where smoking isn't allowed whenever i want a cigarette. I even heard that chantix is great to quit but you need a prescription for it so i don't really know what to do, is there a way i can get some good medicine to quit otc? Another way i was thinking of quit was to reduce the number of cigarette by 1 or 2 everyday, is this a good idea? And what are some good remedies for the depression you get after quitting, that just seems to never go away for me, i really need some advice and i would like to hear experiences from people who quit when they were about my age or still living with parents. (I'm sorry for my english, it is not my first language)

Got back on track, thanks guys!

I posted last week about a slip (which I accepted was actually a relapse after talking to the fine folks on this subreddit.)  Kept myself accountable and moved on.  Reset the timer, on day 4 now.  I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for helping me to stay accountable- and if anyone else is struggling and has a slip or a relapse, you can move past it.  Just get back on the horse.

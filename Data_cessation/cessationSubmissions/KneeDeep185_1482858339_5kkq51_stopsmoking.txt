Nearly a month

I'm a day short of 4 weeks without a cigarette, the longest I've gone since May 2013. During that time I went about 2 months, and that's the longest I'd gone since I started smoking, about 15 years ago. I have the occasional dream where I'd been smoking and get weird guilt, anxiety and shame about smoking again. I wake up relieved, but the shame lingers. Right now I can tell the difference between the last time I tried to quit and started again after 2 months is that I'm drinking much, much less, so I have fewer of those "oh well fuck it" moments. My 30th is in early January, and I'm going to be (at least) 30 days smoke free by then. Cheers to 30 more years without cigarettes and never looking back.

To gum or not to gum

Hello all! I've made many half-hearted attempts at running away from tobacco's grasp, cold turkey style. I am completely new here to stopsmoking, so I apologize if this question gets asked once a day, but do you guys normally recommend nicorette gum? Or recommend that a person just stop, without feeding the nicotine dragon inside our bodies at all? Any advice is appreciated.

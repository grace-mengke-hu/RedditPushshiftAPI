The Phantom Need

Bio first.  I am 3 weeks nicotine free using Chantix.  For the most part I feel like this has been a good experience and is helping me.  I still have to battle with craving the head rush of a hypothetical cigarette.

We are talking about the nicotine rush itself.  What takes the place of it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I Like about quitting cigarettes/nicotine:

\-no need to go outside every 1-2 hours, now i go outside every 3-4 hours (probably not very healthy from a biological perspective)

\-I have WAY more energy every hour of the day

\-I can enjoy social gatherings with friends without the subconscious pariah nagging urging me to escape groups of people to go smoke tobacco

\-The ability to walk outside and observe my entire environment (full sensory experience).  This is hard to explain and I think it is somewhat an effect of the chantix, but also though I still attribute it to being free of the nicotine withdrawal.  I associate being free of the nicotinamide receptor slavery with the ability to be alert and aware of my world around me. I can't justify that, but that is what I wish to achieve, the feeling of every literal second being a new opportunity; i.e. Like I am in the here and now; fully conscious; hyper alert.

Things i Do Not Like:

\-Intense hunger cravings trying to fill the nicotine void

\-Wanting to feel a nicotine buzz

\-Feeling bored (I have a little bit more time but a LOT more energy, so I get bored, I've been going for walks at night to watch fireflies to pass time).

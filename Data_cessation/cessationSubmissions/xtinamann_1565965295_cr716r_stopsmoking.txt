First day on Chantix

Im so nervous. I've been reading about the side effects and how the effect different people in different ways. But im so tired of being a smoker. Im tired of smoking just because im bored, or after I finish a chore, or whenever I get in the car. I've tried the patch, it made my arm burn/ tingle. I've tried the gum, it didn't work for me. It's been 10 years, a pack every 2 days, I'm ready. 

It's my first day and im so ready to give up this awful habit. Y'all please wish me luck. I really could use the support.

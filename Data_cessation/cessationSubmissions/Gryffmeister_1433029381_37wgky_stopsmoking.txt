Tomorrow will be day one.

I just had a cigarette and I hate the way it makes me feel and smell. I hate how I worry about what other people think of me while I'm smoking. I've been unmotivated and depressed for too long. Enough is enough, time to make a change! Wish me luck.

Edit: thank you all for the support! You are all awesome :) I'm looking forward to it instead of dreading it now.

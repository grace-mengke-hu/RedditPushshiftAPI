Day 5 Love/Hate this process!

I'm heading into day 6 and kinda struggling. It's not even the nicotine really. It's more boredom and the motions. I could actually feel myself pulling in the smoke earlier, even though I didn't smoke. Hard candy, jumping jacks, laundry, walking the dog and doing dishes didn't help!!! It took 30 minutes before it went away. Probably the worst craving yet. Proud I didn't smoke. But started in on the whole "why am I quitting " mental thing. Chantix does help. I can't even imagine going cold turkey considering even with help, it has sucked!

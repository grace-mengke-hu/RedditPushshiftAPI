My Experience With No Smoking For One Week

Hello.

Exactly seven days ago, I smoked my last cigarette at around this time...perhaps an hour or three earlier.  During those seven days, I felt nauseous, weak, and physical pain in my chest.  I was, however, somehow able--and willing--to do so much more than I would have had I still been a smoker.  I became addicted at a young age and let the affliction continue for a little over a decade.  Now, I have gone through seven days without smoking cigarettes and I remember them feeling long, but it has been seven freakin' days...and I am happy about it.  :P

I will continue to do my best for I find motivation in others doing their best.  Thank you.

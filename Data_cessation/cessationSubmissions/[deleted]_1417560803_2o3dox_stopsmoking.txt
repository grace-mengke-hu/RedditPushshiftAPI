Constant panic attacks

So today has been utter shit. I started smoking to help with an anxiety disorder I've had for a while. Everything cleared up for a few months, but recently I've been having a lot of panic attacks again. I think I've had three today but I don't want to smoke. What should I do when I feel like I'm going to die? How do I stay away from another cigarette?

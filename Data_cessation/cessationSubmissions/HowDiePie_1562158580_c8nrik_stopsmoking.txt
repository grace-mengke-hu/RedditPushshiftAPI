Can I just say, I haven’t smoked for 30 days and the real every day craving is COMPLETELY GONE. Rather I’m either at the gym or just busy with out the thought of cigarette.

However, I was out last weekend and bummed off a cigarette from a friend, because I usually started smoking when drinking with friends and such. But that was a one off, and i am fairly confident that was just some years of habit and urgency to keep busy with alcohol than my wanting for nicotine. 

I am so happy that I am so confident about myself and my independence from cigarettes. I gave myself a pass and got right back into living and thinking healthy. Excuse me please :)

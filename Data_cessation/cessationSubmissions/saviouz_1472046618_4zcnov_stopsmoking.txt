1 month and still groggy

It's been just about over one month since I last touched a cigarette, but it's only got marginally easier. I don't feel like I want to smoke and I even threw away a few cigarettes I found laying around the house that I forgot about... but I am always always tired. I can seriously lay in bed for days and not get up at all. I am just not motivated to do shit! 

I have university exams very soon and need to start studying hard today, that's though.. because I used to chain smoke like crazy when studying... oh well. This too shall pass

I curse the day I thought smoking was a cool idea. 
Also I smoked several joints with my friends while on vacation, that contained some tobacco, that sure is having some effect on me right now.

Bye.. good luck to everybody, sorry for the confusing post. I am feeling a bit crazy

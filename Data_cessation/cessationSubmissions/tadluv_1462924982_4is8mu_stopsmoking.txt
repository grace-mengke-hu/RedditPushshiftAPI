Cigarette free for 31 days!

So I quit with chantix and had to stop taking it bc my stomach couldn't handle it anymore. Cravings have been awful after about a week off meds. Considering vaping bc I don't like being so irritable from cravings. Should I just tough this out with nothing in the hopes it gets better, or give the vaping a try?

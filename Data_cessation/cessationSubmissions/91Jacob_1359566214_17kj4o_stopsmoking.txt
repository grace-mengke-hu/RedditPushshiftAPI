Finished a pack yesterday and considering dropping smoking. Not sure if I really want to, though. Details inside.

I wouldn't mind testing myself, but I simply cannot imagine myself not smoking in the long run. I love smoking, especially to accompany a drink. I can't imagine myself not holding a cigarette again over the entire summer while chatting with my friends. I guess this is what all addicts say, but smoking is neither ruining my finances or my health (or I just don't give enough of a fuck about these, and just like somebody reserves the right to eat out once a week and spend a little more, I want to be able to buy a pack of cigarettes once in a while).

Could anyone who used to have a similar approach write a little about their situation? I would imagine I'm not unique, and that most of you guy's started not being able to imagine yourselves as non smokers.

Also, people who have actually experienced the alleged benefits of not smoking (health/appearance) speak up as well.

I realise this might be one of thousands of threads of this kind, and my 'not too bothered' approach might piss you guys off, and apologise for this in advance.

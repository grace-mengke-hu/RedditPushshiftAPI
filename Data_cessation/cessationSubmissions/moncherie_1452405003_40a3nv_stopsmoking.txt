Nicotine Gum Question

Tried cold turkey but needed some help so I bought & used nicotine gum.  I ran out recently & am going through difficult cravings again 30+ days inn &  I wonder if I should get some add'l nicotine gum or just power through this.  Inquiring w/nicotine gum users as to how long it took them to be free.

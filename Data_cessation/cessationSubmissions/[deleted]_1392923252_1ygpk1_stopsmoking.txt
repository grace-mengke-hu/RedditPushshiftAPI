The reason I quit smoking

Hopefully this will help some people put into perspective what is meant for ME to quit smoking.  My motivation like many here was to quit for financial reasons.  I simply could not afford it anymore.  My rent was late and when Id realize that, it would trigger my smoking habit.  The stress of it and the looming backlash would stress me out to the point that I HAD TO SMOKE.  This of course is just an example but things like this would come up often and I always just said "fuck it" I'm stressed and need to smoke.  My other horrible trigger was drinking and smoking.  I just always assumed the two went hand in hand.  Have a beer have a smoke and let the cycle repeat.  

Eventually this got so bad that it was time to stop.  It was hard the first few days and a couple spots in between but here was my major motivator.

Where I live Marlboros are $11.00 dollars a pack.  I smoked a pack and a half a day (sometimes more sometimes less but thats the average)

So $16.50 a day x 30 days in a month = $495.00 x 12 months = 

$5,940.00.....  That was it for me.  After factoring what I was spending on beer/alcohol over the same amount of time, the number was north of $6,500.00.

So in short everyone is motivated by different things in their to quit.  This was mine. I wont even get into what it has done for my health but i feel like a new man.  No more smell, no more gross breath,  taste buds are back and my overall life is just different..in a better way.

Find your triggers and make your mind strong by dealing with them.  You'll only thank yourself in the end.

This too shall pass.

Broke my clavicle because I'm dumb sometimes.

I was given T3s for the pain, but I noticed that I kind of want to smoke when I take them. I've only taken one dosage, but when I did there was a very strong craving that lasted for hours. I told myself I wouldn't smoke today and that it'd pass. I went to bed and the craving was gone when I woke up. Tonight I started getting a craving, so I wrote this post, and since I started typing the craving has passed.

I've had an easy quit so far. The third day, third week and third month are always a little harder for me but I know it gets better. I may try to take half a dose or just take Advil because that seems to do the job.

Anyways, just checking in.

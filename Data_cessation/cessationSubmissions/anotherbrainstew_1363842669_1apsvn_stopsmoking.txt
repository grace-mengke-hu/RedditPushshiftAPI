So my 1000th day is coming up.

Since I quit smoking, I have started lifting weights and have done more than I ever imagined I could before I started. I took up running and completed a 5k in a really respectable time. I found that I had a lot more stamina and was better in bed if you know what I mean. My teeth got whiter and my breath got better. No more burn holes in my car, no more cigarette smell. No more dealing with creepy gas station people. I have saved about four thousand dollars, and probably added years to my life. Even if I didn't add any years to my life, I have definitely added life to my life. 

So if you quit years before me, or you are just quitting today I salute you all and its my truly hope and desire that you all succeed as I have!

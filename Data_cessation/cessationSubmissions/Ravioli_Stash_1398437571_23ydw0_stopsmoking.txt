Missed my 30 day check in, but here's a five week update

Things have been going surprisingly well. I'm a college student so that means the semester is winding down right now. Finals are close and my last papers were due this week and I can honestly say I was nowhere near buying a pack even with the stress I was under. I'm even able to go out to bars without getting cravings which I didn't think would ever be possible. 

Also I've been working out a lot more consistently, alternating running and lifting weights. All in all everything has gone great and I want to thank everyone in this sub for the motivation to keep going.

After 20+ years I finally did it!

In about 30 minutes, it will be officially 7 days without nicotine. This is huge for me considering I’ve never gone more than 7 hours without a cigarette or vape. 

I’m not really someone who posts at all really, but I just wanted to share this with all of you because many of your posts have kept me motivated to not give in. So Thank you all for your stories and words of encouragement.

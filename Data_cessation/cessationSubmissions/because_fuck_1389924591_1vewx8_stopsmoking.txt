Today is my 100th day without cigs.

I had no idea until I requested a badge actually! Quitting was f-ing awful! I am 25 yrs old. I hated it entirely! I wanted to smoke forever and it was extremely hard for me to quit. I tried several times. I craved immensely! I started back up several times but the last time a did, the acetone smell was so apparent that I couldn't ever shake it. I quit for the final time October 8, 2013, 100 days ago. I don't crave any more. And the times I think about cigs now, I feel completely relaxed and in control, a feeling I thought would never come. Good luck!

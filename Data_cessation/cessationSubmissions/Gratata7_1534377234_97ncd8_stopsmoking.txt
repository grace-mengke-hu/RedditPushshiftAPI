How long did it take you guys until you started to feel normal again?

I’m finishing up day 3 right now. I’ve been told the first 3 days are the worst, and they definitely suck. I plan on quitting regardless of how long it takes me to feel normal again. How long did it take you guys until you felt like yourself after you stopped smoking?

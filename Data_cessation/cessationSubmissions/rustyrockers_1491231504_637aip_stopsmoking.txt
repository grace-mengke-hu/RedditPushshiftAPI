4,000 Not Smoked Today

Best commitment to myself ever. I remember all those miserable days where I thought where I am today was like a whole different, out of reach, reality. Well, I'm here. In this new reality of clean smells, smooth breathing and no more ass breath. Friday is my 4 month marker!!!

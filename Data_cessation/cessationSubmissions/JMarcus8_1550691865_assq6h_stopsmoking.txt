What do you 88,000 times a year?

If you take 12 drags off a cigarette, and smoke 20 per day, by the end of the day you will have moved your hand to your mouth 240 times per day. By the end the year, you will have done that hand-to-mouth motion **87,600** times. 

I smoked for 22 years, around 25 per day, so I did that hand-to-mouth motion around **2,409,000** times! No wonder I’ve been “smoking” pen caps and sucker sticks in the last 30 days! I won’t smoke today, or tomorrow, but I should be a little easier on myself too.

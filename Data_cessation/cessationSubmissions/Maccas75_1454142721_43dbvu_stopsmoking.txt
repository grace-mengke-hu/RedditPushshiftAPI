How I kicked the nicotine demons almost 5 years ago

In a recent AskReddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/42rcdr/what_is_something_that_you_were_surprised_about/czci139) I posted briefly about my achievement of quitting smoking 5 years ago.  It was so popular that I decided to post here in an effort to answer some questions and explain my personal quit-smoking journey.  If any of my story or advice helps just one person become nicotine free then mission accomplished!

**Background and the Quitting mindset**

I was a half-pack-a-day smoker.  In Australia, there is a quit smoking campaign with the slogan: *"Never give up, giving up"* - and it is so true! Each time you quit, you get a little better at it until one day you put out your last cigarette and never have another.  Don't let previous failed attempts deter you from quitting - my successful one was about attempt 4 or 5.

**You have to really want to quit for you**  
Not for your kids, spouse or anyone else but *you* (though they will benefit massively as well).  During my failed attempts, I was trying to quit because I felt I needed to ("smoking is bad!"), not because I really *wanted* to.  Try to eliminate putting extra pressure on yourself regarding quitting smoking - don't overthink things.  I didn't even share a quit-smoking FB status until I had a milestone worth sharing - 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months.  I didn't want any unnecessary attention or pressure placed on my new lifestyle.

**Anytime is the perfect time to quit smoking**

"Oh I'll wait until after this stressful period at work".. "My relationship ended, now isn't the right time".. "When I'm older, I'll have more self-control".  *These are all poor excuses we give ourselves to prolong quitting as a result of nicotine addiction talking*.  Now is the best time.  I quit smoking while working in the fast-paced, stressful environment of a fine-dining restaurant for the first time.  Quit *now*.

**Cold turkey**

Myself and so many others have successfully done it cold turkey.  After all, why take more of a drug when you are trying to stop taking it? In the week leading up to my last cigarette, I cut down dramatically until I stubbed out my last one and promised myself I'd never have another.  From then on, I considered myself a *non-smoker*.  Not an ex-smoker, not a smoker trying to quit, but a *non-smoker*.  This mindset is incredibly important!  Once you have quit, you no longer have any association with cigarettes.  In the early days, take it one day at a time.  Doing that soon flowed into weeks, which flowed into months and years!

**Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking**

So much of [Allen Carr's](http://www.allencarr.com/) method helped me and has helped millions of others.  Because I had a short attention span, I just got his DVD out from my local library - you can probably find it at yours, online or as a torrent.  It helped a lot and played a big part in my successful attempt.  I will include some Allen Carr links at the end of this post.

**Why do you smoke? Eliminating these myths**

Once you understand why you smoke and why these are all myths you have formed due to nicotine addiction, you begin to understand the whole concept of smoking better.  Allen Carr goes into this in depth.  I was one of those smokers who could rattle off a whole heap of reasons: it helps me relax when stressed, it helps me digest after a meal, it enhances alcohol and coffee.  Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  This is simply nicotine addiction talking, nothing more.  Continually remind yourself of these myths, especially during the initial nicotine withdrawals.

**Using the health benefits of quitting as motivation**

In just 5 days most nicotine is out of your body.  As each day passes, more and more [health benefits](https://upworthy-production.s3.amazonaws.com/nugget/500429a6142f610002002244/attachments/Smoking_health_benefits_male.jpg ) are taking place.  From taste improvement to less risk of stroke - use these as motivation and milestones to continue on your healthy new path.

**Don't envy your smoker friends**

Once you understand nicotine addiction better, you should learn not to envy your smoker friends.  They are still trapped in the vicious cycle of nicotine addiction - don't envy them.  Don't avoid them either.  I still spent time around my friends when they were smoking in the early days - until the smell of it became more repulsive as time went on.  I ended up just feeling sorry for them still smoking as opposed to seeing them doing something I missed.

**Adjusting to new routines and lifestyle**

It took me about 3 months to feel 100% comfortable with my new lifestyle and routines.  Lollies, breath mints helped a lot at times.  I always kept my cigarettes in my front left pocket - it felt weird having it empty so I kept a large box of tic tacs in that pocket instead.  It satisfied that hand-mouth thing while also giving me super fresh breath!  One thing you gain from quitting smoking is *greater confidence*.  Make the most of this and do new things you never imagined doing before!

**Develop new stress management techniques**

As a smoker, you turned to cigarettes to make you "calm" or to manage a bad day.  In reality, you were already stressed *by* cigarettes due to constant nicotine withdrawal.  They never relaxed you or made a bad day better - they simply replenished the levels of a drug you were addicted to, giving you a false sense of calm.  By smoking, you were simply trying to get to a level of well being non-smokers enjoy 24/7.  *Remind yourself of this fact*.  There are books on stress management, relaxation techniques and there are even psychologists.  Don't be afraid to use these resources.

**Don't fall into the trap of transferring your nicotine addiction onto another addiction**

I did and mine was drinking.  I always overindulged with alcohol and once I quit smoking, this spiralled even more - so after 3 months smoke-free, I stopped drinking alcohol too.  Take up more positive habits or hobbies as opposed to new addictions or making existing ones worse.

**Complement quitting smoking with other self-improvements**

This is the new non-smoker you! Continue on this positive path and make improvements in other areas of your life and reward yourself for achievements in the process! I ate healthier, exercised, bought myself a new wardrobe, read a lot of books on confidence, social skills and jumped back into the dating game.  On my quit-smoking milestones I go out to dinner! Treat yourself when you deserve it and learn to love yourself again.  May sound a bit cheesy, but shit, the process of learning to love and respect myself again played a vital role in successfully becoming a non-smoker.

*Everything written above is my own journey and what worked for me.  Different things work for different people – feel free to pick and choose what elements work best for you.  Cigarettes are not something I even think about these days.  It really is possible to quit smoking and remain a non-smoker.  If the end result is maintaining a nicotine-free life, who cares how we get there!?*

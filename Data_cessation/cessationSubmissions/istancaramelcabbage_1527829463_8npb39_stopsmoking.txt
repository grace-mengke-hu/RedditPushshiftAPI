I feel like crying

I want to bawl my eyes out. It pains me to know that I can't smoke early in the morning with a cup of coffee. I hate that I can't have a cig late at night, staring at the moon while listening to some music. 

I don't want to quit. It's just that I disappoint my parents enough as is, so I promised my mother that I'd quit when she caught me 2 days ago, cold-turkey. I'm still a minor so it's not like I can go against her wishes.

Cigarettes were the only good thing going on in my life for a while. I had suicidal thoughts before starting and I'd self-harm often because I didn't know how to cope with anger otherwise. My self-confidence was at its lowest and I felt like I didn't deserve to live or eat. It all stopped when I started smoking. I felt so good. 

I feel like I'm not quitting for the right reasons. I still don't know if it's worth it. I know about all the health concerns and that I could die of cancer, but does it even make a difference when I'm just gonna kill myself either way?

I can't possibly keep this up. But I have to if I don't want to be a failure in my parents' eyes again.

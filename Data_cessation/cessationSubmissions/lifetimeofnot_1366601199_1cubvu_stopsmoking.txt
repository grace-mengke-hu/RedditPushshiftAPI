My first week

If you would have told me two weeks ago that I could go a week without smoking I would have called you fucking crazy; yet here I am, still going strong. It wasnt always easy but it was alot easier than I imagined it would be, Ive held off on telling most people because I didnt want to look like a failure in front of everyone but tomorrow I will tell the world: I am smoke free!

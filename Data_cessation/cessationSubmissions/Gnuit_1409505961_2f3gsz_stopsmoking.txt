Melancholia and rage

Hello Reddit. I have lurked this site for several years without posting, and now that I am trying to quit smoking I feel I need to reach out of my comfort zone to get the motivation I need. I have smoked for about 4 years,  but became so addicted to cigarettes that there were times I could think of nothing else. I used nicotine to forget the pain of my real feelings, but now I want that pain.  I never want to see myself staring at ashtrays, every butt on the ground, any source of tobacco like it is some kind of "temptation"....gross! I switched to the e-cig yesterday after months of telling myself I would quit every day. I did actually quit for 4 days but I am finding it difficult to cope with the mood swings. Seriously like every hour I want to punch holes in the wall and scream, then collapse in a sobbing heap. Exercise has been helping, but I have so many triggers! I want this addiction gone from my life! Have any of you experienced these extreme mood swings? How did you manage?

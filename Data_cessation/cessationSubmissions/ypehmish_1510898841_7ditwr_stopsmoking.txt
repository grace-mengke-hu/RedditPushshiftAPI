I got the flu almost 2 weeks ago, and haven't smoked since. I think this is finally it. No more cigs.

As the title states, I got the flu almost two weeks ago and havent had cig since. I should add that I smoked when I drank which was actually half the nights of the week. Its been this way for over 13 years. I'd like to say I feel better, but now I have what some refer to as "smoker's flu" and have been coughing almost non stop. I am sleeping A LOT. My appetite is all messed up. I understand this to go away over time, but I'm glad to say that this flu has been a Godsend. I've tried to quit a few times before, but I'm 31 and most of my friends who used to smoke don't anymore, and I'm typically the only one escaping the indoors/my friends to smoke one when we go out/get together. 

I suppose my only fear is when I go to drink again, that all those cravings will come back. I recognize I also have a drinking problem and so I am using this opportunity to also to take a break or possibly stop drinking for good. 

Sorry if that was bit rambling. I'm going to see how I fare with the holidays coming up, parties, etc. but I know I have two addictions and I'm confident that I'm saying goodbye to at least one. Cigarettes.

Now's the time

Hello everyone! I signed up to reddit just for this haha. I am a college student currently struggling in life. I'm finally ready to take the next step in life and make changes for the better. I had been smoking for almost a year. I started off with just one a week and eventually ended up at half a pack a day. I'm realizing that if I want to get back to that awesome version of me, I have to quit smoking. I have tried a couple of times before and failed. This time I have a feeling it will be different. I threw out all my lighters, cigarettes, and ashtray. Someone once said you never truly get rid of a habit, you just replace it with another and its up to you if the new habit is better. Well I just wanted to say hello, so I guess it's time to get back to studying and working out.

The easy part is done, how to deal with friends who smoke?

I've been lucky to be away from my friends and stopping smoking was a matter of resisting buying packs. But I'm going back to my home town soon and all of my friends are smokers. How do I deal with that ? I already know I'll have a hard time resisting smoking rooms at airports (major trigger!)

Will very small doses of nicotine in a vape help me stop?

I make e liquid myself (cheaper), which means i have complete control on how much nicotine my vape has, i’ve managed to go from 6 mg all the way down to 1.5, and i’m about to try 1. With this said, if i was to go down even lower than 1, would i eventually be able to phase it out?

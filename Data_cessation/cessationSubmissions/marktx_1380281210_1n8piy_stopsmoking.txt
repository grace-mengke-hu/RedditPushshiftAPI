A "first" happened today

I made it through nearly the whole day.. got home from work, fed my daughter, bathed her, put her to bed, was having a bit of quiet browsing reddit time while dinner was cooking in the oven... and then I suddenly realised I had gone nearly the entire day without thinking about wanting a cigarette or even thinking about cigarettes themselves. I'm not sure if I even thought about cigarettes yesterday.

I'm quite amazed, it's taken about 120 days, but not even having a passing thought about cigarettes for an entire day seems really weird.. but weird in a really really good way. It might not seem like a big deal, but it feels like a big deal to me.

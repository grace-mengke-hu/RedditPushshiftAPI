Those damn using thoughts

Dual addictions here. Started drinking heavily and smoking about 20 years ago. Ended up in rehab for alcohol 2 years ago and quit cold turkey for cigarettes three weeks ago. Early recovery is tough. The addicted brain really tries to mess things up as it seeks the drug it is missing. Images of using will pop up at the strangest times along with the thought that it wasn't that bad! Just as I had to do in early recovery from alcohol, and still do every day, I have to actively tell myself that my addiction is trying to mess with my thoughts. I have to stay away from that first smoke, and if I do, I will be fine.

Thanks for listening. Those cravings hit me this morning and I needed to share to get back in a good place.

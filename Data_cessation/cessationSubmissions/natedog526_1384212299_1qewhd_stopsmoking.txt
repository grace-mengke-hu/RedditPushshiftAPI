Day 2 is through

The second day was rather rough on me. Sitting at home and not smoking is one thing, I can do that all night long and not have an issue with it really. Being at work though is a bitch. Everyone around me smokes. What's worse is that one or two of them seem to think that I become real bitchy when I don't get my nicotine. That usually doesn't happen, at least not as badly as one would think anyways. In fact in my personal opinion I am [in control.](http://youtu.be/rQdiJoGoTxU?t=10s) I didn't go back to the gym like I planned though. I ended up sitting in my car talking myself out of running to the gas station and buying that pack to have 3 or 4 cigarettes before throwing it out. After about 15 minutes I talked myself out of it and went home. Probably is for the best that I don't hit the gym up right now anyways. I'm doing an awful lot right now to improve my over all well being and state of mind that I feel like I'm taking on a little to much. I'll give it a shot next week. For this week however I will focus on not picking up that next pack. Good luck to my other fellow /r/stopsmoking friends, and thanks for the support from my other posts, they have been very encouraging.

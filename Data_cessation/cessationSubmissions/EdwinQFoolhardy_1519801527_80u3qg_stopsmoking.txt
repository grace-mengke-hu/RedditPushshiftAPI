Taking Advantage of a Trip Back Home

I took up smoking November 2014, the month I got to my first unit in the Army. It started as a way for me to get to know my new co-workers better, then it became my occasional stress-relieving vice that I had to balance with my need for an acceptable run time. Then in January 2017 I suffered an injury that meant I would not need to ever run for a PT Test again.

Boom, my 3-6 cigarette a day habit became a 10-15 cigarette a day habit. 

Well, I ETSed last year, but I hadn't been able to really get a leg up on quitting. So, I decided that if I really wanted to do this the hard way, I could get just as stubborn as my habit.

I bought myself some nicotine patches and a train ticket and took a one month trip back home. I smoked my last cigarette on 15 FEB, and I'm not planning to ever go back.

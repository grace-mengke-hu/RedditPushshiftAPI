Quitting smoking with travel anxiety

I have panic disorder which makes commuting to work on trains really difficult for me. I quit smoking back in December 2016 for around 5 months using Allen Carr’s book and I found it really easy - everything in my life was improved... except it made my anxiety on trains worse!

I deal with my train panic attacks by chain smoking before I board - sometimes 3 in a row. Deep down I know it’s not the cigs that are helping me, but it’s more of a “if I don’t smoke before I get on I’ll have a huge panic attack and make a fool of myself in front of all these people with no escape”.

I’m quitting again tonight - I’m in the right head space for it but I’m just terrified that come Monday morning I’ll board that train and it’ll undo all the work I’ve done through CBT and therapy again! 

I can’t find anything on the internet about this or from someone in a similar situation. Has anyone experienced this?

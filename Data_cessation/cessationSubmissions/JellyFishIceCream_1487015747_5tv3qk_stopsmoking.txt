My valentine gift

Some 10 minutes ago i put out what will be last my cigarette, tomorrow i will gift myself a smoke free day as a valentine gift.

Today I already didnt smoke for most of the day, and even started working out again. But tomorrow will be my first smoke free days in i dont know how long, and im really looking forward to it!

PS this sub has been a great place to come and check out for me the last few weeks/months, cigarettes suck!

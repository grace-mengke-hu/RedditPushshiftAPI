"you don't want to be an old hag who can't breath like me"

Woman I've known for quite some time and who smoked for years and now has emphysema for quite some time. She commented on the picture I posted of Allen Carr's book (I was excited it came, okay?). Harsh language for the harsh reality of what will happen if we do not quit. [elephant in the room](http://i.imgur.com/WEQA0vx.jpg) 

So keep at it guys! :)

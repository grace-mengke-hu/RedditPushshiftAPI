How I got the shit, and smoking as well, scared out of me.

I'd been having trouble breathing and was feeling dizzy for last couple of days. Thought it prudent to have it checked out. Since I was sweating and was having trouble breathing, they gave me an Electro-Cardiogram. They detected some anomaly and recommended an Echo-cardiogram and Tread mill Test (TMT). TMT also showed some problem with my heart and they recommended an angiogram. By now, I was thoroughly scared. At 28, it seemed like my world could end any second. I called my brother-in-law, who's a doctor, who took next flight out to meet me. My girlfriend was beside herself worried. Many of my colleagues came to the ER for moral support. Finally got a CT Angiogram done instead of a Coronary one. After what seemed like forever, I got my results. No blockages. Dodged a bullet, but my will to smoke has gone away. Smoking is not worth it. I'd tried quitting many times in the past but finally I'm through. Fuck smoking. The only reason I've continued for so long is fear and apprehension whether I could quit. Now that I've had a glimpse of what I could lose, I'm no longer scared. 

Guys, quit before too late. I know /r/stopsmoking doesn't take too kindly to health reminders but, I hope you quit before it is too late. Wish me luck, too.

EDIT: Forgot to remove badge last time I tried quitting, so anyone seeing 407 days, it's invalid badge. Have sent a reset request.

Is there any risk to quitting cold turkey?

If I quit, I really don't want to use any aids (patches, gum, Chantix, etc). I have tapered down to a half cigarette every hour, so no more than 8 whole cigarettes per day, and I have been at this amount for maybe a year now. I know this isn't the same thing, but I have heard with alcohol that it is very dangerous to quit cold turkey. Are there any similar risks with quitting smoking cold turkey?

Edit: a couple of words.

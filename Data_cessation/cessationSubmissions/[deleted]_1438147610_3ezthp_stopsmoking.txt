Have the why to quit, but don't have the how

Feeling really hopeless lately about quitting smoking. I cannot take Chantix for medical reasons, Wellbutrin gives me itchies, and I can't seem to find vaping a logical alternative. I have tried cold turkey in the past and I'm a terrible candidate for it. I read Allen Carr's book and it didn't help me. I just don't know what to do anymore, so I smoke instead.

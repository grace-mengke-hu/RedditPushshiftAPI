It's been a week

As of right now I haven't smoked or "vaped" in 1 week. 

I feel less like shit, but I still want a smoke. The transition of going from "I fucking NEED one" to "I really want one right now" feels like a kid moving up to using pull up diapers. So I guess I still shit myself, but I'm a big kid now. 

I went largely cold turkey depending on how you look at it. I was using ecigs for about a month prior. Not with the intention of quitting, but with the goal of not inhaling smoke every couple of hours. I finished my last cartridge last Sunday around noon, and decided that I'd finally do what I've been wanting to do for a while now. And quitting is worse than I remember. 

I started smoking about 16 years ago. I have stopped twice along the way. The first time for about 2 years, and the second time for almost a year. Each time I quit was on a whim. I remember it sucking at first, but nothing too terrible. Usually made the decision because I was high and thought it sounded like a good idea. This time I wasn't high as I had stopped smoking pot accidentally almost 10 years ago. 

Each time I stopped smoking, I spent the first couple days higher than normal to make it easier. If it works, then go with it. I found that I had a pot store about a mile from my house(I live in Washington). I bought some, and spent my first 2 days stoned enough to make getting up to buy nicotine suck more than having nicotine fits. I haven't needed to sedate myself. 

I went into this with the idea of "not even 1". Every time I started up it was because I thought I could have just 1 and be fine. Which is a total lie. 1 turns into bumming a few. Bumming a few turns into buying singles. Buying singles turns into buying packs. Buy packs turns into "look at me, I'm a complete fucking idiot"

It is my Friday. I'm halfway buzzed. Last night I found a lost cigarette of unknown age at home. I really want to smoke it. I don't plan on it, but I really want to.

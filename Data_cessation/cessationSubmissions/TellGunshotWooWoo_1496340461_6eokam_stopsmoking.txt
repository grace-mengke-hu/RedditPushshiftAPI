Quit smokeless tobacco, didn't want to quit

I had used smokeless tobacco for the past 12 years and now that I've made it a couple of weeks without the crap I still miss it like crazy.  I quit solely to pass a nicotine test for a job but the thought in the back of my mind is I'm going to get a can right after I take that test.  

As bad as withdrawal was, as much money I'm saving, and repulsive tobacco is (especially smokeless), I still feel an overwhelming desire to pick up the habit.  I haven't bought any and don't have the test scheduled yet, I had hoped by this point in the process the desire to start back up would have subsided somewhat...

Any sage advice would be much appreciated.  I feel like an idiot for even considering it

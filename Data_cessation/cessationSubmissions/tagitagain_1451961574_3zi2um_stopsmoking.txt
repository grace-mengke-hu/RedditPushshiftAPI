Considering the savings

According to my stop-smoking app, I'll save over $1600 on cigarettes this year.  What do you do with the money you've saved? Do you put it in a special savings account for a big ticket item?  Sock it away weekly for a travel fund? Or give yourself a treat every month? Realizing I've spent that much on smoking is a huge motivator, and I feel like planning on doing something specific with it will help continue that motivation. So what are your ideas for the extra money?

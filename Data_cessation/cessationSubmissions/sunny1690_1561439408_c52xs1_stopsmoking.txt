Trying again after a year.

Guys, I've trued to quit before but ended up smoking again after maybe 20 days.


I want to try again now. But this time I've noticed that I'm extremely anxious. This hasn't happened before. Any advise?

The anixety is because I have 5 cigarettes left in my pack. But as I mentioned this hasn't happened before.

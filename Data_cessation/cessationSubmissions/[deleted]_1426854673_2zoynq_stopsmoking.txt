UPDATE: My biggest wake up call

So for all of you who read my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2xyydb/my_biggest_wake_up_call/) know that my sister is suffering from and advanced stage of cancer, which is untreatable due to its infection by the time it was diagnosed. 

I am here to give an update that things do not look well and from what her symptoms are, it does not look like she has much time.  She is currently in the hospital.  I am going over to see her now as I am unsure of how much more time I will have with my big sister.

If anyone still thinks smoking is cool or on the fence about quitting all I can say is go to a cancer ward of your local hospital and take a look around.  I would not wish this on my worst enemy.

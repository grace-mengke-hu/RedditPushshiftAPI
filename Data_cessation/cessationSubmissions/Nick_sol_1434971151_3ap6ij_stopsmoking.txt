Keeping motivated and willpower

150 hours smoke free, and feeling pretty good about it, but it is still early days. Have tried quitting several times in the past (in stretches that lasted 1-4months). This time I'm really determined not to have these relapses again, have a 4 month old son and last thing I wish is be a bad example to him as he grows up. What happened last few times trying to kick the habit was I seem to deplete my willpower and motivation over time! And I'm back to smoking again. 

curious to hear other folks experience with this,  and what you do to increase willpower or maintain a steady/strong motivation for the long term, when these are running low? 

Think this will be a very big challenge for me in the upcoming weeks. Cheers Nick_s

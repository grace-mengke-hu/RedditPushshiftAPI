Vent

I came here after work today to offer support and remind myself why I don't pick up again.  I read some posts that totally fucked me off. I guess the good mood couldn't last forever. 

I am trying not to judge other people. This is a new thing for me. I've been really calm this week, so this mood came out of the blue.

I was getting ready to blurt out everything that I was feeling and just not be very nice. Instead I took my own advice, I got up, put in my earbuds, grabbed my keys and started walking. I wasn't walking in any direction in particular and suddenly (this is the weird part) I started running. I haven't run in about 30 years. And I was wearing jeans. And the wrong shoes. Fuck it. It was going on 10pm and I was running away from the town centre. I probably only ran for about 5 minutes. Then I walked for another hour. I ended up walking through a dodgy part of town and made a big circle back home.

It's gone. The frustration is gone. I'm going to take my own advice more often.

Here's another cool thing. I've been trying to decide for a while if I would share it. I've had chronic pain for 24 years. For the past week, I keep forgetting to take painkillers. They aren't great anyway, because I won't take anything opiate based, but I never forget to take them. I forgot to take them tonight and then exercised. 

What is this whole new world?

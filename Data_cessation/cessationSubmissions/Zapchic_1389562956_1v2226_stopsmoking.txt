How does this sub feel about e-cigs?

I have a friend who quite smoking after spending 2 weeks transitioning to ecigs. He only vapes now and feels it's better for him. He saves money every month. The smell is better and he feels healthier. He also still gets to spend time with his smoker friends and take smoke breaks, but he isn't technically smoking. 

We had this discussion last night where someone was wanting to stop smoking and start vaping. It brought up many points. 

My question is to /r/stopsmoking. Is it better to vape than smoke. Is it an okay tool to use to help you quite?


**EDIT**: Wow! This has been way more controversial than I expected. Okay so here is my story and what I take from this. I am a pack a day smoker. I recently had to ask for my badge to be removed from this sub from failing the Allen Car method. 

My friends backstory... His company paid him a $2k bonus for attending a stop smoking clinic and successfully leaving cigarettes behind. This program was a 2 week program where he gradually dropped cigs and replaced the craving with an ecig. He has been smoking probably 30 years, 1-2 packs a day and is doing great with ecig. He hasn't had a real smoke since. 

Coming from my failure, I see this a huge success! I honestly can't see any drawbacks to this other than he is still spending money on a habit. A habit that he chooses and enjoys. We are social smokers and enjoy spending time together on the porch socializing, telling stories and enjoying a beer and smoke or what ever. 

* I also do not buy that having a habit is a terrible thing. We all have habits or could be called creatures of habit. ex: My parents do not have smoking habits but they do have debt/spending habits that are just as detrimental to their well being when compared to ecigs. 

* I have found no proof that ecigs are causing cancer. That being said, there has not been enough research. 

* Ecigs cost significantly less than traditional smokes. 

* Ecigs smell better. 

* ecigs from advice here could be used to help quite smoking - all the way to nicotine free vaping. This seems like a better alternative to patches/gum. 

* People also get hooked on gum/patches and return to smoking. 

For someone like me, after reading all of your comments, I think ecigs are going to be a way for to go. I need to drop the brand Marlboro. I can afford the ecigs and the ability to choose the amount of nicotine  and flavor is very exciting to me. 

Thank you for all of your feedback. It is much appreciated. I hope we can all keep an open mind and remember we all have goals and needs though they may not all be the same. 

However, we all do want away from cigarettes and ecigs may be a decent route for **some** of us.

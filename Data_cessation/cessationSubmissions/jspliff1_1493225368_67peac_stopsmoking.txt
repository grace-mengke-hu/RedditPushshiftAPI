Almost Fucked Up

Yesterday after work I asked a co-worker for a smoke and she said that she couldn't afford to give me one.

At first I was pissed I couldn't be miserable with her but now I'm very thankful for it. That small lapse would've been much more than just another smoke or resetting my counter. It ties in to everything else I do and everything else I would've given up if I had that smoke.

Day 2

3 years ago to the day, after quitting for a full year, I started again (like a dumbass!)  It was the day my nephew was born and my uncle and brother were smoking and so I thought that I would "just have a drag". That "drag" turned into a 1/2 a pack the very next day and I kept on smoking 10-12 a day.  3 years later and my wife and I are expecting our first child in about 3 weeks. I don't want to be a smoker anymore.  I really don't.  I don't want to pick up my kid and smell like smoke.  I don't want to have to not spend time with him, even if it's for 5 minutes, so I can have a fix.  I stopped smoking again on 7/25/14 at 4:00 P.M. and although the cravings are ridiculous and I am stressed out, I haven't given in.  I am done for good this time and I want to live for as long as possible to be there for my family.

How does smoking affect a singer's/vocalist's sound and performance? And does quitting really help it to improve?

Hello, it's my 28th birthday and finally I decided to stop smoking, wish me luck. After a couple of years, I decided to make music -and also sing- again (I play flute for more than 5 years and I have a one man project) So, I must say, I realized that I lost some abilities because of smoking, at least I think so. I would like to know if any other singers here can tell me about their before quitting/after quitting experiences with their singing/playing abilities. Thank you so much.

It’s been 4 1/2 months and I still get those massive cravings.

I think it’s because I limited myself.  When I was stressed out I would walk downstairs, go out on the porch, enjoy the silence and light one up. 

Those were my favorite and the hardest to quit. When I’m stressed out I still walk out on the porch, but I don’t smoke.  I just try to go through the motions like I did. 

But tonight I want one so bad.  But I don’t have any in the house and I won’t go out to get some. So one more day marked down.

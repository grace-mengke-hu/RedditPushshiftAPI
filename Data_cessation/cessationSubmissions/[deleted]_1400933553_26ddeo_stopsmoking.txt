Endurance

Looking back at these last 600 days I've realized how much better I am not only physically but also mentally. Yes I don't have short breath anymore nor ugly skin, bad smell and shaky hands but that's just a part of it. What really has improved is the mind. It doesn't need an external substance to be functional any more. Much more tolerance on stress and irritation. Overall there is no fear I have throat, mouth or lung cancer. Quitting smoking was the best decision I have ever made, along with quitting drinking.

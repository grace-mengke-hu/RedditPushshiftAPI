I used Smokefree app to quit smoking. The only thing that actually worked.

Tried nicotine Patches, gums, even Buproprion medication. Nothing worked permanently. I saw this app on iOS. It was a one time purchase. It gives great tips and rewards and motivates you as you reach a goal. It tells you it's okay if you have a craving and took a smoke and compares your progress to others who tried to quit(general comparison,not specific). It's great. Hope it helps someone. Doesn't hurt to try.

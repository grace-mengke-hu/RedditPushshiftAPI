After 216 days I caved due to stressful life events. Turns out, cigarettes are still pointless.

Seriously, if you're close to caving, ask yourself what it's going to do for you.  I think after breaking 200 days I learned a lot about what truly triggers my smoking and I'm not too worried about the pack I bought.

It's just... funny.  I'll restart my badge in the near future.

For what it's worth, trying to quit doesn't feel like a wasted endeavor.  Failing at this point isn't setting me back to square one (although my days will set back to day 1).  Keep attempting, eh?

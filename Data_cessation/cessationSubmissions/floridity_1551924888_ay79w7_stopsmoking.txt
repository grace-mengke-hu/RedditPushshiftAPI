first time quitting

hello all! i am going to be quitting smoking for the first time tomorrow. 

i’ve been smoking since 2013, and i smoke about a pack and a half a day, and i’m finally feeling the urge to kick the habit. i will be enlisting in the armed forces pretty soon, so it felt like a good time to quit. 

  if i purchase a juul to ease myself off of nicotine in addition to quitting cigarette smoking cold turkey, will it be wrong to count the days i use my juul as days gone without smoking? i know that it will still feed my nicotine addiction but it’s not exactly a cigarette, so i’m not sure where that leaves me.

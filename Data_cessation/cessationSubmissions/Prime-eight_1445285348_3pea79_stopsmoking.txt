Had a small setback 5 months in, but going strong.

Slipped up today and smoked half a cigarette. Its weird that the urge to smoke is so much stronger than the satisfaction I get when I actually smoke. Tossed the rest of the pack, and i dont know if I should reset my badge, but its getting easier to resist.

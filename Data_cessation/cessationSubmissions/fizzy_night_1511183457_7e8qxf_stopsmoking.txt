I️ woke up this morning and decided enough is enough

I’m 25. I’ve been smoking since I️ was 14. Ive gradually built up to smoking about 20-30 cigs a day and I’ve been there for about 2 years now.

Fast forward to this morning, I️ woke up at 3AM, hacking up a lung with this cough, sinus infection, and double ear infection that has hung around for about a month now despite antibiotics. Yesterday, I️ coughed so hard I️ strained a muscle in my rib cage. This morning it was worse. As I️ crawled back into bed after being hunched over my toilet hacking coughing and gagging up gray phlegm, I️ debated on taking another trip to my doctor for my torn rib muscle. I️ googled my symptoms just to look for home remedies. Lung cancer popped up first for a persistent cough and rib pain. While it said most scenarios are just exhaustion from cough and I️ probably don’t have cancer (at least not yet), this was the first time it felt real to me. I️ always made stupid excuses and assumptions coming from a family of smokers, “well dads 60 and doesn’t have any problems, great grandma died way past 80 and chain smoked, 80 or so is a good time for me to go.” and so on. I realized suddenly that all these excuses are shit. I️t feels like being hit with a brick. Like I️ totally get it now. I️ haven’t felt healthy in years. Only continuously feeling broke and miserable. I️ downloaded the smoke free app and that’s how I️ found this reddit. I️t looks like it will be really helpful.

Wish me luck guys. And congratulations to all who are continuing to better their health!

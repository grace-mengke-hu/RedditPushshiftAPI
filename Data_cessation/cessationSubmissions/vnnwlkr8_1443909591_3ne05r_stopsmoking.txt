Missing the cigarette for the first time

It is day six for me and until now it has been a relative breeze. I noticed the withdrawal issues in the first few days quite clearly,  but besides that, I'm doing pretty good actually.

I also had a lot of moments where I just had the habit of grabbing a cigarette. Not having them and not wanting them, that was very strange. Just so automatically looking for the tobacco and then I remember, oh yeah, I quit, haha.

But this evening is the first time I really miss tobacco. If (and I highly doubt it) I would ever pick up pipe tobacco or the ocassional cigar, this would be the moment. It is Saturday evening, I'm tired but not so tired that I want to go to sleep. I would love to just sit for an hour, relax and smoke.

I believe getting used to the new normal of not being a smoker (of anything, cigarettes / cigars but also weed, 5 weeks clean) is the main thing that I need to work on in the following weeks. I've quit before. But you get used to being a smoker again so fast again.

I just wanted to write this down. Venting a bit I suppose. I have no intent to buy cigarettes at all :). 

Because besides this moment, I feel very happy and content. With life in general (for the first time in I don't know how long) and with quitting smoking!

Update.

So I know some of you were around when my husband and I were going through the job situation.. and just wanted to update.

He just got a salary job, and he'll be paid weekly. He started today. I'm so proud of him. We celebrated tonight with Mexican food. Me for re-commiting my quit, and him for everything he is.

I wish I could send some of you tacos! You all are doing so well!

Also:: what's your favorite quit help? I'm a sucker(ha) for anise candies and spearmint Trident.

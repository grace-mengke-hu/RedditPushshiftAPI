In exactly a week from now I'll be posting about how I DID NOT smoke in the past week!!!

I've been a smoker for the better part 25 years, I'm also a serial quitter. My husband works out of town- one week away and one week home. On the week that he's away I find it pretty easy to quit, sure the kids stress me out and I get cravings, but all in all it's not too bad.

The problem is when my husband is home. He smokes about a pack a day and they're always around and I find it next to impossible to resist the urge.  So I'm stuck in this ridiculous, annoying cycle of smoking like crazy the week he's home and hating myself and feeling like crap- then going through the hell of quitting all over again every time he leaves.  This has been going on for literally years if you can believe it!  It's so engrained in me that I can actually feel my cravings getting worse the day he comes home like clockwork.

Right now I'm on day 10 (he worked a few days of overtime last shift), and I'm sick and #%&amp;@ing tired of the same routine and I want to change it.  I'm done with having to start this damn quit over every other week.  He comes home tonight and leaves next Thursday afternoon, at which time I'll be posting about how I DIDN'T smoke all week. Not even one.

Going Out, Smoke Free

So I'm 9 days into quitting and went out with friends last night, most of them smokers. I was really nervous that I'd cave and have a cigarette but I didn't. Thankfully, everyone was really supportive of me quitting as I hadn't even told them until now. Here's to another 9 days. And another and another and many more!

After months of telling myself every cigarette would be my last. I QUIT.

I'm 21. I've smoked since I was 13 years old. I'm a 10 a day smoker and I've quit before for short periods of time (a couple of months at best). 

Recently I got into a mental rut where I'd tell myself every cigarette would be my last - yet I'd be running to the shop for a pack (one more pack will be ok...right?) like a demon was taking over me and telling me that I needed it.

I've realized that I'm done. I'm at work and I just went out the back for my last cigarette. I wrote a little monologue (is that what it's called?) to post here. I thought I'd share it with you all.


 

>As I spark up this cigarette. I stand here out the back on my own.
>
>I'm not getting any enjoyment out of this. I am smoking to fulfill a void. Temporarily.
>
>This smoke doesn't taste very good at all. It doesn't smell very nice either.
>
>It's making my throat dry. I try to push out of my head all the negative thoughts about what smoking is doing to me as I inhale.
>
>I'm not talking to any one. I'm outside. On my own. A five minute break from work. Does it really make a difference? I could be doing something else.
>
>I'm almost at the end now. The smoke billowing out from the butt. I flick the ash onto the floor. Someone will have to clear that up. 
>
>I feel the warmth on my fingers as I walk over to the ash tray. Taking one more puff. Inhaling the poison into my lungs as I flick the butt into the tray. That'll be my last one.

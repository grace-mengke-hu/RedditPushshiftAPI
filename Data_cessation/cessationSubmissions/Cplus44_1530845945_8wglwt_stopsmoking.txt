Scared to quit because of withdrawal...

I'm honestly scared shitless to quit because I don't know how bad it will be. My fear isn't "what if I don't enjoy social occasions anymore?" It's "what if I'm out in a mall or somewhere else and I don't have a cigarette and I can't handle the withdrawals and I pass out?" I've been smoking for ten years and have attempted to stop twice before and each time I would be laying on the couch feeling like crap and it was only for 15 hours! Then I would run to the corner store, buy cigarettes and start chain smoking until it went away. 

How bad is withdrawal after day one? Is it possible to pass out from withdrawal? Am I completely blowing this out of proportion and it's not as bad as I think?

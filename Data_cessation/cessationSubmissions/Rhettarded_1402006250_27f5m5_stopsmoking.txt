Too sick to keep doing this to myself.

A little background about me...  24 year old male Australian. Started smoking when I was 15. I've never greatly enjoyed it I guess, it felt more like a bad habit than an addiction. Tried to quit at the start of the year. Lasted two days. So I am fully aware now that this is an addiction and I will be able to kick it. 

I've had a mild flu for about a week now. The cough that goes with it is killing me.  It's like my lungs can sense the ship is going down and are trying to eject. 

My chest hurts.  My head hurts. 

I have more important things to worry about than smoking.  I have so many reasons to quit and no reason to keep smoking. 

Game on!  Day 1.

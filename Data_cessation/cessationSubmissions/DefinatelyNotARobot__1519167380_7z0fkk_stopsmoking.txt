I smoked after 12 days.

I was doing fairly well, didn't really want a cigi, then a few too many drinks after work put the nicotine back in my system, and well I bought a pack this morning.

Not the end, but I'm gonna stop again after this pack. Hopefully make myself feel shit, then remember why Im stopping in the first place.

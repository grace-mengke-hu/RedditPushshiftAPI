I'm about to go and smoke my last cigarette...

I've just finished reading Allen Carr's book about quitting smoking and am going to go and have my last cigarette now that I've finished the book, as the author suggests. I'm 21 years old and have smoked for the past 3 years but feel like I finally have the confidence to stop once and for all. I'm excited!

This subreddit seems like a great place to share stories and support one another, so here I am. I'm looking forward to do as well as some of you. I'd say wish me luck, but I know I don't need it!

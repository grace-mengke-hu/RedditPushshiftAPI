What can I do.

I'm on day six and have a biology, and orgo chem test in the morning that im likely going to fail because of this withdrawal process. I tried as hard as I could to study the past few days but to focus on anything for more than a minute is physically impossible. I feel as though my brain is wrapped in a fog and there's no escape. I can't think. I can't maintain a conversation. I can't walk into a room without forgetting why I was in there in the first place. I feel absolutely miserable and hopeless....BUT, there is one thing I can do better in spite of all this bullshit. I can breathe, and I can breathe like never before. That is enough to keep my from grabbing that stupid fucking pack of marbs. Heres a big FUCK YOU cigarettes, ill get my brain back eventually. In the meantime ill try to enjoy being a potato.

18 days in... and so is she!

I picked Christmas day to be the quit date. I didn't want the bullshit excuse of letting another resolution get blown. We had a week before New Years Day was over so my partner and love is also doing this with me. I am so proud of her and the strength she is putting out to stay away from picking it back up. I can say the cravings have subsided. Now it's getting better everyday. Especially with her. Once again to those who slip, I was the guy who was gonna die smoking. I just put them down and quit, they aren't gonna win this time. Total time 18d:10h:13m:48sec without nicotine.

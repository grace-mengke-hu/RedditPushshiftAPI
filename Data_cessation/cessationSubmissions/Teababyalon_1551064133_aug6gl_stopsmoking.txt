Crying phase

So I didn't really want to quit but my doctor prescribed me BuPropion ( however you spell it ) for depression and now Everytime i try to smoke i feel like shit . The only thing is that I am going through all the withdrawal pain (crying, headache, grumpiness) but if I try to smoke I get extremely nauseous. I could stop the medication but I kinda do want to quit. I dunno. Sorry that I sound panicky I'm just in the crying phase and I feel like shit and I'm tired of failing .

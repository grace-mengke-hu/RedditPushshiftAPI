3rd times the charm! Trying Zonnic to quit this time!

Today is the first day I'm trying to go without a cigarette like the post said I am trying Zonnic. The other two previous attempts were cold turkey (lasted all of 2 days) The other one was with Chantix lasted a month a half. So any tips and advice would be appreciated. 

Sorry about grammar or spelling didn't really attend school.

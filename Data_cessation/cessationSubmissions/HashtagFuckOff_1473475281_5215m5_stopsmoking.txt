I don't smoke

I have been an on and off smoker the last 6 years. Some quits were easier than others, lasted longer than others, and felt better than others. After probably a steady month and a half of smoking and thinking about quitting, I finally figured it out. I just simply don't smoke. I'm not cutting back, I'm not going to think about strategies, I'm not quitting. I just don't smoke, I used to smoke and now I don't. I could try to quit, I could set goals, or I cold go turkey but I don't need to. So here is to throwing my pack away and going into the transition from being a smoker to not being one. I usually hate the idea of rephrasing things to make them more powerful (i.e. Don't say diet say lifestyle change), but this feels good. This is a transition, not an attempt to change something. If I try to quit smoking, I'm a smoker who is depriving him self of smoking to try to not be a smoker. If I am not a smoker, I'm not losing anything. Maybe this is dumb, but it's going to work for me so I thought I would share.

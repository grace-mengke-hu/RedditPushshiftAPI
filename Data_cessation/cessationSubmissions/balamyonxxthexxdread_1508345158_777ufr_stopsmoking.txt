Help Hype me up!

Tomorrow is my quit date, and while I do want to quit and I do have a loooong list of personal reasons why I'm quitting, any words of encouragement to help Hype me up would be fantastic! Anyone else ever feel anxious right before thier quit date? 
What were your reasons for quitting? How did you/what helped you to succeed? What did you do during times of intense craves? 
Edit: ive used the Allen carr book for so many failed quits it doesn't really work on me anymore....ðŸ˜•

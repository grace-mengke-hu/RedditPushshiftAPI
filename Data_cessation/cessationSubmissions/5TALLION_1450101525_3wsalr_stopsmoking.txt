So nearly quitting, losing motivation.

I've been cutting down on cigarettes for the past six months or so and now I'm down to maybe 3 a day at maximum. I feel so much healthier and saving a lot of money, but at times where I've quit for 1-2 weeks I don't feel any healthier or different aside from the fact that I constantly crave one. 

Has anyone else cut down like this and found it especially hard to cut out the last few? When I cut from 10 to 5 a day the cravings subsided after a few days rather quickly, but with this it stays fairly consistent. Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this final hurdle?

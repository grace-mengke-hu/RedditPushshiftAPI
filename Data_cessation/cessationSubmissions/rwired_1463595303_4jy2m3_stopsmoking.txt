A Story of Extreme Tapering

I haven’t smoked a cigarette in over 2 years or taken nicotine in over 6 months, but today I requested a day 1 badge, and here’s why… (TL;DR at the end)

I was a heavy smoker, 50 a day minimum. I knew I had to quit, and I had tried many methods… cold turkey, patches, gum, hypnotherapy, EasyWay. All had failed me, or I had failed them. Do we fail to quit because we are failures or because the methods we choose fail us?

The way I see it, all quit methods fall into one of three main camps:

1. Willpower methods. The idea that by denying yourself something you really want for long enough you will eventually stop wanting it.
2. Mind control methods. The idea that you can change what you really want into something you really don’t want by reprogramming your conscious and/or subconscious.
3. Substitution methods. The idea that you can replace the thing that you really want with something else that isn’t as bad for you that might be easier to give up.
	
In the case of smoking, the addiction is to nicotine, which as everyone here knows is quite possibly the most addictive substance regularly consumed; more addictive than heroin, cocaine, alcohol or caffeine. With smoking however there is also a habitual component to the addiction. The act of lighting up and puffing away is itself addicting, especially when precipitated by triggers such as a meal, a coffee, a phone call or a walk.

Many of you will have no doubt tried many methods to quit before, and for whatever reason ended up right back where you started. That happened to me over and over. At first, when I was younger, like most people, I believed I was a strong person, in control of myself, and that if I really wanted to quit, I just would. And so many times I tried by willpower alone to ‘just stop’. 

The problem with willpower methods, as so eloquently pointed out by Allen Carr, is that even the strongest will in the world eventually has a breaking point. If you still believe that smoking was in any way good for you, that it had even the tiniest upside – e.g. that it relaxes you, or goes well with a drink, or helps you fit in with the crowd, or relieves your anxiety – then eventually you would snap back into your old habit.

After many failed willpower attempts I realized that my will had little power, certainly not enough for this formidable task. Around the year 2006 I read Allen Carr’s EasyWay, and this immediately led to 6 weeks without smoking. Carr does a good job of pointing out that the problem is in the brainwashing that society has bestowed upon smoking (especially marketers and the media). Anxiety is a symptom of being a nicotine addict. Yes the nicotine relieves the anxiety, but once the nicotine wears off greater anxiety comes back. The real way to quit is to ‘undo’ all the brainwashing, to really know the truth deep-down, in your subconscious. Consciously be mindful of how nasty the cigarettes really taste and smell and how much damage they are doing to your lungs and heart, to your teeth and skin and breath. Know that there isn’t even a tiny upside to it. Only then will you truly not want to smoke anymore and you can put down the pack and never be tempted by it again.

Only it didn’t work for me.

Eventually I would face some crisis at home or at work, or a big night out, or some other kind of trigger, and I would have ‘just one’ to help me through it. Quickly the dam would burst and all the reverse-brainwashing would be reverse-reverse-brainwashed. This nicotine monster would always find a way.

I tried hypnotherapy too. I paid a psychiatrist a premium rate for their quit-smoking program (apparently by making these things more expensive ensures that you are more ‘vested’ in it). Interestingly, I asked the psychiatrist why he couldn’t hypnotically implant the idea that cigarettes taste like poo. He said that he could, but that it’s actually very dangerous to do things like that. The danger is that in order to maintain my nicotine addiction I might end up seeking out poo tasting things. Yikes!

The hypnotherapy got me about 3 days smoke free.

The real problem is that I just wasn’t drinking the Kool-Aid. I wasn’t taking deep down into my psyche the notion that there wasn’t any good part to being a smoker, even with the help of hypnosis. 

I think the real problem with EasyWay and other similar methods is that if you have even the tiniest bit of doubt or disbelief, then they are nothing more than willpower in disguise. Allen Carr’s nicotine monster needs only a sliver of a handhold and he’ll hang-on patiently waiting for your time of greatest weakness. If you really can truly slay the beast once and for all, and with all your heart and mind know for sure, to the very depths of your soul that you HATE BEING A SMOKER, then this method can work.

But it didn’t work for me.

I decided to take a different approach, one that I will call “Extreme Tapering”. The idea was that I would reduce my dependency upon nicotine so slowly that neither my conscious mind, nor my subconscious would be aware anything was changing at all. 

I had tried tapering before, going from 10mg to 8mg to 2mg Tar, from Mild to Light to Super-Light flavors. Every time I would do this, I would find myself instinctively smoking more frequently, and in deeper breaths. I would be spending more money on cigarettes and making my lungs feel worse. Sometimes I would go the other way and buy the stronger versions, reasoning that if it had more nicotine, I wouldn’t need to smoke so much, and therefore I’d do less damage to my lungs and save money. Inevitably I would get used to the stronger flavor and build up more tolerance.

Sometimes I would try tapering by denying myself cigs at certain times of day, or above a certain quantity in a day, e.g. permitting myself to only buy 1 pack per day no-matter-what. In my opinion this was just the willpower method but worse. Denying yourself something you really want, but allowing yourself just enough of it that you’ll never be over your addiction to it is JUST MAD. Do yourself a favor please!

Extreme tapering would be different. These are the basic tenets of the method:

1. Don’t deny yourself anything. You want it, you have it. No pain or suffering.
2. There shall be no willpower involved.
3. You don’t need to control your mind to change the way you feel about smoking (love it or hate it).
4. The thing you are addicted to will be reduced, but so slowly, and by external agents, in such a way that in your day-to-day activities you don’t notice anything changes at all.
5. Eventually the only things remaining are the habitual compulsions, not the substance addiction. From this point onward it’s just a matter of time before your bad habit will die of its own accord. No need to force it, just carry on as you are.
	
The only real requirement is that you have engaged your higher faculties to decide to stop smoking. Completely rationally you decide that smoking is bad for you, whether it be for health, your family, for society, or your wallet, or all the above. No need to try to convince yourself that you actually hate this thing you keep doing to yourself, or to try to scare yourself with pictures of cancer ridden lungs or exploded hearts. No funny games. Enjoy the feelings you get from smoking if you want but you know that stopping is the right thing to do, so you will start this journey. You decide to quit, but based on past experiences you know that you are weak-willed, easily triggered, and hard to reverse-brainwash. So forget all those methods, this method will work. This method will be even easier than EasyWay! 

In this method, nothing is left to chance. You have made a rational decision in your neomammalian complex (thinking brain) but later inevitable moments of irrationality won’t break your decision. Your reptilian complex (lizard brain) and paleomammalian complex (monkey brain) are going to run amok of your best laid plans as they always do, but with this method, unlike willpower or mind control methods, it doesn’t matter.

It just takes time.

So what did I do exactly?

.

**Step 1. Switch to e-cigs**

Why? Because with e-cigs you get to control the nicotine level yourself, to a fine degree, and right down to 0mg.

And, unlike other nicotine replacement therapies, e-cigs closely follow the almost exact same habitual actions of smoking real cigarettes. You put it in your mouth, you draw it into your lungs, you feel a ‘hit’, and you exhale a satisfying cloud.

In addition you get a vast number of non-smoker benefits right out of the gate, including:

* It’s almost certainly far better for your health than breathing tar and tobacco which is on fire.
* It doesn’t make your clothes stink
* It doesn’t make your breath stink
* It doesn’t stain your fingers or teeth
* It’s much much cheaper

For many this may be the hardest step of all. I’ve read many comments on here, and know many friends who have tried and failed to make the jump to e-cigs. For some reason the failure rate seems to be quite high. 

I think it’s because people expect the change to be easy, and they give up too soon. Maybe they try to jump to e-cigs and simultaneously try to cut-back on the nicotine.

Some people seem to be irrationally “in love” with smoking, and are unwilling to find “new love” in vaping. Especially since the new mistress is quite exotic, while the devil-you-know has all that you need.

For me, it took a good 3 months before I’d transitioned from burning cigarettes to electronic cigarettes. At first I knew it would be hard to change my lifelong smoking habit, so I allowed myself to smoke actual cigarettes anytime I wanted to. But at all times I had my vape-pen right there, and would try to use that as much as possible. I started trying e-cigs on Feb 10, 2014.

I actually chose the strongest e-juice I could get at the time - 18mg, and so I was getting VERY BUZZED when I used the vape, much more than my regular cigarettes. 

Inevitably the nicotine monster inside of me loved this new source of food, and so dutifully lobbied the lizard brain to request behavioral changes to the higher brains.

My close friends who were interested in switching to e-cigs tried my e-juice but couldn’t handle the extra strength. I feel sad that they didn’t really understand what I was trying to achieve, and instead dismissed e-cigs as “not for me”. Most of them as still regular smokers today.

The transition to e-cigs is VERY IMPORTANT, and you have to persist and do whatever it takes to make it happen.

Early on after I’d been vaping exclusively for a few weeks, I made the mistake of running out of e-juice. I naively thought that maybe I’d be able to ‘just quit’, since it had been weeks since I’d smoked an actual cigarette. I couldn’t even last a day! I was climbing up the walls. I was going insane. I ended up buying a pack of my old brand, and chain smoking them. After they were done, I went out and bought 2 packs. Needless to say, I got myself some more of that 18mg e-juice as quick as I could get it delivered, and never made the mistake or running out again.

So at this point was MORE addicted to nicotine than I was before, but I was OFF cigarettes. This was beginning of May, 2014.

.

**Step 2. Start mixing in lower nicotine levels, SLOWLY**

So at this time I’ve got a brand new habit to replace the old one. Instead of checking I’ve got a pack and a lighter in my pocket every time I leave the house, I now have to check I’ve got the vape-pen, a spare battery and a bottle of e-juice. Unlike cigarettes and lighters which can be picked up at every street corner, e-cigs require a bit more foresight and planning, especially if you are going to be out for the whole day. On this journey the worst thing to happen would be to run out of power or juice while on-the-road, that would inevitably lead to a relapse to burning sticks.

But it was easy enough to do. Each 6 weeks I would order 5 more bottles of juice, and whatever new accoutrements were needed – new vape-pens, atomizers etc. The cost came to about 1/3rd what I used to spend on regular cigarettes over the same period.

 I tried different flavors, moving away from the various tobacco flavored juices I’d first gotten used to, and learning to love apple, and vanilla, and coffee. I finally settled on a mix of Vanilla and French Tobaco as ‘my flavor’, two bottles which I mixed together to my own preference.

I should be honest here. At this time I figured smoking e-cigs would now be my lifelong vice. Already the benefits over the burning sticks were self evident. My sense of smell had greatly improved, and along with it food started to taste so much better. My breathing had improved, and I was able to run up flights of stairs like I was in back in my 20s. I felt like a better person, and I looked like a better person, and I was still getting a fix whenever I wanted. I could lean back in my office chair and puff away not worrying about smoking indoors, being called out because of the smell, or creating a fire hazard. People would actually compliment me on the “nice smell” if they came into my office (it was the vanilla juice).

But I was aware that the extra strong e-juice I was buying was making me pretty high and quite light headed most of the time.

So I started buying 12mg bottles to mix with the 18mg ones.

Some months later, I was using all 12mg, and I started to buy some 9mg to mix in.

Some months later, I was all 9mg, and I started on 6mg.

Then 0mg mixed with 6mg. Just a bit at first, but gradually more and more. For many months I settled on 3mg (50/50 mix of 6mg and 0mg different flavors).

I started smoking pure 0mg e-juice on Sep 28, 2015 – 1 year, 7 months, 2 weeks and 4 days after I’d started smoking 18mg e-juice.

I relapsed and added nicotine to the mix again a few more times up to Oct 28, 2015, but that is allowed in this extreme tapering method. I believe it’s important to not force yourself to go without something you want.

Since then I have not inhaled or ingested nicotine in any form intentionally.

I should note here, that once your e-cig habit has formed, you ‘reach for the bottle’ to refill your cartridge the same way that you would reach for a lighter in your old habit. It’s just the thing you do to satisfy your urge.

By choosing to buy essentially the same bottles to replenish the ones you’ve used, but with the odd lower strength one to mix in, then your conscious mind is aware of it at the time of your purchase. By the time you are seeking out your fix, issues of the strength of the mix are not really weighing on your mind. You just want your fix. As with traditional tapering methods, there is a tendency to puff more often and inhale deeper to get the same nicotine dose you are used to, but because the difference between one month and the next is so little the effect is very small, and disappears as you fall back to your normal daily rhythm and cycle.

.

**Step 3. Just keep smoking 0mg like you were a regular smoker**

So this is the bit that surprised me the most. I was now nicotine free. But when I tried to go without my e-cig, I would get irritated and antsy.

I thought by this point I would be able to just put it away, and be done with it, but instead what I discovered is that I was still very much addicted to the habitual nature of smoking. I was still a smoker!

So I just kept smoking. 

I kept ordering refills, all 0mg. Switching my flavors until it settled to just colorless vanilla flavored 0mg e-juice.

Every time I would feel the urge to smoke (which was pretty much continuously), I would reach for the vape-pen. The urges would subside.

And I kept doing this for 6 months.

In the last month or two friends had commented how I didn’t seem to be using my e-cig so much these days. It was in my pocket, I just wasn’t taking it out so much.

I noticed myself, that I would be engaged in some activity at work, and would go for hours and completely forget to reach for the e-cig. 

Yesterday, May 17, 2016, I accidentally forgot to put it in my pocket when I left for work.

I didn’t notice until the day was half over. I’d gone to reach for it to find it wasn’t there. I didn’t have a feeling of panic. I didn’t feel like I should rush home to pick it up, or rummage through desk drawers looking for an old one that might still work. I MOST CERTAINLY did not feel the need to visit a convenience store to buy a pack of cancer sticks!

I felt like it didn’t matter. 

I don’t need this anymore. I don’t smoke.

I got home, and noticed the e-cig on my bedside cabinet. I didn’t reach for it. This morning I didn’t reach for it. Before going to work I put it away and out of sight. 

So, as of today, I proudly join the ranks of non-smokers everywhere. I don’t feel even slightest urge to ever smoke again.

I picked up my day 1 badge, and I wrote this just in case it helps anyone else.

No Willpower. No Mind Control. No Brainwashing. No Stress. No Anxiety. No Anger. No Fear.

Just Time.

----
TL;DR

Took over 2 years to quit painlessly.

Spent 3 months transitioning to e-cig, then 18 months very slowly reducing the strength of the e-juice from 18mg to 0mg and another 6 months only smoking 0mg until one day I ‘just forgot’ to smoke. 

I was too weak-willed and self-indulgent to do it any other way.

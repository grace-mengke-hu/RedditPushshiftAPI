Day 6 and I'm sick?

I am on day 6 of my journey and I have a pretty killer sore throat and I'm a little bit stuffy. I was coughing a lot yesterday and the sore throat started to come on later in the day. Has this happened to any of you? I'm just trying to figure out whether this is my body detoxing or I actually have a cold.

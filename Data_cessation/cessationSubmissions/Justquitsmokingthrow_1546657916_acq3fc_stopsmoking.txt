Recently quit smoking but I have a question

I smoked for 2 years and averaged about a pack a week during that time. I quit on New Years. It was my resolution. My question is what kind of damaged could I possibly be looking at down the road? Do you think I smoked enough to cause any major side effects like cancer etc.? I’m pretty OCD, so I always kind of have worrisome thoughts like these. Any input would be appreciated because I’m not really knowledgeable about the effects of cigarettes and how much is too much. Thanks.

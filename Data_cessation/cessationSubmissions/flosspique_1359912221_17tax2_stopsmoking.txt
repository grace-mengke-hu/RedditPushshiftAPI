Last night I failed

I've been going pretty strong for a little over a week but last night I was wandering through an alley and I found half a pack of my favorite brand. I lit one up reflexively, not even thinking and it felt so good and I knew in that moment I was going to finish off that pack and buy another and another. I knew I have no control. And then(sorry to pull a creative writing 101 cliche) I woke up and realized it was all a dream. I took a significantly deeper breath than I have for the passed 6 years and felt so free and proud and genu iley happy to not be a smoker. It feels so much better than that first morning cigarette, I swear to god. Stay strong guys and I couldn't have quit without this forum and all the info it provides. Thank you.

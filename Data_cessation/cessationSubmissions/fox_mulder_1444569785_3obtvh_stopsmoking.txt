"Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times." - Mark Twain

It's only been 8 days, but I'm confident this will be the last of the "thousands of times". I've been putting this poison into my body for over 45 years. I've been slowly ruining my health while contributing to the wealth of big tobacco companies, and I've finally decided that enough is enough.

I'm done with cigarettes, and fuck the companies that have been poisoning us for far too long. Fuck the companies who used the cartoons I watched as a child to sell me on the idea that cigarettes were good. Fuck the companies that used my childhood belief in Santa Claus to prime me to be a smoker.

I'm done with cigarettes, and I'm done with the corporations who put their profit above our health. I'm just ashamed it took me so long to do this.

I'd like to be done with this for good.

I've been a social smoker for about 10 years.  I've tried to quit a few times.  Even had a 2.5 years under my belt at one point, but that was when I didn't go out for a few weeks.  I'm going to do that again and put myself under house arrest for a few weekends.  Maybe it's time to get addicted to a new videogame or something.  Thanks for letting me vent.

Asked for a badge reset, and I'm ready to do this for real.

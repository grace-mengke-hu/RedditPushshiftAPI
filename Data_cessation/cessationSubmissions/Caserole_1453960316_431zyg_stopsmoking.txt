My car broke down while I was between two jobs and it was the best thing that happened to me.

My car succumbed to death. I was left stranded at my apartment, trying to figure out how to get to work with ridesharing. All I did was mope around, eat everything, and lay around in bed. I'm a very busy bee usually so this was weird for me.


After a few days, I noticed I hadn't smoke at all. You'd think I would be, right? Well, I decided to keep to it and now I'm entering my second week milestone.


Things I'm experiencing or experienced.

*super irritability. I've been fighting with my boyfriend a LOT. We live together and he quit with me, too.

*headaches (this stopped after 5 days)

*a feeling of emptiness, like a desire to feel that dirty feeling I get from smoking.

*dizziness and word jumbling. Almost like I was perpetually tipsy (stopped after a week)

*nausea (stopped after first week)

*restlessness


I noticed that I've replaced my smoking addiction with a drinking water addiction. I'm aware of water poisoning so I'll try not to go overboard. But I've been hydrating a lot more and use my water bottle to help cravings. I will drink from it or chew the nozzle (not good but hey its not a cigarette).


I never got past the 2 week mark. Currently, I'm feeling a little queazy. The side effects come and go. I'm using an app to keep me in line. Just wanted to post in hopes someone like me will feel inspired.


The silly thing that's keeping me preoccupied is this karaoke app I have on my phone. Since I'm still indoors, I spend it singing on this app. I'm noticing already that my voice is becoming more clear, confident, and better overall. How cool is it that I can listen back to when I first quit and compare it to my future beautiful voice??!!

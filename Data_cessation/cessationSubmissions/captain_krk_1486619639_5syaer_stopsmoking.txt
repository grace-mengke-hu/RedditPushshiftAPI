Quit 13 Days Ago, Not Happy

My husband decided to quit smoking, and then said, "we should quit smoking." He got on Wellbutrin right away and nicotine patches. I didn't start Wellbutrin for a full week after, and was only on it for a few days. Basically, I am really struggling. I didn't even smoke that much before, like 2-3 smokes a day. I just feel like I wasn't in the right mindset to quit and feel like it was sprung on me, but I don't want to let my husb down. We have had a brief conversation about how I am feeling, and he said I don't have to quit if I'm not ready... But, now that I know how disgusting of a habit he thinks smoking is, and how he hates the smell, I don't want to become unattractive to him. I really don't know what to do, but the cravings are killing me.

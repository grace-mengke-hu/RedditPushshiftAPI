My first post/Ending day 4

Want to get some things off of my chest (pun intended). I am 23(will be 24 in a week, hope I won't smoke in my birthday party). 
Anyhow, I had smoked 2.5 years half a pack a day, and quit on Sunday evening. I started running every morning since Monday. I think it helps though I can't tell how much exactly. I have been eating like crazy. Today was better than last few days. I took 3 nicotine gums on my second day and 1 gum yesterday during the times I was about to lose it, but took none today. I think it's going well but still long way to go. I have some more triggers I need to adjust to. I also give myself some kind of reward every evening, like going to movies, restaurant, live music show (from a fund I created, amount of money I would spend on cigarettes for the next month).
Sometimes it gets depressing, and I am pretty much quitting alone, so my brain tells me you don't matter to anything or anyone anyways, why not just keep smoking? But I want to achieve this for myself, so I can tell in the future that I did it. It's also a great learning experience in life, in terms of discipline and long-term goal orienting instead of short-term fixation. Like, if you achieved this you can achieve many things. Hope you are all doing well :)  Cheers!

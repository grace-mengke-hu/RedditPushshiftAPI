Stopped taking Nicorette 3 days ago. Having some serious mood problems...

I've been smoke free for over a month, but only nicotine free for a couple of days. I started off with the 4mg Nicorette mini lozenges for two weeks, tapered down to the 2mg strength, and completely stopped taking them on Tuesday. 

I'm struggling with mood changes to the point that it's affecting my performance at work and interpersonal relationships. The anxiety and depression make me just want to give up on everything and go back to bed. Even the most simple of tasks feels impossibly difficult. 

How do you get through this stage? I'm no longer a smoker and don't feel tempted to have a cigarette, but I want to be done with nicotine altogether!

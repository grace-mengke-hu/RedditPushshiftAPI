Resetting my badge!!

My badge says 322 days, but in all honestly, it is more like 295-300 days. For nearly the past month or so I have been *smoking like a chimney*.

UGH.

It started off with 1 cigarette. After that, I felt disgusting. I went a week after that incident before I *'really wanted'* one. Then I smoked another, ended up buying a pack, then two, then another, and now I have destroyed all of my remaining cigarettes. Tonight is the night I make attempt #2. I am super upset that I made it so far and gave up for literally *no purpose at all* except a lack of self control.


Alright, StopSmoking, this time it will happen. I hope to again join the triple digit ranks and then the quadruple ranks eventually followed by the *'basically forever/non smoker'* ranks.

Enjoy your evening. :)

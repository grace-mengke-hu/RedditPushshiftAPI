One Month In: Reflections and Thanks

I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but now I've broken free from the addiction, I realise the irrationality of my actions. I mean, smoking is 100% disgusting. The smell, the taste, the ill affects such as that vomit-inducing sound of crackling mucus when you cough, and yet when you're a smoker all of this is secondary to having that 'relaxing' cigarette.

 The person who used to cry when she had no money for cigarettes, get angry when she went too long without them, be surprised when she didn't have to buy a second packet in a day is long gone. It's like she was never there at all. 

It has made me think about just how intensely *powerful* nicotine addiction can be. People always say 'just stop' (I used to tell myself I could stop at any time with about 20+ failed attempts previously), but it's not that easy, not at all. I think smoking has been so widely commercialised and normalised that people overlook the withdrawal that can come with stopping and that it's a genuine addiction. I am free from these chains now, and I will never be a prisoner to addiction ever again.

A million thank yous to you, the amazing community here at /r/stopsmoking, you guys are without a doubt my main source of determination and motivation. 

Best of luck and stay strong everyone. :)

Caved

Hey Reddit,

I have never used this app before and decided to make an account because I am truly out of options. A few days ago, I caved and bought a pack of cigarettes because I was having a fight with my my girlfriend. Tonight, I was out with friends and continued to smoke. I feel terrible because I let many people down. One, my girlfriend who I recently got back together with after a long break up due to substance abuse on my part. Two, my mom and dad that I feel like I disappointed. Last, my friends who wanted to quit. In addition, I have made a new friend that has started to pick up smoking after hanging around me the past few days. He even bought a pack and I feel like shit.

I have no idea where to go from here. Should I tell my girlfriend? What should I do about my friend?

I made a mistake but it was a blessing in disguise.

I went out to the bar last night, and I didn't smoke almost the whole night. All my friends were in and out of the bar smoking in the rain and I was inside. It was all good up until my friend basically ditched me and since I had a few in me I got really mad. I waited 20 minutes and chewed 2 straws to hell during a craving and it still didn't help. I convinced my roommate to give me a few drags of his (like 3) and he did, but I realized, **I didn't like it**. So while I feel stupid guilty, I also realized how gross smoking is to me now and have a whole new resolve to not smoke anymore.

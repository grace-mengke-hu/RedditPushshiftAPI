18 days smoke free... taking it day by day.. no biggie


I’m 18 days into my smoke free life. I feel incredible. I can breath! My lungs don’t hurt anymore. I’m not stuffed up like before. My energy levels have shot over the roof. I wake up early without feeling groggy. My skin looks vibrant - my face is glowing. My teeth are visibly brighter, the yellow tint is completely gone. My fingers don’t smell like cigarettes. I don’t smell like cigarettes: not my hair, not my clothes, not my breath. The feeling of freedom is in all these small things you start noticing, every day. 

I was a smoker for 17 years. Never a social smoker.. always a committed one. For the past 2 years, I’ve attempted to break free from the nicotine 6 solid times. Once I quit for 32 days. All of them cold turkey (I had taken Champix 7 years ago but couldn’t handle the nightmares). Every time I quit, I feel incredible. The greatest version of myself. And I never forgot that incredible feeling when I relapsed. There’s no question that your life is turned completely upside down when you quit. I am trying and succeeding. I know this time is it. I don’t miss the cigarette at all. 

18 days smoke free and taking it day by day.. no biggie, just a small battle  (when you think how complicated our actual lives are). 

Oh and did I mention that my hair and nails are looking gorgeous lately?

Anyone else with these symptoms and know how to get it under control?

On Day 12! And it’s been super hard. I feel like I don’t sleep anymore. Since I’ve quit I wake up at 4 and can’t get back to sleep until around 7 and then I’m in and out until I have to get up. Anyone else with trouble sleeping??
Also I’m super irratable and pissed off all the time at absolutely nothing, and my anxiety has me bursting into tears at any moment. Anyone else feeling like this???
For anyone else who’s struggling here’s some thing that I have found that help!
I’ve been using the app Smoke Free to help and it works. I am using FREE patches from leavethepackbehind.org if anyone needs some - Nicoderm didn’t work for me (rashes all over my arms) These patches by Habitrol work and I got 8 weeks supply for free :)

22 Days. When will I like it?

22 Days today. Longest I've had since I was 14 without inhaling some sort of nicotine. I was on the patch, and I forgot to put it on last Monday, and I was fine. So I just went with it. Still no patch since then. A few monster cravings but not enough to give in, even when my fianc√© accidentally left his WHOLE pack home..... I threw them in a drawer and kept myself busy. 
But I'm just waiting for that 'I FEEL SO GREAT' moment. My breathing hasn't changed- that I noticed, my energy levels are the same, my taste is the same, my skin has been actually breaking out like crazy, and I honestly thought I would be saving more money. The only big change I noticed was my sense of smell is a little better. I'm just finding it hard to stay quit because not much has changed. I understand in the long run CANCER is obviously the main reason to quit. But I'm having a hard time keeping that in my focus. I miss cigarettes horribly. I just want to know WHEN will I actually like staying quit? I really don't know why I have been sticking it out this long. I think it's because I'm in a competition with myself or something. Like 'don't be a weak bitch and smoke, you're fine' And I make it through it. I have this weird love for the act of smoking I guess. I do think it's sexy, I don't mind the smell that much. If I smell a cigarette it isn't gross to me, I'll literally stop and romanticize and take a deep breath of that shit air.  Like a junkie obsessed with the needle. I'm a fuckin weirdo.

30 days

Well. I've made it 30 days. It has been hard since most people at work smoke, but I've done it. I don't get winded going up stairs any more. 

I'm going to start running again. 

anyway -

I smoked for 15 years. 10 of those were 20-30 cigarettes a day. 

I quit smoking July 21st, 2013

Which makes me 30 days without cigarettes. 

I have not smoked 759 cigarettes. 

I have saved 303 dollars. 

It is pretty crazy seeing the actual number of how many cigarettes I used to smoke in a month. (a pack to a pack and a half a day, so I just rounded it out and said 25 a day). 759 is a lot of cigarettes. 

I have also noticed the extra monies in my bank, which is nice. 

I can't remember of the last time I had a craving for a cigarette. 

I'm pretty excited. 

High fives all around.

I quit smoking with 14mg nicotine patches. Day 1.

I started smoking at the age of 22 and have been smoking a pack a day for 4 years straight ever since. Until yesterday. 

I tried quitting once (cold turkey). It worked for 2 months, however I started smoking again as I was overeating and craving sweets like a maniac, which led to being overweight fast (gaining 6 kg in 2 months is not a very pleasant thing to experience).

A few months ago I tried again, after precisely 23 hours I HAD to have a cigarette or else I would be convinced I'm gonna lose my mind.

Today at 9:30 AM I started using Nicotinell, 24h 14mg nicotine patch. Even if I smoke a pack a day, the pharmacist insisted I start with 14mg instead of 21mg. Good choice so far.

Usually the first day is the worst after quitting. However, this patch is ridiculously good. No cravings, no mood swings, no side effects, no burning throat sensation. Been hanging out with my friend over a beer an hour ago (now it's 7:10 PM), she was smoking and I did not feel any impulse to want a cigarette myself.

Has anyone ever experienced this? Maybe tomorrow it will change and it might get tricky, but at this very moment I am actually amazed about this patch.

Hopefully everything will go smoothly and withing a few good weeks I will no longer need these patches.
One patch at a time. Haha. Haaa.. (my puns are terrible, I apologize). 

Can anyone tell me their experience with Nicotine patches? How it went, did it work out for you, how was it in the beginning? For how long did you take it? 
You know, all of the good stuff. I'm all eyes. :)

Cheers,
Alina

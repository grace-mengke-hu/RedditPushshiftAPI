Stupid Smoking Dreams!

I am SO CLOSE to being quit for a year (March 25). 

Last night, however, I had a dream that I smoked. It was so real! I felt every inhale-- it was my delicious Camel Menthols, back with me again, like a long lost old friend. I had 2 of them, looked around to make sure no one saw, threw the butts in the trash, and kept telling myself "it was only 2, your year free still counts". I felt so....satisfied, and disappointed, and embarassed all at the same time. SO CLOSE TO A YEAR! How could you do that? It was so worth it! Never again, until next time, but your year still counts!

Then I woke up. In a cold sweat, panicking because I thought I had smoked one. My husband looked at me like I was crazy, and I just mumbled something about cigarettes and turned over and went back to sleep.

I'm just curious why, after all this time, am I having a smoking dream. Last one I had was 2 months into being quit. It's like my subconscious  knows it's almost a year, and it's trying to trick me. 

Anyway, here's to no more crazy ass smoking dreams. And here's to 19 days until I have been smoke free for 1 year!

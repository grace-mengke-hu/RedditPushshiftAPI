Last Friday was my last cigarette

Hey everyone! One week ago I smoked my last cigarette! I have been using a vape, but most of the time I have it in another room and I totally forget about it anyways.  I use it the most in the car while driving, because honestly that was my favorite time to smoke.  I’m feeling really positive about this experience so far. Everyday I still want a cig, but even that has gotten better! I’m spending more time with my fiancé and not worrying about the next time I’ll go outside to have a cig. Love kissing him goodnight without him making a face because I smell like smoke. A little worried about going to a party tomorrow since I’ll be drinking. Luckily, it’s my best friend will be there and she just quit as well. Good luck to everyone, it’s a filthy hard habit to quit!

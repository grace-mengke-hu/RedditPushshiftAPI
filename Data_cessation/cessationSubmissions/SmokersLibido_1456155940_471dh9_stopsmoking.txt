My Libido is GONE after quitting smoking

I'm 34, smoking for 10 years.  

At my height, I went through a pack every 2-3 days.

I stopped 1 week ago, cold turkey, and noticed **my sex drive is shot.**

I'm terrified, this doesn't seem worth it.  

Has anyone else experienced this?  How long did it last?

I'm reading that it can take months... MONTHS... to normalize, if ever at all.

I can't even muster up an erection to masturbate, and if I do, it doesn't last long-- it's fucking terrifying.  

I get my normal morning wood, but beyond that, I don't have control to do it on command.

Someone tell me this gets better.  

**EDIT** I don't need to be told smoking is bad.  I get it.  I am asking: 
(a) has anyone experienced this? 
(b) how long did it last?
(c) how long have you been a smoker, and to what extent?

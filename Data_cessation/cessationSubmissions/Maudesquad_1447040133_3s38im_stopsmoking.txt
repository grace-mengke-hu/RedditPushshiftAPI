How to help my mom quit?

My mom has been smoking for over 40 years. She has tried to quit a few times and was successful for two months. My aunt passed away from lung cancer last week (smoker for over 40 yrs). I was thinking of getting my mom something to help her quit (hypnosis session, whatever). I did get her Alan Karr's book (think that's the name) before, she misplaced it (she is also a borderline hoarder). She has expressed interest in quitting in the past but wants the patch or something as she believes she can't quit cold turkey. She said she couldn't afford it. Anything I can do to help?

Take a look at my clean-up routine. Do you really want to do this? I want to stop

1. Tie up hair in bun
2. Have hoodie available just in case it makes clothes smell
3. If no gloves were used, use Purell and softsoap (when I get home) to clean hands. 
4. After Purell, use dry shampo on areas of smelly hair and clothes. Chew a combo of altoids, spearmint orbit, and drink iced coffee.
5. Use the citrus disinfectant spray to clean up drivers seat after leaving car
6. Put hoodie in washer and take shower using herbal essences on every part of my body
7. Use facewash excessively on face and hands
8. Use that gum purifying toothpaste and cough up black shit after finished
9. Go back to car with a fresh nose and clean up any remaining smell with disinfectant

That’s my daily routine, and part of the reason why I’m trying to stop.

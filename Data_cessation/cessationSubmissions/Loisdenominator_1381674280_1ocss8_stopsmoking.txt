Question for you running ex-smokers: runners' high, have you experienced this?

With so many of us quitters taking up running to help with quitting and/or just because we can, have any of you achieved the fabled runners' high? Does it happen for everyone? 

Also, a little late in the season, but for Canadians there is the [Run to Quit Program](http://www.runningroom.com/hm/inside.php?id=4913) I just found out launched this year. 

One of the stats mentioned is that when combined with running, quitting has a 25 % success rate, much higher that the typical ~ 5%.

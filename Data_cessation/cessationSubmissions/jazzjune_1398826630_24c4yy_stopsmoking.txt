Cigarette charades!

Weird trick I do that helps.  I kind of just "figured it out" but apparently it's a well known one.... oh well!

My cravings are way down and I feel great,  but for those moments when I want one: I will go outside, reach in my pocket, pull out a box shaped piece of air and open the top, fish around for an invisible lighter.... etc... I'll "mime smoke" in complete gory detail.

It's pretty weird, but it helps.   I'm not sure if it's just the soothing ritual or the deep breathing, but it makes me not smoke so hey.

One week today

It has been just about exactly one week since I smoked my last cigarette and became a non smoker. It is good to be on the road to freedom after years of being afraid of even thinking about the journey. Have not traveled very far yet and it has not always been easy but at least I am moving forward!! Thanks to everyone who has wished me well, It is going to be a long trip but I am glad to have such good companions.

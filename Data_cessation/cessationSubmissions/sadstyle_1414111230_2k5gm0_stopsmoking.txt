I thought I screwed it all up

I had another very vivid smoking dream. I was feeling very low and ended up chain-smoking 20 cigarettes. While doing so I kept repeating to myself "why did you do this? You just threw 10 weeks away and now have to start all over." Immediately after I tried to "purge" all the smoke and everything else I inhaled and seeing all those cigarette butts made me realise what a huge fuck up this was.

I woke up totally convinced this actually happened and went to what used to be my favourite place for smoking to see if I actually bought some last night. Phew I didn't! I was SO relieved. The dream actually echoed a lot of events that are happening in real life atm (bar the smoking craving) so I am glad these actions were just imaginary. 

Here's to heading towards a 3-digit number soon. :)

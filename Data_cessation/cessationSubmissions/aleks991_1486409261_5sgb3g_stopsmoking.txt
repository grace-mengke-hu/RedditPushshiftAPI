Quit smoking a few days ago but need to study

It's been about a week and a half since I quit, everything has been fine as it could be, my girlfriend has been supportive, and so on.. but I started stuying yesterday and found out I couldn't concentrate, there is like 0 percent chance..It's an Algebra exam and when I try to practice, it just pisses me of and I have the urge to just throw my notebook and book and everything...
Does anyone have any advice? Cause I really need to pass that exam and at the same time I don't want to go back to smoking.

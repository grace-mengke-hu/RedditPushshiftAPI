Found this in another sub, but thought it would be useful here too. 10 questions to ask yourself before lighting up.

Before acting on a trigger or temptation discipline yourself to review the 10 Commandment Questions of Relapse Prevention. Commit them to memory and let them be a guiding force in your life.

* Will acting on this temptation bring me long-term satisfaction or instant gratification?

* What will be the end result if I act on this temptation?

* If I choose to act on this temptation will it make my life better or worse?

* Do I take 100% responsibility for my own actions or do I blame others and make excuses?

* Can the addicted part of my brain force me to act out against my will?

* Is there a part of me that wants to walk away from this?

* Can I choose to follow that part that wants to walk away?

* Is there a feeling of peace that will come to me if I walk away?

* Would I feel better about myself tomorrow if I didnâ€™t act out today?

* Will I honor the rational part of my brain that is encouraging me to walk away from this temptation?

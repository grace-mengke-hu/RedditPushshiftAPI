Oh the places you'll go.

It's been over a year since my last cigarette. I am so different now. My life is different. When I clean I don't stop 42 times to smoke. When I got in a car my seat belt goes on, I don't clamor for my lighter and pack to be secure in my lap first. We all know how it goes. Yesterday I ran my first marathon. I'm almost 36. I smoked for about 17 years. They lady next to me at the starting line had the same story. It all began with putting the pack down. I read Allen Carrs book. I then understood the great lie that cigarettes actually do something for you. They don't I hope everyone trying to quit understands that. Cigarettes do not relax you. As a smoker you are spending your life in a constant state of withdrawal. It doesn't have to be that way. It sounds clich√© but if I can do it you can do it. Sincerely, an ex-pack and a half a day smoker.

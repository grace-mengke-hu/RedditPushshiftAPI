Please help, I can't stop smoking every 20 minutes

I've smoked several years but over the last month, it became harder and harder to wait in between smokes. It's a struggle to even wait over 30 minutes to smoke and it's like I just don't care for the past month. Any tips to go back to how I used to be (every hour/hour and a half) before I begin a quit plan?

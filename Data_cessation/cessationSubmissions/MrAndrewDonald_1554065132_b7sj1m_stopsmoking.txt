7 and a half days. Finally ran

Last time i quit, i leaned heavy into running to make sure i didn't fall back down, i finally started again.


It was just a mile, and it wasn't a half respectable time, but I did it. I'm still coughing my lungs up, and it feels like a terrible punishment, but it's a step.

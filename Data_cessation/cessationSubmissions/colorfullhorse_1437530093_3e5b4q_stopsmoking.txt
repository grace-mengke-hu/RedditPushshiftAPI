Tobacco & nicotine free cigarettes

Did any of you ever tried them, the herbal cigarettes used in movies ? i havent been smoking for 3 weeks now, but im affraid i might go back to smoking if something really stressfull happends in my life and i wanted to at least have an alternative if i ever need one.
have any of you breave people tried it as a substitute or just from curiosity ? is it worth it ? smoking is a long journey for most people and i dont want to go back to smoking ever again, but i know myself well enough that i might turn to cigarettes when i feel stressed out of my mind.

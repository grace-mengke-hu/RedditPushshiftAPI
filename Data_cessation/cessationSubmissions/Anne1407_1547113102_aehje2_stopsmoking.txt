01/10/19 how are you doing today?

So, how are you doing today? I've quit for 7.5 days now. I have not smoked a cigarette for 7 days, 12 hours, and 37 minutes.  
I am sick with the flu now, and waiting for a call from my boss. But how are you doing? How are the triggers, how is the not smoking treating you? What are the benefits you notice?  
Let's not smoke today :)

Just finished 24hrs without smoking

Wow!! I just went a day without smoking. It was tough but im determined to not smoke again.
I feel a little guilty coz im smoking weed and it feels like I have not given up completely but what the hell. Im going to give up cigarettes for now and think about weed later. 
Congrats to everybody who has quit. You guys are an inspiration.

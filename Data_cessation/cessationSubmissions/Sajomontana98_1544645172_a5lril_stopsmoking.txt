155 Hours stopped

At the beginning it wasn't that easy. But now i realise that every minute of smoking cigarrets was just wasted time.. 


Example. ..
1 cigarett = 5min
100 cigaretts = 500min (6hours20min)

now its time to create an own business with the lost time, DO IT LIKE ME GUYS STOP WASTING TIME IN YOUR LIFE WITH THINGS WHICH WONT BRING YOU FORWARD. NOT ONLY CIGARETTS, EVERY NEGATIVE "DRUG".

GOD BLESS YA ALL

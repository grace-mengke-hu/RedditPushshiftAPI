Just starting? Take it one day at a time... until it isn't ... ðŸ˜‰

Just stopped by to check my flair on a whim and saw that I am closing in on a year. It flies bye, guys. Stick with it. Take it one day at a time, and eventually you will forget, as I did, and realize you are much further along than you thought.. 

Follow the golden rule. Not one puff. Do anything else, just don't smoke. Awaken everyday prouder of yourself than you were yesterday. Be proud of yourself.

I need some advice...

I've decided that today I want to quit smoking cigarettes. For a number of reasons 

My nieces and nephew

My health

The people around me

My wallet

So I've had about 5 drags today down from smoking about 4-5 cigarettes a day since I was 14 (19 now) 
The problem is that I'm out of work right now and I find myself just sitting around craving a cigarette. 

Does anyone know any great ways to beat the craving? Things to do/chew/drink?

Does water pipe cause relapse?

Hello everyone, I live in Turkey and water pipe (or shisha/narghile) is a big part of our culture. It is a must when you go out with your friends but I've decided to quit smoking cigs yesterday and I wonder if smoking water pipes might cause me to go back to smoking. cigarettes. Many of my friends and I smoke shisha once every two weeks and they don't seem to be addicted nor do they smoke cigarettes. But I can't really be sure of myself.

Misery.

So I've been quit for six weeks ish now. Don't regret it and I'm super proud of myself. I don't miss cigarettes at all and I'd never ever want to start smoking. There's just one thing though, I'm miserable as shit. 

I'm not miserable in a way where I'm missing cigarettes, I just don't feel like me. I know that sometimes it's normal to be a bit down when you give up smoking but seriously I don't even want to get out of bed in the mornings. My job is suffering and so is my life in general. 

Anyone else experienced this? Does it last forever? I really don't want to be like this.

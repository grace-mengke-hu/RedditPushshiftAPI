question regarding nicotine replacement and antidepressant dosage changes

I purchased both the gum and the lozenges, and both inserts state that if you're on anti depressants you need to discuss with your doctor as your medication dosage may need to be changed. Last time I quit using NRT there was no mention of changing dosage on antidepressants. Why the change? Does the doctor suggest an increase or decrease in AD meds? My quit date is coming up quickly and my next doc appt isn't for a while so how important is it, really, to coordinate with your doc on your meds?

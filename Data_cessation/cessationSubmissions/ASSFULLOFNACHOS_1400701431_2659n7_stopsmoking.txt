Casual smoker for 7 years. No motivation to quit..

Hi all,
I've been an on and off smoker for quite a few years, over the past year or so I've stuck to just smoking a couple of rollies on the weekend, usually after a surf or a couple when drinking. 
I'm not sure how bad 5 rollies a week is for me. I'm quite fit and exercise most days, and wondering what effects this small amount of smoking has on me?
I go through cycles of not smoking at all for a few weeks then having a few on a weekend but still feel worried about cancer. I'm wondering if I should make myself give up for good, or just enjoy a small pleasure on the odd occasion..
Cheers

What to expect?

Hi, guys. I'm getting ready to quit and I was wondering what the expected feelings I'll get, apart from the obvious cravings. 
It would be great to have some preparation on what will happen. 
Would you share your experiences? 

I'm trying to get the "this is a disgusting habit every way you look at it" mindset. 

Thanks!! 

Edit: Update.
After one of the worst hangovers I've had in years, I didn't smoke all day yesterday. This morning I woke up with the feeling that I could use this opportunity to try to quit. 24 hours without smoking without even trying has to be used in my favor.
It's almost noon now and I fear the "after lunch" smoke. My plan is breathing the deepest I can everytime I want to smoke. As I see how bad my lungs are, the need to smoke diminishes considerably.

Stressful day, all day long standing up, people died, didn't craved

So, I work in the Civil Defense of my city, basically we take care of disasters in prevention and in response to them.

Today was a really stressful day. Part of a hill colapsed on some workers in the morning, 3 workers got stucked under the rocks and mud. 2 of them died, one is alive so far. It was the first day i had to deal with this kind of situation after i stopped this time, and being only 7 days i was really afraid i would relapse.

But no, i went all day long with just water, doing my job. I thought about smoking but didn't had any serious craving. I'm really happy for it, although I'm really sad about the situation. It was a really bad day, stressful day, but a stressful day without cigarettes...

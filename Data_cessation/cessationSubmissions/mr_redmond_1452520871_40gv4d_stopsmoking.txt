Are e-cigs safe?

Hey,

Firstly, I do not want to use an e-cig to stop smoking. I'm happy with my NRT and it's really helping. I'll be off this NRT in a week or so once I get used to not having a cigarette in my hand.

But, I was discussing with my partner about her quitting smoking. And she was saying she would quit, but she wants to use an e-cig.

My argument against this is:

1. It costs the same amount of money as smoking.
2. Nobody knows whats in these liquids and whether or not they are actually safe or not.

I suggested she come to the doctors with me and get some NRT treatments, but she's always got an excuse for why she doesn't want to use NRT, even though she successfully quit with NRT in the past.

It's this silly fad people are going through at the moment. All these shops popping up all over the place and she just wants in on the trend.

But I'm trying to find information for her to convince her that they are not safe, or at least untested.

In my opinion an ecig isn't really quitting smoking. It's replacing one dangerous thing with another and the cost in savings is nothing. Infact it's more hassle to try and get these liquids than it is to walk to a shop and buy a packet of smokes (at least in our area).

If one is dependent on an ecig surely this can't be kicking the addiction? If one thinks what they are doing is perfectly safe then they will continue to do it without worrying about stopping right?

My brother didn't even smoke, and he went out and purchased the biggest ecig he could fine. He buys copious amounts of liquid. When he puffs on this thing the amount of smoke is ridiculous. He will smoke out a small room with one puff and he will do this all day.

I'd like to find some information on how safe these are in respect to quitting smoking.

I look forward to feedback.

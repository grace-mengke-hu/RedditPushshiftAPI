Can’t quit but I have to

Smoker for almost ten years now, read all the books, downloaded all the apps, but nothing seems to work, I just genuinely really love smoking.  It’s my biggest crutch and my favorite pastime and I just can’t seem to shake the routine I’ve had for the last decade.  I’ve always wanted to quit, but was never really serious about it until this last month where I’ve tried to quit pretty much every single day and have always caved in by the evening.  My longest streak of not smoking was a day and a half but I started having too much anxiety so I just kept smoking and continue to feel like a total failure.   Having sinus surgery Thursday and was advised to stop smoking two days beforehand so I’m gonna give it a real go tomorrow simply because I have to.  Absolutely terrified and anxious about what’s to come.  Just wanted to get my thoughts out there, thanks for listening.

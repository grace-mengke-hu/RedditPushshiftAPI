Exercising Again

I used to run a mile in a half in about 9:30.  Not bad.  After I started smoking I stopped running, gained weight, and when I did exercise my stamina was awful.  If I ran pretty much at all I'd end up coughing and feeling horrible after.  Well I just started working out again and man it's so much different.  Was able to do a 2 mile interval run and feel fantastic.  No coughing or anything.  Just wanted to share, feels good !

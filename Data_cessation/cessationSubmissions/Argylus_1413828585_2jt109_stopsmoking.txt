First week down with HUGE unexpected opportunities to fail. Screw that!

Going to do a little bragging here; so I knew I was going to put my resolve to the test this weekend. I had a nice dinner out for a friend's 30th birthday at an Italian restaurant. I knew there'd be wine, good food, and several people in the group who smoke so setting up the mental state before was pretty important.  Got through dinner, dessert and coffee with a few notable cravings but otherwise fine.

Outside the restaraunt, it's decided that now we're going to go to a bar. Crap. Hadn't counted on that. Not to mention one of the smokers in the group offers me a cigarette as she knew I'd smoked before but not that I'd quit. 

"NO! Er... I mean no thank you". That one was a struggle.

Long and short, we then went to a bar, had a few drinks, then went back to another person's home until 3 AM, all the while booze flowing and cigarettes burning. Just about bit one of my fingers off at the knuckle but I didn't cave. I'm certain that this quit is going to be 'The' quit. 

Power to all the other ex-smokers on here.

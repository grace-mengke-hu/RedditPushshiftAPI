1000 hour mark.

It's about 45 minutes early but I've got shit to do so I figured I'd post this now.

1000 hours.

840 (or so) cigarettes not smoked

$292 dollars not spent 

Over 100 hrs not wasted standing in the heat inhaling deadly toxins.

This doesn't even touch the best parts, the hours not spent worrying about when I'd get my next smoke.  The not worrying about my son getting nicotine from skin transference or from holding my gross, smoke laden hair, not having smoky breath when I give him kisses!

Some days are still challenging, my latest mind trick is this one "Hey, big strong guy, you're so awesome!  You've gone 40 days without a smoke, in fact, you don't even want one.  That means you're cured!  Since you don't want one it would totally be okay, in fact, a good idea to smoke one, just so you can see how much you don't even want it!  Because... nicotine"

Even at 42 days I have to trick my mind back into alignment.  Currently I'm negotiating with my brain, I tell it "that's a good idea, I'll think about taking you up on it tomorrow, but for today I'm still not going to smoke.  See you tomorrow!"

P.S for those of you that are hour counters, 1000 hrs is 8 hrs before your 42 day mark.

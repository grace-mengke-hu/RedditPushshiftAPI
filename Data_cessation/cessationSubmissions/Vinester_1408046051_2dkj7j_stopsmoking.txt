I'm 16 years old, and smoking pressure is high.

Hi, I'm posting on here, although I wouldn't class myself as a smoker, because I'm worried I may become one. I'm 16, English, and would be what's known as a casual, "social smoker". I thought that this would be a good place to post this, as I needed a group of people who would understand smoking pressures, yet still be against it. Ever since I was 14 I have been invited to parties in which people would get drunk and smoke like chimneys. In order to keep my "credibility" I have always felt the need to join in, as all the action would happen where the smokers are. I don't really like smoking. I mean it's awful, and dangerous. Yet, this attitude has led me into cigars and eventually "bunning man zoot" (smoking weed) as rejecting it would make me a "pussy"/"batty boy"/"chi chi man". I will always go to parties with the attitude of not smoking, yet always end up doing it anyway, although I will usually manage to avoid going to a "bunning sesh" (a gathering in which the sole intention is to smoke weed). The thing is, I'm getting worried, as the more and more I smoke at these parties, the more worried I am about developing a serious habit. My main questions of this post are; 1: can smoking a few cigarettes every month or so really develop into a habit/damage my health drastically? 2: Did any of your habits develop from this attitude? And 3: As people who have most probably made the wrong choice in these scenarios, what could I do in these situations that isn't "get better friends" or "don't go to those parties"?
PS, sorry if this is inappropriate for this subreddit, I just saw a link posted to it that made me think and I had to get it off my chest. Thank you.

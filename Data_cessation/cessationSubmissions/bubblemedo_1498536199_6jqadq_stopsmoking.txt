Quitting tomorrow!

I'm 29 and I've been smoking since I was 16. God, I wish I knew then what I know now! Said every adult ever. ;)

I'm just over it. I have two amazing little boys who deserve a better example of a healthy lifestyle. I want to start working out more and take care of myself so I can grow old and watch them grow up. My 8-year-old told me a few days ago how sad he is that I smoke and how he worries about my health. Ugh. So yeah. I also want to save money and not feel like my day is controlled by cigarettes. I want white teeth and fingertips not stained by nicotine.

I smoke a pack - sometimes more - per day. I'm worried about triggers because at this point EVERYTHING is a trigger. I smoke when I first wake up, with my morning coffee, on my way to work, on breaks at work, after meals, when I'm bored, when I'm busy and stressed out, as soon as the kids go to bed, before *I* go to bed... etc, etc, etc.

Anyway, I have one cigarette left in a pack. I'm about to smoke it right now and I hope to never buy another. Wish me luck! And if someone wants to tell me it gets easier, I'll listen.

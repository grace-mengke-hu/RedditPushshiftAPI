So angry!!! I just need to vent!

So I’ve been smoke free for 38 days! My boyfriend keeps saying he’s going to quit which yay for him but he buys a pack smokes a few throws them away, puts on a patch, gets cranky after a few hours goes and buys another pack. Repeat, repeat, repeat! So today he gets this genius idea to go give me his cigarettes to “monitor” how many he’s smoking!!!!!!!! I was pissed! Seriously yes I’m doing good but I smoked for 23 years and you’re just going to throw that temptation at me! Then a couple of hours later I walked in the kitchen and he walked right in the door with a cigarette!!!! We have NEVER smoked in our house! I’m upset that I don’t have any support at home and expressed that and now it’s turned into a fight. I’m also still dealing with the fear of the unknown nodules in my lungs on top of all of this. I feel like I’ve been kicked in the gut! End rant, thanks for listening!

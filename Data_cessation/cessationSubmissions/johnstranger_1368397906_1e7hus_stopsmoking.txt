Stopped smoking 2 months ago, Struggling with sleep. Any tips?

So I stopped smoking just before the Easter holyday, but I have struggled falling asleep ever since. 
Mentally I'm completely done, I do not crave it or anything, I just get really restless each evening. 

Anyone noticed the same?/Any tips?

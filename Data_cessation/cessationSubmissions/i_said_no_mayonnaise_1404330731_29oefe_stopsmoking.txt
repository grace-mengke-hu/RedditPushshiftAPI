I've been a smoker for 15 years. This is day #1 without a cigarette.

I was on my way to a friends wedding with my boyfriend. I pulled down the mirror to check my lipstick and noticed my yellow teeth.  I was so grossed out I almost started to cry.  I'm only 28 and get winded from walking up the stairs.  No more, I'm ready to take my life back and stop being a slave to my addiction.

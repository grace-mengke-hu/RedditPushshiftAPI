Allen Carr's book

Just finished Allen Carr's book to stop smoking. I don't smoke cigarettes though (anymore), I vape. 6 years with cigs, sbout 7 years vaping. Tomorrow will be my first fay without vaping. I feel confident. It's been wayy too long that I've been ingesting bad stuff  Anyone else read this or another book to help quit vaping?

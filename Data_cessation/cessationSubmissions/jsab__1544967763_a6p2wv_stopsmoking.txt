The first morning

Hi everyone,
For me the morning has always been the worse moment where I crave nicotine.
Or in general when I am still half asleep.
And you know, routine with coffee etc.

 I want to quit vape.
And I vape almost while sleeping (exxagerating now).
What can I do when I wake up and go crazy?
Take a shower?
Make a smoothie?
Drink drink water till dying?

Cannot go for a run even if I would love to because other health problems / chronic pain.

I am trying to come up with a plan.
Any idea is welcome

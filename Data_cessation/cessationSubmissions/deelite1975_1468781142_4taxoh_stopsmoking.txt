Sneaky cravings?

Having cravings today after not having many, if any, in days. Yesterday after seeing a movie and after being in the mall for 2 hours, I thought about a cigarette at the end of each activity but it wasn't even a craving, it was more of a habitual thought where a physical craving would have been. It was weird but not bad or hard. 
Last night, I had a dream that I was smoking... It wasn't what the dream was about but I was doing it within the dream and when I woke, my hand was held as if it had a cigarette in it. That kind of bothered me. Exactly how addictive and mind altering was this habit I had!!? And I didn't even realize it.

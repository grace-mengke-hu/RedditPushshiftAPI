Damnit, need to reset my 3 day badge and start again

Gave in to 2 mega-cravings yesterday, one that came about after too many conversations about quitting smoking and then seeing people lighting up on a movie, etc. The second which was after getting in a big ass argument with fiance. I've been so edgy and angry when trying to quit....hated the guilty feeling after having those 2 cigs, 12 small puffs or so.

I'm quitting though, I know I can do this! Made it, cold turkey, to that 3 day point. Might get some NRT in form of gum or something, this shit's tough man...

Psychological addiction is more-so harder than the physical though, tough stuff. Need to quit now, though

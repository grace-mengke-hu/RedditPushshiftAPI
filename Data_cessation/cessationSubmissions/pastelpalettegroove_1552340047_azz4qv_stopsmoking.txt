Moved in a smokers house

So, I have quit smoking for a few months before introducing occasional smoking when going out with smokers and under influence of the alcohol, a conscious decision I have maintained without any problem for the past year and a half. 

But, unfortunately, I have just moved in a house filled with smokers and since then, it has become a lot more difficult not to smoke pretty much everyday. There's no chance they will not smoke inside (it's 7 against 1 at this point). 

I am very much looking for ideas as to how to reinforce my ability to stay away from smoking so frequently, a good kick in the ass I guess. Help!

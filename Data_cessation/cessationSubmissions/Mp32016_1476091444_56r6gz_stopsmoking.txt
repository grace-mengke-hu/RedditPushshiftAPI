6 weeks now ..my brain doesn't work and nothing seems real anymore ..wtf is happening ?

After many failed attempts I have made it 6 weeks so far since my last cig .. I gotta say it's been the most excruciating and miserable experience of my life and wtf I thought I'm supposed to feel better by now. 

Hoping I can get some insight on this ..little background I chewed for bout 10 yrs then quit that for about 6 months then started smoking for about the last 2 years bout 1/2 pack day avg more or less.

Anyway I am constantly in a brain fog it's hard to concentrate on anything. I feel light headed and almost stoned sometimes . I no longer am nterested in women and really people I general. I no longer feel like gong out or socializing at all and Itfeels like I'm pretty much watching my self in some kind of weird quasi 3rd person view like some weird fucked up depressing video game where nothing is real. 

I work out regularly I monitor what I eat I'm in good physical shape 
But this quit has really mentally fucked me up bad and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this and if there's a light at the end of this tunnel??

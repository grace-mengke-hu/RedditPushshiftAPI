Struggling - Learning new habits

Smoking a cigarette isn’t an option. One is too many, and a hundred is never enough!

But I’m struggling right this minute with learning how to live without them.  My concentration is off and I’m having a hard time focusing on my work.  When I smoked, this would be my cue to go out and a have a few cigarettes, clear my head, take a break.  

I guess I can do the same thing, but without a cigarette- take a 10-minute walking break, clear my head.  But I just feel like I’m feeding the mental habit, the ritual of smoking if I do.  Sigh. 

Retraining myself after 35 years of a repeated behavior is going to take a lot of work. 

Thanks for listening!

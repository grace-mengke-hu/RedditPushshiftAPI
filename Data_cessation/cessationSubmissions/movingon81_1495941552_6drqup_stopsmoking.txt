Quitters with depression and anxiety

Hi everyone, I'm new here. I decided to sign up for reddit just because of this forum. 

Just a little about myself.... I've been smoking for 16 years now (boy time really flies) and the whole reason why I started in the first place was incredibly stupid - I had just broken up with my first love and I was incredibly upset with my father and brother and so I started to "punish" them. Incredibly dumb because they didn't even know that I had started smoking. I also did it to punish myself - initially it made me feel so sick that I would usually have to lie down after a cigarette. 

16 years on I'm stuck with this disgusting habit. Picking up smoking is my biggest regret in life!

I have tried numerous times to quit but have always failed... which has been very disheartening.

Anyways, I also have depression (have been on anti-depressants for over 10 years now) and have anxiety. I am wondering if any fellow sufferers have any tips on how to cope when you are depressed or anxious when quitting?

I really want to quit because it is destroying my body. I am always sick and now have chronic pharyngitis and bronchitis. But just the thought of giving it up makes me feel so incredibly anxious and stressed!

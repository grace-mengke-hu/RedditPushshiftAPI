Please, give me some advice and motivation..

Hello!
I've been a smoker for a short time, since early 2017 and today I smoked my last cigarette (I wish it's my last)
I want to stop because I want to save money and improve my health. The girl I like is not a smoker either, and I really don't want to smoke ever again. The thing is tho, I've tried to stop for at least 30 times already and never succeeded. Can you guys, please, give me some advice on how to stop for good? 
Any help and support is appreciated, I really need it. Hope you understand me

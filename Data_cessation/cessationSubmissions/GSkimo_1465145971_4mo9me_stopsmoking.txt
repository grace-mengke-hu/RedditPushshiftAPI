2nd Time Quitting in as Many Months

I'm Ready & Was Ready 2 Months ago, then fell to an urge (I'm Having A Cigarette & I Don't Care) ! This time; having 4 Days 9:40 hrs ; I know that voice is there and I hope I have the strength to be able to do what I need to do ! 
Since a Heart Attack 2 Years Ago I have Started an Exercise & Diet Change ; This Is Going Very Well; now I am acting on being a Non-Smoker : 5 yrs 7 months 19 days ago I Stopped using any form of Alcohol & my life Has Gotten Better Each Day I Wake Up and it's TIME I GET CONTROL OF THE OBSESSION THAT HAS BEEN CONTROLLING ME SINCE I PICKED UP THAT FIRST CIGARETTE 45 years Ago. PLEASE SEND ME ENCOURAGING THOUGHTS & Words of SUPPORT

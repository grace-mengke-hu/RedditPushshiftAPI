100 Days!

Today marks 100 days since my last cigarette. Seeing how this is a fairly common milestone post on this forum, Ive been thinking for the past week how best to describe the changes in my life. Today, I'd like to focus on the biggest thing that I've noticed which is that my primary task in my day to day life is no longer quitting smoking and that I'm now in a position to take on other changes in my life. I still get a craving from time to time but they are no longer as intense or frequent. 

I guess all of this is to say that time takes time and that, for me at least, life doesn't just turn around over night. The biggest reason I wanted to write this, is that I remember in my first few weeks struggling to quit and not seeing all the amazing benefits that others seemed to experience right away and in consequence becoming discouraged. Though the benefits seemed to be longer in coming, I can assure anyone on the fence that they are certainly worth it and today I'm as confident as the moment I quit that I don't want to smoke again.

Tonight's the night. Need some tips please!

Hi! 

Tonight's the night. I'm a 2 packer and I've just started chantix and have the patches and lozenges on deck. It's not so much that I care to quit nicotine as it is smoking. Im a guy who actually loves everything about smoking I need some advice on how to handle:

1) The car! I am in it hours a day for work commute and other reasons and my favorite thing is to smoke and listen to music. How can I handle this sense of loss? 

2) the 'after' cigarette. After food, sex, a workout, etc, smoking feels great. It's almost like a reward! What do you guys do to handle these cravings?

Here are my reasons for wanting to quit:

A) money! Two packs a day at 10.80 each is 21.60 a day. 21.60 a day is over 600 dollars a month? No that can't be right? I hope someone tells me my man is wrong there O__O

B) health - physical and mental. I hate the feeling of getting the anxiety of a nicotine craving. I don't want to have to go outside during the workday etc and I smoke in my room where I sleep! My sleep quality would skyrocket. My pets wouldn't deal with second hand smoke nor would my family. (I'm not a monster, I do take measures to minimize this for the pets ðŸ˜¸). My energy levels would skyrocket, my workout capacity would skyrocket, my breathing during meditation would skyrocket, my weiner will work better (I'm being blunt here! Come on guys!!), my inflammation will go down, my brain will begin to heal from the damage of smoking, and so on.

Help me help myself boys! And ladies! 

Let's do this!!!!

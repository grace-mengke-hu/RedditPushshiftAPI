smoker of <1 year, worried about voice

ok so i have been smoking for about a year but not very heavily; for the first while it was only occasionally, i rarely actually bought them and smoked more socially, but for the past month i've been smoking regularly like a pack a week. i already have allergies which hurt my throat like crazy and the smoking is making it worse, and it's making me sound croaky/hoarse. it usually goes away after i smoke but im worried its starting to affect my voice and make me cough / need to clear my throat more. if i quit smoking now how long till my voice/throat goes back to normal?

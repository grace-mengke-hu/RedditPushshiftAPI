Dreamt about smoking last night

I had a dream last night that I had a drag (1 drag!!) of a smoke. I started panicking that I had failed myself and (of all things) was going to have to reset my badge. 

Haven't had many dreams about smoking, and was surprised to after 37 days. When I woke up it felt good to realize that I hadn't failed myself like that.

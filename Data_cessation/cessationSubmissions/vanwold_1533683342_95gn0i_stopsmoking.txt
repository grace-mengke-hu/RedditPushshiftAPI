3.5 Days, I want a smoke!!!

I'm holding out, but it was so tempting to break down and buy  a pack today, or steal one from the SO, but I'm resisting. The physical  cravings are definitely gone, now its those mental cravings. Every time I think, you can just have one or, is this withdrawal ever going to end??? I remember why I quit: It was hurting me to breathe. Then I remember that these cravings and withdrawals SUCK but I'm through the worst now....I also remind myself that this is the death throes of addiction and it won't always suck this bad.  How long did it take you to stop feeling cravings and start enjoying not smoking?

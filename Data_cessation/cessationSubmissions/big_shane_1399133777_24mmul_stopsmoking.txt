A few thoughts on the mentality around here.

Forgive me if I'm incorrect or assuming too much, but I feel like a lot of the mentality around here is focused on avoiding the negative instead of approaching the positive. I know I'm only 35-ish days in, and I know I didn't have the long history of smoking (I was a half-pack of 99s a day for about a year and a half), but my quit finally stuck because I wasn't trying to not smoke. I simply viewed each moment as if smoking had never been an option, and the cravings would pass. Telling an addict to not get their fix is less successful than telling a child to not eat the cookies while you're out; every time you tell yourself not to smoke, it's reinforcing the temptation and the pattern in your brain, seeding that addiction deeper. Instead, I've found that focusing on the other aspects of life helps to keep the mind off of the cravings, but removing all power from those cravings is where success comes in. Just my thoughts and opinions though, so take them as you shall.

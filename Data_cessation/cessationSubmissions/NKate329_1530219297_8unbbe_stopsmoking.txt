Alcohol with Wellbutrin?

So I’m not trying to binge drink or anything. I’m starting Wellbutrin tomorrow, and it says not to mix with alcohol, but EVERY SINGLE MEDICATION I’ve ever seen says that. The last week of July I’m going to the beach for a week, and it’s my birthday week, and I just want to know if I can have a few drinks. Has anyone ever done this and what was your experience?

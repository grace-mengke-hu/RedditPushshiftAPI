Quit day 23

For anyone out there that is just starting, be strong.  


The first week or so is awful, but if you can resist that, then only the habit will remain.  


I've managed the first week by using an app, paying it ( just so I get myself invested ), putting money into a savings account ( and offering myself rewards with the money saved from cigarettes not smoked ), logging my lapses and the conditions where they happened ( avoiding those conditions ) and logging my triggers ( coffee, alcohol, etc. ) and avoiding those triggers at least 3 days.

I used to substitute coffee for decaf (chicory root has an intense flavor and also very good with the stomach), changed the place I've drank alcohol and the people I've drank it with (non-smokers).

I am happy I am a non-smoker and I hate the period I smoked, it's normal and cool not to smoke and getting your health and fitness in check, not the other way around. Wheezing and coughing is not cool and neither is the lack of energy. 

Today I drink any amounts of alcohol I want and coffee and have no desire to smoke whatsoever.

I don't know what number quit attempt this is, but here goes.

I've quit numerous times before, the longest being just over 7 weeks. I don't feel confident about this one. But confidence is key so I'm trying to accumulate some. Also, in previous attempts I just dove right into quitting without changing my life (still going to bars, hanging with smokers) and it would work for a little bit and those things weren't my trigger. But lately I'll go a day or two without one and then cave, so I'm staying away from other smokers until I feel I can cautiously be around them.

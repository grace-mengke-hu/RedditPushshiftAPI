...and I keep, going and going, and....

I am at 46 days smoke free and it feels soooo good. I have put myself through most of my trigger situations and I have stayed strong!!! I feel like I can do anything. I have tried several times before but this is the longest I have ever gone (except for when I was pregnant, but that was a must for my kiddos!) all of the times I have tried I have used different methods but cold turkey has worked the best for me! Best wishes to all of you starting the smoke free journey.

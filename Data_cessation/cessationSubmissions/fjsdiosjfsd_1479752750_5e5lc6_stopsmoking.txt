49 days!

Going strong. I am anxious as hell and stressed at work right now but I know I'm not going to have a cigarette.

It's wonderful not thinking about cigarettes first thing when I wake up in the morning.

I still get fairly strong cravings maybe once every other day, but I know that if I ignore them/do something else they'll pass.

I had a doctor's appointment for the first time in ~5 years this past week and the doctor offered me nicotine patches and Wellbutrin to help with my quit. Apparently this is how he was able to quit. I said no, because I think at almost 50 days in, the patches will redevelop my nicotine dependence, and the Wellbutrin just isn't necessary.

Best to everyone here! This sub was so helpful in my earlier days, and it's still helpful on days like today when a little part of my brain is telling me that a cigarette would feel good right now.

I'm gonna go eat a tasty lunch instead. After this next meeting... :/

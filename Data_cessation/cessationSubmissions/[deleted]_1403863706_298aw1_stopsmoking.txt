4 weeks without smoking - Sleeping suddenly became really hard

So, I quit smoking cold turkey 4 weeks ago after ~9years of smoking. First three days I had trouble getting sleep. After that my sleeping went back to normal.(Quitting itself has been surprisingly easy!)

Now all the sudden this monday my sleep started to be terrible, waking up every 10-40minutes. Only sleeping 2-5h at a time(including the constant waking up) and now I'm feeling absolutely terrible because of it. Before this I allways slept until I felt refreshed and ready to get out of bed, now I can spend alot of time in bed after waking up feeling super tired wanting to get more sleep but not getting it. Never ever have I experienced any kind of problems with sleep before.
So I'm just asking if anyone else have experienced this or could this be related to something else?
Sleeping is pretty much the only thing I'm thinking about and I'm pretty sure that its just making it worse..
Any tricks or experiences?

negative health effects of smoking

Today i'm back at day one of no smoking.. so throughout the day I'm going to read up on the negative health effects of smoking and how many nasties are in cigarettes. If I feel like having a smoke, remembering how bad it is in my fresh memory helps me not want to smoke.

Here's 3 that got me started:

My uncle passed away today and I didn’t smoke

I don’t know how I didn’t as I wanted one all day and everyone around me was smoking. My uncle did smoke a lot as he had a very tiring job and it seemed to be the only thing that relaxed him. But we all know cigs don’t actually relax you. He was a good man, an honest man who took care of his family. He was like a second dad to me and I’ll always miss him. 

It’s my sixth day today I hope I can pull through.

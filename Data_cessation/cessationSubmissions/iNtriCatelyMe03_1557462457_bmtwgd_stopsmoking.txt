Advice needed - dealing with smokers &amp; cravings

I need advice on how to deal with being surrounded by people who smoke. 

I'm a college student who's home for the summer. Back in February, I decided to quit smoking.

 I've tried to quit smoking numerous times before but this attempt has been the hardest out of all them. I wasn't smoking cigarettes this time, I was smoking a juul. And I was smoking the equivalent of 50 cigarettes a day. The other times I've tried quitting, I've never had these horrible withdrawals or cravings. I never needed to do the nicotine patch steps. 

Being in college, it was easy to become a shut-in and ignore everyone. I turned oblivious to who smoked around me bc I avoided it. Well, it's harder now that I'm home. Everyone in my family smokes. Today, when my family all took their smoke break, I couldn't help but remember when I'd join them. I almost did today. 

It's been four hours since that incident and I still feel shook. Im feeling like I need to smoke so badly. And none of my usual tactics work - taking a walk, chewing gum, watching a show, reading a book, talking to my support system. Nothing is working. 

Also, I've been home for less than 48 hours and I'm feeling super stressed. Being home is currently feeling more stressful than living on campus. 

What can I do now to help me with these cravings and how can I survive the summer?

New here

Hey /r/stopsmoking, 

I've been on and off for about the past two years with my smoking habit. I started mid-college due to a combination of peer pressure and a way to deal with stress. Graduation is only weeks away now, and I am ready to put my foot down this time and start my professional life off on the right path--one that doesn't include slowly killing my body and wasting my funds.

I managed to stay away from cigs for about 2 months this semester, but fell back into the habit after coming back from spring break. More than anything, I crave the excuse that cigarettes afford you to remove yourself from others. Regardless, I'm glad to have found this as a resource. If any of you bother to comment on this, I'd appreciate a bit of advice/comments on moving forward. I think we all understand that there's more to it than just resisting the urge to go out and buy another pack. 

Tl:dr New here. Thanks for the community. Any and all advice/wisdom is vastly appreciated.

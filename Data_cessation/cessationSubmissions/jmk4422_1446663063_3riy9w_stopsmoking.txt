Finally nicotine free but the insomnia persists. Help?

So I'm 80+ days without a cigarette. For the last few weeks I've been limiting myself to one 2mg piece of nicotine gum. Five days ago I stopped taking even that much.

In short? I'm pretty much 100% nicotine free now.

And yet the insomnia continues to plague me. When I manage to go to sleep it's due to sheer exhaustion and even then I wake up constantly. I haven't had a solid 8 hours of sleep in so long I don't even remember what it feels like.

Before you suggest it, yes: I tried sleeping aides (over-the-counter sleeping pills). They helped a bit but made me feel like crap when I had to wake up so I quit taking them.

I would never have guessed that insomnia would be the big side effect of quitting smoking. But in the nearly three months since my last smoke? Yeah, it remains a thing. If you have any advice to share I'd greatly appreciate it.

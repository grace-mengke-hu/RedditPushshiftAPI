Struggling to continue

Today is day 4 of quitting and just really need a place to vent. I am feeling very sad and wallowing a bit and it just seems to keep getting harder to stick with it. My husband and I are going to a bar tonight and I am really worried I won’t be able to stick with it. It is making me feel so sad that I even think I couldn’t handle being around it. I feel so weak.

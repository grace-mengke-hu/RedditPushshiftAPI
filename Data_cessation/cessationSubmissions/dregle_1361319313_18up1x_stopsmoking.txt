I have a few questions for those who have experience or opinions on ecigarettes

If I start smoking an ecigarette, can I keep my badge? If I move to ecigarettes completely, as in smoking it several times a day, do I consider myself a smoker? I bought one to use tonight when I go to a friends house where there will be smoking. I've used one before and I loved it. But does it count as smoking?

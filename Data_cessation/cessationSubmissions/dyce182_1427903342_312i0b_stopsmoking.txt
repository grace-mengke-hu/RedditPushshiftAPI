I think I've quit smoking due to this one simple trick!

Long story short I was riding my motorcycle and got hit by a car. Was in the hospital for a stint and obviously couldn't smoke, then I got home and didn't have any cigarettes with me and haven't been able to leave and get some more. Occasionally I have a huge craving but they been subsiding more and more

TL;DR - Go get hit by a car

I need to quit.

I have been telling myself I need to quit. Have half heartedly tried but have gone back on a whim. It is extra hard that I do drink fairly frequently and I have a lot of packs laying around mostly from China and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.

This past week I have been feeling a bit crumby my throat kind of bothering. Today I wake up and I find it slightly difficult to breath, maybe humidity.. not quite sure. 

I enjoy biking and other activities that can keep me occupied but I am a very restless person and especially love my vices. I am afraid I wont be able to quit or maybe just go back to smoking weed all the time to fill the void.

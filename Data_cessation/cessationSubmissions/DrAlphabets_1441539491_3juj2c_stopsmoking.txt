Went for a run

I've gone back to school and that means free gym membership so I went to the gym on Friday and was able to run on the treadmill for half an hour.

At some point my chest hurt a bit but honestly it felt better to just feel how much more I can do as a recovering smoker. Guys the possibilitit's are limitless!

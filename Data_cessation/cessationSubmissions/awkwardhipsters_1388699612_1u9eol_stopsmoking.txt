Something dawned on me today...

I had a moment today after the gym. I wanted a cigarette. It's been so long, I've done so well, but I had the craziest craving.

So I went to the shop, and someone I know from the pub I work at was there. We talked about smoking and they said "I've just ran out, so I've gotta get another pack"

and then I had this moment while looking at all the different brands. I realised, smoking is ultimately my decision. I can choose to waste all the time I've spent as a non smoker, and start smokign again, or I can just go home and let the craving pass.

This moment was special to me because I'm so used to just walking to the shop and buying a pack of cigarettes without even thinking about it. 

This was the first time I'd been to a shop to buy a pack since I stopped smoking. 
It's easy, next time you're in the shop to buy a pack, next time you see your personal brand right in front of you, ask yourself if you want to waste everything and let yourself down. Be more in control, be conscious about what you're doing instead of letting the craving distract you!


I'm still craving right now. I've got that uncomfortable feeling, my mouth is filling with saliva and has a slight buzzing in it.
But I will not smoke, I will not waste my time. I mean, what's the point, I;m a non smoker!!! ;)

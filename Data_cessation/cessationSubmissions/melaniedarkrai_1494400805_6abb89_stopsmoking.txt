How to avoid smoking at work

I'm a cashier at a store that sell cigarettes, not too busy, but it can get stressful. These are the times I really want a smoke, and I hate it because it's incredibly convenient there; we have tester cigarettes for customers, and it's incredibly hard to resist the temptation to have one. Please, can someone give me tips on how I can resist?

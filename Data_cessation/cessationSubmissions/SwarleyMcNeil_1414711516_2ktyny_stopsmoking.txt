Quitting for the 3rd time

I wanna make it 3rd time lucky and quit forever. I made it to 3 weeks last time I tried before I thought i'd be okay to have "just one". I soon found out you can't have just one.

My last smoke was 11am'ish on Monday. Which is about 84hrs ago. I'm now getting sweats, feeling tired, feeling agitated. I'm going to go mad. What can I do.

Doing this cold turkey btw, I don't think I can manage it any other way.

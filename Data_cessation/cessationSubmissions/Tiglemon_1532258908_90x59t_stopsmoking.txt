I think I'm allergic to smoke. Learning, after I slipped up and had a smoke last week.

It started as a sneeze and then running nose. I had a smoke after slipping from a 56 day streak. The next day was the sneezing. ha ha. 

I'm kinda happy as now it looks like I am allergic to smoke inside of me. Has this happened to anyone? 

Anyways I'm continuing my quit. Someone said look at slipping as part of the process of quitting, this comment helped me get back on the quit journey. And previously...60 days I'd have smoked 600 smokes, I had 3 and got right back to the quit.  So I'm not giving in to smoking no never!!!!!! 

I love myself like this.. smell free, food tastes yummy and I have more energy and I'm funnily alot calmer. 

But the biggest lesson is I have to be here with this sub through and through. Helps sooooo much. Thank you all!!

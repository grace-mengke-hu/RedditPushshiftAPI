Question for those who have quit smoking: in the months that followed, did you still smell/taste the smoke when you had a cold?

My mom quit smoking on December 28 after getting a tooth extracted and a bone graft done. She was told she had a much better chance of a successful recovery if she quit. So she did - and I’m so proud of her. The first few weeks were rough with withdrawal symptoms. As time passed, she started feeling better about it. (Not sure if it’s important, but she started with the patch, then went for acupuncture. After she had the acupuncture, she was told to not have any nicotine products. She has followed those directions.)

Last week, she got a cold and since then (she’s still recovering from it), she’s complaining of smelling and tasting the smoke in her nose and mouth. I read something interesting [here](https://whyquit.com/joels-videos/general-warning-about-getting-colds-or-flu-after-quitting/) about this - but I’m not sure if it’s relevant. What’s concerning me about this is that she says smelling and tasting the smoke is really making her want to smoke. And unfortunately, she says the smell and taste is becoming more intense.

She was a smoker for 43 years, but she feels that if she can quit for 100 days (we’re on day 80), she can be a non-smoker for the rest of her life.

So, has anyone else had this happen before? Will it go away when the cold does? Any advice for her to cope with this?

Thanks in advance :)

Why in the hell would you want to do that?

175 days here. The other day I was drinking beer on my roof (Brooklyn) with my roommate and watching the sun set when I had the most powerful craving I've had since week 2 or so. Combination of work stress, friends stress, alcohol, and the warming weather here just made me want nothing but to buy a pack of smokes and burn through them all, one after the other, on a 3 or 4 hour walk. I wanted nothing but to be an hour away from my house and have *no choice* but to keep smoking. Ridiculous right? But I wanted it like nothing ever before. And so I told my roommate, in the offhand complaint type of way I have. She's a never smoker and is used to hearing me complain about the passing craving.

"I want to walk across the bridge and just chain-smoke," I told her.

"Why in the hell would you want to do that?" she said, genuinely confused.

"Because I'm addicted to nicotine," I admitted.

"Fuck it," she said. I agreed. We finished our beers, I went downstairs and did not smoke. The feeling passed as soon as I was off the roof.

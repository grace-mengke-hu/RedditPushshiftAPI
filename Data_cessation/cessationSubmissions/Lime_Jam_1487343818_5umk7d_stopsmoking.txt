Smoking just makes me feel ill?

I started smoking 3 weeks ago after an extremely stressful event. It helped at first with anxiety, but now it makes me feel more anxious and generally lethargic. Is this normal? I smoke between 2-5 a day but want to quit again but there are times I absolutely crave a cigarette.

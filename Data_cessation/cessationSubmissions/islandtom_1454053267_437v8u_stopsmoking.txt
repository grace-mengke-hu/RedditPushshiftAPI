New years quitters unite. We are 4 weeks down!

Loving the purple 4 in my badge. 28 years old and 14 years a smoker. Proud to be a non smoker again. 

Lots of people mock new years resolutions but some of us need a significant date to help stop. It was just one piece in the jigsaw of my preparation to quitting. 

Congratulations to everyone who is still going strong. It really is not an easy task. I want to say a big thankyou to everyone who posts on here. Regular reading on the board has helped me massively 

Here's to the next 4 weeks!!!

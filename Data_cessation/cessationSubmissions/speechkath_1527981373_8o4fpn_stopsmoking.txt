You guys want to laugh?

I’m on Day 4.  A while ago I told my daughters that after exams they could have friends over for a pizza and movie night. So at this moment I have 9 shrieking, squealing, hyper 7 and 11 year olds here for 4 hours.  I think I win the timing award...

But I’m not smoking no matter what.

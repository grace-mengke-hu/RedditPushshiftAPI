Are you lurking right now? Do you really want to stop smoking?

Then stop right now. There will NEVER be an easier time to stop, than right this moment. It won't be easier before school begins, or when school ends, or when summer is over, or when summer begins, or when you have time to go to the gym, or when you have to finish an exam, or an assignment, or you go on vacation from work, etc.

There will never be an easier time to stop smoking than right this very second.

Do it.

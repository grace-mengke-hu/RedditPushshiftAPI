Day 2 progress

No withdrawal pangs thanks to Allen Carr. 

No craving. I kinda don’t want to trigger myself and go for cigarette walks with people at work. It’s cold outside anyway. I feel more sleep than I am normally. (4-5 hours in a weekday regularly worked better than yesterday’s 7 hours of sleep) I am aware of the mood swings. Yesterday I started crying on something stupid but I was sure I didn’t want to smoke. I can’t wait to kick this but I am convincing myself I am already a non-smoker. Just my body will adapt it to the normal.

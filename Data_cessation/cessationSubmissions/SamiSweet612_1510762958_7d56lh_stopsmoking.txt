Stress triggering a craving

Ahhh!!! Stressful email is currently triggering a craving in me. I'm so tempted to leave work and buy a pack but I know I will smoke the entire thing and just fall into the trap again. 

Trying to remember all those words that got me through yesterday without a smoke:

- "One is too many and a thousand is never enough"
- "Never take another puff"
- "This is drug addiction"

I have to keep my vow to never pick up another cigarette, despite the stress that I will encounter. I have to know that a cigarette will not fix my problems. I will not feel better after I smoke a cigarette. I will not feel relaxed. My problem will still exist regardless of if I smoke. 

I can do this. I can resist smoking yet another cigarette. I will NOT give in today.

Total shit week, but I made it.

I quit last Monday. Used nicotine patches for all of 2 days. I had to stop because the adhesive made my skin itch and burn, which irritated me, which made me want a cigarette even more.

Been using an e-cig maybe 2 or 3 times a day. Only when I find myself getting really agitated. One of the filters on this thing has a much nicotine as a whole pack and that sucker lasted a whole week. I feel like that's a big improvement from me smoking a pack a day. 

Saturday morning I found out my dad died the night before. We weren't especially close, but he was still my dad. I didn't cave and smoke. I didn't see the point. I asked myself "How is smoking going to help me?" I managed to stay strong during a very stressful, sad situation, and now feel like my determination is solid. 

I really think this is it. This is the last time I'll have to quit.

Day 4... Does it get easier?

Hi everyone,

As the title suggests I am currently on Day 4 (almost 5) and I don't know if it's Sunday blues but I am really struggling today.  Myself and my SO quit at the start of the New Year, though he has a two day head start on me as he went cold turkey from day one, whereas I tried vaping for first two days... During these two days I felt vaping was making me want to buy cigarettes, so I decided to take cold turkey approach, which I am on day 4 of now...

I have tried to quit before, but I can honestly say I have NEVER went this long, that maybe sounds silly when so many people have lasted longer... My husband is coping well, he has done this before and lasted months, but I don't want to bombard him as he doesn't need to be reminded all the time..

I suppose my question is, does it get easier? Will I stop wanting to kill dead things? Will I stop crying at every given chance? I am also starting a new job tomorrow and it's all getting on top of me... Any advise would be really appreciated :)

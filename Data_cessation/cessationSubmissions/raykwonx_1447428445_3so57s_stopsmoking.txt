DAY 29 of attempt number...I've lost count.

I've tried to quit smoking at least 10 times in the past but never made it past a couple weeks, even with the patch, gum, pills, Alan Carr's book. 

I'm currently using an e-cig, this is the longest I've ever made it. I already find myself using my e-cig less and less too. 

I no longer wake up coughing!

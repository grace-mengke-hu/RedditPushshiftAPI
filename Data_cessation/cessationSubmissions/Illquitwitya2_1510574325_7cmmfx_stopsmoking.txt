72 hours!

Apart from the occasional headache, staring off into the distance for 5 to 10 minutes every now and then, and having cravings every so often I'm doing alright so far.

To the rest of y'all that also recently quit, I highly recommend exercising and drinking more water than you normally do. I believe both have helped decrease the effects of withdrawal, plus the increased exercise helps with a good night's sleep.

Now, I believe it is time for some tea and a good long walk.

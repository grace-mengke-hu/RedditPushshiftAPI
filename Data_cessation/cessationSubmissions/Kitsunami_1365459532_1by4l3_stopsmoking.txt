Is cold turkey really ineffective or do people recite this excuse because it's hard?

Been working up the courage to begin my descent into withdrawals for awhile now. And I am wondering if anyone had any personal experiences to share in the dilemma of weening vs cold turkey. 

Did the weening just delay you quitting without making it any easier? Did you find yourself more susceptible to relapse with cold turkey?

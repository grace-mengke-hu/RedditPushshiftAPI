Was around smokers last night

So some people came over last night, and most of them are smokers. I experienced maybe a one second craving, and then I found I didn't care about cigarettes. I didn't want one. I hung out with them outside (no smoking in the house!) and other than that one second, I wasn't bothered. Which is a good thing, because normally when you're trying to quit something, and being around people who are having the thing you want to quit means relapse. So I'm optimistic that this quit will take!

Best Motivation to quit

My best friend is going to become a father, and he and his wife find it hard to quit smoking. They know me as a chain smoker, and when they came to talk to me thinking that id understand, I made a deal with them: I quit with them for the sake of the baby. 

I get my strength to quit from giving them strength to quit. I have to stay strong for them, and they for the baby. 

It's on. I'm not a smoker anymore. 

It's been fun, but like with so many other things in life  -  I'm done. 

**EDIT 1:** It's been 4 days now and I don't miss it one bit. I don't call myself a "quitter", or say that "I quit". I am simply a non-smoker now, and I feel totally free. Don't miss it one bit... It's incredible. After 17 years, and all I've had to do is "not smoke". I've been keeping myself busy working out, studying, working, learning new stuff, and I'm already noticing improvements in my condition: can breathe better, have more energy, not afraid of being indoors (where you cant smoke, normally), and not checking to see if I have enough for the evening on my way home from work. It's fantastic.

**EDIT 2:** 9 days now. I dont even miss it! I don't feel as if i'm missing out on something. It's a feeling of a total freedom.

**EDIT 3:** 52 days now. I don't miss it, I don't think about it, and I'm saving so much money :-)

**EDIT 4:** 77 days now!

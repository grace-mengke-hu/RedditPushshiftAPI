Need some advice

I’ve been smoking since I was probably 13 years old (10 years). I’ve tried to quit many times in the past but this time I’m feeling quite determined. I have 2 more cigarettes in my pack so I’m going to smoke them and then that’s it for me.  Any helpful tips or tricks to sticking with it? What did you do to help you quit? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

New born non smoker

Posted a little ditty on day 4. Tomorrow will mark 2 weeks!  Feeling great:) I litterly got a calendar and started marking X's on days just a reminder that I got this and it's one day at a time.  Not another puff not ever!  Also joined orange theory fitness with the $$ I'm saving!  Boy am I sore and out of shape and my lungs burn something fearice, but I owe it to myself and my family to stick around as long as possible #winning.

Sober from alcohol almost 90 days after a decade of binging. I now want to quit smoking

It's baffling to me so much of the "quit smoking" propaganda is paid for by the tobacco companies. It makes me question which method of quitting has a persons best interest in mind, and the most success.

I've read most of "The Easy Way" about 4 years ago. I had a little success for 30 days, then after a bad day bought a pack and am worse than I was. 

I'd like to ask what worked for you, what I need to do, what resources are the best, but ultimately I think I just need a support system similar to what I have for my alcohol recovery, though I would appreciate feedback. I may try the easy way again. I have a vaporizer but if I learned anything from that book it's just another form of convincing myself I need nicotine. I know I dont, but it's so damn habitual mt mind seemingly over takes my body to where I feel like my inner "demon" will always win.

Thanks for being such an awesome forum. With the different subs, this place has gotten my life back on track in a few different ways! I hope to pay it back here.

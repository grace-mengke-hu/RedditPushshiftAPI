Sinuses and nasal passages are fucked. Need advice.

Haven't had a smoke in two weeks. Been nicotine free for almost a week now. I've never felt better, except for my sinuses. The sinus pressure is awful and I have terrible headaches because of it. Sometimes it feels like I can't breath out of my nose, like their closing up or something is blocking them. My mucus is clearish white and occasionally a little clump of blood comes out when I try to blow my nose. Is this my body healing the damage from cigarettes? Allergies? Should I see a doctor about this? No cravings for cigs, just tired of feeling sick. I thought quitting was supposed to make me feel better, not shitty like this.

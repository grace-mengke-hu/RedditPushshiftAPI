3 Puffs of Regret.

I had been out of town, and completely sober, for about a month. The night that I got back in town I went out with my friends for a few drinks. That night marked 35 days of not smoking. My friends stepped outside for a cigarette, and I told them that I would keep them company. I asked one of them for a cigarette and lit it up. After about 3 puffs one of my other friends, who knew I was quitting, bursts out of the bar. Hilarity ensues. For about the next minute my friend is chasing me around the bar parking lot while I'm puffing the cigarette. I finally drop it and immediately regret my decision to light it up in the first place. Now I'm back to square one. The good thing is that while I was smoking it was not enjoyable. It didn't satisfy me like it used to. Hopefully this time I will be able to quit for good. Later that night my friend, the one who chased me, I and if either one of us smoked a cigarette he would have to provide the other with an all expense paid weekend trip to Las Vegas. Wish me luck.

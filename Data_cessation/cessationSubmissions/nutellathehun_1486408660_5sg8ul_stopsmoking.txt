I feel like I'm slipping

I would really hate myself if I did. I haven't had so much as one hit in at least 2 months. I can breathe more , my car doesn't smell like shit, and my anxiety has gotten better. But the cravings are throwing me off. I hear from people who quit years ago and still have cravings and it worries me. I know it probably depends on the person. But today I've had the worst cravings since I quit and it's throwing me off because I've done so well. I think about how I can breathe better, but not much better since I still have asthma. And I'm like "what's the point?". (Obviously the point is not getting cancer or triggering an asthma attack or being able to make it up a flight of stairs without gasping for air lol). Idk I'm just starting to miss some aspects of it. My boyfriend still has most of a pack left over from when he was rationing them to me daily. I could just take one, but who knows if that'll satisfy me until the next big craving 2 more months from now or if it'll trigger a relapse. Man, if only I could go back and warn 15 year old me of how shitty this would be huh

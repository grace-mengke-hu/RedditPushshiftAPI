9 days after quit VAPING with Allen's Carr book

I had to quit vaping, not smoking. I was a vaper for 4 years and I could live simply without cigarettes. The problem was that I could "smoke" even 5 or 6 "packs" a day with my e-cig. I was just doing everything with my friend, e-cigarette. I couldn't relate to all words from Allen Carr's book but i tried to beat this nicotine monster from my brain. Everyone knows that 0 mg e-liquid can taste good even for non smoker, so when I was reading about the worst taste ever in ciggaretes, i tried to find comparsion to it in electronic cigarettes. I was thinking about burn coils and big coughs soon after too long puffs. And it helped me so much. The opinion that I want to deliver is that Allen's book works as well on everybody. I feel satisfied becouse i tried to quit for 1 year and now is the time that I can do it with pleasure. How is with you, ex vapers? Have you had any problems to quit e-cigarette?

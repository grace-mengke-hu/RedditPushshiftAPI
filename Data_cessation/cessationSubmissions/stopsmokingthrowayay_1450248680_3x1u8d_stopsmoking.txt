I am struggling

I haven't had a smoke in about 2 months (please no good work circle jerk abut two months smoke free bullish). There is the initial addiction thing and then there is what comes after. I can't sleep I can't focus, I my emotions chaos, i am getting anxiety, some paranoia, and I am doing stupid things. I was worried that vaping/caffeine were contributing to it but i have cut down on both.  I haven't had a smoke in 2 months and i have never felt worse. Is this normal?

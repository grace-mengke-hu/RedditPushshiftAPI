Iboga for quitting smoking - not for the feint of heart!

So a few weeks ago I went to Holland to take part in an Iboga ceremony. Iboga is a psychedelic plant from West Africa that is consumed by the Bwiti tribe during rights-of-passage ceremonies and has recently generated some interest due to it's remarkable ability to interrupt addictions, most notably opiate addiction. 

I went for a number of reasons; depression, porn addiction, smoking, alcohol abuse, low sex drive and generally miserable all the time, but I wanted to share how successful Iboga has been for me stopping smoking. 

Personally, during my 15 hour long trip I saw visions of my childhood, had out-of-body experiences (such as being a gorilla) and in the process exorcised dozens of my demons, including self-hatred, guilt, perfectionism and compulsive behaviour. I also had a sort of spiritual awakening, where I felt the connection of all living things and understood more about the living universe.  

After the experience, I lay in the grass as the effects wore off. I could smell the flowers, grass and my own pungent odour from the hours of sweating under the influence. I've never smelt like that before. It was beautiful!

A bit later after some food, the thought popped into my head that I might have a cigarette, a thought that popped in due to shear habit as always coming along after eating. But this time, instead of feeling like I had to smoke, or that I was missing out by not smoking, I simply made the following deal with myself:

"If I can smoke that cigarette and keep this heightened sense of smell and taste then I'll do it... if I lose the beauty of these flowers and their aroma then sorry... it's just not worth it!"

Havent smoked since, haven't wanted to smoke, have no withdrawal and feel amazing as a result! 

Now, I don't know exactly how it worked. Iboga is a strange thing and a hell of a lot of stuff happened both during the journey and after. My guess is that Iboga reset my hormone levels so that withdrawal didn't happen, as well as helping me understand the reasons I smoked and find a psychological reprogramming such that cigarettes no longer had power over me. 

There was another smoker in the group that I should mention too... she had smoked for 30 years and tried quitting with every method under the sun, including Allen Carrs method. She realised through a series of visions that when she was 15 and first moved away from her strict parents, the first thing she did was buy a pack of cigarettes. To her subconscious, cigarettes represented freedom and autonomy, and that's why it was so hard for her to stop smoking. Once she realised that, she figured out that her freedom came from within, not from the cigarettes, and thus her smoking addiction was gone too. 

Now, Iboga is a big ordeal, it's long, hard and will show you the cold hard truth about your behaviour in life. But it is a very gentle and loving experience that reminds you of what you love about yourself too!

Use with caution, but if quitting has been tough for you then it might be worth a look, particularly if you have some psychological issues that need resolving too.

It's like 10 years of therapy in a night, but you'll know if you're ready for that. 

For the record, since the ceremony I have:
-quit smoking
-stopped drinking alone or to get drunk
-not looked at porn
-reconnected with my parents
-stopped YouTube addiction
- cured my social anxiety
- found my courage
- gave my number to a girl on the street for the first time in my life. 

peace and love fellow quitters! It's much easier not to smoke than you think, you just need to change the way you think :-)

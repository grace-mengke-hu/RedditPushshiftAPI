I'm new, starting today

Hi all,

Today is my first day of being smoke free. I've tried unsuccessfully three times in the past. Does anyone have any suggestions to help me through this process?

In the past I've tried the patch and the gum, neither seemed effective for me. 

This time around I am feeling much more dedicated to being a non smoker. Any help would be appreciated!

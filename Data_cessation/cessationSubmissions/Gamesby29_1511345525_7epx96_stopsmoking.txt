Currently on Day 3, and I'm finding this morning very difficult

I am currently on Day 3 and this morning I have been finding it very difficult. I can't stop thinking about cigarettes and just popping to the shop and buying a pack. I'm finding it hard to concentrate on my work, and feel as though I've not been a very enjoyable person to be around this morning as I'm being very quiet and a bit moody. 

The only thing that is keeping me going at the moment is just thinking that I know my girlfriend hates it, and does not want me smoking. She said a few days ago that she wants me being healthy, and that if I'm smoking there's obviously the chance that we might not share a healthy life together, etc. 

Sorry if this post is a bit all over the place, I'm just rushing to try and get this post out before I relapse and go and buy a pack, like I have done so many times in the past...

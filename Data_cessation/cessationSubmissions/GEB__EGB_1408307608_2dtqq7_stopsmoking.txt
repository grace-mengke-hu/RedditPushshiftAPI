Stopping Today

Hi
Im a 28 yo M who has smoked on and off since being a teenager.  I have gone long periods smoke free, have used way too much gum and other NRT with little success.  I have a stressful career in medicine and had a difficult break up and use smoking a total crutch when things get crazy.  

I know it sounds weird and kind of fucked up, but I think that I have thought of cigarettes as my "best friend" in a way, in that through all different events they were one thing I could turn to to make me feel better, to clear my mind, a total mental dependence...almost masochistic in the sense that I knew I was harming myself but that somehow gives me a weird comfort, like a weird form of self loathing and pity when life gets hard.  

Anyway, Ive decided that Im too old for this anymore, and that that mindset is really immature and unhealthy and I want to kick it for good, forever. I have seen the horrors of cigarette effects on health first hand, its such a miserable death, and I just don't want that to be me.  I need to act now.

Ive been reading everything here and I find it really motivational.  So just wanted to say thank you for everyone who described their personal successes and failures before me, and I want to use this thread to motivate myself further and just have a place to relate with other likeminded people working towards the same goal.  Best of luck!

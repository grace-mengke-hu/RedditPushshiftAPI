19 Hours In...

Hi, all - I've really enjoyed reading your posts.  Very helpful and inspiring.  Especially the ones from long-time quits telling us babies it's all worth it!  I've smoked for 40 years and have tried many times to quit.  This time I will do it. It's been 19 hours since my last cig. Hasn't been too bad.

Wellbutrin for Smoking Cessation

 I'm on day 2 of wellbutrin for smoking cessation, currently one per day, bumping up to 2 per day on Saturday.  
Anyone have any advice? I haven't had any adverse side effects like I did previously on anti-depressants, just noticing lots of energy and like my brain is racing a mile a minute. But looking for tips and tricks on really quitting smoking as I'm concerned it won't work.

Also, in terms of weight loss. I have about 30 pounds to lose and I know that wellbutrin can help with weight loss. Any advice on maximizing it's effects but in a healthy manner?

Thanks!

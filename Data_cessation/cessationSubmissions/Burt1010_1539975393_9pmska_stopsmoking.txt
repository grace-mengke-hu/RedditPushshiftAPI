Tomorrow is the big day!

So I've decided that tomorrow is the day I'm going to stop smoking for good. I've managed to stop for a couple of weeks before but failed whilst drinking alcohol. This time I'm going to be vaping and slowly lowering the nicotine amount weekly and will be trying to avoid alcohol as much as possible. Any tips or tricks for me to keep in mind would be greatly appreciated!

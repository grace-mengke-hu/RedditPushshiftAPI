Six months in, I need a hand.

I quit a little over six months ago.  I've found myself free of cravings for cigarettes but I never quite feel 'satisfied'.  I chew gum all the time.  Pretty much all day.  This was my response after I quit using nicotine gum.  Gum handles the oral fixation.  Still though, I know I'm not getting the same chemical rewards from gum and cookies as I would get from a cigarette.  Hopefully I'm being clear enough.  Any ideas?

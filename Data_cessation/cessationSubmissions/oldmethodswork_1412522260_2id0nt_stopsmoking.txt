100 days again!

I hit 100 days back in 2013 before relapsing last August. After a stunt between not smoking for a few days and then smoking for a few days, on and off for about 9 months, I finally gave up.

What I learned:

Ge gentle on yourself. Extremely gentle. When you mess up, don't worry about it. Just wash the memory away and keep working on changing your habits. 

Allen Carr's book is nice, but focusing on what changes a habit is even better. "The Power of Habit" is what truly got me through this habit.

You will still have urges, even at day 100 or 200 for that matter. But it gets way easier, and honestly compared to feeling like shit every day and just wishing I could quit, it is 1,000,000 times better to only want nicotine for a half hour or hour every few days or week. 

No matter how you quit, you are now a non-smoker. You don't smoke, not on any occasions. You can't be a weekend warrior with nicotine, you can't decide to smoke just one to see if you beat the habit, and you can't replace one form of nicotine with another. No matter how long you postpone quitting, you will have to go through the misery at some point. But honestly, it's never nearly as bad as your brain wants you to believe it is.

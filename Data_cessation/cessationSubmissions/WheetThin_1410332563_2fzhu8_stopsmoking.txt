One week tomorrow at noon!

I've been using a fancy smancy ecig to help. I was anywhere from 5-10 a day smoker for about 4 years. Much heavier on weekends when drinking and when I was bartending. 

I am using a 12mg nicotine liquid for my vapor, but I am worried I may only be increasing my addiction to nicotine, even though I haven't had a puff for this long. Even with major stress going on in my life (SO moved away, finances, semester starting again) I have had major cravings, but I've yet to give in. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?

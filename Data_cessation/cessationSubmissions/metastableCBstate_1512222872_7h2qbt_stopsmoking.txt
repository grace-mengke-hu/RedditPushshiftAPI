Thinking of quitting for a while, need some advice

Ive been smoking for one and a half years, about half a pack a day. Been thinking of quitting for a while, but I have two worries

Firstly, im double majoring mechanical and aerospace engineering so I have one or two exams each week, Im really worried about fucking up my grades because I cant perform without cigarettrs, but I also feel like ill lose the motivation at the end of the semester in two months

Secondly, even though its awesome that there are people here that quit for two/three years, It really worries me when they talk about a craving or a dream where they smoke. Makes me feel like im in it for life.

Thanks a bunch.

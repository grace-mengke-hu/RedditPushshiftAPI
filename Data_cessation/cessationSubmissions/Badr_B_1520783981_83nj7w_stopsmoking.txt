My friend stopped cigarets but smokes Joint with tobacco ?

I don't know how he managed it. First he quit 5 days, then now and then he smokes a joint. Like every 2/3 day, sometimes he doesn't smoke for a day, and when he does, it's only at night. He told me that he doesn't have any Nicotine craving. How did he do it? Because it goes against all what I believed before, I thought it was impossible to take any form of nicotine once you stop. Thank you

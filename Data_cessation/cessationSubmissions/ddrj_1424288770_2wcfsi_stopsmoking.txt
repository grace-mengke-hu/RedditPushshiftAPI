New and had some thoughts on Allen Carr easy way

Hi all,

7 year smoker here. I've tried to quit multiple times and never succeeded. I've just read Allen Carr's easy way and I'm not sure what exactly happened other than I'm not having the usual cravings by now that I usually would during my previous attempts to quit.

Have you ever heard the saying that the map is not the territory? I think this is basically what makes his book so distinct and effective than other quitting methods. He provides you an alternative map (quitting is actually easy unlike what media would have you believe) meanwhile deconstructing and removing your past beliefs (that you need a cig to relax or when you're bored etc). 

Great great great book. This is why I think it's been so effective for me personally. I didn't think that a book would help me quit but I was wrong. So here I am saying I stand corrected and I am ready to enjoy the benefits of a smoke free life.

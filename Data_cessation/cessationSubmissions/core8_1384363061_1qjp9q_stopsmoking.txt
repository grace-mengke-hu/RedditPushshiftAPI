Stopped smoking because of a stupid reason.

I am 19 years old male who live in Denmark, Europe. First time i smoked a was at the end of 7th grade (14 years old). Around 6 months ago i decided to stop smoking regularly which worked fine but i just couldn't stop smoking when alcohol is involved (usually at parties).


Last weekend at a party i was dancing with this extremely hot girl who i kissed with and as i saw disgust in her eyes she asked me if i smoked and while i was about to answer she walked away since i could see that she couldn't stand the smell and taste at all.


This is the first time that i've encountered this. It's rare since more than 60% of young people in Europe smoke but this encounter made me stop smoking all together. I know that it's stupid but it made me realize how disgusting the smell and taste of smoking was for me when i was a non-smoker.

Yet another attempt to quit and Mickey Mouse is responsible. Introducing myself...

I've been an on and off smoker since I was 24. Many attempts have been made to ditch it all together through various methods the last 14 years. I started quitting again today. I set an appointment with my Dr. To talk about the smoking cessation program. Funnily enough, my fiance scheduled a trip for a Disneyworld nighttime event the week before I see the doctor. Disney just eliminated their smoking areas. I thought I'd just take a nicotine patch to get me through the visit. Instead, I'm making a go of actually quitting instead of picking right up after we leave the park. I put a patch on around 2am (I keep odd hours) Here goes nothing. I know the worst thing I can do is pick up one cigarette after I've given them up. I wasn't smoking from Dec. 2017 to sep. 2018. Due to stressors, I bought one pack. Next thing I know, I was smoking solid until today. It's funny to think that damned mouse helped motivate me. I have a hundred reasons to stop but I really wanted to get my habit out of the way to have a pleasant trip. I'm glad I found this subreddit today. It's good to know I won't be alone this time.

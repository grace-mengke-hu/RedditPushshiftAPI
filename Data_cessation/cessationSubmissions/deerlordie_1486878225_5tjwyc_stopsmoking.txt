Has anyone experienced quitting one type of smoking, but not the other?

I've been trying to convince myself to quit smoking cigarettes, and can't count how many times I've downloaded an app only to delete it the next morning. Part of my issue is that I'm disabled and currently not working, which leaves all too much idle time, and the other factor is that marijuana is a huge part of my medicine regime. I've tried edibles and vaping/dabbing, but they don't work well with my GI issues. I know how much smoking cigarettes increases my daily pain, and feel there must be a way to quit even while smoking weed... right?

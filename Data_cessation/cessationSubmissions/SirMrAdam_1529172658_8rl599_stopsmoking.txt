Want to quit, whats the communities opinion on hypnosis?

For a little preface, although Im sure unnecessary to the community, I have smoked for about 12 years now (am 30) and have tried to quit multiple times. I have attempted using prescription drugs and by god did they get me to stop smoking but I just couldn't do the vivid dreams associated with the medication; this was about 4 years ago, Im back to about a pack a day at this point. Oddly enough it was also an anti-depressant and I became depressed after dropping the medicine and picked back up smoking, irony. Further down that route I have never been a pill person, I rarely take anything to stop a headache etc. I more than anything would like to quit smoking, but understand I have to curb my habit of smoking outside(I detest the smell inside); I'm a botanist and this is a very difficult scenario to break, I've attempted straws/toothpicks and even an unlit cigar. Id say its mental but then my grumpy self comes around after hours without a good old "cancer stick". (I understand the negative effects neurologically)

I've heard great success from hypnosis and would like to hear the communities opinion on this treatment. I know a lot of addiction treatment has to do with habit forming behavior, and you know we actively combat those habits to no avail, so could the psychological effects of hypnosis help? Is it a pseudo-science?

I know I can search for answers, maybe even the question already being asked but I would like a more modern, up-to-date and communicable opinion?

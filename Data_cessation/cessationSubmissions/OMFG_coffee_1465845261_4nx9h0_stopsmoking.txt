2 weeks today and I have ZERO energy

Hi everyone! I officially quit 2 weeks ago and this is the longest time I've gone without cigarettes in over a decade. I always smoked at least a pack a day.. 

I'm super excited about this accomplishment but I am also so freaking tired and sleepy all the time. It's pretty much impossible for me to force myself out of bed in the morning when my alarm goes off. I'm not usually an early bird anyway but it's been extra hard lately. Like rolling out of bed at 1:30 pm hard. And still wanting to sleep hard.. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Or can it be something else and I'm just blaming this on quitting smoking?

Help with Quiting W/H both smokers since 13-15 give or take.

We have both been smoking since around 13-15 years old.   We are both in our 30s I am 33 almost 34.  I have tried to quit smoking 3 separate times over the years.  Most recently I have flung out a carton of Smokes out my truck window. (Truck Driver) Mostly local.  I did good Quit smoking for about 3 days with few smokes in between. I think I had 3 for those 3 days.  Its mainly after I eat I want to smoke and sex those are about the hardest of times. 
 
 But ever since I have tried to quit I am smoking more than ever.  I am up to almost 2.5 packs a day wife is steady at one pack a day as useual.  It has to be a team effort I know.  She is the most stubborn women I know.  My boss has offered e-cigs but I have tried those the one I had didn't have enough battery to last me through my shift.

I do fine  when I am around non-smokers I have gone 9 hours due to me in a non-smoking truck with an employee that didn't smoke. Not once did I crave a smoke.  Just need little push in the rear with me and the wife any helpful links ect.

Question about quitting with patches. I’m having mixed reactions to them and can’t quite gauge what’s going on.

I’ve been using the high dose patches since I quit ( 18 days I think). Over last 5/6 days I’ve been forgetting to put on the patch till midday, then not until 2-3 pm. I want to make this as easy and successful as I can and have no problem with using the patches, but what I want to know is - if I’m not feeling like I need them to the point of not even remembering or noticing I’m missing out or having serious craving, should I just stop them and not move on to the next step lower dose ones or is that a recipe for failure? I had decided to not wear it today at all and got to about 4:30 pm but then had a fight with my teenager ( I was a bit of a dick tbh) and thought oh shit am I just being angry and unreasonable bc I haven’t used the patch today so I put it on at that point. Help please! From those that have experienced this before. 
My smoking history is been smoking for 25 years ( 43, now) and only quit when I was pregnant 18 years ago. Haven’t tried to quit since then until now. It has been super easy so far. Haven’t had to battle super severe cravings so far. Many thanks for any advice/ thoughts 🙏🏻

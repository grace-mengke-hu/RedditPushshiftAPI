Day 4

Day 4 you guys! Wasn't a new years resolution to quit, it just kind of happened. I was out of smokes on Sunday, realized I've been smoking a pack a day for way too long so I just stopped completely. Felt no cravings, but had some withdrawal symptoms (light headedness, sore throat, kinda tingly feeling in hands/feet).

Hopefully I can keep this up, I definitely miss the post-work smoke and the socializing part of smoking, but what can you do. Not dying of cancer is better, I think.

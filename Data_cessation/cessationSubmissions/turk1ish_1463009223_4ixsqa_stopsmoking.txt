Day one

I remember when i started smoking. It was 3 years ago. I was 19 years old and freshly out of my home town. Maybe it was loneliness, maybe it was sadness, maybe both.

I don't remember why i quit for the first time. I remember it happened though (reason i remember is because i hooked up with somebody and blamed the bad sex on quitting smoking.)

I remember why i started again. It was a girl. She was stressing me out. I started again. We ended up dating. She convinced me to quit again. I did.

We broke up. I started smoking again.

The next time i quit was when my parents came to visit me for thanksgiving. I had enough and just quit.

I forget why i started again.

I quit again at least 2 times between now and then. About 2 months ago i had quit. Then i started for a week but quickly stopped.

Then i moved. I left everything behind and decided to become someone new.

3 hours after i landed, i bought my first pack.

I've been here for almost a month now. I work in a kitchen and all my co workers smoke. Today was one of the hardest days I've ever worked.

But it was worth it. And tomorrow will be worth it. So will the next day.

I met a really nice girl. She's allergic to cigarettes, which means she's literally allergic to me. She really likes me (i think) and i really like her.

I just remember kissing her and she started coughing. That was one of the things that made my decision.

The rest is that I'm just done smoking. Its not me anymore.

Sorry about the strange post. My head has been spinning all day

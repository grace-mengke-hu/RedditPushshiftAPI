I don't want to quit, but I want to quit. Make sense?

Earlier tonight part of my molar broke off - clearly just weak with age. However, I took a good look at my teeth. There seems to be so much staining going on towards the back of my mouth that I am repulsed by myself, and bluntly quite upset by it. Even though it isn't too noticable when I smile, its definitely dealt a blow to my confidence.

It's clearly time to quit smoking. I want to for health reasons, but mentally I don't want to - I'm not ready - which is obviously just an excuse. How the fuck do I just do this?

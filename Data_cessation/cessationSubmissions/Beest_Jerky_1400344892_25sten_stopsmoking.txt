Nicotine patch causing arm cramping

I'm giving quitting another shot, but this go around I've been experiencing painful cramping running all the way down my arm. Doesn't happen all the time, but it is quite inconvenient as it, well, just straight up hurts like hell. It seems that using my arm to lift something makes it worse, and lifting things and using my arm on a regular basis is unavoidable seeing as how I am a mechanic. Anyone else experienced this? Should I be terribly concerned? Or is it just a harmless (in a safety sense) side effect?

Over 10 days.

This is very strange and very unique for me. I posted about a week ago ( I think ) about how I quit smoking for vaping, and it was easy. To fortify it, I also started reading Allen Carr's "EasyWay". 

Early this week, I noticed that I really didn't even need the vaporizer, and I doubt it has much nicotine coming out of it anyway, based on my research and feelings both. So I just stopped everything. Now I am knowingly forcefully controlling my urges without vice. 

Can I have one of those fancy star things on my flair now? I think this is it.

Honestly I haven't even made it to chapter 1 of EasyWay though, and I think my recent hatred of bad health is really the fuel to this fire.

I do feel urges, and I want to talk about it, that is why I am writing this. It is not "fun", but the benefits heavily outweigh the pain of ignoring occasional urges. Breathing fresh air is highly underrated! And my stomach problems have resided tremendously.

I wish I could have let the younger me understand this. But no regrets and I had a ton of fun as it was :) Now off to different types of fun.

**Edit** I just found the self-add badge thing, sent the message, nothing yet but I'll wait and see. I am looking forward to my badge :) I earned it.

Day 2 off the fags. Will using an e-cig derail me further down the line?

I'm kind of sceptical on nicotine replacement therapy. Have failed to quit before because of still being addicted to nicotine then finding myself vulnerable when drunk!
But I'm absolutely terrified of the cold turkey method and so have been puffing away on an e-cig. 
Does anyone else have any experience of giving up using an e-cig? Were you able to step down on nicotine strength then stop altogether?
I was smoking close to a pack a day for the past 8 years, and still have that deluded sense that I love smoking, being a smoker etc so still on slightly rocky ground. 
Any advice greatly appreciated - thanks

Almost 72 hours without a cig and it SUCKS

I am craving nothing more than a cig. Trying to keep myself busy but it's a constant thought in the front of my head. Pack a day smoker for 4 years and MAN THIS IS HARD. 

Edit: I have no clue the etiquette for this subreddit. Pardon me if rants like that aren't appreciated, just venting!

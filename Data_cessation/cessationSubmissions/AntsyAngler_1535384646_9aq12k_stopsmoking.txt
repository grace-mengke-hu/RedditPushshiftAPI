3 months! Oh yeah. Feels good.

I'm so happy to be 3 months nicotine, smoke, and vape free.  I've quit many times in the past, but it's been the hardest this time for some reason, and I'm determined that it's the last time so I don't have to go through this again. 

The best thing is not smelling like a smoker.  Not having to duck out from work.  Not being a social leper.  Most people despise smokers in my town, and I'd become a closet smoker, constantly worries about washing off the smell and covering it up, waiting until after work to smoke (that was torture).  I'm just glad to be free from it.  But I still miss it like hell sometimes.  Stupid addiction.  

For the new folks out there, it's worth the short term misery of quitting to get out of the trap.  It's a long fight, but worth it!

Smoking and me.

I have been a smoker for 12 years. Started when I was 17 and I am pretty sure it was September of 2003. I was young and stupid. I smoked pack a day. Smoking has been a major part of my life. I smoke after I eat. I smoke when I walk back to my car after work. I smoke when I have my morning coffee. I bond with people over smoke. Every void of life has or had been filled with smoking. 

I remember the times when smoking used to give me pleasure. It doesn't anymore. Now it is just guilt and pain. Yes, pain. Pain because I feel like my throat has soreness which gets worse when I smoke. The soreness is existent for past 1 month. Guilt has been for far longer than that. I have been telling myself for at least past 4-6 years to quit. I am 29 now and I need to take responsibility. I have done irreparable damage to my body. I can see what I have done to my teeth. I can only imaging how worse my internal organs must be. 

I need to watch for the soreness that I have in my throat. I am assuming it didn't go away because I kept smoking but if it doesn't improve in next two weeks, I would have to see a doctor. I have a wonderful life. I have a graduate degree in engineering, I make good money and my future looks bright. All this will be for nothing if I die. 

I have completed 36 hours without a cigarette. I will never smoke again. I have been seriously trying to quit for last one month. I have been reading this sub too. You guys have been great motivation. I wont give up this time. If I don't this time, cigarettes will win and I will end up with cancer or dead and I can't let that happen.

tldr; smoking for 12 years. 29 yrs old now and need to take responsibility. smoking causing throat soreness and might be worse than that. Didn't smoke for past 36 hrs and never will. Huge thanks to this sub for motivation.

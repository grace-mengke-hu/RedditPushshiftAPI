Smoked for 36 years. Had my last cigarette May 18th. Still going strong.

I started when I was 13. 36 years and numerous attempts later, I've finally gone the longest without smoking than, with the exception of Army basic training, I ever have. Six whole days.

Several things are different this time.

* My girlfriend is a non-smoker, and didn't want me to smoke. I didn't want to sneak smokes or worry about having to completely "de-smoke" myself every time I was expecting to see her. She also wants me to stick around as long as possible, because she likes me a lot. :)

* I'd gradually been getting tired of smoking. It just didn't taste or feel good anymore. It was becoming a chore, and I started hating the way it made me smell. I was tired of being a slave to it.

* I got a prescription for Chantix. I'd used it in the past to limited results. However, this time I committed to it. It really works, and my prescription is free.

* Shit's expensive, yo. Couldn't justify spending $10 on a pack of cigarettes anymore.

* Health scare. A CT scan revealed something on my lung. It turned out to be nothing, but that really got me thinking.

* My living and job situation is different. Simply put, I'm not as stressed out as I used to be. I no longer work with a group of smokers who would always convene outside to gossip and smoke during break times.

* I'm quitting while I'm ahead. I haven't had any major medical problems. I haven't gotten sick or developed a cough. I know it's only a matter of time, so I'm not pushing my luck any further.

I'm using a quitting smoking benefits timeline to see where my body is on any given day, and that's really helping me stay focused. It's been surprisingly easy this time - or at least easier than I thought it would be. If this former smoker can quit, so can you. Just keep trying.

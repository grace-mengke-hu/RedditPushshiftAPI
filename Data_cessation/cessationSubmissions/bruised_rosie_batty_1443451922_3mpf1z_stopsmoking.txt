A pack a day for 15 years. Today I am 20 months cigarette and smoke free. It is without a doubt the best thing I ever did.

I was that fucked I couldn't walk up a set of stairs without getting short of breath. My cough was wet and constant. Cigarette butts littered my car and backyard. My clothes smelled like an ashtray. It was slowly dying. I was a slave to tobacco. Where is my next packet coming from? When am I going to smoke next? Long haul flights were a nightmare. I hated waking up every morning with that constant nagging to have that first cigarette. It is a shit feeling.

In those twenty months I started running. Slowly at first. Over time my lung capacity came back. I remember the first time I went for a run after quitting. I couldn't even fucking run 200 meters without gasping for air.


Today I can run 5km in 19 minutes, 10km in 42 minutes. A half marathon in 1 hour 35. 

There is hope. Alan Carr's guide helped me. I was skeptical myself. I had to start out getting through each hour at a time without a cigarette. Then, before I knew it I was getting through days at a time then weeks.

The big thing for me was the fear. Facing the fear of living the rest of my life without my best mate Nicotine. What was I going to be like? Cigarettes had become part of my identity. Once I came to terms with the fact that I had absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain by quitting it became achievable.


And here I am. Twenty months without a cigarette or smoke of any kind.

Life is so much better without being a slave to a dried plant.

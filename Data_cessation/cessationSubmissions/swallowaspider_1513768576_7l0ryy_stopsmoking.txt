Easily into DAY 5! Want some advice?

I’m now into day 5 of not smoking! After multiple failed attempts I finally know I’ll be free this time. The important thing to remember is you’ll only be successful if you CHOOSE for YOURSELF to quit. If you’re pressured into it then at some point you might break. I’m not saying it’s impossible to give up whilst under pressure but I can tell you that it’s serious pressure on your shoulders. Happened to me during a few attempts and I just couldn’t handle it. Felt like I was constantly under scrutiny! I feel amazing and I’m fully committed to using the Smoke Free app with pro upgrade. It’s really motivating me. And also reading through posts you guys post, especially when it’s been nearly a year and you don’t even think about cigarettes anymore! I’m using NRT initially by the way, I haven’t stopped cold turkey as that’s never worked for me. The point is: give up when YOU want to give up (unless you have a serious medical problem caused by smoking which means you have no choice in the matter) and give up in the way that’s right for YOU. You can go cold turkey or use NRT (and there’s a dozen or more different types nowadays, it’s just finding out what suits you as what might work for one person may not work for another). Good luck to anyone who, like me, has began their smoke free journey. And to those that haven’t smoked for months or years, to inspire me. 😁

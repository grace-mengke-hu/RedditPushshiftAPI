5 weeks in and struggling

5 weeks clean. 1000+ cigarettes not smoked. I can feel my will power waning. I was doing SO well. So well. But the past week, all I can think about is smoking "just one cigarette." It doesn't help that my fiance still smokes and a pack sits on our back porch at all times. Yesterday, he left the house for a bit and I went outside and just stared at the pack of cigarettes and kept walking up to it and reaching my hand out to touch it. Luckily, I could smell the ashtray that was sitting beside them and it kind of made me gag. Today at work, my employee had her pack of cigarettes on her station (same brand I used to smoke) and I wanted to just swipe one so bad. I didn't, and I told her I'd been considering it, and when I walked by again she had put them away to avoid temptation.

I've been vaping but I do that less and less and it has been a tremendous help. 

Overall, I feel like Allen Carr's book rewired my brain to kind of combat these strong desires. I *know* deep down inside that I would feel awful if I smoked, both mentally and physically. I *know* it won't be "just one." And also the thought of having to reset my badge and my SmokeFree App timer just breaks my heart. 

I'm just disappointed with myself that instead of it getting easier, it seems to be getting harder. I'm so afraid I'm just going to break down and all my progress will be down the toilet. I smoked for 20 years. I don't want to start again. Why just out of nowhere, this late in the game, is my brain now working against me? I was doing so, so well and am so proud of myself.

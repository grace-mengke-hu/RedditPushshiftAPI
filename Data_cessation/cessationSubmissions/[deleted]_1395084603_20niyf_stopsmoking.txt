I start today

Well yesterday but whatever.  I'm being forced into this because of my illness which isn't much of an illness at all; it's just a common cold.  However, every time I've gotten a cold in the past, I've gotten bronchitis and eventually pneumonia.  Four years of this shit I tells ya!  Also, this is the first time I've been sick in college (impressive I know) and I do not like it. Therefore, I choose to abstain from smoking!

Day #1

I have been smoking since i was 15-16yrs old and just turn 18  in june...I promised mynself that I would have kicked the habit by 18 but have not. It has been hell for the past 10 hours, but I am not looking back and excited to be able to breathe again and not need a smoke every 45 min....very sleepy right now and irritated.

Tl;dr quit smoking today and never felt more serious about qutting

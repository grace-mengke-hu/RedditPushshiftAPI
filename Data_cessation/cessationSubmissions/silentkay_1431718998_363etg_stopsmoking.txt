What can I do on work breaks besides smoke?

I'm going to the doctor to ask for help on quitting smoking. My biggest issue is how to change my habits and smoking on my break is a huge one. Its the only reason I'm able to get a "real" break and leave the office. Any suggestions for other activities that will help me feel like I'm on a break? Anything will help!

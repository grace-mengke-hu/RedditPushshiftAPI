Keeping a pack around

Was just wondering if anyone has been successfully in keeping a pack around and feeling a sense of power over not smoking them?   I always throw mine out, but always end up buying another pack out of anxiety, and was just curious if I were to keep a pack around the house, if I’d end up smoking them or be successful in using that unsmoked pack as a source of motivation and control.  Just interested in hearing other people’s takes and successes.

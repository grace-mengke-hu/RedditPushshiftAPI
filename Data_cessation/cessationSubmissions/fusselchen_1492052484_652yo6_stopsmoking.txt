1 week down. Things are getting harder it seems

Maybe I'm just drunk and like doing stupid things but i keep thinking about how a single cig wouldn't hurt.  
I know i'll feel like shit afterwards and I know i shouldn't have it but god damn. The temptation is huge right now. No liquid for my vape anymore so that's out of the question. Maybe if i went for a light?  
I don't even want the nicotine. I just want the act of smoking if it makes sense.

Sorry that I'm just venting but eh. Guess that's what this place is made for.

Another day 3 fail

It happened again - I made it the first 2 days relatively easy (im using patches), but on the 3rd day I caved. This has happened so many times and I can't figure out why. It's like I wake up on day 3 and the desire to smoke again is overwhelming. I can't get it out of my head, I find ways to justify it, and I turn off all the reasons why I want to quit. Any advice on how to get past it? I don't want the rest of my life to be that third day.

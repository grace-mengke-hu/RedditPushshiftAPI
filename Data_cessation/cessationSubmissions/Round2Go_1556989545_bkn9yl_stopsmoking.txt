I switched from a juul (59mg/ml) to a refillable vape (35mg/ml) and it’s going well

I’m cutting down on my nicotine intake slowly to eventually quit. The first couple of days were hard. I didn’t plan on making that big of a jump but the vape shop was out of nicotine salt and I had to buy prebottled juice. I’m glad I’m doing it this way. Planning to cut back more when I run out. Slow and steady so I can manage this with my other life stressors. Anyone else have luck this way?

Unsupportive spouse

How do I deal with my unsupportive wife.  WE've been together 8 years, both smokers from before we met each other.  A week ago I happened to hear about Allen Carr and started reading.  I haven't finished reading yet, of quit entierly, but i'm down to like 2 cigs a day, from about 30.  My wife keeps telling me that I'm hurting our relationship and I'm leaving her in the dust.  Me stopping my smoking seems to be causing a lot of resent, but after jsut this short period I feel so much better....any thoughts?

TL;DR  Wife says I'm causing a rift in our relationship by quitting without her

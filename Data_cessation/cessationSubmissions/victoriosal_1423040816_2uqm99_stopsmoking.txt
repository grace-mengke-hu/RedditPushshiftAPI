My SO is A Trigger

My girlfriend and I both smoke, but I've decided to quit! I asked her if she wanted to quit with me and she said "no". She still wants to support me, however this genuinely frightens me because 1. She didn't respond the way I thought she would. It wasn't in a bad way, but it wasn't in a good way either, so I'm lost on how much she's actually going to support my endeavor, and, 2. Every time she smokes it will trigger me, plus her cigarettes will be lying around the house taunting me. I've quit before (2 years) so I know I can do it, but it was under different circumstances where I had no triggers. I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone else had to deal with a SO smoke while trying to quit? How did you deal with it?

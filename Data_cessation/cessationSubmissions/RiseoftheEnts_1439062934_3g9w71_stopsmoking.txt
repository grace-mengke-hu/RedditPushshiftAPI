Is vaping cheating?

Last Sunday I bought a vaping pen from the store and haven't smoked a cigarette since. Does this count at all as quitting? I feel like I am still smoking just without the smell and actual "smoke". Idk just thought I'd ask this sub on their opinions about it. I do plan though to keep cutting back on the nicotine each time I buy a bottle so I can kick the nicotine habit for good. I really don't want to just trade one habit for another that is in the same category and pat myself on the back thinking to myself that I've actually changed. Or maybe I'm thinking about it too much.

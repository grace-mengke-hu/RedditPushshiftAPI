Day Three: Or the importance of a MP3 Player.

[u/lifetimeofnot] (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1cofv8/anger_issues/) has a great post today about anger and being surrounded by idiots. I forgot my iPod this morning and so had to resort to the radio on my commute, 40 odd miles. I have managed to break two really bad habits in my life. First, I used to bite my nails; ho hum. Second, I was a  political / NPR junky (I had to quit this for ideological reasons). I have an aversion to adverts so am restricted to public radio stations; the only non-talk station worth listening to, does not reach out to where I work, so I was restricted Morning Edition. This is where it sounds really bad fortunately the Boston manhunt is going on. This meant that the news was restricted to one subject and I could only be pissed off at the repetition and inanity of the reporting. Thankfully the same was true on the reverse commute.

So the moral of the story is twofold:
1) If at all possible control your environment.
2) If you can't, this too shall pass.

P.S. When I got back in range of the decent radio station, they are having an all day Stones on vinyl day (you can hear the pops and crackles), doesn't get any better than that.

PPS. Drink may have been consumed before making this post. I know that it is early my time for this, but gin and Jagger makes it easier for me.

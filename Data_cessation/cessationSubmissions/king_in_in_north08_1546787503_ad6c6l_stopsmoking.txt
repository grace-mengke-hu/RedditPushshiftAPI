Do mini nicotine lozenges dissolve faster?

I have quit cigarettes for 2 weeks now, using 2mg nicotine gum. When I ran out,     I decided to try 2mg nicotine lozenge. I have to really work them in my mouth to make them dissolve within an hour. This leads to stomach ache from swallowing nicotine.

Do mini nicotine lozenges dissolve faster? and are they available in 2mg strength?

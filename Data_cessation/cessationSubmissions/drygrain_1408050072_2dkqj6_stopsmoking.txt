Five days and still periodic cravings, help?

I spontaneously quit 5 days ago and have had since then a few moments every day when I just have an intense urge to smoke. I understand my triggers and how addiction works (ex heroin addict), so I'm mostly prepared for it when I'm driving, after meals, drinking, etc. When I see it coming I can deal with it. But when it's just a random craving out of the blue, what can I do about it? Any kind of mantras you used? Other activities?

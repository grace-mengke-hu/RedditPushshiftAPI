Here we go again

hello stop smoking I've been reading on here for a little while but first time poster here. i read the easy way and made it a week smoke free then i got drunk and started smoking again. just rewatched the youtube video and im going to try again and stay booze free for a bit. the thousandth time is the charm right? nine years of smoking and i am ready to quit for good this time. smoked about a half a pack plus and a tin of dip a day. just posting here for a little accountability for myself.

Just a small update. Nothing big.

I DID IT! Smoke free for 3 YEARS BABY! One of the best decisions I've made. Most of the time it's great, almost like I've never smoked. Every now and then the urge creeps up but it's easy to ignore. Just gotta remember to stay strong. You guys were there at the beginning on my journey to quit and were probably responsible for a lot of it. I'd love to return the favor! Pm me if you need encouragement. You can do it.

I quit.

Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I've just extinguished my last cigarette, and in doing so have become a non-smoker.

This is not my first quit, and my relapse story is far from original: After 3 years, one cigarette quickly led to a pack-and-a-half a day in no- time at all.

I hate the slavery of cigarettes, what they do to my health, and the confidence and self-respect they rob me of.

I'm so glad to be free and to be here with all of you.

&amp;#x200B;

I will check back in tomorrow morning and take the pledge not to smoke. We can do this!

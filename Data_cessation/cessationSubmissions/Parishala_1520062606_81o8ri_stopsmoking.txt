2M 23D

Just got home from the bar.  The only bar in my town with pool tables allows smoking inside.  At first it smelled like shit.  3 beers and 2 games in and oh my god that shit smelled so good.   I almost broke tonight.  A good friend kept me from smoking.  Thank you Sam.  Gonna cry myself to sleep now...

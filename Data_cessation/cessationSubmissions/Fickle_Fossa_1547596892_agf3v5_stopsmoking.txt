Had my last cigarette on Friday and just found this sub! Hoping it can help me finally quit this disgusting habit!

I've tried before and got a few days in, always let my triggers get the better of me though. Feel like I've definitely had enough this time so I'm here, and I've subbed and messaged the badge bot so I can try to keep myself accountable.

Fingers crossed this time!

It is time...

I "quit" for six months out of the year in 2013 and 2012, then started smoking again a few months ago while on holiday, which is the same reason I started again in 2012.  Thing is, both times I was smoking while drinking and socializing and didn't have any issues.  I would go out, drink smoke and dance the night away and not have any desire to smoke again in the morning.  Until I was on holiday's and was partying every day, so I would smoke everyday... But this has to stop.  I realize I was just setting myself up for inevitable failure both previous quits.  

So now, cold turkey.  No excuses.  No exceptions.  15 years of this self mutilation is enough.

Anyone else here attempted quitting more times than they can count?

There were even times when I said "that's it!", threw everything out, and 1 hour later bought a new pack again. Sometimes this process would even repeat itself several times a week.

I once quit for about a year, but sometimes I lose hope that I'll ever achieve a state where I don't crave cigarettes again.

And yes, I've read Allen Carrs books. Plural. There are two of them. I know them by heart now.

Today I stop letting smoking control my life.

I've started smoking at 17 and I'm going to be 27 soon and I don't want to be a ten year smoker. I'm sick of smelling like ass and my mouth tasting horrible all the time. I hate coughing up junk every morning and not being able to run for more than 5 minutes. This is all probably cliche and shit by now, but it's how I feel. I don't want to smoke anymore and I know it will be hard for a little while, but I will make it. I've been following this sub for a couple weeks while getting mentally prepared for what's coming. Wish me luck.

I haven't had a cigarette since jan 7th 2013, and I'm using an e-cig.

This has been the easiest time I've had quitting smoking and I've been using an e-cig. I'm still dependent on nicotine, but not getting all the additional health hazards as I would with a real tobacco cigarette. I wanted to suggest this to people that are severely struggling to break the habbit/addiction. One of my co-workers at a previous job did a lot of research into the e-cig products and found a very reliable and safe product to use that I find to be extremely inexpensive in the long run. 

If you have the strength and will power to quit with out any assistance more power to you. But i know my self personally and I loved smoking and needed an alternative. With out turning this into an advertisement if any one is interested in the brand PM me and I'll let you know.

With in these 6 days, my lungs are beginning to kick out 15 years worth of abuse, I've got a sense of smell back, my toes and fingers stopped going numb. After doing the number crunching, after the initial purchase I'll be spending between $20 to $30 a month compared to $300 to support my addiction. And I do plan on tapering down the overall nicotine intake.

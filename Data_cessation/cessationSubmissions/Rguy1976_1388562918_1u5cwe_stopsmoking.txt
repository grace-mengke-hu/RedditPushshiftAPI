Well... Here I go...

This will be the first time I've tried to quit smoking in about 2 years.  Last time I quit was for 2 years...  Then I ran into a friend and lit up...  Duh!  The time before was for 1.5 years...  Then I broke my hand...  And lit up...  I really don't care for the cigarettes.  And I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything by quitting (quite the contrary actually!) I just crushed my leftovers in my pack.  Decimated them actually so there's no chance of reassembly...  and soaked them with water to be sure...  I submit myself fully to the accountability of this Subreddit.  Please back me as I do this friends!

Im quitting tomorrow.

I've been smoking for 9 years and I've tried to quit many time using gum, patches, etc. This time I'm going cold turkey. Does drinking lots of water and eating candy actually help? Also, what do you do when you're  really stressed? 

I've also downloaded the QuitNow app so I'm hoping that keeps me on track. 

Thanks!

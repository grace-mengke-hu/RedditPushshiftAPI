Does this make sense?

Say for example, someone sleep is screwed up and also the person is stress because of not getting enough oxygen from carbon monoxide, then does it makes sense that quitting smoking would cause weight lose because cortisol levels go down because they are less stressed from better sleep  and less stressed from no more carbon monoxide from cigarettes?

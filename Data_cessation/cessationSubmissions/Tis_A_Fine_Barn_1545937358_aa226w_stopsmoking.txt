I randomly found a lighter today in the bottom of a bag of old tea stuff. Must have put it there years ago. I'm guessing that now that I'm a non-smoker all my years of disappearing lighters as a smoker are going to find their way back to me. I threw it away. Presenting #042 Golbat. See you tomorrow.

Happiness is ?

Happiness is when you come here to check how many days it has been since you quit.
For the past three days, I have not thought about smoking or told myself how many days since I have quit. Its like it never was a part of my life.
And then today, I could not recollect the number of days.
So I come here and take a proud look at my badge. I would not smoke again only to lose my precious badge.

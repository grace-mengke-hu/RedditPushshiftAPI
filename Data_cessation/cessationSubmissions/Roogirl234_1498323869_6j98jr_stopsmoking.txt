Found a pack while cleaning yesterday

Day 27 into my CT quit, I found a full un opened pack, I looked at it and thought the old me would be soooo happy! I decided to open it and one by one I ripped them up and gave reasons WHY I quit. it was liberating! I also deleted all of my exes texts.. he's been very snoopy lately and wanting to know what's going on.. Its interesting to realize all the red flags and how toxic my life WAS. I'm also alcohol free and its been amazing. I think once you truly start loving yourself the possibilities are endless. I'm starting to workout and feel pretty again, I've distanced myself from old friends, knowing I would relapse. I give myself a couple more weeks to be mentally strong to handle any situation. finding new friends isn't easy but will be helpful. Its only almost a month to my quit but I'm FUCKING PROUD OF MYSELF!! thank you all for words of encouragement, couldn't have made it this far without you all!!! much love:)

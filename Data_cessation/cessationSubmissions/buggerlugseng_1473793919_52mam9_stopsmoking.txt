Wanting to quit help!

I've been trying to quit (unsuccessfully) for 2 years I'm a 26 m who's smoked since he was 15/16.  
I have always been active with work and I play sport in my spare time and have always been one of the fitter ones despite smoking. Recently I have found myself lighting up out of habit and not because I want one. I always think tomorrow I will quit then have another dreaded one and I keep going. 

I'm scared of quitting as I think my fitness will drop but I want to quit as my fianc√© hates me smoking, I hate smoking! And I know the health benefits are there at the end but I live each day as it comes. I run my own company which stresses me out and then I smoke, I get in my car -I smoke, I get bored - I smoke   It's driving me nuts! I've tried nrt - didn't work (and I don't get on well with patches, red arm for a week), Alan Carr twice  I'm at my wits end.  

Sorry for the long post I need to get it out of my system.

40 days!

40 days and ZERO nicotine!! I used to dip a can of chewing tobacco every goddamn day for five effing years. 40 days in and most of the time I forget I ever used the stuff. I can play pick up basketball without getting winded. I can take a shit without needing nicotine. I can live my effing life on my own effing terms. This is awesome.

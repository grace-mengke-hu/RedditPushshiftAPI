Day one - let’s go!!!

First of all, thank you all for being there, supporting and sharing your wins and defeats.

I’m 39 and started at 18 yo, and I’ve smoked a pack of 20 cigs a day.

I never tried to stop, but I guess it’s time. 

Yesterday I smoked 4 cigs and, at the end of the day decided that it was it.

I’m using phase 1 patches (21 mg) and, until now, it’s going better than I thought - of course I’m missing something, but nothing too unbearable.  It’s going to be worst, I know... :)

Again, thank you for being there, listening and showing that is possible to be a better and healthier person!

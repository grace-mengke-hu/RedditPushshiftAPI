I haven't smoked for a long time, but today I'm stopping before I'm truly a slave to the nicotine

I'm 24 years old and I started smoking about 8 months ago. 

I never thought I'd get addicted, but I can say that I am at least partially. "Smoking won't be as bad if I smoke natural. Oh I'll only smoke in my car. Boy this helps my stress and anxiety levels." What a load of absolute bullshit. I was in a slump and used that as a crutch to pick myself up. I was only lying to myself. Bought a pack of American Spirits cause I figured it would be better than other brands. Lol. I can only laugh at myself. Fuck this coughing I do everyday. Fuck smoking despite knowing I have a slight heart condition. I haven't smoked for almost 24 hours and I plan to turn those hours into days. Into months. Into years. 

I know this isn't much compared to stopping after smoking for 25 years or something, but I need to stop even if it's only 4 cigs a day back that can easily turn into 1 or 2 packs. I have my whole life ahead of me and smelling like smoke all the time is disgusting, not to mention the fear of a heart attack in the back of your mind.

Stop my brothers and sisters before it's too late.

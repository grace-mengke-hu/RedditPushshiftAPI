Well I had to reset my badge...

I managed to quit and stay quit for about 50 days. I was so proud of myself and yesterday, I decided to smoke and I totally regret it. I am completely disappointed in myself now. I really thought I could quit. I guess since it is still really fresh in my mind, I am just feeling really lost right now. I don't know if I can do this. I really admire how some people can just quit smoking easier than I can. I wish I had stronger willpower.

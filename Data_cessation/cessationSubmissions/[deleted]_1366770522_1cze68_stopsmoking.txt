Over a year, yea for me

* I still want to smoke every day
* Quitting cold turkey is a personal choice, quit at your own pace
* Smoking one once in a while after too many beers is OK, just don't make a habit of that
* Find a reason to quit. For me: new puppies, dad's dying due to smoking, not wanting to cough every morning
* Keep this sub-reddit on your list to remind you why you quit
* Good luck everyone, I wish you all years of no money spent on cigs and a life free of coughing
* I smoked for 20 years

so it's finally happened

So i not long got home from work.It has been a hard day and i also now face a life changing decision regarding my career, so very stressed about that. I sat down to play my xbox for a bit but then it hit me. I stood up and grabbed a cigarette(there are smokers in my house) i went outside and lit up. I got halfway through and i could feel my heart racing, it tasted terrible and i began to shake. I threw it away and felt disgusted, it did nothing for me. I have been feeling great not smoking, and i feel great now. I started smoking when i was 12 years old and never imagined life without it until now. I think it's finally happened. I have beaten it.

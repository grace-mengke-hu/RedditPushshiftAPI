8 Blow pops and a bag of sunflower seeds

It's like day 4 for me. The first 3 were great. Not too bad and I'm like, OH YEAH, I so got this. Today, I can't keep anything out of my mouth. I want to sob for no reason and I am going through suckers and sunflower seeds like nuts (<--ha)
I'm ready to quit, though, and know if I get through today, I can get through tomorrow, so on and so forth. I quit for many reasons but one that really stood out to me was that I was sick of being the one standing outside alone to smoke. Almost no one I know smokes anymore. So standing outside alone, smoking on my cigarette, really made it hit home for me how ridiculous it was. 

So here I am. Maybe I'm just ranting because well, it keeps me from stuffing anything else into my mouth. 

Good thing, though. I'm so busy keeping my mouth busy, I haven't yelled at anyone once since I quit. That's a new one.

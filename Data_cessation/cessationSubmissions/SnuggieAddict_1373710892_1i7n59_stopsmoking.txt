How did you friends react to your quit (rant post!)?

So, Tell me about the silliest, most annoying replies and questions about your smoking cessation.

- I could never do it! I like smoking! (I don't get what's there to like).
- I quit smoking for 3 years, but I had to smoke just one to see I'm not an addict anymore (...what?)
- I quit smoking but then my boyfriend left me, and I had to start again (How will that get him back?)
- Still holding on with your no smoking thing? (What about you? still smelling like an ashtray?)

and my favorite one:
- How do you manage living with a smoker?  (My husband smokes).
The funny part is that they usually ask this while holding a ciggarette up to my face. I don't mind living with a smoker, since he respects and supports my new lifestyle, but they don't seem to get it.

come on! rant away!

A random way that quitting smoking has continued to help me be healthier

I have recently begun working on losing weight and getting healthier that way.  The other day I was reading some other people's comments about handling food cravings and I thought about how I haven't really had any issues with food cravings (re-learning portion control, healthier cooking options and getting off the damn couch, yes, but food cravings, not really).  Then I realized it is possibly due to the fact that quitting smoking involved getting really good at managing/ignoring cravings!  So, yet another health benefit to quitting!

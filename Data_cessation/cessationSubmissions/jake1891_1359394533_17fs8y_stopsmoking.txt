i need help quitting

I've been a smoker for 15 years. I am 31 years old. I've tried to quit countless times. I've tried the gum, the patch, The Easy Way book. Basically everything but Chantix, which I have no interest in trying. I desperetely want to quit but at this point I feel like something is wrong with me. I will buy pack, smoke 2 cigarettes, and throw them away in rage, only to buy another pack a few hours later. I have flucutaed over the years but now I am about a pack a day, give or take. 

Has anyone else ever felt basically hopeless, even before they started? Thanks for any ideas.

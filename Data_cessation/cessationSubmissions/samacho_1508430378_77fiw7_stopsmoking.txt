Another Day One

Just posting here as a kind of bookmark. And a sort of accountability thing. I've been smoking for about five years. I smoke half a pack a day. Buying my first pack of cigs was possibly the stupidest decision of my life so far so I'm trying to get out before I feel like I can't. 

I've tried quitting a few times, but I've never let a few thousand people know about it. So maybe this'll help it stick. :)

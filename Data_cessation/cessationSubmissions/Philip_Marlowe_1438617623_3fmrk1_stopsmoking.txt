A downside to quitting I noticed this weekend.

I went to a camping music festival this weekend in Iowa. Ordinarily spending that much time outside, under the influence of various substances, and using porta-potties that have been boiling in 95 degree heat all weekend would have led me to smoke at least three packs of cigarettes. I'm pleased to note, however, that I made it through the whole weekend without smoking! 

That said... Holy fuck, festivals smell terrible. Eugh. I can't get over how much stronger my sense of smell has become in the last two months. Dumpsters, homeless people, diesel fumes... I used to be totally desensitized to the scent because of smoking. Not anymore. Yeesh! Gotta take the good with the bad, I guess.

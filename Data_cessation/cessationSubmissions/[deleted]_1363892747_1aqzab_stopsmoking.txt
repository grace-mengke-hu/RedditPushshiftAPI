100 Days!! Know that all the pain right now is worth it!

[I know, my badge says 99, but I'm really at 100.] Hey everyone--wanted to share some insights that I've gained after 100 days of smoking. The first insight is this... when you think you are out of the woods, you aren't! This is my second quit; on my first, I made it 70 days or so and then started with the, "maybe just one" bullshit, and sure enough I was back to half a pack a day in no time. I've used nicotine patches each time; I totally understand people's rationale for going cold turkey, but patches were convenient for me and allowed me to quit exactly when I needed to. They also gave me the time to reflect on my habit before going through withdrawals. 

Note: I haven't read (in its entirety) EASY WAY, but I recommend it to people anyway because I've seen it help so many people on this board. If you're struggling, it can't hurt spending an afternoon reading through it. 

But yeah. At 100 days I still don't feel completely done with this battle--I still get stray cravings especially on bad days, but I've been through enough to know that having a cigarette will NOT make me feel the way I want to feel... it's a farce!! 

Not smoking for so long has left me with a huge feeling of... normalcy. My room DOESN'T smell like cigarettes. My teeth AREN'T yellow and getting yellower. My bank account ISN'T being drained $10 a day for cigs. My lungs AREN'T getting blacker. I can walk and run and exercise WITHOUT getting winded. My voice ISN'T raspy. And best of all, I'm NOT turning my non-smoker SO into a smoker (which was happening for a while). 

It's all worth it. Plus the lessons learned quitting smoking apply to almost everywhere else in life. YOU CAN DO EEET

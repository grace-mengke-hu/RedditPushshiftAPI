2 weeks in and feeling argumentative and having "negative thoughts". Is this normal?

I'm two weeks with out cigarettes tomorrow and my cravings have been getting worse (first week was a breeze). I constantly argue with people in my head (even arguments from years ago), easily frustrated, any advice on overcoming this? And did anyone else experience something like this?

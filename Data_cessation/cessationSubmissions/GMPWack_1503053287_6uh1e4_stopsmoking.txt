Let's try this again......

I can't believe that I am trying again. This time, I have a cold, I feel like shit and I really don't want to smoke. I tried smoking when I was slightly congested, and if felt absolutely disgusting!! I have tried to quit on several occasions, but had problems controlling my rage, especially at work, but now, I think I can deal. Hooray for the start of day 1!

Edit: I just messaged the badge bot to update my quitdate......

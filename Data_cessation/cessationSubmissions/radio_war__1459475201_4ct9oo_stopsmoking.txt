7 Days

Its been 7 Days since my last smoke. And Goddam I went out with a bang. It was a party, I drunk to much, and smoked way more. But it was ok, It was a going away party for a dear old friend, who has been with me on my best days and my worst. Then again, you were pretty much a dick the whole time. Goodbye smokes.

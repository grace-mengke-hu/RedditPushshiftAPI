My fresh start

It's early evening time now, had my last cig about an hour ago. It really needs to be my last. I've had a terrible sinus infection and it just won't clear up, smoking is just draining me. 

I've tried so many times but always just make excuses in order for me to run into the shop and get a pack. Keep telling myself, ok, definitely after this weekend, Monday morning definitely! I've read changing daily habits helps so I've spoken to family & co workers that I intend to quit, because I know I cannot do this alone.

Writing this down really feels like I'm committing this time. I want my health back, I don't want to be like all the other smokers I see hanging around places burning through their health and money just to inhale smoke. It's so stupid yet I do it every day! Why??? Sorry I'm rambling, I'll go get started on my new life. 


If you're reading this and have fell off the wagon, join me. Not tomorrow, not first thing Monday. Rip whatever cigs you have in half, throw away any lighters and start inhaling fresh air. Time to live :)

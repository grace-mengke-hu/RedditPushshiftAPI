6th attempt to start to quit within 13 months

hey co-sufferers,

just wanted to point out that thank to my flu i start again to quit nicotine. 

my last (failed) attempt 2 months ago started with a flu, crazy huh? it ended when i went to club (\~3weeks after that), and had to wait to get into it. i saw people smoking and immediatley asked so. to give me a cigarette...next day i sucked my e-cigarette like i never did anything else.

it seems that everything repeats, only seasons change. there are so much triggers out there that it will become a tough fight again and hope it will be the last.

with my hurting throat i wish u all the best to win the fight over demon nicotine

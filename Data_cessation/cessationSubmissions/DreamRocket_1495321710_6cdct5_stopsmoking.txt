Advice on quitting around smoke.

I have the desire to quit after this pack, but I know I am going to be surrounded by people who smoke for the next couple of days (Monday and Tuesday) whereas after Wednesday, I normally won't be. I would like to hear what this community has to say on whether I should stop procrastinating and start now, or if it might be better for me to just wait til Wednesday.
Thanks in advance!

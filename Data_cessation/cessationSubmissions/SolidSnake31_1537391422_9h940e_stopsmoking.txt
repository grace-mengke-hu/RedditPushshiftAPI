27 months without Smoking. Still having dreams about smoking.

It's so frustrating. I don't really get any craving to smoke anymore. Once in a while I do feel a passing fancy to smoke, but it's easy to brush off, not really a craving. But maybe every other week or so, I get a dream where I smoke. I feel the guilt while I'm dreaming, but I also feel the pleasure of smoking. It's just so frustrating to still have those dreams. Luckily, the dreams doesn't give me any craving to smoke once I wake up. I'm just so afraid of relapsing because it was so hard to kick the habit.

2 Days smoke tree, might as well as die

So I stopped smoking on the 2nd. Had an exam so didn't sleep that night and couldn't sleep on the 3rd as well. Also my semester is coming to an end so was feeling depressed. Felt like crying and  felling so stressed but atleast I'm not sucking on those cancer sticks.
This is my 4th attempt, 7 months smoking.
All my failure in quitting happened after 4-5 days, when I felt good and thought " You have survived a week without smoking, this is not that hard, might as well have some smoke"
But this time it's not just about smoking. I will change my sleep cycle, studing habits, gaming addiction and will be awesome at the end of the year!
Goodluck everyone, you don't need this.

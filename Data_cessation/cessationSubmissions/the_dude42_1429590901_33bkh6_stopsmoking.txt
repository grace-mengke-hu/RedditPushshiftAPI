long time lurker, confession time

hello fellow quitters,

so i had been smoking for more than a decade and have tried to quite more than a dozen times. i started running a few weeks ago and have recently had the same recurring thought, "you are now a vegan, graduate student in a discipline you love, a runner and working towards a new life of fitness - but you are still a smoker." of all the things i have managed to change in my life in the nearly five months of graduate school, the last thing i have left is to become an ex smoker. so today i bought a pack of the cheapest smokes that i could find and smoked as many as i could, and it was disgusting. i'm going to use that memory every time i want to smoke again. i put a sign up on my door encouraging myself to run every day, and i ran for eleven days in a row and stopped only to let my body recover.

my new sign says "no more cancerettes, 4/21/15." at the bottom, it says "ultimate person." all i have left to do to become the person that i want to be is to quit smoking. i will lose the weight if i keep running. i will continue to feel like an ethical person for not consuming the labor or suffering of non-human animals. if i can just not smoke any more, then i can finally be the person i want to be.

i hope this post doesn't come off as preachy. i'm not the type of vegan who tries to cram it down the throat of anyone. all i am trying to say is that it is really hard, and if i can give up cheese and eggs, i'm sure i can give up cancerettes. as kimmy schmidt says, "you can handle anything for ten seconds at a time. one, two... three...."

Can't take it anymore.

I've lied to my friends and family. 
I had my first chance to pipe down a girl and I turned it away, because I know I wouldn't last 2 minutes without gassing out. I want to bulk up and really change my physical well-being. Im surrounded in a neighborhood filled with smokers, alcoholics and other drug users. Same goes for work. Im also behind on my bills. 

There are so many problems in my life and deep down I know if I quit smoking I would get my self-respect and sense of direction back.

I'm 21 and I was smoking since 18.  I weigh 125lbs and I would rather have a cigarette than eat.

I really want someone to talk to me and tell me their experiences with quitting and what amazing things came after.

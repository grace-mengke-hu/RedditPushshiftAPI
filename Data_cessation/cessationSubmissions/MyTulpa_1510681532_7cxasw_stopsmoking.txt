Quit date is Thursday after work (5:00pm). I'm actually pretty scared.

Can't say I've had the most confidence in myself this year.  Believing in myself to not have another cigarette seems to be asking alot, but fuck it... i'll try.  

I really am in an uncharted territory right now; I've been smoking a pack a day for 8 years.  It was never supposed to get this out of hand.  I consider myself introverted, and a smoke was always an escape away from the crowds. 

I'm mostly worried about work, what those 5 min breaks mean to me, and how I'm going to keep my composure at my work desk.

I'm not entirely sure how i'm going to tackle the cravings.

It should be noted that my quit date is in two days because that's when i calculate i'll be out of cigarettes.  Not sure if that was a healthy decision.

Anyways...any words of encouragement or advice would be deeply appreciated.

thanks for reading /r/stopsmoking.

Smoking to relieve stress in place of antidepressants

Hey guys I've been smoking on and off for the past 6 months in place of antidepressants (have had a long history of anxiety). The longest I've gone without a smoke in this period is about three weeks. I want to quit but sometimes feel that strong urge to smoke. The thing is I actually like smoking better than the meds. The meds made me tired all the time. I'm an avid runner and exercise is my healthy vice. But alas, I can't exercise all the time. I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions or "healthy vices".

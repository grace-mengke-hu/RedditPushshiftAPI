Sleepproblems and drinking with going cold turkey.

As the title says, I did a cold turkey last sunday night which makes me ~50 hours clean atm. It goes very well. I seriously had no preperations beside that my ciggarettes were empty. Still I only have some craves but in the total it's such an positive experience (such as smelling again, wow I missed that).

Only got two problems: 
1. Sleep problems: when i go to sleep got a crave and a lot of over thinking how I manage to not smoke. What's the best way to get a good sleep again? 

2. When I drink alcohol, I smoke so much more (a pack in a night is normal, 2 sometimes too). How am I going to handle this the next friday/saturday night? I am a social drinker but I go out every saturday. Giving up om the alcohol this week or weeks would be an option but I prefwr not to. Second option is vaping with 0mg nicotine. Any idea's?

Thanks in advance! (sorry for bad English)

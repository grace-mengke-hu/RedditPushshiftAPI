It's been a good journey, and its important to recognise that urges can come even far into the process

Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old who was smoking since I was 13. I quit smoking properly about 6 months ago, as my badge reads.
It was tough at the start but after a while, the cravings seemed to completely disappear. I think this was largely helped by my new exercise routines.
However, for the past few days, especially while seeing friends smoking I've been getting some cravings again and am strangely less disgusted by the thought of smoking than I have been for a while. I'm just making this post to tell everyone to stay strong and that I will get through it. It's important to recognise when you feel a craving because it's the truth. After acknowledging your desire you can gain a greater control over it. If you're really struggling hard, you can even help yourself by simply procrastinating smoking. Say, well this urge is fleeting so I'll not smoke now, but see how I feel throughout the next few days. After it passes, usually within an hour, you'll regain clarity of mind and can reaffirm yourself with all the reasons you quit. I don't have a constant phlegm cough anymore. I can run far better. My clothes and breath smell good.
Keep at it guys, I know I will!

Advice Pleas

Hi all, I'm two days in to my not smoking. So far so good, and I've found the patch to be very helpful especially for the withdrawal effects. I've semi successfully quit in the past, gradually going through to no patches.

The hardest part of this journey is with my girlfriend/partner. She is a smoker and it is not about to quit herself. Tonight I'm going to spend the night with her and the temptation will be there right in front of me. I don't want her to not smoke in front of me, however I also don't want to start up because it's right there in  front of me.

Any advice to help me get through this?

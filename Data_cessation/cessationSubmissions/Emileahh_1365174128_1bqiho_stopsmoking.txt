My boyfriend and I have wanted to quit for awhile..

My boyfriend and I have had a pretty strong relationship, we're tight, together all the time. We want to quit smoking, for the health benefits and to save money. Tried once, but the fights we picked with each other over little things always turned to blowouts, more yelling and general upset-ness than was appropriate, or necessary, and worse than they would be normally. It kind of scared us off, honestly.

My question to you guys is: how can we both quit smoking at once, and deal with the irritability and mood-swingy-ness that comes with it without taking it out on each other?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

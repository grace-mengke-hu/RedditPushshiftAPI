Question..

So, I quit smoking 3 weeks ago and have been going strong. The only time I have cravings now is when I get drunk but I've managed to deal with it. As a daily thing I'll usually take 20-30 minutes out of the day to do research on smoking and watch nasty vids that make me feel good about quitting. We've all seen the healthy lungs and the smokers lungs, but I can't find images anywhere of a former smoker, say someone who smoked for years but quit years ago. I want to be able to see how much the lungs heal. Does anyone have any idea where to find this?

And so it begins.

I've toyed with this idea for a very long time. Sometimes I last a few days, sometimes a few months, but today is the day. It's going to be though but I'm ready. I've cut down to less than five cigs a day and I think I'm going to make it. It took me a while to get into this state of no turning back, but it's over now. My bed thoughts go out to you, fellow quitters, to those that are on the fence, and to those that quit today just like me. It's going to be a long journey, but we're going to make it. And, like a fellow redditor pointed out, don't lose twice. Minor mistakes mean nothing in the long run.

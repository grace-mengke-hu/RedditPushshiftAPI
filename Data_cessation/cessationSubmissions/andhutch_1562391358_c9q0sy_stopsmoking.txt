Begin

Tonight, after nearly 7 years of smoking at currently nearly two packs a day, I had what I plan to be my last cigarette. I came to realize, it's never going to be a "good time to quit", there's always gonna be a reason to stay where I am, so I should just stop now and get it over with. 

Gonna be super hard (no vape, no NRT, cold turkey), but it's something I need to do. This time, I'm gonna win.

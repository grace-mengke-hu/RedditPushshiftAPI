can I stop drinking and smoking at the same time?

 mostly because of money and not my health, haha, but it's time. I've been a smoker for a year now and I miss being able to breath deeply and all that stuff. 


 I smoke between 5 and 15 a day, more if I'm drinking. I'm currently trying to quit drinking because apparently it is a problem. 

Anyway. Is it a good idea to quit two addictions at once? 

Thanks

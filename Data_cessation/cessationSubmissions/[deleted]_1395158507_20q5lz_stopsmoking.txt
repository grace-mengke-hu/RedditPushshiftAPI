Today is two weeks. Unfortunately the rage re-surfaced on Sunday. Is that normal?

Went through the normal rage mode during the first 5-6 days, then it seemed to calm down. Now at day 14 I am wanting to fight every person who makes eye contact with me again. Is this normal? Is there a biological reason for this?

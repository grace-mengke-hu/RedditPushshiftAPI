Question for all you ex-smokers out there

I quit cold turkey a few days shy of four months ago. I'm nearing 30 and i've been smoking for around 9 years. 

A few weeks in, I had some discomfort (not really pain, just pressure) around my left shoulder blade. It was there for a day and went away.

A few weeks later, the discomfort came back and its been with me for around two months now. The discomfort is only really noticeable when i'm slouching and it seems to go away if I have a bowel movement. But I haven't had very many of those lately.

I went to a doctor who kind of blew it off. So i've been reading articles and came across one where people were talking about having the same problems after quitting smoking. I've been living with a lot of stress over the past few months, and I used to smoke a cigarette after I ate anything (or any time I was stressed out).

Is this a normal complication? Has anyone else gone through this? It's really impacting my life and i've been thinking more and more about grabbing a pack just to see if this goes away. I had a good reason to drop the cigarettes and it was easy for me to quit because of it. I don't know if i've got it in me to quit again.



***EDIT

Just to be clear on this post, i'm concerned about a digestive issue that seems to be contributing to a pressure around my left shoulder blade. I'm not saying it is related to smoking, just exploring the possibility that no longer having cigarettes may have something to do with it. I smoked after every meal and cigarettes were something I used to relax. When I bring these issues up with people I know who have been off cigarettes for some time they tell me it has nothing to do with it. Yet when looking it up I find posts scattered all over of people complaining about the same things when quitting.

I can live with it if I know what's going on. But guessing at what it is while i'm told "don't worry about it, it's probably just stress" isn't working for me.

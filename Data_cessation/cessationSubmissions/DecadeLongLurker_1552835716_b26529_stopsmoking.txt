Caught the whiff of a freshly lit Marlboro yesterday

The smell of others don't really bother me that much but this, lol, it drove me crazy for 12 hours. I actually felt depressed because I couldn't have one. That was a first and a rather unpleasant feeling. Woke this morning and all was well thankfully. 

I guess that's normal.

Having Trouble...

Last year I quit for about 4-5 months, then started up again. I've been smoking 8-12 months now. Trying to quit again, last time I did it cold turkey. This time I am using an electric cigarette to try and substitute a cigarette. I'm about to go to bed on day 2 here, the cravings are ridiculous. It's literally all I can think about. I've been eating a shit load and using this e-cig a ton. Any tips on what to distract me with or some remedies? I am DYING here lol.

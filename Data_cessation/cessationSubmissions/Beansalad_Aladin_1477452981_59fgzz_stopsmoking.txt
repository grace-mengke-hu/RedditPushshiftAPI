Day 1

About to turn 30, and have been smoking since I was 15. 

I understand the health consequences, the effect on the teeth, the inconvenience and the smell all too well. My mother quit when she was 30 and I guess I have always had that in my mind.

At the end of the day I need to exercise more self control in my life and figured this would be a solid test. I am going through some pretty heavy cravings but that's to be expected.

I have tried to quit before, but this is the only time I have done it for reasons of betterment, not from reasons of lack. I have not cheated, the one small puff deal or otherwise. Just found this sub and have found some good advice.

Day 1 and I feel pretty optimistic.

and heeeerrreee comes the weekend!

This is the first weekend since started my quit.  I typically only smoked on weekends (a lot!) when drinking.  All I can think about at the moment is sitting on the porch with a beer/wine and a smoke, the usual Friday night ritual.  Plan for tonight is to stay in and not drink and try to keep busy.

Going out with friends tomorrow night to a show.  ALL the friends smoke.  This will be tough.  I am trying to just keep going over all my reasons for quitting over and over and over in my head.  I feel like even if I don't drink tomorrow night all the triggers will be there.  All. The. Triggers.  Any advice?

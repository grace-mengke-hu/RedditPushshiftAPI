Almost through week 1

I'm nearly through a week. No attempt to quit in the past has ever felt like this for me. I posted here the night of the super bowl when I had a little buzz on asking if it's possible to quit out of the blue at random. Well, I've got to say that so far it is the best attempt I've ever made.  

I don't feel like a smoker who is quitting. I feel like a non smoker and it's the first time in 10 years I've felt this way. I'm running multiple times a day, I'm taking big breaths of fresh air every now and again almost like I can't believe it's real. The change in just these 4 days has been incredible.

I'm so thankful for this sub! Stay strong everyone!

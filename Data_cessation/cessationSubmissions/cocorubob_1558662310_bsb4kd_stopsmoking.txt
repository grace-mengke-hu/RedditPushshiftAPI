Needing a little reassurance and motivation..

My last cigarette was 9 hours ago. I know for some that doesn't sound very long. But for me it is. Usually as soon as I see I'm down to 2-3 smokes, I'll go to the store and grab a pack. It's taking everything in me to not go get more. I want to quit so badly. But the habit is so strong. It's such a beautiful evening! I just want to go on the patio and smoke and have a drink.. Talk me down please!

2 Weeks :)

I decided to quit on 30th June. I had to quit again on 1st July. I had to quit for the third time on July 4th.

But since then I haven't smoked a cigarette. I went through constipation (still suffering from it a bit), some mood swings, and urges.

But yesterday I was sure I would break it. My friend asked me if I wanted a smoke.

I said 'maybe later.' (He doesn't know yet that I quit.)

And I stood there just watching him smoke.
It was a weird feeling. I've had non-smoking friends who gave me company through a cigarette, but I couldn't remember the last time I watched someone smoke where I wasn't smoking or had just finished smoking.

And it's just another day. 2 weeks officially now.

Stay strong guys. We are in this together :)

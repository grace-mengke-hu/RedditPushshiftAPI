I was able to quit after 10 years because of herbal hand rolled cigarettes


I smoked well over a pack a day for the better part of the last decade. People still don't believe me, I was a notorious chimney but it's been a year now, cig free. 

Here is how I quit :

I weaned. I got a silver cig case and only let myself bring 5 to work (I hand rolled my cigs so I just pre rolled every morning) for the day, then 3, then 2, then 1 etc. for a full month. Then I quit. Around day 5 I was having a full mental breakdown. 

Then I ordered these and fuck... I dont know how anyone successfully quits without something like this to keep them hanging on during those "im gonna go buy a pack YOLO, fuckit moments". 
Herbal Smoking Blend I hand rolled:

Especially helpful when around old smoker friends to this day sometimes. They were my crutch for the first month, but really after you have released all the nicotine from your body these are non-addictive and the mullein helps clear the lungs of tobacco you just don't really want them anymore. But they are always there for when you are craving for the next year or if you ever feel like giving up. They are the closest you will ever get to having a "healthy" cigarette.  

I also started drinking tons of herbal tea. Instead of taking cigarette breaks I have tea time. It is acceptable at jobs, offices, work to hit the break room and make tea usually too. It is ritualistic, but healthy, keeps me better hydrated. 

i hope this helps someone those herbal smokes were a life raft.

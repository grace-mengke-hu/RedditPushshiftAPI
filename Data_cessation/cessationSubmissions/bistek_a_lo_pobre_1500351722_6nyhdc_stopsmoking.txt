Wakingup over the 2 yrs mark

Timezones may be messing up with my badge, but it's been two yrs since I stopped smoking after 15 years.

I picked up calisthenics and weight lifting to gain muscle mass instead of fat, I can run longer and faster, my skin looks better, I saved over 1,000 â‚¬ (a blessing, since I was unemployed at the time and have been underemployed since then).

The breakthrough for me was "I can get cigarettes anytime I want, it's that easy. **I don't want to**"

I wanna thank y'all, the mods and whoever is struggling like us.

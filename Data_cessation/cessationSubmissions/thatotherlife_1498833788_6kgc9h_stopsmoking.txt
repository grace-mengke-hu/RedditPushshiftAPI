I had a dream...

A few days ago I dreamt that I was in some social situation and I reluctantly smoked a cigarette convincing myself I am sad and I get to do this. My brain was spouting so many excuses all the while I puffed away that cigarette. 

I was still in bed ,eyes closed in the morning and being dead scared of the one thing I never want to have to repeat again, the first few days of quitting. 

Yes, I was terrified at the prospect of having to bite into my knuckles one more time, isolate myself from people so I won't go nuts on them ,self reflect so much that it hurt my brain and realize what a true slave I am to cigs despite all the bullshit I was feeding myself about how easily I could quit if there have to. NOPE! I was terrified of getting out of bed to have to live through that again. 

The relief was beyond anything I can explain, I don't remember anything about the cigarette I smoked ,I don't think I enjoyed it or even if I did I don't remember it. All that is left of that experience was how I felt that morning it was not disappointment or sadness it was pure dread.. of having to repeat that first few days; it was hard enough on me that I had to suppress those memories. Now to revisit and borrow from that to do it all over again was simply unthinkable for me. 

I am glad it was a dream but that experience made me realize that I am where I am out of fear. I may be reaping so many benefits and telling myself so many wonderful things and I do believe in all of them but what truly keeps me in check is fear. This also means I am one of those people whose brain is not reprogrammed to saying 'cigarette ,ewww ' kind , it's still on low simmer somewhere and I need to be consciously aware of that aspect.  

I don't mind fear ruling this decision for me but sometimes I do wish a different kind of wisdom dawned on me ,maybe that takes time but until then I'll take what I can get.

Night sweats even after a week!

I've been a smoker for the last 15 yrs, and just went cold turkey 8 days ago, just wanted to check in as been looking through some post and don't see any that really relate to myself, just wanted to know if anyone else having bad night sweats, and I mean bad! thought I had pissed!! the bed the first couple nights... But it's definitely sweat to the point where I've been changing sheets every morning due to this, sleeping is also a hassle at present, struggling to settle and restless throughout the night. Any advise / thoughts welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read.

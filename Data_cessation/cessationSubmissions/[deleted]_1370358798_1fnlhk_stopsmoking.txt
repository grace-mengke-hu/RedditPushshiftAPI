I want to quit nicotine, period.

So okay, once upon a time, I was that person that got disgusted with people smoking. My dad's been smoking since he was 13, and I just never liked it. I would get physically ill if I saw my SO (when were younger) take one offered to him.  He wasn't a smoker either, but sometimes falls prey to "less dangerous substance" peer pressure.  Anyway, fast forward a few years, and my now husband came back for leave from Iraq. He'd gotten hooked on cigarettes while over there.  We had a stupid argument which I can't remember why, and after we'd cooled down, he offered me a cig, and I was still a little pissed at him so I took it. It was all down hill from there. Now I'm not nearly a pack a day smoker, in fact, I can go 4-5 days on one pack. The problem is the social drinking-smoking that inevitably follows. I become a chain smoker when tipsy. I always regret it the next day when my voice sounds like it dropped an octave and my throat hurts. To tide the cravings over when I'm at work, I have Camel snus pouches that I don't have to spit. It's stupid and gross and I'm hating myself for falling into the trap, especially with my prior views on it. I want to feel good again, and I think the nicotine is contributing to what I feel is mild depression. Any who, if you guys can point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.

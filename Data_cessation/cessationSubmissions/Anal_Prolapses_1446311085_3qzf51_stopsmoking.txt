Will I ever feel like a non-smoker?

It's only been three weeks, but I'm wondering if I'll ever feel like a non-smoker. Because right now it feels like I'm just a smoker who isn't smoking, and that's tough. It's a craving pretty much in every situation every day to want to smoke afterwards. Not entirely physical, it's also mental. I'm a smoker. Does this go away?

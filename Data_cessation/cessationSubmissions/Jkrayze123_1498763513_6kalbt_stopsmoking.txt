4 days in and feeling alright

Hey all, I just wanted to say how helpful reading all of your experiences has been for me. Y'all are awesome. I'm only four days clean (after smoking 5-10 everyday for 8 years) but feeling confident! Thanks to everyone on here. It is a huge help to have this resource. We can do it!

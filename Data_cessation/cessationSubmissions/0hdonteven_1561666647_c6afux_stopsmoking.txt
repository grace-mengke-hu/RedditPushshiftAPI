Joined Reddit to join this group

Hello, this is my first ever post to Reddit. I joined up because I got the  SmokeFree app and it keeps directing me to this group, and I figured I could use the extra help bc I'm not doing super great on my own.

Background, been a smoker for about 11 years (Jesus), and I vary between smoking 1-3 a day to chainsmoking a whole pack some evenings. Definitely know that drinking is a huge barrier to staying quit, so I committed to quitting smokes and drinking less in early June. Did great for 10 days, then smoked one. Kept going for ten more days, broke down and smoked 4-5. Since then it's been about a week and a half and I've lapsed twice, smoking two cigs each time. 

I'm really bummed and not motivated to keep going. I love smoking about as much as I hate it. I wish I could just keep smoking. This is too hard and it sucks. Lol. Argh. Anyway, I haven't smoked since Tuesday evening. 

So, hi

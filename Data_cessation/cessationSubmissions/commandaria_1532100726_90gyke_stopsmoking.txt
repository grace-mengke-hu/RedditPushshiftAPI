12 days smoke free

I have been smoking for over 8 years at 10 sticks a day before quiting. Prior to, I was going to try champix with my coworker, I had the pills in hand; however, after reading the disclaimer, I decided to try cold turkey and it honestly, has not been to hard. I do get cravings and I find it’s harder to sleep, I do wake up sweaty at times, and I have been eating more. But beyond that, it has been manageable. Yet, I haven’t felt a substantial change in my health as I am still wheezy and my nose is sill slightly plugged. I do sleep with a/c on at night (as I like to bundle up with my blanket). Could this be detrimental to my lung recovery (ie breathing in cold air). Furthermore, as someone who also partakes in some weed (for ~14 years), I find it much harder to try and to succeed in quiting weed than cigarettes. I tried to do them both but I relapsed on weed but not cigarettes. Anyways, biggest test is end of the month as I’m going camping. And cigarette and camping go well together!

I quit quitting too often.

So I've tried to quit smoking multiple times, and have had moderate success (I think I maxed out at 3 weeks). But it seems every time I go back I smoke even more than before, and it's even harder to quit or even think about quitting. On top of that, both of my room mates smoke. As an electrician I spend most of my days outside and all of my coworkers smoke, so I'm constantly reminded of the delicious cancerous burn. I have most of a pack that I bought last night, and I really want this to be my last. 
Help :( I don't know where to start.

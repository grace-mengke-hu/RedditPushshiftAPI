Good Morning! On day 1.5 :)

I decided to quit half way through the day yesterday because I just realized "I'm so fucking done with this." So officially, I'm at 14 hours and 49 minutes. ;)

Downloaded the app, annoying people around me with "saved 75 cents! What what!?". Lol. The last time I quit, I used an e-cig to taper off. Did it over a year ago for about 5 months. Then picked it up again when I was stressed. Cold turkey this time. I don't want anything to do with this horrible drug that has ruled my life for the past 11 years. (I'm 29)

Just here for help, support and to support others. I'm halfway through EASYWAY, but honestly, I'm feeling 100% and I know this is going to work because my mind and my heart are in it together.

We got this!!! Can't wait to hit some milestones! :)


EDIT: 1 day, 2 hours down! Woot woot!!

Been a while, been stressed, been craving

Works been hell, we are remodeling the house and trying to get gifts for the holidays and save for taxes. I'm trying to set up my basement to have a wine cellar and a small wood shop so I can do more freelance in my spare time. I'm grinding through over time. I feel like after 4 years I'm still the shit monkey at my job, and apparently all I do is annoyed people, even when I'm trying to be as small and go as planned I noticed as possibly, that still bothers people. All my spare money is going else were. I'm tired, frustrated and unsatisfied, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight.

The cravings are mild, but it bothers the fuck out of me that I have them at all. The only thing that's really keeping me from caving is the rock solid knowledge that it won't solve anything. If anything in the long run it will only make my anxiaties worse and drain what little money I get to keep for my self.

Just needed to rant. Merry fucking Christmas all you non smokers.

My holidays present to my girlfriend, one month smoke free.

I was again up to 2 packs of menthols a day, after having managed 8 months without smoking back in 2012. I chose November 25th to quit, so it would be one month on Xmas day!

My only aid was madly chewing spearmint gum for about a week after quitting. Then I stopped the gum chewing because it was giving me me bad headaches.

I managed to remain smoke free even after my boss gave my early christmas present, "the flexibility" to look for a new job, since he was firing me. 

For now... it's a struggle to not pick up a pack, but I am hanging in there!

Chantix?

Hi guys. I’m new here &amp; wondering if anyone has experience using Chantix to quit? I am about to hit day 5 without smokes but the side effects (for me, bloating, nausea, sleep difficulty) are significant and I’m thinking about stopping using this aid. I’ve reached out to my doctor to ask for recommendations. 

Congrats to other recent non-smokers :)

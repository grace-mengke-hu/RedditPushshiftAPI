First day of my eleventy-billionth time quitting!

I was taking the polish off my fingernails yesterday and noticed that my left index finger was yellow. My lungs are probably black as tar, and my breath and hair probably smell hideous, but for some reason, that yellow finger grossed me out more than anything. Flushed the brand new pack of smokes down the toilet and bought a starter pack of nicotine patches, and here I am, nearly at the 24-hour mark. Maybe this'll be the time that finally works!

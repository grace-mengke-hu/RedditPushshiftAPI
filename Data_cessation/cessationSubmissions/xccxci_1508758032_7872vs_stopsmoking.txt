Decided to quit smoking tobacco after 13 years and weed after 4 years.

I believe that for me to quit cigarettes will be way more painful and stressful than weed. The thought that a cigarette wont be available to me, when I want it, really fills me up too much anxiety. Although I believe I can do it, are there any tips/tricks you would like to share? I look forward to posting more updates here.

On Day 8 - while writing my bachelors thesis - for the love of good cant concentrate - need your advice

Hello my fellow non-smokers :)

A little background:

Im in my mid 20's and started smoking with 14/15 (On the countryside in Germany that’s not so uncommon). There are tons of reasons to stop smoking, but one which motivates me the most is that I want to become more healthy and better at sports (hiking, mountaineering, running) and that i already smoked 10 years.. (jfc..)

my actual situation:

I have to write my bachelor thesis till the beginning of march and i stopped smoking on the evening of the 1st december. so far so good. the first days were "kinda easy" and if not much stress gets thrown upon me everything seems doable. but if there are just slightly stressful situations i tend to become a mixture of aggressive/depressive/tired/wanting to cry/uneasy and so on. I mean I'm not dying but this is really hard to handle and damages my relationship with my gf in many ways.

additionally, as i stated i have to write my bachelors thesis right now and tomorrow i have to submit a 5 page summary of what i want to write and so on. and for the love of god, its sunday and i wasnt able to have a clear thought for more than 10 seconds over the weekend. i was sitting friday to now in the university and could get shit done because i cant think clearly and cant concentrate on creative thoughts..

So: I was thinking maybe that’s just all in all to much right now and maybe i should try to use these nicotine patches just to be able to work and do my bachelors degree with a good grade - even if this means giving up a little bit on the "cold-turkey" strategy i had. to be clear i really dont want to inhale any smoke anymore in my life but apparently my body and my dopamine levels in my brain block the possibility of stopping to smoke and at the same time be a productive academic.

whats your opinion?

cheers and thanks in advance.

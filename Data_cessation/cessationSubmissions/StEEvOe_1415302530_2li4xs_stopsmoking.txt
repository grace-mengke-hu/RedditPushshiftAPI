Still on day one

Almost slipped my cigarettes are gone but have people in the house who smoke, still motivated to stop. I'm doing okay but the I usually have a smoke right after I wake up, out of routine I tried to reach for one but they were gone. Almost went nuts looking for them, then after I fully woke up I realized I'm not smoking anymore. I'm ready for day 2

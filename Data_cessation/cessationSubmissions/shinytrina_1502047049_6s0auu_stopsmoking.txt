5.5 days in and this is one of the worst days thus far

I have been doing well up to this point, however today has been one of the worst days for myself and I'm honestly not sure why this is so hard.

It all started with waking up this morning with a huge craving.  Some deep breaths and cold water later I was doing better.  Then after cleaning my apartment, I so wanted to take a break and go for a cigarette.

I just keep on drinking lots of cold water and finding things to do to keep myself busy :)

It also helps that I have a friend that I can talk to anytime things seem grey, especially today.  I have been checking in with her every morning this week.  She quit over 2 months ago so she fully understands what I am going through, including the crying outbursts over the smallest of things.

I bought a pack recently...

And I'm okay with it. I am disappointed with myself, but I've come to realize in my quitting of other things that part of the process is fucking up. I haven't gone crazy and smoked the whole thing in a day, I've kept the mentality that I am still quitting cigarettes, and I have told those close to me to calle out on my bullshit if I seem to start smoking in earnest again.


This is just a reminder to everyone that giving in doesn't mean you've given up. As long as you come out of your moment of relapse with resolve it doesn't have to send you back to square one.

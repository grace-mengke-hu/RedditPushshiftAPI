Seething Anger

Day 59

Sometimes I find myself just being incredibly angry. For no real reason. Just takes something small to set me off and I just want to fucking punch everyone. Just happened and I’m absolutely livid about something small.

P.s. don’t worry I’m not actually going to punch everyone. I’ve never punched anyone in anger in my life

3 weeks... and more to come!

This is not my first attempt to quit, nor my first post in this sub.

I am 22 yo, smoked my first cig when I was 16 and got the pack/day habit 3 years ago after smoking around 10 cigs per day for the first 3 years.

I started feeling bad every morning like 6 months ago, and it got worst last December: it was way more than a chest pain, it sometimes felt like a pain coming from the inside... a lungs horrible pain. The problem was that I used to fix this pain by smoking a cig or two...

I decided to quit early december, but didn't make it for more than 4 days... then smoked 3 or 4 days, and quit for 3 or 4 again... until I was at my regular pack/day. 

January 14th, my lungs pain was so bad I just promised myself I won't hurt myself  moking anymore. I just sat in my living room, smoked the last 4 cigs in a row in less than 10 minutes. 

January 15th was a new day. I felt bad and I had my lungs pain for many days. But It got better pretty quickly and I didn't had any puff.

I didn't change any of my habits: am still drinking coffee, hanging out with my smoker friends and co-workers and going to bars where smoking is allowed. I sometimes have a quick urge, and it generally doesn't last more than 5min. I am usually not tempted at all even when surrounded by smoker friends only (basically all my friends smoke).

I feel good, and I am happy. It's been 3 weeks now and I want it to last forever. I feel healthier than ever: I walk for at least 40min a day (20min to go to work) and I am planning to start running as well on the weekends. I also have more appetite (no junk food at all, fortunately) and more overall strength and energy when doing any activity.

Thank you for being here. I've been reading lots of good stories in this sub and here is mine, finally, thanks to it!

I will update with other milestones of my non-smoker journey.

PS: sex feels way better as well after quitting.

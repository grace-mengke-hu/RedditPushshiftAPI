31 days of not smoking, here's how it went...

Sorry this ended up super long! 

I made it 1 month without smoking and I kind of can’t believe it.  I just want to give a rundown of my experience for those who are just starting. I still get cravings, and I am still very cautious, but I feel vastly different than those first 2 weeks of suck. Here we go…

**How long and how much:** I am 33(F). Smoked from 2002-2008, quit for 3 years, started up again in 2011 after my dad died of LUNG CANCER. Smart. Both times it started out as social smoking that turned into stress smoking that turned into full blown smoker. When I was not drinking, I probably averaged about 5-6 a day. When I was drinking, probably a pack since I chain-smoked.

**Why I quit:** I started to hate that I smoked but couldn’t stop.  I never smoked in my car, I never smoked at work, I never smoked in front of my Mom, I only smoked at home, or with friends who smoked.  I was so EXTRA cautious about the where, when and how, it was fucking exhausting.  It turned me into someone who only wanted to stay home, because I could comfortably feed my addiction there.  It also caused a MASSIVE amount of anxiety.  I worried every day that I was dying of lung cancer, that I developed COPD, that I had blood clots, that I had this, that, and the other.

**Days 1-4:** I quit on a Tuesday. So Tuesday-Friday all I did was go to work, ate whatever I wanted, and went to bed insanely early. I didn’t engage with friends, or my fiancé (I gave him a heads up of course and just asked for patience and forgiveness if I got crabby). I tried to turn my brain off and just sleep through the pain. Friday evening my fiancé and I went out to dinner and drinks. I wanted to smoke so badly. I cried, I threw a fit, I went to bed.

**Days 5-11:** This was the pure hell part. I ended up with a cold (probably quitters flu), I was so depressed, emotional, drained, exhausted, angry, and sad. I spent many days crying and threw several temper tantrums (cute). I was coughing up gross stuff. I didn’t want to smoke, but I was just sad that I would never have one again. I missed it. I definitely was romanticizing smoking.  I came on this group and read the posts every free minute I had, I read Allen Carr’s book, I looked up every article I could read online, etc. I should also mention that my fiancé smokes and nearly all of my friends do as well, so I was consistently around it. I tried really hard to continue to do things that I would normally do, like sit out with my fiancé in the backyard. I honestly thought it would never get better and my life would just suck forever.

**Days 12-now:** I woke up day 12 and things were just \***different**\* from then on. I wasn’t sad anymore, I had more energy, my cold started going away, I rarely got any cravings during the week, I truly do not want to smoke. However, the weekends continued to test me (still do), but as each one passes I grow stronger. I spent so much time on the weekends smoking that I didn’t know what to do with all my free time. 

I clean more, I run more errands, I don’t drink as much, I go on walks, I can walk upstairs with ease, my anxiety has basically vanished, my digestive track is back to normal, my skin looks brighter, my teeth are whiter, all GOOD THINGS! I feel as if a weight has been lifted. I can hang out with the smokers and not want one, I can have drinks and not want one.

But sometimes the cravings get bad. When they do, I just come here and read, or if its too tough, I go home, or go to bed. I definitely drink way less now. I still have challenging times, and I am still a work in progress.  I know this is only the start.  And sometimes I get nervous about the future.  But I will NOT go back.

**TL;DR:** quit, felt like shit, then I felt better, less frequent cravings but they still happen, but overall worth it and so happy I am a quitter!

Please don’t give up on your quit. Life is much better on the other side. Thanks for reading!

I have been smoke free for 1 week now - advice to anyone wanting/hoping to quit

First off, 22 years old, female, been smoking since I was 18.

When I first started, I would have 10 a day on average, but then I hit a depressing stage in my life. For about 6-8 months I'd be smoking between 30-50 cigarettes, a cigarette every 20 minutes. Cutting down was hard, really hard, as smoking was my escape from the dramas happening at the time.

For about a year now, I'd be smoking between 2-6 cigarettes a day, practically nothing. Sometimes, I wouldn't smoke for a week just because I didn't need one. I'd go back to smoking simply because I suffer with Social Anxiety Disorder - smoking would be my escape from awkward situations and paranoid thoughts, it would calm me down.

Now, I WANT to quit, I don't want to live in that repetitive circle anymore, I don't want to escape from any dramas or social situations through smoking. This is important for YOU too, if you want to quit smoking.

I've tried quitting in the past, for reasons involving money, health, family not liking it etc. and it never really worked. Because deep down, I didn't WANT to quit, I enjoyed smoking and because I enjoyed it I'd go back to it and I'd feel guilty every single time.

**If *you* want to quit, then you must *want* it with every inch of your being. There must be no single bit of doubt in your mind, this has to be it.**

It doesn't matter how much you sugar coat it -

*I can't afford it

*I'll be healthier when I quit

*I'll be happier and people will respect me more

*My risk of lung cancer and heart attacks are greatly reduced

All of these points, as good as they are, are **completely irrelevant unless you absolutely want to do it**. There's no such thing as "Oh I've gone a few days without smoking, I'll treat myself to 1 cigarette and that's it", because lets face facts here, if you think that way then you have caved to the addiction and you must not want it deep down.

If you have failed to resist the temptation of a cancer stick, why have you? What is it about smoking exactly that brings you back? Other than the nicotine itself, there is another reason why you feel you need it, you must find that need first and tackle it bit by bit to face the task of stopping altogether.


As I say, I have gone 1 week now, and although you may think it's slightly hypocritical of me to say all this as I haven't been without a cigarette for as long as someone who is a year ahead, I've come to realise why I needed cigarettes in the first place and I've tackled that aspect in my mind. I have found it ten times easier to quit now than I ever have in the past, I am more confident in quitting and I just want to share my advice with you.

If you agree/disagree or want any other advice then please message/comment and I will answer in the best way I can.

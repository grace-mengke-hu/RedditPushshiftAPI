I'm fucking done with this shit

My badge is from one of my "tries" to stop smoking. But I failed.

I can't take it anymore.

I've been smoking for 6 years now und I tried to quit so many times. I always find excuses why right now is a bad time to stop.

But there will never be a better time than now. It HAS to be done.

I want to run 5 miles without feeling I'm breathing fire.
I want to smell good again.
I want to leave my home without checking if I have cigarettes and a lighter on me.
I want to go out partying without thinking about having a fucking smoke.
I want to spend the money I'm saving elsewhere.
I want to smell fresh grass and good food again.

And I want to be fucking FREE again. This shit not only poisons my body, it poisons my mind. I'm either thinking about smoking or quitting this shit.

But this time will be different. I realize that I won't stop this addiction simply by having some half assed "tries".
I will do it. I will do it now. 
I will fight every urge, every thought about smoking.

Fuck this shit.
I can do this.

Cilia breaking free or summer cold?

June first was D-Day; it was my first day without a cigarette. This past Monday I started getting a tickle in my throat, which has since developed into nasal congestion and, finally today, a pretty productive cough. I'm wondering, do I have a summer cold or are my cilia finally breaking free? I've definitely got some lethargy going on with it and my head feels like a balloon (probably from the congestion). There is a summer cold going around where I live, so I'm not really sure. Advice or opinions? For now DayQuil, cough drops, water, and Nyquil have been my buddies.

Today's the day

I've been smoking about 5 a day for about a year now, and I don't want this to be the rest of my life. All the men on both sides of my family have a long list of health problems and my mom's a smoker. I've gone one or two days without it before but this is the real deal. 

Going to bed, going to work, and plan on a lot of working out over the weekend to get through the first three days.

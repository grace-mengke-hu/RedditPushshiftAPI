Going on holiday with my smoker friends. Gonna be tough, I am actually afraid.

Reddit, this is gonna be a tough one. I'm going on holiday with my 4 best mates and we're going to be stuck in a camper together for 8 days!
They all smoke minus one ( who does smokes weed), I myself haven't touched a cigarette since 10/10/14 BUT I have had a couple of joints with tobacco inside, even though I promised I wouldn't.

I'm afraid that my mind is gonna say "Oh fuck it, your'e on holiday with your friends have fun". 
I still smoke weed, so I'm going to buy my own and smoke it with no tobacco.

I don't want to smoke, I know it's bad, but lately my mind has been playing tricks on me and I have had a few cravings. 

I'm going to do the X effect method (r/theXeffect), and plow through this trip.

Thanks for listening, will report back hopefully nicotine free

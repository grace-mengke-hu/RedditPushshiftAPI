Any restaurant employees who have successfully quit, how did you do it.

I want to quit everyday it sickens me but every night at work the second i get a second off the line im right outside pounding down 2 back to back. Any tips or tricks anyone has would be greatly appreciated. My birthday is in 2 weeks and my gift i would truly like to give myself is freedom from this damned addiction.

Want to quit forever

On 2nd January 2018 i decide to quit smoking had my last cigarette and up until the new year night i never had one. On new year's night i smoked one and i regretted it. 

Ever since that night i am seeing my self smoking occasionally and the amount of cigarettes are increasing. I am letting my urge to get the best of me. Even tonight i smoked more than 5 cigarettes at a coffee with my friends.

After smoking everytime i feel bad and disgusted of myself. I cant control these urges I'm having these days. I want to quit this now and forever before i start smoking regularly again. 

So please guys help me and motivate me.

any cig quitters that smoke cigars once in awhile?

So, before I quit 5 days ago, my go to nicotine fix was a pack a day of Parliament lights (dat recessed filter!).  But every once in awhile, I would go to a cigar lounge with my buddy and we would have a glass of scotch and smoke a cigar together while we catch up (like once a month or once every 2 months).  

Are there any current cigar smokers that quit cigs?

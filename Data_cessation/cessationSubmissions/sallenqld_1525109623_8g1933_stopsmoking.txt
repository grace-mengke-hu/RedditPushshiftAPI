Quit 4 days ago and just ran an 8k!! 🏃‍♂️

I’ve been struggling with quitting for most of my adult life. I would quit for about 6 months or so and as soon as a stressful period of my life hit I’d be back smoking again. As a 32 yo male I finally quit on 4/26.

Last fall I made the promise to myself to quit and I to get healthy and take up running.  I’ve been training for this 8km race all spring. The race was this Saturday and I only quit 3 days before it. I finished the race running a 10:00+ minute mile, without walking! I was super happy with it and my wife is super impressed. I also got a prescription for nicotine gum and lozenges and am managing my cravings with a quit app.

I feel that I have really set myself up for success this time!

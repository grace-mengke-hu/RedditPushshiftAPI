Five days in!

Had a rough start getting to finally take the jump, but I quit cold turkey and it's been five days now. It feels really great. Surprisingly, the fourth day was without a doubt the worst. I started quitting during my work week, so it was actually a little easier to not break away for a cancer stick because I work with little guys in social services. My clients don't tell me I smell funny anymore (it's the little things ;)). So, now I'm entering the weekend and I'm finding wayyy too much downtime. Plan is to just keep sticking to it and stay as distracted as possible (GTA 5 can't come soon enough).
Thanks for keeping me motivated! When I feel stressed at work, I flip through here or open up the app that tells me how much money I've saved. It has undoubtedly been tough, but I can feel that I'm going to make it.

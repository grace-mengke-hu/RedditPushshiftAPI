Fuck

So, even though I'm pretty sure it's too late and throat cancer is rapidly spreading throughout my body, I quit smoking today. Well, more accurately, I woke up with a sore throat and in a frantic rage I ripped up the carton I just bought and soaked it with the garden hose. First thing I've noticed is that I'm dying anyway so I should've just kept my smokes. 

I don't know what my point is, I just needed to say something to somebody about it.

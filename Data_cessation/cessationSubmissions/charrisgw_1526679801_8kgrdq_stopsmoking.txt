No more "I'm gonnas"

It feels really good today to be on the other side of "I'm gonna quit". Now I "have quit" and it was about damned time.

I guess it took what it took for me to get here but looking back, I'm not sure what I was waiting for :). Anyway, just checking in and thrilled to be smoke free today. If you haven't jumped in yet, there's no time like now. Cheers.

Feels like just yesterday but wow it feels great to be 7 months free

Used to smoke 20 a day for 5 years. Decided I was being a complete idiot and my brain was hijacked by nicotine and I and only I should have control of my own thoughts and would not be a slave to something that was killing me. 7 months ago I decided enough was enough and I would quit. 3rd attempt. Difference this time was that I really wanted to. I didn't believe believe I could go 7 hours without a smoke before let alone 7 months. But let me tell you it feels fantastic. Smoking Is a curse on your life and whatever reason your hijacked nicotine controlled brain tells you to continue is bs. It feels good to be free :D

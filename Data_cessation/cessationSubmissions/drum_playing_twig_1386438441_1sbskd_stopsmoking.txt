0 days in. I smoke. I don't want to. But it's the only thing that keeps me together. How can I change this mentality?

So I've gone through a rough couple of years of depression, unemployment, huge amounts of debt, social isolation, obesity and suicidal thoughts. 

But as of one month ago, I did a 180 in my life. I've found a job, made payment plans for my debts, started working out, started to slowly calling up old friends to rebuild my social network etc. 

So basically my life is much better right now, I'm feeling happiness for the first time in many years. 

**BUT** I really can't stop smoking. I feel it's the only thing keeping me sane right now, with all these new changes happening so suddenly. Every little thing is a struggle right now. Waking up at 5 to go to the gym, calling lost friends, going to work, just about every little thing causes anxiety or some other form of discomfort. 

And smoking is what relaxes me, gives me joy, calms me down. And I hate that I love it so much.

Words of wisdom, anyone?

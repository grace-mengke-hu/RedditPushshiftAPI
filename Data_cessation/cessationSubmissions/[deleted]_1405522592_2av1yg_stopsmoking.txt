Smoker for 15 years - *Quitting*

So I've been on and off chantix for a little over a year now. 

It's my third attempt with chantix. Id start, make it three weeks, screw up. 

Instead of admitting defeat I'd lower my chantix intake dramatically just because i know how awful it is for me to ramp up on that drug. 

Now I'm a week in, after multiple fails over the last year and a half. 

I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO MAKE IT THIS TIME. 

I hate willpower lol.

I am thankful for this subreddit.

Today marks my third year as a non smoker. I credit most of my success to this community. The support made a huge difference in my recovery and I am grateful for that support. (When reading this back to myself, I sound like I'm that bad tax commercial: "I made the call." It's pretty funny). Anyway, keep going, it gets easier.

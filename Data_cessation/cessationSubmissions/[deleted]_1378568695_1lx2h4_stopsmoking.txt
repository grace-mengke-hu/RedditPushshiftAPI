I need you guys

Every time I run out of cigs I wait until I get a craving and then I buy another pack. I can't seem to break this cycle, the cravings are something that so easy for me to justify and I feel like shit after I do it. I just bought another pack and I can't keep doing this. How, how do I say no when I want a cig so badly and I can imagine how good it will feel? Fuck.

Made it - now addicted to food and alcohol

I eat nonstop, to the point where I am full and I feel unsatiated, its horrible. 
I'm drunk on a weeknight - I've tried to quit with the alcohol free beers, but whenever I get down, like today, I just go for the alcohol, I'm on my 7th pint atm. House cannot be alcohol free as I am in shared accommodation (I end up stealing).
 I put on 12 kg in 84 days. I'm walking over 3 miles a day to try lose weight and my feet are sore - generally just feel like shit.

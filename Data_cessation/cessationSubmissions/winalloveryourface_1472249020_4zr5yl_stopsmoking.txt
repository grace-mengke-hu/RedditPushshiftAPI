I'm at home, a little boozed, windows are open and my neighbours are smoking

I really want one. 

I've got none, not kept a pack on standby since the Â£5 a cigarette debacle of 3 weeks past. Where I'd buy a pack of 10 and a lighter to smoke one and throw the rest away.

But right now, the neighbour fags are sending me in a frenzy. So tempted to charge the e-cig just for a quick fix.

I'm sticking though. Tomorrow will be easy again.

Relapsed.

I feel like shit. I need to quit because I have a wound that needs to heal and smoking will increase the chance of it getting infected, and also will slow down the healing. I've been smoke free for 5 days and I had cigarettes with me... And I was at home, alone and bored. So I smoked. Now I feel like shit. I really shouldn't have done it. Whoever feels like they want to smoke right now... Don't. You are not missing out. I wish I could turn back time. It wasn't easy getting that streak.

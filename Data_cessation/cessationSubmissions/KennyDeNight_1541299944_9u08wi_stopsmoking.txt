Stop Smoking Because It Is Slowing You Down

I've been smoking since I was 17. I'm 23 now, almost 24. I know that isn't a lot of time but I don't think the duration of time is what matters. It's the mindset. I feel like cannabis was with me through my biggest years of "becoming me" &amp; I think that the next big step for me is to stop smoking. My thing is that I've tried so many times before and I never went through with it. My biggest problem with it is I feel like it just makes me slower. Before I was so creative, so motivated when I would smoke. Now I just wanna smoke more weed. &amp; it never gets to that point where I'm satisfied. So I have this question as well as something to offer. I made a video about my current predicament with cannabis if you're interested. link will be below. Do you think Weed is slowing you down from achieving your goals? I wanna know if you guys are dealing with something similar. Let me know!

2 weeks cold turkey, loss of motivation

I have been a 3-10 cig a day smoker (and binge smoking while drinking) for the past 11 years, and finally got the nerve to quit after my 30th birthday. However, I've also stopped socializing and leaving the house as much. I find I dont have as much motivation to do certain things without the cigarette reward. 

I work from home, so the motivation to get up and dressed was often to have a cigarette outside. Motivation for chores like getting groceries or anxiety inducing social activities was cigarettes. Writing late into the night, cigarettes. I feel like I've lost a lot of motivation that kept me going through the day.

Any suggestions for substitutes? 

On the bright side, I love not buying cigs, and being able to smell stuff all the time!

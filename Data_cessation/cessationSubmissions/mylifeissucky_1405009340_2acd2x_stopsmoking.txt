My parents are devout Christians and prayer WORKS! Nowonder I quit smoking...

at the drop of a hat one random Friday. Mum prayed for me to be able to quit smoking and it was weird, but this random Friday that was last Friday, I quit and had no more cigarettes since. I don't know if you pray, but this might be part of what did it for me.

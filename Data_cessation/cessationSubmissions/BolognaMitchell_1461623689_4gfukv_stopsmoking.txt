Almost a week

I've smoked 5-10 cigarettes per day for about 8 years, and this is the first time in those 8 years I've ever went more than 24 hours without a cigarette. So it really is my first attempt at quitting. And it seems to be working. I feel great.

I did read the Allen Carr book about a year ago, and once again about 2 months ago, but honestly it just did not resonate with me the way that it seems to have for other people. I did not have a moment of clarity and didn't quit right after reading. But I will say that the general idea that "smoking has zero benefits" was the main reason I was able to get through the first couple of days. My mantra, every time I thought about smoking, was just to remind myself firmly that "a cigarette will NOT make you feel better, not now, and definitely not later". And it really worked wonders for the psychological side of quitting. Because if I just kept that one simple idea in the back of my head, there was no reason to go buy a pack.

I also have been drinking during the last 6 days, and I feel like it almost helped. I know for a lot of people drinking is a huge trigger for cravings, but for me it almost felt empowering to be able to drink a beer and not cave.

Sorry, I know this post has no central theme, I just wanted to ramble a little to pat myself on the back.

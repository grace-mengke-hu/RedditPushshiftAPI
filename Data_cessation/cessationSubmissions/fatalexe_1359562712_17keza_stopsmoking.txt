One year smoke free tomorrow.

First off, I would like to thank all of you recent quitters.  Checking this subreddit every day helps remind me how awful those first few weeks were.  Addiction to nicotine is a horrible disease I don't think I'll ever be totally rid of.  I can say honestly that I am a non-smoker now but I will never react to tobacco smoke around me like some one who never did in the first place.  Quitting was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.  I made a lot of changes in my lifestyle to facilitate it. I started quitting in 2010, they passed the smoking ban in North Carolina and I couldn't stand not being able to smoke in Waffle House.  Had spent the last decade working as a freelance programmer out of the booth there with a coffee cup and a cigarette in my hand all hours of the night.  I didn't quite manage to quit on that new years after making it just a few days. Tried a few more times that year and realized just how addicted I was.  Hooked up with a girl that year that didn't smoke so I quit for her, lasted about six months.  Ended up starting back again and breaking up with a few months later.  For me that was it.  I quit again using the nicotine patches.  Every one around my smoked and was tired of my endless attempts to quit.  Literally everywhere reminded me of smoking.  So I did the only thing I could, put my house on the market and reduced what I owned down to a backpack.  Caught a Amtrak sleeper car out to Montana and started life over again as a non-smoker.  There have been endless temptations but for some reason this time I've been able to hold fast.  My life is awesome out here in Big Sky country!  Found a full time job, a wonderful girlfriend who quit smoking when we started dating and I couldn't be happier. Some days I still consider going back to that old lifestyle, maybe moving to Idaho where you can still smoke inside but over all I want to stay quit.  Good luck to you all. If I can make it a year anyone can.

I celebrated one year yesterday :)

It was coincidence more than any kind of New Year resolution, but I finally made the decision and smoked my last cigarette at 1:00 AM January 1st, 2015. 

I smoked for 20 of my 41 years, and realized if I had a chance to be healthy and feel good er again, I had to stop **now**.

The first two months were really rough, and I still feel very strong cravings, but I managed to go cold turkey -- no pills, lozenges, patches, gum, vaping, or other substitution.

I did gain a little weight, but I'm countering that with a low carb diet, and I'm determined to start exercising soon.

I haven't posted often, but I have lurked a lot. This sub as well as a great app (Quit It), and the support of friends and family (who I tried to hide my smoking from) with regular public posts on Facebook all helped me to resist the urge to light up again.

Whatever the damage, it's done, but I don't have to continue slowly committing suicide. I want to *live*.

27 hours in, and I can't focus on anything.

I haven't had a cigarette in over a day, and I can barely maintain a train of thought.  I'm a journalist, and I have an article that is due on the 24th.  I worked on it all day, from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., and wrote down maybe 300 poorly chosen words.  I feel like my brain isn't working right, like there is a fog in my head that will only clear when I light the lantern of a smooth, smooth, Camel.  


I don't know how much longer I can do this.

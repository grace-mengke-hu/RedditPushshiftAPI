The Allen Carr video just made me decide it is time to stop smoking

I just wanted to make a post.  Someone kindly linked the video and I watched it.  I smoked when he told me to :) and ultimately, I am now quitting.  Ironically, the second cigarette he tells you to smoke tasted awful on my first puff, which was a bit weird actually.  I know quitting smoking is a mind over matter problem, but wow, who knew a video could do something as simple as that.

Anyway, I guess I am now on day 1.  So, for anyone who saw me hanging around earlier, I am finally not afraid to quit.  

Now my only concern is, what to do with the rest of my carton? :I

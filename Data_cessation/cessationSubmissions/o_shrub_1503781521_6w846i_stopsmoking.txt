Relapse triggers after the four month mark?

For those of you who have relapsed after the four month+ mark, what happened? My previous quit record was 17 days, and I really feel secure now in my new identity as former smoker. Cravings are infrequent and manageable. I'd like to be on the lookout for triggers specific to this stage.

Starting the journey

Well guys it's that time for me now, just ashed out my last cigarette and am starting tommarrow smoke free. Finally decided to give up after being the most ill I have ever been in my life, bedridden for two weeks, and still smoking through the illness. It was absolutely vile while vomiting and suffering constant nausea and headaches to still smoke and now I that I'm better I just can't stomach them. I figure now is the perfect time to quit since I just don't enjoy cigarettes anymore knowing the power they have over me. Got strong reasons to stop (aside from having been ill) and am ready to change my life for the better.

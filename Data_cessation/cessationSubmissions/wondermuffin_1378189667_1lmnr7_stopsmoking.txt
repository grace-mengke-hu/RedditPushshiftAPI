I got a cold for the first time since I quit

...and it really isn't that bad! 

Before when I got a cold during the winter months (I'm in Australia) It would be a week+ long affair, with a high chance of a sinus infection afterwards. 

I would smoke through the whole thing. Now it's three days and some mild congestion. None of the gross things that you hack up as a sick smoker, just a slightly runny nose and a mild fever.  A good reason for those in the northern hemisphere to quit before winter sets in!

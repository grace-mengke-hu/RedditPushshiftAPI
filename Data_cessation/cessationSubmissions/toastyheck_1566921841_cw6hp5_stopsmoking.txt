How it quit.

The way I quit smoking is weird but worked. I think it is so strange but I replaced the habit with pouring sea salt in my mouth and doing a salt water gargle every time I had a smoking craving. This reminded me of how yucky smoking made my mouth teeth and gums feel and replaced to with a nice soothing feeling of repairing any damage it had done instead. I now just to one salt water rinse a day and donâ€™t smoke at all. I am still tempted to try those personal essential oil diffusers (basically just vaping essential oils) but with the vape scare going on I am managing to hold out. If my cravings get too bad play a phone game or take a nap or do something to distract. Sometimes just dancing to music helps but sometimes that makes it worse because I love music videos and there is a lot of smoking in favorite ones.

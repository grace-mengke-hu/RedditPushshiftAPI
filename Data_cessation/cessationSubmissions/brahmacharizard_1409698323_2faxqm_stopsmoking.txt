The Easy Way/Insanity Wolf Method - supplemental activities or is the program just fine?

I have to say, this is the most novel quit smoking method I've come across-- 'HURRRR IS THAT A CRAVING? DIE FOUL BILE DEMON HURRRRRRRRRR'-- and it's working. 

I elected to watch the video presentation and let it wash over me; I feel it left a pretty deep imprint but was wondering if there's any kind of supplemental exercise people find useful. It definitely seems to be a kind of voluntary hypnosis and intentionally simplified so I don't want to confuse those very straightforward instructions with too much, ya know, thought or logic.

Your thoughts would be appreciated! May you remain smoke free today and tomorrow and the next, so on and so forth :)

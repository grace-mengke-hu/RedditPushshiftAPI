Urge to smoke when drinking.

Hey guys! I've been smoke free for 2.5 months now, but I have a problem where I can not seem to go out and enjoy a drink anymore. I'm not a heavy drinker by any means. I'm a 1 or 2 (maybe 3 if it's celebratory) kind of person. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I get visibilly cranky when I'm out now. My craving starts to get to strong to fight around 11pm, and so I just end up leaving so that way I don't have the chance to break down and buy one. Any advice?

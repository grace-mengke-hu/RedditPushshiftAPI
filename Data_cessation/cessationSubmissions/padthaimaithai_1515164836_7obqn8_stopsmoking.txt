Today is the day.

I had my last smoke before I went to sleep last night, 10.5 hours ago. I'm sick of smoking, but this will be hard. I work at a bar where they all know me as a smoker. I have 2 nights shifts in a row and then 4 full days off. 

If I can make it through the next two nights without slip up I'll be golden. I want this though. And I'm determined to stop.

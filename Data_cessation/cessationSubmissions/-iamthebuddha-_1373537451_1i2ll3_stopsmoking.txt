The Smoking Dream/Nightmare

I feel like I caved even though I didn't.

I had a dream that my brother and I were stepping out of his car on our way to linger outside a 7-11 before heading in.  He grabbed a smoke and handed one to me on the way in. 

I lit it up and took a drag and it tasted like shit.  I was disgusted and immediately wanted to put it out, but I knew my brother would give me shit for wasting a cigarette...and I hated the fact that I was smoking.  I felt weak.

Just as we were about to settle in to choke down our smokes outside the store, this customer came out and started berating us for smoking.  "What are you even doing that for!?" he asked (as if we should know better).  I stood there feeling like an idiot with a cigarette dangling in my fingers.

He carried on to his car.  I immediately stomped out the cigarette feeling like an dumbass for having accepted it in the first place.

The relief of waking up and realizing that it was all a dream was so, so very rewarding.  I felt like my subconscious was even on my side in the dream world.  The fear of re-addiction was so distressing.

It's so satisfying to kick it...and so terrifying to think that you've lost control again.

The change of mindset from Allen Carr and the support from this subreddit make it SO much easier than my 5-10 previous quit attempts.

Keep it up gang.

Stepping Down on Nicoderm

I quit 38 days ago after trying fairly consistently for a year and a half. I'm not sure why this time stuck, but it has!

I have been on step 1 Nicoderm the whole time, also wearing it at night.

I am going to go to step 2 next week. I'm nervous because I am expecting that I will likely be craving and grumpy. While I don't think about smoking much, I am definitely still addicted to the nicotine I am still getting. I notice cravings and grumpiness when I don't have it on for a while or wait to change it.

Does anyone have any advice or experiences to share that can help me prepare or ease my mind a little?

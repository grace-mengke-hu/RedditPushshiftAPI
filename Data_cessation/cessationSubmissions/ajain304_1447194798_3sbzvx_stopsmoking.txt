Smoking Cigarettes & Weed - Damage Reversible?

I am a 22 year old senior in college. I have been smoking about a quarter pack of cigarettes almost everyday since my sophomore year in college. I smoke weed as well but very occasionally (on average 1.5 times a week).

I recently decided to quit and while I am happy about my decision, I cannot help but feel sorry about the damage I've caused to myself.

I was wondering if these last 3 years of smoking have made me dumber? I still do well in classes but I am slower when it comes to grasping concepts and feel less sharp overall. How much of this damage can be attributed to smoking? Also, is this damage irreversible? What can I do to regain sharpness and reverse some of the damage?

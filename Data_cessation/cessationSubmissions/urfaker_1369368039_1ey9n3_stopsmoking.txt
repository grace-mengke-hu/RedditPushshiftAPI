I hate how this is controlling my life.

Today I realized just how much cigarettes are dominating how I interact with people. Very few people I know now are smoking.

Backstory: my roommate is getting married. His wife will be moving into our apartment and I'll be moving somewhere else, so we decided to have a last celebratory cookout. No one who showed up smoked, and my girlfriend hates that I do. There was a lot of beer flowing, and of course drinking accompanies smoking for me. I wanted to smoke so bad, but I knew my girlfriend would be upset, so I just held out and wanted everyone to leave, including my GF, so I could smoke in peace. Everyone left and I ended up shooing her out afterward (subtly, mind) just so I could have a smoke in peace.

I fucking hate this, but I've tried to quit so many times. I wish I didn't want it so bad. I read about half of the Easy Way, I've heard the virtues of cold turkey, of e-cigs, of god knows what else. I feel like I have very little self control. I've improved my diet through sheer force of will, but I never loved Dr. Pepper and McDonald's as much as I currently love cigarettes. I've cut soda and fast food from my life for years now, but I can't seem to cut out this thing that all of my family and friends hate. I just want to be fucking DONE WITH IT. What was it that kicked it off for those of you who have been nonsmokers for a while? What kept you going through the seemingly unavoidable, mind-dominating craving?

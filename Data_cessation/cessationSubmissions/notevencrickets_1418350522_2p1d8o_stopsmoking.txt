Putting the world on pause.

"Putting the world on pause." was a line I heard in a college lecture about addiction. I was in my 6th or 7th year of smoking and I didn't have a fucking clue what he was talking about. Whatever old man, give me my grade and let me move on.

Seven years later, when I finally made the decision, once and for all, this is it, that was the last one, there's no turning back, I can't go back now....now that I've gone so far...you've been planning this your entire smoker's life, this is it. I understand now, what he was saying.

My addiction was a pause button. It started innocently enough, hey I'm cool I smoke cigarettes. It grew into, hey, mind if I take a cigarette break? It cascaded into, I can't wait until I get out of this situation so I can smoke a fucking cigarette!

At some point cigarettes quit becoming breaks and became a pause on Life. It was my way of not dealing with shit. It was an easy decision to make, well fuck this I'll go smoke a cigarette.

I realized this and I finally made the commitment. I haven't smoked for a month now. I have been cheating with an e-cig. I'm still super depressed, and Life keeps crashing against me but I'm still a non smoker, treading water.

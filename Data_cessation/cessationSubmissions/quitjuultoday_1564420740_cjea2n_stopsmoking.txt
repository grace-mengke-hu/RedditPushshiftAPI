Freedom Pods Beta. AMA

We are a startup that wants to help people curb their nicotine addictions, mainly from JUUL. Our program starts you out at 5% and weans you down to a 0%, non-nicotine alternatives over the course of 6 months. During the 6 month program, we'll ship you all the vapes you need and you are to toss your JUUL.

After you've weaned off the nicotine based vape over 6 months, we'll offer non-nicotine alternatives, starting with an natural, blueberry flavored daily vitamin. We also plan to release many 0% nicotine flavor only with options for CBD infusion in the future.

[Freedom Pods](https://freedompods.co/) will come in mango and mint flavors packaged sleek disposable vapes.

Every user will have their own wean-down plan custom tailored to how many JUUL pods you're currently vaping through an algorithm verified by our Chief Medical Officer.

We have opened our website up to secure pre-orders that will start with the 1st month of vapes. The 1st program will go live from September '19 - February '20 for about 100 users.

The motivation for this startup was our personal addictions to JUUL and seeing other young people suffering from nicotine addiction from JUUL. Everytime we tried to quit cold turkey, we failed. We then started making our own custom pods with lower nic strengths. We're simply packaging it for the people that feel it's inconvenient to fill on your own. We also invented an all natural daily vitamin vape that will hopefully be the start the revolution in healthy vaping.

Read this if you are struggling or if you think you can't do it anymore

Has been a while since i logged this account, but I wanted to stop by this place since it helped me immensely.

I'm not smoking for 8 months. That's a lot of time, the app says it's 5855 hours. I still remember my first intercontinental flight: i had been forced to stay on a plane without smoking for 14 hours and it was a complete nightmare. And now i've been almost 6000 hours without smoking and i'm feeling GREAT!

I want to take this opportunity to help out everybody that is struggling. I was there 8 months ago and this place helped me a lot, probably i wouldn't have been able to do this without the support of complete strangers here on Reddit. So here's a few words that i think some of you might need to hear.

**It will get easier.** Take this as a mantra, because it's true. No matter who you are, no matter what you are going through, it's just a matter of time before it becomes easier. 

**Cravings will go away.** A lot of people are afraid that cravings will be there forever. That's not true, they will end. It may take more or less time than what you read online, but you will reach a point in your life where you just won't think about smoking anymore. 

**It gets better**. I promise.

You are courageous and strong, you decided to change your life for the better and there is not a single thing that won't improve from this choice. **Is the best choice you will ever make in your life, be happy that you did it!**

* Your health will improve
* Your self confidence will improve
* Your finances will improve
* Your lung capacity will improve
* You will start to enjoy physical activities
* Your sex drive will improve 
* Your sense of smell and taste will improve
* You won't stink anymore and your house will be clean
* Your skin, hair, teeth will be visibly better
* Your quality of life will improve
* You will live longer and you will live a better life

**Nothing bad can happen from this, you will only have things to gain.** You just have to be patient a for a while, and that's it!

All you have to do is to face this one day at a time: "do not smoke today" is the only thing that you should worry about. Don't think about tomorrow, a month from now or whenever in the future. Just focus on the present and on not smoking today!

On a final note, remember that there is this awesome and completely free website (it doesn't even have ads) with a lot of resources on nicotine addiction. It helps to be informed, so go check it out. When i quit I've read a lot of material and it helped me a big deal. Go check it out if you haven't already: http://whyquit.com/

And remember, you can always come here for support if in a moment of struggle!

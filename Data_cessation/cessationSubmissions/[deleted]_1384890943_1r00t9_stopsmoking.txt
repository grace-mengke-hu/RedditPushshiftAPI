Today is my day. Quitting cold turkey after smoking for 10+ years.

Hi everyone!

I am 25 and I've smoked for longer than I care to remember. It started with one of my female friends asking me to steal cigarettes from my mom and I just went from there. Now here I am in my 20s and today is my day 1. I always had trouble quitting in the past because I have awful anxiety, but this time I am attempting to quit in conjunction with starting Celexa. I am excited.

I'd quit before for 9 months and again later for 6. I made the mistake of getting drunk and telling myself that one pack wouldn't hurt. Well, I was wrong. Just one is one too many. This time I want it to be forever. It isn't just that I feel gross or that I worry about my health, but I'm tired of the coughing and spending $7 every day for a pack. This entire habit is nothing more than a waste. Of everything.

I am hoping that becoming part of the community will just reinforce my will to quit. I've always quit cold turkey without any support and maybe that is why I gave up so easily.

Thanks for reading. Good luck to everyone that's also on this journey.

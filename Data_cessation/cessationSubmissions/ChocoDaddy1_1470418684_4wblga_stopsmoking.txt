Nicotine Replacement & Quitting

Hello everyone, first time poster, long time attempter of quitting smoking. Today is my seventh day smoke-free, however I have been using Nicorette lozenges. I was smoking a pack a day for 3.5 years. I've read some studies that show that people who use nicotine replacements have more success in quitting than those who quit cold turkey, however I'm wondering if any of you have had success, or failure, quitting while using these replacements? I feel somewhat like I'm cheating. I've quit smoking for a week but have been pounding these lozenges pretty hard. Even still I feel irritable and have hard cravings for a cigarette at times. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Keep up the good work everyone!

Wanting to quit... Pack a day smoker as well as heavy "mix tokes" from the bong.

Hello
So I smoke about a pack in a 24 hour period. Mostly at work, but lately I've been smoking more frequently at home as well.
Car rides, walks, breaks, wherever I can fit one in.
On a 15 minute break at work I'll puff 2 back.
On a 30 minute break, sometimes 3.
And I go out for extra breaks multiple times a day. :/
As for the bong; I smoke constantly throughout the day. Maybe about 12 tokes a day. When I say "mix toke" I mean I bust the weed, and bust a layer of tobacco, from a cigarette, and chop it and mix it together, then smoke it.
I've been a heavy weed smoker for about 10 years, since I was 15. Started cigarettes the same time. So this will be a difficult road for me.

So anyway, I would like to put an end to this.
 I feel it definitely is something that has power over me. I like the feeling of inhaling, so gum didn't work. Vaping, just didn't satisfy the craving. Even with the 24mg nicotine juice. So I gave that up.

So I am wondering if anyone has tips or ideas on how to give up a habit that has so much control over me. I've tried whatever comes to your mind first, and have a hard time keeping busy. I smoke when i'm not doing anything, just to be doing something.

Thanks to all who reply in advance.

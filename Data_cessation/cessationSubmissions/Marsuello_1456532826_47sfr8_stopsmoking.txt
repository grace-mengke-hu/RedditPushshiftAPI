I want today to be my last day smoking, but i don't know how to do that

Basically i've been smoking about 5 or so years now and i'm fully ready to take the step and quit. i've tried a few times but it's generally backfired because i just go back to it since it's something to do when i get bored. i recently started a gym membership to get in shape and i'm realizing it's very difficult to smoke and work out. my lungs can't take it and i know if i want to make positive changes i should start here.

when i've "quit" before, i usually haven't had any massive cravings or anything. i just got bored and went back. longest i went without was about a month/month and a half so i know i can do it. i would just like some advice on how to keep myself motivated to make this change and how to keep it out of my life now for good. thanks for any help! first time poster so hopefully i did this right.

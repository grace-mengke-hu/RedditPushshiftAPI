100% Serious this time

About a year ago I made the decision that I didn't want smoking to rule my life anymore. I did an excellent job of cutting back on smoking but a horrible job of quitting. Instead of a pack a day it would be 1 smoke at lunch while at work and 5-10 over the weekend with my friends. I never bought a pack and I never asked for a smoke but if one was offered (which was constantly) I'd have a hard time saying no.

This past Christmas I left for a 2 week business trip and I broke down and bought a pack. This then turned into 2 packs and then 3. I didn't smoke while working but once I was back at the hotel and had nothing to do I would step outside every hour. 

When I landed back in my hometown I smoked my last cigarette. This was on January 8, 2018.

I didn't tell anybody. I had done so every other time that I "quit" and so the message wasn't going to be believed by anybody anyway. I haven't even told my wife about it. I fully intend to soon but I wanted to be able to say "I haven't had a cigarette in x days" instead of saying "I'm done."

It hasn't been terribly hard so far as I've just avoided situations that I used to smoke in. During lunch I either leave the office or sit at my desk and play a video game. I haven't really hung out with my friends since I've been back but I heard that they have quit smoking as of the new year. I know these will be the real tests but I am 100% confident in my ability to resist now.

I am excited to be able to breath again, to not be coughing randomly again, to not have to worry about when I'll be able to have the next cigarette, to have my wife not be worried that I'm going to die at 40, and so much more. 

Best of luck to all of you on your journey to being smoke free!

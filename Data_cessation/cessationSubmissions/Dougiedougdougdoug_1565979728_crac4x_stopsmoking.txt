Not a huge milestone, but it's a start.

Started smoking at the age of 14. I'm 36 now. I was recently hospitalized (non smoking related) and the doctor told me he could tell I smoked when he listened to me breath.

I bought a juul last night and as of 5 am this morning I have not had a single cigarette. That's over 9 hours, which is the longest I've gone without while awake in years. Not sure how healthy vaping is long term, but it has to be better than the shit I was putting into my body before.

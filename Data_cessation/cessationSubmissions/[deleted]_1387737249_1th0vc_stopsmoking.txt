I need help with stress and anxiety attacks.

So I've been dipping for close to 5 years, at a clip of about a can a day. I've tried to quit multiple times, with the longest period away being about 7 days. Over the past month or so, I've been exceedingly stressed out due to finals for college/work/etc. Whenever I'm stressed, I tend to become a hypochondriac (as dumb as it seems, even though I know theres nothing wrong it still freaks me out). This time, somehow I've convinced myself that I have throat cancer, even though the only symptoms I have are the exact same things I have every time I get too stressed and have anxiety attacks (muscle tension in the neck, shortness of breath, swollen throat, etc.). Normally, when stuff like this happens, I just put a dip in or smoke a cigarette and I calm down pretty quickly, but now that I'm trying to quit (on day 2 at the moment), I don't know what to do. 

Now that I type it out, it seems extremely dumb, since I know that I'm okay physically, but for some reason I keep having these anxiety attacks that I can't get rid of that are making me want to throw up. I just have no idea what do to keep myself sane so any help any of you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Also, it doesn't help that once I got it in my head that I have a problem in my neck I started constantly feeling my throat for lumps, so now my adam's apple and lymph nodes are sore from constantly rubbing and squeezing them.

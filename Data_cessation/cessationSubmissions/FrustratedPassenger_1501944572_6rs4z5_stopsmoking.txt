First day - so far so good

12 hours into this quit and I'm hanging in there. Of course, I went back to bed and slept in :)

The cravings aren't so bad and there's an awful taste in my mouth. I'm sticking with water right now instead of coffee. Water combats the awful taste. I keep telling myself that the taste in my mouth is my body rejecting the crap I've been forcing on it for how many years. 

I hope to get to know you all

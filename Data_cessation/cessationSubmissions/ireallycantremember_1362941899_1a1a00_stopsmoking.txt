How does it feel to take a deep breath?

I ran for the first time in a VERY  long time (2 years?) today. I used to run, bike, swim, etc, on a regular basis, and honestly, I never really felt out of breath due to smoking. Maybe I just never pushed myself hard enough.

Anyway, I joined a gym today. I ran/walked for about 35 minutes, pushing myself at intervals. I didn't feel out of breath, but I also didn't feel like I could take a deep breath either. I've actually been feeling a bit out of breath a lot lately, which is strange since I have smoked in five months. Does anyone else feel this way? I want a wave of oxygen to knock me off my feet! So far my chest feels the same as it did when I was smoking :(

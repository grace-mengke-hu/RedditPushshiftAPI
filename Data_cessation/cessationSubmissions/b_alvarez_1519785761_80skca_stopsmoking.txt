First clean work day

Hi all, 28 year old here, been smoking for 10 years or so. Have known for about 8 of them that i should quit, and currently starting day 3 completely smokeless. This will also be my first workday without cigarettes, of which i usually run through half a pack while there.

I'm just tired of being a slave to them, but what i feel will be challenging is facing the chaos at work without those little stopgaps every hour or so, where i can pop out, light up, and regroup. I know what i have to do and why, but I'm still nervous, and already vaguely fiending. It's been inspiring reading about all of your successes and struggles, so here i go, wish me luck!

Again Again

Trying to stop again.  I was in a class explaining how medicine works (synapses and receptors) and I thought I could use the new found knowledge to help me.  Knowing exactly whats going on should help me make it through the tough patch into nicotine free zone.  I have been a 1 to 2 pack a day smoker for a decade.

My plan as follows:

-Think about whats happening in my brain when the cravings/ withdrawal symptoms hit.  Ride them out.

-Deal with the mania that's going to happen when I stop because of the depressant side of nicotine.  Understand that it's going to balance out, but it will take time.

-Try to remain verbal and around people.  Sitting alone and thinking about how much I want one is not going to help.  I need to stay active.

-If things get unbearable, I'll take a chew.  I still have some pouches left.  I hate chewing/ spitting, but it's better than what I've done in the past, and that's bumming or buying a new pack of smokes.

It's going to be a challenge, but I've got a pretty active night planned.  Part of it will be spent with a smoker, but there is no easy path to quitting, so I'll make due.   I want to throw some yoga, exercise, and maybe even meditation in there to help and get healthier.

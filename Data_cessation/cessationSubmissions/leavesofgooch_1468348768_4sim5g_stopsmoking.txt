Just about 6 Months

Hi everyone,

Gave up smoking for a New Year's Resolution. Had been smoking for like 5 years or so (I'm 23) and was sick of worrying about every weird lump in my side (had them checked, I'm fine) and constantly being out of breath, my face looking all pock-marked and worn. 

In the past 6 months I have had a total of 3 cigarettes. Two of which were with a friend I had grown up with, who I had not seen in a very long time. Both cigarettes were equally unpleasant, but somehow I felt I had to since it was just something 'we did' when we were younger. 

The third one was in April, at my cousin's lake house in upstate New York. One of my strategies for quitting was that I'd only smoke when I'm upstate. Stupid, I know, but since I was there and a friend had some rollies I decided, "Hey why not?" I couldn't even finish the thing, it tasted like crap. 

Honestly don't know why I'm posting, there's really nothing major to report. Quitting was tough obviously, but since it had been a habit that had only lasted for 5 years (which isn't necessarily short, but it's shorter than some other people on here) and I didn't even like smoking anymore, it just made my throat hurt and my self-esteem suck. Had to kind of get it out there that not smoking has been, on the whole, easier than I expected, and I'm looking forward to being the kind of person who doesn't smoke. 

Thanks for reading.

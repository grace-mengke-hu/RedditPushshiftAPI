Two years quit! Free after 40+ years of smoking!

Today marks two years since I quit smoking cold turkey.  The difference between now and that first day, that first week, that first month! I was shackled to a habit, now I'm unfettered and at peace.  At around 400+ days into my quit the cravings finally started giving way.  

It took a long time to overcome all those decades of programming.  

The hardest part of quitting was de-conditioning my thought processes.  Smokes defined a huge part of my persona and were always there for everything: after morning exercise, with coffee, tea and drinks, reading in a park, sitting on a beach, camping, before eating, after eating, after a shower, while reading, while working, wile driving--they were also my reward, my solace, my old friend--for decades! But the damn things were starting to kill me.  My body couldn't take it much longer.  I figured it was either quit them or they would so quit me. 

I am feeling great these days.  No more coughing, wheezing, chest pains, endless throat clearing, and I've got lots more stamina.  Several of my friends have commented how much healthier I look now. Best of all I have proven to myself that I could achieve a high level of self-mastery.  That's been a great boost to my self-confidence.  

I'm going to be another one to say: if I could quit, anyone can.  I didn't think I could, but I did!

April 14th - My anniversary.

Friends: 31 years ago, April 14, 1984, I became a non-smoker. I smoked from ages 15-23. I started smoking because all the "cool" kids at high school smoked. I continued this nasty habit through my stint in the US Navy. My motivation to quit was the expense. When cigarettes went up to $1 per pack, I decided that was it. 

I quit cold-turkey because that was the only option available. Back then, everybody smoked anywhere (think Mad Men). I was very fortunate to see the light back then, unlike some other addictions I still battle today.

I have nothing but the utmost admiration for all who struggled but finally broke through to the world of non-smokers. You guys are truly awesome! I'm very proud of y'all that quit for new year's...you're kicking ass. I ask you to join me in not smoking today!

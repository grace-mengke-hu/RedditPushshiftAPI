Passed my first smoking dream!

So today will be 2 weeks without cigarettes and last night was my first smoking dream.

I was helping an old lady find something of her's in this big store. I was crawling under a picnic table and found two packs of my old cigarettes.  One was half full and the other one was empty.  At that point I felt a craving to smoke one of them, but somehow I knew better and gave them to the old lady.

I feel like I just proved to my subconscious that I am a non smoker now and it feels great.

That's all, thanks for reading pals.

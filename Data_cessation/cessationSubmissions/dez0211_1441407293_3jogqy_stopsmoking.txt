I hate that smoking is such a big part of my life

About 5 months ago I stopped smoking, I went from 20 cigs/day to zero. I was fine most of the time, only had real urges to smoke when drinking. The only thing that always bothered me was that I thought about smoking every single day. Nothing I couldn't handle, but it just didn't leave my life.

About a month ago I've been on holiday with a few friends, it was pretty much all drinking, they were all smoking, and so I started again too. Just for the holidays, you know how it goes.. After that I smoked only while drinking, then the past few days just a few every day. My reasoning here was, that this would finally help me to let smoking not be such a big thing in my life. Just smoke a few cigs every day and not think about them for the rest of the day. Well, of course it doesn't work, I was always just waiting for the next time I would allow myself to smoke again.

It's stupid, really. I knew it wouldn't work, I did it anyway. I'm stopping now again, because if the thought of smoking has to be a part of my life, at least I can be healthy that way. I think I just needed this rant, thanks for reading.

First few hours.

So, reddit, I'm giving this another go. I made my decision today when I realized that I struggled to play with my nephew(I'm 25 and in relatively good shape besides smoking problems.) It's probably been about 5 hours, and I'm already fighting not to head to the gas station. What is the best advice you can give to someone with very little will power?

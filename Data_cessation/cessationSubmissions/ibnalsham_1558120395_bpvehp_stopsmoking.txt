A new milestone!

I quit smoking in october 2017. Ever since then I still had a smoke every now and then, especially while drinking. This culminated in a full blown relapse last year around this time but i got it back under control before winter. Good weather means I socialize more which leads to smoking. I was worried id start again this time around, but i got obliterated drunk 3 nights in a row and didnt smoke a single drag! i got offered a plenty, too!

Day 3, feeling... irritated.

So day 3 has definitely been the most difficult so far. I can tell my fuse is very short today. I'm not blowing up on people or anything but I have gotten extremely frustrated at little things like getting caught at a red light. I know I'm doing the right thing and holding strong but dang if I'm not just a bummer to be around today. Just checking in to give an update and say thanks again for the support of this community. You guys are helping more than you know.

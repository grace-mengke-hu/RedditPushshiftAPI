When does the excess energy chill the hell out?

After a failed cold turkey, I decided to go the taper route. I’ve cut my nicotine in over half over the past week from 18mg to 8. I’m having racing thoughts, and tons of excess energy, and a tad bit of euphoria but nothing too crazy. My question is when does this calm the hell down? Energy is great but boundless excess nervous energy isn’t fun.

Quitting without becoming a fatty

This may be a common question, but I'm new here and new to Reddit, so my apologies if it is.

I just quit smoking (like... an hour ago) after much anticipation and build-up. I know I'm done, but I'm also not sure how to get through the next few weeks without the normal way I soothe annoying discomfort: food.  I know gaining a few pounds in the long run is totally worth it compared to all of the harm that smoking causes, but I'd really like to not gain any weight. I've noticed many posts mentioning snacking instead of smoking.  I snack enough as it is.
Have you managed to quit and stay svelte?  If so, how??

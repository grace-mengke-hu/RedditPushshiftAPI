Over 24 hours in

I bought a vape yesterday (as an early Christmas present to myself) and as an afterthought I deicded to use it to replace cigarettes. I am currently a little over 24 hours without a smoke. I know vaping isn't the best replacement but it feels so nice knowing I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a day. Has anyone tried to gradually wean themselves off nicotine with vaping? I am planning to gradually lower the nicotine content as I go along. Does anyone have any advice? It would be greatly appreciated.

My new self rule

Ive been smoking for 8 years and I know there are a lot of reasons to quit but I honestly really just enjoy smoking. I just quit for 13 days with the intention of smoking again after i broke my addition but it lead me to being depressed and stopped me from being myself. I decided that i will buy a pack a week. If i end up smoking more than 20 cigarettes in 7 days I will quit for 30 days. This may be harder than quiting cold turkey but i don't want to never smoke. Just wanted to post here to make it official, I'll let you know how it goes.

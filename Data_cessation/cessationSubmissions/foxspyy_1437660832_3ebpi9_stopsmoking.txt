When does the awful pang go away?

It's like a stab deep in my soul. I'm 3 days in without nicotine and the lightheaded feeling is gone. My only withdrawal symptom is these god awful cravings. They come and go, but damn they make me want to punch something. When does it get better? I don't want to feel like this forever. :(

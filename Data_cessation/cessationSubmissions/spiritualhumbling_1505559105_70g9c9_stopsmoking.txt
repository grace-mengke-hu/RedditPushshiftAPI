During one of the worst flues in my 20 years of living, quitting this time feels solid. Throat is in constant pain

Hey y'all. So I got food poisoned on Monday and I remember while in the state of agony (still am) that I proceeded to light up a cigarette which made me feel nauseous and start questioning why on earth am i smoking and why on earth can't I take a break when I have a fever approaching 103F. 

I used to smoke daily (approx 7 cigs a day/if i'm out drinking a whole pack on the weekends) for 1 year and 9 months. At first, smoking was something that I enjoyed until I started losing my breath and the feeling of tightness in my chest. I probably tried to quit 4 times but gave in with the attitude of who the fuck cares anyway. I'm only 20 and I can't do half of the sports that I want to engage in.

I've been smoke free for 5 days now (longest time) and I get cravings here and there but they go away in a few minutes. I've noticed my moods have been going on the erratic side lately, I'm more short tempered. Although I keep coughing up phlegm that's not dark tar like some of you have mentioned here but phlegm that's light brown and clear. How long will I have to endure the crazy bouts of coughing? Any tips on reducing the pain? Herbal remedies? Anything would be appreciated a lot.

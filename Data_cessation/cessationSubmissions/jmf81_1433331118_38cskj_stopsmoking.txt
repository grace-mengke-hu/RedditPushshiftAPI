Day 9 and I feel great(ish)

This has been my 3rd serious attempt to quit smoking. I've done 5 weeks and 4 weeks in the past. Determined to make it third time lucky.  My two failed attempts have came when I had had a few pints. If i can I need to stay away from alcohol for as long as possible! Recently played two games of football (soccer) and the difference in my breathing is so noticeable and will only get better if I can keep away from the cigs. I love not smelling like a fucking ashtray! My sense of smell has returned and it's like a new super power (my farts are fucking disgusting, my poor girlfriend haha). Snacking a good bit on nuts and biscuits but not worried about putting on weight as I'm active enough. Would love to know when or if the cravings ever stop? They're not as strong the last few days but still strong enough to make me have to really restrain myself from going and buying a pack. Only discovered this place after a stop smoking app recommended coming here and reading other peoples stories and to share mine :-)

A small tip, that works well for me. Smoke one or two cigarettes, make sure inhale deep every time, then work out.

This will make you feel absolutely terrible, and for me the sensation of smoking was connected to the feeling I had when I worked out with a fairly big amount of nicotine in my body. That was two weeks ago, I've smoked 2 cigarettes since.

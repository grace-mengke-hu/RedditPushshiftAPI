near 90 days mark, it goes better if you really want

Yep guys, finally I am reaching the 3 months mark and I have just one thing to point out: the mental setting is 80% of the whole process. If you have a strong mind and a still objective to quit smoking because you have internalized how bad and useless is smoking, 99% you can do it. But the real thing is, you have to internalize it,be  aware and conscious of such thing, that smoking is nothing good, it harms your body and stresses you more than not smoking. Once you achieve a still and calm state of mind wrt cigarettes, every craving you will have, it will be defeatable.

Oh and yes, exercise regularly to push your body to eliminate shit from lungs is a thing that I've found it can maintain you focused. Seeing that you are expelling catarrh and other shit is a great motivator to continue to stay clean. 

After nearly 3 months cravings are near absent and when they come, they come and go in a matter of 30 seconds.
Sorry for the wall of text!

TL;DR: your mind can do wonders. stop smoking!

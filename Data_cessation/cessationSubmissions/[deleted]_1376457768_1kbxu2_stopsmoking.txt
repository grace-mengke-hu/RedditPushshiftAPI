Tear soaked murderous rampage.

As a pack a day smoker of over 20 years standing the previous 56 hours have been torturous. I smoked 6 cigarettes last night and have been chewing on the butt of an e-cig almost every waking minute but it isn't enough. Is it all in my head or am I more of an addict than I thought?  I don't know.  Taking up smoking was one of the worst decisions of my life.  Ugh...  

Rant rant rant.

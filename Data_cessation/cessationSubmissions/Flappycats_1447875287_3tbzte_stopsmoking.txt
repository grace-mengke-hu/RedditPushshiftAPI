50 days!! What?!

Hey guys!  Just checked into this sub today and saw I was at 50 days.  Super unreal.  I was a half a pack-a-day smoker for almost 8 years and decided to quit after reading Allen Carr and realizing how trapped I was by smoking.  Although I wouldn't call my quit "easy", I think Carr's Easyway put me in the mindset I needed to quit cold turkey.  Also this subreddit helped tremendously during the first couple weeks of quitting.  Every time I had a bad craving I'd come here and read through all the posts to help remind myself why I wanted to quit and that I wasn't alone in it.

And now as the cravings become rare at day 50, I'm slowly coming to realize all the perks that come with being a non-smoker that I hadn't realized before, especially with winter coming up!  Like seriously, I'm super excited to not go outside 10+ times a day in -20Â° weather!  I have absolutely no idea how I convinced myself that I still enjoyed smoking in the freezing cold year after year.  I am definitely looking forward to being toasty indoors this winter instead of an ice cube with a cancer stick.  

Anyways, thanks for listening to me.  Quitting always seemed like some sort of far-off impossible thing, but I took a spontaneous leap, stuck with it, and am now at day 50.  Anyone can do it!  I've got a long ways to go, I know, but I really think I've got this now.

2 weeks!

I made it 2 weeks today! I was at a wedding this weekend with an open bar and the smokingest wedding party and family I have ever been around. When I popped out to my car to grab some sunflower seeds I was even offered a smoke,which I politely declined. Something I never did on my previous quit, which was over a year long. I must say,I'm pretty proud of myself!

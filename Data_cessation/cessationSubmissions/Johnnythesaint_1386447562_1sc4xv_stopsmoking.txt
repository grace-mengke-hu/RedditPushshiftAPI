Today is day 1

My father died a couple of months ago after a brave battle with lung cancer. He had smoked too long before he quit, and I'm very scared of both quitting, and not quitting. I have been planning this for about a month now.  A friend mentioned about this subreddit, and strangely it does feel like a helpful outlet, just reading everyone's contributions and seeing the folks who have been successful boosts my confidence a bit. I had smoked for 24 years prior to today....wish me luck, and thank you folks

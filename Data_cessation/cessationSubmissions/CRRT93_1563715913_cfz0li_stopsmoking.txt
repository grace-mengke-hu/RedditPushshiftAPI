Trying to quit for the 3rd time

I've been smoking for about 11 years. Ive tried to quit 2 times for reasons that didnt really motivate me like saving money, and it being too cold/hot outside. Now, though I've become a respiratory therapist and I'm trying to quit so I can show all of my early stage COPD patients that it's possible, and their health doesnt have to degrade farther (plus I've seen that COPD is one of the worst possible ways to loose your life). However, for some reason it's harder this time around. I'm only on day two and dying for one. I'd like to know when I can expect cravings to subside, and what I can do as a temporary replacement. Sorry if this is a long post but this is my first time reaching out for assistance and really want this time to be the last time I need to quit.

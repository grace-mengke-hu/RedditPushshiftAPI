25 days no smoking or nicotine

Quitting the act of smoking a cigarette really wasnâ€™t so hard. Giving up nicotine started out really rough and has become easier. I quit for 9 months one time but proceeded to become horribly addicted to nicotine lozenges. The lozenge addiction continued even after I started smoking again. I used the lozenges to smoke less and it sort of worked I cut back a bit on the smoking but also increased my addiction to nicotine. Once I made it through the first 5 days it started getting easier everyday.

When will the cravings stop?!

I have quit smoking now for 109 days.  For the first 2 weeks I had something to look forward to(nicotine out of body, 3 weeks, Month, and 100 days) but every since I hit 100 days I have started having the strongest craving I ever had. Like worst than the first 3 days.  Will the craving ever go away?

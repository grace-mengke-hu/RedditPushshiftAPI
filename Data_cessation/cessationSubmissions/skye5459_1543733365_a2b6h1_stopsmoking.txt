I NEED to quit! Spending almost $400 a week on smokes.

Hi all

I was hoping someone could give me some good coping mechanisms to deal with the cravings. I don’t particularly have a strong will. And need to stop this bullshit of spending over half my wage on filthy smokes. 

I have tried a vape but it didn’t give me the same kind of hit and I would still smoke. 

Thanks in advance

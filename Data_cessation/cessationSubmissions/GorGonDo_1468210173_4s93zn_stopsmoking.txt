I slipped up

So I just slipped up on my 6th day. I was out and picking up some last minute things for a big trip my wife and I are taking and happened to bump into a friend of mine and bummed a smoke off of him. Let me tell you that was not a satisfying feeling. It tasted like crap and I just feel awful from it. 

Its my own fault anyway. I set myself up for success this time around and I didn't follow through with anything that I planned on following. I didn't look through this sub and I didn't post anything to help keep myself accountable. I got myself dehydrated and I have been eating like crap the last 2 days. All things that I should have been avoiding. 

But I am not stopping my quitting. I have come too far and plainly enough I was really enjoying not smoking and I was feeling better overall. It was a dumb mistake but it won't happen again. And just a general thank you to everyone here. You guys/gals are awesome and your support has really helped me and I am going to try and better reciprocate it to everyone here. It sounds odd thanking random people on the internet, but from someone with as much social anxiety that I have, you all have been great. Thanks again and I am not going to mess up again. 

TL:DR: I messed up but I am not going to quit quitting, and thanks.

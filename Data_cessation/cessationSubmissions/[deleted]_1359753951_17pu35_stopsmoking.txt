Just realized as of 3:30 AM this this morning I made it through a whole week smoke free... and I work retail right now!

This Superbowl weekend is going to be tough as I'll be out for both nights but fortunately in my group I was really one of the only smokers so it helps knowing I'm not giving them third-level smoke poisoning as my friend says. She works in a Nicotine research facility and told me not only is there second hand smoke, but people are affected when you smoke, and then sit back down and everyone smells it off you after. I always thought she was being a bit melodramatic (as she'd be the first to admit she is haha) but experienced what they feel this past week in school after the mid class break. 

Knowing I'm not affecting those around me is a HUGE help in quitting.

Losing confidence

Hey guys i'm two months free now and i'm happy that it has been so easy. However two days ago i was out partying and got very drunk for the first time. It got to the point where i didn't care anymore and kept saying that i'd like to have a smoke once again so much... I guess i would have smoked a cigarette at various points in the night if it weren't for my good friend who kept telling me to stop because he knew i would regret it... (it was his pack of cigs that night i didnt have my own of course).

So now after all these smoke free days i lost a little bit of my confidence that smoking is really over for me. Because i wasn't a heavy smoker and because i have a very very strong mindset about smoking right now and it feels so easy to stop. I have absolutely zero cravings and i don't even think about smoking anymore... It felt like it's gone... It already was like this after the initial first two weeks.

I even was drunk a couple of times and still didn't want to smoke anymore... It's weird two days ago i suddenly wanted to smoke badly. I lost the battle within myself two days ago. I only didnt smoke because my friend told me not to. Do you see this as a failure? Would a person with stronger addiction have smoked the cigarette anyways no matter what the friend says?

Good thing is i know i that something like this can never ever happen while being sober... I think so at least

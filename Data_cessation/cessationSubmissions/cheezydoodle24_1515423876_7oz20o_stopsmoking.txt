Giving this another try

So I have once again decided to quit smoking. My 40th birthday is 47 days away and I really really want to quit. I would truly love to give this to myself as a birthday present. I have tried to quit multiple times over the last 19 years and have not been successful for a number of reasons. I am not oblivious to the fact that at the end of the day, it is my fault and my fault alone. Its not like anyone is forcing me to smoke, it's a decision I make. I have decided to use the patch this time around and I am hopeful that I can commit to this, for myself. *fingers crossed* Have a wonderful week, everyone!

Finally decided to give up smoking

As of right now, I am not a smoker anymore. 

I've been lurking on this sub for some time, but wasn't even remotely serious about quitting. 

Today I was told I might have a peptic ulcer. Upon, further research I realised that it may be linked to smoking. Mostly to my unhealthy eating habits. 

My gums are rotting away and my teeth are permanently ugly. 

I was a smoker for the past 5 years of my life. Not anymore. 

I am not a smoker.

A list to keep you motivated To NOT SMOKE

So, I caved nearly a month ago and I haven't been able to get up again. 

It had been four months smoke-free when I caved, and here are some benefits that I lost, and annoying facts I have to deal with again. 

1. I smell horrible!!! All my clothes smell like cigarettes again. 
2. Horrible cigarette smell in house and car. 
3. Dealing with the coldness to go outside and smoke. 
4. Cold hands and feet because of a dicrease of blood circulation. 
5. Less energy
6. Having trouble going up the stairs or walking up a hill (not even mountain, hill ma friends)
7. Spending so much money on cigs
8. Freaking out about going into a meeting because I know it will be at least an hour until my next cig. 
9. Freaking out when running out of cigs. 
10. I smoked old cigarette butts the other night, I felt like a junkie, 
11. Empty packs of cigs everywhere. 
12. The disspointment of falling. 

I know, I know many of you might think right now that you love the smell of cigarette smoke, trust me, you don't!!!! I reak of cigarette smoke right now and I can barely stand myself, and yet addiction has been me by the balls, freazzing my ass smoking outside and keeping windows open to try and help my room smell so bad!!! I know you think you can have JUST ONE, you can't!!! Eventually you go back to your previous fix or even more. 

Stay strong my friends!!! You can do this!!!!!!!!

I hope I get to join all of you again in this slavery-free adventure.

Two years what's up

As of tomorrow I'm two years smoke free, after an eight year addiction. No one in my circles really cares anymore, but I thought I'd share with my original sub that inspired me (under a different username).

I also want to add that months after I quit my brother, and then my father quit smoking. My quit positively impacted two people I love and now we are a smoke free family. If you're just starting out, it's so worth it. Good luck and thank you again ðŸ˜Š

Not had a cig in a few weeks.. and I swear my hearing is better?

Is this just coincidence d'ya think, or have any of you lot experienced this before? I am 100% picking up on layering while listening to music (same earbuds, same Spotify stream quality), can hear things clearer in general (especially outside).  I'm not getting over a bug or anything that would have clogged me up, all I've done is stopped smoking. Sinuses are feeling much better, I don't wake up with a runny nose every morning.. I know the ears/nose and throat are closely linked, but I've had periods where I've gone without a smoke for six months before and not once had my hearing tuned, lol.   


And whether you're on day 0, day 1 or 100 - keep fighting the good fight

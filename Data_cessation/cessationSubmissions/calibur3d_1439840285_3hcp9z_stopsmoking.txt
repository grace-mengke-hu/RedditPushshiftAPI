Coming up on 4 months.

And I don't regret a thing. The first month was hard and I cried the first week (I was drunk and wanted a cigarette but didn't give in). I don't have a desire to smoke anymore when I drink which was the biggest hurdle because they always went hand in hand for me. I do bite my fingernails more than I used to, but I will be tackling that bad habit sometime in the future.  Anyways, I joined this subreddit the same week I gave up smoking and have been lurking since, and finally just wanted to post something. Anyways, keep fighting the good fight everyone.

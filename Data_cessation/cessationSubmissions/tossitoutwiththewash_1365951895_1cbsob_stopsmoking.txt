It happened so quickly...

I quit drinking about a month ago, 35 day sober to be exact.  When I use to drink I would have the occasional smoke but I was never a regular smoker.  Since I've stopped drinking, I have a smoke when I would get a craving for alcohol, maybe 4 smokes a day or so and that held me over for the most part, and that was enough to distract me long enough to subside any alcohol cravings.  But in the last week, I've had a significant jump from 4-5 smokes a day to about 15 a day, and I don't want this upward trend to continue.  I have a vaper kit and that helps sometimes but it's not the same as cigarette.  I'm smoking the way I used to drink, just go all out, why stop at one.  I know that in part, it's just me trying to find a different way to be self destructive, and i don't want to continue smoking, I'd like to quit sooner than later.  I'm not looking for any quick fixes here, I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this.  I just think I needed to get it off my chest.  Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.  Thanks for listening Reddit.

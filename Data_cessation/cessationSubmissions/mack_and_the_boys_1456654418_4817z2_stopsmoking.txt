The Break Up test

Last summer I met a lovely girl and the future was full of plans and hopes and roses and of course it never works out like you hope so the other day we broke up. 102 days ago I quit smoking - partly because of her - I think even my first post on this reddit was QUITTING FOR LOVE or something pompous like that ! Well, if one good thing can come out of the failed relationship, it's that I want to stay quit...it's a test though, because my emotions are still a bit all over the place and it will take a while for them to re-calibrate. Knowing I'm not drowning my sorrows/lungs with smoke is helping though. I feel a lot more mature then I did during my previous couple of break ups in my early 20s.

Just unloading - thanks, and good luck to everyone else on the journey.

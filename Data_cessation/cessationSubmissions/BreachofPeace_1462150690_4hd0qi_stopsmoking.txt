I guess it is common for a Day 2 first post. Here's mine

*Oops, plus I'm new to Reddit, so I don't know how to do things...like create a post, ha ha*

What I meant to say was THANKS to all the folks posting here to share their experience, both highs & lows.  It helps to pop in here during a craving because the discussion in this subreddit reminds me the importance of this progress and emphasizes what a shame it would be to screw it up, what a mistake it is to have even one. And then the craving passes. Beautiful! 

This is where I discovered The Easy Way to Quit by Allen Carr, which you all know is such a helpful tool to make a path. 

I am surprised how easy and fun this is so far. I know there could be difficulty ahead (it's only Day 2), but I'm already enjoying more and more new fresh experiences than I am missing those things. 

For example, I ran 2 miles last Sunday (still as a smoker). My time was 20:00. I ran last night (after having only quit 24 hours). My time was 16:30. Holy crap, you all! People usually work HARD for months just to drop a couple of minutes from their run. I'm not bragging, just pointing put how badly our bodies are begging us to stop, and are just waiting for our response to show us amazing things.

Another example: things smell amazing!! Being Spring, everything smells sweet outside right now, so it's a nice time to actually be able to smell it. I keep taking showers for the enjoyment of smelling like soap. And brushing my teeth and flossing, using mouthwash and all because my breath is not a lost cause...it's pleasant

I'm almost 40 and smoked for 22 years. Does that put me in the "If I can do it, anyone can" category?

Almost fell off the wagon yesterday

Yesterday was a bit difficult. I went to a friend's birthday party, which is a challenge in itself (I'm a *very* introverted person, and large groups of people make me really uncomfortable). But harder than that was being around many people who were smoking. This was the first time since I quit that I was around smokers, and wow, was it hard - the smoke still smells good to me. I actually had to leave after about 90 minutes, because I realized that if I stayed, there was a very high likelihood that I'd end up bumming a smoke off somebody, and we all know how slippery that slope is. 

On the plus side, yesterday marked 5 full days without smoking $39 dollars not spent on cigarettes, and 100 cigarettes not smoked!

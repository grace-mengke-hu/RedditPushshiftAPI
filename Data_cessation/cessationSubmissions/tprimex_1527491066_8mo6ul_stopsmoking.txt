Anyone want to quit because they're not addicted but not quit because they're not addicted?

Maybe I am addicted and I don't want to belittle anyone's struggle. I'm a casual smoker. Not a social smoker but a casual smoker. The reason I started smoking was because my first high school job as a dishwasher you got "smoke breaks" on top of your regular breaks if you were a smoker. I kept up the habit. But I only smoke at work and while driving. I think it's a boredom thing. If I'm home for the weekend I won't smoke at all or if I'm with friends or family I never need to go for a smoke. Just smoking at work and driving I smoke about 2-3 packs a week and winter I smoke 2-3 packs a month.

I think it would be easy to quit. It's unhealthy and its a waste of money. But at the same time I can't imagine what to do on work breaks or what I would do while driving. A big part of not wanting to quit if it's just almost a part of my idenity now. Anyone quit who was just a casual smoker but struggled to quit? What helped you?

Just crossed Day 10

My every attempt to quit smoking had been challenging. I have gone upto 6 months without a smoke and then broke down with one odd cig which I thought "this is fine, I know I have quit, this one is just not the one which will drag me back anyways.. " ... and there it goes with one such cig.. Everytime, I ended up like this.. the next time I tried to stope needed more motivation than before... The last one I have tried and could not go Cold turkey, had to take help from the liquid nicotine e-cigs.. and finally here I go. 10 days with e-cig and no real one.. and today, I m off the hook from the e-cig too. Hope this one holds good for a much longer duration.

What if we had a discussion about anything but cigarettes ? Let's talk about what we like instead of what we want to get rid of !

Ok let's change how things are done here. Because I'm realizing that if we keep talking about smoking or *not* smoking it just feels like torture in the end.

Just the fact of talking to people who are fighting the same battle as you can be *supportive*.

Let's just talk about us a little bit ! What are your passions ? Why do you love your job ? How are doing your children in school ? Everything is allowed. Feel free to share whatever comes to mind !

I went to a party yesterday...

So.. a buddy of mine got engaged and yesterday was their engagement party. There was alcohol, nice food, and a bunch of people smoking. All triggers. 

I'm glad to say that I didn't even have a bad time NOT smoking.
NOT. A. SINGLE. PUFF.

I was so freaking proud of myself and so was my gf :). 

Keep strong everyone!

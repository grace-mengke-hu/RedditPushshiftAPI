For my cake day, for my quit anniversary, I say hello.

I can't say it's been easy, but it's gotten easiER.  The other night I had a dream that I had found a pack that I had stashed, and smoked every last one of them.  I loved it.  I woke up and cursed my scumbag brain.  But it's been a year.  Honestly I think stubbornness is what pulled my through most of it, and support from you fine people and my family helped with the rest.  I have an app on my phone named "Time Since".  I refused to reset that counter to zero.  I've wanted to; but thanks to the supportive people on this subreddit, I didn't have to even through cravings where I saw myself pulling into the convenience store and buying a pack.  So thank you, everyone who's helped me, and to those who are just starting the journey, it can be done, I promise you.  You will go through periods where you feel like crap and your brain will tell you that quitting is not worth going through all the agony.  Don't listen, it will get better.  Even though I gained some weight, this is the healthiest I've felt in years.  Do not hesitate to ask for help.  Thank you. *Steps down from soapbox.*

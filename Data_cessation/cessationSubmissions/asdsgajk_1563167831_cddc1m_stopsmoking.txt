Help me!

I stopped smoking this April. But was only able to do it for a month. Because all my friends are smokers and whenever I'm around I can't resist. I did the same thing last year too. Stopped all of the sudden for a month and then started again. I just can't seem stop for more than a month. Any advice? 

Ps. I can't change my company. I love my friends. I can't live without them.

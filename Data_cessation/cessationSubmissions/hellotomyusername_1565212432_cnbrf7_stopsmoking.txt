Advice for helping significant other quit.

So today I woke up and was approached by my girlfriend who told me she would like to quit vaping (juuling). She has been using her juul for nearly a year now and cannot go 10 minutes without it. She told me she would like to to hold on to it and only offer it to her on occasions when she desperately needs it. I told her that I was proud of her to and make a safe word to use whenever it is a dire emergency and she must use it and I will offer it to her no questions asked. Does this type of method work? Any tips for being supportive but not over doing it in either direction? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

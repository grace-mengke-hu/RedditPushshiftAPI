I'm doing it on January 1

I started smoking at 15.  Off and on for years. Quit for about 4 years at age 26. Started back around 30-31 but didn't smoke much. Quit several more times, once while pregnant, again for six months or so here and there. I have gotten back up to a pack a day. I am 36. It's time to quit for good, one day at a time. I've set the date. January 1.  Already have patches in the house. They helped me before even though my skin is very sensitive to them and they leave burns, I think the burned skin is easier to deal with than any of the likely consequences if I don't endure burned squares of skin for 8-10 weeks. 

Wish me luck. I will be visiting this sub regularly for inspiration and possibly to vent and/or type in all caps about how I hate the universe while I'm enduring the first few weeks. 

I know I can do it with some help and focusing on the reasons to quit.

Thanks for reading.

Checking in, feeling good

I bummed one from work the day after we quit and I didn't really feel bad about it. I didn't feel anything about it. It didn't relieve any stress, it didn't make me want another one, it was just a thing that happened. I feel like I've finally gotten into the right headspace for this.

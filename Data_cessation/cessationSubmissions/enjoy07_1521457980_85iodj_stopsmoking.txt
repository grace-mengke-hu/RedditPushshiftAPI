Yesterday (Day 6) was the worst day for me yet.

I had a migraine that lasted all day. Not only that, but the migraine woke me up in the middle of the night and I broke out into a fever. I got physically ill and couldn’t even keep water down so I couldn’t take any pain killers. Luckily a friend suggested I put an ice pack on the back of my neck. So the fever finally went down long enough for me to nap, wake up, and finally take some meds. Still didn’t cave in and smoke though. Hopefully today is a little better.

Weird taste in mouth after quitting...did this happen to anyone else?

Hey guys (and gals) I'm on day 10, and I'm ALIVE!! I made it through an entire week. It sucked, I cried, I pulled my hair out, I walked my dog about 60 times a day, I took up needlepoint, I even made candy from scratch...just anything to get my mind and hands off of smoking. 

The worst part aside from the cravings, is this new weird taste I have in my mouth. I feel like I can't smell or taste anything at all. And when I do taste something the flavor is off. For example, pizza tasted sour, and an orange tasted bitter. I also have this weird metallic taste in my mouth at all times. Kind of like blood covered nickels. Is that normal? And will this go away?

I know everyone says the best part of quitting is being able to taste food again but for now my tongue just feels fuzzy and my tastebuds are all out of wack.

Anyone else have a similar quit experience?

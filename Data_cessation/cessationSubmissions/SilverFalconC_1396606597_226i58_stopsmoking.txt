Need some serious push to continue on

I'm more than two weeks in and I'm hurting bad. This is the worst my cravings have been. I was around a few smokers tonight and we were all drinking. I actually had a lit cigarette in my hand but not once did I put it up to my lips. I had a mental battle with myself for hours of why I should or shouldn't smoke. Any encouraging words or pieces of advice would help. I am only a two minute walk from the convenience store. This is so tough!

Howdy, guys! Nine months free today!

I just wanted to check back in here to say that today it has been nine months since I had a smoke. All systems are go, except I've put on about 25 pounds that I have to figure out how to lose.

Best of luck to everyone struggling with it, and congratulations to all who have kicked it.

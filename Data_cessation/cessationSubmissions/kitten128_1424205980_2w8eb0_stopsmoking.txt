HELLO!

Hey all, new to this group and have been reading Allen Carr's Easy Way while smoking my last pack of cigarettes. I have 2 chapters left and am done with the smokes. Nervous because I have tried and failed before but this time I have the mantra never another puff and I will be a non smoker. I set my badge for tomorrow, not sure it that works or not but it says it will be ready. I am excited to join your ranks, I hope you'll have me!

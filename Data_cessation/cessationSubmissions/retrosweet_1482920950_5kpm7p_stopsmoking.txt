Will power

I realise I need the will to give up smoking, over the years I have tried several methods and always seem to find a way back. My partner is a heavy smoker too and I know I cannot expect him to agree and quit with me. My parents were heavy smokers and they managed to stop. If my Dad can do it, so can I. I have set my stop date for New Year's Day and will go cold turkey, all the previous times I have used NRT but without willpower these are helpful but ineffective. I will start getting my mind prepared for it and hope this time I am successful, for my health and my kids.

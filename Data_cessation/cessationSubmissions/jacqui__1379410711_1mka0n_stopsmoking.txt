Nightmares when wearing patches

I tend to have bad nightmares when I'm wearing patches. Does anyone know why this is? I've heard of it happening to other people, too.

I tried sleeping without wearing a patch, but when I wake up in the morning I have a throbbing headache and desperately want a cigarette. Anyone have any advice?

Allen Carr says I am now a non-smoker, and I believe him.

I didn't even want that last cigarette. I wanted the one I had last night to be my last one but the fear of going back made me listen and have just one more. I felt guilty and fearful the whole time I smoked it, that it would trick me again. But the fear was different, it wasn't fear that I would never smoke again but fear that I would. But I did it, it's done and now I don't ever have to do it again.

I don't have to smoke. If you're thinking about checking out the book, give it a shot. You, like myself, have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

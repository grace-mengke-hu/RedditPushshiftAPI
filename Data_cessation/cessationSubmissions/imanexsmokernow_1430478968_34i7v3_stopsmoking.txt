I am superior to cigarettes.

I quit smoking. 

People told me create a motivational mantra. Mine is simple: "you can smoke anytime you must." It has become a backhanded challenge for me. I CAN smoke any time I want. But am I so mentally weak that I MUST smoke?

It's been two weeks now. I quit cold turkey. When I got cravings I used my mantra. When the mantra failed, I convinced myself I was stronger than cravings. To rely on tobacco for gratification and creativity is something the weak do. After all, overcoming nicotine is one of the hardest things a person can accomplish. But if I'm strong enough to do it, what *else* can I do?

The arrogance I use is thick. The mental gymnastics I'm able to convince myself with are twisted. But when I doubt my strength I just look forward. I am better. I am better than cigarettes. I'm stronger than nicotine. I don't crave cigarettes. I don't want them. 

They're like an old lover to me now.

Oops I did it again...

I cracked... not under any particular stress or cravings but I was in a large social gathering for the past couple of days and I just felt like smoking, since literally everybody else was.

Bye-bye 18 days streak. Guess I'll have to start over!

Let's hope no one gets married this time :D

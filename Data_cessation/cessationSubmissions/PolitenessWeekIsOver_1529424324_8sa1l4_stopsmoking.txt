Filling up time freed up by not smoking

I started smoking because I moved to a different country and I didn't know anyone or spoke the language here. I've been smoking 6 cigarettes a day for past 2 years (some times more). I decided to quit many times, but gave up after a few days. I'm almost 4 days into my current attempt, I've never gotten past my 8th day. 

I have read on this subreddit that some people I identified after many attempts why they failed, and then they succeeded because they could plan better. I did similar analysis on me and the primary reason I came up with is that without smoking nothing seems as pleasurable. In the past 4 days I did all of the things which smoking prevented me from doing (mostly because of social anxiety and embarrassment over being a smoker). I didn't run away from people I met, I actually talked to my room mates and I am well on my way to bringing myself back to 5k runs.

But none of this feels good. It just all sort of feels bleh. I remember in my last attempt this is why I took the "just one puff", because I wanted to enhance the feeling of happiness over finishing a 5k run after such a long time. I couldn't do the 5k run after that. It all makes logical sense to me but it seems like without smoking I could achieve all the things I want and I wouldn't feel happy. Did anyone go through this? Does it get better?

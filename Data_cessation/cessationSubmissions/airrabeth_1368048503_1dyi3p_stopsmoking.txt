So, I've been trying to quit smoking...

I started Chantix 5 weeks ago, After the 1st week you're supposed to put down your cigarettes all the way, I didn't. I had successfully quit smoking for over 3 years with the assistance of Chantix before, but I did end up smoking into the end of the 2nd week of it.  I figured, it's been a little over a year since I fell off the wagon, I can't afford to keep buying cigarettes and honestly, I'm tired of smoking. I hate going to buy my cigarettes, I hate trying to keep up with my lighters, I hate that I smell like my cigarettes instead of my body sprays/lotions/deodorant. 

And I'm a Mom of 4 beautiful kids who need me around for a long time. The woman who raised me, I've already had to bury because of smoking, I watched her die, slowly, while still smoking with 60% oxygen wearing it 100% of the time. It wasn't pretty and I do not EVER want to be remembered like that. So yes, Quit. This is what I want.

But I'm 5 weeks into this, I've not gotten that receptor block like I got before, where all of a sudden the smell and taste of the cigarettes were so strong it made me sick. I've been with the same Doctor for years, and I don't really want to disappoint her by telling her I'm this far into taking the meds and still haven't quit. I don't know if it's the medications I use for my Bi-polar disorder counter reacting and causing them to just not be as effective or not work at all, or If maybe I need/could up my dose to 3 times a day instead of 2. Because I know once I get through the first week of not smoking it's the "habit" that I'll have to break, not the "need" and I'd still have some left over to help with the minor nicotine craving since there will still be a slight amount there due to the medication and I could step back down to 2 a day as prescribed. Opinions? I know ultimately I should call my Dr. But if I can avoid it, I'd really like to.

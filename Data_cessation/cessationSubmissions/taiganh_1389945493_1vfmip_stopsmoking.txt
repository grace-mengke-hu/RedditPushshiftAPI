Monday is Quit Day. Here's my public commitment.

Hi r/stopsmoking. First of all, you're all awesome. I have so much admiration for what you've done, whether it's been 3 days or 3 years since your last cigarette. This is probably the most tight knit and supportive place I've lurked on reddit. 

So I'm quitting on Monday. I was off the lung lollies for about 3 months last time, after being on about a pack a day for the last 6 years or so. I had some shit going on and I fucked up. 6 months after caving in, I'm really feeling the negative effects coming back. My throat hurts. I can't exercise properly. I can't sleep until I have a cigarette, and even then I wake up in sheets that smell like shit. 

I used Nicorette mints last time and they just didn't take the cravings off. But hell, I quit for three months. If I can do that, then I can do it again. I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow to talk about Champix, and as soon as I tap done, I'm calling Quitline. 

If I fuck up, it's okay. I'll just learn from my mistakes and keep focused. I'm gonna do it, do it right, and beat this awful addiction that pushes people from me, weakens me, and will eventually kill me in the most degrading and painful ways. 

The first paragraph of this post was for you guys, and so is this one. I'm posting here because I need you to hold me to this. I'm posting this here because I want to be accountable for my mistakes if I don't quit. If I say I'll do it openly and publicly, I will be ashamed of myself for failure, and I won't live it down. 

These things taste like shit anyway. Bring on Monday.

So long and thanks for all the fish.

Seriously.  You guys have been my rock for the past two months....but a this point the only time I crave nicotine is when I see these posts so I gotta tune out for a bit.   I'll be back in a couple weeks or months to give back to the community who has given me a smoke free life I never thought was possible.  


Thanks again.   You have helped more than I ever thought possible.

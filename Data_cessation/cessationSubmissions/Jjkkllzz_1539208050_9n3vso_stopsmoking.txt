Well, here we go again.

I had quit smoking for over four months. I was so proud of myself. I was exercising daily and life was good. I had stress but I was dealing with it without nicotine. I thought I was done with nicotine forever. But I’ve been smoking for the last five days. I have some unmedicated mental health issues (bipolar disease) and after a bad breakup I had a mental breakdown. I randomly found a box in my closet that had 3 cigarettes in it and although I knew better, I told myself I would smoke them to get through these panic attacks and then never buy more. But we all know how that goes. I thought that that first cigarette would be horrible, but it was oddly satisfying and here I am five packs later. But I’m feeling better and I’m going to give it another go. Alan Carr’s book and this sub were so helpful for me before and I think that doing the same thing in combination with getting help for my mental health issues (doctors appt coming up), I may have a shot this time. This sub was a lifesaver for me before. Thanks for being here. I will reset my timer tomorrow.

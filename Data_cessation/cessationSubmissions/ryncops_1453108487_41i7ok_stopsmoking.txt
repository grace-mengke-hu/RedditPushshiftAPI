Arguments in my head, to quit or not to quit.

Hi! So, I decided I was gonna stop smoking, starting today. So far so good, haven't smoked , but I kinda crave a cigarette. My brain keeps argumenting on how I shouldn't stop smoking... it's weird how nicotine makes you lie to yourself. Trying to resist the craving by focusing on other things and using this subreddit as a journal and a hangout. Hope I'll get over this day, that would be awesome.

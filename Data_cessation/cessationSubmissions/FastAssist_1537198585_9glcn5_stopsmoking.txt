Two weeks now back to square one

Hey Everyone,

I quit smoking and lasted about two weeks and then ended up breaking down and buying a pack. I am so incredibly disappointed in myself. I was honestly surprised that the cravings lasted as long as they did. When did you find they started to go away? I figured after a week I would stop thinking about it or at least stop obsessing over it, but no luck.

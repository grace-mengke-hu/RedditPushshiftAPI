Having troubles

I'm on day 36 now.  

Frankly, I'm tired of quitting smoking. The honeymoon's over. The first month felt like a struggle and it was kind of fun in a weird way to battle the addiction. 

Now I'm just tired of the constant background thoughts urging me to smoke. Starting to wear me down.  

I guess it's good that I'm posting about it rather than going to the gas station.

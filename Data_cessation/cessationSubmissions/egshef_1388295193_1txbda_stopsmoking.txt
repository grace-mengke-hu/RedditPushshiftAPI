A few accomplishments and questions!

Accomplishments:

-stopped smoking during a stressful time of year (holidays, end of semester).

-didn't cave despite a friend offering me a cig

-had my boyfriend keep an eye on me and not let me buy a pack when I was really down and wanted it.

-broke habit of smoking while playing video games

-feel really, 100% better.

-almost 10 days clean, and motivated ! 

Questions:

-Will hookah effect my progress? I really like it but I figure that it's better to avoid nicotine?

-When will the insomnia go away? I have a lot of trouble sleeping now and I'd rather not have it continue like this for a while. 

Thanks to everyone here! This is a huge motivation and I'm so glad I'm taking the right step to breaking this addiction.

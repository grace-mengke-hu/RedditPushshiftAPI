Thank you.

18 days. The longest I've gone without nicotine since I started smoking. I got close last year, but a bad breakup with my ex threw me back off the wagon.

I actually ran into her while drunk last night. Depressed and inebriated as I was in the aftermath, though, I didn't go and buy a pack. I think I'm genuinely free, and I have this sub to thank for it.

So really. Thank you.

Not for myself but how do you get someone to quit smoking?

My mom has been smoking for about 30 years, with no signs to stop. She fully knows the consequences of smoking (who doesn't) but cites her grandmother, who was a heavy smoker and lived well into her eighties, as to why she'll be okay. Even when her doctor told her to stop, she says "I have no plans to stop smoking." Problem with her is that she gets angry whenever me or my dad brings up smoking and gets defensive. Meanwhile, she's coughing like she has pneumonia...

Is there any way to help her? Have you guys encountered an ex-smoker who used to be very defensive about it but ended up quitting somehow?

Smoking on TV and in movies...

My cravings have subsided for the most part. It's been 15 days since my last, and before that I had already cut down to one per day or two. I still have small cravings after I eat, when I have coffee, or when I drink. 

The worst cravings are when I see people smoke in TV or movies... Especially when they take one long beautiful drag of a cigarette. What do you guys do to combat that? I know I shouldn't romanticize it but that's what it looks like and feels like when I see it.

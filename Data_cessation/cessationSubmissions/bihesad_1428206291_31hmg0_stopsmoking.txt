Is it smart to not finish nicoderm program?

Finished 4 weeks 24 hours 21mg Patches. Started 5th week wearing 21mg patch 16 hours a day. Halfway through I just stopped putting them on in the mornings. I'm having no cravings or anything, is this normal? I really don't want to relapse so any advice is appreciated.

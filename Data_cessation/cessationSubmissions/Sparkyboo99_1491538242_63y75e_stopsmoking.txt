Day 1 tomorrow!

I'm 39, pretty much smoked all my adult life, although have quit many times, my longest stretch being almost 6 months....often I've gotten to 30 or 60 days, then start again slowly, and back up again. Anyway, that was then. I just poured water on my pack and tomorrow I have a busy day so that's good.  I'm praying this time it sticks, I'm so sick of the smell and the damage I'm doing to my body. I want to have whiter teeth and better skin and avoid the smokers cough / voice that will inevitably come if I keep this up.  How did this youthful indiscretion become a middle age habit?  I'm ashamed to go into work or anywhere to meet friends, etc, smelling like an ashtray.  I'm also embarrassed to have any of my neighbors see me standing in my garage or outside smoking alone, getting my nicotine fix like an addict.  I'm wondering if I should call my doc for a chantix prescription.  Thing is, I'm really good at making it 2-4 days, or even weeks, but then I meet up with my smoker friends and give in.  Or I let my mind trick me into thinking I have to have one when I'm stressed or lonely at night (which is what happened to me this week after 3 days of not smoking.). After 72 hours the nicotine is supposed to be gone from our bodies, right? so I am not sure I need to take chantix, I just have to not give into the mind f&ck of addiction...thanks Reddit peeps:)

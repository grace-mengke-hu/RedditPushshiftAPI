Time occupation suggestions?

Hi all,

I set my quit date for Sunday the 18th of this month after finally downloading smoke-free. I'm looking for things to help me not want to smoke when I basically have nothing to do. I'm a work at home mom and I've got a couple of things like playing with my kid... But in reality there's a lot of downtime aside from my work and my kid that I know I'm going to need to fill.

So that being said is there anything that you have found that really works for you in those moments of utter boredom?

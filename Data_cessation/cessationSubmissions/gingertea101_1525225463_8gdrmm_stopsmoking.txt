Just want to let you guys know, there's a medication that helps stop smoking.

It's been 4 days now and I had exactly 6 mild cravings. The medication is called Bupropiona and it's prescribed by a doctor. When I went to see the Pneumologist I told him I really wanted to stop smoking but due to PTSD and pretty much not doing almost anything (no distractions) it was HARD. He then prescribed me these pills which are mild antidepressants originally but today they use it mainly for quitting. Apparently what it does is feeding your dopamine receptors which the cigarettes would, so your cravings ain't that bad. You can also smoke while starting the treatment because the medication takes 20 days to start working effectively. I've been taking it for 18 days and I started to smoke less already in tge third day. There been days that I got up to go out for a smoke but I *legit didn't wanted to*. Just a &gt;meh&gt; feeling towards smoking. Now, as I said in the beginning, it has been 4 days and **I don't miss/want to smoke at all**. No crazy unbearable anxiety. No &gt;distracting exercises&gt;, no nothing. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about it.  

Oh, the main reason I quit: it was giving me stomach ulcers so there's that.

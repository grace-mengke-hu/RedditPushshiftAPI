I am on day 39 and there is some stuff with this i haven't expected

I smoked for 25 years. almost 2 packs a day at the end but not always that heavily. I am not sure who outlined what happens when you quit but they all almost say the same thing and my experience is they are not accurate.  
I am still having some withdrawal now but it is a little better every day. manageable... 
1. dumness. not being able to formulate  a thought.. this went on until a couple of days ago. about 35 days
2. dizziness- mostly gone after 36 days
3. sinus clearing themselves - still
4. did not cough but back of teeth felt fuzzy and bad taste in nose. (4 weeks)
5. withdrawal starts eating me at around 11 am and doesn't quit until 3 pm. comes back before bed (getting shorter now starting a couple of days ago)
6. tiredness (feeling better starting today)
7. not being able to sleep through the night (still)
8. shortness of breath. this started a couple of days ago. just a couple times a day. i actually didnt have this issue while smoking. i even ran and biked weirdly enough
9. extreme hunger and weakness when hungry (about a month) 

people it seems this is a long haul. The 'out of your system' in 10 days is nonsense. gear down, get pissed off and realise that the only thing the tobacco industry has sold you is addiction. fuck them and Good luck.

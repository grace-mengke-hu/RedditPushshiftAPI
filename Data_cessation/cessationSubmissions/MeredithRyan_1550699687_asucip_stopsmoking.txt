Was cleaning the snow off of my rental car and the trash. (Looks like my actual car back home in Colorado 🤣). Came across two empty packs of camels. Well one empty pack and 1 lone cigarette. I’m on business for 3 and a half months in Maryland and in a hotel. So I grabbed a hold of the trash and the smoke and went to the hotels ashtray where I smoked for a month before I quit. Broke it in half, threw it in the trash and went to my room. Onward with my day!!! Not tempted to smell it or consider a single puff 🤷🏻‍♀️. I know when I wake up I’ll be at a week smoke free. 🤜🏼

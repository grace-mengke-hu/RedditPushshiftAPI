Worried that I might relapse if I go back to drinking

I quit smoking and stopped drinking at the start of the new year. I rarely get cravings anymore, but when I do, they don't last for more than a minute or 2! I think the one thing that has really truly helped me quit is my abstinence from alcohol for this period of time as well. I would often buy packs when I drank, but since I haven't been drinking, I don't have the urge to buy packs on the weekend, or the week. 

I wasn't planning on continuing to abstain from alcohol after the month is up, but I have a feeling that I might be more prone to cravings. Does anybody have any general advice for how to deal with this? I know, I could keep abstaining from alcohol but I don't want to.

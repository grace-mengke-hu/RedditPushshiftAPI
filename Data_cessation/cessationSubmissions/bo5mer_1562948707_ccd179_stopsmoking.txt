How do you stay smoke free ?

Hello people , I have a big issue , quitting cigarettes was never a problem for me i can quit , but my problem is the psychological addiction because after like 2 or 3 months I forget all the negative feelings i've had and  start missing the cigarettes and the feeling of inhaling the smoke ( when it feels good cuz most of time feels shitty ) ... how do you keep " the hate and the reality " of cigarettes in mind ? how do you stay smoke free ?

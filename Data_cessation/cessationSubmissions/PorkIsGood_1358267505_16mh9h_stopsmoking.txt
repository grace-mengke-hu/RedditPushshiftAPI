I forgot I had quit.

It's been so long that I forgot I quit smoking smoking. I was out with a few friends and I was getting flirty with one of them that I've fancied when one of the other friends got up to go outside to smoke. The lady I was flirting with mentioned how she had quit a few years ago and how glad she did. That is when I remembered that I had too. It's rough at first but it gets easier day by day. Go out and do things, live your life because smoking will sure as shit take your life from you.

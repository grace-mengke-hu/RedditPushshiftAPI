Today I reset my badge

I was very confident that I wouldn't smoke again, 83 days went past, had plenty of other opportunities to smoke, but didn't. But saturday came, everyone was smoking and I wanted one. There was no need, I wasn't having a bad time, I just wanted one. Am I dissapointed? No, not really. This was my first real quit attempt and i'm glad I went 83 days, cold turkey. So, here we go again. I have a feeling, i'll be just fine. :) but I think i'll most likely be lurking around here again! 

I should also add that I've had about 10 cigs.

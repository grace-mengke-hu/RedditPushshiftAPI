Need ideas with what to do on breaks, on which I'd usually smoke

In our school we have 9 classes a day, each lasting 45 minutes and with 5 minutes between each one of them.

It's a time when around ~200 people come out for a smoke, and I used to be one of them. I quit this sunday, but didn't go to school yet, for I have sprained my ankle.

The main problem is that all my friends smoke, and for three years already, I wen't for a smoke every 45 minutes.

So any idea regarding what to do is welcome. I've considered simply not going outside, but I know I'd be dragged out by friends; eating while everyone else smokes, but I can't afford to eat 9 times a day (and it's unhealthy); just talking with them and not smoking, but I know I'd relapse the first day. The most logical thing would probably be to get an electronic cigarette, don't you think?

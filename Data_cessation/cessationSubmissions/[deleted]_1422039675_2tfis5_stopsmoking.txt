How to convince parents to stop smoking?

Hi.

so I don't smoke myself but both my parents do. They are divorced and i live together with my mum and stepdad. 
So anyways, my mum has smoked since I can remember and probably even longer (+25 yrs), she smokes around 1 pack per day.

I feel so powerless, I know that this is an addiction so I gave her a christmas gift which was supposedly to make quitting easier. 
It was an E-Cigarette, I bought different flavors with and without Nicotine. She was very hesitant to even try it out and it needed a lot of convincing. Eventually she did and I thought this is a HUGE step for her.

Fast forward, a month later she is still smoking her cigs and occasionally my gift. Did I actually make her problem worse? It seems she now gets even more Nicotine in her body! 
Also she seems to completely forget at times where she put the E-Cig  and I have to constantly search it for her.

Now as its winter she smokes inside all the time and even gets angry when I open the windows to let in fresh air. This is troublesome because not only I'm worried about her but also about the rest of my family and myself. Who wants to passive smoke anyways? 

So what can I do in this situation. I appreciate any help!

Sorry for my english, not my native language.

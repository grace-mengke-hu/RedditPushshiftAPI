Today is a bit of a struggle

I'm driving from Pennsylvania to Illinois today, and this is going to be the first time I'll have been in a car for over 30 minutes at a time since I quit. I don't know why being in a car for a long period is making me want one but I want one. Though I just did stop at a gas station, buy a drink, and not buy cigs.

Edit:I made it!

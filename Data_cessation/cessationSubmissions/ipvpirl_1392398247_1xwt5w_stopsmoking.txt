Quit smoking last night. Today was pretty challenging.

Been smoking about a pack a day for the past four years. Had my last cigarette officially about 24 hours ago. The cravings lasted for about fifteen minutes today (I started to time them after the morning) before they went away. I blasted music and sang along (I drive all day) until I didn't think about it anymore. After meals were pretty rough. But yay! I can sort of smell again! Hoping tomorrow will be just as successful.

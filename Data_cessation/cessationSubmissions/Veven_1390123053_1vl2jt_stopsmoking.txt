My biggest challenge

A friend of mine invited me to his 2 day birthday party 3 days ago. There were 15 people in total and we were in a cool cozy cabin up in the woods not far from my city. Basically of these 15 people there there were only 3 people who didn't smoke (including me). I had some major cravings there.
I was on the verge of asking for a cigarette but I though if I do that all these days of hard work will go down the drain. There were people who were supporting me not to smoke and believed in me (including you wonderful people <3).And for my sake and theirs I didn't light a single cigarette for those 2 days. I am so proud of myself! Stay strong everyone!

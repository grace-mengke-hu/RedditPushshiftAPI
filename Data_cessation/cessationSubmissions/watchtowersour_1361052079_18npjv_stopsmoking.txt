Forgot that I used to be a smoker! 

I constantly feel like I conquered something, I just can't seem to remember what it was. This sub was my go-to spot for cravings, couldn't have done it without y'all. To all those early on in their cycle, anything worth it is going to be tough, so keep at it! May you be granted the strength to continue on in your quest!

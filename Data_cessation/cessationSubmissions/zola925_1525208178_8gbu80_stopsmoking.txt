Please help. Away to try cold turkey tomorrow morning and I want to stick it.

It's 9.53pm. I have my last cigarette rolled and I've binned the rest. I've made my list of why I want to quit. I've been smoking for 13 years and I'm only 26 next week and can feel it affecting my health. I am determined tomorrow is the day I'm going to stop. I'm going to have my last cigarette shortly and go to bed. Please can you reply with your own story, advice or encouragement and I'll find it first thing in the morning when I wake up. My morning cig will be the hardest to quit. Really appreciate it guys. I want to do this. 

Thanks,

Ryan

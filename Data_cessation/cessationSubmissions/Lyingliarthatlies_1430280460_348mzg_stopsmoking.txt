When I wanted to quit smoking, the smell from my hands made me crave more. I started smoking with a throwaway glove and actually started smoking less.

As the title says, when you smoke, put on a throwaway rubber glove. You can buy them in boxes of 100. They're good for multiple uses. 

Anyway, my hand always smelled very strongly of cigarettes. I started using gloves. Looked weird but no smell. After a while, my cravings subsided. I guess the smell of my hand was a trigger. 

Hope this works for someone!

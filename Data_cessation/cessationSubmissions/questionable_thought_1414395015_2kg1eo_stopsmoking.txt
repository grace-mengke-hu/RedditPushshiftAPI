I have been trying to quite for a few months now. I have gone without for a few weeks but started again.

I have been smoking off and on for about seven years now. I stop smoking for a year but picked it up again. I have done it before so I know it isn't impossible. it is hard that I have a stressful job and I want to smoke every break I get. I usually only smoke during work or when I am drinking.  I thought about bringing in my gameboy for my breaks so I can focus on that but it is hard when most my coworkers smoke as well. I tried downloading the smokefree app and my IOS was too old. I'm just looking for advice on what tricks work for all of you. I know most of it is perseverance but I am sure there is something that helps you get through it, especially the first few weeks.

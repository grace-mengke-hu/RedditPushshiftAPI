First day... I wanna succeed!

Three weeks ago I set my date and that's today! No more cigs for me from now on! It's gonna be hard and I've had a few unsuccesful attempts... I wanna thank you guys cause browsing this subreddit was really motivating and urged me to do this! I'm really going for it and keep lurking around here when having hard times. I am worried I won't succeed and my willpower will be tested... Few, here we go!

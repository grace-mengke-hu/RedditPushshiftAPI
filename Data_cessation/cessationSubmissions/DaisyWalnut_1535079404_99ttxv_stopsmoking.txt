Didnâ€™t mean to drink quite this much but...

Right posted on here a couple of days ago, worries about this weekend with my smoking family. Still worried, but went out with a few friends from the city Iâ€™m currently living in. They are all non-smokers luckily. drank more than I meant to (was worried about relapsing when drunk) but didnâ€™t smoke! Was craving it lot but didnâ€™t give in! My first night out without fags in ages and didnâ€™t miss anything, in fact I think I had more fun as was inside dancing the whole night rather than wasting half the night out in the smoking area.

So pleased ðŸ˜Š

Started smoking again 5 months ago after 3 years smoke free. I plan to start the patch Monday. I'm nervous and would love advice/tips.

Something about quitting this time feels... not as easy before. Previously, I has a cancer scare and I was just DONE. Now I'm dealing with my long term boyfriend moving away to Hawaii for a job, I've been displaced from my house due to a tree falling on it, and I just feel more stressed than usual. However, I want to stop. I'm just... Scared of failure maybe?? I'm so disappointed I started back in the first place. 

Any advice/tips? 

Thanks!

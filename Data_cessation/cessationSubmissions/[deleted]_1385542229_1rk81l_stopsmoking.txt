I'm gonna do it.

I've been wanting to quit every day for the last 3 months, before that I **did** manage to quit for 3 months but then got drunk, bought a pack, you know how it is.

I keep making excuses for myself, such as me going to stay with some good friends 9 days from now, all of who smoke. If I don't do it now I wont do it then.

My girlfriends going away for 5 days tomorrow and I think that now's the best time to do it, at least she won't be here for me to get mad at for no reason at all. I do work 7/10 hour shifts every day for the next 4 days though and I'm extremely worried about being an asshole to the customers and other staff, and I work it a cafe and I'm on my feet all day so that's gonna be the hardest part.

Gonna have my last few smokes tonight. Don't know why I'm posting this here, maybe telling some random people will help me.

Is it okay for me to say I quit and smoke one cigarette per day?

Do I go at my own pace? Is having one cigarette a day the same as quitting? I don't want to go cold turkey because I don't think I can handle the pressure. But isn't there a better way of stopping other than going cold turkey? I know it's the best way to quit. I feel ashamed I told my SO I quit and then smoked in front of them, today I smoked after day 1 of bliss and complete motivation. Is it ok to smoke just one cigarette a day? Or go cold turkey?

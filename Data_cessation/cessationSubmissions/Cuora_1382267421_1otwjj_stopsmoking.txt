Day 8 or 9, just started using an e cigarette, feeling good about my choice, what does r/stopsmoking think?

I quit about a week ago from a really deep smoking addiction. Although I was expecting a tedious journey, I found quitting to be fairly straight forward. I used nicotine gum during the first few days - about 3-5 pieces a day. The last 2 days I have been naturally going off gum and have not had any. 

I did find that I missed the sensation of smoking, so I bought an e cigarette (an eGo  c twist, CE5) and have been vaping away for the last 24 hours. Ive found that is a perfect thing for after work when I need my de stress cigarette. 

I have a tobacco flavour e juice with nicotine,  however after 8 or 9 days smoke free the flavour of the tobacco is really gross and I cant feel the nicotine, so I have been puffing on vanilla flavour with no nicotine instead. 

I am 99.9 percent sure I will never have a cigarette again and the e cigarette has really sealed the deal on this one (my reaction to my first time vaping yesterday was "why was I wasting all that time smoking disgusting tobacco when I could have been smoking a pie?")

How does r stop smoking feel about my choices? Im feeling great about things, however it would be interesting to hear from people that have or have not tried relacement therapy, how did it go and did it actually help you lose the habit, or did it just change it?

R/stopsmoking has been instrumental in my quitting journey. You guys are amazing! I'd like those that are consodering quitting to know that anything is achievable with goals and a community like this. Thankyou guys!

One cig = falling off the wagon?

Around 40 days ago I quit smoking with near complete ease. I slipped around two weeks in during a serious drunken night where my judgement took a serious lapse and I had a cigarette. I didn't really feel like that one cig "reset" the addiction or anything like that, so I kept my streak going and still maintained that I had quit on the original date. I felt guilty as hell but I continued for nearly four weeks more without smoking and the guilt faded sometime within that period, as I was sure that my path was still set and my desire to smoke remained quite minimal. 

Now fast forward to tonight. Of course another drunken night, and a concert one at that. Pair it with the fact that I went with my smoker friend. I slipped. I smoked a cigarette and had one puff of a second one. It wasn't enjoyable. Quite horrid if anything. But I suppose that's not the point. I still smoked. 

I'm about to go to bed knowing that I smoked a second time, and I'm more hesitant now about telling myself that I am still holding true to my original quit date (around 40 days ago). Especially since Allen Carr's philosophy aided me. It makes me feel like I'm doing this "wrong" and that I technically haven't quit if I'm still having these lapses. I don't plan on smoking again, but is it fair to tell myself that I've been quit for 40 days still? To be honest, my "streak" is a big motivator for me. So if I feel like I'm back at day 1, it just feels like a serious blow to the whole process. 

Any opinions would be helpful.

Edit: I'm sure many people are aware of the health benefits that come with prolonged smoking abstinence, and there are many apps that keep track of this. Can anyone shed light on how having one cigarette might affect these health and addiction milestones? (does it reset them completely, not at all, etc.)

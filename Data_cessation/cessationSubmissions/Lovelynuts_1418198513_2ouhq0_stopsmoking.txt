I need your help /r/stopsmoking!!

I want to quit smoking so bad. I had quit for three years at one point and took it back up again. Then I quit again, even started running but injured myself doing a 10k before I was ready. That was June this year. The injury put me out of action for 6 weeks. I stopped running, stopped going to the gym and, eventually, started smoking again.

Both times I have quit using Champix, but unfortunately due to the PBS scheme in my country I can only get them on the cheap once every 12 months. Right now I cant afford to pay full price.
I've talked to my wife, who also smokes. She has clearly stated that she has no intention of quitting and said that she doesn't really want me to quit or she will feel she has to. I even asked her to just go and get the Champix script in her name for me to take and she refused.

This makes it hard. The only place I smoke is at home and with her smoking too, I have little chance of quitting cold turkey without support from somewhere.
I don't want to use nicotine replacement, because I don't really see the point in just replacing the nicotine from a cigarette with a patch or the like.

So, seeing all of the people who get inspired by this sub, I'm asking for advice and suggestions on getting over this seeming mountain that is nicotine addiction. Please help!

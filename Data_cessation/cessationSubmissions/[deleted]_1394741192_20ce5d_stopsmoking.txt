Need some Advice

my boyfriend smokes occasionally.  I am worried that his habit will spiral into an addiction and I don't want to watch his health deteriorate.  He is 19 so hasn't smoked for that long.  I approached him about it two days ago and I think I went overboard in sharing my concern and my personal experiences.  I watch several aunts and uncles die from cancer because of smoking.  I watched their health deteriorate and their inability to quit.  I don't want this to happen to him.  After confronting him amount my concerns are relationship has become very strained the last couple of days.  I am not sure what to do about him at this point.  I do love him, but I can't stand the thought of him playing on such a slippery slope.  What can I do?

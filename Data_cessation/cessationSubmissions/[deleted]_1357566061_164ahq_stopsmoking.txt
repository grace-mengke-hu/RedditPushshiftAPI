Insomnia, shortness of breath, coughing and other symptoms? 

Hi!

I am never smoking again. Or at least, that's what I want. And I usually get what I want. I started smoking 'properly' when I was 17. I'm now 26. I didn't smoke much, usually about five cigarettes a day. Beer changed everything though, and on a good night out, I could easily smoke a pack. 

I want to stop because it doesn't fit my otherwise healthy lifestyle, and it costs way too much. 

I'm having a bit of a hard time, though. I never tried this before. This is my first time quitting, and I'm not sure what to expect. 

Last night, I couldn't fall asleep. Not because I kept thinking about smoking, so I'm not sure how this is related. I dozed off a couple of times, and had a terrible nightmare, but overall I was more awake than not. The good news is that I woke up feeling pretty fit anyway. Did anyone else experience insomnia? How long did it last? Any tips?  

I also feel a shortness of breath, almost like I'm anxious. It's unfair. I stop smoking, and get trouble breathing. On top of that, I feel like I'm developing a nasty cough. 

Since this is my first try, I'd like to know what to expect, especially the positive aspects. Can you help me out?

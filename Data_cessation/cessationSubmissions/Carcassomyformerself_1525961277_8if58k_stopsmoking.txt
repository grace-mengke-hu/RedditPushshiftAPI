Day 1 - Cannabis Sobriety.

I don't know if I'm supposed to post like this but I wanted to get it on the record somewhere that I no longer want to identify as a smoker.  I don't plan to "quit for the rest of my life, never again," black and white, absolutism, etc. are not effective in my reality.

But making the shift in identity is huge, and it has worked for me in the past (with cigarettes).  I have been in the mindset for a while now that I would give it a break, smoke less, etc.  It never really works that well.  So I think a full commitment to a lifestyle in which I do not identify as someone who smokes weed every day (and who needs to, or else...) may garner some success.

I do not think weed is bad, and everyone has different things happening inside their bodies at different points in their life.  It just happens to not be the greatest thing for me at the moment.  It certainly is not deleterious, but I do feel my potential is being slowly sapped away, and I am missing out on some meaningful experiences, especially in my relationships.  I feel I am losing focus, and losing touch with people.  I cannot handle life and deal with the world without feeling like I'm being dragged down.

I want to face the world bold with the confidence to tackle obstacles and feel like I am growing from accomplishing goals, not feel like everything is slowly taking my life away.

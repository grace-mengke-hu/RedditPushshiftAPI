Thank you so much /r/stopsmoking ////my story

So, I've been a long time lurker of this forum. I quit dipping 36 days ago (not smoking but close enough and not a lot of people post on /r/stopdipping). After the first week or so, I really began to feel better. I hardly thought about getting a dip or having one in. If I did, I'd shrug it off and wait the few minutes till the craving was gone. With that being said, I would not have made it this far without r/stopsmoking.

Anyways, my story from today. On my drive home from work I was thinking how great it would be to get home, have a dip, and do X Y and Z. It would make those activities so much more enjoyable and relaxing. It took me about a minute to realize that I was just rationalizing those thoughts. A can of skoal will do nothing for me but feed my nicotine hunger. Then I said to myself, "well it'll just be one can". But I remember reading on this forum a few days ago about how bad it would feel to wake up the next morning and start from day 1 all over again. I began to think about how gruesome those first 3 days were. Did I really want to go back to that? Did I really want to succumb to nicotine again? It took almost everything in me plus the knowledge I've gained from everyone on this forum to say, "NO, not this time you son of a bitch." and drove past the gas station and home. Today hit me like a truck. It blind sided me when I thought the worse was gone; if I had been weaker I could have cracked.

So, Thank You. Thank You so much. I would not be at day 36, or as knowledgeable and willing to quit without all of you.

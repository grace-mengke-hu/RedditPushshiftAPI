I need to be done

I have a day and a half right now and it is not fun in the slightest.  The issue is that my SO is not going to quit and is a pack a day smoker.  Fortunately we don't live together so I don't have to be around smoking when I am not around her.  I'm just looking for some input from others who have been though the same thing when they started out.  

Thanks.

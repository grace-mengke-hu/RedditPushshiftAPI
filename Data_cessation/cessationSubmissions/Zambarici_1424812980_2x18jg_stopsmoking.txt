50 shades of non smoking

I just want to tell the world that it's been 50 days since I stopped smoking and even though some of them were not that good, some were quite awful, it's totally worth it. I remember the first days, how I used to envy everyone with a higher badge than mine, but that exact thing kept me going. I thought that it would be nice to have a 7 days badge, than a 14, a 20, 30 and so on... until I stopped counting and now I have a nice 50 days badge. Hang in there, it will get better. Let's not smoke today.

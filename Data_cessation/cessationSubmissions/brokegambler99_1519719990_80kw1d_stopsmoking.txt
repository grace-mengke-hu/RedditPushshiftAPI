Hair test for nicotine?

I️ quit smoking a year ago. Tonight I had two cigarettes (I️ know I️ know). My question is if I️ have a hair test to test for nicotine in the next 2 weeks, would I️ pass? 

Prior to tonight I️ hadn’t had any nicotine in over a year. 

Sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask, I️ googled it and it said up to a year so I️ was curious if anyone had any experience. 

Thanks!

Breaking my 31 year old habit ...

Hi, I've been lurking for a couple of days, but am ready to come out now! I'm on Day 5 of my quit - I'm using an e-cigarette, so not braving the cold turkey approach!  I've been a 20 a day girl for 31 years and just decided to quit on Monday.

It's going really well, obvs the e-cig is taking the edge off of the cravings ... but I'm so happy that I finally feel strong & able to kick the habit. I'm hoping the e-cig will be a stepping stone & I can kick the whole crappy habit into touch one day.  

I've been reading lots of your posts & have found lots of inspiration & motivation, just wanted to say thank you & good luck to all you quitters!

I like cigars and may be replacing weed with tobacco

I recently posted on r/leaves about quitting weed and alcohol and tobacco and so far haven't had any weed. But I have had beers and some whiskey and cigars. I'm sure I'd have weed if I got the opportunity. I've had a cigar every night for the past three nights. 

Any advice on how to not fall into a nicotine addiction on top of it all?

My second day, could use a pep-talk

I'm 21yo female and have been smoking since I was maybe 13/14. tonight at around 2:30am will be my first 48 hours cigarette-free in at least 3 years. 

Pretty crazy to think about...

my first 24hrs wasn't so bad, but today I feel manic and I'm really craving a cig.

I've read Allen Carr's book and I have it at home, but I'm too afraid to even read about quitting smoking without getting the urge to buy a pack. 

I feel majorly unproductive without smoking. I feel like I don't wish to accomplish anything if I'm not smoking before/after doing it. I know it's a trap and I know smoking doesn't make any task easier/less stressful. I know that. I just want to hear that I'm doing well and that it will get easier. I am stuffing myself with David's sunflower seeds every other few minutes. I have a headache and I'm drinking water. 

I'm scared. I'm scared of a life without smoking. I'm scared of being bored or getting fat. I'm even scared of living a long time. I'm scared of telling anyone I've decided to quit. I don't want to give up my quit now because it's supposed to be my NY resolution and I don't want to give up like I did last NYE.... 

someone plz pep-talk me into believing I've made the right choice

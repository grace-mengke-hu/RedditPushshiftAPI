i thought i had it

24 days in and I smoked. I drank and I smoked at least 7 or 8 smokes.
I honestly thought I had it. I had read about others smoking at around the same 3 week mark and I thought I was past it. I had a few drinks which I shouldn't have since I am trying to quit drinking too. 


So disappointed in myself but I know I can do it. No more drinking!! No more smoking!!

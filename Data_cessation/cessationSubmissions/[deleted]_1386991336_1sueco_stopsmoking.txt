I feel like a B**** for how I'm going to quit.

So, about 6 months ago I stopped smoking for a month and a week. 
I felt great. 
And then, I caved. I'm not even sure why. I didn't have a craving. I was just sitting on the porch, talking to my mom (A smoker) and I was like... "Let me get a drag off that?" And she let me. 
3 hours later, I went to the gas station and bought a pack. This was literally my logic... "I quit so easily, I can enjoy a pack and be done." 

Well, obviously that back-fired, and in my ignorance. 

I've gone on and off. A week here, a few days there. And I'm just weak. I can't do it for whatever reason. 
I talked to my doctor today and she recomended Chantix. So I'm waiting for insurance to approve, and I'll be getting my script probably monday, and giving it a shot. 

I really do want to quit. But GD. 

I feel like such a bitch for quitting by using a method other than cold turkey. Especially a pill. 

(I tried the E-cigs before, and it only made me want cigs more.)

Tl;DR: It's not really worth the read honestly if that was too long. It's just me self loathing.

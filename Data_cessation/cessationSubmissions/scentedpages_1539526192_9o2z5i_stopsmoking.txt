Over a month and a half and could use some encouragement.

Hi everyone. Just looking for a little encouragement. I quit 48 days ago with the help of the patch and lozenges. The first week or two was pretty hard, but I was motivated. Now, that sense of motivation is gone. Every single day has been a contest, and now I'm just feeling tired. I'm tired of wanting a cigarette, if that makes sense. Every day for the past week, I've seriously considered saying "fuck it" and picking up a pack. I catch my tricky addict brain trying to justify letting myself just have one or two. And I've noticed that I have this dangerous attitude of "it's not a matter of if but when I'm going to slip." So right now I'm throwing this out there instead of running to the gas station and hoping getting this off my chest will make me feel a little better. 

Thanks for listening!

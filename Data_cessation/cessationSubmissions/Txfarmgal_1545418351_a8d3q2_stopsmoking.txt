8-months of failure. First hour of freedom.

I started quitting in April. 
Insert expletives here. 

I almost gave up on quitting because I became tired of the constant failure.

But, why not just succeed instead?

Today, at 12:21 was my FINAL smoke. I _know_ I am giving up nothing and gaining health, wealth, confidence, peace, clean teeth, etc.

8 bleeping months later, I am finally free.

All help to keep me here is sincerely appreciated.

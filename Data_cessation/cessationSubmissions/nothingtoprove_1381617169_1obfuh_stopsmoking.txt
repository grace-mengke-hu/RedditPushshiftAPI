Big test and victory today

I know this probably is going to sound crazy, but I sort of feel silly posting in here because I am so thoroughly over smoking.  That being said, I wanted to share what I would consider a victory that I had today.

My wife and I took our kids to the local renaissance festival today, which was a lot of fun by the way, and I walked past *so many* smokers!  It was amazing to me how many there were (or at least how easily I noticed them) and I got a real sense of how my wife has felt for years being around me.  It just *stank* whenever I walked by someone!

Far from being tempted, today was a solid reminder and reaffirmation for me.  To all of you quitters out there, keep strong!  Life is so much better without that monkey on your back!

Day Three...

I wrote this in a text to my brother while distracting myself from what for 20 years has been the time for my morning smoke.


Day three: a demon hovers over my shoulder: I had forgotten his presence entirely. Since he introduced himself almost twenty years ago, he's been a constant companion, but now, as I seek to send him away, he again makes himself known. He whispers in my ear falsities of pleasure and relaxation: of relief. His breath stinks of the burning and putrid land from which he comes, and I begin to smell it on all that I own. Somehow I never noticed. I can hear now the beginnings of desperation in his voice. He knows I'm ignoring him, and rustles his leathery wings in agitation. All these years I've been afraid to look him in the eyes, afraid of the immense power he wields. Now I look, and he drops his glare in shame or submission. Without my approval, he is nothing: a mere reflection of a shadow of the lie of the power I had given him. Soon he'll be naught but a heap of ashes, to be blown away with the first gust of wind.

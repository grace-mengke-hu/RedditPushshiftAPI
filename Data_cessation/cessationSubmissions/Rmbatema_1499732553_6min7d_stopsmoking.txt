4 days 12 Hours

Hi all. I have been smoke free (cold turkey) for almost 5 days now. I was a pack a day smoker for 13 years. I have never made it this far before. I vaped for a while last year trying to quit, but found myself just as dependent on the vape pen, and when it broke or died, I immediately would buy a pack. 

So here I am. I find myself close to tears a lot, Im crying now. I can't focus at work. I have a very short fuse. I find myself annoyed with my friends. I really want this to stick, I know I can make it stick. But the emotional pain is not something I was expecting.

Everytime I relapse, it's like I forget why and how bad I want to quit

I'm at that stage where the cravings are strongest in the first hours after a quit. For me at least if I manage to stay 2 days without smoking I dont get cravings anymore. I just have to endure two or three two-hours long cravings then I'm free. But in those two hours my hindbrain tries everything to convince me that I should smoke. Then I get one or two random melancholic episodes after one week and one month where I just need to get a rest otherwise I start wanting a cigarette. I have to learn to recognize and remember in those moments why I'm doing it. Just wanted to write this down to help myself

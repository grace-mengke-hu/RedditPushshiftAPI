1 week free!

I know it's not a huge amount of time, but I am proud to have made it this far.

I've smoked for about 16 years. I have tried to quit before, but always for other people. "You smell", "It's too expensive", "I worry about your health" and it's nice they care or want me to stop but this time I'm quitting for me.

I do crave them still, and it's hard to fight. I've been taking my dog for quick walks whenever the urge is very strong, which he seems to like, and it's nice to be able to actually smell the outside world for once.

I've always been able to run fine but I tried going for a jog yesterday for the first time since quitting and oh crap, did my lungs hurt! Lots of coughing up gooey stuff too. yum yum :/
I've noticed I'm getting a lot of aches and pains around my upper back and arms, which I guess is my body getting rid of the old toxins. It's annoying but I have to push through! It's not the worst addiction I've kicked or the worst pain I've felt.

Sorry for the rambling, but I felt good about myself for getting this far and wanted to share.

To everyone else just starting to quit, I don't have much experience, but just get past those first few days and it becomes a little easier. You can do it!

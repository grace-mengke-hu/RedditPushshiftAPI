Do I have the smokers flu or a regular flu?

Day 80 for me today but never had too much coughing or mucus coming up until yesterday. I'm hoping it is just the smoker's flu and my lungs are doing their part in getting rid of all the gunk ive smoked in it till now. Has anyone had a smoker's flu this late in their quit?

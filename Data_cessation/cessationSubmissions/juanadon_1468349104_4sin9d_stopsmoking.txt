Approaching quit date! Some tips to prepare?

Hi /r/stopsmoking!

A couple of months ago, my SO [28M] and I[28F] decided that we've had enough of smoking, and that we'd both like to quit. We're both health conscious in many ways, and it just doesn't align with our life goals anymore!

I'm currently working full time while in grad school, and he just finished his PhD and is working a contract while job hunting. In other words, we're both a bit stressed... so we decided to set our quit date for August 1st in order to give ourselves time to smoke without shame and process what we're about to do.

Since then, we've had a lot of long discussions about why we want to quit and feel great about the decision -- however, August 1st is approaching, and I was wondering if any of you could suggest some strategies for the next few weeks as well as the beginning stages of quitting!

He's been a regular smoker for longer than I have, but quit for about a year in between. I was always a social smoker, and have been smoking up to 5-6 a day for about a year now. 

Thanks a lot.

12 hour head start, but apprehensive about committing. Was there anything enjoyable about your first few days?

I smoked my last cigarette about an hour before bed last night and had to work early this morning. When I'm out of work I'll have about 18 hours. I'm afraid that once I leave work I'll cave and buy another pack. 

I'm also nervous because tomorrow is my birthday and I'm planning on drinking with friends tonight. 

What are some things that you noticed during your first few days without cigarettes? I just read Alan Carr's book, but I haven't made it more than a day yet.

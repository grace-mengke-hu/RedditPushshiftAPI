So close to 60 days but struggling so much...

So I've only slipped once in the 58 days I've been quit when we had an accident at home... But today seems to have been a really bad day.

I bought a pack of cigarettes this morning. I haven't smoked one, but I'm having a tough time not smoking one. Just looking for some support or someone else having issues at this point in time.

I know there's probably a thousand posts about this, but I just read Alan Carr's Easyway (illustrated version) in one sitting.

Holy shit.  I knew everything this book had to say, but seeing it all lined up and laid out.  Mentally, I feel like it's impossible to smoke now.  How could I possibly smoke after reading this?  What an amazingly good book.  I highly recommend it.

I think I've done it. Thank you guys =)

Yesterday i hit 1 week of not smoking so i decided to challenge myself.

I took 1 cigarette and a lighter, put em in a pocket and went to classes.
I had a few breaks where i wanted to light it but i resisted.
I went to sit down with a friend of mine to a park which was close by and i took the cigarette and took the lighter. Then i thought to myself why the fuck am I ruinning my streak for a few smokes. Being on a bigger streak (yeah, im on my record of 8 now) is a way way better feeling than having a smoke. 

Think this was the last urge to light up i've ever had. Wouldn't be able to do it without you guys, i've read this sub every morning for a week now and its actualy working =).Thanks ALOT!

Congratulations to my husband who quit 3 years ago today! You can do it too, keep trying!

My husband broke his hip. Smoked his last cigarette right before the ambulance arrived. He was warned smoking would seriously affect his recovery, so he quit after more than 30 years of smoking. He inspired me to quit also. Quitting is not easy but keep trying. You'll beat this, wait and see!

Decided yesterday to try to quit smoking. I need some help.

I decided yesterday to quit smoking. I finished a pack and I thought, no. Stop. No more. I've 'quit' before, but I really want to try again this time. 
It's going to be hard. I'm a student, I live in a share house where everyone smokes (not inside). If not all my friends, most smoke. At all the events that I go to, everyone smokes. Alcohol and cigarettes are like a combo-deal to me, and so is my morning coffee. 

So, please. I need some help. Not only is the impact on my bank balance a motivator, but I've been hitting the gym pretty hard recently and the contradiction between smoking and gyming has hit me hard in the face. 

Any thoughts/tips/motivators would be greatly appreciated.

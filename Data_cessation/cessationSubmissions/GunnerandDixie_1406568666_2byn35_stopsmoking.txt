I made it through my biggest challenge yet.

I met my girlfriends abusive father for the first time, and from the beginning I wanted to hit him so badly. The whole time he was acting nice but would grab her in weird ways, and a couple of times I was shaking from holding my desire to punish him back. After an entire day of holding that sort of rage back, my girlfriend got really mad at me once we got home (3 hours in horrible traffic while she slept) over nothing because she was having a PTSD episode from seeing him. I went to work which is next to a gas station and genuinely thought about buying a pack and sitting in the sun. I'm not sure why I didn't still to be honest, but I'm glad that whatever inner strength kept me clean did.

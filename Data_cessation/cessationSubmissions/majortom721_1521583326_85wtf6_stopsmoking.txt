Quitting and vaping

Doc gave me chantix and a light antidepressant. Switched to vaping for a week straight, which I've always hated but suddenly it was completely doable. Works like a miracle. 

But then I realized, why am i wasting the chantix and not beating my addiction to nicoteen? My goal isn't to be an all day vaper. So I went back to smoking cigs for a few days, excited about my new plan: using 0 nicoteen juice in my vapes with the chantix, and only using nicoteen juice for serious cravings. (I have like 4 e cigs I like). Going to try to start in a few days.

Man does the chantix work, I can't even maintain my alcoholism on it, since the lake of heat with the vapes means I can't drink nearly as quickly. 

Any opinions? Pros? Cons? Past experiences?

Thanks!

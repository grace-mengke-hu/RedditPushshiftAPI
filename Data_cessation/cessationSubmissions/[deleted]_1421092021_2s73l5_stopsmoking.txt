So it begins. Stopping today.

From about age 18 to 25 I smoked quite regularly, maybe a pack every day or two. From age 25-35 I smoked maybe 1-5 cigarettes per day, sometimes I would go days without smoking. I'm really kicking myself because from age 25-35 I was super active, worked out a lot etc. I'm in shape but just couldn't resist that smoke every now and again.


Today, at age 35, I'm done. 100% done. Zero cigarettes per day. My wife is pregnant with our first child and I want to be around for a good long time.


Does anyone know of a resource that can show me what what my risks are having had a habit as I've had?

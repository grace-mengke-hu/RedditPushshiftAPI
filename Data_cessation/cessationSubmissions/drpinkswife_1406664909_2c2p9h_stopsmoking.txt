What a Day!

I don't think I've had a solid 8 hours sleep since Saturday night. But I can sleep in tomorrow, so, yay me.

Even so, I've put in motion more changes! 

I've downloaded the C25K app. I did this because my mother insinuated on FB that I couldn't do it. Don't tell me I can't do something.

I'm going to check out a women's gym on Thursday and I hate gyms! ELI - P.S. This is completely your fault! I just don't want to waste all this extra energy and lung capacity. I want to see what I can do.

I was exhausted today, but I had a driving lesson after work and I nailed every manoeuvre. I'm ready.

* Quit Smoking
* Get foreign driver's license
* Buy 'new to me' car - something to fit my personality
* Get out of job I hate for job worthy of me
* Get fitter
* Run 5km
 
And I have the confidence I can do this because I did the first thing on the list. Plain and simple. 

Bit of a repeater this, but I'm cream crackered. 

P.S. Waiting for the jokes on what kind of car I will get. :)

I've decided to quit smoking [update 2]

Update from [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6pvf1v/ive_decided_to_stop_smoking_update/)

This was my plan to stop smoking:

Days 1-4: 10 100s
Days 5-8: 10 shorts
Days 9-12: 5 100s
Days 13-16: 5 shorts
Days 17-20: 3 shorts
Days 21-24: 2 shorts
Day 25: smoke free

Today is day 25, but I messed up my math somewhere and ran out of cigarettes two days ago (day 23) instead of yesterday (day 24). I decided just to quit a day early instead of buying another pack, so as of right now I've been smoke free for 1d 14h. 

Yesterday was a rough day for me. I about broke down a couple times, but in the end I managed to make it through the first day smoke free. I'm was hoping it would get easier today but I've already got a pretty bad headache this morning so I'm digging in for another hard day. 

Any tips, tricks, or testimonies are always welcome. I'm planning on setting up the flair badge thing later on when I can get to a computer. Other than that, thanks for listening and have a good day!

Came home to visit my family who smokes after not smoking for seven months.

I was a smoker for almost 15 years. It’s tough, but honestly it isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Since I quit, the smell of smoke makes me sick and I can’t stand to be around other people who smoke. I thought coming home would make me relapse and start smoking again because almost everyone in my family smokes, but I’m so happy to be able to sit in a car/be around them while their all smoking and not have one myself. I’m so proud of myself and I’m proud of all of you! We got this!!

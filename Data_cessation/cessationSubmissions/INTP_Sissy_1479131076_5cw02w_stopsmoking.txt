Hi! I need some advice on social smoking

Thank you in advance for the work you are doing here.

I don't speak very good english.

My problem is the following: four days ago I replaced cigarrettes by tiny cigars. I know they are worst for my health but I barely have smoked ten in those four days. Yesterday I actually achieved 24 hours smoke free. It was really hard. 

But today at college I started smoking again. I have an irritability/anger/impatiens issue, and I feel strong cravings during classes breaks because they are long and I have nothing to do to kill time. In addition to this, during breaks all my friends smoke.

Still I want to quit, I have not lost hope.

I would like some insight in dealing with those social situations and also dealing with impatiens cravings.

thank you!

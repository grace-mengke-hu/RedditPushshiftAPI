Having trouble getting started

How did you guys finish after your last cigarette? I can't seem to have that 'last' smoke without it becoming all I think about the next morning, when I usually have a cigarette first thing. It's just a hard habit to break, even when I don't consider the nicotine factor. It doesn't help that it is literally impossible for me to stay away from people who smoke, because so many people I work with smoke. Any tips?

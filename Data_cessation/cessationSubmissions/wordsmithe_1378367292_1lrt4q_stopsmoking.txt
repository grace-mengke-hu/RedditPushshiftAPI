My Second Time Quitting

Last year I gave myself an amazing birthday present. I quit smoking.  I went strong for 9 months, but I ended up picking up the habit because of a nasty break up.  (I was being a big ol' baby).

Now I'm starting again, and just wanted some feedback on ways to REALLY want to quit.  I have a lot of those "I don't give a fuck" moments and I'm trying to really keep on track.

What are some tips for a person on their second go around?

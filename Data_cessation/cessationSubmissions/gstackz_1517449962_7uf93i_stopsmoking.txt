Some advice

Been smoking for 3 years  between half pack and full depends my situation that day . But listen guy . The advice I will share with you will greatly help you in stop smoking..

You need to have it in your mind that you need to or want to quit - if you dont they really isn’t a point.  Think of how it’s going to effect you in the future . 

Then FOR ME I had to distance my self from smoke and took a break from my friends that heavily smoke . Not complete but would minimize my time with them 

Then GET BUSY 
Work 
Gym 
Anything 

That’s how I am 4 months and continues smoke free

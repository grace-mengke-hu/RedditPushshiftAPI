Trying gum, any thing I should know?

I decided that I didn't want to resort to taking anti-depressants, and the patches always peeled off at work, even when duct taped on. So I'm trying the gum now, and it seems to be working really well so far, haven't had a cigarette since Thursday! I still get minor cravings when I see someone smoking, but it seems to be quite manageable. 

Has anyone here managed to quit using just the gum? Or is it best used with other nicotine supplements in the long term? Anything I should know or be expecting about the gum that perhaps wasn't in the booklet?

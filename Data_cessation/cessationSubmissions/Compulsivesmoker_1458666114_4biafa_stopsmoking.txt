Lasted 14hours before relapse. Feeling ashamed and kinda proud.

Hi reddit. It me again. I stopped smoking yesterday at 6pm ish and relapsed today at 9am. After that i smoked pack in 4hours. But im trying to quit again. I reseted my badge and i wont request it before im able to go day without smoking.
But anyway id like to ask how do you guys resist the urge of the first smoke in morning?

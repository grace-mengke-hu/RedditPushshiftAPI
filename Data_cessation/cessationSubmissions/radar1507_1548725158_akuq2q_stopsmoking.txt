Cold Turkey. Close to finishing my 3rd day of being smoke-free. Its been 17 years of smoking a pack a day.

Its been a long time coming, but I finally "wanted" to quit, rather than needing to quit. I tried going cold turkey 12 years ago, but only lasted a week.

I was on the patch for two weeks during the summer of 2009, and went right back to smoking.

One thing that has helped me significantly is that I haven't had a drink in 4 months. I've had one drink in the past 7 months. I was diagnosed with a hyper-active thyroid, and the medication makes life incompatible with alcohol.

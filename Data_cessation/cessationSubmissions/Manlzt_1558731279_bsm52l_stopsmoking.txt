2 days until my NEW deadline need support..

Hello guys,

I've been trying to quit since 1y (yeah it means 5 reals attemtps..) my last try was next week and the problem is I've never passed the 24h limit.

Yeah, I've been Smoking for 10y and since then I never had a day without a cigaret, even sick, even with family I've Always found a way to smoke at least one cigaret. 

So last Saturday was my deadline to quit, I've prepared this day from month, affirmation, visualisation, to do list, objectives ... And the D day I gave up in the Afternoon, ending up crying while asking myself how can I be so weak ...

Don't know how to manage with this voice on my head going from "this discusting things isn't helping you in anyway and you know it!" To "just one, you need it, it cannot be so bad, you will never really suit smoking anyway!"

So this week I continue challeging myself between fighting the craving and smoking anyway .. I've smoke 9 cigaret a day maximum (instead of 20) so not that Bad but I don't want and can't be a "small smoker" I WANT TO QUIT , I need this success in my life.

So I've d√©cided to try again this Sunday and will love to see your advice if your recognize yourself on my situation ! 

Hope I won't seem too weak for this Reddit because since I discover this conversation I feel so much good energy here, Hope I won't ruin it ! 

Thanks if you took the time to read me, sorry for the autocorrection from the French keyboard and hope everyone here will success in quitting this shit !

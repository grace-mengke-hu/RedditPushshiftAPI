10 Days! Yay! ... Are these normal side effects?

Hi all! I'm ten days free after a being a weird smoker (smoked during the week, but not on weekends. One pack last the week.)

Today I started feeling like I've got a bit of a sore throat, kind of like what I felt around day 3, and it's kind of "hot", like you'd feel after a night of hinge drinking and smoking. 

I'm thinking it's related to the quitting, but maybe not?

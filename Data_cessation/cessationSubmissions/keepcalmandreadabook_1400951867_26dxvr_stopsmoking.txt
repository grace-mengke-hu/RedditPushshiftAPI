I want to smoke SO FUCKING BAD.

I know I know I know smoking is bad for you and gross and makes your teeth yellow but dear god I was this close 20 minutes ago driving to my new home (I just moved states) to smoking, I even pulled into a gas station and debated with myself before I left. Maybe it's because of my new move and new job and new apartment I'm trying to get, I also just graduated and haven't had a break in a few months, so I feel like I'm going crazy, and also I am in a brand new town.

I also keep thinking about how now that I'm out on my own and I'm a writer I should smoke cigarettes because writers do that, as lame as that sounds. I saw a picture of Ayn Rand smoking and thought oh GOD I WANT A PACK. Now that I can spend my days writing all day I picture myself taking smoke breaks (which I used to do when I wrote all day). I'm at 82 days, help guys!

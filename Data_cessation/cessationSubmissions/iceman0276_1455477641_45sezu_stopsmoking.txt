Started smoking again...

I didn't come here for sympathy so much as to just be accountable. I had quit for about 25 days, but slipped back into it because my ex and I are going through things again. Love sucks. I'm going on a vacation to Kauai this Thursday. Is a vacation a good time to stop smoking? Is there too much stress involved?

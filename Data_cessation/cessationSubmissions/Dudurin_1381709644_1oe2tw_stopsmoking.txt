A motivation tool

Hey people of reddit! First thread here!

Basically I quit smoking just over 2 months ago, cold turkey all the way! Now, I'm one of those people that quit several times in the past, but never made it past the 10 day mark. This time, however, I made myself a new motivator. I started a daily transfer on my netbank (not sure what you call those in english), where I transfer the cost of 1 pack of cigarettes from my main account, to another account I had lying around. If I ever really start craving, I jump on my computer and check the balance. Instant motivation! It'll start out slow, but trust me, it adds up!

Don't know if it's the idea of the century, but if I can help just 1 smoker become an ex smoker, I'll be happy!

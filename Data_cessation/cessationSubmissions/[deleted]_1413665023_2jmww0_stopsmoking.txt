Playing with fire...

So a couple of days ago I had a big argument with my boyfriend - a true make it or break it kind of thing. It led to a very cathartic six-hour long talk over wine, and my boyfriend was chain smoking all the while. Although I no longer feel I miss it, and I certainly don't envy him at all any more for smoking, I took a cigarette from him and held it between my fingers. I never even thought about lighting it, but I held it and I fidgeted with it and I found great comfort in doing so...

What makes it even worse is that the following night, when out with some friends, I also took a cigarette from the table and toyed with it for a while - never actually considering lighting it, just enjoying having it in my hand.

The whole thing screams slippery slope, but to some extent I feel like this is something I can 'get away with' even though I know it's a bad idea.

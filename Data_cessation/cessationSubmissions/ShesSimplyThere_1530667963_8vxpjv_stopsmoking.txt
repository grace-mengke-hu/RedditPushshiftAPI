Resetting my badge.

I've been hiding from you guys (and from myself, most importantly). I have failed. I fell off the wagon a few weeks ago. I reset my stop smoking app after the first few cigarettes, then ignored it, and haven't stopped smoking since. 

I need to write this. I need to take ownership of what's happened. Feeling shitty and hard of breathing seems to not work as wake up calls, and only made me wallow in further self pity for failing. 

Today, I woke up not feeling sad. I woke up feeling optimistic. I have already gone through 2018 with the most days not smoked since my last attempt 6 years ago. It's time to cut this 20 year habit once and for all. 

My birthday is coming up soon.. and I look forward to celebrating as a non-smoker.

Thanks for all your continued support, r/stopsmoking.

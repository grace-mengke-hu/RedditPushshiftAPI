First full day without training wheels

I quit tobacco cigarettes over two weeks ago, but today is the first day I've gone without nicorette gum or an e-cig.  I don't hate the world and I don't feel like smoking.  Keep moving forward, guys, you can do it and it's extremely satisfying to not have the need.

I know I'm not done, but it's a damn good place to start.

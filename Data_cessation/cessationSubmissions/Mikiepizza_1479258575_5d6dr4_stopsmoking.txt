For the love of christsickles please read this book: Allan Carr's easyway to quit smoking.

You're probably thinking to yourself, Shark this guy (this is a particularly offensive expletive where I am from) , there's no way reading a book will help me quit smoking. And like myself, and all those who come before me, you are dead wrong. You dumby. You dumb dumby. 

Four years ago a friend of my sister told me about a book titled: Alan Carr's easyway to quit smoking. This was during a party at my sister's house, and I just so happened to be smoking during this conversation. I told him I'd check it out, but inside I knew how ridiculous this was. How could a book possibly allow me to quit smoking? My sister's friend apparently knew what I was thinking though and told me he had thought the same thing. So I read the book, which interestingly encourages you to continue smoking while you read it. I tore my pack of cigarettes in half the day I finished reading. I have never looked back. 

Every person I have recommended this book to since has quit smoking, even people who have smoked for 40-50 years and have tried dozens of times to quit. Just read it. It's short. Do it. Seriously, Do it. 

Love,

P.S. 
Here's the link. buy it. I'll find you if you don't and read it to you at night like a lullaby. I'm so broke I have eaten beans for dinner the last ten nights but I will still buy this for you if you request it. You deserve it.

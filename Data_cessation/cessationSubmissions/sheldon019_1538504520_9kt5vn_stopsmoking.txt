My quitting experience

I started smoking at 14, I am turning 20 in a month. I quit on new years. 

Relapsed in June for almost 2 months and now have been quit again since the end of July. I originally started going to the gym jan-june and gained 20 pounds, unfortunatly had to stop due to an injury(my reason for relapse). 

During my time smoking for 2 months my injury healed so I proceeded to go to the gym again and wow did i feel like ASS. The feeling of my body not performing at peak potential due to my poor decisions infuriated me. It was the first time I really felt a direct consequence from the habit. This ultimately motivated me to quit immediately and for good this time(I really think so). I suffered through the nasty withdrawals and long energetic-less days for a 2nd time this year with nothing but my new found passion for health and longevity keeping me motivated. 

The reason I wanted to share this was because prior to this year I personally thought quitting would be impossible. I was so wrong. You need to  replace your dopamine vacuum from quitting with something you are passionate about. From my experience I found something I was passionate about and that was taking care of my body. 

I hope someone reads this and it maybe helps turn a new leaf. Cheers.

The time is now.

23-JAN-13.

That is my quit date, why is it that? Well, simply because it is my first day back to work, and the start of my 6 day work week. I believe that will be enough distraction to get over the physical needs of nicotine and then it is just a mental battle.

I'm doing this, because it is a new job, I've just moved in with my girlfriend, just got a new puppy, and just started to work out again, why not add another life altering decision/task to the list of good fortunes.

To everyone who has quit, I commend you on your fortitude and resolve. 

tldr;

I'm quitting and it's -30 out right meow (Damn, Canada)

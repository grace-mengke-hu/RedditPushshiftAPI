around a year and a half and yet...

i havent had a cigarette in at least a year and a half. not even drag. but i still think about then often and get cravings sometimes. doesnt matter though. im not going to have one. fuck dat shit. the best way to quit smoking is to stop buying packs. just dont! find something else to spend $10 a day on. and if you cant find anything then put those $10 in a jar everyday and watch it grow. i believe every single one of you can kick the butt!

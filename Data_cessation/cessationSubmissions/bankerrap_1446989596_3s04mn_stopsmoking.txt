Celebrated one month with 5 miles run

I used to run as a smoker, but due to an injury and I took a lot of time off. Then just got lazy and unfit due to (you guessed it) smoking a lot. 

Today I marked one month free, with a 5.5 mile race around a city. 

Here's to not smoking. 

Happy to offer tips on running for those trying to get into it. It's honestly great fun!

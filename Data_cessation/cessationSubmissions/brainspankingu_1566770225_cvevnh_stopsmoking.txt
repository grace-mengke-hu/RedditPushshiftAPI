How to Quit Once and For All

A few years ago, I had heart issues and could barely get up a single flight of stairs. 

Like so many of you, I had TRIED to stop smoking dozens of times and had been a pack-and-a-half smoker for over 25 years, starting as a young teenage kid. 

So, one day, I heard Tony Robbins talking about why TRYING to change something presupposes failure. He said creating any big change in your life requires you to FULLY COMMIT yourself mentally, then taking massive action immediately afterward. 

I wasn't even thinking about quitting at the time, but I wanted to test his statement. I decided then and there to be a non-smoker, and IMMEDIATELY jumped online and found a free hypnosis recording for quitting smoking. It worked so well, I never even had any withdrawal symptoms and I was completely free after all those years! 

I was so impressed, I started learning all I could about mental reprogramming and became a hypnotist myself.  I've since even used it to stop a lifelong habit of nail-biting... Heck, I can't even remember a time I didn't bite my nails. But not anymore. 

That said, I wanted to create even better free hypnosis sessions than what I used to quit, so I created my own. I'm hoping this helps you too. 

Here it is. I'm not asking for anything, btw...

Idea for a sticky thread

Hey all, I just posted this in another thread and wondering what you all think-

I just had an idea that would be less work for the mods but I think would be helpful. What if we just opened up a sticky thread and asked all users to post what the best advice they've gotten from this sub, or elsewhere, and let the upvote system sort out the rest. I think there would be a benefit to having everything in one place for new visitors.

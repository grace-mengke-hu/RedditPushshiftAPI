Day 2 today and this time, I actually feel like I can do it.

Been smoking for a decade and I've finally had enough of not having enough energy to get through the day and being winded when doing physical activity. I've tried quitting before but failed. But this time around, I actually feel like I can do it! A few days before I quit I was scrolling through this sub and somehow accidentally subscribed so for a few days I was confused as to why posts from this sub were popping up. But I'm glad that happened because reading what people are saying has encouraged me that I actually can quit and smoking really isn't worth it. EVER. I'm looking forward to a healthy lifestyle.

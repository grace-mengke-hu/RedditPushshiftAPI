Backward react instead of drowning more

3 weeks smoke free. I was heavy smoker. I smoked 2 packet of strong cigarettes a day for 3 years. My cousin cheat us on our factory and stole our money in 4 years. Irans law court is shit. 
Also i had drinking habits. 5 month ago i start traveling to 3 country. Nepal,dubai and georgia. In last day my girlfriend just said to me that she meets someone. I didn't say anything to her. It happened after 5 years. So normally I could smoker more and been drunk every night or any bad habits could came up. 
But i did something different. I don't know. Maybe i use my logic. I quit smoking. It was like i said to my bad habits: you are exactly the same shit as my cousin and girlfriend or etc. 
i call it backward react

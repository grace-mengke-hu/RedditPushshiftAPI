32 Hours since my last cigarette... today was rough...

It's been 32 hours and 18 minutes since my last cigarette... working in a tattoo shop where most of my other co-workers smoke has been rough... chewed a helluva lot of gum today... drank a lot of ice cold water... Felt like I had ADHD because I was crazy energetic and my mind was all over the place... something like "Paperwork... piercing... cigarette?... NO can't have that... shiny shit... sharp shit... aftercare... cigarette?... NO WON'T DO THAT... design lettering... Cigarette?... Nope... scrub tubes... cigarette?... NOPE... answer the phone... cigarette?... no way..." 

Hopefully tomorrow will be a little easier...

5 minutes in, 15 years of smoking a pack a day. GOING COLD TURKEY!

I'm so gawdamn sick of smoking. I am sick of planning out quitting and failing. I am sick of my wife rolling her eyes every time I tell her I want to quit. I'm sick of worrying at night that I'm developing smoking related heart disease and am going to have a stroke in my sleep and never see my cat again. I'm sick of paying 8 dollars a day every day for something that is killing me. I'm sick of lying to my father who knows I smoke but pretends that I am only an occasional smoker. I'm sick of knowing that whenever my niece and nephew see me smoking that I am only increasing the likelihood of them smoking in the future. I could go on... 

I might update later if I make it through the evening. I have 2 cigarettes left in my pack and I have to leave them because if I smoke them I will have to buy a pack for some "emergency" smokes. Or not. Jesus, I forgot to mention that I hate the way I can rationalize away all my will power and self respect for one 'last' cigarette.

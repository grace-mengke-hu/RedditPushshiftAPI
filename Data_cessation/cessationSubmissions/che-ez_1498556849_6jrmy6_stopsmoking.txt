I stopped for three months after reading Allen Carr's book. I am now back on a pack a day. I am terrified and I need help.

I have re-read the book and it doesn't seem to help anymore. I am scared of having to go the rest of my life torturing myself. I feel like Allen Carr offered me an easy way out and I blew it like I always do. Every time I begin an attempt now, I fail within a week. The cravings for nicotine seem to gestate as "this attempt was doomed anyway," "I wasn't ready to quit this time," or something to that affect. 

Please give me some advice to kick this habit again, or to make Allen Carr's book work like magic for a second time.

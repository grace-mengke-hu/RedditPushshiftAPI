What is the best way to support someone quitting smoking?

Hello! I'm new here. My mom has smoked for 30 years and is being hospitalized more and more frequently bc she also has severe asthma and copd. She just got out of the hospital a few days ago, and has to be on an oxygen tank. 

I think being on an oxygen tank is what made her realize she can't continue as she has been. I know she's upset she has to have one (it hopefully is only a temporary thing) but I'm hoping it'll make her realize how much she needs to quit smoking.

Right before she came home, I moved all of her cigarettes. Now she constantly asks me to have one a day, and I'm not sure what the move should be. The rest of our family would be mad to find out she smoked, and ultimately I would be blamed for it.

I'm not sure if I should let her or if I should make her quit cold turkey. She works from home and tells me she needs one to concentrate, which I understand, but I don't know what to do here.

What should I do? Also, what is the best way to support her? I do a lot for her and around the house bc I don't have a job. 

Any advice you have is deeply appreciated! Thank you!!

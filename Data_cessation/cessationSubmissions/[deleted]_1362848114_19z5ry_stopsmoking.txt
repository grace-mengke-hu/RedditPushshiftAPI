Haven't had one since last night

I decided to just not buy another pack.  One of my sisters had a heart attack yesterday and is in the hospital, and she's a smoker, so it sort of pushed me to decide to quit smoking so I don't end up having one myself.  Weird how a really stressful situation would cause me to decide to quit.  I'm also going to read that one book all of you keep referring people to read.

The cravings are incredibly intense this morning.  I usually have one with my coffee, but now it's just me and my coffee (insert meme -- "there's so much room for activities!"), but right now I'm not even sure what to do with myself.  Brain keeps saying, "You miss it!  Remember the taste?  Mmm, tasty smokey treats."  My brain is weird, so I'm just going to ignore it.

Right now, in this moment, I am a non-smoker, and I will continue to be.

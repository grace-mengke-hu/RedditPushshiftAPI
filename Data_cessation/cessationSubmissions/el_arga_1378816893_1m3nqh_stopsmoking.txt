I need to stop (fairly long)

Cigarettes are starting to take a toll on my health, and I need to stop. I've been smoke free for two days now, but it's getting really hard. I have no physical withdrawal symptoms, but the cravings and constant need for one is driving me insane. I can't stop thinking about them. I keep reaching for my back pocket where I would keep them, and they aren't there I free out and have a minipanic attack that I can't find them. 

And I know is long or maybe not. I don't know this subs formatting. I'm m sorry. Coupled with my waking up and  having a emotional breakdown is making today especially hard. 

I've been smoking since I was 14 (currently 19) and I was up to two and a half packs a day. I keep smelling smelling the burnt smoke, and I don't know what to do. 

I just really need to talk to someone or hear helpful things or something.

Off cigarettes for one week now

I quit cold turkey two weeks ago but caved in to cravings last weekend. I've been really ashamed of myself since then.

After some research, I decided I need some sort of nicotine replacement therapy, and I picked up a cheap e-cig and some "juice" with the lowest nicotine content I could get. I'm not proud of using the e-cig and I don't *like* using it.

However, it has kept me off cigarettes for 7 days now, so I'm posting this as a small victory.

My next goal is to set a date to cut to zero nicotine. Then I'll be one step away from my ultimate goal of quitting smoking/"vaping" entirely.

Day 2, Iâ€™m very depressed and anxious

First of all, this sub is a huge help, thank you guys so much. 

Yesterday was just great, I even felt happier than before. But today I woke up with a very depressed and paranoid mind. I already caused a fight with my boyfriend because I thought he was cheating on me without any reason. 

I have no desire to smoke, what else can I do to feel better and not ruin all of my relationships?

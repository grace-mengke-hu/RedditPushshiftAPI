Fallout 4 has been good

Ive been struggling with quitting smoking for years now. However I've found something that has kept me from smoking for almost a week now... Fallout. I shit you not, Fallout 4 has allowed me to be a week free of nicotine. This has never happened. At least not for a year. Thanks Bethesda!.....?

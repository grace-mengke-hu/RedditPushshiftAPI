24 hours and my focus is out the windarrrageface! I know it gets easier but I'm glad I can vent.

Focused on a project instead-- and I was doing great! ...until I messed up some code and now I'm drinking hot yerba mate with cayenne pepper. It helps. As does this sub. I like reading others' struggles. It helps. Keep going.

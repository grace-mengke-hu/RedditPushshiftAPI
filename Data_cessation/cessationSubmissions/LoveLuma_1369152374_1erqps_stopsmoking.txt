Almost caved...need to cave.

I was going completly kill 6 weeks! My stress or insanity got the better of me and I guess I convinced a coworker to get me a cigarette the other day. I smelled it, it smells amazing. I wanted to smoke it but it was my 6 weeks cigarette free day so I couldn't. I didn't get rid of it but I did not smoke it. I want to though. I refuse to get rid of it but im scared that means I will cave even though I haven't yet. My thoughts are far from rational right now. I really wonder if just one cigarette is bad or not. Could I space that cigarette out forever? I bet it would taste yummy..just one puff. This  f###ing sucks. I went so long and now I feel like it was a waste of time. I want this cigarette.*edit* I am good. Didn't smoke the cigarette. Poor little guy broke anyway so it is gone. ^_^ Gum is good. Way better than cigarettes. Thank you everyone for being the most awesome support group ever!

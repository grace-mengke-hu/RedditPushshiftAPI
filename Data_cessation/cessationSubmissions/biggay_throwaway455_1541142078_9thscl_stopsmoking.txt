Trying to prevent a habit

I'm 19 and relatively new to smoking, but I know I'm genetically predisposed to addiction, and I want to stop. I've gone through about four cycles of throwing out half-used packs I bought in moments of stress. Last one was like an hour ago. 

Also, I'm asthmatic and I think this whole thing is just a way for me to punish myself. When it comes to reasons for smoking, is that common? I'm hoping some of you folks who have been smoking / trying to stop for longer can scare me out of it or just offer some advice. Thank you.

Quit date set...

Quit date is set for the first of July. I'm a little more than halfway through Allen Carr's book and I'm fuckin ready to do this thing. Fuck being a prisoner to the tobacco corporation and a slave to these fucking cancer sticks. 
I need to pick up a hobby.. what will I do with all my extra time?? I can tell you my house is about to be real clean.. 

Wish me luck! This time it's the real deal... fingers crossed.

2nd Month cigarette free!

So after N tries to quit, i finally made it! 2 months smoke free. At times, cravings get too intense. All I can do is either, drink coffee or eat. Any suggestions you do when cravings get too intense? I would like to refrain from coffee as I'm having troubles sleeping. Also need to refrain from eating (I already gained 5kg).

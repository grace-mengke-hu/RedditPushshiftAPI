Almost two months

Been almost two months and I still want to smoke at least 2-3 times an hour. I miss it. I miss the smell ,miss the taste. 

I miss sitting on my deck having a smoke as I listen to the world around me. 

My heart and lungs are doing much better, but were they really that bad to begin with?

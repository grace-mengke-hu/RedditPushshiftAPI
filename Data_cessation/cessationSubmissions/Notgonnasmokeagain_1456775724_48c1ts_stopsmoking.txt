Quitting today for the last time.

Last year on Feburary 24th I had my first successful quit, due in large part to this sub.  I made it 9 months before the stress of my job and breaking up with my girlfriend at the time led me to break and quit.  I started smoking more than I ever had and I hated every second of it.  But I'm back, and I have had a smoke it 18hours.  This time I will make it for good as I now am convinced that cigs have no place in my life.  The only thing I plan on changing this time around is to be more conscious about my diet and weight gain as I gained almost 20lbs during my last quit( I have since lost all but 5 or so lbs of it)
Good luck to all of you!

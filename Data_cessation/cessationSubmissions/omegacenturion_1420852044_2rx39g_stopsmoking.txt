I'm at 9 days and I'm about to break

I've reached 9 days. I'm 24, and have been smoking for the past 5-ish years. I've made several attempts to quit, and went about a year without smoking a few years ago. I've never gone cold turkey until now and all I can think about is how badly I want this. My cravings are not a few minutes. They are constant and as of now all I can think about for the past few days. Do I really want to stop??

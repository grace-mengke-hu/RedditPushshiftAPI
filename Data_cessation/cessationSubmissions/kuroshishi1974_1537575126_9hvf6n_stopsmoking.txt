My stop smoking app sent me on a mission to list the things that have kept me from smoking. So far I have gone 18 days without a cigarette.

Things that have worked to keep me from smoking:

1) When the urge to smoke is very persistent  after a strong trigger, nicotine gum helps to get me past the craving. 

2) Vaping with no nicotine satisfies the physical urge to blow smoke. 

3) Distraction works to get past the craving, and focusing my attention on something else makes it easier.

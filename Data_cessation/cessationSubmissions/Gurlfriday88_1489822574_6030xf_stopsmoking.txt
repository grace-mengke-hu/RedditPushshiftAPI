Having a pretty tough go at this non smoking thing.

My grand ma is in the er right now.  Her 80th birthday is next week and she's not feeling too good. I usually smoke when stressful things happen but now I am at a loss. She's in another state and I can't get the time off from work to see her until next Friday. Things sound serious from my fam that's with her and I am so worried I can't sleep. Can some one please talk to me?

It’s been 89 hours and I’ve felt no withdrawal

Hey everyone, about a year ago a friend introduced me to an e-cig. I thought it was a cool gimmick at first and thought it was fun to try it when he did, but soon enough my entire group of friends ended up purchasing their own e-cigs. These contain 4.8% nicotine which is much more than a normal cigarette. So we all became hooked within a couple weeks in. I’ve tried quitting since then but always ended up caving to the intense cravings and withdrawal by the second day. I decided to quit last Wednesday since it was really hurting me financially and taking up too much of my time. Had my last puff Thursday morning at 7 AM with my morning coffee. And threw away all remnants of it. I expected the worst of withdrawals to smite me back to my old habits, but nothing. I’m on my 4th day, and I still feel nothing. Is there a catch? Am I supposed to feel it after the first week? Normally, the 3rd day is when withdrawal reaches its peak.

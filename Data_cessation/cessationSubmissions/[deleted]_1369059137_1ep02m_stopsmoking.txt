Quit smoking three weeks ago

Smoked three years, from 15 years old to now 18 years old.

Had a very strong cold and coughed like every thirty seconds, so i decided to stop.

i am very surprised about how easy it was for me to quit. i tried to quit before but couldn't even go for half a day.

it seriously must've been the coughing fits, cause from there on i was very disgusted by the smoke.

2 days ago it was the first day to drink alcohol after quitting, and i didn't even wanted a cigarette - awesome feeling.

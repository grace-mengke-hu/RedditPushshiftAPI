Another attempt, feeling optimistic

Hey, all, hope you're doing well. I'm 19 and I've been smoking for a little over a year now. I've tried to quit when I've been away from university, my longest quit being around 35 days a couple of months ago. School is ending this week so I thought I'd try and quit again since I'm home until January. 

I'm feeling really optimistic. I'm excited to exercise when I get home in a few days and try and tackle this habit. I thought I'd almost done it when I'd quit for a month, but I kind of forced myself back into liking smoking when I went back to school. Wish me luck. :)

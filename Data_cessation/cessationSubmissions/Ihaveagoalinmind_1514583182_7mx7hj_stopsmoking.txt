What do you guys think of vape products and cigarette substitutes like the juul. Need opinions. Comments are appreciated!

I've always been an on and off smoker and recently I purchased a juul. It's helped me abstain from tobacco use because I still get my nicotine fix. Was wondering what you guys think about substitutes such as nicotine gum and vapes etc. do they help. Would you guys rather quit cold turkey? Thank you!

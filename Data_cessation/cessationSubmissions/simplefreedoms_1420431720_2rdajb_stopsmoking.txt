Its time to end this addiction

Alright Reddit, been a pack a day smoker for 4 years now. I've tried to quit so many times its nuts when i think about it. I decided to quit today about 4 hours ago, crushed up the remainder of my pack then just now went out side and smoked a broken cigarette. Its just disgusting what these things do to your mind. Well, i went outside enjoyed my last puff and now I'm done. Got a 4litre a water some pop n chips n salsa and tribal wars and the new civ i just bought to tide me over, gunna go full hibernation mode for a few days. I got this.

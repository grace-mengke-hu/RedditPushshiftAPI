Tips for not being so crabby at the beginning of a quit?

I've been just over 24 hours without a cigarette and I am. So crabby and easily stressed out my boyfriend and I have fought 3 times in the last 24 hours. 

I'm trying not to lash out at him because I know it's not his fault that I'm upset but I just feel like I don't have any control over it. Any tips for coping with stress without a cigarette?

Leaving this sub

Quitting smoking is hard.  It's hard for those who choose cold-turkey, NTR therapies and even for those, like me, who vape.

The level of ignorance on this sub concerning vaping is astounding.  I'm currently having a bad craving for a cigarette and it was triggered by all the negativity on this sub towards vapers.

This is suppose to be a support sub, not a sub for self-righteous individuals who believe that their pain and effort is in some way superior.  I guess it's true that misery does love company.

Good luck.

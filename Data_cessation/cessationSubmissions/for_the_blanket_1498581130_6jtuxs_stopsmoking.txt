Any tips for the first few weeks?

Just as a little background info I've quit before for about a month, but that was several years ago. My last attempt was last month and I made it about 2 days. My resolve is stronger this time. 

I've downloaded a helpful quit app so I can see my stats, I have lists up at work all over my cubicle detailing helpful options for when a craving strikes, I even put around 150 strips of little reasons why quitting is better and I keep them in a pack where I used to keep my cigarettes. I plan on decorating that last one later so I don't have to look at the branding when I need one. 

Is there anything else I can do? I want to maximize my chances so any input would be extremely helpful.

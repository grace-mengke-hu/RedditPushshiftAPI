friend diagnosed with cancer, time to quit.

a close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer on tuesday (she's going to be completely fine but requires a lot of treatment) and though not strictly related to smoking it's more than a big enough wake up call. i'm 20M and haven't been smoking for the longest time but have failed to quit 3 or 4 times (although that was before i found reddit so fingers crossed). my biggest question is just how to resist a cigarette when you're drinking and what to do when your friends are smoking? thanks everyone in advance, looking forward to kicking it

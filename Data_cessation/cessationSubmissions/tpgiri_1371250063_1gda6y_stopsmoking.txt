Thinking of restarting after 95ish days

I have been smoking on-off for the past few years. Usually 1 cigarette a day, sometimes 2-3 on the weekends. I stopped at the beginning of this year in the pretext of getting my fitness up. I have been wondering if its such a good idea to staunchly say no, as sometimes you really want to smoke one. So I am thinking of going back to the normal way, where I'd smoke one a day (which aint really a rule or anything, its more like I smoke one if I am having a bad day at work). 

How big a deal is it if you are a regular smoker, but not the pack a day kind? I dont think its really much to do with my fitness as that part is still going strong, and so it seems restarting will not be a deal breaker for my fitness.

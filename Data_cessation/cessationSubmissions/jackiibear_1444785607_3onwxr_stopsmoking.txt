Emotional Breakdown

I'm in the middle of day 12 and I feel like I'm having an emotional breakdown!! It's bad enough I've suffered from severe depression in the past, but today it's really hitting hard! I'm having a big case of the "Fuck it's". What makes it even harder is my bf still smoking, so I see the temptations right in my face, and smell them. Not to mention things between us haven't been going very well either (and we live together). So I just feel like I'm stuck in this miserable place, I don't even want to wake up in the mornings anymore. I've spent the whole day in bed today. I want to beat this addiction, but I can't seem to shake the "Fuck it" attitude. I feel proud of myself for making it this far.... But what's the point??? I feel like there's too much other shit going on in my life to even be happy about. I'm in a major rut and need some support and advice. Thank you!

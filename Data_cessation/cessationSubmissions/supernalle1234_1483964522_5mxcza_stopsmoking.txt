103 days

Hi
So I'm finally over 100 days again. (quit for 2 years a few years back).
It has taken a tremendous amount of self-discipline to get this far.
I was struggling heavily with anxiety/depression when I decided to put the nicotine on the shelf, it's better now on most days, but still having my bad days from time to time.


How are you guys holding up?

Day 2 - no cigs; using chantix.

I was recommended to this thread from a “quit smoking app”. Enjoyed reading through posts yesterday during some cravings. I’ve been taking Chantix for 3 weeks and today is day two without a smoke. So far, harder than day 1 but I’m determined! :)  Anyone have any tips to soften some of these Chantix side effects?  (Extreme nausea, headaches, and weird dreams!)

103 Days in and Had A Visit From The Devil on My Shoulder This Morning..Telling him to F off

Having major stress at the moment with work, I could lose everything.. gremlin telling me go and buy cigarettes and feel relaxed..'Its the only thing you can lean on to feel better'

Even though I have an eCig which has helped me for 103 days.. Ive quit many times in the past, last year for 2 months, 5 years once in my life.. I don't want this thread to turn into an arguement about eCigs.

I just want to say that I normally don't care under everyday stress I can get by but this major stress is pushing down on me, I don't want to play Russian Roulette with my life, I don't want to trade my health for a little bit of stress relief.. all I can say is F*ck cigarettes..

Please someone chime in with some encouragement because I have this nagging gremlin at the moment and I know that once the major stress passes I will not think about cigarettes again

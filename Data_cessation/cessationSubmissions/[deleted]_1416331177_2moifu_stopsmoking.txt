24 hours cold turkey.

I have been a smoker for the better part of 10 years. Recently I was up to about a pack a day, unless I went out drinking in which case that figure would double. Yesterday my 5 year old son asked me to stop because "smoking is bad for you". Not sure what else to say but most of the people I would normally share accomplishments with are smokers, but I had to tell someone. Can anybody give me a ballpark on how long it is before I stop wanting to rip my skin off?

Fresh quitter!

Its not been a week yet, but what I enjoy the most about being a non-smoker (if I can class myself as that yet) is being able to smell my perfume! Never actually realised how stinky it was before. Now when I smell smoke stale or fresh off somebody it smoke it puts me right off any craving and makes me feel cleaner. 

Posting because hopefully the same outlook will help encourage. But hey, I'm no expert. :)

6 days in, doing well

Just wanted to post here to show commitment to my own progress. I'm 27, smoked for almost 9 years (though rarely more than 10 a day and usually around 7). I live in Amsterdam but I'm currently on a ski trip in Colorado. As my host is a cancer survivor, I decided to try and go the whole week here without a smoke. I succeeded with almost no cravings, but I do still fear that I'll relapse when I get back into my normal life. Anyone dealt with a similar situation before? Any tips? Thanks guys!

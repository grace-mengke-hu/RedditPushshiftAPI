The worst

Hey pal, 

A friend of mine who quit smoking says everyday something reminds him of a cigarette, and every day at that moment all he wants is to smoke one. It seems this decision remains a difficult fork in the road, though every time you have more and more benefits from having quick that you can add to your decision-making calculus. When you feel the struggle, eventually you will start becoming more and more sure of your better life in which you aren’t a prisoner to the cigs anymore. To put all this in perspective, my friend has been smoke-free for about 10 years now. Fifty days in, you might not yet be over the hump. And you’ve come so far already that your likelihood of getting over the hump is so close to 100%, and you will be on the other side of the bell curve. What defines us are how we behave when we struggle. You should be very proud of your continued persistence and rest assured that you will become able to manage what brings you struggle now.

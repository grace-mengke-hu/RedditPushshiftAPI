I just threw away my cigarettes and lighter.

I've been smoking since I was about 18 (22 now). I told myself I'd quit after I graduated college, and 6 months later, I haven't even tried once. I started off super light, and hit almost an entire pack today. I'm ready to quit before this gets worse. I told myself I'd never be a pack-a-day smoker, but it snuck up on me and it happened. 

I'm not sure what's going to happen from here, but I'm really looking forward to having more money and not being embarrassed because I smell like smoke. 

Can anyone give me some helpful advice for the next few days? What should I do when the urge hits again?

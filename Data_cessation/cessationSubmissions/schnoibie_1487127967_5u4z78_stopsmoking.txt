It's Day One.....again.....

So I had quit from about mid January 2016 until June 2016 when the stress at my internship, combined with an industry full of smokers, took me down and I was back up to 3 packs a week (sometimes more). 

But this is it. I just started a new relationship and I'm in a good place stress wise, so I know I can do it now. I don't want to be a smoker any more. This is it. Day one. Lets go.

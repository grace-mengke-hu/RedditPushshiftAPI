Woke up coughing at night.

So I had a scary reality check today: I woke up at night from a vivid dream where I found myself somewhat choking. Somewhat of the feeling of peanut butter in one's throat.

I then woke up abruptly around 4am, with the uncomfortable feeling of phlegm in my throat. I cleared my throat for 10 minutes, threw out the remainder of my pack of cancer sticks,  and began investigating online how much damage I've done.

I lead an active lifestyle (I bike 7 days, lift 2-3 days per week) but have developed a nasty cigarette addiction of 3-6 per day (at night after getting home from work, when I'd regularly work past midnight from home in addition to a 8am-5pm) for roughly 8 months. Before that, it would range between 0-3 cigarettes  per day for perhaps 3-3.5 years.

I've tried e-cigarettes with less than stellar performance due to functional issues with the device as well as even worse throat aggravation despite using it at low voltages. Nicotine gum every few hours seems to help quite a bit however, but I am slowly adjusting still.

Does anyone have tips on replacing the odd tic of walking outside  for a cigarette, but instead doing something different?

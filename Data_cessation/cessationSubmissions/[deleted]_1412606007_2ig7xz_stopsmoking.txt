Getting by with a little help...

Just made it through my first full week as a non-smoker for the first time in 7 years.  Of course weekends are always rough, but this weekend was a doozy.  Most of my friends are still smokers and, of course, we went out drinking together. I was struggling so much that I veered into that "just one can't possibly hurt..." brainplace, and I even acquired one cigarette from one of those friends.  Thank goodness for one of my few non-smoking friends who looked at me with a disappointed expression and told me that I was being really stupid and that I was better than that. After my craving-anger subsided, I thanked him and he told me that he was willing to take on the consequences of my quitting because he truly cared about my well-being. I'm dang thankful to still be smoke-free, and I'm a truly lucky girl. 
TL;DR - If you're going to go out and drink and surround yourself with temptation, make sure you have at least one person with you who truly supports your decision to quit.

After 13 years of smoking I finally quit.

I started smoking when I was 16, I never seriously tried to quit until about 10 weeks ago, I went cold turkey. The main reason was my deteriorating health. I started coughing few years ago which forced me to change my cigarette brand with much lower level of tar. The coughing was minimized at start but it came back with stronger force last year. I felt really dizzy while coughing and almost passed out once.

Apart from endless coughing, my immune system was dead. Flu was like a regular routine, met someone who has flu? The next morning I will have flu. I developed a severe throat infection a few days before quitting which paralyzed me in bed for a week. At that moment I decided that its time to quit before its too late.

10 weeks on, I feel a lot better. The coughing is completely gone, stamina is improved, my skin looks fresh, the sense of smell is a lot stronger, lack of energy is gone. I haven't been sick since quitting. 

I do sometimes crave smoking especially when I am driving, but the recovery of my health has strongly influenced me to not touch cigarettes again.

Just a paragraph I wrote for my self when I quit. Hopefully it helps you.

I wrote this on my phone and pulled it up every time I had a craving. It has helped me immensely as I have it wrote it. I encourage you to write something similar on your phone to help you through cravings. 

Cancer sticks:

There is nothing good about a cigarette. You don't need one, you never did. It won't help you through a situation if anything it will make it worse. It's a constant battle of keeping your nicotine level topped up so you keep your sanity. What do you get out of this? Nothing. There is no relief of stress, no crutch just a poison running through your veins and a devil inside your mind. It costs you your health, your wealth and the constant fear of being found while administrating the poison into yourself. It's a drug addiction, and the only way to beat it is to starve the addiction until it is no more. Cherish your life as a non-smoker as it is the only life gifted to you. Whenever you feel the need to smoke rember it's not you who wants the cigarette, it's the drug addict. 

Through quitting you will make your life so much better. No longer will you have to lie to your loved ones. You will finally be able to reap the rewards of the hours you put into the gym. Not to mention you'll be a lot better in bed ðŸ˜‰. Finally you can enjoy time with people without the constant need to make an excuse or wait while your having a mental breakdown for your fix. 

Never look back to a cigarette as if you miss something because there is absolutely nothing to miss.

Smoking to destress at the workplace (service industry)

Hi all! 

First things first, I guess, I've tried quitting a few times. I've cold-turkeyed, read Easy Way, used a nicotine-free hookah pen, candy, etc. 

I'm only 20, and I've been around cigarettes for as long as I can remember. Every one of my family members smoke. Smelling cigarette smoke actually gives me comfort, as it reminds me of my dad, who is my favorite human being. I've smoked for ~3 years now (holy shit, I honestly didn't realize how long it's been since I started), and I smoke about a pack every three days.

I want to quit for many reasons: I want beautiful skin and teeth. I want to smell delicious (but I live with two smokers, in a house that has been smoked in for ~40 years). I want my boyfriend to kiss me after I get out of the car (my worst smoke spot). I want to be healthy. I don't want to freeze my ass off in the winter, huddled outside smoking. I want this so goddamn badly. I don't need your stupid nicotine fix, cigarettes!

Sorry, wow. That got a little ranty pretty quickly.

This post has a point, though, I swear! 

I work as a server, waiting tables at a pretty cheap diner. For those who don't realize what that entails, I'm running nonstop for about ~7 hours a day, dealing with people who can just be quite terrible. The only time I get a break is rushing out back to smoke a cigarette. My biggest trigger is definitely work. People are so demanding and hard to please. They can be really mean for no reason. They can treat you like dirt on their shoes. I just need to get away and relax (yes, I know this is a trick of nicotine but it still feels relaxing). 

I guess, what I'm hoping for, is for someone to give me advice about how to deal with working in the service industry and quitting at the same time.

Thanks, r/stopsmoking. You guys truly are my heroes. You inspire me every day.

Checking in at the 7 month mark. Here is a run down of what I have gone through.

Quitting smoking is hard, really hard. There are a few things I want to point out to people who are in the process of quitting or have quit recently

1) Insomnia was a killer the 1st month. Barely got proper sleep. Melatonin (5 to 10 mg) helped a lot but made the days a little drowsier.

2) Appetite was all over the place, some days I wanted to eat everything and some days I was skipping a lot of meals. 

3) 2nd month onwards I started putting on weight and gained more of that appetite back

4) Anxiety was honestly the worst of it. Had random bouts of panic attacks, depression and just feeling bummed out. Forced myself to do things and fight the misery. Took me a month to come out of this phase

5) Paranoia is a killer. I was over analyzing every health condition, like why am I coughing, is my breath shallow, do i have some disease. I am fine, just my brain over reacting.

6) I developed GERD or some subset of it. Acid reflux is a killer for me. Have it non stop. Nexium or some antacid helps but honestly I might need to get it checked out again. 

7) Tried exercising but I am a lazy piece of shit that needs a trainer that I simply cannot afford right now. Got on that calorie counting and have been losing weight steadily.

8) Thoughts of smoking still hit me every now and then (especially after a meal) but they last like 30 seconds. Normally I chug some Fresca to get that throat hit and it has no calories. 

9) My skin is better, my stamina is longer, my drive is greater, my bank account is happier (although paying off the last bit of student loans is a bitch) and I am happier. 

It gets better and easier. Just yell no when you have the urge and run outside and take a short sprint. It really helped me during the hardest periods.

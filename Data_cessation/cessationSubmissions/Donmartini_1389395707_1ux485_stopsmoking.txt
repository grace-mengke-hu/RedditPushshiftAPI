The Start of my Journey

I have tried this before and always seem to fail. However over the past week, smoking just seems horrible to me. I am not enjoying it and constantly think about giving up. Today I purchased a starting E-Cig kit and am hoping this will be able to get me through the times when my body thinks it needs a smoke. Wish me luck :)

(When) Will my concentration come back?

Hey everyone, hoping to get some info from others that have been Nicotine-Free longer than I have. A little background, I have ADD, I used to take Adderall in college to help myself focus. I no longer take it and I have also cut out caffeine. For the past couple years, nicotine would help me focus. I work as an engineer and some tasks require a lot of focus and attention to detail. Now that I have stopped using nicotine, everything seems very foggy, and yes I know this is normal. It has been 15 days since I stopped. Luckily, my concentration appears to be getting back to normal slowly. The issue is I am trying to start studying for a certification exam and its really tough to focus at work and while studying.

Does anyone have any advice? Or any personal experience on how many days/weeks the fog lasts? Or if my concentration will ever be as good as it was before? I'm a little worried that my concentration will suck now that I have cut out all stimulants..

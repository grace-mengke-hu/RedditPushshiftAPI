Quit April 28 2018. Horrible withdrawals. Vaping Now.

I quit smoking April 28 2018. 

This is a battle that I have been fighting for 10 years.  Been smoking for 30 Years.

The first 3 Weeks were with a patch. But the headaches were not clearing up. I dropped the patch and the headaches got worse. At about 6 weeks I was going crazy from the withdrawals. Headaches, Shakes, Inability to focus, and Constipation. I almost gave in. I just happened to get a $1.00 coupon for an ecig. So I did that instead of the Real smokes. 3 Drags on that thing and the headache was gone. within 2 days the other issues were gone too. I only used it a couple of times a day. 

I changed the ecig to a vape last week. With the Vape I feel better than I have in about 2 Years. My chest pain is very reduced. The cough has cleared up. Most of the withdrawal symptoms are gone. 

it has been almost 3 months since I had a real cigarette. I don't even want one. I am done with them. 

I have stage 3 COPD and really don't think I should be doing the Vape but I truly feel better that I have in years.  

I am frustrated though. I have tried several things to help me get away from the nicotine and it does not seem to be working. Or at least inhaling to get the nicotine. 

I have tried

Losenges

Gum

Patches

Nasal Spray

Chantrix

Welbutrin

Cold Turkey.

I quit 2 hours ago and I want this to be my last attempt at it.

Been smoking for 10 years and I have tried to quit many times and failed. Longest I have gone was 3 months and then I gave in. This is probably my 10th or so attempt at quitting. I am going to put in all my effort in this endeavor. 

I would like to point out what has motivated me to quit again. Lately I have been having panic attacks in the middle of the night with elevated heart rate. Most of these stem from fears regarding succumbing to a serious case of COPD or emphysema. I am deathly paranoid of that and for the last two days the panic attacks have taken quite a hold of me. I have been so worried about it that I invested in a SPO2 meter to monitor my oxygen levels (Fluctuating between 99 to 100%). Heart rate has been elevated the past 2 days because I am afraid that I have ruined my life. I find it difficult to sleep because I am way too concerned about my lungs or that I am going to suffocate in my sleep. I may be overreacting but I have no way of consoling myself during these periods.

In any case, I will be checking in daily on this post and updating as I go along. 

Good luck to all of us fighting this battle.

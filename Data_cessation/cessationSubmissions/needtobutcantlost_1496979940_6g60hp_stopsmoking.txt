Quitting seems impossible

I've been a smoker for a year and a half currently trying to cut back smoking but it's really not working.

I've tried cold turkey and I ended up in a violent, self destructive and terrible mental state abusing everyone and everything in my path.

My breathing issues have been a major problems and recently after a visit to the ER the doctor said if I don't stop I will die. Even hearing that isn't enough motivation for me to quit. 

I am desperate I have tried patches but they only alleviated the nicotine withdrawals and not the mental cravings for something to smoke. I'm thinking about picking up a vape to see if that will help but I'm seriously lost.

Smoking is the main thing that keeps me sane, it's my favourite pastime and I live for the next smoke I'm stuck in a cage and can't find a way out.

Any help would be appreciated.

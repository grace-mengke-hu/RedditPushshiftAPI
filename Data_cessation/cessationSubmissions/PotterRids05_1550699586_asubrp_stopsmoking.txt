Just had a drink with co workers.

I locked my self in my office and it was so difficult not to walk to the gas station across the street to get a pack of smokes. It’s sort of pass right now after a nicotine lozenge but I really want to stay clean. I have been off cigarettes for about 30 weeks and occasionally my throat still hurts in the morning and that’s what I tried to remember after popping my lozenge...  Any encouragement would be appreciated

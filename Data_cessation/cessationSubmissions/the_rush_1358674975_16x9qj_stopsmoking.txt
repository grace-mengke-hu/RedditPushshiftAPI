Screwed up big time. Its okay though.

Stopped Sept. 30th. I went a while, and then mid- december I threw it all away. I was having roommate issues, stressed about the holidays, and generally not taking care of myself. I got myself to the point where I was dependent on it and it freaked me out and here I am again trying to quit. Changed my badge, back here for a while hopefully!

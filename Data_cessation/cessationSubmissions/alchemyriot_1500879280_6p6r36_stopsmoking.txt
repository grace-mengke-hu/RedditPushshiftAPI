Smoker of 7 years...

Smoking my last one literally as I type this. I want to quit hacking up my damn lungs every morning and feeling that nasty shit come up when I cough. I don't want it in my clothes anymore. I don't want my kids to ever have to smell it on me again. My boyfriend also recently started smoking this year, and when I'm just sitting inside relaxing and he comes inside and I smell that stale scent of smoke, it absolutely turns my stomach. That's when I think about what my kids must smell on me when I come inside after having one. My problem is, is that I'm a student and currently unemployed, just moved to a new area where I don't know anybody, so 98% of my time is spent by myself at home and I do it out out of boredom coupled with my Stress and Anxiety. Here's to a healthier life.

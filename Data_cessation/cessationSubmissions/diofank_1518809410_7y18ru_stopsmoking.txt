I took one puff exactly

I was hanging out with a friend who smokes. I didn't even want it, but I asked for one puff. It wasn't too bad but I realised it didn't give anything to me and I was freezing standing outside while she smoked. When I got home I got a massive coughing fit. Yeah, I think I really am done with cigarettes, I don't see the appeal anymore.

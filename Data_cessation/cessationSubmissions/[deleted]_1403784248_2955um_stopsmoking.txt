I never realized the stench was so bad

I was supposed to see someone who I know doesn't like the smell of smoke. Over an hour time since my last cigarette yesterday night I had

* eaten canned tuna
* ate pieces of lime
* washed my fingers with lime
* washed my mouth and beard with lime
* washed hands and mouth with soap
* ate minty chewing gum
* brushed my teeth and tongue
* ate another 3-4 minty chewing gums during the time I was meeting this person

I was certain the smell was camouflaged well enough, but lo and behold she could still smell it on my breath! I spent the rest of the evening looking up how to get rid of smokers breath, but I was mostly referred to websites explaining just how bad smoking really is, and that the best way to get rid of it is to quit. We all know how smoking harms us, but many smokers choose to smoke with that knowledge of self-harm, as did I. I guess what did it for me is that I was willingly making myself appear disgusting to my surroundings. So here I am on day 1 to a better life!

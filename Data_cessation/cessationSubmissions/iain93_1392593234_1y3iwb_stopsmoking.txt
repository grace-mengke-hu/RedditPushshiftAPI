Smoking in my dreams.

This is my second longest attempt at quitting smoking, my first was 37 days, but so far I've had 2 dreams where I smoked, the first one I smoked a cig and I hated it and the second one where I bought a box of amber leaf rolled a cig and afterwards I was like why would I do this? Does anyone else have smoke dreams?

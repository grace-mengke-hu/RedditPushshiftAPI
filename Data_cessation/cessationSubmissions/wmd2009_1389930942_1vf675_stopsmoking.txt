13.5 days in... HELP.

Can't believe this is a sub! Just stumbled on it reading a random convo about addictive personalities....

Anyway... 

I'm am 8 year smoker, failed a bunch of times to quit... Once made it 9 months. I'm 13 days in now, going strong, using gum 3-5 4mg pieces daily and it's going well. Wellish in that I really don't want to fail again. How long till I'm in the clear?  Will I chew gum forever? Advice? Anything?

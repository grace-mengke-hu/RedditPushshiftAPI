50 days today

So just realised it's 50 days today since the last time I smoked. I know it's not a big achievement compared to some on here, but for me, this is by far the longest I've gone without smoking since I was 14 (I'm 31). I'm doing this on pure will power. No patches or ecigs etc. The only thing I'd say I'm doing differently now, is chewing a lot of gum which seems to help (just normal gum). I already feel so much better about myself. Just wanted to share this as my first post to this sub.

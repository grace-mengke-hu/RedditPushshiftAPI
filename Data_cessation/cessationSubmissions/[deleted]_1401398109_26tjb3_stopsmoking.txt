This has gone far enough.

For the past 4 years I have been smoking 0-4 sticks a day. This past week though, I already finished 5 packs of smoke. No one in my family/my SO knows that I smoke, that is why when my family went out of town and I was left alone in the house, I started staying up all day just smoking while playing League of Legends. I played and loved the game since it was launched and I can say I am pretty good at the game. It was fun at first. The freedom and comfort that you feel when you don't have to worry about anyone finding out feels good. 

I felt "feeling like shit" occasionally, but I just brush it off. But then I have noticed another thing: I started playing badly. At first it was just losing 4 games straight, but it suddenly became rows and rows of defeat. It hurts me so much that I know that I'm not losing because my teammates are bad; that I'm losing because of my poor play. This is when I realized that the game I have dedicated time and effort became unenjoyable because I know that I can't play good anymore and it's all because of smoking.

I mark this day as the day that I will start to never smoke again. I write this as I watch my last cig burns out of itself. Wish me luck.

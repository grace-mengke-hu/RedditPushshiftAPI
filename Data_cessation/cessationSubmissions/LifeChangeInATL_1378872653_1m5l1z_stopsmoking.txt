Well I start tomorrow and I'm scared.

I got in bed forgetting I had just smoked my last. But why get out and make it ceremonial and have another? I know not smoking will make me happy. But I know when I wake up I'm going to be suffering for a while. Suffering from withdrawal. 

I've quit before and it comes on roaring. Looking forward to the moments in between the noise where I can be happy I haven't had a smoke in half a day. 

I. Can. Do. It.

Worried about quitting.

So I've finally decided after 8 years of smoking I'm going to quit, but one thing is in the back of my mind. The weight gain that happens to quite a lot of people who quit smoking. 
I've never been a skinny guy, I would say I'm probably of average build. I go to the gym at least 4 times a week, and I really can't make time to go more. I just don't want weight gain to be a reason that I go back to smoking. 
Basically I was just wondering if people had any experience in this? Or any method to avoid it happening?
I read online a smoker will burn roughly 200 calories a day.

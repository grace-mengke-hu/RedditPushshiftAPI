Day one: I’m quit! And here are my reasons.

**Because I told my dentist I would.**  Keeping my word is a huuuuuuge motivation for me, as I’m sure it is for lots of people – few people take pleasure in letting others down.

**My oral health will thank me!**  Speaking of the dentist…my mouth isn’t in the best shape.  I’ve had more fillings than I can count on all of my digits, one root canal (with another scheduled for next month), and I have severe periodontal disease.  I’m only 26.  My dentist has promised me she will do everything in her power to save my real teeth, but I have to quit smoking in order to keep from being toothless by my 30s!  Oh, and speaking of health…

**I feel like shit. All. The. Time.**  Seriously.  I wake up exhausted and no amount of coffee in the world can shake the fatigue I feel on a daily basis.  For years I’ve tried to convince myself that healthier eating and a work-out routine will help this, but I can no longer deny the fact that smoking is the main culprit here.  I’m tired of one small flight of stairs feeling like a frickin’ marathon run.  Oh, did I say “marathon?”  Interesting choice of words, because….

**I signed up to run a marathon in April.**  I’ve already paid the entrance fee and will begin my training with the C25K program next week.  Though quitting wasn’t in the forefront of my mind when I made the decision to do this, I definitely think that my signing up for this event was an unconscious choice to motivate myself to quit.  And I’m super grateful for that.

**If I’m going to talk the talk, I gotta walk the walk.**  I don’t want to get into the specifics about what I do for a living, but suffice it to say that part of my career involves helping others empower themselves to live their best lives.  A lot of what I do involves helping others understand self-respect – how to develop it and cultivate it.  I like to believe that I practice what I preach, but I have to ask myself:  is treating my body like a garbage can, participating in an activity which I know is doing nothing but making me sicker and sicker every day…is that a sign of self-respect?  I would say no, definitely not.  And finally…

**I don’t want to wait until tragedy strikes.**  My step-father smoked for over 30 years.  In 2010, he had stroke.  Granted, it was a TIA, aka a “mini stroke,” but a stroke is a stroke is a stroke.  He quit smoking immediately after that and hasn’t had a relapse since.  Of course I'm proud of him for doing the right thing and taking control of his health, but I don’t want to have to live through a “wake-up call” like he did before I choose to finally give this up.     

If you read all of this, thanks for hearing me out!  I look forward to hanging around this sub, I think it's going to be very helpful!  Cheers.

I need to stop smoking.

I hate smoking. I really do. I hate the smell, I hate me for smoking, I hate that my friends, who were much heavier smokers than I have ever been, could quit but I couldn't. I've tried many times to quit. I've managed to go a few weeks without smoking, but always relapse. I'm 32 now, and I've been smoking for about 12 years now. I don't really smoke that much, about 5 or 6 cigarretes a week. Any advice?

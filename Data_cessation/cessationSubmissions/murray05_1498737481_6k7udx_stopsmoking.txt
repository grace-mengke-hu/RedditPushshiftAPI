Two Months Later - It's Easy Now

Two months is not a long time compared to some people here, but I know that it's enough to cross the threshold. I am a non-smoker, and I have no desire be a smoker anymore. It's not a case of 'I want a cigarette but I'm choosing not to have one' anymore. I just genuinely don't want one.


Cravings? Once a week maybe. And I'm not exaggerating when I say they now last less than 10 seconds. It now takes no willpower whatsoever to shoo it away. 

If you're in the early weeks, worrying that the way you feel is going to last forever, that you're condemned to deny yourself a craving for the rest of your life, don't worry. It doesn't last! I'm free and you can be too. 

I'd like to say that lurking & occasionally posting on this sub was a great help for me when tackling the early stages. Thanks for that. I'm now channeling this willpower into weight loss in r/loseit, and I've lost over 10lb in 25 days. I'm now eating right, exercising regularly, and just making genuinely healthy choices for myself. And it's all because I put down the cigarettes.

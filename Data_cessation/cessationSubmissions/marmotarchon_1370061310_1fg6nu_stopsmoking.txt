3 days in, haven't shaken my resolve ... might actually work this time!

In some ways my life seems to be falling apart completely in ways that are impossible for me to control, in others its coming together like it hasn't in years. I feel like I'm on the verge of a character re-invention, and quitting smoking is but one of a few separate facets of that. I think this is helping, to not think of it as just quitting smoking, but an honest effort to be a better person entirely. Effort is the wrong word. Struggle. 

I'm fighting with myself, tooth and nail, to stop sabotaging my life and be the person I know I can be, to replace unhealthy decisions with healthy ones and do the things I've been meaning to do for years, but haven't out of laziness. It might be early to say this ... but I haven't been this clear-minded about my life in years. 

Part of that is to spend less time on reddit! But this sub helps. :)

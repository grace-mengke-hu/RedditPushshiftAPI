I have been smoke free for 53 days but seem to get sick more often

I quit smoking and drinking 53 days ago, after the first couple of weeks it was easy, I have no desire to smoke (drinking will no doubt make me want to so I am giving that up for a while).

I have smoked for 17 years, with the exception of a few 6 month breaks (each time I started again was mainly down to alcohol intake).

Anyhow, in what is close to 2 months without smoking, and with an increase of healthy food and excercise, I have caught a cold / virus 4 times now. 4 times I have had 2-4 days of sickness. I dont remember this happening last time I quit but was wondering if:

1) this is common

2) I am just unlucky and this has zero to do with smoking, I just caught a few viruses.

Thanks

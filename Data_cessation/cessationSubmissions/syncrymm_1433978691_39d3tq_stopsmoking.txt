31 Days.

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I've quit so many times before that I have lost count. I've tried so many methods; patches, gum, e-cigs, ect. Honestly, trying to quit smoking was even worse then just smoking. I hated it, and I was driven by it.

But this is different. I kept lurking here, on this sub. I saw a community who really supported each other. I saw people get past a week, some past a month, even a year.  Little by little I begin to hope, I read the Allen Carr book, listened to the audio, watched the movie. 

My last cigarette was on May 10, Sunday night, without any nicotine replacement afterwords. I have never been happier with this decision. I just wanted to say thank you all for having such an awesome reddit community. And thank you all for your stories.

going back on the patch tomorrow

I've tried cold turkey, I hate the gum, I was told the lozenges don't work so I haven't tried them. I don't want to smoke yet I do. My last CT smoke free stint lasted 4 days and 22 hours. I was pretty proud of myself but in the back of my mind, I knew I'd smoke again. I've had two quits that lasted close to  two months in the past. I don't understand why I cannot permanently flip whatever mental switch supposedly exists in my brain, my psyche, my heart, my soul, wherever the hell it lives, I cannot find it. I have quit countless times, but not really, if you take the word quit at face value, meaning 'to cease, to stop.' The state tobacco help quit line guy pretty much laughed at me- could not wrap his head around the fact that I can go all day without and only smoke during a four hour window between getting out of work and having dinner. I get so mad at myself- it's four freakin' hours, for cripesakes, what the hell is wrong with you? I've made pronouncements, enlisted quit pals, used apps, read and read and read articles and posts and blogs and looked at pictures of oral cancers, crapped out hearts and blackened lungs.  Lighting up feels like an unavoidable inevitability, like a bodily function, shit what's the word I'm looking for? Unconscious? Yet every time I do light up, I'm very conscious of what I have done and at that moment, it's ok. Then it's not. Post light up remorse. Oh, the word is involuntary, yeah, that's it. 

I wanted cold turkey to work. I wanted will power to work. I wanted to be able to rely on my own inner strength. I've proven over and over again that I am unreliable.  I wanted Alan Carr to work. I wanted prayer to work. I wanted that my lover's desire that I quit to work. Ditto my mother and other family members. My spouse still smokes and is used to my failures, sees them as par for the course.  He no longer takes my attempts seriously.

So I bought a box of patches. 

Thank you for reading if you did.

Day 1, blegh

So I smoke my last cigarette at 11:58PM last night. It is currently 6:22pm and I am close to for the first time going a full 24 hours. 

Stupid cranky as he'll this morning and I am using the gum in small doses. Only in situations where I am really hurting. 

Right now I feel physically uncomfortable and it's fucking with my emotions, but it's not too terrible right now. My wife has been really helpful in keeping me in check (at my request) so. 

I can do this I believe and, sad truth is, this is the longest I have gone. Here's to hoping I get a smoke free life.

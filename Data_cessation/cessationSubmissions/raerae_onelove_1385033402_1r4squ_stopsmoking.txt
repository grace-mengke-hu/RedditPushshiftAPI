After four months smoke free, I crumbled. So I'm starting again... Here's my musings...

I quit smoking in July. It was quite easy this time, I just stopped..for four months! But then I fell into old habits when drinking etc. I think it was too easy, I figured I could just quit again. Ugh.  Anyway I've been smoking on and off for the last 3 weeks. I put on so much weight when I quit... so now I'm fat AND a smoker! I'm joining a gym this week. I need to get out of this whole consumption/reward mindset like I deserve smokes or snacks. I'm just so unmotivated... I'd rather just smoke. /endrant

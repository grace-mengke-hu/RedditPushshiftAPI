Day 44 and I smoked.

Damn it.  I have been doing great, solid resolve, still using nicotine lozenges, but not many and down to lowest mg.  But last night, my bf was over and we had a very emotionally intimate night together and I just got super emotionally and felt so in love, so, said so to him.  He replied with "no you don't, you don't even know me."  

It felt like he knocked the wind out of me.  I have known him, dated off and on, for past 14 years and he has only told me he loves me twice, years ago.  Last night, I honestly thought he might be feeling the same thing as me after such a close and intense session of intimacy.

I made it through him getting angry with me bc I became emotional,  and leaving saying, "you always have to analyze and get heavy, like a switch, you do a 180, and I can't deal with it."  Today, he's not responding to me at all.

As I was cleaning, I found 2 cig butts, about 1/3 a cig each.   Smoked both.   Tasted like shit, but also triggered all the nostalgic feel good triggers.  I feel sick now, nauseated.  And, of course, I'm still emotional and sad  bc I knew the cigs wouldn't fix that, but smoked them anyways.

I don't want to start my counter over again.  I know I probably should, but I don't want to lose all the progress I have made.  

Sorry for wall of text, I'm just having a really, really hard day.

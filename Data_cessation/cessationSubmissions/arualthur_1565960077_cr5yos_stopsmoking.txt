I want to quit!

Hey Team!

I've been reading through some of your posts, cigarette currently in hand on a work break, and they're so inspiring! Well done everyone quitting, or who has quit, or who's planning to! Smashing it!

I'd love any tips or stories or advice or inspiration as I'm currently really feeling crap all the time at the age of 26 and I don't want to continue but I've had a shit year and struggling to stop - you know how easy it is to make excuses for yourself to continue...

I think the hardest thing for me will be the habit, or if I'm doing a hard task and I know I'll reward myself with one after.

Anything would be helpful as I'd love to be quit asap! I also have a juul if anyone has any advice on that sort of a switch. Or even going cold turkey. I don't want to end up reliant on that either!

Thank you üòÅ

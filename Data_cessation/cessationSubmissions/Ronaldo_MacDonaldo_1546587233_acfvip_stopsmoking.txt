Starting my stopping, i have a few questionsfor the experienced.

1. Any tips?
2. I started smoking pretty heavily as a teen. I saw a commercial saying that if you smokeas a teen your lungs never grow to full size. I am really worried about this because I want to try to learn to sing and you know, need lungs. Do they repair themselves? I'm really worried.

Any help will be appreciated.

When do these munchies stop? (Day 5)

Quitting for real this time (3rd try) and I've been coping with the oral fixation by eating trail mix. It's been 5 days and I've eaten 6 pounds since quitting. Can I expect the oral fixation to slow down at some point or is this another challenge I have to overcome to get through this?

Thanks all. This is my first post. This sub motivated me to try again.

Sorry guys...

I failed all weekend while I was out of town. I did take the time to read all of the comments y'all left, I especially liked the monkey one. I'm going to go through and read it again. I tried speaking out loud to myself about how I'm leaving this part of my life behind and I am not going to be a smoker anymore, etc.  My husband is using chewing tobacco to quit and Everytime I see him with the shit it just pisses me off. I own an e-cig(but hate it) but I feel like IM trying to quit on my own and he's got this crutch that's just as disgusting. He gets angry at me for being 'snippy' or 'bitchy' but he would be too!  Anyway, I'm just ranting now. Thanks for the encouragement im hoping today will be better.

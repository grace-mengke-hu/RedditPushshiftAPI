Today is day 6..I feel great!

Hi Guys,

This is my first post to r/stopsmoking. I've never wholeheartedly tried to stop and this is the longest I've gone since I started smoking when I was 18 (29 now). I've noticed i'm sleeping better and food is starting to taste better. My first pang of craving was yesterday. I had a big craving, so I jumped on the bike and went for a short cycle. I felt so happy that I didn't cave and I was happy to be out on the bike in the sun.

My question is, when does the coughing stop? I've noticed, every evening that I'm coughing a lot and then it settles down.

Thanks for reading :)

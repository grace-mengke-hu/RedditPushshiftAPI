Husband still smokes and I’m afraid this will influence me at some point

I’ve quit cold turkey 20 days ago and so did hubby. Or so I thought. Truth being said, I work from home so much easier for me, while he works on a construction site, so everyone smokes around him. It seems he still smokes during the day. Not as much as before, he says, but not sure what that means. We both used to smoke around 1.5 packets each. I’ve smoked for 20 years, since I was 16.Every time we tried to quit in the past, one of us caved and so did the other not long after. So you can imagine I’m worried. I know my addicted brain will soon start telling me: “if he smokes, why can’t you?” I hope I’ll manage to stay strong, but felt the need to put it on here, as this is where I come every day for comfort.

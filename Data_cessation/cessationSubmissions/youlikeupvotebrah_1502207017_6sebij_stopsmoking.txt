I had a dream about smoking last night

It's been almost five and a half years of not smoking but last night, in a dream, I was smoking...and it was so good.  Even after all these years, on some level, I'm still struggling with it. Maybe it's because I've been watching Stranger Things, and everyone smokes on that show, but it's crazy how smoking stays with you. I just wanted to share.

Better to quit on works days or days off?

I've decided that I want to quit smoking, mainly because of how much it costs. I've quit before for five years, but started up again at the beginning of this year after a rough break up. It was pretty easy to quit before because I was doing it for my now ex-girlfriend, but it seems much harder now that I'm single, since there is no one around to discourage me from smoking. I also smoke more this time around, which is at a pack a day, compared to half a pack or less when I quit previously.

The main thing I'd like to ask is if people generally feel the first few days are easier to get through if you do it while working, or on your days off. On days off it's much harder to distract myself from smoking, but although I can keep busy and not think about it during work, the cravings are stronger whenever I go on break. I feel like that is partially due to relieving stress from working, and smoking during breaks becoming a routine.

Any responses are greatly appreciated.

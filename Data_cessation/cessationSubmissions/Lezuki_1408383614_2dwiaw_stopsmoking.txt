1 month... thoughts, motivation, and benefits

WOO WEE!  I reached the one month mark.  Five years into smoking, I'd never thought this was possible.  With a little willpower and resolve, you can all do this.

Notes -
- I was nervous about what I would do without smoking.  Life would seem boring and empty.  Now, I realize that was a useless thought as I picked up better habits.
- I'm not tired after 30 minutes of working out.  I can go for a full hour.
- I picked up new hobbies and interests.  I'm exploring a side of my personality I've always imagined, but never acted upon.
- Whiter teeth, better breath, and smokeless-smelling clothes.
- Greater willpower in other areas of my life.  Cut back on drinking and started eating healthier.


To smokers who have a longer streak than I do:  How do you continue the motivation?  I don't want to lose the momentum.

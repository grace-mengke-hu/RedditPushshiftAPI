Nicotine withdrawal & Abdominal Symptoms

Has anyone else developed abdominal symptoms in the early days of withdrawal? I'm 7 days without dip (~1 tin per week), and there is still a lingering issue with gas, bloating, nausea, and abdominal pain. Perhaps I had relatively high doses of nicotine in my guts (swallowed, never spit), maybe that's the issue, not sure. Constipation, too. Ugh. 

Caffeine actually gives me weird spasms now, and beer bloats me, so it's nice to be forced to stop my other vices, too. 

How long can I expect this abdominal stuff to last? It's driving me insane.

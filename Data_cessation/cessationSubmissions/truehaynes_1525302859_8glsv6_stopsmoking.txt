3 days in and struggling

Hey so I've never posted on Reddit before but I found this sub and just reading through has been immensely helpful. I'm 23 years old and have been smoking since I was 16. I've tried to quit many times before using patches, lozanges, gum and welbutrin (which was awful for me). I began vaping two years ago and thought it was the best thing ever. I was able to cut my smoking down to just when I was really stressed or drinking. However I became even more reliant on nicotine than I was when I was smoking a pack a day. I felt like I needed at least a puff every 15 minutes or I'd go crazy, and I'd basically Chainsmokers the stupid thing whenever I could. Lowering the nictotine level made me just want more hits. Plus whenever the thingwould die or I'd run out of juice and have no way to get more I would just buy a pack and smoke. I decided to try chantix and I'm now ten days in on the medication and 3 with zero nictotine (haven't gone a day without it in atleast 4 years). The first few days were okay but today is just awful. I'm in the last few weeks of my undergraduate degree and I can't concentrate or focus on anything. My mind keeps telling me to take Adderall to get my work done but I know that would make it uncontrollable to smoke, and I worry about the interaction with chantix, which has been giving me lots of anxiety and depression, although that could just be art of the withdrawal. Does anyone have any tips that arnt just binge eating food and watching crappy tv and locking myself inside. I have no energy to excercise or really do anything, and my brain is going a 100 miles an hour inside my skull and all I want is for the fucking withdrawal to end and it's only been 3 days!!! I can feel my brain just screaming out for nicotine. Any tips or just kind words would be appreciated. I've quit other subtances before but this is a completely different animal.

Anyone use Chantix or similar?

I started smoking in January when my daughter was sexually assaulted. I haven’t smoked for 25 years but It seemed to be the only thing that settled the gnawing anxiety in my stomach. 

I’ve tried nicotine patches but they’re not helping. Thinking of chantix or something similar. Any suggestions from people who went this route?

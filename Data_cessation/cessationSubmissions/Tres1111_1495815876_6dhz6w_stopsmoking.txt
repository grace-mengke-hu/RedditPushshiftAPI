Day 13

Yesterday was the first day I am looking at a family holiday without worrying where I will smoke.  I don't need to have a balcony, I don't need to hide in the streets or in the back alley. I don't need to worry about the excuses to leave for ten min or worry about being smelly when I come back.  I can already see the freedom in no longer smoking cigarettes:)

I got mad at my constabt craving... so I went for a jog.

My work is next to a skate park.  It's empty this time of year due to weather.


My cravings are not ten minutes.  They are constant.  Biggest lie I feel like I read.  Anyways i just got so angry at everyone.  Myself, the quit websites, the cigarettes, my family  that I just walked out of work and when no one was looking I just started running.


I didn't  make it far, felt like my chest was going to explode... I feel absolutely embarrassed how out of shape I am.  But... no more craving just some embarrassment and shame for what snoking robbed me of...

If I can get over the shame of being such a weakling I might just take up running in the mornings... i just really don't want any one to see me wheezing and struggling.

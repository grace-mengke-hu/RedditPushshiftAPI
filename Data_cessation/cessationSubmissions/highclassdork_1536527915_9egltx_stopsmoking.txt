I've been trying to quit for 3 weeks now,

I've been trying to quit for 3 weeks now, I started out smoking 15 cigs to a pack a day and cut it down to about 5-7 per day... which is great and all but I want to be done with it! Any advice on how to just hang up the habit &amp; stop the cravings- or at least keep the at bay, or even distracted lol

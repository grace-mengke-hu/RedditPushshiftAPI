One week in...

... and PSYCHE! I feel awesome. I feel more relaxed, healthier, happier, and more energetic than I have in years. I feel like each day I can feel the poison leaving my veins.

Also, and this may be controversial to say, but I feel like I can look at cigarettes in a healthy way—that is to say, not seeing them as a crutch/need/integral part of my life nor as this demonic, hatefully personified object. They're just a thing, with very short term pros and way, way more cons, easy to abuse, etc.

We also shouldn't be mad at our brains, or at ourselves. I have yet to say "fuck you" to my brain; instead, I've just let it rant and throw a tantrum and have been patient, been as zen-like as possible. We're hard-wired to adapt repetitive, habitual actions—it's how we, as a species, survive. We don't have natural defenses or natural weapons, but we have knowledge and rationality and adaptability. Being able to systemically integrate information and abstract approaches is a big part of that. 

The systemic, habitual nature of the human brain is one if its strengths—smoking just happens to use it against it, as does any bad habit.

I think feeling at peace with your decision—not angry at yourself, or abstractly angry at cigarettes—is the best way out of the addiction. Forgive yourself, if you must do anything!

I just wanted to thank everyone here. I feel so good after just a week, it's like my eyes have been opened. 

To anyone struggling: Keep it up, the benefits do not take a long time to appear!

How to enjoy things without a cigarette?

I have been smoking for a few years, half a pack a day on average. I quit a few days ago and the worst thing about that is that things are not really enjoyable anymore.

Watching a sunset or rainfall was really beautiful and calming with a cigarette, but now it is meh, boring. Are there any alternatives, is there something else I could do instead of smoking?

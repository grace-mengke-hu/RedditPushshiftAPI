A few things i have trouble understanding.

So I have been off it for about 3 days now and i decided to go on the sub and get a flair as a subtle motivational thing that i would have to take the time to revoke if I started again. 

Then I started looking around, and there are people here who stopped TWO years ago! and they're still on the sub. Is it something you think about that often? Is it such a permanent fixture in your life? Do you constantly think great now i'm not smoking, but your brain is still thinking cigarettes all the time? Not to sound cynical i just don't want to be thinking about cigarettes at all in a month or so. 

Also here is what has been motivating me as a little bonus.

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;

So here I go again.  The other day, I slipped yet again, and am starting over and am beyond pissed at myself for slipping again.  I just want so much to be rid of this nasty, disgusting habbit.  

Beyond the physical benifits of stopping smoking, I have another personal goal helping me stay stopped.  I have always wanted to attend Toronto Pride, at least a good chunk of it, but have never been able to attend due to lack of funds going up in smoke, literately.  I plan on opening a second account with my bank and every day, I will go and deposit the money that I would have just gone and smoked away in this  account.  I figure that way I will have enough money to get to Toronto this summer. :)

2 weeks nicotine free

You guys, this is the longest that I've done. 

I've been taking antidepressants after I quit and the withdrawals are almost zero. However the cravings are there but it's very tolerable.

How do I tolerate my cravings? Well, I keep in mind that I'm a non-smoker now (and if my brain thinks that I really am a non-smoker that wants to try nicotine for the first time, I remind myself that I was a former smoker).

I also remind myself that there are lots of substance that are being added to the cigarette aside from the tobacco so that the nicotine can stick to our body longer.

Also, I remind myself that tobacco companies are getting richer or the CEO of the company is getting richer because of me buying their products. Well not this time bub, you ain't getting my money from now on and for the rest of time. 

I searched the CEO of the tobacco company and I always convince myself that if I'll buy another pack of a cigarette, then he'll be richer or I'll not be able to breathe properly again but that CEO will be out partying on his private yatch or something.

Also I do jump and jacks til I run out of breathe so that I can dislike cigarettes more.

Well, I will post again if I discover any tips other than this or maybe you could share your tips?

Quitting smoking is very hard but it's going to be much harder f you don't quit smoking. 

Thank you and have a great day.

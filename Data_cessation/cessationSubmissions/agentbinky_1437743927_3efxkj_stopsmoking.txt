Three years down the drain... Reset me.

I started smoking in 2001 and quit 11 years later in 2012. I stayed quit for 3 years. But I am in a living environment with roommates right now that are surrounded by drama, creating almost constant stress for me. So last weekend, there was booze, there was cigarettes, there were strangers coming in and out, one of them offered me one not knowing any better... and I just took it on impulse. The rush felt so good that it led to another one. And another one. And another one. Then I bought a pack... and another pack. And finally a carton. And after churning through that carton in a week, it really hit home that indeed, it's not possible to have just one. 

So, last night I threw away all my lighters and decided to get back on the horse. I bought some nicotine patches and applied one. This morning I called the local quit line for some coaching sessions. I called my local health department to see what kind of quit program they have. And I've committed to reading Allen Carr's book again for that extra "subliminal reinforcement" that he seems to be so adept at. I've got to nip this in the bud before it gets any worse. My primary concern, though, is that I'm not as "mad" at the cigarettes as I was the first time I quit... part of me really wants to keep smoking, especially to deal with the stress around here. But I know logically that doesn't really help.

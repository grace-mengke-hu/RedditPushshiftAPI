Dear Diary....

I just wanted to put down some random thoughts and observations, I don't know where this is going...

So, I found out today that I'm going on another long haul flight and it will be the first in my life I won't be dreading because I can't have a smoke for so long. How cool is that?

Had a driving lesson today (yes I'm taking driving lessons in my 40s), I moved to another country. Anywho, I usually get really bitchy by the end of the lesson, usually just after the instructor has asked me to reverse around the corner again.  And I can't wait for that after lesson smoke. I always need it because I feel guilty that I've been cranky with the instructor and just to *relax*. Funny thing happened today, I never got stressed during the lesson (not because I'm suddenly a brilliant driver, I'm not) and didn't even think of having a smoke afterwards.

Later in the day I was walking to an appointment and I was actually seeking out smokers. I just want to look at them. Not to get close, or to smell the smoke, just to see if they looked happy. It was a beautiful day out, I was feeling pretty good. I couldn't find one smoker that looked like they we're enjoying themselves. Every smoker I saw looked haggard, washed out and had dull skin (I'm trying not to say ashy skin, but that's the term that really fits). Even the people that were dining in the restaurants al fresco smoking didn't look like they were enjoying it.

Today what I miss most about smoking?

**Not a damn thing**

Right now.

No more ''one last time'', no more ''I'll do it when I feel better'', no more ''I'll quit monday'', no more ''I'll start tomorrow''.

No more excuses.

RIGHT NOW is the perfect moment, because I understand that there will NEVER be a ''perfect moment'' to quit this disgusting habit, this repulsive addiction that RUINS my self-confidence, my health, my youth, my faith. 

This is it. 

I'm scared, but I want to do it. I HAVE to do it.

Wish me luck.

You are never free but you can inspire people

Hi guys,

I decided to share my story after seeing that I quit smoking almost 600 days ago.

I was not a heavy smoker, but I needed my "fix" now and then. On average, I used to smoke 5-6 cigarettes a day. I was also in a relationship with a smoker, that did not helped when I was trying to quit. 

This relationship ended, which is a good thing now that I think about it, but that's another story. I then started a dark journey where I left school and  I was smoking cigarettes on cigarettes all day as this was the only thing I wanted to do.

One day, I completely stopped smoking. I threw everything related to smoking. Everything. It was during summer and smokers know that enjoying a cigarette while it's sunny has this "enjoyable thing". Resisting the urge to light a cigarette while being outside was one of the hardest step. But I did it. How ?  I took my bike and went for a ride, and I did this everyday. 

Fast forward a few months later, I met my girlfriend who was impressed that I quit smoking after 10 years of non stop smoking. Eh, i was never really impressed by it. While yes, this is something that I should be proud of, I was never impressed by it like people around me are. For me, I just stopped doing something bad for my body.

Then I met her father, and this was hard. It was hard because he is a smoker. And believe me when I say it was hard. I know understand how people start smoking again that easily. I needed something that motivates me to not start again, and I found that will in my girlfriend. And still now, I do it for her.

Anyway. Even now, I still want that smoke. Even now, I still want to go out during the night, while you can see the stars and only hear your breath and the cigarette. And I'll be honest, I fucking miss that. 

And I've come to a point where I realize that I will never be free from this. Of course, I don't smoke anymore, I am stronger than before, I can sleep, I don't smell bad anymore but there will always be "something" waiting. So please, for the sake of your life, don't ever start smoking. 

And you can be an example to others. People will see you as a person with strong will and will see you as an example, they will think "I can do it too". And you will be able to help them.

Don't forget that you are strong, and everybody has the power to stop being addicted to that thing.

Oh and English is not my primary language, please excuse any mistakes I might have done.

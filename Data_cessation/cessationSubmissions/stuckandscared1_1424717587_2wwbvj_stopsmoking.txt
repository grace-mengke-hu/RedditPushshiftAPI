I know I have to stop smoking to save my teeth but the idea is so paralyzing and scary that now it seems like im smoking even more to cope with the stress and anxiety.

Smoking is the worst thing that ever happened to me. I'm sure of that now. For a bunch of (mental health) reasons I havent been to the dentist in 5 years. I had sub par dental hygiene my whole life but regular cleanings kept me in good shape. That is until I was 19 and my time at my old pediatric dentist was up. I know theres no excuse and I dont feel like getting into the particulars but I just havent been since.

Now i'm 24 and am having a huge wakeup call. Over the past 5 years of smoking, shitty brushing, no flossing, and tartar buildup I developed periodontitis. My teeth are pretty good despite some staining but my gums are not in good shape. I know it was smoking that got me here because they are only really bad on my front teeth, the bottom front teeth in particular where most of the tartar buildup is. 

None of my teeth are loose at all or sensitive to heat/cold so I realize it's very likely I caught this in time to save them but now im so overwhelmed and scared i've become paralyzed. I'm terrified of never smoking again so now I'm smoking even more. I'm terrified  of everything else too (deep scaling and root planing, frequent maintenance visits, gum grafts, ect) but I know that for me to save my teeth I can basically never smoke again.

Has anyone else here dealt with a situation like this where the consequences and benefits are so clear but quitting is still the scariest and hardest thing in the world? I feel like such an idiot (in a lot of ways) but the fact that I cant bring myself to stop the thing that is the source of my anxiety, depression, and general breakdown of my mental and physical health is really bothering me and making it all worse.

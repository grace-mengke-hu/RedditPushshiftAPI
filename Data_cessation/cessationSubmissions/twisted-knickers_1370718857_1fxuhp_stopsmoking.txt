How I inadvertently stopped smoking

I started smoking at 15. 

By the time I was in college I was smoking a pack a day. 

At 30 I was smoking close to 2 packs a day.

At that time, the thought of completely quitting was absolutely unfathomable. I thought to myself, there was no friggin way I could ever stop smoking. So I decided on the next best thing: I would cut down.

My first goal was to cut down to 1 pack a day. This I managed with some help from Nicorette gum.

**Side note: 
I read some of the Nicorette discussion on some other posts. Personally, I felt that it was helpful in controlling my craving although(or maybe because) it tasted NASTY. I did not experience any negative side-effects. However, I took it only for about a month and never took more than 2 or 3 pieces a day.

In the following weeks, I gradually reduced the number of cigarettes smoked. Every night before bed I would "ration" the number of sticks I would smoke the next day. I even had a schedule planned in my diary for the exact time I would smoke each cigarette. It sounds silly but my "smoking schedule" really helped me stay disciplined.   

After about a month, I was down to 10 sticks a day and I felt confident enough to stop taking the Nicorette chewing gum. But even at this point, I still had NO intention of quitting. My goal was still simply to cut down.

It was only after about 2.5 months, when I was all the way down to 2 sticks a day that I thought,"hmmmâ€¦ I wonder what would happen if I cut it down to zero sticks a day?"

Well, nothing happened. That was the 8th of February, 2005.

3042 days later, I have not relapsed once and have absolutely no desire to ever smoke again . 


tl;dr: wanted to cut down smoking, ended up quitting completely.

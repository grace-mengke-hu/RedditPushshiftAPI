Insomnia?

Hi folks, new around here, was directed to come here for support via Smoke Free app. I am officially done with day three- I am 23 and I have been smoking religiously since I was 18. Lately, I have been going through a series of anxiety attacks, and just recently I ended up in the emergency room. I realized I hated the way smoking made my heart beat so fast, plus post emergency room visit, I sort off became aftaid of smoking a cigarette. It's been four days since that panic attack and I haven't smoked since. Although I feel great, I can't seem to fall asleep as easily as I use too. I am trying to lay low on taking Xanax for sleep (prescibed .5mg) because I don't want to get dependent on thay every night. I keep thinking that smoking just one cigarette would be the solution to my restlessness, but man, I am doing so good right now. Just feeling discouraged...

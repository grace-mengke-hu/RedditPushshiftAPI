Training After Two Weeks

I train MMA and I'd actually forgotten how good it felt.  I'd started finding it hard motivate myself to train because it always felt like shit when I did.  After only two weeks of not smoking training actually feels good again!  Simply by giving up smoking I feel like I have the motivation to get fighting fit again!

Horrendous Mood Swings?

Day seven of my quit. Honestly, the first six days have been significantly easier than I had expected. I just felt like the new routine of NOT smoking was taking some getting used to. However, this morning I woke up in the shittiest mood and I have been rather irritable for most of the day. In addition to this, I've found myself getting emotional over completely irrelevant things. Is this a common phase for people who quit smoking? ...and if so, how long is this stupid phase going to last?? It's annoying, to say the least.

28 years

I've smoked pretty consistently for the past 28 years, starting when I was a teenager. I've quit a few times and always relapsed. For the past 14 years I've hidden my addiction from my wife and kids (though I've been caught a few times). For 14 years I've felt like a price of garbage for doing this to my family. I've told myself I'm going to quit and gotten psyched up only to put it off and put it off. 
I only smoked at work during the day or when I went out of town. I would never smoke in the evenings or on the weekends. I've never openly smoked in front of or around my kids.
Two and a half days ago I unceremoniously smoked my last cigarette. I've had to fight my cravings in the mornings, my addiction trying to talk me in to heading to the store. I've been stronger than the nicotine so far. I'm confident that I can continue to be stronger. 
I've been lurking here for a year or so, I've started Alan Carr but haven't finished. 
I'm in my 40s and people my age are having heart attacks and cancer and I'm tired of feeling stupid for helping those things along in destroying me and my family. 
I thank you all for being here and I welcome any response. Be strong with me. Be strong for yourself. Be strong for the people that love you.

Day 1 - No smokes, no dip, no vape, no patch, no gum...no nothin'

No nicotine today for the first time in about 8 years (excluding the 2 months I spent in bootcamp). I started when I was 17. Joined the navy at 19. Kicked up my nicotine habit even more. Added every other means of nicotine I could. I quit dipping last month. Its been 30 days since my last dip, about 2 months since I last used my vape, and today ive already skipped my post-breakfast cigarette. Lunch time is coming up and I can already feel the crave for my mid-day cig. I just wanna be able to go backpacking and hiking again without feeling like death a mile into it....

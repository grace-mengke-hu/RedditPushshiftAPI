I used to smoke

I have not smoked a cigarette in so long I have forgotten exactly how many years. I just realized it has been over a decade. 

My grandfather died from emphasema, My father is dying from COPD. Both smoked half thier lives. 

I smoked as a teenager, gave it up when I was 20. SMoked again for 2 years when I was 30. Quitting was just as hard the 2nd time...

I still want a cigarette sometimes. But each time I think, "just one drag..." I know it does not stop at one. 

Stay strong everyone!

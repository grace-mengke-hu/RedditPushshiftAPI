I'm pretty fucking okay

I'm pretty new to not smoking (1 week ago yesterday, woohooo). But, anyway, I drank a bottle of red wine and two sierra nevada torpedo ipas last night, and usually I would wake up feeling like death... because usually I would have smoked somewhere between 5 and 10 cigarettes, on top of the awfulness I did to my liver.  But, somehow, I made it thru without smoking and this morning I feel pretty fucking okay. I never realized how big of a difference smoking has on a hang over. Its the difference between feeling like death and feeling like life with a slight headache.  So much motivation to never buy another pack! Thanks guys :D

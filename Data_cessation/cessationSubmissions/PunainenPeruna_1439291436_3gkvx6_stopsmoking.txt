14 hours smoke free ( need tips )

So 14 hours . Still not feeling the need to smoke but I'm really scared of when I start getting cravings . And to be honest I'm not sure how much I care about quitting . Right now I do it for the money because I can't afford to smoke and I really should be doing it for my health and other people around me .. Do you have any tips ?

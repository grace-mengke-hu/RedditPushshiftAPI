And I will quit today! If anyone wants to come join me on this adventure you’re welcome.

Wassup guys, first post on this sub! I’m M/20.

Been smoking for 3 years, nothing too serious, but I decided to just put an end to this bad habit before it becomes something more than it already is. I also started taking antidepressants last week which I read makes it easier to quit so I figured might as well. 

If you want to start this journey with me you’re more than welcome! It will be hard, almost fucking impossibile at times (it hurts just thinking about it) BUT day after day, hour after hour, we will be pushing forward and bettering ourselves. Because that’s why we are doing it (at least, in my case). I’m fucking sick of that smell, the bad breath, yellow teeth, no stamina.. all of this can fuck off, I wanna be a better person, the best I could ever be and smoking just isn’t fucking worth it. 

Good luck everybody, I’ll be checking in in a month I hope :) but if someone wants to do daily pm checks with me we can and I’ll be more than happy to be able to help each other out!

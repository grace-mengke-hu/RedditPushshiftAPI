Day 3 cold turkey and I feel horrible.

I've just quit one of my part time jobs because I really need to focus on my final year at university before I apply for a career. Now as a result, money will be a bit stretched for several months, hence why I've decided to give up the cigarettes. I will be saving around $200 a month, which is quite a lot imho. 

The reason why I feel so horrible is because I'm a moody motherfucker in the morning when I get out of bed. If one of my housemates breathes in the wrong direction, me snapping at them will be inevitable. I realise these are cravings but the thing is, I really don't know how to control my emotions when I'm craving very bad- I need some helpful advice please!
I find that drinking a coffee or tea in the morning is helpful, but I need some more advice. I really don't want my mates that I live with think I'm a dick and what not... (they know my full history of me trying to quit several times and they're used to me being grumpy)

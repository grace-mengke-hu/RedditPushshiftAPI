Day 43

and I am still getting massive cravings. At around day 19 I think I was absolutely safe, but all of a sudden I find myself having to concentrate to not reminisce about smoking when going out. I am really in trouble I think, but I am reading my Smoke Free notes and reading these forums to keep me on track. I really want one, though! :(

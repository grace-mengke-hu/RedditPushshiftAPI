25 days today. I cannot believe I made it this far.

The smoke free app has directed me here a couple of times and I have to say reading all of these posts really help and keep me encouraged. I did used to love smoking, but the last weeks, maybe months that I smoked I started to wonder why I was doing it and only truly enjoyed a small portion of cigarettes that I would smoke per day. So there came a morning when I decided I would not smoke today and that was 25 days ago. I know it would be foolish to believe I am out of the woods already, but I really am proud of myself.

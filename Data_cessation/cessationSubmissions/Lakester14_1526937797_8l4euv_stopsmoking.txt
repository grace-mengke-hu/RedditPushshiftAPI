Feeling Great!

After smoking for 6 years I’ve made it nicotine free for 2 months. I found that telling friends/co-workers that you’re quitting adds motivation to the subject. On my first quit day I told the girl I was dating about my cold turkey. She said “ha! We’ll see how long that lasts” she was the only one who doubted me. I can safely say I don’t see her anymore. Motivate your friends and family that are trying to quit, don’t bring them down.

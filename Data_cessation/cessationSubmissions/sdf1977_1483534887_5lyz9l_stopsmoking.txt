Day one. I can do it.

It's time for me to stop smoking. My wife is going to do it as well, but I probably smoked more than she did, so hopefully she'll find it easier. I started smoking when I was 21, I am now 39. 18 years. I have probably wasted in the region of £30,000 on smoking during those years. If I stop for ten years (given the rising cost of smoking), I can save close to £24,000, which is enough to give mu kids a start at university (if that's what they want to do).

Last cigarette smoked was last night. Only had three yesterday, which was the tail end of the tobacco packet bought for NY. Before that, I didn't smoke much over the xmas period. I could see the stopping point looming, so was getting mentally prepared I guess.

Apart from the obvious financial benefit to stopping, I really don't want my kids to see me smoking anymore. They are five (twin boys), so are very impressionable. They see us standing outside the house smoking, but go to play indoors. But, nonetheless, it's something they see and I don't want them to see it anymore. 

The second reason is that I don't want to go the same way as my dad. I watched him smoke from when I was born till he died at the age of 63 from a stroke. Two months after my twins were born. I think my kids would like me to be around a little longer than that (hopefully).

I am going cold-turkey. It worked for about three months many years back, but the one-off smoke ended up full time again. I tried an ecig but it made my throat sore. Patches itched. 

So, here I am. Day one. Proper day one. I have cravings, that's to be expected. Already declined one offer of a smoke. Time to get some lunch!

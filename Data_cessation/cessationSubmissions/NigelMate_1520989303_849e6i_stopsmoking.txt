I failed

As the title say I failed myself and fell back into and hard, pack a day, tomorrow is going to be a new day though and I am going to do it this time. I have a family to live for, I need to get in better shape, I refuse to let myself become a statistic on a pack to try shock other smokers to quit. This is it tomorrow is going to be the start of my new life that I can actually live.

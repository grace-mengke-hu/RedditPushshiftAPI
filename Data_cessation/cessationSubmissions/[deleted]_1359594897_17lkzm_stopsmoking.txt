The never ending cold - is it quit related?

I've done alright I think up to now - working out, weight under check, the urge to murder everyone around me slowly dissipating. However, the last 2-3 weeks I have had a cold I just cannot seem to budge. I am not usually prone to colds so this mucus infested sore throat blocked nose has meant many bad/unproductive days at work and cancelled meetings as no one wants a sneezing snozzer in their office. I have read on here people get the colds 1-30 days after giving up but I am way past that - My question is has anyone else had this and does it ever go away? Or is it something really horrible that is not at all smoking related.

Almost 24 hours now

I'm 21 hours in. This is my 5th or 6th time. Tried nicotine gum, cleanses, telling everyone I know many times for accountability, I've used Zyban, used candy, mints, sunflower seeds.

This time I'm posting here, downloaded Max Kirsten's Quit Smoking App and am watching videos on whyquit.com

I'm mid to late 20s, smoked for 6 years and need to quit. 

Day 1 in the bag.

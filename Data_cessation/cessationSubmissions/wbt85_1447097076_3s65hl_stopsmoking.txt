Hopefully this is the last time.

Hey all, I have one cigarette left and I have set my quit time to 3pm today. I have quit before in the past (4 years on chantix, 7 months cold turkey, and this last time about 8 months ago cold turkey.) I smoke a lot, about a pack a day. There are many reasons I want to quit. My father has been sick from cigarettes for 10 years now, I want to get healthy (I'm and avid cyclist), I'm really over feeling tired all the time, and I'm sick of spending money on them. It's weird as I type this I want a cigarette. That's so messed up. Anyways I'm hoping this time I can stay off of them and if I do I'll reward myself with a new camera. A lot of my friends smoke and the last few times that I have quit I locked myself in the house. Anyways sorry for rambling. Thanks for listening. Time for a lifestyle change.

Well, I hit the 4 month mark yesterday, can't wait for 6 and then a whole year!!

I was a smoker for 24 years, 1.5 packs of full flavor menthols per day.  Allen Carr's Easy Way has literally changed my life and made it feel stupidly easy to quit.  I want to thank everyone on this sub who mentioned it because I had never heard of it before I started following the posts here.  If you are reading this and have not been able to quit yet, please read his book, it really does help!

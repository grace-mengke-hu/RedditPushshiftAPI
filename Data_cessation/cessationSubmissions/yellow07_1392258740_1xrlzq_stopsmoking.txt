When did you finally feel like you had finally quit?

I have been a smoker off and on (mostly on) for the last 15 years. It is something I always have tried to hide from my 12 year old but I know she knows. On Saturday night a friend asked me to go smoke right in front of her. It killed me. I haven't smoked since that night. It hasn't been as hard as other attempts in the past and I don't have many cravings. But I basically just feel like a smoker who hasn't smoked in a few days. When did you finally feel like you had quit?

Quitting feels like a huge regret in my life

Hello! I was addicted to e-ciggarettes after addict to classic ones. I once posted here but deleted the story.
I don't want to go back smoking normal ones but I still have a cravings with which I can deal with but... they aren't like: Holy fuck I need to smoke NOW.

I'm on a crossroad.
USE VAPE <---|---> DON'T SMOKE

After all that time everyday I'm living with feel of depression, I never wanted to quit. I love vaping and I never regret taking them instead of normal cigs.

After all the time I struggled, I'm feeling like shit. 86 days without it and I have dreams, I'm thinking about it 24/7. But coming back gonna end up regretting it, it really feels terrible.
I never felt proud of what I achieved, only regrets and sadness.

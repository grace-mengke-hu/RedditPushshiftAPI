"Easy Way to Stop Smoking" - I really hope it will work

I'm at page 88 from Allan Carr's *Easy Way to Stop Smoking* and I decided that the pack I currently have will be the last one.

Today I'll finish the book and I really hope it will allow me to finally give up smoking.

I only smoke for few years, but since almost 2 years I'm at 1 pack a day...


Wish me luck guys, I really need this :)

Close to relapsing

I've made it six months, almost to 200 days. Lately a lot of shit has been going wrong in my life all at once and the temptation to smoke has never been so high. 
But I haven't given in yet. I've been running a lot, drinking a lot (I know it's not much better, but I don't feel hooked on Alcohol like I was on cigarettes... I don't freak out if I know I won't be able to drink at a certain point.) But still I can't help but think that just once pack would help me get through this tough time. 

So I am posting here, my favorite support group, and listening to any and all wisdom that you guys can offer. 

Edit: You guys have seriously been awesome. I can't tell you how much this has helped me. The drama in my life from yesterday seems minor now, and I am glad I did not give in to my urge. I can't thank you enough for your support, and I hope to continue to be an inspiration to the newer quitters. That 200 day mark is 5 days away, and thanks to you guys, I'm confident I can make it there, and then to the 365 day mark.

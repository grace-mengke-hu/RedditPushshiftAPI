Day 5 - sleep

As I start day day 5, my sleep is reaching tears both ends of the spectrum.

- Extremely deep with vivid dreams
- not able to sleep at all and mind racing like crazy

Last night I vacillated back and forth all night and finally said the hell with it at 6am and took the dog for a walk. 

I pay it no mind. I figure it's par for the course.

Hope you all have a good day and join me in not smoking today. Just today.

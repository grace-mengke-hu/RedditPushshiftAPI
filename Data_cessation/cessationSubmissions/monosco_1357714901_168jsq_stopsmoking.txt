Just had my last cigarette. Glorious!

I just finished smoking my last cigarette on the dingy streets of Zhengzhou, China. I am absolutely elated!

I have been smoking for around 8 years now, since I was 14. Like many others, I told myself back then that once I was done getting a buzz then that would be when I quit. Unfortunately, no one pointed  out to me that the buzz only stops because your body is well and truly adjusted to the nicotine at that point!

I've spent the last 5 years of my life smoking 1-2 packs a day, throwing up nearly every morning (my habitual cough antagonized my acid reflux, struggling financially in college (sometimes foregoing meals  or even craigslisting items around the house to afford cigarettes), and smelling like shit.

I've chosen now to quit because I will be returning to the U.S. in 3 weeks, and addictions are largely environmental. Not to mention there is no better time than now!

I know that the next few weeks won't be easy, but at the same time I'm excited. Each time I think about cigarettes, I plan to think about how ecstatic I am to never have to put one in my mouth again. 

Thanks for reading. I'm headed to take a shower and start doing laundry. Time to purge this smell from my life!

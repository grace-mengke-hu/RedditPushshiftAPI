All or nothing.

Hi there, i have been here a couple of times browsing around although this is my first post in this subreddit. My life has been filled with mood swings and anxiety the past few months that i had enough with addictions. Starting from 28/12 i will quit smoking, smoking weed(been doing that everyday for a year now) and fapping all at once. I decided to post this here as smoking will be the hardest addiction to quit. I might succeed and I might fail but i won't go down without a fight. Looking forward to being a free man. :)

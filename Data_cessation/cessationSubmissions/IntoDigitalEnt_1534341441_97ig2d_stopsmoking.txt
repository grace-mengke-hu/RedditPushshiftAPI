6 month smoke free

It's gone by so quick it's weird to think that I've given up for this long. Having smoked close to a decade, never thought it would be possible.

First weeks were tough, adjusting to not having something accompanying me through my journeys and going through constant mood swings. As each month went by I built up more courage and determination to resist and deal with it. I've had some serious cravings along the way but i've aimed to see out a year free.

Tips:
- why not give it a go and see how long you can last? I looked at my pack and decided it  was going to be my last. IF you do, then try smoking your last cigarette in the worst possible moment. I don't know why, but it  helped. I had my last few puffs, standing outside in the winter cold, with a really bad rolled cigarette, which I didn't enjoy and didn't want anything like it ever again.

- just take a moment to yourself and calculate how much you smoke and it's expenses. Here in the UK, new regulations meant prices went up on packs, so I really didn't want to be paying more than my usual. I use an app called : Quit Tracker which really helped. It gives you an update on progression, calculations and some fun features to put your mind of any cravings. 

- determination. Make a goal and work towards it. Don't give up. It starts of slow then goes by in no time. Sounds cliche but god you do need to hear it. I had friends tell me I smoke too much and would never give up. I smile at them now.

I quit half a month ago and now mind is messing with me. Need help.

I'm a final graduate student and I decided to quit the smoking habit because I started to not feel anything when I smoked. Being a long distance amateur runner, it also hindered my progress on the road. So I stubbed the habit about 2 weeks ago.

I did my research before quitting and found out all about the side effects of quitting and also about nicotine withdrawal. After that, I started with the gum--which didn't really help me--and quickly quit that as well. 3 days in, my withdrawal kicks in. I start getting unusually irritable and distant by the end of the day. This is because that's the time of the day I usually smoke two cigarettes and denying myself that somehow snaps my stability. This happens every evening. The problem is that my social circle usually hangs out during the evenings and my behavior is not helping me get their support. It also does not help that most of the folks in my circle still smoke. It is really hard to keep myself from smoking again when everyone around me puffs away like chimneys. I guess this frustration is pretty evident in my interaction with them, because they seem to not want to talk to me much. 

I'm starting to feel that this was a wrong time to quit because I'm in my final year and my social circle is likely to change after graduation. That would've been a better time to start fresh. But I don't want to stop my effort in quitting now. If only this weren't so hard. It's like everyday I'm trying to tell myself that I'm doing good, that I'm improving myself by quitting, but each day brings me closer to a point where I don't believe that anymore. 

The problem is simple: I quit smoking. Now I'm depressed. Or I think I am.

What should I do to keep pushing onward and feel better results?

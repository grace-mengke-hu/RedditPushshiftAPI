Happens every time I try to quit...

Quit smoking routine: 
- say I'm going to quit, but keep buying fresh packs
- finally force myself not to buy fresh pack
- Hate life for a week 
- love life for (fill in time period) 
- convince myself I love smoking and end up relapsing for various periods of time.

I need help with staying strong..I work out at night so I don't crave then, but all day is a struggle. Suggestions?

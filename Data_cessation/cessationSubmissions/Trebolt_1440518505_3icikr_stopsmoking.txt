Alright let's do this!

I started smoking ~3 years ago, when people ask me why i started I always tell them "because of friends". I was walking through the woods with some friends and i had the urge to die, my lungs felt like they would explode any minute. That was the moment where I told myself it's time to quit! 

Hope to get some tips here :)

And remember: YOU'RE AWESOME! YOU CAN DO IT!

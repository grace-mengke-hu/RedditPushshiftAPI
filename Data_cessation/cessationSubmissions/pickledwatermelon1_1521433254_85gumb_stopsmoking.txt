How was quiting vaping?

So I was in a pretty toxic relationship last year and finally kicked him out last summer. I was beyond miserable and smoked myself to death some nights. The amount of anxiety I was overcome with became unbearable. 

So it took me about 2 months to quit cigarettes and then I picked up vaping. I knew that with my past and my lack of coping skills that I created, I'd never be able to quit. I'm sure I would have though. 

So I've been vaping sense December and I'm getting tired of it. I'm down to my last bottle of 3mg and then will switch to 0mg. I know from my past experiences of quiting that a lot of smoking is mental. I feel like I've been in a rut the last serveral months with my healing. I still have troubles breathing and smoking anything just seems stupid. 

Did you find that quitting vaping was a lot easier than you anticipated? I'll admit that I am nervous about it because I live in a very rural area. There's no vaping supplies anywhere near here (like 2 to 3 hours away). I move here from a city in December and have just ordered things online. But I really have no desire to ever smoke either. I now hate cigarettes and they have more than likely give me irreversible lung damage for the rest of my life. 

I think I Just need some words of encouragement and motivation. Success stories that it is possible. Ive quit before so I know it is possible. It's just this huge lack of coping skills but I'm not learning any new ones by continuing to smoke this crap.

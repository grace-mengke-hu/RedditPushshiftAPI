Ive been smoking for a decade or so. I'm 25 now. I have quit 4 times. This seems to be the hardest time. I tried doing cold turkey. Lasted 12 hours, literally ran to the store to get nicotine gum. Please for the love of god tell me it gets better soon. I've been non-stop anxiety, coughing, and general withdrawl, even with gum. Love this community, definitely need the support right now. Thank you guys for everything. You inspired me to quit, for the last time.

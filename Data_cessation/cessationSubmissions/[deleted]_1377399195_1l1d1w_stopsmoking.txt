The urge to smoke lately has been coming back extremely frequently

I know I'm not going to but god damn I've been entertaining the thought a lot more. Due to several different issues going on in my life I'm currently feeling the weakest I've ever felt. I know I'm not going to just throw away 3 months of work within seconds but what the fuck! This urge to smoke has been haunting me these past few days. Issues with everything in my life; personally, financially, academically.  My life all around feels like it's in shambles. The more I think about it the shittier I feel. I know it's truly only myself bringing  me down but once I get on a negative thought it always spirals out of control until I hit rock bottom. Fuck!

My first attempt failed

Planned on stopping today. Thing is, I didn't my wife or post here or throw out my remaining cigarettes. I wasn't accountable to anyone and the smokes were waiting for me. So here I am having just finished my morning smoke. I'll try again next weekend. Didn't plan this very well. Got to set yourself up for success.

UPDATE: After much consideration, reflecting on everyone's comments, and especially u/Armison 's nagging /s, I mean encouragement, I've decided to quit tonight. Thanks to you all and this sub.

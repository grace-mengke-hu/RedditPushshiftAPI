Rant: stopped smoking but addicted to NRT

Just a big of a rant as I've successfully stopped smoking for over 2 years. 

In this time though I've been using NRT. Sprays, gums, lozenges you name it. 

I tried using patches and a really strange thing I've done now is parking half of it in my gums. I feel ashamed of this strange practice as I speak. This is the first time I've let ppl know about the patches. 

I've tried stopping but I always succumb back to NRT again mostly because I get stressed out at work feeling that I wont be competent at my job if I dont have it. 

I've had enough of this addiction and just wanted to rant.

Made a promise to quit, feeling anxious of going through withdrawal again

My 8 year old son convinced me to promise him that I would quit before I turn 30. I turn 30 on May 31st. I was in a really bad car accident a year ago that left me addicted to painkillers, but I quit those last month. The withdrawal was agony.

I'm sure it wont compare to the withdrawal from opioids, nevertheless I am starting to feel some anxiety. I just discovered this sub in a thread on /r/askreddit and thought I would try to get some advice on what has actually worked for all of you to lessen the withdrawal from nicotine?

Tips for last days smoking, please?

Hello!  I quit for 3 months and 1 month in the last year, and have had shorter 2-8 day quits a few times in that period as well.  I finally started reading Allan Carr's book and I'm about 2/3 the way through it, and I plan on finishing by Monday.  The book says not to quit until I finish it, so I'm trusting that advice.  Now, I'm pretty fed up with the whole smoking thing by now and I'm fairly certain my brain has convinced me I don't want or need the fuckers anymore.  

I was wondering if anyone can share their experiences in the last few days of smoking and can offer any advice, warnings, etc. about them.  I've read enough and experienced enough about when you have already quit, but maybe you guys have something you wish you would have done when you were still smoking, or something that helped you.  For instance, when i quit for 3 months, before i quit I smoked my fair share of shitty cigs and it really made me hate them.  In hindsight this probably wouldn't be the best option for many people, but for me it worked.  Maybe you would get one last cig in for something you enjoyed doing with it, because as much as you hate them and never want to go back, it's still a bit of a sentimental thing.  Or maybe that's the completely wrong attitude altogether.

Thanks for any insight and wish me luck on the journey!  Cheers!

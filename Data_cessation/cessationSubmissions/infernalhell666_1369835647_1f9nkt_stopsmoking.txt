I do not know how it is working, but it is.

This happens to be my second attempt at trying to quit smoking. First time around was 3 summers ago and I remember constantly, incessantly craving a smoke. Eventually, after one week I told myself that I am only going to smoke when I had something to drink.(subsequently leading me to drink everyday, just so I could smoke)

 After all, what other vices did I have? Grad School is super stressful right? Look its affecting my ability to do research! etc etc, excuses kept piling up. You know how it goes right? 

But this time around, after I stopped smoking on the eve of my friend's wedding about a week ago, I have not really craved a smoke. I haven't thought about it, it does not feel like I am making a huge sacrifice. I have no physical or emotional craving.

I do not understand how, not much about my life has changed, I am still in Grad School, with the same diet/lifestyle, and yet I finally feel like I am completely and totally free. 

I had previously never believed stories of people simply just snapping out of their nicotine addiction, but I am here to tell you that it is true and it can somehow, for whatever reason, happen. 

Good luck guys!

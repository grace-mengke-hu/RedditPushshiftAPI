Stressing I think

Hello community! Hope everyone is feeling good about becoming healthier/stronger people. 7th day is almost over and its been bumpy.
I'm feeling very sad right now and I can feel the crave pretty intense for longer than I'm used to. I've had a tingly throat and slight cough all day. 
I don't think my sadness has to do with quitting. Its times like these I have to start forming new coping mechanisms.
Pros: I am noticing my smell coming back. And that's so wonderful. I feel so dreamy outside lately. 
It could just be because I'm typically feeling in a better mood but I'm noticing small details in things? Like texture seems more pleasing to my eye. 
Did/Have any of you felt like you are thinking differently about where you are in life related to quitting? Just curious.

20 Year Smoker...Over It

Been a pack a day smoker since I was 19. Started in college as a "social smoker" in the dorm. Went from 4-5 a day to a pack within a week. LOVE smoking. Still do, but I'm so tired of it running my life. Everything I do revolves around if and when I can smoke, how to escape some situations for a quick drag or 2. It's exhausting. Tired of smelling bad, tired of these new wrinkles popping up on my otherwise young looking face, tired of being the only smoker in almost all social situations. Tired of not wanting anyone in my car because it smells. Tired of all of it. I don't want to die in 10 years. I quit once for 2 years. Cold turkey. Picked them back up during my divorce 8 years ago. I know I can do this. I've read Alan Carr's book and I've listened to The Craving Mind. The idea of being mindful of cravings really resonated with me. I'm an otherwise healthy person. That's what makes this addiction so frustrating. I've survived 2 divorces and the suicide of my brother last year. Surely, I can tell nicotine to go fuck itself and survive. I lurk this sub often and feel inspired to use it for support. Any words are appreciated. I just put my last one out. About to mow the yard and be grateful for this process instead of dreading it.

Just had to throw away my E-cigarette

So I'm currently at a rally for a potential new leader for this country. I've been to several rallies and they never made me dispose of my e-cig. This time was different. The TSA made me throw away my bottle of juice and e-cig. I originally switched from actual smoking to vaping as a smoking cessation method 3 years ago. I think it's finally time to quit nicotine in general and this was the nail in the coffin because I don't want to spend $100+ on a new setup. Wish me luck....

Day 4 and I'm about to crack

Just joining this reddit in hope of it stopping me breaking! I'm on the patches and it's day 4 and my day could not possibly be going worse! I'm inches away from buying a pack and just having one! I know it won't help but is it that bad if I break and just have the one? Like I'm 2 mins away from doing it! Don't think I'll survive the day in work with out going crazy!!

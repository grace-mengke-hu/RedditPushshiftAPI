Over 4 months smoke free, but feel a downhill slope coming...

Hi
Over 4 months I've been smoke-free now with not one puff ever. I quit cold turkey the second after my doctor told me about the problems I would face continuing smoking thanks my cholesterol. Fast forward a few weeks, my heart palpitations disappeared and I'm pretty sure life is generally better.

But, For some damn reason, in the last few weeks I've gotten these insane cravings. I feel like I'm restricting myself and sabotaging my mental state by not smoking. Everyone else can smoke, why can't I? It's like I don't have anything to 'celebrate with myself' anymore. Before, my life was built around smoking and now I have nothing. At first, I didn't miss it, it was actually easy, But now I don't know if I can keep it up. 

I guess it being summer and work not being so great at the moment are the main culprits, just wanted to share.

Have a great day everyone and keep going!

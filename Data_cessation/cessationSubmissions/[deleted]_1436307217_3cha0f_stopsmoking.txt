How did you set yourself up to quit cold turkey?

I am finally at a point where I have had it with poisoning myself with cigarettes/patches/e cigarettes. I had a weird epiphany just sitting here at work and I find it repulsive and want to quit, badly. I feel like I am disrespecting myself in a big way by using nicotine. 

However, I am kind of worried about the withdrawal symptoms. Do I just have to sack up and take it? Do I take paid time off from work for three days? Quit on a Wednesday and just hit the gym every day from then on through the weekend? I know I am going to be a fucking asshole towards everyone that I encounter for the 1st three days and I don't want to do that. What did you guys do? Sorry for typos/formatting as I am on my cellphone.

Today was my quit day. Instant failure.

I was fine for a couple hours then I started the drive to work. 5min later bought a pack and have probably smoked twice what I do normally. The anxiety got to me bad. I'm a 20 year smoker at age 30. I feel stupid. How could I fail so horribly? I've read allan carrs book, and quit for 2 weeks previously. I guess it didn't sink in. Blech. /rant

*You guys and gals are awesome. Thank you so much for the support. I'm going to try again, and again, until this monkey is off my back.

It's been a month and I think I'm on track for a relapse.

I just hit 30 days and honestly I'm feeling pretty impartial about the whole thing. I'm happy that I've quit but I know that I'm not fulfilling the list I set up for myself.
"Now that I've quit smoking I can get active again and start losing some weight!"
I've been sort of stagnant since I have quit smoking and feel that If I don't start making some real improvement or steps to improvement now that I have quit. I will have a bad day and say " Fuck it, I haven't improved anything so might as well go back."

Stopped smoking, still vaping.

Hey, I'm posting in regard to acquire an opinion or voice on this.

This is the second time I've quit smoking -- first was over the summer for about a month cold turkey -- and this is the second time, though I've followed it up by using a vaping pen.

The dilemma is that I feel like this is cheating. Has this worked for anyone without just switching to vaping for good?

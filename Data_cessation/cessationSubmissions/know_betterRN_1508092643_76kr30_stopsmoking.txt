I can't decide

If I'm doing a good job at cutting down or a bad job at quitting. I tried cold turkey but obsessed over smoking way more than I ever did when I actually smoked. Decided I need to try another approach and tell myself I can smoke whenever I want to but that I don't want to. With that approach, I had 4 cigarettes yesterday and only one so far today. I'm just trying to not smoke at those standard triggers like waking up, eating, going to bed, etc. Today, I've had one cigarette, but I split it up into three separate smoke breaks. So, like I said, not sure if I'm doing a good job cutting down or a bad job quitting.

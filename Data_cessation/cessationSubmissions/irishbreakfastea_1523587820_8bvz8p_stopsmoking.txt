Nicotine fit led to me going out to buy cigs, came back empty handed

Today is day 4 for me.  I'm taking NRT as needed (gum) but today was just filled with a lot of upset.  I had some major cravings in the morning.  Had one piece of gum. Then hours later I had an argument with my fiancee, which then led to me deciding to say F IT ALL I'm going out to buy smokes.  I was furious, throwing things in my house, searching drawers for a cigarette butt, crying.  I could have chewed a piece of nicotine gum but I decided that wasn't going to do the trick, I wanted the real deal.  I was going to go out.

I drove around for 15 minutes angry as hell, contemplating if it was the right decision.  I then decided to pull up to the liquor store.  But something was stopping me.  5 minutes passed of me waiting in my car.  Then my fiancee called, I told her my plans of getting a pack and she said, fine go ahead but your problem (our argument) is still going to be there once its over.  And that cigarettes aren't going to solve anything. I came to the realization that she was right.  If my plan is to quit smoking, there are going to be moments where I can make up any excuse to go out and get them.  

I drove away still craving smokes, sobbing in my car, filled with withdrawal.  But I knew after that first cigarette I would just be filled with shame, and the problems I have in my life wouldn't change.  I came home, popped in a piece of gum, and I am now cooking dinner.  I still feel shitty, but the edge is taken off a bit.  I am glad I didn't get the cigarettes.  I'm not going to quit if I give in whenever something bad happens in my life.  I can't believe I actually went out and was that close, but like I said, there was something inside of me that wanted to not smoke just a little bit more than giving in.

Day 4 is almost complete.  I am proud of myself for not giving in.

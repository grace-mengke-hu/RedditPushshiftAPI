Senses are starting to come back!

I recently quit smoking, and now my sense of smell and taste have started to come back, the only downside is that i have spent the last couple of day doing laundry and cleaning in an attempt to get rid of all the smoke smell and residue from my things. Any pointers on how to cleanse the smell of cigarettes?

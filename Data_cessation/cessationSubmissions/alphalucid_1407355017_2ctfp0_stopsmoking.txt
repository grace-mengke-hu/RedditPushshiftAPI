2 weeks =)

Wasn't quite as hard as I thought it would be. The wellbutrin helped a lot, especially the first few days. The times I had tried to quit before were much more difficult. Cravings aren't nearly as bad into the second week.

I was a pack a day smoker for about 4 years. I wonder, how early should I begin noticing my stamina improve? I haven't really tried any major exercise yet. My sense of smell and taste have definitely improved. I'm noticing all sorts of details in my food and the smells around me.

Almost about to give up. Help!

It’s my 8th day since I quit smoking and I am a mess. I was alright since this morning. But I have a very important presentation tomorrow which is completely stressing me out, along with this one very insulting comment that I had to hear from someone which is making me crave smoking like crazy. I don’t want to. But I don’t know what else to do. Help!

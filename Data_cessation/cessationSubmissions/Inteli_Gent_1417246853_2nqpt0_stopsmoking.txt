Just starting...

I'm a 24 y/o guy from California, finally going cold turkey (I've been smoking off and on since I was 7). It's weird... I've tried to quit dozens of times, but this time something in my brain just sort of shifted. I don't know if I can really describe it, but I'm gonna try.

Every other time I've tried to quit, it's been a constant battle in my mind between, **"Well, one won't hurt, just to get rid of this metalic, pre-vomit feeling in your mouth that's making it water, and that clenched up feeling in your gut, like someone's about to hit you, and you know you won't be on your feet in the aftermath,"** and, **"No! Not even one! Every one stops you and makes you reset. Every one brings you back to the beginning, and you have to fight the little fights all over again, just to get to the big guy, and if you can't get past this now, why would you be able to on the next go around?"**

This time is different, though. It's weird, I still have the taste in my mouth, the feeling in my stomach, and the unwanted, unwarranted energy pulsing through my hands and legs and mind, forcing me to think and act and do a mile a minute, every minute, making me anxious, figgety, and hyper vigilant, like the worst parts of a cocaine high. But this time, instead of that fight in my mind, I seperate the idea of these consiquences from the idea of smoking. I examine every bit of the symptoms of withdrawl, and try to remember how my brain was before, compared to now. I take all that information, and I emotionally look at it logically. I think to myself, "This really isn't that bad. It doesn't hurt. It's uncomfortable, but I've been uncomfortable before. It's inconvinient, but I've been inconvinienced more times than I can count. It's just a way that my body is right now, and if I had to go through my whole life with my body feeling like this, I could manage. If there was no way to alleviate these feelings, they wouldn't kill me, or hold me back from enjoying my life in anyway. I can live with this, and so I will."

And I sort of... trick myself? That's a bad way to put it, but the best I can think of. I trick myself into believing (or at least acting as if I believe) that smoking a cigarette won't change how I feel. Smoking won't make this anxiousness go away, and it won't relieve the taste, almost a combination of blood and bile, from my mouth.

And if I try *really* hard, I can even sort of convince myself that the feeling in my stomach is good. Not entirely good, but reminesant of the first time you go on a date with someone you really love, and you say something that's just so witty and perfect, and they just sort of chuckle, and you feel like you've ruined everything. Later on, when you're happy again, you look back on that feeling, and you remember it with gladness. You remember it as the joyious naievete of a child, and it's a happy memory. So I try my best to imagine this feeling from the future, when it's done, and remember my present as a distant past, in which I've already overcome these obstacles, and what pain there is to remember is the pain of knowing I'd done something that I thought impossible.

**This is the important bit:** Anyway, I'm sorry that this got so rambly. I really didn't intend it to. All I really came here to say was, I'm crazy bored at work, and I wanna find someone to talk to while I pass the time. I've gone from a pack and a half a day, to nothing now, for about 16 hours, so I'm passing over the worst of it. If I can get past this and still keep this possitive, non-combative mind set, I think I'll do just fine. :)

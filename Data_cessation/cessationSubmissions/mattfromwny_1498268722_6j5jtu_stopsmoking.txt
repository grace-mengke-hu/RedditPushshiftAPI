2 years smoking and vaping...how screwed am I?

I'm an otherwise healthy 25 year old male. I smoked cigarettes for a little over a year and then used ecigs to gradually wean off. Finally I have quit nicotine completely 2 years later. I haven't noticed any big problems yet but I am worried particularly with regard to erectile dysfunction as they say nicotine can cause that. What do you think my likelihood of permanent damage is?

Day 9 and I'm losing it.

I've been nicotine free for nine days. These past three have really stepped their game up. *Cravings intensify.* I'm fighting with my partner and we're already long distance. I'm afraid I'm going to lose her which makes everything harder. My job is challenging me. I don't have a solid community where I live. I need people and support so badly right now and simultaneously hate everyone. Someone halp!

Quitting Smoking and Depression

So I quit around 61 days ago ... But

first some history:

I have suffered in the past from depression that needed treatment. The depression was accompanied by muscle aches and anxiety. I was on and off a ton of medication before I settled on a combination of 2 antidepressants.

I was doing well  the last 2 years that I weaned off one of the medications. 

Shortly after I quit smoking, things took a turn to the worst.  Anxiety , irritability, muscle aches and pain, and ... depression. I have also noticed that I stare at people smoking with envy, so i googled "quit smoking and depression" and here is what I found out

I don't want to go back to smoking. I went back to the medication I weaned off, but its not helping so far. I have no Idea what do now. I'm visiting my doctor tomorrow.

I'd appreciate any kind of feedback

Do you believe people claiming to smoke 100+ cigarettes a day ?

Hey everyone.

I don't know why but often people tend to fake the number of cigarettes they (or used to) smoke.

I might have smoked 100 cigs in a day maybe one or twice in my life (not even sure), I don't say it's impossible to do but doing it daily sorry but I call it bullshit.

I saw my grandfather chain smoking like no one else, and he hardly reached 4 packs a day which is crazy (he paid for it later in his life...).

Now I see people like Alan Carr claiming to smoke up to 100 cigarettes daily, which for me is highly exaggerated to sell more/have more legitimacy. I don't see how someone could smoke a cigarette every 10 minutes for ALL DAY LONG. Smoking 6 cigarettes an hour is nothing, but doing it for 18 hours straight without stopping once and doing it every single day is something else.

Now if you take in consideration that you can't just chain smoke, you have to do other things like eat, drink, doing various tasks... It's more realistic to say it's more like 10+ cigs an hour.

What do you guys think about it?

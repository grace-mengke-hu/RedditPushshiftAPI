No cravings but really stressed and irritable and can't sleep!

Hi .. not sure what I'm seeking in posting here but am 3 days now w no tobacco (and nearly 17 days w no cannabis!) .. I'm actually not craving at all which is awesome, but I'm hiiighly irritable and stressed, and feel so bad as I have my daughter this week (shared custody) and despite my best efforts am being so grumpy and quick to be stressed and irritable with and around her! She's only pretty little and doesn't deserve to bare the brunt of my withdrawals but am just finding the relentlessness of parenting really wearing ! Really hoping tomorrow is somehow gonna be a bit easier !? Thanks!

Quitting halfway through the day?

So I've been wanting to quit for several weeks now, but I always put it off. Today, however, I really feel the drive to quit. The problem, however, is that I already smoked a few today. I wish I hadn't so that I could start the day fresh, and now I'm afraid that it will be so much more difficult if I just stop now. I'm also telling myself that I'll quit tomorrow, but I don't know if I'll have the willpower.

I also work for the next three days, 12 hour shifts as an overnight worker. I know this would help keep me busy, but I'm also afraid of going through those 12 hours in withdrawal. 

I don't know, what do you all think? Should I do it now even though I already started the day smoking, or should I make sure to start tomorrow?

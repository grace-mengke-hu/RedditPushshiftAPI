Who wants to be my quitting buddy

I'm 32 now, started when I was 21, in Cuba, a cute girl asked me to buy her some. I coughed the pack down, she asked do you smoke, I said yes (she knew I was lying). I quit from ages 25-29 and then started again at some stressful job. Anyway I quit and personally cold Turkey is the only thing that worked.  Need a buddy for accountability, I've been smoking black and milds for weeks because I dont want to buy a pack, gross

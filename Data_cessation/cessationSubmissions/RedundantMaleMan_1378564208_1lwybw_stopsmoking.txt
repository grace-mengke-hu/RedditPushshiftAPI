Am I living a pipe dream (pun intended) if I quit smoking cigarettes but continue smoking cannabis?

I have been cigarette free for coming up on a week now, but I am afraid that I am missing out on any major health benefits because I continue using cannabis. I am not a heavy cannabis user, but my preferred method is lung busting bong rips. Though I do smoke everyday, it is usually 1-2 bowls in the evening time to wind down from the day and to help me sleep. I suffer from severe anxiety and insomnia from my days in the military, and have no desire to, nor do I see any benefit to stop using cannabis. Since I know the benefits cannabis has had for me over the years conflicts with the harm that consuming anything through combustion causes, I have been looking into alternative methods (ie vaporizers and edibles). Edibles tend to be  a little too strong for me, so I am leaning more towards a good vaporizer once I can get some money saved up. Basically my question is this, should I continue to pat myself on the back for quitting cigarettes, or should I see quitting cigarettes as merely a stepping stone on the path to better health and that journey will only be complete when I stop smoking cannabis? Also, does anyone know of any good studies on the negative effects of smoking cannabis when compared to smoking cigarettes? All the information I can find is never sourced and questionable at best. Thanks for you help guys and if you don't have any information to pass along, a bit of encouragement is always welcome too.

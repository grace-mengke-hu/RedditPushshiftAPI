I have a few quit questions. (related to vision)

I have quit probably once a week for about four years now. I am on hour 12 right now. Probably the longest I have gone since I was 20. I smoke a little over a pack a day of Pall Mall Reds, or Camel Filters, none of that pussy shit. Sometimes I switch over to studs if I am feeling extra stupid. Anyway, I am on hour 12 and my eye aren't focusing real well. I am having trouble playing video games or do anything really. Has anyone experienced this?

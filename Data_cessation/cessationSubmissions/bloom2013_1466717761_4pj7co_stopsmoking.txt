I want to punch someone so bad

I'm doing fine until I meet people. These last days I've had relatively few, manageable cravings. I work at home, so when I'm here it's like a heaven where I don't even think about smoking... but as soon as I leave the house! MAN! The triggers!! I want to kill everyone!
I have such a short fuse. I went to see my parents for lunch but I had to leave after 20 min, before even ordering, because I was being unbearable. I could hear myself being a bitch but I couldn't stop myself, which made me even more angry. I hope I remember that relapsing will mean two to four weeks of anger whenever I feel tempted to have a smoke in the future.

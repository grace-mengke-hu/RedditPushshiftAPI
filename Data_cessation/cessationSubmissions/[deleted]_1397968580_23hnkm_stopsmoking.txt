The mental strength

We all have the physical strength to walk over to that pack, take one out, and light it up. It'd even feel natural, in fact. I could do it right now. I can see the pack in my head. I know how many cigarettes are even in it.

But wait-- I've come so far. I decided that today was going to be a start of a new life style. If I don't make this change today, then when? Do I give in today and continue on telling myself that I NEED TO QUIT and then burden myself on some other day of my life with this task when I've already made it a whole... 22 hours?

I'm not used to not smoking. This is an odd feeling for me. I'm the sort of guy who needs to know smokes are available at all time or it makes me feel uneasy. I buy them in packs of threes and I always make sure there is a spare pack in the car. and two lighters.

I've quit before for 10 months. It wasn't a lasting change though. I don't remember the reason for starting back up.. or rather, that's what I tell people when they ask why I started up again. I don't like to tell them the real reason. I lack the mental strength

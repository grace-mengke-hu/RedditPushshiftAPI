Officially Going on the Wagon...

Ive finally come to terms with the fact that in order to quit smoking successfully, I am going to have to give up alcohol. I can honestly say that almost every time Ive relapsed in the past 3 years has been because Ive gone out, gotten intoxicated and ended up at a store buying  pack. So no more, I am so tired of the cycle. I dunno if this means Im giving up alcohol for good, but it will definitely be more beneficial to my health to nix them both. Maybe I'll find in the end that both vices are not truly worth it and live a happier life.

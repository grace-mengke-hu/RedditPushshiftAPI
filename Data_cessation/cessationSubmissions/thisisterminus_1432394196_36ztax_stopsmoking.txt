One month today. Still feel rough but pushing on

So it's 30 days today. I'm still recovery from the pneumonia that made me stop (and I'm so glad it did). Another couple of weeks and I should be fine. I never want to go through that pain again or the pain of relying on a substance to make me feel OK.

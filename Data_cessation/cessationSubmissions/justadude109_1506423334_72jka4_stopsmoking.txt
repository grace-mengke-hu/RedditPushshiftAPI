Feeling cold all the time... is it normal??

Is it normal to feel cold after you quit smoking? It feels like my metabolism slows down and the body isn't creating enough heat .. aah.. I can't explain it clearly. I even relapsed to find out whether smoking is the cause, and the chills ALWAYS start after I quit.. It basically lasted the whole 12 days I was quit last time (yeah, not much I know). I went to sauna and I could stay in the 200F heat for considerably longer than usual. It helped, but after an hour or so the chillness started again. I don't have any illness or infection, at least none that I'm aware of and my thyroid should be fine. Has anyone else experienced this? Does the cold feeling eventually goes away?

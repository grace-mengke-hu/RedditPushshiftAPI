Weed

Hi, I'm on day 3 of this stop smoking and I feel fine so far.

I am getting worried though! When I go off to college I will probably smoke weed (don't want to be considered a 'nerd'). Will I be able to do this without affecting my health? Also, does smoking weed straight affect the lungs that much?

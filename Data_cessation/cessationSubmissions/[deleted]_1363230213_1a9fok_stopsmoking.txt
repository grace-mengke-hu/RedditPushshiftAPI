16 y/o been smoking 2-3 years consistently, what now?

So I've decided it's time to make a life changing decision and quit smoking as I've noticed lately I'm experiencing very persistent rough coughs.

I've been smoking for 2-3 years now (about 3/4ths of a pack a day for the last year) and was wondering what exactly should I do to help myself succeed? What should I expect? How do I avoid cravings and impulses from situations where I'd normally light up?

I got what I deserved

So, I've been trying my hardest to quit smoking. Three days ago I didn't even buy any on the way to work. Well, I got irritated at work and wanted a cig really bad. I work 3rd shift in a building, and no one else is around. My dumb ass took a pair of scissors out to the smoking area and cut half the filter off of someones disposed cigarette. Needless to say, I've been very sick for the last three days. That's what I get...I'm a germaphobe and I knew better but I just had to have that nicotine. Let me have it, I know I'm a dipshit.

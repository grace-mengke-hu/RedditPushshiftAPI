I want to QUIT!

Hey there everyone! So I have made a few attempts to quit smoking in 2018. None were successful. I want 2019 to be my year to quit once and for all. My quit date is Friday January 4th. Posting here to see if any of you have advice or an app. Suggestion for me. Anything will help. Please and thank you!

Almost Day 5 and no one has died

Been a smoker for past 15 years when I drank and then 2 years ago after moving, 5-10 avg a day. I’ve quit in the past, longest was 2yrs. I gave myself my own quit date and by no pressure of my wife. Quit cold turkey. Found app Smoke Free on iOS and has really helped kind of make it a game for me. Haven’t had a hard night of drinking yet, so will be true test. Told wife I might have to clutch and get an e-cig (do they still make throw away ones?). But I’m trying to quit it all. 

Ps, one thing I hate about not smoking is how well my smell is. I’ll adjust. Like wow, didn’t realize that was something that was lost while smoking.

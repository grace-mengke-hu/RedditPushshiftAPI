40 Days here checking in

So I smoked about a half a pack a day for over 10 years.  I quit cold turkey 40 days ago and have not had a puff since.  The first 3 weeks were tough for me, especially that first week (which included the first beer), but after those 3 weeks the cravings have dropped dramatically and as of this day I barely have any at all.  I go through most days now without even thinking about cigarettes at all.  It's really a great feeling.  I would like to thank everyone in this sub for sharing their stories.....good and bad.

So people out there who are in the first couple weeks, IT GETS EASIER! and very soon.  I promise.  Just take it one day at a time and ENDURE.  You got this!

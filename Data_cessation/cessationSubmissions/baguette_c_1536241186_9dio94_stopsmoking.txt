Going for a run now

I am 22 years old from Austria, currently working as a paramedic. I smoked for 4 years. It got worse when I had to make mandatory service for the red cross as a medic, because everyone, from the medics to the nurses, all smoked and it was/is a stressfull job with lots of nightshifts and long car rides where you just want to smoke afterwards.

Then I started studying chemical engineering and the courses where tough, so I had trouble stopping. 

I now worked as a medic agian for the red cross for a month and it all came back. The stress of the job. In yesterdays nightshift I smoked a whole pack and started coughing. I feel like shit but I am afraid what will happen when I stop and I get stress or something. With me luck, I am going for a run.

That was a strange 6 years. (TL:DR included)

I'm a 21 year old University student with a job and a full time course that provides plenty of stress, obviously I smoke to calm myself down. 

Tried my first fag at 15, hated it, bought more, got used to it, got addicted pretty quickly.

Turn 18, spend most of my £20 a week wage washing dishes on rolling tobacco, complain I'm poor and can't afford booze. Duh.

Fast forward 3 years and I'm 21, prime age, ready to see the world, climb mountains, see the northern lights, maybe travel in space if space planes become a thing. Would rather like to live to see space.

Listen to the Allen Carr book just because I was interested, didn't really have that much desire to quit because I'm perfectly healthy physically and I only smoked 10-15 a day. 

Finish the book, smoked the entire way listening to it, was actually very nice, only took a few hours to hear everything he had to say plus he says just keep smoking as you listen, more than fine by me.

Something clicked, somewhere around chapter 10.

I realised that what I was doing with this dried leaf rolled in cellulose with a menthol tube was effectively taking £5 from my wallet, giving it to some rich dude and then letting him inject poison (not metaphorically, literal poison, look up nicotine) into my body.

Nicotine combined with the misconception of what cigarettes are used for make it incredibly hard to think of a quitting strategy.

You are not giving up, you are putting the key in the lock and opening the cage. Just need to find the key that fits, Allen Carr was the key for me.

TL:DR, Allen Carr is thrown around a lot on this sub, buy the fucking book right now, torrent it if you **must**, it is life changing. Also widespread commercial space planes soon pls.

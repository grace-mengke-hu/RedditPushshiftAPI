Neighbour is smoking right under my window

I stopped smoking a year ago after 5 years.   Was hard and I managed it  well, I think.

It's becoming harder with my new neighbor smoking right under my windows. 
Both my workplace and room have their windows directed to his house. 
Changing rooms isn't a possibility because I live with my brother, who is an asshole. 

I  dont feel like asking my neighbor not to smoke without feeling like I am bothering him. Asking him to smoke somewhere else also doesn't seem like a possibility since he likes to smoke in his pool.
It's his property, I can't simply ask him not to do what he wants. 
 I've been craving a cig since he moved in. To avoid that, I've been using the university's library to study,  but I don't have nowhere else to work. 

My family is wealthy and I could ask my parents to install a air conditioner but I don't really want to bother them since they are already paying for my studies and lending their house. 

Any tips on how to proceed?

Quitting today.

I've been a smoker since the beginning of my undergraduate degree, and now that I'm ending my first year of my graduate studies, I've realized that it is time to quit. I know it is damaging my health, I've started to develop receding gums from it, and my family has a history of lung cancer from smoking. I've tried quitting multiple times, sometimes only lasting a few hours. I've identified a few triggers for wanting to smoke, and one of them is interaction with a specific person in my degree program.. so I'm hoping going into summer break and being away from them I will be successful this time.

Wish me luck r/stopsmoking!

Day three with NRT - ideas about symptoms?

I am finding it difficult to find symptoms related to quitting smoking, as I am using NRT (the patch) which is a lower dose than the amount I was smoking.

I am experiencing tingling in one of my hands, and some nausea. Could this be related to quitting smoking, even though I am still getting nicotine? I have a doctor's appointment this upcoming Monday, but I thought I would check out these symptoms because given my recent health problems, I am VERY aware of body changes, and quite anxious...

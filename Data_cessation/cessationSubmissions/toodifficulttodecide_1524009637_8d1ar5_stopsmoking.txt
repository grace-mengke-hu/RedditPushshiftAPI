Coping with an irritable husband

Any tips or tricks? This is the umpteenth time he's tried cold turkey and becomes an absolute asshole. Double shitty that I smoke socially so I'm baffled at the intense mood swings. I can't live somewhere else for a week or be a verbal punching bag. Telling him to back off ends in fights and cigarettes. He honestly doesn't think he's being rude or nasty, like normal people respond WHAT?!! when asked how they are. I'm ready to just get him a pack so he calms the hell down.

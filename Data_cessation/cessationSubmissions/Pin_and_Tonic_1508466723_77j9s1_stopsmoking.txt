Quit smoking on vacation, home now and environmental triggers are TOUGH

I think I’m just looking for some reassurance, my fiancé is turning my irritability back on me and I’m feeling really unsupported.

I quit last week. I turned 30 and had many conversations with my fiancé about how much he hated that I smoked, so 29 year old me decided that I wanted to be smoke free in my 30s. I smoked an average of 4 cigarettes a day. I went to visit family and go to a wedding last week, and something about the travel made quitting moderately easy! 

One week later, I’m back at home and returning to my routine and I’m SO irritable, resentful and craving smoking. I know it’s my conditioned brain telling me that it’s time to smoke, but the reasonable side of me is trying to chime in that  “one a day isn’t that bad” and “you don’t even have a good reason to quit”.

My fiancé is really taking this personally, he’s sulking in the other room because I said that I didn’t want to be around him right now. My brain is totally blaming him for this discomfort.

Anyways, I need some words of wisdom, support, etc. thank you!!!

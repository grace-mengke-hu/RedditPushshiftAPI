Day 4, feeling better

I am on my 4th day of not smoking and I can already feel a difference. I don't have such a short fuse anymore. I'm coughing a lot still, but its much more manageable. I feel like my lungs are finally getting cleaned out. Speaking of my lungs, I still find some tightness in my chest during any kind of aerobic exercise, but I'm sure that will go away.

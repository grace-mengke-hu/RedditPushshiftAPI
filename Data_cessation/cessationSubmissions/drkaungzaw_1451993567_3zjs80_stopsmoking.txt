I am the one who controls myself

Hi friends,
I am new here in this sub. I am on my 3rd day of smoke free challenge. As you know, today I feel really crazy to get back into it. Although nicotine gum helps me to some extent, over the last 2 hours I was really crazy to smoke again. I stayed not to and use the smoke free app and I found this sub. I saw many posts here and it actually helped me a lot.

Now, I feel better and can sense that I can always overcome such trouble.

I would like to share with you one of my self motivation words to stop smoking, that is "I am the one who controls myself, I am able to achieve what I want and I don't need to depend on anything"

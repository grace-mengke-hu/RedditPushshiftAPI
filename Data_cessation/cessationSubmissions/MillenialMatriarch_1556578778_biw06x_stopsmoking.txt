3 months and it's like I never smoked

Today marks 90 days. 3 months. 1/4 of a year... with out a single dose of nicotine. This is my record since starting 20 years ago.


I'm 33, so more than half of my life was spent as a smoker. It's amazing to me that now just this short bit of time quit, I hardly think about smoking at all. I sit outside with my coffee every morning just like before, only now theres no smoke, no stink, no craving, no "just one more" before going to shower and play the non smoker part in public while counting down the hours until my next cigarette.

A few perks so far:

I'm not as easily annoyed. (Also quit biting finger nails a week in, without consciously trying at first).

I can wear things two or three times before washing.

My hair looks healthier because it doesnt have to be washed daily.

Adult acne has disappeared.

Teeth are whiter than ever.

I dont have to interrupt family time to have a fix.


My work days go by so much more quickly without the nagging withdrawal symptoms.

Spring smells like it did when I was a kid.



I hope all you new quitters and lurkers understand that feeling free can happen fairly quickly. The time passes one way or another. 


Keep up the good fight!!

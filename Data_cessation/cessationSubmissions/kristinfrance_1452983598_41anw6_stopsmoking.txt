Pregnant and quitting ðŸ˜žthe struggle is real!!

So, being pregnant has its own effects on my body, so does quitting alone. But I have had enough of feeling guilty and smelling like I have slept with an ashtray. I never quit with my first 2 pregnancies so I owe this one to my family. Is there anyone  that has done this, tried or is attempting this. I don't think pregnant woman want to talk openly because of the shame but I just want to know what I should expect. I don't care about judgement any more that would just hold me back. I'm totally turned off by cigarettes, I have a passionate hate for it. I'm excited about everything now but I want to talk more with women that are doing the same.

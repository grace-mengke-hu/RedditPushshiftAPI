Why I think 'failing' a quit attempt is not really a failure at all

I am a chronic quitter. What I mean by that is I try to quit around 5 times per year. The longest quit was just over a month, the shortest being around a week. Now, I tend to get a lot of stick about this from both my smoking and non-smoking friends, such as "Why bother?" and "It obviously never works.."

While I agree wholeheartedly that yes, there is a fundamental flaw in my quitting technique/willpower, I don't think it's a waste of time at all. I have made it through the hellish 3 days many, many times - yet I always return to smoking (so far). But this doesn't completely discourage me, for I know that as surely as I will return to smoking, I will try to quit again. One day I will eventually crack it, and I'm going to keep on trying until that day comes.

I wanted to share this because I used to be embarrassed of my 'failures'. But now I think of each quit as a conscientious step towards my long-term goal. I am not usually perseverant - but in this I will not be dissuaded. I want to encourage my fellow serial-quitters that the important thing is that we keep on trying!

Good luck to who have successfully quit, who are quitting now, and even those who are merely considering it. It's a step in the right direction and I, for one, am proud.

My experience with vaping to come down to zero nicotine.

My story: 2 Pack a day smoker for 12 years. Quit around 3.5 months ago, first 1 week was cold turkey. Picked up a vape with 0mg nicotine to help with the cravings. After another week, slowly added nicotine to my flavor, did 1.5mg, never more than that. Once by mistake took a drag off of a friends 6mg and got a headache for 30mins. 

20 days ago I cut off nic altogether and am super happy.

How I weaned of nic: Had 1 bottle of 30ml 3mg nic content and lot of 0mg juices. I cut that 3mg to 2 bottles of 1.5mg. I now had 60ml. I vaped a bottle. Then I was left with 1 bottle of 1.5mg. I cut this flavor again in two, again left with 2 bottles of .7mg. Vaped a bottle and again repeated the process. Now I had .35mg. Repeated again to .15mg. You get the picture. Finally just vaped 0mg. 

This process took a month and I threw away my bottles of nic content (exchanged a few bottles with friends), when I figured this would be an expensive hobby plus as inconvenient as smoking. The key thing is to have only 1 bottle of nic content, was too tempted to call up my friends in the middle of the night for nic flavor, if you've it around, you would vape that.

And guys who are hesitant to make the switch, do it, because for me, it was nothing. I had no cravings nor any side effects. Was getting some cigarette cravings initially but they were ignorable. First 10 days, my hunger increased but then naturally subsided. I had no headaches, no angst, nothing, barely anything changed. 

It's been 20 days and I don't even think about nic anymore. Get cravings for smokes once in a while but it's more or less ignorable. 

Now, I barely vape. The other day I went to a coffee shop where my friends hang out without my vape, they were chain smoking and I was sitting there without any problems. 

Good luck.

Hello StopSmoking, just had a nasty stomach virus and haven't smoked for 4 days!

I might not have quit on my own without this stomach virus but I'll take what I can get. It's still pretty rough and I definitely have to fight it with not being able to eat too much with my treatment. But I just wanted to say this seems like a great place and I look forwarded to coming here when I'm unbelievably angry at everything. =]

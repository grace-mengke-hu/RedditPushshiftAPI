Up since 6 am, cravings/ thoughts not letting up.

Just like the title says.  Doesn't help that I'm researching palliative care for our cat :(  Weepy from that.  Any help/ suggestions appreciated.  Today is technically my first day.  I ran out of cigarettes at 10:30 yesterday morning.  Made it through the whole day but then smoked one before bed in a moment of weakness.

EDIT:  Thanks for all of your suggestions, guys.  Just to clarify, I'm not having trouble sleeping.  I was just bitching about the sheer number of hours I'd been obsessing.  I did not smoke from 6 am until 8:15 pm yesterday, then I had one cigarette.  I know I set myself back if I feed it at all but I'm still pretty pleased.  If you knew me, you wouldn't guess I could make it through a day with only ONE smoke.  I'm up early again (5:40 am as I type this) and tennis doesn't start till 10am.  I think this morning I'll try to be more physical/ do less computer while I wait and see if that makes things easier.

Does anyone else really hate thinking of themselves as an addict?

Because I do. Whenever that word (addict) pops into my head, I think, "No I'm not." But I am, and I need to remember that, because remembering that I am addicted to a substance helps me fight off the craving and helps me remember exactly what door I'm opening if I give in.

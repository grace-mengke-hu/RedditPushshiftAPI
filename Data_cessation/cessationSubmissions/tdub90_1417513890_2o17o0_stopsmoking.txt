Early withdrawal and drinking water

So I'd like to share how drinking a lot of water helped me threw the first week or so of withdrawal. It become what I would reach for whenever I got the craving as I figured it would be a healthy substitute. Although it in itself didn't aid the suppression of withdrawal I honestly found the feeling of urinating such a nice relief sensation! Something which gives you that relaxed feeling after being in that tense mode of trying to ignore or cope through the cravings.  

I am male so not sure if this is the same for females. 
The elation of finally letting go after busting for a period of time was a great way... Just my experience.

Withdrawal symptoms returning after relapsing with 1-2 cigarettes?

I smoked "poppers" (weed + tobacco) for a couple years and stopped cold turkey on Aug 31. Had withdrawals for a few weeks and felt great, but started indulging in the occasional cigarette (2-3 per week) since November. 

Would withdrawal symptoms return even after having 1-2 smokes? 

Been quite tired the last few weeks and trying to figure out the underlying cause.

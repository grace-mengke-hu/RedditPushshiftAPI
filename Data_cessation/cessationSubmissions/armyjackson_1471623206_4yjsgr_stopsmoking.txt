Been hooked to patch, some smoking, starting Chantix "quit date" Monday

So I'm a bit of a tougher case than most says my doctors.  I am known for being nice to other people, however I turn into a monster when I don't have nicotine in my system.  I've been hooked to the 21mg nicotine patches for about 4 years now, only smoking when I try to go down to the 14s, or when my 21s aren't that effective (Sweating etc..) So my routine is pretty much non existent like it was 4 years ago. (2 packs a day for the past 20 years) 
Wish me luck.

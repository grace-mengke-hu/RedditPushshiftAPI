I want to quit smoking... But I'm stubborn

Here's the deal. I really want to quit smoking. (again) But this time I have the added pressure of the new rules my work is enforcing. No smoking on the property not even in your own personal car in the lot. And you cant leave the premises except on lunch break. I work 9-10 hr days and smoke 20-25 cigs a day. So obviously this wont work for me. I refuse to quit my great job that I love just because of this but I hate that they are basically forcing it on me! I do want to quit for my health for my daughter and for my wallet. Can anyone help me get over the resentment that is building toward my employer over this and help me realize that I just want to quit?

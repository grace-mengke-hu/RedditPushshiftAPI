One Week, reporting in

I won´t lie to you. For some reason i feel that it is getting harder and harder every day. I am very tired and the painfull cravings come and go. I haven´t been out yet or with smoking friends, thats gonna be another milestone to handle.  

Last night i used some nicotine chewing gum and it made me feel very sick. I am typing this mostly to distract myself from the cravings right now. I sleep a lot. I have the feeling i eat more then twice as much as i used to but gosh, why is it getting harder and not easier.

This forum helps me a lot. Thanks. Without you guys and your stories i wouldn´t had made it a week. Love and respect! 

PS: I think i am going out for a walk to the woods... get me some fresh air and inhale.

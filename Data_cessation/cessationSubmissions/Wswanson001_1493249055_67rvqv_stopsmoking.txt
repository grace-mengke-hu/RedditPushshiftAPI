Quit day: May 1st. Attempt number 9

So, going at it again. Been smoking since August of '97. Now I get winded by a 3 year old. It's time to kill this habit, salt and burn the bones. I downloaded a stop smoking app that pointed me to ya'll. Never looked for the support system, obviously not having one doesn't work. So, hi all!

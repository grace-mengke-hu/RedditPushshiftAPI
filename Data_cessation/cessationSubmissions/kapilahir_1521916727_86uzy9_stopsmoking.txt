Now I can roam worth same smoker friends feel bit but I can easily control my self now...
Please do not try this thing with yours keep your willpower more Strong 

Guys seriously many readers here who came here read and not quitting try to quit first anyhow pass first 3 days after that you can control your self but first 3 days is hard then its much easy... And yes quitting is possible no matter how much you smoke 
There is nothing in smoking we are doing much bad with our lungs just do bit youtube our lungs there for neat and clean air and we are giving nicotine and tar...

Well will write more on next milestone 

Thank you all love you all
Be healthy....
Thanks for reading
RIP my English and mistakes

It actually gets easier... I didn't think it would! (40 days!)

I just logged into this sub for the first time in 4 or 5 days, and holy shit, I'm at 40 days!  There were actually a couple days that I forgot to check my progress!  I also have the quit now app on my phone, and the last time I checked it was 3 days ago or so!  

I still have pretty bad cravings when drinking and after a big meal, but I've gotten through them.  It's amazing the day to day cravings are almost gone.  

Stick with it guys, I smoked for about 14 years, and part of my brain is still pretending I liked it.  My worst days were 3-5, and then 9-12 or so.  I can't believe it's been over a month!  Booya!

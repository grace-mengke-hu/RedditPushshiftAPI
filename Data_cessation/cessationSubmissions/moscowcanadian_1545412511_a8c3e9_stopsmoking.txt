Read Allen Carr’s book again with an open mind

I had read Allen Carrs EASYWAY to quit smoking twice before , both as a younger person and as a more close minded person. I also had ripped a PDF of the book and was reading it on my kindle, and since it was a pirates PDF I couldn’t increase the tiny font and the book was full of typos AND was the original (I believe 1992) version. While as Allen Carr says in the newer American version I recently bought and read that the message after twenty years of feedback is essentially unchanged, it was nice to have A. A properly purchased copy (as I feel twelve dollars to Mr. Carr’s great book is well worth the life changing effect it had) and B. Being from Canada, the American version had a few more references that were more accessible to me.

I had my last cigarette today and I am THRILLED to be a non smoker. I have so much to gain and nothing to lose!! I am free of the trap! :) just wanted to celebrate with y’all .

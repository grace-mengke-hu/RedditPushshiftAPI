Time to stop.

I'll be blunt. I've smoked for a long time. I'm 23 years old, and have been doing it since before puberty. 

I hate it. Just this minute, I have decided no more. It will be hard. Very hard. However, I have decided that I shall no longer smell of stagnant smoke or have horrible teeth due to it. 

Today is the first day in a long time that I have decided something as solid as this.

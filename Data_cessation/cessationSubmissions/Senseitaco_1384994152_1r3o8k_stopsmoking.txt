Never really tried this before...

Here goes, I guess.

I've always been really easily able to just kind of... Not smoke if I wanted to "quit," until the last year or two, maybe. Crazily enough, I've grown addicted to this insanely addictive substance.

I've kind of halfheartedly tried to quit over the last couple months, but it hasn't worked. Every time I buy a new pack to try and wean myself down a little, it just hasn't gone that way. I've smoked one or five too many a day almost immediately. So today on my way home from work I just didn't pick up another pack, and I smoked my last one about three hours ago.

It's gonna be really weird not smoking a cigarette on my way to work tomorrow, another two on my breaks, another one on the way home, and another one or three later in the day, and it's gonna be weird on Friday, and it'll probably be weird for a few days after that too, but I really want to be able to run more than fifteen feet. Also, emphysema sounds unpleasant.

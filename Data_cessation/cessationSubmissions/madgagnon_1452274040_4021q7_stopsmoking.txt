Crippling constipation

I realize this might be TMI, but my main excuse for smoking relapses has always been that they, er, keep things moving along. And without that, I've now endured 6 days of pretty severe constipation. Mind you, I'm pretty healthy - i drink a gallon of H2O/day, exercise (Crossfit), eat oatmeal with Chia seeds for breakfast, kale shakes for a snack...but no matter what I try (and believe me, I've tried pretty much everything), the constipation endures. Anyone else have this problem? It was really, really hard last night to not run out for a pack to try and alleviate the discomfort.

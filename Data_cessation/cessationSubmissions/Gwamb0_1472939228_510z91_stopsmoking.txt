Day 1: fail 1

So it's almost 1 day.. Didn't have much problems at the beginning, but got quite worse later on. And I failed. I smoked like half. Taste didnt feel good, and I got dizzy so I threw it away. Feels like poking with needle "do it, to it, do it". Annoying as fk. Figured out if I drink some water it helps.. Also if I redirect my thinking it helps even more. Solving chess problems seems to work very well since I have to be focused. Working night shift and no way I could even get a cigarette. And bored.. Usually I was smoking most while working nights.. Not today tho ^^ hopefully tomorrow I wont crack and smoke..

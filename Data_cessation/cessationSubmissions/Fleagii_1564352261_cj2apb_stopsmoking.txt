Day 5 - Smoke Free, What Hell

It has been five (5) days of being smoke free. What complete hell it has been. I am not sleeping worth shit and I feel so wore out. My throat was hurting and now is not so much, my chest hurts, GERD flaring up like no tomorrow. When will this be over?   


I do know when you quit smoking some or all of these are what can happened to some of us due to withdraws. The first day or two I was on the patch, but I decided to go cold turkey. This whole process is a complete nightmare that needs to end now. And let's not forget about the eating part. If my shirt taste like anything, I am sure I would eat that too.

My thought after one year.  

So it’s been a little over a year since I put down my faithful friend Mr. Marlboro Light Menthol.  You can see from my past post it was not easy for me in the beginning.  I had lots of rough days.  But I’m pleased to say those are behind me.  Here are a few things I learned about me.  If they can help you quit, awesomesauce.  

-It really is all in your mind.  Sure you’re going to be told you need “replacement” products, but you don’t.  I smoked a pack and half a day for 17 years.  That’s as much a smoker as any of you I’d wager, and I woke up one morning and decided enough was enough.  They key part in all this is I made up my mind.  I still have my pack from one year ago in my shop, on a shelf where I can look at them.  I think there are 19 left.  Prolly taste like shit now…

-I live in KY-USA, where smokes are cheaper than just about anywhere else (bout $4.00 a pack when I quit/and $1.75 when I started), and I’ve saved close to $2,300.00 this year.  How bout that shit?  I spent every last dime on shit I wanted.  Understand, not things I needed, things I wanted.  And I did it all early in the year.  This was my way of spending all my cig money on something else.  Even if I wanted to buy smokes, the money was ready spent.  And now I have a new kick ass TV and tools.  Not cotton butts and ashes. 

-Once I did quit, I didn’t chance anything about my life, and that’s why I had such a hard time in the beginning.  Now, I’m eating better, and working out.  I feel 100000% better, and you really don’t want to smoke when you’re in that lifestyle. 

Overall I’m in a better place now, it’s all progress, ya know?  Take it a day at a time; just know that once you make your mind up, you’ve already won.  The only thing left is to go through the motions.

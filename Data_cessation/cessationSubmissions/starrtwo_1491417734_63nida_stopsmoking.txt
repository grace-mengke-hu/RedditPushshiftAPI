Day 5, using an ecig

Hey all, first time poster.

Had my last cigarette almost exactly 5 days ago. I've been using an ecig as lightly as possible, and I'm trying to break nicotine dependency by cutting down nicotine use through the ecig. Has anyone else used this method? Does anyone strongly discourage using the ecig? Additionally, I've been having bad headaches and a cough the last two days. Is it normal to be feeling ill even though i'm still getting nicotine? Perhaps it's because I'm getting much less nicotine than before?

Thanks everyone!

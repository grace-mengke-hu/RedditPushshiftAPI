Holy fuck. Had a nicotine-withdrawal headache since I quit. 4 days ago. Help??

Hey guys, just found this thread & I need some guidance. I just recently moved back home and hate to have my mom see me smoking (as her dad passed of emphysema), therefore I took it upon myself, after 2 years of smoking to quit. The first year it took me about a week or two to finish a pack....then it gradually built its way up to 3-4 days/pack. Now I'm sitting here nauseous, cranky and holding the sides of my head to relieve the pain. Don't get me wrong, I'd much rather this bullshit than to have a tube shoved in my trachea at age 21, so I really am just asking what helped you all in your anti-smoking endeavors. **Note:** I really do not want to waste money or resort to nicotine patches/e-cigarettes/nicotine alternatives. I am really trying to do this cold turkey. Sincerely, cranky and need help!

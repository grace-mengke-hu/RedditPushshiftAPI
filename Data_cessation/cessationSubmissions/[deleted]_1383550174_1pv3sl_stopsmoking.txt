I got 99 Problems but smoking ain´t one. The last week was a rollercoaster, but I made it.

The last week was really tough. I was so stressed and for some stupid reason I started to think about smoking the whole time. My brain tried to trick me into buying "one" pack. lol.

And on top of that, on friday a good friend of mine had birthday and wanted to celebrate in a club. I just thought: great -.- .  But...I not only managed to resist the craving, I also went out drinking on top of that, got offered a cig at least 5 times and didn´t smoke. Hell yeah and now I feel really awesome. My confidence is back.

To everybody who finds himself in a really tough situation and is close to buy a pack, I can give one advice: Just don´t do it and wait it out. It is like battling against all instincts. Exept that it´s an ocean of illusionary instincts.

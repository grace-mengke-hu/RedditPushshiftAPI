Seneca said,“You are younger; but what does that matter? There is no fixed count of our years. You do not know where death awaits you; so be ready for it everywhere.”

Millennia before the now-tired adage that “time is money,” Seneca cautions that we fail to treat time as a valuable resource, even though it is arguably our most precious and least renewable one:

**People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.**

To those who so squander their time, he offers an unambiguous admonition:

“You are living as if destined to live forever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don’t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply — though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire… **How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end!** How stupid to forget our mortality, and put off sensible plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth years, aiming to begin life from a point at which few have arrived!”

"You only get one body and one life on this earth. Respect yourself and love yourself enough to take the best care of yourself.”

*This simply means good health* = more time. ***Never*** **Forget This**. 

Making just a few changes in your lifestyle can help you live longer.

> A recent study found that four bad behaviours—smoking, drinking too much alcohol, not exercising, and not eating enough fruits and veggies—can hustle you into an early grave, and, in effect, age you by as many as 12 years.

* Too much time in front of the boob tube can take a serious toll on your health. In fact, a 2010 study found that **people who watched four or more hours a day were 46% more likely to die from any cause than people who watched less than two hours a day.** Think about that for a second. 

Even cutting back a little can help; each additional hour you watch increases your overall risk of dying by 11% and dying from heart disease by 18%.

* Research shows that you’re at greater risk of heart disease without a strong network of friends and family. Loneliness can cause inflammation, and in otherwise healthy people it can be just as dangerous as having high cholesterol or even smoking.

**Loneliness seems to pose the greatest risk for elderly people, who are also prone to depression.**

* Women who have two or more drinks a day and men who have three or more may run into detrimental effects ranging from weight gain to relationship problems. But in smaller quantities, alcohol can actually be good for you.

A 2010 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology linked light drinking (defined as one drink a day for women and two for men) to **significant heart benefits.**

* Getting fewer than three servings of fruits and vegetables a day can eat away at your health. Nutritional powerhouses filled with fiber and vitamins, fruits and veggies can lower your risk of heart disease by 76% and may even play a role in decreasing your risk of breast cancer.

As an added bonus, the inflammation-fighting and circulation-boosting powers of the antioxidants in fruits and veggies can banish wrinkles.

* Exercise, duh. 

A simple trip to the convenience store to grab a late night coffee gave me some inspiration to speak to you guys about health being a commodity we have control over, despite this control there are instances where this can be taken away from us.

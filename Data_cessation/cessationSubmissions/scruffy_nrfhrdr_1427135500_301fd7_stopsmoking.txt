Day 1 of Quitting smoking while using a Vape/E-cig

I'm a recovering alcoholic addict with 2 years and change clean and sober. I've been smoking a pack a day since I was 16 and I am now 27. I Haven't gone a day without a Cigarette since 16 years old, I'm trying to just make it through today. I keep going through phases of bouncing between confidence/strength/pride & depression/missing smoking/feeling like I can't do this.

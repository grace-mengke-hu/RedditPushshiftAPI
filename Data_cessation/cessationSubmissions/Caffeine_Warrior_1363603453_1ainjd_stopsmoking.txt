Got ill a few days ago (Bronchitis or something likewise). Haven't smoked since then. Feeling much worse now?

My illness looked very mild at first, I kept going to class, etc... I didn't want to smoke while I was sick so I decided to quit altogether. Now since I haven't smoked for a few days I feel much worse and hit by a severe case of sinusitis, my bronchitis became much worse. Also I'm tired all day and haven't been to class since. 

I feel that stopping smoking actually made me more ill. I have been smoking for 2-3 years. Is this common?

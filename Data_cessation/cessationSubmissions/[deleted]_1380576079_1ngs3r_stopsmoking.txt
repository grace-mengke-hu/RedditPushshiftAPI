Got a common cold

I got the sickness last week and it came with great timing as my brain was trying to trick me into buying a pack taking 1 cig out and tossing the pack as a celebration for my making it so long.  I became sick and 6 days later I just now thought about them again and how smoking when I had a cold always made it so much worse.  Keep on trucking.

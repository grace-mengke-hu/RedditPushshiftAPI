33 days.... suddenly want to smoke again.

I've been smoke free for 33 days now which is great.  This afternoon, however, I have really been thinking about smoking.  I'm just stopping by for a few words from other quitters to re-affirm that I don't want to smoke and these thoughts will pass.  Cheers.

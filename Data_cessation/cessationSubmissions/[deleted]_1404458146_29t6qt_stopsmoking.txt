My first reset! There really is only one thing to remember

If you quit smoking, do NOT have anything to smoke ever again. Never think you have beaten it, never think that only having one cigarette will be worth it.

After about 5 months, i decided to smoke a cigar. this led to a few cigarettes on drinking nights, this led to the first pack being bought last week and that led to this post.

Damn you cigarettes, I want a rematch

Made it to Day 5!

Hi everyone! This is my third serious attempt at quitting, so I knew what to expect heading into this, and days 3 and 4 have been rough during previous attempts. So proud of myself for making it through the weekend! It was a bit nerve-wracking since I work in a VERY smoky bar, but just drank lots of water, got plenty of fresh air and was fine!

On prior quits I have been able to remain smoke-free for up to 9 months, hope to make it longer this go around! It's been really helpful and inspiring to hear about everyone's success, so thanks! Keep posting and best of luck to you all!

Heading down a dangerous path

At a show this past weekend I go out with the rest of the band to get some air while they...ahem..."get some air." I've been avoiding them at set break but I feel so much stronger now I can handle it. 


A singer I knew from a different band strides up to me and lights one up. "I thought you quit," I inquire. "I did," came her response, "This is an **herbal** smoke mon," (we both play in reggae bands).


Interested in trying one, but still wary from my last smoke sharing experience, I ask if I can roll one of my own. She obliges and I partake. To my surprise, it was not an unpleasant experience! My acquaintance explains to me that she uses this as filler for the spliffs she enjoys from time to time. "An excellent idea," I exclaim. 


After three of these over the course of the past four days, I do not feel any urges to buy a pack of cigarettes, and I do not feel as if my resolve has faltered. I *do,* however, realize the danger of going through these motions. I simply ask for your good wishes as I evaluate the merits of using this herbal smoke as an extender of my rolling stash.

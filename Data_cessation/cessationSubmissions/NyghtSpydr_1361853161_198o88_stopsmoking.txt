My first major test

I've been smoke free for somewhere around 23 days now (on phone I don't see my badge), and I got a lot on my mind tonight with my job and I'm at a local pub for a drink with a friend who smokes. This was very difficult, but I passed! I didn't smoke!! I'm so proud of myself right now!

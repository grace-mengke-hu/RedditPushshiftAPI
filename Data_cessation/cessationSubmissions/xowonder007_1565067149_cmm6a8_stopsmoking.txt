Does anyone have any recommendations for stop smoking MJ?

Don’t get me wrong I enjoy the the green fun that comes with it but it starts to become a hassle. Traveling, masking the smell, finding a safe place to smoke, it just starts to become a nuisance. I don’t smoke cigarettes and I occasionally have a drink or two on the weekend. 

I’ve recently stopped for 24 hours because I had to head of town. I still have my goodies with but with how my day went I wasn’t able to smoke. In that 24 hours, eating sucked greatly. Breakfast I ate like a rabbit and got light nausea and hot sweats. Dinner was the same way. I did have a drink mid day to do something but I’m not start drinking to fill a void. 

I found myself wanting to continue the streak but with eating and sleeping, I told myself just one bowl. I kept it to one bowl.  But now I’m writing on reddit, trying to my wrap my head around how I can stop for 3 days, a week, a month, you get my drift.

Im open to all suggestions and anyone that has been through it as well. I’ve never really had a reason to stop but I want to rewire my brain. Thank you all for listening to my rant. Mucho love.

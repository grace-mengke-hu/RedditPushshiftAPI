At what point do you change from "I'm quitting smoking" to "I've quit smoking"

When I've been in uni the past few days I've bumped into some former smoking buddies who invite me out for a smoke. I just tell them "I'm quitting".

When is it time to say "I've quit". I get the feeling I could do already as it's been almost two weeks and cravings go away in less than a minute once I remember my reasons.

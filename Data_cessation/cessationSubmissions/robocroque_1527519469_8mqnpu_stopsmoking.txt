Almost 48 hours, and I want to punch something

Hi everyone,

I've been a smoker for eight years, going almost a pack per day over the past 2-3 years. Saturday I quit smoking, and while I knew the first day of work would be hard, I didn't think it would be this hard. I'm really irritable and annoyed by even the smallest things, and I'm starting to not like who I am today. Do any of you have some hints to help me enhance my calm?

I'm using the Smoke Free app, but none of the hints there have helped today :/

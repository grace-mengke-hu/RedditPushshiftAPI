Day 6... talk me down please

Backstory: Age 31, smoked cigs since I was 15.  Pack per day, and slightly more if drinking.  

I am currently on day 6 with a little help from an E-cig when the cravings get too intense.  I plan on eliminating the e-cig within a month as I will reduce the nicotine potency with each purchase.  

It has been more mentally tough than anything and I find my mind wandering into fits of rage and depression.  I feel at this point in my life I have my emotions in check and can keep the shit internal for now.  Today has been rough so far.  Need some encouragement.  

Motivation: Had an accepted offer on a home and need to improve my finances to live comfortably.  Realizing that finding a top tier mate can be tough while being a smoker.  Sick of smelling like shit and feeling congested.  

Congrats to everyone here on making decisions to better their life.  Can someone just tell me it will be okay sooner than later?

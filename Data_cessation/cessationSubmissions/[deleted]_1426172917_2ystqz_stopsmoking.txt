Screwing myself with taking a drag or two

Day 39, this is the longest I've gone in a while. This week I've taken a couple of drags off of friend's cigarettes. Now today I am near the edge. I feel like I need to smoke and I hate it, because I know I don't. Just goes to show to not fooling around with ANY nicotine is the way to go.

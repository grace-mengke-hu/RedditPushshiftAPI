Just want to share an incredible experience I just had!


It's now three weeks since I quit smoking, and I can already feel my senses, breath and energy levels improving. However, I just experienced something amazing and I just want to share it with you:

I am from Denmark, but currently traveling in Asia, and just arrived to a small beach town in the western part of the Philippines. It's now 5am and about an hour ago I woke up unable to fall asleep again. I decided to go for a walk, and made my way to the ocean. 
When I reached the sand, the strong wind hit my face, and what happened was this; I SMELLED the ocean. It was so amazing, cause I grew up by the beach and used to go for walks with my mom every single day when I was little, so this smell just instantly took me back to my childhood. I haven't been able to smell this for 15 years, and it really teared up my eyes. I had forgot about this. It's incredible how smells can hold memories like that.
At first I just enjoyed it, but now it hit me - it's probably because I quit smoking!! I can't believe it. I really hope for everyone who has quit to experience a similar thing :-) 

Thank you for inspiring and helping me to the best decision I've ever taken!

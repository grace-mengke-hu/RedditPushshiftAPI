Day 100!!

Feels so amazing. Was sprinting during my jog today. Feeling like it's actually possible to be an athlete again. I've been a lurker on Reddit all my life but wanted to thank this subreddit for not being lurkers while I lurked :)!!! To all the smokers who have quit or are wanting to quit, it does get easier! Life is so much better. I feel alive again!

Another one

Almost 5 years ago, I quit smoking the first time, lasted all of 6 months, and then after a particularly bad day, went right back into the embrace of that smokey mistress. I'm now away from home, in a new environment, and decided now was as good a time as any to try to quit again. So lets go, again. 

I've got the help of an e-cig, which so far in 2 days has helped me avoid cigarettes entirely, though I'm still using nicotine (3mg nicotine). My plan of action is to gradually wean myself off the nicotine over the next 2 months or so, and to not even vape after 3 months. wish me all the luck in the world friends. We can do this.

What Helped ME Quit -- Mood Swings - CHOOSE YOUR ATTITUDE

 (I just gave this advice to someone in the thread, and wish I'd had this at the start of quitting. 9 months clean)

&amp;#x200B;

*"These mood swings suck. I can't help but be mean."*

I let that exact same excuse stop me from quitting for six months.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the catch: If you can't be nice without having nicotine in your system; you're just an **asshole**. Plain and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that you're aware of the mood swings tells me, you sir or madam, are not an asshole. You have in you, the capacity to be kind, and gentle, and charitable with your words and the way you express yourself. Nicotine is just an easy excuse to take the easy route out, and expend less energy.

&amp;#x200B;

Take deep breaths. If someone is seriously pissing you off, just say "I'm really frustrated right now, and you know I recently quit smoking. I need to take a minute." Don't ask for a minute. Just take one. Go breathe. Go outside; the air's clearer. Big deep breathes. Stretch. Touch your toes. Rejoice in how freeing not smoking is, and enjoy not having a coughing fit as you go back inside. Talk it out like the rational adult you can be.

**--Choose your attitude--**

&amp;#x200B;

That's what took me six months to figure out. Now take the six months of your life I'm giving you and go be productive. 

**You've got this.**

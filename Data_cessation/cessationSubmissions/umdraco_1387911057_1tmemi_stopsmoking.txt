3 days not smoking w/ herbals

7 days ago I began my journey, but I began the wrong way, I left cigarette butts in my ash tray. for the next 3 days every time I had a craving I would reach for a butt, eventually I noticed that my cravings were no different than if I had smoked a regular 100. So I had been keeping myself addicted as opposed to being weened off. day 4 my addiction was just as strong and I went shopping, I bought a pack, I smoked 4 through the afternoon, until I got to a smoke shop and asked for nicotine  & tobacco free, cigarettes. The herbals smell like basil when raw and week when smoked, they taste terrible, and I still crave nicotine on this my 3rd day without any of it. The herbals give me the sensation of smoking without the satisfaction. But somehow it makes it easier, something to do when I crave. I think I might go all the way with this. I know herbal cigarettes are just as bad as regulars when use is prolonged, they have tar, carbon and carcinogens but they are non addictive, so eventually when my brain stops reaching for niccotine I will stop reaching for herbals.

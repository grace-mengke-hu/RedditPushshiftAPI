How to continue not to smoke when facing excessive stress

Hello all,

I have not smoked in two weeks and it has been going well. I have been using the patch.

Last night, while drunk, I was unfaithful to my girlfriend. I am head over heels in love with my girlfriend, so my intoxicated decision to betray her trust has been very hard for me to process.  I told her what I did this morning, and we both cried.  I am stressed as all hell right now.

I was wondering: to those who have stopped for long periods of time, how do you fight the urges when you are highly stressed?  Thanks.

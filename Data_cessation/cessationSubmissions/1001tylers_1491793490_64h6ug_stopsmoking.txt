Why can't I quit?

I keep trying to quit. I've tried to stop at least 200 times. It just doesn't work. I keep not making it past the first 3 days. It's like I don't even believe that I can anymore. Even when I'm super determined and think I'm ready what seems like a few hours later I'm at the cornerstore buying new smokes and a lighter. I keep telling myself this is it and throwing out the smokes and the lighter. I'm at the point where I'm buying a lighter with every pack of smokes. What is this? So frustrating. I'd get better results from just bashing my head agaist the wall. At least then I'd be knocked out and not smoking. I can't figure out how to get through the first hump. It's weird because I've stopped before for a couple months here and there but lately I can't get past the first 2 days even. Why? It's like I'm posessed. I'm also the guy who's addicted enough that when I didn't have money I'd roll smokes from butts in the garbage. 

Anyone else been here and know a way through this?

Update:
I managed to get to 3 1/2 days quit. I hope I can keep this up.

You CAN do this! A message of encouragement from someone 2+ years nicotine-free.

Hello everyone!

I just wanted to pop in here today to tell everyone struggling with quitting smoking that you can most definitely do this.

Me: I was a 3/4 pack to a pack a day smoker for 10 years. In that 10 years I tried to quit literally countless times. I tried every method of quitting (with the exception of the prescriptions like Chantix, etc) with varying levels of success and failure each time, staying quit for anywhere from a few hours to a few months. What worked for me was going cold turkey, and telling myself "not one more puff, never, ever again". Today I'm not here to advocate for that method (though if you are interested, please feel free to ask me anything about my experience and I will be glad to share), I am here to simply tell you that you can do this, and to encourage you to not give up even if it seems hopeless, because later, not so long from now, you will be SO thankful that you did.

Not only can you do this, but there will come a time when you barely think about smoking anymore. I'm talking to those of you who have been quit for days-months. You probably still think about smoking multiple times a day. Each minute is a struggle and you're wondering if it will ever stop being so hard. It will. I am almost 3 years nicotine free and I can't even remember the last time I had a real craving. I still think about smoking now ever so occasionally, maybe when I smell someone smoking, but the nature of my thoughts has changed; I am disgusted by the smell and simultaneously thankful that I quit, instead of smelling it and craving one.

I have more money in my pocket, can breathe more easily, have more energy, can taste and smell things again, and am all around happier without nicotine.

You can do this. Just don't give up.

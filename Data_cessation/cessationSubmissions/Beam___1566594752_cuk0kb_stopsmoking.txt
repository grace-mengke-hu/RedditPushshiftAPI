Day 0

Tonight, my SO and I sat outside, gazing at the stars. When I wanted to light up my second to last cig, I realized this tiny ashtray was full again. 

I said to here: „please, can we get a bigger one for the balcony out the back?“

She replied: „well, it should make us realize: we smoke to much. Stop smoking, don’t buy a bigger ashtray...“

Day 0: half an hour into Allen Carrs book. Wish me luck. Tomorrow is the day.

Been lurking here for a while, I hope I’m as strong as you are.

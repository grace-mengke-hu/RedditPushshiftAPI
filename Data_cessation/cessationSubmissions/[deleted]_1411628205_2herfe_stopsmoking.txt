Quitting Smoking in College

I didn't smoke before attending college and I never intended to, but then I pledged a fraternity. Having to always have smokes on you and the stress of pledgeship creates an inviting opportunity to smoke, and boy did I seize the opportunity. I went from a vehement nonsmoker to a pack a day guy in about a week. Once I got initiated the smoking only got worse, tests and papers drive the need for nicotine at school (I attend a top ranked university in Texas). My moment of clarity came when I was playing basketball back home with some friends from high school and I found myself out of breath. This surprised me because barely a year ago was an all state football player in high school. I put it off as not working out as much as I used to but the thought was still there in the back of my mind, its because I smoke. Finally I accepted that it was because of my smoking and today I decided to quit and threw out my pack. I feel great 24 hours later and can't wait for how I will feel in the weeks and months to come!

tl;dr picked up smoking in school and now I'm quitting.

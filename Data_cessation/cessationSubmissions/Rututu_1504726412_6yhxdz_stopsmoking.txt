Almost fainted during exercise. This ends now.

So I've been planning to quit smoking for a while now. Been smoking for 15 years. I was already planning to quit tomorrow, but now I'm even more determined.

I was supposed to start a new hobby today - submission wrestling. Just had my first training session, and 45 minutes in I almost fainted. I tried to gather myself but after wheezing and shaking for 10 minutes I had to pack it up and call it a day. I could barely stand up.

Long story short, I came home and snapped a bunch of cigarettes in half. This is it. I'm done crippling myself like this. 

Bring on the withdrawals, I couldn't care less. Here's to a smoke-free life from now on. Wish me luck.

Today should have been 100 days but I fell off the wagon

Recently I went to a wedding and smoked a few cigarettes, couple of weeks later I bummed a few off some people at a conference and today I smoked 2. 

In 100 days I have smoked on 4 days. I know why I smoked. I was anxious, kind of bored, I thought it would somehow do something. But all I feel now is shame, so fuck that.

I am not letting 4 days destroy the other 96. I start again, right now.

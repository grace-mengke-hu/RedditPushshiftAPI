Here i am, one of you!

So today i made a deal with a redditor on /r/C25K. Today is the day i stop smoking. No cigarettes today, only 2 yesterday. So far i'm good. 

i might add a bit of a backstory. i'm 19 years old. had my first cigarette when i was nearly 15. started smoking when i was nearly 16. i stopped smoking for half a year or so, just because i wanted to see how long i would make it. then i was stupid enough to start again. why? well i don't know. but after starting to go for runs i'm finally ready to really break that habit and get rid of the cigarettes!

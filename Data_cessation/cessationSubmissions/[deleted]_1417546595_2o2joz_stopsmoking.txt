A friend of mine died of COPD 11/4.

What ends up killing is so slowly progressing the threat of death seems unreal. It was a painful reminder. She decided to end her own life basically. Chose to remove a hose from a punctured lung that just wouldn't heal. I reset my badge today I really hope I make it this time.

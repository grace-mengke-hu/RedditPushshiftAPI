It ends now!

Had an amazing 5 months when the year began where I did not smoke a single cigarette, unfortunately I relapsed a few months ago. Every attempt to quit since them has been a miserable failure. Have not been able to complete 24 hours of non-smoking since then. I am tired of this, and I am going to give it all this time. Just smoked my last last cigarette! Thanks for the support!

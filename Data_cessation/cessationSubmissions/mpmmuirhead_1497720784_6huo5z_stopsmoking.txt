5 months today! Checking in!

Hey all! I just wanted to thank you guys for all your assistance over the past 5 months. You guys are inspiring, and seeing your success stories in my news feed every day has been the most helpful thing in helping me quit smoking.

If I ever feel doubtful I can always just come here and see all the people here who have successfully quit smoking.

You guys have helped more than just me though and you don't even realize it. My success so far has directly inspired two of my friends to quit smoking now. One of them hasn't smoked in 2 weeks, and another in a month.

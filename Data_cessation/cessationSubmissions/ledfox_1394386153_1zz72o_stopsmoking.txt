Two weeks is a habit, right?

I quit two weeks ago yesterday and haven't felt better. I am really enjoying the taste of food and the lung capacity to ride my bike to work, and most of the problems I had right after I quit are gone (sleep issues, mostly). If anybody is reading this and just started: hang in there, it is definitely worth it.

I wanted to ask about the idea of a habit forming in two weeks. Does anybody believe this is true? It seems like it would vary depending on what you're trying to do. Also, does this apply to dropping a habit as well? 

Anyway, hang in there everybody.

I wasn't planning on quitting but I just found out I'm pregnant yesterday.

I got the surprise of my life last night with two positive pregnancy tests. I definitely want to quit now but I've been a heavy smoker for years and its been hard. I've only had 5 cigarettes today which is way less than I normally would have but I still feel so guilty about it. I want my baby to be healthy. My boyfriend got me peppermints to suck on when I have cravings but I've still given into the urge a few times. Please give me all your tips for quitting because I want to be completely done with them as soon as possible. Thank you everyone.

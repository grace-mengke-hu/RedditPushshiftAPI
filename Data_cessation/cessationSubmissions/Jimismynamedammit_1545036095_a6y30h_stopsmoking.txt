Moving into day 2.

Just had my blowout 50th birthday party Saturday night, so Sunday was my quit day.  Had my last (I hope) Marlboro at around 0500.  It's been smooth so far, but I think it's to get shitty.  Just wanted to put this out there, make it official and perhaps keep some accountability.  Thanks, y'all.

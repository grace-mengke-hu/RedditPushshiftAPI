Quit smoking 8 days ago and have annoying middle of forehead headache or tightness? What is this and how can I get rid of it?

Kind of in between eye brows pressure or tightness that just won’t go away. I know I’m still a new non smoker and my body is still getting rid of crap. Should I just be patient and ride this out even though it makes me feel kinda woozy now and then?

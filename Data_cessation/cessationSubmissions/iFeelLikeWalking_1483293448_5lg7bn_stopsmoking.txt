Day Zero - here we go

Been smoking 1 pack a day for 20 years. I don't even want to do the math to calculate how much money I spent. To be honest, I enjoyed it for a long time. But the time has come... I cough too often and I have this wonderful whistle in my breath sometimes. So yeah. No. More.

Had my coffee and had no craving for a smelling cigarette. To stop wanting to do something with my hand I do two things: 1) fap, and 2) eat sunflower seeds.

I did slap on a patch when the urge lasted for an hour.

Wish me well.

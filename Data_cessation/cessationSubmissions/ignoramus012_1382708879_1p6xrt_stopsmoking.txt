Thoughts on 365 Days

I originally wrote this post 265 days ago, on my 100 day quitiversary. A few people asked that I re-post and update this list at 200 days, so I did. I was going to do it again at 300 days, but I figured why not wait an extra 65 days and do it at one year? (I promise this will be the last time I post it)

I don't pretend to be some sort of expert on quitting, and I'm not saying what worked for me will work for everyone, but I feel like a year is a significant milestone and that other quitters might be able to learn from my experiences.

* **You have to really want it.** If you're quitting for someone else or just because you think you should, you will fail. You are stronger than nicotine, but you have to believe it. Encouragement is helpful, but if it's not ultimately coming from yourself it won't help.

* **The moment you quit smoking, you are a non-smoker.** There's no such state as "trying to quit." It doesn't matter if you've been a non-smoker for one year, one month, one week, one day, one hour, or one minute. We are all non-smokers.

* **Cold turkey is what worked for me.** I tried e-cigs, but they just made me want the real thing more. Again, what worked for me might not work for you, so this isn't a hard and fast rule, but smokers are nicotine addicts, plain and simple. The quicker you get the nicotine out of your system the quicker withdrawal will subside. All that being said, don't judge other people's methods. I've seen a lot of people on this sub look down on others for using NRT's or e-cigs. The most important thing is to get off tobacco. That is what is most dangerous. Encourage people to give cold turkey a try, but if it doesn't work for them, encourage them to use any means necessary.

* **Read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.** Yes, he sounds like a shill. Yes, he's a horrible writer. Yes, he's annoyingly repetitive. BUT IT WORKS! I didn't even have to get through half the book before I no longer wanted to smoke. It's not about learning some magical method, it's about changing your attitude towards smoking. It's about confronting and breaking down all those excuses and justifications that smokers use to continue their habit. Every single one of them is bullshit. Deep down we all know it, but we allow ourselves to fool ourselves. In these moments, it may seem like our rational brain talking, but that nicotine imp is pulling the strings.

* **Judge smokers harshly.** Not out loud. Don't be a jerk to them or anything, just inwardly tell yourself how weak they are compared to you. Bask in your own awesomeness every time you see someone light up, or you catch a whiff of smoke. They can't do without cigarettes and you can! Last time I posted this, there was some trepidation over this part. Quitting is a mind game. The point is to convince yourself that quitting is the right thing to do and that you have power over the drug not the other way around. When I do this I'm not actually judging people, I'm playing a little mental game for myself to bolster my confidence.

* **Exercise whenever you get a craving.** It doesn't have to be super strenuous or anything, just do jumping jacks or jog in place or dance or whatever you want. I use a stationary bike. Just do something active for 5-10 minutes. It'll distract you from the craving, release some endorphins to combat the withdrawal symptoms, and help to offset the weight many former smokers gain when they quit.

* **Drink lots of water.** Most people are walking around slightly dehydrated anyway, so this is just good general advice, but I also found that a big glass of cold water lessened withdrawal symptoms. It'll also help flush out the nicotine.

* **Make new associations with things you did while smoking.** For example, lots of people say don't drink for the first couple weeks to a month. This may be the best course of action for you, but for me, I just needed to drink where there weren't smokers. Invite some nonsmoking friends over and have a few drinks and you'll begin to disassociate drinking with smoking. If it's not even an option to smoke, sometimes that keeps the cravings manageable. Did you have a cigarette every morning with a cup of coffee? Don't quit coffee, just do something else with it; read a book, or do a crossword or whatever... just make it something you enjoy doing that will occupy your mind while you're having coffee. Sooner or later you'll think about that thing rather than lighting up.

* **Know that you will most likely always have cravings.** Be prepared for that. My dad quit over 10 years ago, and he still gets them sometimes. I get one every couple of days, but it's never an option to smoke, so I don't. With a year under my belt, it's still true that the longer you go without smoking, the easier it gets in general, but there are going to be days and weeks that it gets hard again. When the weather started getting warmer, I had about a week where it was almost as difficult as those first few weeks. Occasionally I'd smell tobacco smoke and breathe in deeper. The smell didn't make me sick like it had been. Cravings were stronger and frequent. I thought about smoking and it didn't strike me as foreign and disgusting anymore. That passed, but it really surprised me. Know that this is always a possibility, and don't let it catch you off guard. Addicts are never truly "out of the woods" when it comes to their addiction. You're always at risk, in some way, of lighting up again.

* **There's no such thing as "just one."** We're addicts and we'll always be addicts. A little bit of nicotine will most likely pull you back into full on cravings and daily cigarettes. This goes for other forms of tobacco too. I'd love it if I could enjoy a pipe or cigar once in a while, but the risk of becoming a regular smoker is too great for me to allow myself to try. That being said:

* **Don't beat yourself up if you relapse.** One day not smoking is infinitely healthier for you than zero days not smoking. Congratulate yourself on making it as far as you have, forgive yourself, and get back on the horse. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs in the world and very few people earnestly try to quit let alone succeed on their first try. Just take it one craving at a time, and eventually those little bits of time will add up to a lot.

* **Set your badge on this subreddit.** Also get an app like QuitNow! or Cessation Nation. Watching that timer tick up is really satisfying and, the idea of having to reset it can be a powerful motivator not to give in to cravings.

* **Figure out how much money you spent per month on cigarettes and sock it away.** You were obviously able to live without that cash when you were smoking, so you won't miss it now. I'm putting mine into savings and just watching it pile up, but if it would be a better motivator, use it each month to buy yourself something fun or go out to eat or something.

* **Become an active poster on this subreddit.** At the very least, upvote everyone asking for help or giving good information. That's what makes it a valuable resource. New quitters get advice and encouragement and more experienced quitters get the confidence boost knowing they're helping others succeed, which keeps them quit.

* **You have done the impossible, and that makes you mighty.** Use your quit to help with other things in your life. Do you want to loose weight? Treat that cheeseburger like a nicotine craving. Are you trying to get the courage to talk to that person across the bar? Treat your desire to sit there and pine instead like a nicotine craving. Do you really need to get some work done, but it's boring as fuck? Treat your laziness like a nicotine craving. It does wonders.

I hope this helps! It certainly helped me to revisit this list. Good luck everyone!

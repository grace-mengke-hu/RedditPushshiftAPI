I am SOOO ready for this!

Been trying to quit for a long time.  I actually stopped for about five months the beginning of this year.  Then a moment of inebriation got me started again.  "Just one night."  Yeah, right.

But I'm ready to stop choking myself, ready to stop smelling like an ashtray, ready to again reap the benefits of being a non smoker.

I just finished my last one about 20 minutes ago.  I've decided to use the patch for a few days even though I don't really think I need it.  The only problem I can foresee is waking up in the morning and trying to convince myself to put it off another day, quit tomorrow.  The problem with that is tomorrow never comes.  Either I quit now or I'll be smoking for the rest of my shortened life.

Day 40 - No smoking

Today marks 40 days without a cigarette after smoking for 25+ years, often a pack (sometimes more) per day. I bought the patch kit and gum but haven't used them consistently even though I probably should have. I did buy a can of pouches which lasted me over a month, but while the buzz felt nice it wasn't the same and would never be a replacement. 

I've had cravings, mostly after the first two weeks as I was dedicated then, but after surviving many traditional triggers:
-Waking up
-After a meal
-Sex
-Driving
-Before and after a flight (I travel a lot for work)
-Commercials on TV
-etc....

I can say that I no longer want to smoke, but feel like theres something missing to fill the voided time with. I still find myself going outside and sitting on a bench or rolling my window down in my truck, but I have no desire to smoke another cigarette after I made it this far.

Has it been super easy, no, but it I'd be lying if I said it's not been a lot easier than I expected. I think the key is to really want to quit and to give yourself no remaining life milestones to extend your quit date towards. I tried 5 years ago with a half-hearted attempt and used vape to replace the oral fixation and nicotine. That was retarded as I wanted the nicotine out of my system and didn't want to replace one habit with another.

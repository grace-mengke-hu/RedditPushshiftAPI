I'm checking in

It got so bad 2 weeks ago, I'm so glad I didn't give in at that time. The last week has been great. Very little cravings, until today when things weren't going the way I wanted. Everyone is counting on me to stay quit. Everyone is amazed that I've quit! I hope I can motivate my friends to quit too.

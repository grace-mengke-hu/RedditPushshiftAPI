Hang In There, and Stay Strong!

I remember when i first saw this sub. I was still smoking. I was a 12 year smoker up to about a pack and a half a day.  I remember looking at the sub and thinking "That must suck, I'd never have the willpower or self control to do that". 

You may be lurking, or you may have just quit and feel overwhelmed. I just wanted to tell you that if I can do it, anybody can do it! It really is just a mentality thing. You have to find a method that works for you, and above all, give yourself some credit!!

You have probably been through much tougher in your life. People just like you do this every day. It's ok to feel anxious or stressed. Let it run it's course. But keep at it. You can do this!  

After quitting, i feel great. I have my sense of smell and taste back, i don't stink, and my body in general feels so much better. Plus, i rarely get sick now, even after being around sick people!  I don't crave anymore either. You'll feel good too, just hang in there! I hope this is the nudge you needed to keep going. Keep it up and stay strong!

My story and a question for those of you who switched to a vape pen to help quit.

I started smoking about 6-7 years ago and have been smoking about a pack a day for the last 5. I made the decision to quit smoking two weeks ago and bought my first vape pen. For me the hardest part of quitting has been the habitual factor, not necessarily cravings. That smoke after every meal, every 30-45 min at work because of nothing else to do, and just going outside to sit on the porch to have a smoke. 

I started replacing the cigs with using my vape pen instead. I didn't stop going outside to use it, or try and cut back on the actual times I was smoking, just replacing those times with the pen. 

I've since dropped from a pack a day to 1-2 smokes a day. I had 1 cig yesterday and hated it. It tasted gross and made me feel like crap for smoking it. This morning I had one more and it was the same feeling. So I've come to decide that I'm officially done smoking them as of right now. 

For the liquid in my pen I've been using a 12% nicotine solution which the associates at the shop recommend I start at from being a pack a day smoker. At what point should I/did you start to reduce that number? 

I know vaping has a bit of a negative stigma attached to it and I admit I always thought it was pretty lame but it has helped me quit. Thank you to anyone who read this and good luck to you in your quitting process as well.

Time to try again!

So I've just discovered this subreddit and it seems like one of the best places I've found so far. The sense of community, combined with with the fact that Reddit is a fantastic way to kill time and distract me should be a great start to stop smoking.

For a bit of backstory, I'm 19 but soon to hit 20. I started smoking socially in 2012, but as soon as I moved away from home to University in September 2013, the freedom and independence hit me all at once and I just smoked often because, well, I could. Nobody else here at Uni I am close friends with smokes, so I don't really have any pressure whilst I'm here to keep going. There's only one real obstacle I can see being a problem.

I smoke weed. I don't smoke it a lot but I smoke it enough for it to be a problem when it comes to quitting cigarettes. I have no intentions to quit smoking weed, but I just worry that I won't be able to resist the temptation to have a cigarette out of the tobacco I will roll my weed with. I know a few people at Uni here who smoke weed but not tobacco, but I don't see that I will ever be able to own tobacco without feeling the need the have a cigarette. 

I have enjoyed smoking, and if it wasn't for the health detrements I would carry on, but life is too short and I am far too young to encourage cancer. I read once that you don't just stop smoking, and that for the rest of your life it becomes a game of 'keep-away', and to be honest that is exactly what it feels like. So my question to you guys is this:

Do any of you plan/carry on smoking weed whilst also giving up standard smoking, and what tips would you give to create a firm psychological divide between the two?

Any help will be much obliged and I'm sure I can give up this pointless habit soon!

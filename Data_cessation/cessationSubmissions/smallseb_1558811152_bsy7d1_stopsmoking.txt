It's been a while

Even after a long period without any craving any Envy of that smelling poison it's still here somewhere in a part of my mind. 

I just had a family fight and I thought so hard : I would smoke right now. 
Deep down inside, I don't because it was hard enough to be were I am right now and I don't have any reason good enough to go for it again.

Stil it crossed my mind and, as each time I'm gladly using this support group. 

Until now it was only work related. Or I didn't had enough upsetting family matters to keep the ease. 
The thing is that this time it touches me. It's not stress related craving that I had until today. 

I'm still upset and it is not over. Yet. If you have tip to ease the inside pain, I'd gladly take it.

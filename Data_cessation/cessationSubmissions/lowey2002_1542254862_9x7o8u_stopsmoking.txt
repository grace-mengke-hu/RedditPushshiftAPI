Trying something new this time

I've failed to quit countless times.  This time I'm not going cold turkey but instead turning it into a game to see how long I can make a pack last.  I keep my smokes in the most inconvenient place possible, wrapped up with an elastic band and with the date/time I bought them written on the front.

The idea is two fold;  make smoking a pain in the ass instead of a stress reliever and give myself as many opportunities as possible to stop myself lighting up.  I'm challenging myself to see how long I can go between buying a pack and then resolving to make it longer the next time.  One day soon I'll buy my last one.

Wish me luck.

3 Days In

Okay, first timer here. I'm not looking for kudos, accolades, pats on the back, or any of that. Just inspiration and accountability, as it were. I see a lot of success stories here, and there must be something to it. I want in on it. 

If I post here, I have someone to answer to if I fail, you know? So,  as long as I'm here, any support or advice I can offer is available upon request.

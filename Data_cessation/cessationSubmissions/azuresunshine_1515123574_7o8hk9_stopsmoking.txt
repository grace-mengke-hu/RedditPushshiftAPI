Has anybody here actually managed to use tobacco non-habitually?

Just to clarify, I'm not asking this for the purposes of bargaining with myself ("*maybe, just maybe I can smoke once a week, it's not a big deal*" you know how that goes), I'm legitimately curious. 

I've switched from tobacco to vaping since the end of november, however, I've smoked three cigars in the last few days because I ran out of eliquid and the new stuff hasn't arrived in the mail yet. I've done this before and had no tobacco cravings once I started vaping again. I'm not gonna deny that it's a relapse, but I usually vape 3 or 6mg liquid and that stops my tobacco cravings completely. It just makes me wonder if it's possible to smoke cigars like once in a month and not end up relapsing.

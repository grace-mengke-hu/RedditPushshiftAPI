Tomorrow is 100 days. I can't even remember I smoked except when someone else reminds me.

I'm so so so grateful. 99 days ago, I had been trying to quit for a solid year. Was smoking over a pack a day and felt like a walking garbage can. Sat down one morning with my pack of smokes, a very large cup of coffee, and the Easy Way audiobook, and did nothing but smoke and listen. POOF! What magic is this? DONE. yeah, the first week I felt a little groggy but it's been all up hill since then. Now, I'm running 5k's 3 times a week plus a longer 6-8 mile run, even after moving to 5k ft from sea level after quitting. Cigs legit smell awful to me when other people smoke, and I seriously do not ever think about the fact that I used to be a smoker, except when I see someone light up right in front of me, or if someone I know reminds me in conversation. So, so, so happy and grateful I finally quit. 

Happy Summer, all!

I'm done.

My husband and I just put out or last cigarettes. We have made the decision, for the last time.  Not only is this better for us, but it will help us be better parents to our one year old. She makes me want to be better, as a person and parent. I'm ashamed I smoked as long as I did. I smoked while pregnant. She is now one year old and I am so tired of it. She shouldn't smell stale smoke on me or her father. She shouldn't have been born with nicotine in her system. I am ashamed of the past, but I am going to change the future. 

This time is the real deal.

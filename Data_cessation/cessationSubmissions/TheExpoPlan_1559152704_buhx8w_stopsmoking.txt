Quit smoking today. I have no need for a nicotine addiction in my life.

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 18 years old. Today, at the age of 26, after countless quit attempts, I am committing to never smoke again in my life. I have told about this to two of my closest friends who are also smokers and want to quit, and I hope that I will set an example to inspire them in time, to quit.

I have read Allen Carr's Easyway in the past, and that book helped me quit for 35 days, last year. However, it was not easy at all. I gained 10 kgs in a month, and it slowed me down. I have been packing on weight since, and I am at 108kgs. However, I learned a lot about myself in that quit attempt, things that give me a better perspective on the smoke free life.

I have decided to make vigorous exercise a part of my life. I feel that the dopamine released during exercise will negate the feelings of withdrawal. This will also help me get into a healthieir weight.

To all the fellow quitters on this subreddit, and the ones that lurk like I have for the past few months, I wish you success in your journey to be smoke free.

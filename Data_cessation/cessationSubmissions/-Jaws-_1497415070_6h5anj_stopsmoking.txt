I'm almost 7 days in, and I'm extremely depressed.

It started last night - or at least, that's when it started getting really bad. I'm dealing with some other life stuff right now, so with that plus quitting I feel like something's got to give. I haven't felt this bad in years, and I've been having thoughts of hurting myself. I'm not going to, but even thinking about it scares the shit out of me. 

For the record, I'm on patches, not cold turkey. But they don't seem to be working as well as I'd hoped. I don't think this will push me back into smoking, but I feel so angry and hopeless right now that I feel like I can't stand it - like I'm going to burst. Has anyone dealt with serious depression while/after quitting? I don't know what to do. I'd forgotten how depressed I really was before I started smoking.

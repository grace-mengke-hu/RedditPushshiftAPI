Square One

Made it 105 days before I fell back into it. That was the longest I had ever been without a cigarette in 10 years. Now I'm resetting my badge and going back to square one. To be honest I could really use some advice right now on beating the mind games. It felt to me like it was inevitable before I started again, and I'd like to know how to avoid that feeling in the future.

If any of you have had a similar experience and overcome it, I'd love to hear about it. The guilt is kind of driving me crazy.

I LOVE SMOKING - but need to quit

I love smoking, the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light up, on the way to work I smoke, at lunch and breaks I smoke, when I watch tv I smoke - I love it!!

Sadly I need to quit - out of paranoia of bad thoughts: cancer, heart attack, stroke.....etc.

I can't seem to stop for very long - sure I have thrown out the packs, ran them under running water, cold turkey, nicotine patches....etc.

Even when I am at work I will say I "forgot" them and bum off a coworker (when in reality I just had a weak moment from trying to quit)- even though I promised I wouldn't stoop that low to bum off of coworkers.

How the hell did you all quit? I am losing motivation and willpower on a daily basis with each quit attempt. 

My old record was 11 months - and I broke it because "I wanted one" that was literally the thought I had .... sure enough my legs carried me to a coworkers office and my lips started to move saying "Can I bum a cigarette" - almost as if I was on autopilot.

Now I am back in the routine of buying cigarettes in the morning - smoking - throwing them away out of anger...only to smoke again later and buy even more cigarettes!!!

I am desperate to stop but it seems part of my brain just refuses to.

HELP!!!

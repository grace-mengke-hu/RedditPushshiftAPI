Over 24 hours and no cigarettes

So! As of 4:20 AM EST this morning, I have been smoke free for 24 hours. Yaaaaaay!!! It's gonna be a rough few weeks but I'm ready for it. Part of my plan was to just stay away from smokers in that time simply to avert a known trigger. Unfortunately, plans rarely work for me and I have to accompany my sister somewhere today. She is a big time smoker and it'll be way too easy for me to just say "can I get a cigarette?" :( It's weird... I don't want to smoke but the craving is still there. There's a little voice in the back of my head saying "just smoke one, you can start day one again tomorrow." but that doesn't even sound too tempting lol. All is good... One day smoke free is not good enough for me so I'm prepared with a sandwich bag full of Jolly Ranchers and deep breathing exercises. Just wanted to vent. Thanks, guys. 

EDIT! I got my badge!!!! Even more reason not to fuck up.

SLow quiT

HI r/stopsmoking. Like many others, I have lurked and lingered with my habit.  This week I feel I have made good progress in changing my relationship to the habit in a new way.

The way I have attempted to quit in the past looks something like:
1) Feel disgusted with self.
2) Resolve to quit
3) Recognize need to feel good about quitting, attempt to feel good...
4) Temptation sets in with anxiety
5) Still a smoker.

Ok. This may be a little gross, but I have been switching over to gum and dip instead. I still smoke tobacco, but usually as a fraction of an herbal mixture. I am happy that I have not smoked anything recognizable as a cigarette for about a week. 

Bit by bit, hour by hour, I am choosing nicotine less. Breathing and meditation have been helping me to feel relaxed when the craving hits me. 

I am actually a pretty fit person, and can run and exercise without hacking up a lung. I think in the past this has convinced me in some cases that my poison habit couldn't be all that bad...But my SKIN is the true teller. I have never had acne before in my whole life! I think that tobacco has triggered this, as my diet is vegetarian. Also, IF I don't exercise, I get SO LAZY. I can't believe how low my energy has been. I have to believe it is because my body is working overtime to filter out all the gunk. 

Technically, I am still a smoker, and need the support of this sub and anyone else to find my strong determination. The more time I spend alone the less I care about anything, really. I want to embrace my social nature and let it help me through this. So I guess this is my progress update. 

Thanks to all the quitters out there for the inspiration!

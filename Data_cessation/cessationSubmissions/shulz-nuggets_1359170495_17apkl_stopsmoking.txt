Day 3 - without a doubt, the hardest day so far. But now that it's over? I feel like a million bucks. 

Had some real ups and downs today with regards to mood and morale. I got real snappy for an hour in the afternoon, but made it through. Went to the gym and lifted/ran for a solid hour until I couldn't anymore. Ate a massive amount of food. All in all, I had a few times today where I thought about walking up to the corner store...**and I didn't!** Allen Carr's advice about not quitting *until you truly want to*, for you and yourself only, has truly made this quit attempt the last one I will ever have to experience. And to cap off the night I'm sipping on a glass of Oban 14 yr, single malt scotch. **A)** it feels so nice to be able to enjoy alcohol without a cigarette right after and **B)** I can't remember the last time I tasted this many flavors in one single drink. **I LOVE BEING A NON-SMOKER**

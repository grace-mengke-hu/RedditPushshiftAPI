Nicotine patch, gum, etc. To help regulate bowels.

Been smoking for 10+ years. Tried to quit a couple times but caved due to stomach pains and having to use the bathroom 20 times a day (literally, no exaggeration).

Getting my wisdom teeth out next week and see it as a perfect excuse to kick the habit for good. My main issue is that I really don't want to suffer the stomach issues while on opiates, weird soft foods, and while bed ridden with no activities to keep my mind occupied. Thinking about trying a patch, as I'm unsure if I'll be able to chew gum. 

Anyone else have similar stomach issues when quitting? Anyone have advice or suggestions? 

Not trying to spend my weekend doped up and angry about pooping, and the following week being sore on both ends. 

Sorry for the graphic jokes, just trying to use comic relief for what will probably be a terrible week.

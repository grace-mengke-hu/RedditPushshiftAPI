3 packs a day to cold turkey. 1 Week Down! Doing Great!

For the three days after I quit I took about 5 shots each night. That really helped with the cravings and made me associate the morning headaches and body cravings with a hangover instead of my withdrawal symptoms. The next few nights were only 2 drinks a night. I don't normally drink so that was a lot for me and it has helped a whole lot along with advil.

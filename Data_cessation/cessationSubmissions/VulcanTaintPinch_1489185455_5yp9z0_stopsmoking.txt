Heartburn Solutions?

So I am on day 42 and have started experiencing heartburn for the first time in my life.  I have even had heartburn 'attacks' the first of which I actually thought was a heart attack.  I have been told that this can happen when quitting smoking, I was a half-pack-a-day smoker for 10 years.  Did anyone else go through this or is going through it? How long did it last?  Mylanta helps some, does anyone have any remedies or over-the counter medication suggestions?  Thank you!!

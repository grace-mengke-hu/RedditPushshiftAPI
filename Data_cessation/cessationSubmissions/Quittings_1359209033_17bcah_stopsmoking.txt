Day 1-9 observations

So it's been over a week, and I'm doing quite fine. Almost relapsed a little on day 7 due to some family issues. I must say the cravings were the worst on days 4-5, I kept reasoning with myself with shit like "well since it seems I can quit this easy, I might as well celebrate it with a smoke", what the fuck.

Day 10 well on it's way, and I'm feeling very good about it all. Stay strong everyone!

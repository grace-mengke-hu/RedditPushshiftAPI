A soldier who can't kick the habit

I'm currently in the army and I am currently having the roughest time quitting. My job gets super stressful at times and I find myself lighting up a cigarette whenever I get the chance. I lasted about 3 months before today where I ended up giving into the craving so I'm on this subreddit asking for some advice or what some of you guys did to quit smoking bc it's affecting my mood and how I perform at work. Thank you

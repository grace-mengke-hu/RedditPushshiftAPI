First day as an ex-smoker

I have tried almost everything to get off my 15 year habit of a pack a day.   Cold turkey, lozenges, gum,  and vaping.   Nothing has worked for me. 

So I bought some patches yesterday and smoked my last cancer stick this morning at 7am.

I am feeling alright.   Still getting cravings,  but I can hold it for now.  I know I am not nicotine free.   I plan to follow the 10 week steps (and shortcut it if I can).

Kinda sucks being a failure at quitting so many times.   Hopefully this time will hold.   Getting pretty tired of this pointless addiction.

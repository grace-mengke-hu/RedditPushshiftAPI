One month!!!

Today marks one month of me being nicotine free. It has been so much easier than I ever thought it would be. I consider myself a non smoker. 

This sub helped me out so much the first two weeks. This is a great place for support and I really appreciate you guys.

I invite you all to join me and not smoke today.

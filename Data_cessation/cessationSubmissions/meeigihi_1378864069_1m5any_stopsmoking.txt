Why do I still have such intense cravings while wearing the patch?

So, I'm finishing up on day 3 right now and I kind of want to die. I'm using the patch but I still have such intense cravings for cigarettes that I feel like I can barely do anything else. Is this normal? Will these feelings get any easier? I have been trying to do other things to take my mind off of it like exercising or sucking on sometime but it's just not helping. Anyone else have this issue too?

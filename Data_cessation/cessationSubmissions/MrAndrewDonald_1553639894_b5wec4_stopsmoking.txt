Got sick with strep. Decided I won't smoke when I'm over my sickness

I got sick with strep throat, so I've been too sick to smoke. I'm on my 3rd day of no smoking, went to the doctor today and got medicine, so I'll be better soon. But i know I'll be tempted to smoke when I'm healthy enough to smoke, but i decided i won't. 


I quit once before for a whole year. It was prompted by a real bad case of the flu. Hopefully I can do the same all over again.

It’ll be 2 months on Tuesday since I quit smoking

Well, I did it, I actually quit smoking. I never ever thought I would do it. Lately, cigarettes haven’t been triggering me, my coworker smokes around me (the same ones I did) and weirdly, they smell good, but I don’t want or *need* them anymore, and browsing here before I quit people would say how “free” they felt or how “liberated” they felt, and I thought *yeah right* but, nope, I feel free. I literally felt like I was in prison. I was imprisoning myself for 9 years of my life. I always wondered what it felt like not to dependent on something and have to worry about when I was going out to smoke next.  All of your guys’s posts are so inspiring and even though it’s easily (for me at least) the hardest thing I ever had to do, it’s so worth it. Just had to get this off my mind 🙂

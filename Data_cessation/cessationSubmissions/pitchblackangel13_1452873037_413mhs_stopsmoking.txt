Day 3...still have my wits!!!

I am rather dumbfounded at how well this quit is going! I have been through this about 30 times before and never lasted more than 2 days. Normally i turn into this big, seething ball of anger and depression. If the dog farts in my general direction, it results in hysterics...seriously. I have learned how to vape properly, and it is amazing! Even with my partner still smoking, I am finding I would rather reach for my vape. Far less hassle!

I know a lot of you here aren't big on vaping, but it's actually working for me, and I am proud as hell right now! :D Whatever works, eh?

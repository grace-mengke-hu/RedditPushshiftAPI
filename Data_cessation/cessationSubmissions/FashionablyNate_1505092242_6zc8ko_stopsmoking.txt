How to quit

You are about to climb a mountain. You haven't climbed a mountain before. You have all the equipment necessary to accomplish this daunting task. Plenty of food, shelter and clothing in a comfortable backpack.

It's going to be slow going as you are not an experienced climber. At first the slope is easy and gradual, but after a while it becomes steeper and more difficult. Already you want to turn back. You stop only part way up and have to decide which direction to go. Upward to your goal or return to the easy life away from this burdensome task.

Who you are on the inside will make the decision for you. Weakness of spirit coupled with habit is the easy, downhill return. Onward and upward is difficult. But, after a while your body WILL change, become stronger. Each step empowers the next and the next and so on. Finally you and your new, healthy self will reach that point-of-no-return. There's no going back and topping out is within grasp. Finally, after all that effort you have gone an hour without a cigarette.

Now, climb another. Mountains ARE hard to climb but not impossible. Grit your teeth and doggedly reach higher. You'll get there.

Climbing with a dedicated friend helps.

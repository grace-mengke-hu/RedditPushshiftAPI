Drunk. Smokin cig right now

Smokin matterhorn rn. Got drunk. Took a puff. Ended up askin ppl for 1. Dofferent ppl till i had 3 so i could smoke when i got home. smoke a couple puffs off a cigar earlier before i went out. Know i smoked so im makin this even while drunk.

Dont regret smokin cuz feel like i wont MAKE A HABIT of it. I smoked maybe 5 cigs total. Social anxiety. Still have not gotten all emotions under control. Must conquer social anxiety. if you want to conquer the addiction: say no to every single puff, no matter the environment. She is a tricky mistress. stay in control.

Ladies and gentlemen i wish you learn from my mistake. my subjecting myself to social anxiety made me 'justify' smoking. i believe it would be better if i did not smoke at all. if you are x days with no smoking then continue on. It is a fight that eill last until the end of time.

We as men and women will move forward with an diamond will. If you are a man summon your inner strength that you know you have. Women you know from whom and where to draw strength. 

i will update you honestly if i slip back into a habit or i double down on discipline for the longest run.

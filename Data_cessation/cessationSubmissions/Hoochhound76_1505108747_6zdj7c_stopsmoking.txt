Off Moles/Chops

Currently 13 days off of taking chops. For those of you unfamiliar that's 1/3 blue am spirit 2/3 greens in a bong, I was going through anywhere from 10-30 of those daily for about 1.5 months. Smashed the everloving hell out of my bong and threw all of my flower away. The nicotine wd is easily the worst shit I've experienced Considering the perceptual changes, nlurry vision, nausea and RLS. Off the bat I wanna say thank u to this incredibly supportive community for getting me through the first five days which were horrendous, for lack of a more severe word. I've quit two packs a day/full tins before, and that's nothing compared to what unfiltered, percolated baccy did to my sorry ass. Cautionary tale to all the college kids out there...Moles should be moderated more than anything

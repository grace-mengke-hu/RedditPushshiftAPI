What is the best free android app for quitting smoking?

Keep in mind, I'm not asking which app has the best success rate for people quitting, just which one has the most features and is the most appealing.

 I downloaded "QuitNow!" but it is extremely limited for the free version. Just wondering if there are any better options out there.

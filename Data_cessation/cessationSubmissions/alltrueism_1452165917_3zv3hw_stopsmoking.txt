I lasted 5 months 20 hours

I caved today.   My trigger wasn't social.   I wasn't drinking.   I didn't have a shitty day.   

I made a decision to buy a pack at 6am this morning because I've had insomnia for weeks.   Since I have to go into work,  I can't stand staying around the house after a sleepless night.  So I drove to work,  and smoked in the parking lot.

I recently started working out,  so I know my lungs are going to hate me.   I'm not sure how I feel right now.   Normally I would be kicking myself in the balls,  because I'm always hard on myself.   

I'm one of those that it only takes one.   Hopefully I can transition into vapor before I buy another pack.  :(

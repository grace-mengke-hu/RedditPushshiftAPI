"Quit" on Monday

So I "quit" on Monday and amusing an e-cig. I also have had two cigarettes yesterday and one today.

I would much rather go cold turkey, but I feel that if I relapsed, I would go full bore again. I do realize that my method is preventing me from detoxing from nicotine, but I feel 2 cigs are better than 20.

Quitters: what are your thoughts on this???

I want to quit but I am under a ton of stress. Tips?

I've been smoking about ten years. I'm 27 and don't have any health insurance. I have a crap ton of financial issues, my car sucks, and so on....
My question is, when I do take that step to quit, are there any things I can do "in the moment" to keep me from snapping?

Well, today's the day

Today is the day I quit smoking for good.  After 3 years of neglecting my health and body, I am calling it quits.  In high school, I was a 3 sport varsity athlete.  In college, I was diagnosed with clinical depression.  Started gaining weight up to 255. Stopped all excercise. Picked up smoking.

A few weeks ago I decided to take matters in to my own hands and got myself to the gym.  Have been going 4 days a week every week.  Kept smoking, however.  It's been a struggle every day just to breath during workouts.  I can't keep killing myself while trying to better myself.

Gave my brand new pack I just bought this morning away to a coworker.  Threw away all my lighters.  Today's the beginning of living again.

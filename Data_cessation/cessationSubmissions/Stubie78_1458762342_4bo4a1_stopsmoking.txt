Relapsed after 10 days. Have i undone all my hard work?

Spent 3 1/2 hours in traffic today, and grabbed a pack of cigarettes before I got home. Only had the one and feel like crap for doing it given how hard I've had to fight the cravings. Am I back to square one or can I just start afresh tomorrow once the nicotine is out my system?

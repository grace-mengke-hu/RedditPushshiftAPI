Looking for some advice to quit during work

I work grave shift at a gas station, so I can buy cigarettes whenever I want unfortunately. I have an e-cig, but I'm not a huge fan of it. We're also not allowed to chew gum. Any tips for me? I'm going on day 2 right now, but I work tonight, so I'm a little worried about it.

My summary

So... I am drunk and 2 weeks smoke-free. I think it is important for me to know I was drunk while I was writing this. 
The first week was not very hard in comparison, because I knew the reason for my suffering . The second week the goal kind of diminished. The will of being smoke-free is so low. I noticed it is no longer my will which helps me staying clean, it is my reasoning which concludes that I am smoke free, because I somehow decided to be. While I am drunk I am craving for a cig, but I know from my experience that I will feel worse if I smoke a cig right now. My desire is so irrational. Atm Iam Wondering how something like cigarettes can be legal.
To my person .. I am at my early 20 and studying (dying) computer science. My biggest Problem is that I always smoked in my deep thinking process.. That means, if I had a tough math task for example, I would have smoked a cig and think about it to find a solution. Now it is missing and I feel like my brain is missing concentration. I also  need longer to memorize things. Im very bad at cognitive tasks right now. I dont want to smoke, cuz it is really disgusting for me. I was really feeling and seeing the negative effects of smoking on me. The reason I am writing this is that I, despite all my contrary feelings, crave for a cig. 
This quote by Avicenna makes me want to smoke a cig right now, but I wont !!!!

So I'm at the smoking area and I suddenly get cravings...just finally realised why

It's common sense really, I thought I was just getting severe cravings but no, there is nicotine in secondhand smoke.

For weeks I've walked past people who've smoked, seen people smoking etc. and not even been phased. I sit outside with my friends smoking for 15 minutes and I'm getting random cravings because of those tiny bits of nicotine floating about.

Damn nicotine, you scary.

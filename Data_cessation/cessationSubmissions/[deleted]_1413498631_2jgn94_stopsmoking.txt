Who was your quit smoking inspiration?

Who quit smoking that you thought would never quit? A parent? A friend? Was it a smoker that inspired you for negative reasons, because he or she never quit, because you saw the decline? Or was it a non-smoker, someone who quit something else like booz, or always lived a healthy life?

For me, it was my father and older brother. As I grew up, my father smoked and almost all the children started smoking. My father then quit smoking, then my older brother, and now all of us have quit.

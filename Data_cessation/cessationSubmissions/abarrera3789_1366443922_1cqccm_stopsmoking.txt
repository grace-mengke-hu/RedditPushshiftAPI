How long does it take for the cravings to stop?

I've smoked on and off for 6 years. I'm about to become a teacher and would like to quit. I've stopped before when I was in situations where I couldn't smoke, but as soon as I returned to my regular life, I picked it back up. How long do you have to be smoke free for the cravings to go away? The longest I've gone is 3 months.

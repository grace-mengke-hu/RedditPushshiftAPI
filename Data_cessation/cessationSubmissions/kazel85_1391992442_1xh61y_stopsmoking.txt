But what if I fail?

SO, I've been patching it for a week now, and havn';t had a single one. But..... What if it doesn't last? I've quit so many times before and here I am.... again..... starting all over.

I hate smoking! I've had enough! I smell, I'm broke all the time, my kids tell me I'm getting cancer and will die! (All the time, daily! It's depressing!) 

I am so unfit I can barely walk up a hill without panting. This was my main reason for quitting. I know that quitting smoking is my first step to being fit and healthy.

But, It's just something I'm doing. I'm not excited about it, I'm just plodding along. I'm not even really proud of myself. 

I know I can never have even one ciggerette ever EVER again! I know I have one and I'm back to square one.

But what if I get off the patches and go right back to it?

I guess I'm asking, what do I do to make sure this is THE LAST TIME I have to do this? (other than just not smoke, because we all know it's not that easy.)

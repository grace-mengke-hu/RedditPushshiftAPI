Going pretty strong #23

Am on day 23 in de Smoke Free app! Last quit attempt I relapsed around the month. Because we learn from our mistakes, I bought the â€˜EASYWAY stop smokingâ€™ book. Just started reading this morning to continue my quit and make it stick!! Also, have a festival this Saturday which will be the hardest to resist yet, but I am motivated :) 

Cheers to everybody who doesnâ€™t smoke with me today! 

And cheers to the lurkers!

200 days and goin strong

feels good, I can tell you that.
Ive also saved a lot of money in that time.
Enough to go on vacation for a few days. Went to Germany, where they still smoke inside clubs/bars. Can't believe I used to  smell so bad.

Even persevered thru the stress of almost missing a plane - like just a few minutes and I would have missed it. While waiting for a train I was staring at the ciggs in the shop but luckly I didn't cave in. 

Gotta be careful now, this added confidence might make me think I can handle it this time and I can just have 1 for good old times...

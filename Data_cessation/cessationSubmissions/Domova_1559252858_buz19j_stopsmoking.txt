Today is my 75th day of not smoking.

Today is the 75th day of being smoke free, 10 weeks of being free of something that I’ve done from the age of 12 till the age of 31. 

I’m now starting to have a healthier diet, to look after my body better now I’m not pumping it with smoke!

Hopefully another 75 days and more of no smoking!

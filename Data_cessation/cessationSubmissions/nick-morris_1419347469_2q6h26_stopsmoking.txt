Drinking hits me harder since I quit

I have always been a fairly heavy drinker and I thought that would cause me to crave smoking, but that really has't been a problem at all. What I have found, however, is that alcohol seems to hit me quiver and harder than it used to and seems to have more of an effect on my behaviour. It's no bad thing thatI cu back on my drinking and it makes me a much cheaper date but I was just wondering if anyone else has had this experience?

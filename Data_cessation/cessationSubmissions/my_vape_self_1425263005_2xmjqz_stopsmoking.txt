And the children are proud of me.

I did [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2duiey/for_those_with_smallish_children_thinking_of/) six months ago.

I took my son to a movie with a friend of his last weekend -- People I have not seen in a while.

They tell me that their son emerged from the playroom and said that mvs_child's dad was going to take them to a movie .... And that the dad had quit smoking.  This was totally random.  No one asked.

Almost a year...the kids are proud of me...You can be that person too.

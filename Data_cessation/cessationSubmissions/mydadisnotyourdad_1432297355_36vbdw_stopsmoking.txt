It's been one week!

I set a quit date and crushed a pack that had 13 left in it. This week has not been easy. I came close to breaking last night. I don't know which one of you said it but I've really relied on "The urge to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not." You guys have been so helpful and I appreciate it! I can do this.

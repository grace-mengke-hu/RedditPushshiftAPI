Starting out

So... just starting this whole quitting thing again. I'm almost 30 and have been smoking since I was 12. Today I've only had a half of one I started last night. I've found it relatively easy breaking some habits (like for breaks at work, walking home at the end of the day, etc...). I've only ever quit once in my life, years ago, when I lasted 6 months. 
My wife and I welcomed our first little guy, Hal, into the world in September. I almost quit before he was born but with the stress and chaos of a newborn I fell back into it. I think I can do it this time. Thanks for listening, all!

I have Cancer and still can't quit. Pathetic :(

So I've smoked for over 20 years.  My entire family smokes.  My mom's dad died of lung cancer.  I know a lady who has horrible emphysema.  I was diagnosed with a ferociously aggressive breast cancer and am now undergoing Chemo.  I figured I couldn't handle the looks and the shame associated with smoking while bald from chemo and that made me go out and buy some patches.  I was at 21 days and ran out of patches so what do I do?  Buy smokes. Pathetic. 
I figured I wasn't making any progress with my addiction to nicotine while on the patch and so when I ran out I talked myself into thinking a few smokes can't hurt till I get more patches (Costco has the best deal on them but its far from my home - I'll get there) 
Am I stuck in a loop now?  I don't see myself ever graduating to the next level of patches as the first one barely got me through the cravings.  Should I start a sub reddit for Patch Addicts? 
I am on this sub reddit all the time congratulating people on their accomplishments and hoping some advice rubs off on me...
Pathetic, I know. Let the shaming begin

Edit:  What an amazing community of people you all are.  Thank you for all of you're great advice and kind thoughts.  I look forward to the day when I can help someone else with their attempts to quit with the same experience many of you shared with me.  It ain't easy but it's the only life we got.

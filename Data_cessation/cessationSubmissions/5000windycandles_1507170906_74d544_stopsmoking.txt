It's time

It's time to just do this. I'm a pack and a half a day smoker. Or actually, I WAS a pack and a half a day smoker. Because I'm not a smoker anymore. 

I cut back to about 10 a day this last week. I kept telling myself I had to wean off it because I'm not a cold turkey kind of person. I kept telling myself that it was working. But I spent this last week obsessed with my cigarettes. How many I've smoked, how many I had left for the day, when I got to smoke again... That's all I can think about.  

I kept telling myself I can't hack cold turkey. But I can. I'm just afraid to. Smoking feels like part of my identity... But it's not a part I want anymore. I used to feel like I'd never be able to finish college and get my degree... but I graduated in May. I used to feel like I'd never get a decent job... but I've been at my job 18 months now and am solidly middle class with a good savings account. I used to feel like I could never lose weight... But I lost 30 pounds this year. I feel like I can't quit smoking, but I can do that too. It's just time to stop making excuses just because it's going to be hard. Just finished a pack tonight. Tomorrow I'll probably have to apologize to my coworkers for my bad attitude. But I've lurked this sub long enough to see that people quit every day. It's not impossible. And its time. 

I'll see y'all in a month when I can post about my first month smoke free in five years.

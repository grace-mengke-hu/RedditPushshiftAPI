I'm done with this.

I'm a pack a day guy for a year and a half now. Just 5 minutes ago I had the last cigarette of my life. 


I was very anti smoking but picked it up in my second year in uni. After a lot of sleepless nights and stress, lowered stamina, a lot of money burned, I decided to have enough of it. 

Thank you ciggs, for helping me cope with the shit in my life, being a buddy with the bottle of vodka, unforgettable time with the first coffee in the morning, picking chicks at parties. 

But it's time to move on. My heart is racing as I type this because of the last one I just had, hopefully the last time it will beat in 5th gear because of you. 

Quit smoking fellas, you will feel better, you wallet will be heavier. Stay strong everyone, it will be better.

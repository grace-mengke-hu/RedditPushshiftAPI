Thank you everyone, 87 days in and I feel incredible.

I don't post much here but I lurk a lot and I wanted to say thank you because having a supportive understanding community is crucial, and you guys have helped.

On another note I feel amazing, my appetite returned with a vengeance and I have made it point to eat healthy. I started running again, it was nice not to be out of breath when climbing stairs but I haven't been this fit since I was in high school. on top of that there the side benefits, I no longer have cold corpse hands and I can smell better.

So once again thanks to everyone here, and to anyone who is thinking about quitting, in the process of quitting, I would highly advise lurking here at the very least and staying with it, you will feel like a whole different person

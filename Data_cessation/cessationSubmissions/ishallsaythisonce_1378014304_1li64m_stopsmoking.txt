Did I fail?

It's been 12 days since I stopped smoking. Yay me! But last night was the first time I went out since I've been a non-smoker. For the most part it was easier than I expected it to be. What surely made it easier is that none of my friends smoke. Early on in the night I would see smokers and feel nothing... Though I was drinking.

However, later on in the night... after downing a substantial quantity of alcohol, I got a whiff of a cigarette. It wasn't a craving. More of a want to smoke... from a drunken mind. I walked around looking for someone to bum a cigarette off of. Couldn't find anyone smoking. I returned to my friends only to go scouting again after a few minutes. This time I asked the bar tender if she sold cigarettes. They didn't. That was it. I didn't look for them after that.

So, I didn't smoke... but not as a result of my gallant efforts. I couldn't find cigarettes. Now that I'm sober I really glad that I didn't but somehow feel down that mentally I caved in to some extent. Did I fail?

Ya'll Are Inspiring

Hey everyone.
All these stories and all this advice is extremely motivating. Subscribing to this sub has made me feel more confident about quitting than I ever have before.

I've been a pack-a-day smoker for four years and just in the last few days I've cut down from twenty, to ten cigarettes a day. On Thursday I'm gonna reduce it to five and hopefully get down to a point where I'm smoking just one or two a day before giving up completely.

At least that's the plan. Has anyone quit successfully with this method?

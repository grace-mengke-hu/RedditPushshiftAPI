Joining your ranks!

Hello fellow quitters! I have made several half-hearted attempts to quit smoking, but the desire to relinquish tobacco feels real this time (if that makes any sense). In my previous attempts, I relied on certain things to assist me - such as nicotine patches or e-cigarettes with a reduced nicotine content. However, none of these really worked; especially since my heart was only 80% into it.

I am tired of waking up with a heavy chest. I am tired of coughing up phlegm or whatever other nastiness it may be. I am also disgusted at the idea of how much money I've spent during my life as a smoker - I could've bought a house by now, I'm sure.

I am quitting cold turkey, but I did download an app where I input how many cigarettes I smoked per day and how much a pack costs me. I really hope I can avoid my cravings, and I hope that as this app shows me my progress in terms of days, weeks, money saved, etc. that I will feel enough pride to stay on track. :)

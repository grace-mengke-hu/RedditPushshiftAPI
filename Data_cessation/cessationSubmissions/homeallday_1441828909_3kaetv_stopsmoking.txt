10 days smoke free. Still not feeling great.

I'm 10 days in, no nicotine at all. I read Allen Carr's book and knew I was ready to quit before that. I've been doing great with cravings and all, but I feel *sooooo* tired. I'm used to running on anything from 4-8 hours of sleep (I have three kids, so two nights are never the same). But since I've quit I feel so very tired. I'm napping and fighting to make it through evenings. I was hoping to feel better than this by now, but I'm trying to power through. Did anyone else feel this way?

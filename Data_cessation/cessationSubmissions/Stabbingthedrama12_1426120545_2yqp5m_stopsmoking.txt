Stopped smoking for the wrong reasons. Relapsed.

Made a throwaway cause reasons. I got with my current SO about two months ago and she never liked the idea of me smoking. I still smoked however but didn't smoke at all when I was with her. It always bothered her and ultimately it lead to her telling me it's either I stop or I break up with her. Really stupid and selfish of her, I know, but besides all that we get along really well and really like each other so I decided to go with it and plan to stop smoking. She gave me about a month to stop cause she understood the cons of doing cold turkey and well around that time I was cutting down and then the day came and well I stopped for the most part. Not really the "most" part, I went 4 days and today on day 5, I relapsed. I found myself getting so much withdrawals, getting annoyed at everything, being very tense about shit, and let's just say I wasn't very pleasant to work with either. So I smoked and everything felt so right, I instantly became calm, even happy that I smoked. I realized that I wanted to quit for the wrong reasons because honestly I really like smoking. A lot. Not that much that I'm going at a pack + a day. Most it was at was probably around half a pack but you catch my drift. I don't want to stop. In the future for sure but as of right now, I don't want too. As for my relationship, I'm gonna talk to her about and hope she understands. Like I mentioned, I like her and she likes me and besides all that we don't really clash on anything.

I'm sorry this doesn't really go with the stop smoking thing on this Subreddit and I respect the people who have made it so far without smoking. I just needed to vent somewhere and I've posted here before but on my not throwaway account and got a couple of great words from you guys. My vents over, my apologies for writing so much.

A little more than 2 years later....

...and I found myself in a jones that wouldn't abate. It is probably associative with the nicer weather and fresh air but I am surprised at how persistent my longings have been. I haven't reached a crisis point, I still have no desire to smoke ever again, but I thought it would be good to share with you guys. Those friends of mine that have been quit for a decade or more say that they never stop having the occasional jones. So I guess this is a small price to pay for freeing myself from slavery. I'll hang in there. You hang in there too.

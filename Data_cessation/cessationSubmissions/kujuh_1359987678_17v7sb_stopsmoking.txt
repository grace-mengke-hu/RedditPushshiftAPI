MADE IT THROUGH THE SUPER BOWL WITHOUT A SMOKE!!!

Starting WEEK 2 today!! I am so proud of myself for not having a single puff of a cigarette for an entire week, and especially last night during the super bowl!!

I did come really close to taking a puff, I even had the cigarette in my hand, but I gave it back and said NO!!

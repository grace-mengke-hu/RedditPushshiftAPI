Day One

Last night I had my last smoke, and I knew I was ready to quit. Recently after every smoke, I have came in and washed my hands and brushed my teeth. It has gotten to the point I just kinda hate the way I smell after. But, of course, I was still smoking to just keep the mood swings away. This morning I woke up, and put a patch on. I know that's not the preferred method of quitting, but it keeps me from feeling like a psycho. I would also appreciate any tips or tricks anyone has. I have been thinking about downloading a quit smoking app, any suggestions?

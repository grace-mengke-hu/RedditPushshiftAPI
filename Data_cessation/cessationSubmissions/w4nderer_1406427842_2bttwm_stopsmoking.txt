The medium game

So probably a thousand people have tried this and it probably doesn't work but what I have going right now is "the medium game" as I am calling it. So I went 4 days smoke free (the longest I had gone in 7 years from 20 a day) and then i caved and smoke a whole bunch. Then from the next day I stopped again and I went 5 days and fell once again and smoked yada yada yada so now here I am I went 6 days and it was super easy didn't think about it once until today, and then like slightly broken clockwork I smoked. So my next step logically is 7 days and then smoke if I even feel like it, (bear in mind now I feel no need to smoke unless I drink and that's where I fell the first time) so is this a fairly decent way to stop. I mean sure any way is great if it leads to stopping but has anyone else tried this path.

Thanks in advance to any responses, love you guys

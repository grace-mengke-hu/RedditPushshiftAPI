Today is my 6 year anniversary of the last time I smoked a cigarette!

To everyone who is thinking about quitting, it was the best thing I've ever done and my life is much better for doing it. Just remember, **quitting smoking is easy** when you realize it's not actually contributing anything positive to your life.

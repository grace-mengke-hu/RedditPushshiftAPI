Starting Today

I've gone from 2 packs a day to around half a pack. Today is the day I smoke my last cigarette. I put it out approximately an hour ago. I've been lifting weights but I want to start cardio and I can't do that while smoking.  I can do this. To all the lurkers in this sub - you can do it too.

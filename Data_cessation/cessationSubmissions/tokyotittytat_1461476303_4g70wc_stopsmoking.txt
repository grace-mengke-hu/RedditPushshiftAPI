Am I too out of shape to quit?

I have been trying to quit smoking for over a year now, and has successfully done so in the past. Thing is, I get hypomanic because of my bipolar II disorder, which made me smoke up to a pack and a half a day for 6 years (one year off cigarettes). I also used to do ballet regularly, but then I stopped due to various reasons, though I must say it certainly helped impede the effects of smoking to an extent. I can also say I was pretty fit then even if I was smoking. 

Anyway, now I don't know where to start after being sedentary for 2 years now. My concerns are: 1) Do I stop smoking first before I focus on working out again? Also, I'm a pretty busy person, I have classes 8-5 while raising a son. Cigarettes sort of helped me out with the stress brought about my immensely busy lifestyle. 2) What are the best alternative stress relievers that can help me quit?

Edit: grammatical errors

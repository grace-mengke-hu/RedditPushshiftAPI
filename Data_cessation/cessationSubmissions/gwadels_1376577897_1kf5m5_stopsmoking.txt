I hate Chantix because it works.

I've started and stopped taking Chantix at least 10-15 times in the past 3 years.  I start because I want to quit and I know it works being that I was able to successfully stop completely the first time I took it.  

Since I started again, I will start taking the medication for about 3 days, then cigarretes start to taste like a sweaty asshole, and rather then stop smoking so that I don't have to taste sweaty assholes every two hours, I stop taking the Chantix, so that it doesn't inhibit my ability to enjoy the delicious, full flavored majesty as God intended.

I'm not going to stop the Chantix this time.  It is the most selfish thing that I actively engage in, and I don't want my 3-year old daughter to harbor resentment towards me later in life when I can't take her to Disney World because it would be too much walking for my soon-to-be diseased lungs to handle.

TL;DR Try Chantix if you can afford to.  It works.  There may be some side effects, but they're much more temporary and manageable then the those of smoking.

Can I get a badge?

I quit officially on July 21 and have been smoke free since then. I'm on the last stage of patches but the nicotine isn't nearly as bad as the habit of smoking itself, for me anyways. So, to help me keep record of quitting, I would like a badge, unless of course I have to wait until the patches are done.

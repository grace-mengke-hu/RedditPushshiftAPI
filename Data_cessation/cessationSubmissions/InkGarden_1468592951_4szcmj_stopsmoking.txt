Terrified but I think I'm ready.

I'm 22 and my chest is constantly in agony and I really cant abide by the smoking anymore... It's constantly in my thoughts and I do believe I'm ready to quit ... I have a half a carton of cigarettes left and when they're done ...they're done, I will stop but I'm terrified of failing ....my willpower is practically zip. Anybody with tips or ideas for support and things for someone chronically stuck in their comfort zone but desperately needs out? Should I finish the carton (cigarettes are monstrously expensive here and I cringe at the waste) or should I get rid of them and just start now ?

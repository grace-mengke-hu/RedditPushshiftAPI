My teeth feel wobbly and hurt especially after waking up or a long drive ever since quitting

I'm on day 27 and feeling really energized for the journey ahead. My teeth and mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher. However, as the title says, I've been waking up with an extremely sore mouth i.e. the teeth (molars and premolars). To the point where it hurts when I eat something tough for breakfast. Any insight as I await my dentist's appointment?

What's poppin, guys? How are you "old" quitters doing?

As you can see, I quit almost 4 months ago. Cravings come and go - but I am still determined to never smoke again in my life. And I am extremely happy saying that.

Still I know I will or rather want to smoke weed again (without tobacco of course) - and I will because of two reasons: first, because I want to smoke weed and get high. 2nd, because I want to show myself I can smoke something without getting back to cigarettes. At the same time I am afraid to pull smoke up my lungs. I don't really want this. But we'll see. I am such a happy nonsmoker, I can't imagine start smoking again. Little cravings I laugh off, because they are... little - as little as other "fantasies" I sometimes have, like quitting university or my job;) 

So how are you doing? Are you even coming back? I come back rarer and rarer - and that's a good thing, that I don't constantly think about smoking or how long I havent smoked already!

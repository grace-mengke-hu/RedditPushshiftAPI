Easyway Advice


I’m currently 6 days without a cigarette and truly mourning the loss of my old friend. I’ve heard a lot about Carr’s Easyway and found the pdf. I’ve just started and he insists on following his instructions as imperative, which I want to do, but that includes smoking as you read the book. For anyone who has followed the “Easyway”, should I follow these instructions even though I’ve already made it 6 days? Of course I want to, but I feel like it could just end up being a set back. I have stopped at chapter 2 and would like to hear some feedback before I proceed. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

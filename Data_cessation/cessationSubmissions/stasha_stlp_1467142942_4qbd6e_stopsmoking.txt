Need Some Motivation at Day 44

I'm in my mid thirties and have smoked since age 20. I smoke 1/4 to 1/3 a pack per day. 44 days ago I quit and I want it to stick.  I've quit 4 or 5 times before each stint lasting 3-4 months before I would start afresh (telling myself I am not a smoker anymore, I can have 1 every now and then).   Old triggers are kicking in: an old blast from the past reached out (and I was happy) -- to remind me "I still hate you".  Job stress. Wedding planning. I need some motivation to keep going.  How do others stay motivated at day 44?  Each new time I've quit, I've enjoyed looking at the quit smoking timelines to see tangible benefits after 20 minutes, after 12 hours, after 1 week... But there are no benefits at day 44.  The next hurdle or milestone is in 5 years and that seems far away and remote. Thanks for your thoughts or advice!

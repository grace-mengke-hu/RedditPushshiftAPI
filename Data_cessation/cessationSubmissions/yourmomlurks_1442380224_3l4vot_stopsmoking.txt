Need help: post quit breath?

Hey everyone. I quit sometime back (can't see my badge on mobile but it has been about a month?)

If you're new to quitting or just quit: It gets better!  I now do not have any cravings other than the most minor of twinges maybe once a week. They pass in 5m or less. 

Experienced quitters: help! What's going on with my breath? I am sure I had terrible breath as a smoker. I expected it to just get better.  However, unexpected problem. 

I just noticed (smell and taste must be returning?) a few days ago that if I kind of suck on my teeth, I get a pretty putrid taste. Swallowing my spit after makes me kind of queasy. If I floss and smell the floss, it smells like cow poop!

I just flossed, brushed, and used a breath-specific mouthwash and I can still kinda taste it!

Is this part of quitting? Do I need to do anything or is there any remedy? Will it get better with good hygiene?

Thanks!

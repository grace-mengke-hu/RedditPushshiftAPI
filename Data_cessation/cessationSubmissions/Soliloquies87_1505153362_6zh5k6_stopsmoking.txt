Day 26: it's a new life!

Heya all,
I can finally say I feel like i'm on the other side of the fence, this time for good. I used to smoke a pack a day (10$) and saved so much money! With all that $$$ I went to salon and asked to get my hair dyed in bright pink! I feel like a new person. Here's all the stuff that changed in a mere little month : 

My anxiety has reduced drastically, to the point where I wouldn't consider myself an anxious person anymore, compared to before where I used to pace and get anxious so easily. It's litterally like a weight on my shoulders that's been lifted.

gained a bit of weight but i'm now going to the gym 4-5 times a week. When I was running on the treadmill my heart would jump to 180-190 bpm and I was easily out of breath, now I barely hit 160 bpm for the same speed/intensity. I'm seriously thinking about starting to train for a 5k when i've always been a couch potato.

My sense of smell and taste is back. I used to smell nothing (like really nothing, it was scary sometimes), now my partner's body spray wakes me up at night, I can smell the flowers (and the piss) when I pass by things. It's wonderful.

I saved so much money! and I'll keep saving it in the future. But when I used to take all my spare money for smoking, now I can treat myself with other things.

My backyard is clean of ash and cigarettes butts. Yay! less cleaning to do.

I saved so many hours smoking (days!), my days are now more efficient and I feel I can accomplish more.

I survived a party last week-end and didn't even think once about smoking even though I was super drunk! that was the thing that scared me the most.

We can do this people. Life is so much better without all that crap :D

First post ever on Reddit. Been smoke free for 5 days.

Hi there. 

I've been smoke free for 5 days. I've been smoking since 1997 which almost makes it 20 years and I've been a pack a day smoker since around 1999. And I'm only 34. 

The longest I've quit before was 10 days, but that was a meditation retreat so I was kind of forced to quit. Then when it was over I just bought another pack. This time is different. I know it's only been 5 days but I've already had a certain  degree of stress and I've been to the shops a few times where I could've easily bought smokes. I've been face to face with smokers the past 5 days and did not ask for a smoke. 

One thing I can honestly say worked for me was a serotonin booster. Basically Prozac. The thing that got me when trying to quit was usually was the dopamine and serotonin crash in the first few days. It made me crazy depressed. This time I started taking the Prozac a few days before my quit date and about 4 days after then supplemented the dopamine with some jogging and exercise. 

I still feel very confident and can't wait to lead a healthy, smoke free life.

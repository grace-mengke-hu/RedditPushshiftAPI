Today

I was going to quit the 30th but I'm going to quit in two hours... My cigarettes are almost finished, I've had enough of it and I don't want to buy new ones. Going to the store now to buy lollipops. I will always have apples and water with me. Today there was an incident as well... My astray fell on my couch and I nearly burned my fingers to a cigarette as well. I'm sick of it. I don't want to be dependent on these filthy things. I will suffer and it will be hard, I just hope I won't relapse this time. I want to quit but my brain wants the nicotine, it feels so contradicting but bleep it, I don't want this anymore. So wish me luck :(

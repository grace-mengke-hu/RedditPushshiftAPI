My biggest struggles with quitting. A message to new quitters.

I quit exactly 22 days ago today. Unlike my flair shows, I have not been smoke free for 127 days. I relapsed. I relapsed and never came back here until today, out of shame. I was ashamed of myself, even though nobody was ashamed of me for relapsing. 

However, in this smoking period of approximately 100 days, I became indifferent to smoking again. Didn't really care for quitting, for whatever reason. I established a smoking environment at work, in my leisure time, at home and so on. Then I found something to push me to the brink of indifference, and eventually over it, again. I became infaturated. 

She's really sweet and I like the relationship we have going on, but she's not the reason I quit. The reason I quit is because I used to not care more than I should have. I didn't care about smelling smoky after work, didn't care about making my room and my sheets stink, didn't care about what it did to my teeth or my health in general. But suddenly, there was this person that made me want to be better than I was. She was the trigger, she's not the reason.

My point is, this willingness was inside of me. All I needed was something to spark it. I've been running on my own willpower for the last 22 days. No nicotine gum, no e-cigarette, frankly no gum at all, no excessive eating, no kind of substitution. That's a mistake I'll admit to, because even today I still feel bits of the urge to smoke when my colleagues and I are in the break room and they light a cigarette. Every time I try to remind myself that I want to be better than I used to be, a healthy person, that quitting has helped me raise my self-esteem, my self-confidence, become a better athlete, become a better lover even. Yet still I feel the urge. It's going to be a battle, you just have to be willing to fight it. If you struggle, don't hesitate to get help to find new motivation.

3 weeks with no sober smokes!

I've managed to get through my every day cigarette cravings with the distraction of exercise - from 8-10 smokes a day cut out cold turkey because it was definitely time I get myself healthier - however I'm still struggling when I go out on the weekend with friends. When I have a few drinks I seem to not be able to resist the temptation of a cigarette anymore and I get so down about it the whole next day. Does anyone have any good tips to help?

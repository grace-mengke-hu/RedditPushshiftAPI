Day 4 does it get easier????

I'm going a little crazy. Seems like every little thing bothers me and puts me on edge. I've been laying in my bed for 2 hours and I have no motivation to get up to do anything! Feel like I'm going to snap. Does anyone know when I'll stop feeling this way? I'm not going to give up but some insight and support is much needed! Thank you!!!!!!!

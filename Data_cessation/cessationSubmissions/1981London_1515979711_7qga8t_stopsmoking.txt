Stomach upset

I'm one month and five days smoke free after having been an on and off smoker for the last 18 years or so... Quick question- when do the stomach issues go away??? I've managed to"quit" for a few months before and never had these issues but this time the stomach issues are really making it difficult, to the point where I think I might need better off smoking!

Smoked on day four of quit - stupid alcohol

I had two cigarettes yesterday, on the fourth day of my quit. I got drunk at a really nice outdour music venue with bonfires and lots of people smoking.

I won't let this drag me down, though. I will stay away from alcohol (and bonfires!) for a while. The first week of a quit is hell as it is, alcohol makes it even harder.

Relapsed after 6 months due to a major life event , keep telling myself I'll stop when things change again

Lost my job and back with my toxic family and I keep saying their the reason I smoke but I know I'm the only one to blame and I just can't stop.

I'm a failure and sub human because I lack the willpower to stop :(

I wanna celebrate 1000 days - with you - by sharing this video which helped me so much. It does not preach all the reasons why you should quit. "That do- not - work!" 

It DOES - take the ammo outta all the arguments you have to keep smoking. " THAT does WORK!"

Takes all the reasons you DO smoke for - and peels it away like Snookies prom dress,........ with ease. Then there's nothing left but for you to take the Promised land,by the hand....and take command .... of YOUR LIFE. 

All the best..... no smoking....NOPE ..

Can't believe it's been 1K days...shakes head...

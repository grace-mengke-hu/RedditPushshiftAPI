I celebrated the 100th day with a 100km cycling trip.

Hi!

Since a few years I have been considering buying a race bicycle. When I quit in February I decided that I would gift myself one after 50 days and so I did. 

The first trip, around 10km, was hell. I'm used to cycling (I'm Dutch...) but this was different. I coughed like I would puke my lungs out. 

Slowly but steadily I increased the distance.  Found some great people to ride with. Made 30km within a week, 50 within three weeks all the while increasing the average speed as well. It took about three weeks to feel my legs before my lungs. 

Yesterday we cycled a little over 100km. I felt like my body was falling apart in the end. But not my lungs!

I feel great and want to tell everybody but you guys are the only ones who will really understand the struggle. 

Keep it smoke free!

Quit smoking today

I just quit smoking today and to celebrate it (pack a day to 0), I am going to use a new reddit account, because it is new life and a new cakeday.

My friend has quit with me and I haven't done a lot of research on what to expect or how to stay smoke free. I couldn't find any help on the sidebar, I thought there was something there, or maybe it was a different sub. I have already applied for a badge and by the time I am done posting this, I should have it.

Though I have a friend who has vowed not to smoke, I would appreciate any encouragement, help you guys can provide.

The reason why I am quitting is because, 

* I have become a slave to this habit
* I am losing a lot of money
* I want to lead a healthier life
* I want to enjoy my food. 

Are there anything else I should add to the list to remind me why this is a good idea?

Quitting Juuls

This may be an unconventional post in here since a lot of people are quitting cigarettes, but I’m looking for some advice on quitting my juul. I’m a college student, so I’m broke enough, but buying a pack a week is really destroying my wallet. I’ve been juuling and smoking an occasional cigarette for about a year. 

I’ve tried quitting twice, but I ended up buying more packs because I had some serious withdrawals. It made me feel like I don’t have the will or strength to cold turkey. Should I buy a different vape and ease down nicotine levels, or does anyone have some advice for cold turkey? 

Thanks in advance!

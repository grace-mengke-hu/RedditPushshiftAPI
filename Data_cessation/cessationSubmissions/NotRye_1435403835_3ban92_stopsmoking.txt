I'm finally at the point where I can hang out with smokers without being tempted.

Last night I spent a few hours at a friend's house.  He smoked like a chimney as usual, and I didn't feel the slightest need to have a cigarette.  When the night was over, I went home, and the first thing I did was change out of my stinky clothes.

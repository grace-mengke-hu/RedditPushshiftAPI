Overcome the smoking addiction

I honestly dont want to quit smoking as a whole. I want it to be like not smoke for a whole week but have some smokes in the weekend. This is my ideal goal. I have quit before 3 months is my record.  So i am starting something new. I smoked today . So from tomorrow till next friday i want to be smoke free. Thats my goal.  The whole aim for this is i dont want cigarettes to control me ..... I want to control them.

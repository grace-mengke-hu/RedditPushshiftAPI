Will power

So I started patches on Sunday, had a huge fight with my partner Monday night bought a pack.. Finished that on Wednesday I'm now back off the smoke again I haven't been too bad over these past 2 days but today's really getting to me I just feel really emotional and my temper is so short anything gets under my skin I am walking everyday cranking my beats but I just feel so weird, any tips? Thanks for reading :)

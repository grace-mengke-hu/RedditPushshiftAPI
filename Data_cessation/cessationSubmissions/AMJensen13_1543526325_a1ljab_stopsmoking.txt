Finally trying to commit to quitting after lies and a couple of failed battles...

I have been vaping for almost two years now and I originally got into it because my ex did it and I thought it was cool.

I have been hiding my vaping from my fiance for a few months now and it is difficult stressful and it plain sucks. Juul has been my fix of choice as of late and I find myself craving it so much when I don't have it for more than an hour. I managed to quit about 6 months ago for about two months, but during a particularly stressful time I really really wanted the buzz, the high if you will. I gave in and ever since I have been hiding it from my fiance. I sneak into the bathroom, hide battery packs and chargers to make sure I can have it charged when I want a hit. 

I am hoping that through some support from this subreddit that I might be able to finally kick it for good. Thanks for reading this. 

Today is day one I just threw out the device and all related parts...

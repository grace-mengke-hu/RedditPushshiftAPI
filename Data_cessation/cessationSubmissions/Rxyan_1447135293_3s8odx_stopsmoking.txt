Day 365 reflecting

Hey guys,
I had no clue this subreddit was here but I just wanted to post about how far I have come and hopefully I can encourage others. I smoked for a year or alittle more. I guess my pack life would be 1. Due to smoking and hanging around smokers, and bad influences, I lost my chance to be on my sports team, which now I regret, but at the time I didn't care. When you smoke you know you are doing the wrong thing, but it's like some odd "force" of nature that was compelling for me. However, I realized that one day I will have kids and a family and I want to live as long as possible to see my grandkids, and be healthy during that time. The replacement for cigarettes was the understanding that I was taking initiative for my health, and I also added meditation which helped tremendously. I highly recommend everyone here to mediate or listen to 20 minutes of nature sounds. We live in a overactive and highly stimulating society, and it is best to relive yourself of that and just "chill". Anyone I know 100% I will never smoke again, and once you think about your future I believe that whoever reads this will have a insight into the benefits of quitting. Also, diet change was a major thing for me. I have cut out high meaty foods for the most part and I have incorporated salads, turkey, and juicing. I wish all of you well!

Day Four: intense allergies

Hey guys!

On day four and pretty happy! I have a much better mind set than any of the other times I've tried to quit (with a big help from this sub :)) 

Anyway I used to have pretty bad allergies to dust and cats but in the past 10 years I have been smoking, I haven't really had those allergies and thought I was over them.

So now I own a cat and have never had any real problems but yesterday and today I have had increasingly harsher Allergy symptoms. 

Taking Benadryl of course but it's not seeming to work as effectively as I had hoped.

I know your lungs/airways/sinuses are supposed to attempt clear out as time goes on, but has anyone else had a return of an allergy?

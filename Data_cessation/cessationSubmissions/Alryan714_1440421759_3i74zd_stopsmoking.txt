Ugh roommates

My husband and I rent out rooms of our house so I can stay home with our daughter who just turned one. I have not smoked in 2 months and 8 days but yet I am still cleaning up after there butts. I don't care if they smoke outside, there is even a container for the butts. I am the only one who dumps it or cleans around it because they always miss. So I told them if they don't start cleaning up I will make the our home a smoke free home. And bow I am dealing with attitude.  Ugh. I just want my front porch to look nice.

I need help

I am going to mark one month smoke free.
But now I'm really missing tobacco.
I don't know why... I used to stand bravely and fiercely against cravings, I was.very happy of not smoking.
Cravings were reducing.
Now it's like I smoked again. After lunch I desired one...
I'm afraid of not standing anymore, and if I fall, I'll feel very bad in front of myself.

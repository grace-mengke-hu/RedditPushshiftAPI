Quitting

I quit for 90+ days in Jan 2017 and started smoking after my husband left for two weeks to help his very sick brother in another state in April or May 2017. I have wanted to quit ever since, but recently my desire to quit has grown. I have tried nicotine patches, however, they give me a giant red rash and feels like my skin is on fire. I can temporarily use lozenges, but these cause me to have worsening IBS symptoms. I am afraid to go cold turkey, but have been taking Wellbutrin for a few days now (Dr. prescribed to help with quitting).  I eat very well (have to because of unrelated GI issues) and exercise 3-5 days a week. I cannot wait for exercise to become easier and less tiring. Any advice or encouragement is welcome! Thank you!

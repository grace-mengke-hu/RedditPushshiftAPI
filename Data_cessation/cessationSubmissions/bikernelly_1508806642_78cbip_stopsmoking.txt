OKAY I'm ready to f*cking quit again.

Just smoked the last in a pack that was given to me. Milked it for 5 days. I just got out of the Navy last week and it's been a little personal stay(inside-and-zero-productivity)cation, but I'm back to doing things and outta ciggies, so here's to ending a LONG 11 years of smoking (minus 6 months last year and 1 month this year).

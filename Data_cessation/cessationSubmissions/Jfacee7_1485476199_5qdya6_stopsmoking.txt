Cigarettes tasting bad!?

I'm 24, smoking more or less pack a day for 10 years and I've toyed with quitting every few months for the last 5 years, sometimes only for a day or two, often for a couple of hours, and the longest streak was 28 days which happened once.

Anyway, I'm still smoking obviously, but I've noticed the past few weeks cigarettes have been tasting worse and worse to me. I feel like I can smell it on my clothes and fingers, where previously I never even noticed a smell, let alone be bothered by it. I notice right after smoking I can taste it in my mouth and on my lips, and it's so awful.. I'm already down to smoking 7 or 8 a day, instead of the typical 20 or more, and I'm not even trying to cut down? It's just gross all of a sudden.

Has this ever happened to anyone all of a sudden? Maybe I'm outgrowing it naturally or my body is trying to tell me something..? I think I'm gonna use this to jumpstart my final quit, which is looking to be way easier than my previous attempts that were such a struggle. I just wanted to see if anyone else went through this, and find out if it's normal after so many years of smoking to start resisting it naturally or just get "over it"?

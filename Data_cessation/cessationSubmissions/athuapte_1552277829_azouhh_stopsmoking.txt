On my 12th day, started something new today!

It is often said that every end is a new beginning. Ending my smoking habit was indeed one. 
Today, on my 12th day of being a Happy Non-Smoker, I started with Meditation. 
I always used to meditate in college days, but hadn’t done so in the past 4 years, since I started smoking. 
Today I meditated for 3 minutes at a stretch. I know it isn’t much, but I believe in baby steps. Being a non-smoker is doing great things to my mental health!

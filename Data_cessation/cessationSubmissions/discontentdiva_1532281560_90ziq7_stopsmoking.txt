I’m quitting vaping today. I’m lacking support at home, I’m hoping to find some here.

Hi all. I hope quitting vaping is alright, I figure it’s close enough? I quit smoking about a year ago. I thought vaping was the perfect alternative. Turns out, it has plenty of risks if it’s own. I think it’s making me quite ill. 

I stopped a few days ago, but due to unforeseen circumstances (my dog got hurt) I’m staying at my boyfriends’ house so she can be away from my other dogs while her leg heals. My bf vapes *constantly* and scoffs at me when I talk about quitting. So I took it up again, and am quitting all over again today. 

I don’t believe vaping is anywhere near as bad as smoking, but it’s not risk free. I’ve had a lot of health issues over the past year, and vaping is not making things any easier for me. 

Anyway, I feel completely unsupported in my current environment. He’s even argued with me that vaping isn’t making me sick, it’s this or that, as if I don’t know my own body. He questions anything I tell him about it. In his eyes, I think vaping is the perfect solution. Honestly, I wanted it to be too. I so badly wanted it to be my cigarette replacement. But having him vape right in front of me as I struggle to open a nicotine patch feels like a slap in the face. 

Has anyone here quit vaping? Please tell me your stories. I need some inspiration/motivation right now. I’m having a really hard time believing that I will get over this. I’ve relied so heavily on vaping the past year, the habit is so ingrained in me, I’m not sure where to begin other than slapping this patch on. I’m not sure how I’m going to get through this. Thank you.

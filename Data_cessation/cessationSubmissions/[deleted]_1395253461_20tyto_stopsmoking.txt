4 months without a cigarette, 3 days without a vaporizer.

I've been in the hospital for about 4 days for a lung infection, and will be here for a few more days. I decided to quit all forms of nicotine. Its just beating around the bush, and at the end of the day, I'm just as much a slave as any other. I love vaping, but I can't stand being addicted anymore.

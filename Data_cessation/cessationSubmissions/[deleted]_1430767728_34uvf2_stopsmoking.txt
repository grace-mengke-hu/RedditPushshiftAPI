Out of sight something something something

So for the first 11 days I was vaping with 0 nicotine ejuice and I was dependent on it, for me the habit is as big of an issue as the addiction. So at the end of day 11 I put the damn thing up on a high shelf Its only a couple of feet away from me right now I can't see it but I know its there, and even though I'm talking about it I have almost no desire to use it. It's been  2 days, I havnt tossed it yet because my parrents and a couple of frineds chain smoke if i go to either I'd rather have it and not need it something something something. I think I just may have this thing beat. I hope so anyway  
side note: I have a haircut later today if I get the hot girl I won't smell like shit! I also have a date with a non-smoker tomorrow morning (night shifts) ~~possibly~~ my 1st date with a non smoker

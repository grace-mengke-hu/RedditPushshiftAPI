After so many failed attempts to quit, I'm going to try again tomorrow. And this time, I will beat smoking.

Whenever I give in to the temptation of smoking, I feel ashamed and powerless, which leads me to smoke more cigarettes. Well I'm fucking tired of not being in control of my cravings. Tomorrow I will give my best shot yet to stop.

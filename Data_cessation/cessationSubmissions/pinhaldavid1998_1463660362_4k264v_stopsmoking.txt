Recent smoker, how to quit

Hey! So I've been a smoker for 2 months (approximately, might be a bit more, less than 3 months) I buy my own pack lately and it usually lasts a week/week and a half. I want to quit because smoking is extremely damaging to my body and I have no pleasure doing the act whatsoever instead, I constantly feel like "smoking is bad and poisoning I want to stop" all the time, the consequences of smoking such as oral, throat, lung cancer, heart problems never leave my thinking. So I want to quit now with no exceptions, not even at parties, 0. So is there tips on how to do it and if I'll have permanent damage for smoking for this timespan? I appreciate any replies :)

How do I heal my lungs after quitting - like inhalants for breaking up and removing tar (essential oils?), healing tissue, increasing lung capacity, etc?

I’ve heard things like peppermint oil when inhaled can help, but I’m curious as to what would be the most I could do to supplement the healing process after smoking?

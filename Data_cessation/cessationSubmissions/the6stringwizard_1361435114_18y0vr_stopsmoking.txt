This evening, as I sit hacking a cough out haha, I have thrown the rest of the pack in the trash.

I've been cutting down and I'm on the brink of a new chapter in life. I don't want harming myself to be a part of that. 

This is it. I'm doing it :) I'm 23 and I've been smoking casually since I was 18, but this last while has seen me at a pack every two days. I've quit for three months before, but my depression was allowed to bring me back to those glowing cherries of false peace haha

Got my badge!!

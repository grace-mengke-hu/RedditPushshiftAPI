Herbal Cigarettes?

Hey guys, i'm pleased i've made it to day 4 (It was tough for me) and i'm happy that i'm a non smoker now. 
However, I feel like I will miss smoking socially/with a drink. 
Do you believe that smoking Herbal Cigarettes  containing no tobacco or nicotine, only on those ocassions could cause a full relapse/reset the cravings?

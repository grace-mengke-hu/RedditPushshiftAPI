I had 2 smokes yesterday after quitting for about 2 years, now I am really shaky, is it related?

I used to smoke a bit (not that much, but I always had tobacco) then I stopped, except occasionally at parties, then yesterday after a stressful couple of days I had a couple of smokes, now I have woken up really shaky, is this related?

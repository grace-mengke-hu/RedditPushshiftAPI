1 day. Can't sleep (clown will eat me)

Sorry, I keep thinking of that old Simpsons episode whenever I say straight up 'can't sleep.'

Been smoking nearly a pack a day for 12, 13 years?  Would manage a month or two of kicking it but then I would slide back.  Coming up on 9 months drug &amp; alcohol free by going to AA and this feels like my first REAL attempt to quit smoking and FUCK ME is it sucking right now.  

Saw doctor on wednesday and he's prescribed wellbutrin to aide in my fight.  This is after 2 previous visits when I've gone to talk to him about help in quitting smoking.  I just feel utterly powerless against smoking and need all the help I can get.  Never taken any anti-anxiety medication in general so combined with sobriety I'm very on edge and self-monitoring about THAT as well.

I dunno, yesterday was first day totally smoke free (using gum too).  From thursday through sunday halved smoke intake each day until I was down to one so a pretty sharp fucking decline from pack a day. 

I dunno, have slept about 3 hours the past 3 nights.  Is this what nicotine withdrawal is?  Having experienced alcoholic sobriety I have faith that however fucking bad it feels it's only temporary and it will change and I can respond to my situation sanely.  Seeing therapist on Wednesday.  Follow up doctor appointment on Wednesday.  I just fear my mask of sanity

I dunno, had to vent.  Thanks

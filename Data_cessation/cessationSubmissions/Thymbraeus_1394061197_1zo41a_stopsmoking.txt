Trying again

So, I'm 23 years old, been smoking since I was 18, and for the past few years it hasn't really been a big problem.  I smoked about 3 cigarettes a day and even now I still am about 2 packs a week (3 at most). However, I work minimum wage and with the new laws passed I am limited to a 28hr work-week.  I run out of money often, and my pay checks are pretty much exactly as much as I need to barely make bills and rent and food.  This month, I'm not sure if I will be able to make my rent, and it kills me knowing that, if I didn't smoke, I wouldn't be having this problem, because I spent about 60 bucks on cigarettes and if I had that I'd be fine.  So, for lent, I'm going to try quitting.  I've tried many times, but I'm going to give it my best and I feel like officially putting it up for others to see is more "binding" and might just hold me to it.  I've never been on this subreddit, but I'm going to be looking around for any tips or tricks...If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love any help.

Wish me best... This time though, I won't be doing it just for me.  I'll be doing it for my Mom and Dad, for my brother and sister-in-law, and for my future nephew/niece that's on the way.

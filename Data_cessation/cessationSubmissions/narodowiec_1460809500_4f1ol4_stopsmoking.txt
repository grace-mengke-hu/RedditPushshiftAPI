Weird case of quitting

Hey, cold turkey quitter here...

Its my fourth day without cigarettes and my withdraw symptoms are uncommon. I was smoking over 10 years, few times succeed quitting and never felt like that. Some weird symptoms from start till now (4th day):

- normal appetite or even a **little** bit lower
- completely **no craving** for cigarettes
- a pale skin on face
- higher body temp like +0,4C (not a fever but noticeable temp difference)
- tinnitus (hum in ears) and I feel like my right ear is a little bit clogged
- minor headache since last 2 days (I bet its because I'm worrying about tinnitus and body temp :)

The only moment that I wanted to smoke was to check if tinnitus and body temp will get back to normal. Anyone had such problems? Is that normal? Help!

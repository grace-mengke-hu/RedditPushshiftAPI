One day smoke free

So far I’ve had about 5 cups of coffee, cooked 3 separate recipes I’ve found online, worked on a painting (which usually triggers me to stress-smoke) and loafted around my apartment. The hardest part is the little cravings that nag in moments of boredom. I’ve only been smoking for 4 years but the addiction is real. I find myself justifying just buying one more pack.. or bumming one off of a friend. I go to university for illustration and naturally all of my friends smoke. It’s going to be hard to say no if someone offers me one on Monday. Any tips or tricks to overcome this? I know it’s up to me but I’m feeling weak-willed to quit.

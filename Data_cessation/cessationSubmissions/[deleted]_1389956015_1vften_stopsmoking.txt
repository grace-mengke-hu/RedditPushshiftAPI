I want a quitting buddy. Any takers?

I think I've figured out why I have such a tough time quitting smoking. I'm not focused enough on the endeavour. I have 303 things going on in my life right now, and not smoking is yet another to keep track of alongside everything else. My brain only has so much it can handle at a time.

I have a solution, maybe. I need someone to message whenever I have a craving, or when I slip up, or just to ramble at about my withdrawal frustrations. If you've quit recently or are about to, and you want a fellow quitter to lean on over KiK or WhatsApp, please contact me over PM so we can exchange details.

I have one cigarette left in the box ...

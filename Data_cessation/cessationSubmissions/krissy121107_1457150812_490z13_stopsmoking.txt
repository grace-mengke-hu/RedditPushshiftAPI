Am I crazy?

Hey all, so this is the first time I've really tried to quit smoking after 10 years. Going on 5 days now, and it was cold turkey...But here's my question, are bat shit crazy mood swings normal? My SO has no clue what's wrong with me and neither do I. I find myself sulking, to having an attitude and being a cunt, to crying nonstop to myself for no reason. I just wanted to know if this is common or if I should see someone because it's not.

Also, any tips and pointers would be lovely on dealing with this! Thanks guys.

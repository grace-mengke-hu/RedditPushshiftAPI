Not even one, right?

Day 4. So far so good. I have gum, I'm drinking water and reaching for fruit instead of tobacco. But now there's a niggling voice in the back of my mind suggesting that one cig won't be the end of the world. 

Don't get me wrong, I won't give in, but come on brain! Focus! Stop torturing me, and get on with it! 

I'm hungry and aggravated, yet proud of myself for having made it to here (says the woman who's not even made it to a week, but hey, I like a bit of credit) and aaaaaargh. 

That's it. 

Sorry you keep reading from me, but I'm guessing if there's one community who can relate, it's here.

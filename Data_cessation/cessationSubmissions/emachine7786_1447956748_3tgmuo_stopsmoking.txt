100 days tomorrow!

99 days in and I can honestly say I've almost forgotten about it completely. There have been a few occasions (while drinking) that I've craved them, but overall I can't believe what a big part of my life they were once upon a time. On a side note, I think the smoker symptoms have finally kicked in. I've been coughing up so much junk for the past couple weeks. It's a good reminder of how awful those pesky things were for me.

Had a health check up and a fitness test 28 days after quitting

Things are looking good! My cardiovascular system has almost fully recovered, largely thanks to spending at least an hour each day doing moderate to intense exercise. 

My general fitness is still below average, and my lung capacity is still at a reduced state. However a diet and exercise plan has been drawn up which will help both recover more speedily. 

It's only been 4 weeks, but already I'm approaching the healthiest state I've been in since puberty. So if you're at that point where you are wondering why you're quitting then remember that this is why. Your body is capable of so many things and cigarettes reduce your abilities and rob you of some entirely.

I'd also suggest to my fellow quitters that you start getting an hour of moderate exercise a day (if you aren't already). It helps with cravings and speeds up the recovery process that your body is currently going through. Just an hour walking at a decent pace (enough to get your heart rate up) will help enormously, go and do it on your lunch break.

Keep up the good work everyone!

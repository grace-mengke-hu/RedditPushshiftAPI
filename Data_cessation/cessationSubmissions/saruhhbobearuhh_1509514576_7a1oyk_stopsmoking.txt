I am done.

As of tomorrow, 11/01/2017, I am done smoking. I am having anxiety thinking about not having my cigarette while driving to work.... or driving home, just not having them at all. But I am giving this my best shot. Please, give me some support, encouraging words, think of me, pray for me.... whatever you guys do. I need all the support I can get at this point!

Any idea how to recondition ourselves from smoking?

I quit almost two months ago. Yet whenever I am stressed, I still get a crazy urge to smoke. These urges usually last up to an hour. Is there any way I can recondition myself into thinking smoking does not equate stress reduction? Thanks for the help strangers :)

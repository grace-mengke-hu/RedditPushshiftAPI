One thing I notice now

Hi guys. I'm 170 days non smoking after 10 years. Feels... normal bow, honestly. At first I felt amazing but now, happily, I feel normal. I don't even think about it or count the days (although this post contradicts both of those statements haha).

One thing I notice is, when looking at all the smokers huddling in the huts at work, they all LOOK like smokers, y'know? A certain colour to their faces and a certain look. Not judging at all as we were all there once, but I'm glad I'm out of that life for good.

Anyway, keep strong even if you relapse or feel weak... keep going!! We got this!! Cheers.

I smoked on New Years

I smoked 5 cigarettes on New Years. This was the only time Ive smoked since I decided to stop. My birthday is on Friday and Im going to try not to smoke. Drinking is my biggest weakness, I know im going to have a few shots and drinks. Im just hoping the alcohol will keep me from wanting to smoke somehow.  Wish me luck guys.

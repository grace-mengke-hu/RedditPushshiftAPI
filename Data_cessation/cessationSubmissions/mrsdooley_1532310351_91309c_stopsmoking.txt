Still scared of cancer/dying young

I quit about 2 months ago with the help of this sub. You guys are all awesome. I started smoking around the age of 12 and was a pack a day smoker until I quit. I'm 35 now so that's like 20 plus years of a daily suicide mission. I know it's great that I quit but am still terrified of dying young or getting a smoking related cancer. I don't feel like a non smoker because my body is so polluted. Does anyone else feel the same? Sorry for the rant I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this

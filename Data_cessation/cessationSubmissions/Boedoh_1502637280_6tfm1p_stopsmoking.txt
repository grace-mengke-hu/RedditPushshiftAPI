Best I've felt in a very long time!!

I'm a 20 year old who has smoked for about 3 years. I quit 2 months ago when I received a phone call from the military (I applied back in 2015 but didn't get in and have been waiting ever since). They finally had a job opportunity for me and I knew this was my passion and I had to do it! I accepted the offer and am leaving September 16th for basic training. Now, I wasn't able to run more than 1 km without falling on the grass, wheezing, with my heart pounding out of my chest. I knew I had to stop for a long time and getting that phone call was the best thing that has happened to me in a very long time. I quit cold turkey. Haven't touched a cigarette since May 29th. Been hitting the gym, I'm able to run 4 minute kilometres without stopping and am doing everything and anything I can to prepare myself for this. Ever since I stopped smoking, I've felt amazing. I picked up new hobbies, made new friends and just overall feel great! I smoked about a pack every 3 days (which isn't a lot to some, but it was killing me slowly). Some days I would drink and smoke a pack that night. Im 6'3, and weighed 153lbs when I quit. I'm currently at 190lbs and 9% body fat! With still 1 month of training before I go! Of course I had some withdrawal symptoms of sweating, I was easily irritated but never once had the craving to smoke. I'm done with it. And won't go back. I just needed that boost of motivation! It truly changed my life and personally saved me. Sorry for the life story but I just had to tell people how great I feel! Thank you for taking the time to read this! (Please be nice, it's my first post)! Have a great day everyone!

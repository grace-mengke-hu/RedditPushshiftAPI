Relapsed one night after two weeks clean - question about withdrawal symptoms.

Hey all, first post here. I'm a snus (Swedish snuff tobacco) user since about 2004, but I hope that's okay. There aren't exactly many forums dedicated to snus quitters. I'm posting here because I guess nicotine withdrawal problems are the same regardless of what type of tobacco products you were using. 

I quit using snus Saturday night seventeen days ago. Last Saturday night, after being clean for two weeks, I caved in at a party. It just felt depressing, like I couldn't enjoy myself, and without nicotine the alcohol just made me feel bad. I took about five snus that night. 

Now, before my relapse the withdrawal symptoms had seemed to start fading away, but since my relapse Saturday night (it's been 3.5 days now) I've felt pretty bad, especially yesterday and today. 

Will a relapse one night after two weeks clean really cause the whole withdrawal period to restart, or should it be quicker this time? And hypothetically, if I were to have one snus after staying clean for a year, would I experience withdrawal after that one? 

I'm curious if research shows that the brain "remembers" its addiction, or if what I'm experiencing now is more psychological than physiological.

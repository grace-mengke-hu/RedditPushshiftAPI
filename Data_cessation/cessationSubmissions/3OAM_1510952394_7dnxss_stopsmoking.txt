One Year

In two days, I will be smoke free for one year. I don't even really think about it anymore. It feels like information that I have that I want to tell everyone, but people who smoke don't want to hear. 

I still root for people who express interest in quitting, but I don't take it as hard when they don't succeed. I'd have my heart broken every day.

However, I can unequivocally state that, earlier in my quit when I was more active here, I don't think I would have made it to one year without you. Cheering you on and being cheered on by you made you feel more like my family. The supportive atmosphere of this subreddit is genuinely and profoundly beautiful.

I shifted my mentality with immense help from this subreddit and the SmokeFree app. In my mind, it became a game. I did all the missions and logged cravings. I worked out a lot. Every day, I'd wake up and try to beat my high score from the day before and now here I am at 363 points and smoking is just not part of my life anymore. It repulses me.

For everyone in this subreddit that is struggling with it, I love you. I believe in you. You have so much strength in you. Just the fact that you're trying at all is a Herculean battle that you already won.

I'm forever behind you. Thank you all for everything.

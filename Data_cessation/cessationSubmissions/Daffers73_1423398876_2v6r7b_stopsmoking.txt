8th day today!

Hi,

After 25.5yrs smoking I gave up on the 1st feb.. I have tried and failed many times but I'm determined to do it this time. I have been given champix by the doctor and it's working great apart from the odd craving. So chuffed I've got to day 8 :) 

I love all the support in this group, I've read through a few of the posts. Well done everyone giving up! :)

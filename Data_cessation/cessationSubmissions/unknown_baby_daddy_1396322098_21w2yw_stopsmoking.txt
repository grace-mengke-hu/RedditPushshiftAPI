Just made it through my first day, nic fitting like a mofo and cant sleep.

How the hell I made it all day without going crazy is beyond me.  I am out of town on business and since ive gotten back to the hotel ive had some serious cravings but nothing to usher a relapse.  Now im afraid I wont sleep, and that I will obsess all night.

I have some snus in my bag just in case but that feels like it would ruin my victory of the day.  Either way, im just ready to have my life back.  I have been a slave.

Edit:  ....thanks for the support.  I ended up just reading un this sub til I got tired and over my fit.  Stay up people.

I’m afraid I’ll cave if I do anything social.

I’ve been a “weekend smoker” for the past few years. I’ve had ups and downs where I’d smoke a few times during the week too, but I am tired of waking up with a sore chest and not being able to breathe deeply.

Anyway, I’m really trying to kick it for good. I am not very social, but almost every time I do anything outdoors or around other people I end up caving and smoking. I was around some people on Monday night who smoked and I didn’t join them. Was super proud of myself. But the weekend is coming up and I am wanting to go out on the town. Every time I go out, and especially if I drink even one beer (I don’t drink often or a lot) I end up smoking. 

How can I remind myself while I’m out not to give in? I don’t want to be too afraid to leave my home out of fear of caving in to smoking that I end up becoming lonely and unproductive.

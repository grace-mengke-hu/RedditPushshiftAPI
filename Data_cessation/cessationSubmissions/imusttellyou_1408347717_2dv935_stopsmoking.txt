It's been a week. When do the cravings go away?

I have been smokefree for about 8 days. I live with a smoker but I've managed to resist the temptations.
But once in a while I daydream about the "good old times" when I used to smoke (it's only been a week but feels like a year!). I still think cigarettes go hand in hand with coffee and alcohol (plus other things like driving) and they aren't complete without each other. And I wonder if I'll ever have those "good" feelings again.


I'm guessing this must be pretty normal. Does anyone have any advice for me? How long did it take for you to stop thinking this way, or does it still happen for you?

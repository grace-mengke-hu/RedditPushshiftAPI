My bf just quit, day 12, what can I do?

He's on the patch and his appetite has increased so I have been making that extra effort and making him lots of delicious food. Checking myself when I'm being whiny because I know he doesn't need that right now. I'm just trying to be the best support possible because I value his success and am very proud of him. What can I do to make it easier?

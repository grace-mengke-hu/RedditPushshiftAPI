What can I do with an extra $120-160 a month?

A pack of Dunhills costs an insane $15 in New York City. I used to go through ~1 per week. Two on the bad weeks. 

Smoking and drinking usually went hand in hand, and alcohol is similarly exorbitantly priced here. I still go out from time to time, but I've stopped buying fifths of mid to bottom-shelf whiskeys that cost $30 a bottle. I usually went through one every two weeks - one a week on the bad weeks. 

I figure I'm saving at least $120 a month - up to $160 at the most. That's $1,440 to $1,920 a year! 

So far, I've splurged on a couple new pairs of running shorts (~$60) and a yoga bag (~$30). By my count, I'm still ahead, so I plan on finally getting around to replacing my running shoes when they finally wear out after months of non-use. 

Saving so much money feels great. Investing that money back into stuff that'll actually *improve* my health rather than destroy it feels amazing. It looks like I'll still finally get around to saving/investing a couple bucks every day! 

If you told me I'd ditch smoking for hippie yoga shit a year ago, I would've laughed in your face. How times have changed! 

p.s. I take back all the mean things I've said about NYC taxes and the ridiculous cost of living .. sort of. 

Here's to another smoke-free week!

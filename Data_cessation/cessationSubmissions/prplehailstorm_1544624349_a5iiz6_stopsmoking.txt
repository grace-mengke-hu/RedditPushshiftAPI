Passed the 6 months mark!

Forgot to post on my actual anniversary but I have passed the 6 month mark. I never thought Iâ€™d see the day. When I tried to quote I expected to fail. I thought I would make it a few days and then give it. Then I kept racking up those smoke free days and here I am. Wooooo! Lol

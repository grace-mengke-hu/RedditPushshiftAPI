where is this power coming from?

seriously though, im still a fucking addict and only went from noob to fake super saiyan - e-cig. BUT the result is already insane. ive been smoking for about 8 years, 6-7 years ago i stopped smoking for like 3 months and then i felt powerful. now its different. only now i understood the power of this enemy.

ps. gonna release a mini blog note in a few weeks about my progress if thats the thing of this subreddit. ill consider my current state as... charging up for 30 episodes.

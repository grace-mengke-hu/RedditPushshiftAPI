How to get over craving related to habit

When you have a craving, change your setting and do something with you hands for 5 minutes, then come back to what you were doing. This is very helpful for the habit part of the addiction. Since smoking gives you a short break from life in a different setting, this hleps you quick by still giving you that break. When I do my homework I would get bad cravings, so I would move to a different room and knit, then go back. For me, this was the most effective method of stamping out my cravings.

Quitting and weight gain?

So, I've gotten to the point where I wake up each morning and can't breathe. I constantly feel unwell, and I've realised it's time to quit.

However I am concerned about gaining weight. As vain as it is, this has stopped me quitting before. Have any of you experienced this and do you have any advice? Thanks!

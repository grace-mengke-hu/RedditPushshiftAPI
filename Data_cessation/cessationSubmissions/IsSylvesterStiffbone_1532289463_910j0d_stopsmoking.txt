Leg day is bliss

Smoke-free for 12 weeks (29th April - I think?) Really enjoying heavy lifts. Airways feel clear, can recover much quicker after a heavy set. Also anxiety has lessened so I don’t fear of passing out or something anymore. Managed two 125kg lifts beyond parallel which I’m fine with. Buff legs ahead! (BrRRrrraHhH!!!!)

Day 1

I always convinced myself that I wasn't a real smoker because I didn't smoke cigarettes and I didn't smoke at work and I didn't smoke at home and I quit when it got cold in the winter. For the first time, I'm acknowledging that I was a smoker. Today is the first day of my life as a non-smoker. Wish me luck.

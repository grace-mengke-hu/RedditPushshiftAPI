1 Year Today!

Today marks 1 year anniversary of smoke free for me. You can do it too.

I smoked for 8 years with couple of failed attempts at quitting but decided to try harder at quitting year ago. I started with using nicotine gums and they worked to cope up with cravings, but in 2-3 weeks I had reduced the number of gums. I did also completely stopped drinking alcohol when I started quitting as I always used to smoke more with alcohol. 

While I was trying to quit, I had stressful days of organizing baby shower, got cold in between, had a baby and somehow that busy time helped me to completely got over gums and since then I’ve stayed nicotine free.

I do get cravings every now but they pass through. I’ve started drinking alcohol occasionally but that no longer create cravings for smoke.

Hoping to stay smoke free forever. If I can do it, you can do it too. Stay strong and blessed.

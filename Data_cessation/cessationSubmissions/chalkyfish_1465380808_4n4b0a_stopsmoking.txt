I turn 29 today and I'm done. This is it. Forever.

I have quit more times than I can count. I keep resetting my badge and then smoke - I'll quit next week, or the week after. Fuck this.

I am 29 today and plan to spend the last year of my twenties smoke-free. And the rest of my life smoke-free. 

I am done. I will reset my badge. See you for my smoke free year in 2017 - 8 June - on my 30th birthday.

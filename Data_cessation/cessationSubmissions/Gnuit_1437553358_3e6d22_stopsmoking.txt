It just kinda happened

I've been moping around about quitting for years, and now I am a little perplexed. 12 days ago I just snapped out of it. I don't even really crave cigarettes. When I do it is like I have a subconscious "No" fairy and the craving dissipates very quickly. It may have had something to do with my dietary changes--I started eating mostly vegan. Not only do I have incredible amounts of energy ( I can hardly sleep!) but I actually CRAVE minerals and greens like never before. Controlling my diet helped me to feel powerful, and I can't really see myself growing fat on zucchini and grapeseed oil. So, that's pretty cool.

I have been going through some REALLY intense emotional release--randomly crying and raging...but that has been motivating me now that I don't push it away and get nervous and smoke.  I can even get drunk without craving smokes, which is HUGE for me.

Thanks to this subreddit for helping me find my own ways to change.

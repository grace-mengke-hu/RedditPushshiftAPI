A personal difference in the "why" and "how"

I'm currently 5 and a half days in, and I can say I'm having an easier time dealing with this now. At the beginning of the year, I made a cliche resolution to quit because it's bad for me and i knew it. I did, lasted 7 days until I saw someone post on here from someone who was on day 9 saying it's not getting easier. I became demotivated, and picked up smoking again until 5 days ago.

5 days ago, I was on my way home with a friend and was reflecting on the smoking addiction I had and how I remember how shitty I felt when my cousin (who I idolized at a young age) smoked a cigarette in front of me for the first time. My heart broke, and I felt really uncomfortable.
This got me thinking about how it'll make my little brother feel if he were to know how older brother smokes, and how much I would be a better influence if I quit. So he never has to see me light up like my dad has been doing for our whole lives.

Between the two tries, this one is NOTICEABLY easier. It may be the reason for quitting, or it may be that I'm too busy with finals to notice. But I hope it stays this way forever.

Being honest with yourself and reevaluation of your actions might be more beneficial than you think! It might make life that much easier.

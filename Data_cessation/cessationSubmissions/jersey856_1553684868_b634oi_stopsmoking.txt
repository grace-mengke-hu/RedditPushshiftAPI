Day 1 on the patch. Wish me luck!

I have been shopping for a new apartment and the potential new expense has me evaluating my expenses. Currently I have a 180 a month recurring purchase with Juul as well as a few packs of cigarettes a week. Having that extra 200 some dollars would help a lot with being comfortable with getting a nicer apartment.

Currently puffing on my Juul while I make coffee and get breakfast. Gonna slap a patch on as soon as I get out of the shower. What should I expect early on? Whats the policy on e cigs like Juul or others?

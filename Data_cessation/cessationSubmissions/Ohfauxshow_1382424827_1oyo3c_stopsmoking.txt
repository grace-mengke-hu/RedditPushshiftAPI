I... don't want to quit.

I know I should quit; but I love it. I'm familiar with all the bad health effects and everything, but I can't seem to want to quit. I tried earlier this year and managed to get down to 2 cigarettes a day (down from about 15). Even not quitting completely I noticed my smell and taste coming back a little bit which was kinda crazy (hadn't smelled trees in the air in like 6 years). 

That being said, there's nothing better after a meal, at the bar with friends, or going for a drive than a cigarette to keep me company. I guess my question is: **How do I make myself *want* to quit?**

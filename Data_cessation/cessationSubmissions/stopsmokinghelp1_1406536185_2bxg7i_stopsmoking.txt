Day 3 struggles

I have tried around a dozen times to quit smoking and usually around a month in I cave and go back to smoking. I don't know exactly how to describe a particular withdrawal symptom I get but it is what always pushes me back to smoking. 

I get this feeling in my skull that there is a piece of my brain that is missing, just a hole in my brain and this 'hole' floats around depending on the task I'm currently doing. For example of I'm talking on the phone the hole feels like it is slightly behind my right eye. If I am in a brought room or in the sun the home feels slightly around or behind my right ear. Currently at in thinking to describe it the hike feels about center in my skull near my corpus colossus. 
By a month into no nicotine the feeling hasn't gone away and I just can't take it anymore it starts to drive me insane and the only thing that works for it is to smoke. 

Has anybody what experienced something like this or have any suggestions on what to do?

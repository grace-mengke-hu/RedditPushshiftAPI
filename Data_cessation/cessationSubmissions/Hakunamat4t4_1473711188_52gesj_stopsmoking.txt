Haven't had a cigarette for 2 weeks now for the first time in 8 years!

I've been a smoker since i was 16, when i turned 18 i begun smoking weed everyday, and have done so to the best of my ability til for two weeks ago. i personally didn't even want to quit i was hospitalized 8-10 times (lost count) so i had to, my lungs kept collapsing, i still smoked after that because it was a very stressful time in my life with school and exams so i did not have the willpower or time to quit. finally i did it for two weeks ago, i still think about them everyday but atm. i still eat some weed everyday to not make it a double rehab. it's been amazing so far so im not close to giving up! I've gotten a bigger appetite which is good for me! (really skinny) i fell like the bags below my eyes have begun fating. my biggest problem atm. is i have no energi and no job so im kinda on a extended vacation, want to find a job until next year where i will continue my education. it just fells like a double edged sword i can't get myself to seek the job because im working on qutting smoking and i want a job so i dont think so much about quitting smoking.

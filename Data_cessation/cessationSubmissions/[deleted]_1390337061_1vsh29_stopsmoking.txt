Can somebody provide a faithful summary of whyquit.com?

Lately i often read on this sub, how helpful is whyquit.com for many people, how it is better than Allen Carr and whatnot. I quit myself 3 months ago via Carr and now help many friends to do the same. The latter isn't that easy, because i'm a little bit asocial and definitely an introvert, so ramming thru people's psychological defenses isn't my strong skill. But i still want to become as educated about the mechanism of smoking as possible.

The website is huge, i don't know where to start. If somebody provided a summary, it would make me understand whether i need to actually drill deep into it. Btw, i wrote a [summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1pvno3/my_allen_carrs_method_summary_please_help_expand/) of Carr's method.

3 days smoke free, I turned down a free cig and I didn't punch a guy!

3 days now, thought it feels so much longer. Bronchitis is still improving, now there's just the occasional gunk-filled cough and the sore ribs that come with it. I guess this must be my first day of real physical withdrawal from smoking because man, it seems like it's constant. 

I went to a corner store before work today where the friendly cashier has sold me many a pack. After I loaded my arms with  snacks and gum I asked out of curiosity (and desperation) if he sold any e-cigarettes. He must not have understood me because he said, "Oh sure, no problem, you take this one!" and offered me a loose cigarette. I stared at it and thought about it hard for a second before politely declining and just getting my snacks and leaving. 

When I got out of the store there was a man standing and half-blocking the door. "Damn, girl, I been waiting for you to come outside! I saw you and I knew I had to talk to you!" I gave the most terse half-smile I could manage and side-stepped around him to walk to work. He followed me and asked for my number. I told him I'm in a relationship and he continued following me, closer now, asking questions about my boyfriend's race and tax bracket and then, when I didn't answer, talking about how things are hard out there for a man like him with no job. I didn't shake him until I ducked into work. I can usually accept a compliment graciously but I wanted to slap the crusty old Black and Mild out of his cracked mouth. 

But I didn't. I didn't take a free cigarette and I didn't take my quitter's anger out on some shady dude. I'm proud of me.

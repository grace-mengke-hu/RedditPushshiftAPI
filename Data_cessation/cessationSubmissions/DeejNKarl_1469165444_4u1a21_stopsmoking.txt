Couple quitting together, looking for sage advice!

Hi all! Just thought I'd reach out to you all about how to cope with quitting with your SO. My boyfriend and I both quit smoking this weekend, and have been chewing Nicorette pretty effectively. Of course it's only been 6 days for me, but I feel really good about myself so far! However, we have already noticed that we are lashing out at each other. We are generally a pretty easy-going couple, no serious fights, fairly good with communication. Has anyone quit as a team before? I would love any sort of advice. 

Side note: I love the positivity of this subteddit. This is a terrible time for us, so to know that we are not alone is very comforting. Thank you all for opening up and sharing your struggles and strengths!

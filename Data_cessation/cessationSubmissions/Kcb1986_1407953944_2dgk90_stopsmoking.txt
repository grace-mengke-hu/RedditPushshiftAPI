I have officially quit today

Today I officially quit smoking.  I had my last one 20 minutes ago and destroyed the rest.  My wife quit ten days ago due to bronchitis and decided to stay off of them.  She inspired me to take action on something I have been thinking for awhile.  The reasons I quit were money (save 1200 a year), tired of coughing, tired of smelling like an ash tray, tired of my car looking like crap, tired of standing in the heat and cold, tired of being ostracized by my work leadership, tired of being fearful of COPD and lung cancer.  That said, I am terrified...  I have been a heavy smoker for 10 years.  I'm not looking pity or advice; I just wanted to say, "I fucking did it."

EDIT:  It has been 27.5 hours and I haven't slipped.  Thanks for all the support, gifs and links;  they helped!

Back at it again

Last time I was around here, I caved after 9 days. I'm now on my 13th day and feeling much better about it

My strategy this time around has been to hold myself accountable. I usually run through a few different thought processes any time I get a craving, such as "Show some discipline", or "This is going to be as hard as you want it to be".  These phrases are simple but have really worked wonders for me. 

What phrases do you tend to stick to whenever a bad craving hits?

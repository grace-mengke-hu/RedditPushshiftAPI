Went to the dentist yesterday...

I had a regular dentist check-up yesterday. Though I wasn't quite where I need to be (I do forget on occasion to floss/brush), I feel like it was overall not too bad a visit.

Except, they found a leukoplakia on my tongue, which for those who don't know, is a white callous-like area on the tongue.

There are many potential causes of leukoplakia, such as repeated irritation of the tongue (biting the tongue, eating too much spicy/hard foods, using tobacco products, drinking too much alcohol, just to name a few). However, something else that is also associated with leukoplakia is oral cancer.

I went to see an oral surgeon yesterday, and he said that looking at the big picture, it doesn't seem like I have oral cancer. I'm gonna meet up with him in 2 weeks to make sure that it goes away.

However, the thought of me possibly having oral cancer, at the age of 25, has scared me straight off of cigarettes. I had already cut back, but this is the final straw. I can handle a few days of anxiety and irritability if it means I don't develop cancer.

Fuck it, I Quit

I've tried to quit so many times, but this time I think I mean it. It just hit me today, how disgusting this habit of mine is. So I'm done, today. Threw out my pack of cigarettes and I'm not looking back. I can already feel the craving kicking in but I don't care.

If my badge says 111 days, sorry, I'm trying to change it but technology isn't my strong suit.

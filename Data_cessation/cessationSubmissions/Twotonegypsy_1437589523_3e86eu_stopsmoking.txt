Thanks for the Help, Time to UnSub

What a great sub!  Thank you all for the encouragement and help.  All the stories of survival and pain helped and will keep helping those who need it.  For me, it is time to go, this is the only remembrance of what used to be.  Smoking is no longer who I am, someone I will never be again.

Thank you again,
Good Luck!

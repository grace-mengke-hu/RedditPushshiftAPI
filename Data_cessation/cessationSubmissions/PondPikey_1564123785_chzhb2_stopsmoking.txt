3 weeks in on Champix, interested in other people's experiences.

So after 25 years of smoking with varied success at giving up I am making massive progress and enjoying it. Smoke free for 2 weeks now. I have never had dreams like I'm experiencing at the moment, they are SO real, more energy and happier. How has this worked for you?

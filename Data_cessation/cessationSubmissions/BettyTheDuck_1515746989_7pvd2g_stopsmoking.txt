3.5 days in and feeling hopeful!

I am SO glad I pushed through the awful cravings of the first 24 hours because, already, I feel so much better. For the first time I feel like there is a light at the end of this tunnel!

Plus, it felt pretty damn good when the optician marked me down as 'ex-smoker' yesterday :D

Physical withdrawal, starting to turn into mental because it hurts

So this is my second time quitting, I quit summer 2014 and that lasted for 8 months, until my birthday where I was an idiot and decided I could "just have one pack" to treat myself. One year later almost exactly, and I've now quit again. I had my last smoke at 2am on March 5th. Mentally it didn't bother me, I was done with it, it was making me gag because it disgusted me so much. And I'm trying to go to the gym and I can't go full throttle because I can't breathe properly. 

The biggest reason, unfortunately, is that I really, really can't afford it. The smokes I had used to be the cheap ones, and over the years they've gone up from $5-6 a pack, and recently they went up to $11.40. Ridiculous. That's almost $350 a month, no thanks. 

Anyways, I don't care at all mentally but it's starting to bother me how tense my shoulders are and how tight and painful my chest is. It hurts to breathe. How do I stop this from me just wanting it to end immediately? I know this won't go away for a few days or even a week, and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.

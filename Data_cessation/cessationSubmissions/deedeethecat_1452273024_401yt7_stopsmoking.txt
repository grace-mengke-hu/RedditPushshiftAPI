I am really struggling!

I am on day 5, with 4 days completely smoke-free. This is my first day off since quitting and I am going insane! I'm trying to keep myself busy and using all of the coping skills I have but there is a voice in my head that keeps on telling me to just have one and I will feel better. I have to keep on telling myself that one will lead to more and I will have to go through this all again. There is no choice, I have to quit smoking. So I can stay the course now or I can repeat it all again which I absolutely don't want to do. I thought I would post here for encouragement. I want to know that it gets better over time!

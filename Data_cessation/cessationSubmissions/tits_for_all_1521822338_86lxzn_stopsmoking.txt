Day 2, nicotine cravings in control but can I smoke up?

Hi,

Please ignore my badge. I am on the 2nd day of my current quit. This being my 100th Day 2 of quitting, I pretty much know what to expect how to manage my cravings and everything. However, over the past 8-12 months I have picked up a new habit.. a weekly joint on Friday nights... And today is Friday. 

Normally, I mix tobacco with my weed, but doing that today will be cheating. So my question is, can I smoke pure weed and will it affect my quit? Will it make me go and buy cigarettes or will I be okay? I really want to quit smoking but I don't want to let go of my weekly joint

Can anybody give some advice for an almost regular smoker?

Hello everybody, 

I'm currently in the phase where I don't smoke everyday, but I do smoke when I drink. The problem is that when I drink, I smoke a pack a night, which translates in at least 3 cigarettes/day. I would really like to stop this habit,  as it makes me smell, it costs me way too much money that I could use for other stuff and the fact that I don't really like to date a girl who smokes. The problem is that all these reasons don't seem to be enough to make me quit. It is the last year that I will live with my parents, so I'm afraid that when I will live alone, I will start to smoke continuously.

A big problem of my smoking is the fact that in each group of friends there is at least 1 person who also smokes, and that they don't really want to stop right now.

I have tried multiple "tricks" to start quitting but they all have failed so far. Is there anybody who was in a similar situation who found a good way to quit?

Sorry for the rambling, I am just scared at the moment and could use some help right now.

Thanks for reading.

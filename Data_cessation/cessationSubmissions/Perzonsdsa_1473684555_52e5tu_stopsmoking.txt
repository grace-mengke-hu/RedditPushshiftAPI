Really really want to quit but don't know how to go about it (Military)

smoking for 4-5 years
around 10ish a day 

ok so i really want to quit smoking but i don't think aids patches or gums will help i feel what's best is if i reduce the number then eventually stop however i got a big problem 

im in the Army... this might not seem like a big deal but it makes it very hard for a number of reasons 


1. about 70% of people in my unit smoke 


2. quitting is hard because it makes me not focus on work properly which can literally put others lives at risk 

3. when it comes to doing field time or being on deployment EVERYONE suddenly starts smokers there's actually people who will take it up while out field or while on deployment yet never touch it back home 


i just need advice or something ive tried quitting in the past but it always goes like this 

probably for about 2-3 days i get very antsy then kind of level out then a few days later the anger and snapping at people comes and i need to have a smoke 

also if it helps i find if i actually have a pack of smokes with me my quitting attempts go a lot longer i don't know why but it just feels better knowing i have smokes at hand for what ever reason

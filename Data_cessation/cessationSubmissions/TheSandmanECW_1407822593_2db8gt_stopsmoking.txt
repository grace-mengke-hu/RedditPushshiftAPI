Im between a rock and a hard place, I need help.

Let me explain. I am going to a music festival Knotfest14 and they dont allow Evapes but they allow cigarettes. Let me get this point across, I didnt stop smoking for the nicotine I stopped for the carcinogens in the cigarette its self. I need my nicotine or else Ill have a terrible time, Ill be craving the whole day and see smokers and just be so tempted. 

Im tempted to buy a pack just for the day, just to have a better day. But I really, really dont want to lose my 21 streak without a cigarette. 

What are some alternatives, I need help brothers.

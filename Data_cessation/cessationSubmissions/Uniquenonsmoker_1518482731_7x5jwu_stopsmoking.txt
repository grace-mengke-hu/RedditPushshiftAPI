It has not been the finest day.

I’m frustrated, disappointed, embarrassed, ashamed and angry. If I didn’t look so awful from sobbing I probably would have almost left the house and gone to the store for smokes. The I’m-so-vain part of me won out though - and so did my lungs. 

I’m planning on brewiing a fresh cup of hot tea (maybe with some whiskey!) and fixing to be asleep as soon as I can. 

Tomorrow is a new day and I’ll be so grateful my ugly cry alone with being able to come here to vent prevented me from going to my old standby of smoking. 

Thanks for hearing me.

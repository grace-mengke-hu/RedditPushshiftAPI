[serious] Quitting with low blood Pressure. [advice]

I had been planning on quitting Aug 15.  In May, I suddenly got very sick.  Symptoms were like renal problems.  Anyway, I lost about 25 lbs in just over a month until I got my appetite back.  (Doc check showed no kidney issues.)  I seem to be doing okay now.  I'm on a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar.  This also lowers blood pressure. 

I forgot to mention I have general low blood pressure issues.   The diet alone sends me swooning.  I'm not sure if it's electrolytes or what.. I think once I've been on it long enough BP will level out. 

It's a lot, but I went ahead and tried to quit smoking on the 15th.  My face became very familiar with the floor after a few hours.  

I don't have insurance so asking a doc is not an option for now.  

If anyone has any experience or suggestions, would you mind sharing?  

tl:dr How do I quit while avoiding low blood pressure symptoms.

Edit: To date, no experiences with abnormally low blood pressure, just the occasional drop.

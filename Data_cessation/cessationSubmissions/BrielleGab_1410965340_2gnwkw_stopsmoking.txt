100 days! Who's coming with me?

So this morning is my 100th day smoke free, and while doing my normal morning routine of reading nonsense on reddit, drinking coffee and giving some props to the newer stop smoking crowd I started thinking about my journey and wondering-

Who is on the same path with me?

There's definitely some names I recognize from my frequent surfing of this sub,  I just wanted to give a shout out to my fellow 100 days-ish folks. For whatever reason we all committed to starting a better life right around the same time! So cheers to us!

Give me a shout on this thread- and if anyone just wants me to check up on them every so often hit me up. I love cheering for us, and just like I know you guys have my back- please know that I have yours :-)

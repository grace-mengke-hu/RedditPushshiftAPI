Weak Moment Last Night, Powered Through

As you can see from my badge it's only been a few days since I've started my quit again, and as I mentioned in a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/5vdrzh/quitting_with_nicotine_patchesdrinking_cravings/), alcohol seems to be my #1 trigger. (Thanks all for the advice, btw!)


Have been using the patches and they have been working 100% for me when I have a normal boring day i.e. work, yoga/gym, dinner and then sleep, but I went out on both Wednesday & last night. Wednesday I gave in after being strong for the first few drinks, took the patch off, and ended up bumming 3 cigarettes off of smoker friends. Felt so gross in the morning, and didn't even crave one the entire next day.


Last night went out to a low key dinner with a friend (who is still a smoker) and afterwards for a drink. Ended up repeating the same behavior, ripped off patch, bummed a cig. But I remembered how gross I felt in the morning last time and how disappointed I was in myself. So immediately after that I ducked into a smoke shop and asked for the Blu E-Cig ($12). Totally not ideal but I'm so glad I did it since for the rest of the night I just puffed away on that when I felt like I needed another one.


Not planning on using it daily, just went the drinking situation rolls around again. So at least if I'm giving in, it's to smoke an E-Cig and not an actual cig!

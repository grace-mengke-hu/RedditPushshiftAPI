Lingering mental associations of certain foods/drinks with tobacco

Five days a week, I used to have an iced red eye and smoke a couple cigarettes around lunchtime.

The same drink tastes like a liquid ash tray now. I can barely get it down without gagging because it tastes like I'm literally ingesting cigarette ash.

A little odd. Can't complain though.

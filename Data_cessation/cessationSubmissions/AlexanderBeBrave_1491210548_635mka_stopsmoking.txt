The easy method works

I quit smoking eight days ago with Allen Carr's easy method, and for those struggling to stop: buy this book!! 
Yesterday I spent the whole day drinking beer in the sun with a few smokers and I did not even consider smoking a cigarette, whereas earlier attempts all ended with the first drink I would have. It feels so good when you realise you can stop easily without thinking about cigarettes the whole time. I cannot encourage you enough to buy this book. 
Many people I tell about this book fear that it is a book with scary facts about smoking, but it's not. It just teaches you to change your way of thinking about cigarettes. Essentially it says: stopping is not a sacrifice because you don't gain anything from cigarettes. It is the other way round and when you realize and firmly believe this, I believe you are  halfway to an easy relief.

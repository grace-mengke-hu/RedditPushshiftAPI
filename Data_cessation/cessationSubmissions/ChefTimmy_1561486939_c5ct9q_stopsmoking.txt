22 days, 12 hours. Now at 0. (warning: dark post, violence)

Welp. My cousin was murdered Sunday night in a fight over $100. Stabbed 6 times and died after 2 hours on the operating table. Found out yesterday morning. I just lost the will to fight the cravings, and, well, whatever. I'm pretty numb right now.

I'll probably quit again next week.

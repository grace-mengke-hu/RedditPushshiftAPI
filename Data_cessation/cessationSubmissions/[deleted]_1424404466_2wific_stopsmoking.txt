Quitting makes it harder to socialize?

I've been trying to quit for while, but I've noticed that now that I don't smoke I find myself in a position of not knowing what to do when a group of friends goes out to smoke. If I go out with them, I'll almost always smoke, a combination of not being able to resist it and not wanting to appear rude for turning a cigarette down. However, if I don't go out I miss valuable time that I could otherwise be spending with other people. Has anyone faced a similar situation to this one before?

Too much or too little nic? Please help

Hey guys, 
I'm on day 14 (NZT) since I had a normal cig. 
I've had on a patch and vaping 18 then 12mg juice.
I'm anxious, depressed, irritable, brain fogged, sore muscles - and having panic attacks I think when I vap

I'm not sure if it's withdrawal or too much nicotine? They have really similar side effects. I've just tried taking off the patch to see if that helps. 

I smoked 30 a day for 20 years. I almost ran out of class today I felt so zombie like and don't want to go back :(

Thanks

First week without cigarettes, but..

So for the first time in ages, I have managed to not smoke one single cigarette for an entire week, however, I have been vaping with a 10ml nicotine in, so I wouldn't call it a complete smoking quit, but I do have some of the withdrawal symptoms, and it's absolutely killing me..

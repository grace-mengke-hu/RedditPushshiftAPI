Day drinking

Going out for a friend’s bday and we Iive for getting day drunk and smoking cigs...almost everyone in our group smokes. I’m 12 days in and am still romanticizing smoking every once in awhile. Especially when I see other people smoking although the smell is kinda grosses me out so making progress. Helpful tips? Wish me luck? Send prayers!

7 Weeks Today

7 weeks is the longest I have gone without a cigarette in 34 years.  I am 46 years old.  I've done it one day at a time, talking to a network of friends who quit previously, taking a lot of tips from the internet about changing my routines, using the Smoke Free app (paid version), and this site.  I also read some of WhyQuit.com, and I bookmarked pictures on my phone of someone dying of lung cancer and an emphysema lung.  On my worst days, and there were not many, I would use all of these tools, white nuckle it, and look at these pictures when the cravings were very bad.  One day at a time, it's been 7 weeks.  I am very grateful.  My addict mind will want to smoke tomorrow because I made it 7 weeks, but I just need to wake up, keep doing what I've been doing, and remember it is just another day.

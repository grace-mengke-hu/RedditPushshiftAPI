let's goooo

Last time I smoked was on the weekend, at a party. Hungover and coughing didn't feel like I'd buy a new pack, and haven't so far, have went on nicotine replacement products. So far feeling good enough, I feel like the worst is ahead of me. Since going from drunk smoker to a "real" smoker (yeah I know) about five years ago I'm yet to go full week ever without smokes despite many, many attempts to quit and the first few days have actually been pretty easy. It's coming and I don't want it to come bc I feel so good and nice about these two days now and walking down the street and waiting for the bus and not even feeling like bumming a cig off someone welp

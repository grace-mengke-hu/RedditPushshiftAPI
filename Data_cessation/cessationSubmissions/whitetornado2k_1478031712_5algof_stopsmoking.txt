8 weeks nicotine free!!

I was a pack a day smoker for 18 years until 8 weeks ago. I'm free and I'm never looking back.

And as an added bonus, I've been depositing the money I would've spent on smoking into my savings account every 2 weeks. A pack is around $6 here after tax, so I've been putting away $84 every two weeks. That's over $2k/year. 

The not killing myself slowly thing is nice, too! :)

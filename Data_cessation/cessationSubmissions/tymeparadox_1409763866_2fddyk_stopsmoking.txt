Ready to quit.

I have 2 smokes left and I really don't even want them. I have been smoking since I was 16 (23 now) and tired of waking up through the night hacking my lungs out. I smoke about a pack and a half a day and looking to kick it cold. If anyone could share some words of advice they would be great. Thank you all for the advice.

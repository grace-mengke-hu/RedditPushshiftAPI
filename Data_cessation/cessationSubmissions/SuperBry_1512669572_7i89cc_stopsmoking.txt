Finalized my divorce, today I start Chantix (again) and Wellbutrin.

I quit smoking several years ago when my daughter was born in attempt to be a better role model for her than my parents were for me. I took chantix, had crazy dreams and compared notes with my then pregnant wife.

Last November my wife's affair came to light and I broke down hard. While I didn't turn to drugs or alcohol (at least not anymore than I would otherwise socially) I did start smoking again.

On tuesday after way too much fighting I just said fuck it and took her bad offer just to get things over with. While I have cut back on smoking on my own quite a bit, today  I am starting a concentrated effort to quit. While I may have a few more to round out the year I hope on January 1st to never have one again.

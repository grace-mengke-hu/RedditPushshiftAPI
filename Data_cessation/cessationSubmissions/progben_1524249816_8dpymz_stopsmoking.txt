I'd fail right now if I hadn't before.

Hey all!

Just a quick reminder of something I feel is important to share. 

I'm in the UK and the sun is out. It's trigger-city. All I want to do is smoke outside like I have done every summer for a very long time. But I won't.

The reason why is that at this point last year, after having achieved a similar 10 week quit, I had 'one' with a beer in the sun. It took me almost a year to stop. This time, I won't get fooled.

I hope all of you struggling stay strong and remember that even 10 weeks in, the cravings threaten to trip you up. Maybe with that knowledge, you won't have to slip up and spend another year smoking like I did.

Drop me a message if you want to chat or need some support, you were all great to me in the early stages of this quit!

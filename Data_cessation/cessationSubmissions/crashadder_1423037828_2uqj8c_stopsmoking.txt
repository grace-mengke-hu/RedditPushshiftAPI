pissed off at cravings

I have zero desire to light one up. I dont miss them. I never liked being a smoker. for the last couple of years i was embarrassed . Its been 79 days. cravings are uncomfortable but doesnt posses any real threat. I am still fragile though. dont know why. weird thing is alcohol or other smokers dont trigger anything. I couldnt care less. I am so much comfortable around smokers than i am at home alone . When i was a smoker I used to stay awake late at night and catch up my favorite shows on Netflix. It was really fun. ever since i quit i am uncomfortable at night time. just want to go to bed before a craving hits. I must add a side note as a background info. I used to wait for my 3 yo son to go to bed before i smoke. Never smoked in his company. I used to wait hours for my nicotine fix. I really need to know that i am recovering and getting rid of this awful addiction. sometimes it feels like i am not making any progress and i will fail anyways.

hoping for some help

I managed to quit smoking from chrismas to feb this year but started up on the habit again.

one main factor that really helped me quit was being involved in a lot of physical exercise, boxing really helped me a lot, i got in with a good trainer for cheap who really worked me hard on the bags and on the mitts, i started running , and jumping rope and exercising a lot and enjoying it to.

occasionally i found that even though i didn't smoke anymore, i found myself smoking in the company of others who i used to smoke with (old college friends) and it doesn't help that my girlfriend smokes a couple of cigarettes a day either.

but then i had to stop and give up paying the fee at the boxing gym and save up some money for school and had to stop boxing as a consequence, days turned to weeks and i haven't put in a single day of practice or running and conditioning since, i picked up smoking again. its just depressing me. i want to quit now though, before it is too late.

any help on what i can do to deal with 

1. the girlfriend and smoking, she smokes, and i want to quit, how do i do this without making her field bad. maybe convince her to quit too? (i got her e-cigarettes last xmas.. it didnt work for her)

2. a lot of the time, coffee breaks at work are synonymous with cigarette breaks, i found myself eating a to compensate for the lack of nicotine (?)

i really want to quit. this feeling of nicotine and toxic work and the endless daily grind is bringing me down. and im hopign that by quitting this bad habit i can assert some control again. 

any help or feedback and criticism would be appreciated.

thanks! :)

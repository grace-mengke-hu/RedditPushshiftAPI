My motivation relapsed

I'm at day 487 and doing well. But .. I stopped smoking after seeing my dad quitting the cigs, who had been a heavy smoker for several years. He was a strong motivation for me and kind of a role model. We praised and encouraged each other .. but today I found out he relapsed. After almost 2 years smoke free. Feels so damn bad.

edit: He was told by the doctor that he HAD to quit. And he hasn't told my mom that he took up the habit again.

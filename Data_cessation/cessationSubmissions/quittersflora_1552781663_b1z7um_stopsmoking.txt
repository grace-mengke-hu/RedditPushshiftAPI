Quit on Mar 14 (Hash/weed/tobacco)

Hello Reddit, 
Been smoking 10-12 cigarettes a day for last 4.5 years in college. However I have been smoking hash/weed too, for last three years (~8-10 joints a day; no cigs when I smoke hash but the hash is rolled in tobacco). Now that I have quit, I'm noticing major stamina increase on the third day itself. Not getting cravings for cigarettes, but to anyone who has been in a similar situation: do benefits of quitting tobacco still hold if you keep smoking hash/weed in organic material (like lavender, sage, mint, etc). 
 
I am also experiencing quitters flu and terrible mucous.

Why I quit: Need to get fit for Air Force; interview and tests 3.5 months from now.

Tldr: quit smoking cold turkey. Can I still smoke hash for a couple weeks and still reap the benefits of quitting tobacco?

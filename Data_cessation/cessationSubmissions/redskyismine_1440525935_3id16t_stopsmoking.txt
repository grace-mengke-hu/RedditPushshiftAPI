This curse has got to go. Attempt number... I've lost count.

I have 2 cigarettes left. I start a new job tomorrow. And I'm sick of this bullshit. I've gone months on end without smoking before, but I always get to the end of the "honeymoon" stage of having quit. The excitement of a journey to freedom fades and I get the creeping thought that I can control myself and have the occasional cig. No more. The fucked up thing is that every aspect of my life drastically improves when I have stopped in the past, but that still was never enough. I need to get back to that point again and realize I can't ever have one or I am back to square one. I have to keep on pushing and avoid a horrific death. I do not want to cut my one shot at existence short over some shredded leaf rolled up in a paper tube. I am done being in a perpetual motion of slavery.

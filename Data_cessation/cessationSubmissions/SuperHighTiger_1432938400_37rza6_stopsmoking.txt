Methods of dealing with missing the smoke

ok so I'm on 71 days and it's starting to get warm and sunny. 

Now when the sun is blazing and I see someone sat outside a cafe drinking a coffee and smoking I feel so jealous. 

Or when I see someone sat in a beer garden drinking their pint with a cigarette I just miss smoking!

99% of the time now I'm fine, still aware I'm quitting everyday but I don't often get the urge anymore. 

I get its just sinking in now that quitting means I'll literally never smoke again. 

So I'm wondering how you guys deal with that?

Also god I've put on weight! Its ridiculous how much weight I've gained.

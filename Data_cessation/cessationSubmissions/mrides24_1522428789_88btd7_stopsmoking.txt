1 Year ago today I had my last cigarette.

I'm pretty proud of myself today. Thought I'd let you guys/gals know. And for all the current smokers out there, never stop trying to quit. I read Allen Carr's 'the easy way' haven't looked back since the last page. It's as easy as he says, just have to follow his instructions.  Cheers everyone!

Day 4, but at the start of the weekend...

Hi everyone. First time poster here. Like a lot of other people, I’ve tried to quit many times. Last year I quit for 5 months, but then relapsed and only told myself I could smoke when I drink. This has led to three day binges over the last half year(I work 4 days a week) where I drink to excess to justify my smoking. This is my first weekend of quitting for good, and I’m nervous about breaking the habit of going to the bar and having a smoke later tonight. I don’t want to fuck this up. I’m going to try quitting drinking for at least a month so I don’t have the two tied together permanently but it may be too late for that. Thanks all.

15 days in: I feel like shit. Sore throat, congested, waking up in the middle of the night with horrible cottonmouth.

This happen to anyone else? And how long until it passes?

I'm also a pretty avid weed smoker, do you think its possible that quitting tobacco has somehow made me more sensitive to weed smoke? Or is this just from my lungs recovering from the tobacco?

On the plus side, the quitting is going really well.

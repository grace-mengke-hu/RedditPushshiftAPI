For those just quitting or about to quit, beware of days 4 and 5

Just a warning, on these days try to stay away from people, including your family as much as you can.  This is because you will become very snappy and make sarcastic/irritable comments.  So if you have to go to work on these days, just remember to check yourself and really *think* before you say something.  Might want to use the anger management trick of when you feel anger, count to 10 before you speak your reaction.  

Also, another thing to look out for is not only will you be irritable, but your entire frame of mind will change.  Like instead of seeing the glass half full, you will see it half empty.  

But do not worry, day 5 things are only half as bad as day 4, and day 6 everything will start looking up.  Exercise is highly recommended to deal with this extra stress also.

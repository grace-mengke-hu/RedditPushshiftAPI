How do people deal with the weight gain?

So craving wises I am fine I don't feel like I want to smoke my only problem is the massive amount of weight I have gained.

I am eating better since I quit and am more active yet in just over a month i have gained enough weight to no fit into my own clothes, if it was the cigarettes keeping this weight off I don't think I want to quit anymore. I basically have no self estimate left anymore and am starting to hate myself. 

Is there any reason in particular for the weight gain or is it just because i quit smoking?

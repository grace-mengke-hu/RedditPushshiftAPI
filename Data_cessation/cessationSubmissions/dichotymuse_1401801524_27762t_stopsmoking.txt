Has anyone used a journal to help them quit?

Good morning,

It's my second morning of not smoking... I feel alright today, kinda irritated and jumpy but nothing terrible. Thanks, guys, for your support :)

I have been writing down my progress and things I've been experiencing regarding my quit in a journal and it has been good so far with motivation and reflection. Have you kept a journal before and has it helped you?

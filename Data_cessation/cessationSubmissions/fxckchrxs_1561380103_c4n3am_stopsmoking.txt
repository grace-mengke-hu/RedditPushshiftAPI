This is my second time quitting since I started two years ago. Want to make a difference as I am turning 20 in 6 days and I feel this is the best way to go. It was costing too much and honestly, it wasnâ€™t something I enjoyed. Does anyone have any advice? I am experiencing restlessness and coughing.

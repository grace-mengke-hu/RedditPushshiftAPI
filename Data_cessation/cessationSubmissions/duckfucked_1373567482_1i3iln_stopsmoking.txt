Today I had a few beers and resisted smoking when everyone in front of me did. But I feel bad for not smoking, rather than happy! Why?!

So I've smoked heavily for the past 2 years. I'm 27, and am manager of a team of 4. My staff all smoke, and until recently I did too.

I stopped smoking on Monday and have been great since. I've fought urges, and beat them, and felt better for it. I've gone the gym, and had much better energy levels as well.

Today however, we went for beers after work. I sat for 1 hour 30 with my team and watched each one smoke 3-4 cigarettes. As I drank more, I craved more. I resisted, but looking back, I only feel stressed. I do not feel happier for resisting.

Maybe tomorrow I will be a happier man, but right now I think I'd be more chilled, or happier even, if I'd have just taken one drag, or enjoyed one cigarette.

Has anyone else gone through this and smoked, or not smoked, and felt better as a result? Please help me justify not smoking beyond purely physical health reasons!

Slipping

I've decided to quit smoking. This is my third attempt. The only thing different about this try is I haven't bought a pack since I decided to quit. Since my quit date I've slipped and had at least one smoke per night. This is MILES better than 20 or so per day. I don't know if I'm failing or if this is good. I mean, it's better than smoking almost a pack per day I guess. I need help getting to zero smokes per day. I need help getting past 3 days with zero smokes. That's my "record". It's so hard.

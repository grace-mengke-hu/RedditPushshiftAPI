First post: I'm almost 3 months in and still burning for a smoke

I smoked for 9 years and quit cold turkey on July 19. I don't know if it's that I haven't found a suitable replacement for cigarettes, or that my moods have been unpredictable lately, or the return of this chilly grey drizzle weather (the most satisfying cigarette conditions!) here in the Pacific Northwest, but I am jonesing so bad. Every time I'm on a walk, drinking alcohol or coffee, out with friends, driving with the windows down, sitting on my porch. I've even been dreaming about cigarettes.

 I haven't broken down yet, but I hate how bad I want to and I'm afraid I will (justifying it to myself as being able to afford it now, or that a few won't hurt, or that I deserve one for accomplishing some small shitty feat). What I hate the most is how pathetic this makes me feel. Before I quit, I thought I was in control, that it would be easy, just mind over matter. Quitting has made me realize how weak I am. 

I guess I'm just posting to see if others feel the same. For support and advice. I could use it.

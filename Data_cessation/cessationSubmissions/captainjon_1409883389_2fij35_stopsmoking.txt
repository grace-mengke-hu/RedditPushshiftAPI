Almost ruined it today

My cars air conditioning is broken and as driving down the road with the windows open, the car next to me, the passenger was having a cigarette and some of the smoke wafted over.  I seriously almost drove to the store and bought another pack.  Then I stopped and thought about how disgusting it was, especially I am shy under three weeks.  While I am not really craving any longer, and when I do see smokers, they disgust me, but the idea of having a cigarette is really consuming me now.  Is this normal after three weeks?  I don't even need Nicorette any longer.

Day 10 and...

I've been having a helluva time on days 9 and 10. I'm annoyed all the time, I get these intense cravings and I get pissed off. I've come super close to grabbing a cigarette and just smoking it. I guess the hardest part is trying to convince myself that this is just temporary. It feels like deep down I believe this is going to last forever even though intellectually I know withdrawal only lasts a few weeks.  


I've been using combination NRT (patches + lozenges) and I'm beginning to wander if I'm just prolonging the agony. Frankly, I'm afraid of what would happen if I took off the patch and quit the lozenges. I'd probably lose my mind.  


I just feel so sh\*tty right now. I wanna get back into the things I enjoy like coding but I've never programmed a computer without a cig in my hand.   


How much longer is this gonna last?

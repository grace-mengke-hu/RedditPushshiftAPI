Quitting Smoking Day 2: It Feels Like I Lost An Old Friend

I've never considered my time smoking as a good thing, nor should I. This is my seventh attempt at quitting smoking over the 5 years I've been doing it. 4 of those years were spent in school, one of them spent working full-time. 
This time has been different, as I'm surrounded by adults instead of students, because of the phenomenal amount of support I've received for quitting, and the discouragement I've gotten from taking it back up again.

There is a void, though, in the back of my mind. The kind of feeling you get when you experience a breakup. It makes the want more. 

I got a little yelly yesterday, now I can feel the wheels of the impending emotional roller coaster slowly starting to spin.

Oh, but in the good news, I had enough energy to run up a hill that I usually laboriously walk up when I go for my daily walks. So that felt pretty great.

Update: My coworker just bought me a protein shake from the sandwich place behind my work, and my boss just bought me 3 packs of gum. Score!

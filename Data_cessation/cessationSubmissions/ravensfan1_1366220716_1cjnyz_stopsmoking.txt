Just A list

Just a list of all the reasons that I am quitting. So that when I am struggling, I can just look back here as a reminder...

 1. I want to be around to see my children grow.
 2. I want to grow my grey hair with my wife.
 3. Cancer SUCKS!
 4. I haven't been to Greece yet.
 5. Bronchitis 3 times per year SUCKS!
 6. I Don't want to stink like cigarettes.
 7. I want to taste and smell food again.
 8. I want to be healthy enough to see our future child grow up.
 9. I Need to put more effort into exercising again, and smoking sucks the motivation out of me.
 10. It's freaking expensive!
 11. It accomplishes Nothing!

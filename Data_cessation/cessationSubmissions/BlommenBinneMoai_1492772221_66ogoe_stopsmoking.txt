Did anyone else dream about smoking?

Recently I had dreams of smoking a cigarette, girlfriend berating me for smoking and giving up, etc.

Now mind you this is a week after quitting, I'm pretty sure it'll stop after a while.

But i was wondering if someone else experienced it and if they have an explanation for it

Tough one today, but I didn't smoke.

Maybe one of the harder days so far. My partner still smokes, so I'm used to being reminded of it due to the smell all the time, but I never go outside with her when she lights up.

Today I was outside with some buddies and one of them smokes pretty heavily. In the past I'd bum off him (or worse - already have my own pack), but today I just kept my distance and waited it out.

The urge is always there, but becomes manageable over time. Vigilance feels good sometimes.

I started smoking again.

I started smoking again after gaining a mass amount of weight from bloating, I went from 30 inch waist to a 36 inch waist. My skin itched from the sudden onset of water weight. 

I gained almost 45 lbs from when I quit Thanksgiving day, till I started smoking a week ago.  I lost 45 lbs in a week of water weight and am back at 32" waist.
I've never had a weight problem or a bloating issue till I stopped smoking. How can I hold off this weight bc I'm telling all y'all that I rather die Young than be bloated to the point it's hard to move and being uncomfortable everyday.

I also lost the ability to focus as well. 

What should I do?

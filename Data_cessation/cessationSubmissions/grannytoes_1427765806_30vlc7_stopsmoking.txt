Increased depression and anxiety...3 weeks in

hi all, it's been about 3 weeks since i stopped smoking. for background info, my school's health services gave me daily nicotine patches (7mg over 24 hours) and i've been using those for 5 days, and i've been been taking prozac (20mg daily) for about a year.

in the past few days i've been extremely stressed out because of schoolwork. usually it sucks but i can handle it ok, but since this past week i've been a wreck. totally unmotivated but also anxious because i'm not getting anything done (the perks of being depressed AND anxious!). i've been alternating between angry, sad, and exhausted, everything feels overwhelming, and i'm beyond stressed and just want a fucking cigarette but i haven't had any. i was recommended toothpicks to ease the craving and they've been helping, but the ones i got are mint flavored and i'm getting kinda sick of the taste.

i wanted to know if anyone else with depression/anxiety issues or taking antidepressants has experienced this kind of increase in symptoms. i'm not sure if it's just because the no smoking or the patch or whatever. i'm glad i haven't relapsed but worried that i will if this keeps happening. any advice would be greatly appreciated.

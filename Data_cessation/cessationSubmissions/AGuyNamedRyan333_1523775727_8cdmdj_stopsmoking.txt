Nicotine gum and vaping dosage?

Hello all!

I have been using a vape to help quit. Been smoking it for about a year now. I use 3mg vape juice and smoke about 100-150 puffs per day (a 60 ml container would probably last me 2 weeks or so. I am going to a concert and don't want to leave for a smoke. I have a 2mg nicotine gum piece that I am planning on chewing halfway through the show. Will it make me nauseous? A few friends who vape said they sometimes do feel sick when using the gum. I'm planning on drinking at the show so that might be a factor also. Wondering if anyone has any idea of the tolerance needed for a 2mg piece. Thanks!

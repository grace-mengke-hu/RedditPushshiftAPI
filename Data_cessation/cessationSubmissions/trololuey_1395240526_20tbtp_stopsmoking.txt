Two Years!

Two years yesterday. That's over 25000 cigarettes I haven't smoked. That's over 60 pounds (~27 kg?) of cigarettes! Not to mention the several thousands of dollars saved.

I'm so glad to be done with that nasty habit. I lurked around this sub for a year or more before finally snuffing out my last cigarette, and I'm grateful for all the support that's found here. It sounds dumb, but sometimes one of the only things that kept me from lighting back up was thinking about resetting that little badge and knowing I'd be starting all over.

Since quitting, my sense of smell has gone into overdrive. I think this is normal for everyone, so take advantage of it. This will be the third spring since I've quit, and I'm actually excited to be able to walk or drive around and actually be able smell flowers blooming a block away. 

Semi-related, last night I was looking through some old pics of me and my wife on vacation a few years ago. I was holding a cigarette in nearly every picture. I can't believe how ridiculous it looked. 

If you're lurking and still trying to make that decision, Quit Now! It *is* hard, but it gets better, and it only gets easier. The benefits are immeasurable in little ways that I hadn't even considered before quitting.

Sorry if this is rambling. When I think about how much smoking controlled my life for so many years, and to realize now that I'm free, I get a little overwhelmed. 

tl;dr Do it for your nose, do it for your photo album.

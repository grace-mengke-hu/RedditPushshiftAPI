60 days smoke-free! Still super grouchy and angry though.

It's been a crazy 60 days.  It's been relatively easy as I haven't had any serious cravings for a few weeks.  I'm feeling 1000x better physically.  I'm still tired in the mornings but don't wake up exhausted and dehydrated like I used to.  It's fun being able to go to the gym again and work out hard instead of at 1/2 energy because I can't breathe.  I got through all the insomnia and depression and other withdrawals that occurred during the early stages that seemed to come in waves and intensified around 3 days, then again at 3 weeks.  Sleep good now, and I'm not sad.  Only lingering withdrawal symptom (and I hope that's' what it is) is that I'm angry all the time.  Well, not all the time, but more often than not I get worked up over nothing and hang onto it for a long time, then once I'm over it, move onto something else to be angry about.  I'm not an angry person, at least I wasn't when I was smoking, so I'm wondering if the smoking was covering up the anger, or if this is part of the quitting process.

TLDR: Feeling better but don't talk to me before I've had coffee.

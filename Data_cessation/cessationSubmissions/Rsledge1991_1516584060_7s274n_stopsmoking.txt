Trying to quit tonight

This may be a long post I apologize. I have been attempting to quit smoking for the past month. I have read Allen Carr book and also decide not to use NRT products. My short fall of quiting is literally the first day in the morning. I will be so excited to quit the night before but when morning comes it changes. I will wake up and my brain immediately rationalizes buying a pack of smokes. It never fails and I continue the same pattern over and over. Any advice or words of encouragement? I really want to do this to make myself and my parents proud. Oh don't know if it matters but I have been a pack a day since I was 13. I am now 26.

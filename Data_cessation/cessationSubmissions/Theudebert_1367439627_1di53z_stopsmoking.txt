Wanting to smoke

Depressed as fuck today.  I've been very depressed lately, and indeed depression is something I've been struggling with my whole life.  But the point right now is that it's making me crave cigarettes like crazy, and the only thing keeping me from smoking is the fact that my gf would be pissed if I smoked.  I don't even know why I'm writing this.  Just wanting to vent a little, I guess.

Pain in my throat and googling it is giving me horrendous anxiety

I was a pack and half smoker for the last 7 years. As of 2 days ago I lowered it to 5. I have smoked 3 today and have been chewing gum and tooth picks. My goal is to be done by Monday entirely what with a new work out class and a half hour commute to school with a non smoker (cars are where I smoke the absolute most). I'm feeling good about quitting and have changed my mental state immensely by reminding myself what cravings actually are and distracting myself until they pass. The few that I have smoked was to taper. I've learned from past attempts that cold turkey is a sure fire way for me to relapse HARD.

My fear is that this tightness in my throat will never go away. That I've done irreparable damage to my lungs and I'm just kicking myself for doing this in the first place  (I didn't start smoking at all until I was 19). Someone please tell me that this went away for you and that it just takes time. It has gone down considerably in the last 3 days but I'm petrified. I can just see the irony and shittiness in being the only one in my family who gets sick after smoking the least.

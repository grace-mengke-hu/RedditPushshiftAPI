I DID IT

Hello,
I am 41 yrs old aND this is the first time I have went this long without smoking! I quit 8 days ago and I am very proud of myself. I am taking Wellbutrin it is helping and does amazing with moods! I feel so clean now that I have stopped. Clean is the only word I can discribe the feeling. My husband also quit with me. We are both smoke free, thank you Jesus!
With a lot of will power, prayer, and support from good friends I believe I have this licked. 
For those of you using Chantix be very careful!!! If you have any mental or emotional issues going on I will tell you to be careful!!

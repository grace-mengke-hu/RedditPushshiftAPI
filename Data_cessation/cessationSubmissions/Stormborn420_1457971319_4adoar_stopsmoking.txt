Day One and I'm Feeling Good

After i casually mentioned to my Boss on Friday that smoking cigarettes is my biggest financial outgoing and that i had given myself until i turn 30 to quit (3 years!), i came back from lunch to an email. He has offered to sponsor me to quit smoking by putting £1,000 in a Help to Buy ISA, as a starting point, while sponsoring me 50p per cigarette i do not smoke (usually 10-per-day). If i manage to go an entire week without smoking, he will double my 'winnings' to £50... If i manage to quit successfully, come September he will give me £1000 bonus!

So, last night i had my last cigarette at about 9pm and i have not had one since. I've never really tried to quit before and aside from the health and other financial benefits i will never have another incentive like this to encourage me to give up.

I've downloaded an app and intend to go cold-turkey... wish me luck!

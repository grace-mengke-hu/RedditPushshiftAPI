I can't imagine myself as a non-smoker. Rebuilding constant smoking situations.

It's been so long - I can remember easily that tomorrow will be 10 years since I started smoking.
I was working at night delivering pizzas with a mate in a car (it was snowing a lot) and he offered me a fancy black cigarette that smelled like vanilla. I was amused, but I said 'nah man, I don't smoke', but he insisted and I though that was not that important - it was a one time experience.
It sounds so stupid when you read that people smoke to 'look cool' but at first it was like that for me, just for a few weeks - I loved the look of a black cig in my hand and I'm ashamed that brought a couple of friends to smoke as well. 
Not so much after that I started smoking because I needed it and not for the looks, and started buying my sister's brand. Years later started with rolling tobacco and still smoke the same brand, funny enough is vanilla flavoured (Amsterdammer), like the first one I smoke.

Well, 10 years later I'm 28 with a better life, a business to look after and the future ahead. All the situations involving my life (working, having coffee around with friends, chilling out in couple..) are accompanied by a cig and I just can't imagine otherwise. I tried stopping but couldn't make it for a day. 

It's frustrating but I'm eager to do it tomorrow, I've been reading your sub for a few days to gather the spirit. I just don't know how to rebuild all the situations, specially the constant smoking while I work in my office. Anyone had a situation like this one to rebuild?

Sorry for the length and thanks for reading.

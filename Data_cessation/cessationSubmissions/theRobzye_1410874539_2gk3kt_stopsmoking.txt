[Day 1] I will now be the most annoying redditor you have ever seen.

So the last 2 days I have smoked 4 cigarettes (compared to the usual 20 a day this is impressive for me). I've been trying to quit since saturday and just haven't had the guts to go all in.

Today I'm quitting (1pm GMT). So this is the first 20minutes of the rest of my life.

The thing that I've been missing is believing that I am a non smoker. After feeling truly sick after my last cigarette and after creepying around this subreddit a lot I think I have gone through a paradigm shift.

But anyway, on to the topic.

I'm going to be posting daily updates on how I've done and what I've struggled with. If I relapse and have a cigarette I'll post it on here as well. I'm not going to beat myself up anymore for falling. Going to take it on the chin and keep pushing.

I don't know if this is normal protocol but I think this will really help me.

ONE YEAR!!

Here I am. One year down. I think the main thing I have learned is that life is not magically better without them, but not being addicted to something takes a huge weight off of my shoulders everyday. The cravings are still there from time to time - but so easy to shake off. No one will be as proud or happy for you as you want them to be - so you have to be happy for yourself. 

Being able to find my own joy as allowed me to really be happy. Thank you all for having a great supportive community. 

One year down - many more to go. Who will join me in not smoking today?!

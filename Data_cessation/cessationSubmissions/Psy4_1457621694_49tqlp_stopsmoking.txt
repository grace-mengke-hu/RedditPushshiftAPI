Smoking again :(

Hello all, i have been on and off smoking for years. I am a very heavy smoker at about 1.5 packs a day when smoking. 

I have been in and off chantix for all this time and will get about 3 to 6 months clean then fall back again  and require chantix to quit. 

I just started up again after 3 months of being off and am getting sick of the chantix cycle! The stuff is not healthy!!

My big problem other then continually disappointing my family and friends is I need to have a smoke every hour as a smoker and it severely affects work. I have to go to clients sites and am billable by the hour. My current work has only seen me smoke for about a month and they were not pleased with how much I was smoking. Not sure they would fire me but it probably won't help me! 

I have chantix so can start again to get over the nicotine piece and then get off again? I could continue to smoke until I can deeply feel i hate it again and maybe quit without chantix but this will take time that may involve some difficult situations at work. 

I have tried vape and other nicotine replacements with no success. I think time and cold turkey and chantix are my only options at this point.

Thanks all this habit is so frequin hard to break!!

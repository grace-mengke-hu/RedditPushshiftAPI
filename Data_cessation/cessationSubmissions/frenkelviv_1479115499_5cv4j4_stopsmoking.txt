Oh man, lucid dreaming with patch

Hey everyone,

I quit smoking yesterday after being off and on for about ten years (longest period of not smoking was three years). 

My girlfriend is incredibly supportive and was happy that I had bought nicotine patches. She happily applied one to my shoulder yesterday evening. I remember thinking: 'hmm, I wonder if there'll be any serious side effects...'

This morning I woke up from the scariest experience of my life: a lucid nightmare, which can only be described as a crossover between 'The Cell', 'The Cube' and most episodes of 'Black Mirror'. I was so distressed I couldn't get out of bed properly... (I did read the manual, but it said nothing about what is apparently a known fact on the Internet: patches at night give you bad dreams.)

I couldn't even find the words to describe the horror I had seen, and she kept saying 'it was just a bad dream, you need to get over it', which made me feel even more powerless than I already did.

Question: have you experienced something similar and found your partner responded this way? What did you do?

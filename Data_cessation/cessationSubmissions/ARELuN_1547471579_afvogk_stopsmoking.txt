More than half year after I stopped smoking...

I'm falling back into occasional smoking, and I absolutely hate myself because of it.

 Lately I've been pretty stressed out, because of school, and I'm struggling to keep calm. I've had an occasional "social" cigarette in the half year I wasn't smoking, but it didn't taste good, and I felt dizzy afterwards. I wasn't bothered by it at all, because I haven't felt a necessity to smoke afterwards and I was still dead on set to not buy another pack again. 

But at the end of the december I had a party at my place, and someone left a full pack of cigarettes here and I didn't find out who left it here, so I kept them instead of throwing out if someone asks for them. Now, when I'm supposed to study I just opened it and smoked one. I feel really bad. I'm still absolutely sure I won't buy a pack of cigarettes again, but I feel really bad smoking one, because this one was smoked from a necessity, not because it was a social one-off. 

I really thought I'm out of this after I didn't smoke for so long, but this mental addiction is a tricky thing. Stay strong friends, don't let your guard down. Right now I'm going to throw away that pack again and force myself to study. Absolutely worst thing is, I don't feel better at all. I don't feel like I released some pressure. I just feel guilty, because I have failed myself. This is truly the worst.

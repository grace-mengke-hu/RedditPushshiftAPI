Should I stop?

I'm in college and I'm 20 years. I smoke 1\-3 cigarettes a day \(not in the weekends\). I also sometimes quit smoking for a couple of weeks just so I don't get addicted. I just really like chilling out and smoking a cigarette. I always tell myself that I'm completely going to quit when I finish school. Should I stop now? I sometimes feel bad because I know it's bad for my health, but is it really that bad if I only smoke so little? I just rlly enjoy it, but if it's really that bad I'm gonna quit.

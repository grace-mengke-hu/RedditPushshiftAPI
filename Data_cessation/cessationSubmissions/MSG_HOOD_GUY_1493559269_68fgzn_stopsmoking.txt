12 Days since I quit

Wow! What a journey it's been thus far. I was a smoker for 18 years. A pack every other day. I've been debating quitting for the last 6months or so. debating turned into determination. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I was fed up with how cigs made me feel physically, drained me financially, and the nasty ass smell of cig smoke. 
I went to my doctor and got the 21mg patches. It was supposed to be a 8week program. However, I quit wearing the patch after day 2 and just went cold turkey! Best decision I could of made.

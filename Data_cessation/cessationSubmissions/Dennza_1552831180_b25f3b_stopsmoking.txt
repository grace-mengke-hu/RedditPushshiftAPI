Acne breakout after quitting cigarettes

Hello to all of you good people. I recently quit smoking cigarettes (4 days to be exact) and started vaping . I am currently having an acne breakout on my forehead. I have never had that much on my face as a whole that I have on my forehead now. My question is - do you think that this is a result of me quitting cigarettes or a result of me vaping. Did you have this problem before? How did you treat it ? Just for the record 21 yrs Male . Thank you in advance! :)

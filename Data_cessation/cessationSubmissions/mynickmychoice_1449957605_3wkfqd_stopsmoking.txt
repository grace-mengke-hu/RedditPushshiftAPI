Today I smoked my 3rd cigarette till date. Will I experience withdrawal symptoms?

I'm 22 years old and been experiencing a lot of stress in my life lately. I smoked my first cigarette just to act cool and also to not feel left out from my friends who smoke. I am not feeling any craving to smoke till now, but I don't want to be addicted to smoking. I am scared and ashamed of what I have become.

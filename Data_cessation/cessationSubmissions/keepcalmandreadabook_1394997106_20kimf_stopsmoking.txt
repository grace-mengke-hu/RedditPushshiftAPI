Came very close to smoking last night...

...was with a lady friend of mine last night, super cute, totally my type, hadn't visited her in over a year, she kept smoking my favorite kind of cigarettes, too, and at one point she asked me if I still smoked, I said no and that I was fighting the urge to ask to bum one since she had my favorite kind (and also because I was nervous, she was cute, etc). Luckily she admitted she herself wants to quit someday, and said she was definitely **not** going to give me one because she knows how hard it is quitting. Honestly I probably would have smoked one if she offered, so I'm really happy now that she was stronger than me and refused to give me one. Tomorrow I'll have two weeks, so I'm happy now I didn't smoke. For some reason last night my brain even played a trick on me, it said that I should make my last cigarette be with her, since she's a good friend... o.O But here I am, still smoke-free!

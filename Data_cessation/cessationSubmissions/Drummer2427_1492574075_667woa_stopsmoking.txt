Wanna quit, but starting a new lifestyle and not sure if I should stair step or plunge in?

I'm a 29 yr old male that's smoked at least since I was 15.. Quitting sounds exciting and even more scary. 

The big 30 is coming up and I decided its time to change everything, no more tobacco, get physically fit beyond anything I've ever really wanted and change careers.

Soon I will be changing all my food, hitting my usual workouts harder and probably triple them. 

I'm motivated completely. I'm disgusted with tobacco. (Oh how I love it though)
Here's my question.. 

Do I need to allow my physical improvements to start so that it will be easier to cope with quitting or do I quit first and then start my food and workout changes. 

All of my adult life and much of childhood tobacco of some form has been in my life.

I don't want to set myself up for failure so advice encouraged. 

Any questions welcomed. Thank you for your replies.  

Primarily am a smoker but dip occasionally, debated on using dip as a " come off" of smokes. But don't want to give my self too much of an out and hit smokes again.

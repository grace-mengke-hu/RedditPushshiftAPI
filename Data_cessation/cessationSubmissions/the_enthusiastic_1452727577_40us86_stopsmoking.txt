Completed first 5 days few minutes back. One question though.

Hello Non-Smokers,

I completed my first 5 days as a non smoker few minutes back. Feels good. Just 1 question. I have been feeling some discomfort at the back of my throat. Kind of transparent cough which used to be there when I used to smoke but it's sharper and worse now. Is it natural as part of physical withdrawal from Nicotine? How long does it last? And can I do anything to make this go fast?

Thanks all for your support.

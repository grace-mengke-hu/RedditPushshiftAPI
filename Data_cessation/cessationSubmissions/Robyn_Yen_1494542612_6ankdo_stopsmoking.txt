Hard day

 I'm 18 days smoke free and today was by far the hardest. I really craved. I'm in bed now ready to sleep and you know what? I am so fucking proud of myself. I could have easily just "had one". But it's never "just one" is it? No, we all know that! 
 My message is it's never just one guys! One day or day one? It's our decision. I've come too far to go back now! I'm surviving on the low mg gum alone and might switch to a vape pen, what does everyone think of vaping? I only want to use it until I'm on the lowest dosage of everything.

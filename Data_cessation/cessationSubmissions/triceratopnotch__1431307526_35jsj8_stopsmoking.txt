Off the Wagon

First post, because I was hoping just proximity to this subreddit would inspire.

Reset twice in in as many weeks, making it to 6-7 days each time before giving in. In the first instance I was drinking at a social event and I have no idea what non-smokers do with their hands at those things, so of course I reached for the first smoke offered to me. More recently I just hit a week and bought a pack for no reason except that I wanted to smoke and there really wasn't any self control left in the tank.

How do you guys grapple with self-discipline? I clearly have none. I hit that moment of genuinely wanting to quit again within a day or so of picking it up again, but I'll be damned if I can keep the motivation for longer than a few days at a time.

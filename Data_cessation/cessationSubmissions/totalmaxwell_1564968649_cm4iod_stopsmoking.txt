I need a better mindset

What up guys, I’m 18 y/o and fucking hate it but I have been juuling/vaping for over a year now and have been basically trying to quit for 10 months. I have failed so many times and I swear it’s because of my mindset, I always make up excuses like well I’m going to need a juul for a party/concert, or I need to vape so I’m not grumpy with my parents. I decided I was going to quit yesterday and I made it 24 hours until I hit a friends juul and ended up going to buy a disposable. Does anyone have some tips, the thought of me being addicted makes me depressed and I really want to kick the addiction before college( which I know is going to be so hard :(( ). Thanks in advance guys, and if someone wants to be quit buddies where we have to rely on each other I would totally be down.

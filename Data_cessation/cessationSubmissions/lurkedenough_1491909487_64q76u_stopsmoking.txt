The big 1000!

It's somewhat of a coincidence that I saw my flair today. Turns out it's been a nice rounded 1000 days since I became a nonsmoker. And I don't miss or crave it which I thought would not be the case. 

I just want to let those who are trying and failing know that it is not hard once you are determined to do it. (I also used champix for the first several weeks which helped a lot but still, having the will is the key part). 

To those that are struggling with it, I hope my and other stopsmoking community members' success can help your motivation and determination with this journey that seems hard at first. To those that are on it, keep up the good work!

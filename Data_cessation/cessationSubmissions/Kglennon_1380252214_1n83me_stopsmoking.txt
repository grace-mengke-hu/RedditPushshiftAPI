Day 5.... This time it feels different!

I have tried quitting so many times and usually caved at 2 wks, longest was a month. I know it's early but this time I feeling really good about it and have approached quitting differently. Firstly I found this (free) stop smoking app which is giving me visual help so I can see the health and monetary benefits, also shows you how many cigarettes you HAVEN'T smoked (app actually brought me to this site!), secondly coupling quitting with training/exercise  is really helping me as I can feel the benefits so much more, even feels like the positive effects of quitting are sped up with exercise. Lastly I've been concentrating on trying to visualize what goes into my body and how it effects it. For example trying to gt a mental image of the little hairs in your lungs burning away if I smoke again. Just wanted to post because you never know some of these ideas might help you just like some of your posts have helped and are helping me! Peace and love! X (apps called "smoke free" btw)

Almost 3 days

Tonight will mark day 3 (flair probably wrong but I'm on mobile right now). I have had some trouble breathing today. My nose feels swelled up, not much air passing through there. Also mouth sores are developing, accompanied by phlegm. I've had those 2 symptoms before but no trouble breathing. Is this common?

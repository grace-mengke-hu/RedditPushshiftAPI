Here we go again...

I managed to quit for 57 days. After that I started again over something stupid and had an on again, off again relationship with cigarettes. Then a friend of mine chose to kill himself and well... I think we all know and understand how that shit goes.

So last night a good friend and I decided that last night was gonna be the night for us once again. That the time had now come to quit the crutch and realize that it never really helps much. It's time to be free once again.

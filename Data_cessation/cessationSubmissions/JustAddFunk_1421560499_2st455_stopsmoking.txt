22 and not down to smoke anymore.

Hey guys. Canadian here...

Just wanted to share my story as I like this subreddit and I just found it.

I used to way 310lbs in high school. Lost most of the weight going into college and throughout. Worked my way down to usually anywhere between 190lbs - 180lbs depending on when I last saw a scale. I have been at this point in my life for a couple years now, I am now 22.

When I started loosing the weight I began a social life and therefore I slowly picked up smoking. I have been smoking for 5 years now and I finally quit. I think smoking along with the lifestyle I have been living have stopped me from reaching my true potential. Not saying I am upset with myself but I know I am lacking in health when it comes to cardio as well as being happy in body and mind.

So here is to quitting and taking on change. I am feeling excited to see what happens this time! I have also started doing yoga again :)

PS. also I hate people being smug and so I hate nonsmoking smug fuckers and if I am smoking I cant join them and in the health argument I cant beat them. So I am going to become a non smoking smug asshole :)

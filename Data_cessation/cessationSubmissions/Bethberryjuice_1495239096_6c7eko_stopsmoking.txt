Kinda freaking out. Need to quit and desperate for support.

Brief bio:  31, single mom of two.  I work full time and I'm a full time college student. I've been smoking for about 13 years now, with a couple of pregnancy breaks.

Today on my drive to pick up my younger son, I found a weird, painless blister on my gums.  When I first noticed it, it was white almost like a pimple.  Now, it appears to have popped? Sorry, TMI, but it looks different now.  Flatter, not white.  It is painless. I have had some gum and dental issues over the last few years.

I was instantly terrified.  That thing that has been lurking in the back of my mind for so long was suddenly unavoidable:  cancer.

Obviously, I need to go to the dentist and I'm going to.  But...I have the rest of the weekend now to worry about it.

I have to stop.  It is nothing less than stupid to keep doing this in spite of the very real and very serious health risks.  My kids need me.  I don't want them to have to lose me or see me suffer some horrible illness.

I'm not a super heavy smoker, but I'm definitely addicted.  I've tried to stop over and over this year.  I'll do well for three days, maybe four, then I cave.  I struggle the most at home in the evening.  I have some patches, but I'm definitely looking for some additional recommendations.

I really need support.  I hate how powerless I feel to stop doing this and I'm mad at myself for doing it in the first place.

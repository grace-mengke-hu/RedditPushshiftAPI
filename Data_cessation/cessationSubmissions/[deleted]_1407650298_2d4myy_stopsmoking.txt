It happened. All, take heed.

10 weeks and 3 days. 73 days. I didn't think I'd give in. I thought I had it all figured out. But, that urge took over tonight, I went down on one knee, and lit one up. It was as though I never quit. Good news: It was disgusting. And I am appalled at myself. Good news: I still consider myself a non smoker. Let me not do this again. This drug. It's a heavy one. Goodness help us. Much love to you all.

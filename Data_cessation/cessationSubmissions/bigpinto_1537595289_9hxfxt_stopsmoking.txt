Its been almost an year since I have quit, yet I still sometimes wonder whether I will start smoking again. Today, I found a couple of videos on "Addition" that seem to answer a lot of questions for me.

Basically, it says that your brain will always remember the addition. You can over time beat the addition, but the brain will always remember addition in some small way and hence one must always be careful not to relapse even though it does become easier and easier to not smoke.

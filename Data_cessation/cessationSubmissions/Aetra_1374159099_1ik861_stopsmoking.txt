And here we go... 2.0 kinda

OK, so I posted here earlier about how I plan to quit using gum and a nicotine free e-cigarette, but it turns out I can't use the gum, patches or lozenges. I've tired a few different brands of patches in the past, but I'm allergic to the adhesive (red welt after 10 mins that burns and itches for a week) and I tried a low dose lozenge just to see what it tasted like, but it made me sick for days. The 2mg gum made me feel just as sick. Not just uncomfortable tummy or nauseous, I actually threw up my dinner and had to keep rushing to the bathroom just to gag and bringing up bile. My husband was getting ready to take me to the hospital he was so worried about me. I want to quit, but I also like to keep food down so I'm not even gonna bother trying to adjust to gum or lozenges.

I've made an appointment to see my doctor tomorrow to get Champix (Chantix in the US). I figure go hard or go home, right? My husband tried it last year and it worked like a charm, but stress from losing his job drove him back to cigarettes a few months later and we can't afford for him to go on it again (Government subsidized for first attempt so it only costs AU$30. Any attempts after that you have to pay full price, which is over AU$300 and we just can't afford that.)

Wish me luck (again!)

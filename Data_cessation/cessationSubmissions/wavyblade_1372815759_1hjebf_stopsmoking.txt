WOW! the one week bounce really hit hard.....

if you guys aren't familiar with it, around the one week mark into quitting many people get an up-tick of cravings and withdrawal symptoms etc... and boy did it hit me hard.  I thought I was hitting cruise mode since my first few days weren't too bad at all (thanks Allen Carr) yet my resolve was tested several times today!   be wary, don't drop your guard!

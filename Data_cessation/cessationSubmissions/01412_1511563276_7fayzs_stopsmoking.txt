I really want to quit smoking.. but I still need help!

I read Allen Carr book, The Easy Way, I have tried hypnosis sessions, nicotine replacements and app called "QuitGenius".. but still I cannot throw away the last cigarette.. I totally understand how disgusting this "habit" is and everything, but non of that helps me to STOP... any suggestions redditors?

Nanna to 13

I quit smoking on 8-1-2019 didnâ€™t know about this site until I joined smoke free today ! I really need support to remain smoke free .in the  smoke free app I was asked to list things that helped me with cravings today , I chew a piece of gum after eating , I keep lifesavers candy in my pocket for when I drive , I have always played candy crush and this really helps ! Iâ€™m excited to see my grandchildren grow up ðŸ˜€

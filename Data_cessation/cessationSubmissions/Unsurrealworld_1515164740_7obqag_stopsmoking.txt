Adderall and smoking

I know this topic comes up every now and again on this sub. I've used adderall occasionally for the entire 14 years I was a smoker. This drug can be very useful if used properly and has benefited me greatly in my lifetime which I can't say for almost any other substance that I've used or abused in the past. I find myself using adderall maybe once every few months when I'm in a pinch at work or need to get a lot of housework done. 

For some reason, smokers tend to smoke a lot more while using adderall and the two go hand-in-hand almost worse than alcohol. It's a huge trigger. I'm on day 23 of cold turkey and I'm using adderall today for the 2nd time during my Allen Carr-inspired quit. I'm just posting here for accountability and because I really believe it's not as bad as I kept thinking it would be. The effects of adderall are actually not diminished by not smoking while on the drug. I actually feel pretty good right now and have been able to focus intensely on some very complicated work that I'm getting done. I keep going back to my memory of smoking while on adderall, but the way smoking would make me feel was just the memory of how it would relieve my withdrawal symptoms of which I am no longer experiencing. Smoking now would feel awful and I will not let myself be tricked into thinking I would feel better. if I smoked. The memory is bullshit! It's a trap and I'm not getting duped again!

Good day quitters.

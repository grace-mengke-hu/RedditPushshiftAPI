Living with a 40+ year smoker who HAS to stop. Any advice?

She's in her 60's, and she's smoked over half her life. In the last week, she's been in the hospital for smoking related illness, and we have to cut her off. She just got back from hospital visit number two and she's been amicable enough so far when I've told her no. I have a pack hidden, just in case, and I've stood my ground the few times she's asked for a cigarette.

Just looking for advice. Never really been in this situation before.

Willpower growing and feeling happy

This is the first time i have ever made it this far to 5 days - i know this is not a long time but for me this is the best achievement i have done. Not only am i doing this for myself but also my son who is 3 and unfortunatley has bad health which is getting worse he has a disease called raynaulds and also arthritus in his hands, jaw, knees and feet and is quickly spreading and also to his chest and eye sockets, so my main reason is to pack up this habit to get him to disney paris whereas before my way of dealing with my sons issues was to smoke now it is to see his face when he sees all of his favourite characters and i will get him there!

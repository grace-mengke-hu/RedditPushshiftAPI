Disappointed

In an honest attempt to quit, I had my 'last' cigarette Friday at 9 pm. I'm taking wellbutrin to help me quit. I didn't smoke all weekend. My husband either didn't notice, or wouldn't say anything about me not smoking. Our marriage is strained, but that's another topic. I know I shouldn't count on outside assurance, but I'm really disappointed that he said not one word about it. I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt that he simply didn't notice, but that's one of the issues in our marriage, that I feel ignored/Unconsidered. 

After I dropped my daughter off at school today, I buckled and bought a pack. I've smoked 2 so far today but I don't feel any better. In fact, I feel even more disappointed. My mouth tastes gross and my coat smells again.

I'm afraid if I throw this pack out, that I'll be fishing through the garbage to find them and have another. I guess I need accountability to get through the first month. 

Thanks for reading.

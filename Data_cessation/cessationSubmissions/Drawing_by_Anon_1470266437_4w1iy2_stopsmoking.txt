Three weeks, y'all - In your FACE, cigarettes and Big Tobacco!

I've been a smoker for about 20 years. In all that time this is the longest I've been without a cigarette. It's certainly the longest I've been without nicotine since I always used patches or gum each time I tried to quit. This time was cold turkey, the Allen Carr method. I'm happy to say I've been surprisingly okay.

The Easy: My withdrawal symptoms weren't intense this time. I was very optimistic and energetic right away. My mind has been in the right place too (unlike previous quits) and I've managed to stay mostly positive during the difficult moments. I never catch myself saying, “Boy, I wish I had a cigarette right now,” because I know lighting up would only make me feel ill. Zero nicotine for this long means I'd get that lightheaded, perspiring, nauseous feeling we all had when we smoked for the very first time. So there's that but honestly, I just don't want to. No. Hell no!

The Hard: I don't want to smoke a cigarette but I still have cravings and hunger pains for *something* that's no longer there; this stupid voice in my head that likes to whisper, “forgetting something?” Mornings are the hardest. Sometimes I feel empty and depressed. Then I get anxious because I don't know what to do about it. I can feel that I'm chemically imbalanced. I'm drinking more than I usually would (not thrilled about that). Regardless, it's getting better with each day.

Three weeks was a goal I looked forward to since the beginning. It's I milestone I've heard brought up time and time again, either from friends, books or in this sub. I felt that if I made it this far I would be able to stay smoke free for good. Now that I'm here, yeah, I got this.

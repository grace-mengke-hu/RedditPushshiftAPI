Quitting smoking with anxiety/panic disorder.

First post so any help or advice would be great. I got sick a few years back from mold in my house. Smoker for about 12 yrs now. Before getting sick never had anxiety, worked out and played sports 5 days a week. Since getting sick its been a rough 4 yrs. My body deteriorated, cant work out because of muscle weakness and panic attacks, when i exercise it causes my heart rate to increase its an immediate trigger for an attack. My testosterone levels dropped extremely low which i am treating. I have been working on my mental and physical health non-stop since but smoking is the one thing I haven't been able to do yet. Long story short with my anxiety quitting is exceptionally hard. I spiral into severe panic attacks and have a hard time making it past a couple days. It's a vicious cycle because I know smoking can increase anxiety but quitting does as well. I want to quit so bad but I just keep failing and failing. I know in the Long run it would help tremendously for physical and mental health but I just  feel defeated. Again, any advice, encouragement etc would be very much appreciated.  I wish all of you the best in your journey to be free of this addiction!

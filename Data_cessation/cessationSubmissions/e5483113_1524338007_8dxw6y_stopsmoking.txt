13 days cold turkey but....

But I’m traveling and currently in the Philippines (Southeast Asia) right now AND you can purchase cigarettes per stick, 10’s or 20’s. A stick costs 9 cents! Yes 9 cents! And a whole pack is $2!!! The cravings are back and they’re bad! I’m gonna try my best to not smoke... I need all the self control I could get.

Powerlessness

I can't believe I've developed this stupid addiction. This would never have happened a year ago - I was far more motivated then to life in general. Now circumstances have changed (i.e. I started at university, a high-pressure top school) & I feel so alienated and lonely, with very little control over my life.  

I know that if I felt more powerful, it would be easy to quit. Its because I feel that nothing I do matters. I've been in situations like this before, and I've gotten out of them by taking small steps of progress, etc. But in this situation I can't do much outside of class, and classes are just not rewarding - in fact, completely demoralizing. So there is just nothing good in my life, or anything to look forward to, except smoking. I know it doesn't actually help but I can't really see myself getting through the year without it.

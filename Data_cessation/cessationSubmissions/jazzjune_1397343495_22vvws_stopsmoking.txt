Had a smoking dream (nightmare)

I've been having pretty weird and rather lucid dreams lately (and waking up a few times a night),  so I've been getting rather sleepy in the afternoons.  Today I was off work and decided to cat nap on my sofa.  I dreamed of smoking a cigarette and I didn't remember I had quit until I was down to the filter.  I was like OH HOLY FUCK WHAT HAVE I DONE!? And I woke up.  I thought I had actually smoked, so I started to cry like a sissy and search through my pockets for evidence. 

There was none.   I'm just nuts apparently. 

Shew!

I quit ... again.

I smoked a cigarette a few minutes ago, and I have 16 left in the pack.

I found a growth in my throat the other day that scared the hell out of me.  My doctor says it is nothing to worry about, but I'm going to use it to my advantage.

I tried to quit a while back and I made it a few months.  I screwed up and bought myself a cigar as a "treat." Now I am at the bottom of the slippery slope, smoking a pack a day again.

I don't want to die from cancer.  I want to live to see my children have children.  I would like to be a grandfather before I die.

The universe is giving me a big push to quit.  From the growth in my throat, to the John Oliver Tobacco video, to learning about (and subscribing to) this sub.

So I'm doing it.  I quit, again.

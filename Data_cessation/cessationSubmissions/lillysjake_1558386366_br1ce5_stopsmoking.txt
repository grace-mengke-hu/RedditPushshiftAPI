6 months smoke free AND ran a half marathon (thirteen point freaking one miles)!!

After nearly 35 years of smoking I finally quit six months ago and started running. Used a Couch Potato to 5K training app and went for it! Did several 5ks and took a giant leap to train for a half marathon (yeah only 1/2 crazy)! Ran the 1/2 marathon yesterday with an official time of 3:03:46! Not bad for a new runner and former smoker! I feel great! If I can do it, trust me, you can too! 

My next step is to work on improving my 5K time! 

Good luck to you if youâ€™re trying to quit! You can do this! 

Thank you to everyone who supports this group as you all certainly helped me!

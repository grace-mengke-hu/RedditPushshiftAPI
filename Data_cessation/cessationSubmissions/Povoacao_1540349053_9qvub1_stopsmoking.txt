I know I can do it.

I fucking love smoking!

I can relax with a cigarette.  It feels good and takes off the pressure.  (I think?)

I work a normal 40+ hour work week.  Monday through Friday and I don't even think about smoking while I'm at work.  At all.  To be clear, I go to work everyday and do not smoke at all or even think about it.

However, as soon as my day is done and I punch out, I get in my car to go home and the feeling to light up is immense.  I must have it.  I earned it.  I worked a whole stress-filled day full of bullshit.

The pack is sitting there and I immediately spark up a smoke.  I take the first drag and it's so satisfying.  I take another pull and then exhale.  A couple of moments later I feel my body relax as the nicotine kicks in.  It's a short-lived high but it feels so good.  I take another pull.

I exhale and cough a bit.  Then I cough again.  The cig is not even halfway finished but I start into a coughing fit.

Mentally I push that aside because the cig is not done yet. I have to finish it right? (it costs money)

I don't care about smell,or health, or money.  I need the satisfaction. Is that what it is?  The satisfaction?  I can't understand it.  I just keep doing it.  Why?

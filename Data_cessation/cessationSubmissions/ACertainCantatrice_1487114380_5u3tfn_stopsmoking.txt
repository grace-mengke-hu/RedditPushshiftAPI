Posting to stay quit.

It's valentines day. My husband died in October and have been crying on and off all day. I keep thinking I just want to smoke. But I should not. And I will not. Posting this to stay accountable, I'm fighting hard for my quit right now. Three little kids need their mommy to be sane and healthy. We are going to make it through the day, reddit.

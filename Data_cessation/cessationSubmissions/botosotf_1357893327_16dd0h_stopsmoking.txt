It's part of the process!

I was smoke free for many months. I relapsed while on vacation for a few weeks. I did not enjoy a single cigarette. I was bound and enslaved to the nicotine the entire time and was FAR too conscious of it. Meaning, I couldn't even enjoy a guilt drag. It was awful.

YOU can DO it! Even if you relapse, let it continue to reenforce the fact that it is not who you are, it is something in your past! You've got it! You're worth it!

I have been smoke free for months since and it has only validated all the work I've done to be free of smoke.

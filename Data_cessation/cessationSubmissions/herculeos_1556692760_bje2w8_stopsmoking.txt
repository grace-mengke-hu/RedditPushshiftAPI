10 days!

My last daily post, not smoking is the norm now and I feel like I can take continue doing this indefinitely. I look forward to experiencing how my body continues to heal. Will do lots of exercise as well, which is good for my endurance as well. Will do a triathlon at the end of this month, and a climbing weekend in 2.5 weeks, so those are some good moments to notice and appreciate how my body has healed.

I think it will take at least a year until my endurance levels are hardly affected by the smoking, but that's ok, that means that it's just a matter of time and probably the largest part of the healing will happen in the first months. I have read stories of people winning marathons after quitting smoking, so I am optimistic about what is still possible for me. I feel no need to win competitions, but I want to be really fast and strong, and I am happy that that's possible now.

To everyone reading this, I wish you all the best on your own journey of quitting smoking. Keep on trying until you succeed, it is all worth it!

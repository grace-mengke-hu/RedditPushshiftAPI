Dreams and dry mouth

Hey reddit! Sorry for the formatting, im on mobile. I haven't had a cigarette in almost a month, but I have a dream involving smoking almost every night. Last time I quit, I didnt have these. And I didn't have them when I actually smoked. Usually in the dream I know I've quit but I don't care and have a cigarette anyway. Not sure why I'm having these dreams as I don't have cravings during the day. Does anyone know? Is it just my brain being crazy? This leads me into my next point. After I have these dreams, I wake up with my mouth tasting and feeling like I just had a cigarette. I couldn't have smoked in my sleep or done it in the middle of the night and forgot since I don't have any in the house. Could that just be my body getting rid of all the toxins? 

Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for taking the time to read! ðŸ˜Š

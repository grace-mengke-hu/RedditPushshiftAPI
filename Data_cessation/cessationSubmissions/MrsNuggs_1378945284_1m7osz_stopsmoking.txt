The dreaded "3 week craving" is setting in...

...but I'm not going to give in! I didn't give in this weekend when the husband was out of town and I had to take the oldest dog to the ER vet and I thought she was going to die, but she's okay after spending the whole weekend at the hospital. I didn't give in when I went back to work this week after being off for 3 weeks to recover from a FUCKING STROKE!!! I'm certainly not going to give in just because it's been three weeks and I'm "doing so well that I deserve a smoke". I'm not going to reward myself with death sticks. Tonight is tough, but I will get through it, I just needed to rant for a minute.

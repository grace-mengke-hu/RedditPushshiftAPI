Preparing for holiday ...and quitting

Iâ€™m taking a week off soon, and start to decrease my consumption (3 cigs a day). I will not smoke during the holidays and hope to stick on that after.
But I know that I can get anxious once back, and that makes me going back to bad habits. Any tips on managing that and stick to no smoking at work ?

Start stopping and stop starting.

I'll admit that I have a strange smoking problem. I work away on an oil rig and for the 3 weeks I'm here I don't smoke a single cigarette. There's only one small room to go to and its revolting. Also the smokers are in their twilight years and look utterly depressed and unhealthy. When I go home I drink a beer and buy a pouch of rolling tobacco. Then I smoke the whole time I'm at home. Eat sleep repeat. Apparently this is worse than just being a full time smoker. I have tried so many times to quit when I'm at home but as soon as I drink I cave in. Keep telling myself just the one bla bla bla. I managed to stop once but it was because I didn't drink. Any tips on a new strategy? I don't want to vape either to me that's not quitting. That's the weird thing I go through the cold turkey 7 times a year! It's shit. Just want to be free now. Any ideas please post. Cheers❤️

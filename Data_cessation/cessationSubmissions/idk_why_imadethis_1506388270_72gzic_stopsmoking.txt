Addict

It's been a few days since I've had my last cigarette. I've been craving one because of anxiety. I just found myself searching all of my bags and pockets like a crack addict, thinking I might actually find a cigarette or some tobacco somewhere. 

I didn't. And then I cleaned my vape pen and admitted defeat.

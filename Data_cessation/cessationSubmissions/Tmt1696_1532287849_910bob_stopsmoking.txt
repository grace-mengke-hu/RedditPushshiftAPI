One Week!!!

One week today. Was around many smokers yesterday and even had a few cocktails - absolutely no desire.  I’m just done.  I’m so amazed it has been easier than I thought.  Maybe the tries before led up to this time simply knowing I do not want to be a smoker, it’s poison and it won’t control me one second longer.  Easy Way helped but it’s really just about me and how I simply don’t want to smoke.

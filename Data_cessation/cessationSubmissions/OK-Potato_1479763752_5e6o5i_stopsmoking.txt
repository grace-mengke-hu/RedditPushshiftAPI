3 hours in :-)

Hello
After starting to hack up all sorts even to the point of waking myself up in my sleep i decided today was the day to quit. I bought myself some patches last week and so far they are helping to take the edge off. Tomorrow will be a challenge as i'm back to work so i figured i would join a subreddit for some extra support. Thank you for reading :-)

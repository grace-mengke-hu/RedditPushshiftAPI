I asked my dad what he wanted for his 50th birthday, he said all he wanted is for me to quit smoking.

Any advise? What worked for you guys? I need motivation and encouragement, I've tried cold turkey (lasted 2 weeks), I've tried EASYWAY (lasted 1 day) and I've tried vaping (hated it, didn't work at all) as none have been successful it would be easy to say I haven't *really* tried, so what do I need to do to get into the right mentality? I always used to think I'd quit if and when I have kids, but I don't want to wait until then, I want to be done with it and be healthier now, I'm 23YO, female and been smoking (properly) since I was 18. I smoke about 10-20 a day. If I'm in a situation where I can't smoke I dont, and it doesn't tend to bother me and I don't think about it, but as soon as I know I can smoke again, I light up straight away. My family, my close friends and my boyfriend are all non-smokers. I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions and am happy to answer any questions if I missed anything.

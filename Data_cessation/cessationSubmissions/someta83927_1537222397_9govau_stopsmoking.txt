I feel worse after 7 days!

OK, to be fair i'm still not a non-smoker.

I used to smoke 10-15 cigs a day, and for the past 7 days have been down to 1/day average -- there were a couple nights I was drinking and had a couple smokes. And the odd one here and there. A few days with 0 smokes

I'm reading Allen Carr right now and looking forward to completely cutting off when i finish the book

I'm surprised that, especially the past couple days, I have felt physically worse than usual! Tight chest, acid reflux, nausea, fatigue, rough throat. I don't have a cough, but I can tell my lungs aren't quite right

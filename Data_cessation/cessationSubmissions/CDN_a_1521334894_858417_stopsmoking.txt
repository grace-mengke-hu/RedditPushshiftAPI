I NEED to stop... relapsed... how can I get my motivation?

Any help appreciated. I have this problem where it takes me months to give quitting a try and then I quickly fail and then there are months and months again! I really want to stop... but just am finding it difficult to actually .. you know stop.. try again.. like for the 50th time. Thanks.

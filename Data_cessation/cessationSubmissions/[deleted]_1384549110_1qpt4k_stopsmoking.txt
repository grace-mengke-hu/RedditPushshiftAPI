I feel so close to caving...

This week has gone incredibly well.  I dealt with all the withdrawal symptoms that were thrown at me as they came, and I hit the one week mark for the first time since I started trying to quit months ago.

But I some potentially scary news in terms of me and my SO's finances, and I'm really having a hard time fighting my current craving on top of it.  You guys are such an amazing community, and the reason I created a reddit account.  Talk me down?

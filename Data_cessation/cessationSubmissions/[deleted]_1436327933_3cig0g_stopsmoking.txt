I want a healthier lifestyle, so I'll start with this

Decided about a week ago that I really want to start living healthier. I'm going to slowly add in yoga, meditation, and cooking for myself (getting off a lot of social media as well). Today I had my last cigarette. Washed the stench out of my hair, brushed my teeth for at least 5 minutes (not to mention in the past couple of days I've noticed what seems like gingivitis. yikes.). When I craved one I would walk, or do a quick sketch. I'm 20, I've been smoking since I was 16. The longest I quit was 6 months after a bout of nicotine poisoning. In the past 4 months I've tried to quit 5 times and failed every time. I want this so bad. I've tried to quit so many times I know exactly how this first month will go...I never make it past the first month (besides that one time). This one is different though. This time I'm not an ex-smoker, I'm a non-smoker. I can say no, not this one time. Because it's never 'one-time.' I can breathe and relax. Today I left work and I saw a half-smoked cigarette on the ground and immediately wanted to finish it off...and then I thought, 'why the fuck would I do that? I don't smoke cigarettes.' Hoping the next few days (and my biggest downfall - weeks 3-4) will be as easy but I know they won't. Someone on this sub made a really excellent point - life is shitty, but when you smoke cigarettes, it's shitty and then you have like a gazillion other ridiculous problems (paraphrased). It's just unnecessary. I'll keep that in mind each time, along with the beautiful, simple 'fuck no.'

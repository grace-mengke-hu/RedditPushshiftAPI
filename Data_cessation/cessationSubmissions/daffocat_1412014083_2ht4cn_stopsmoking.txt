Day 10. Does it get easier?

I am on day 10. I want to stay stopped as I can't afford to smoke, my children hate me smoking and my teeth are going to drop out if I carry on smoking. I am struggling a bit though. Previous attempts to stop have seen me giving in at about this point. Does it get easier?

HELP NEEDED supporting SO who is using Chantix

My SO started Chantix, last cigarette was two days ago. He is a very happy, level-headed, kind individual; however, he’s been unreasonably irritable and says he feels angry/depressed. 

While I understand that he is experiencing withdrawals from nicotine, as well as the side effects from whatever the hell is in Chantix, I’m wondering what I can do for him. Also, how long does this last and is it normal for Chantix to make people feel this way? I am all for being supportive of him. We’ve been close friends for over 18 years and he’s helped me through a lot of mental health issues, but when he is directing his irritability towards me, in a snarky, angry way, it’s hard not to want to snap back. HELP BEFORE I THROW A PACK AT HIM (/s)

Time to get serious

All right, reddit, I'm really doing it this time.  Last night I smoked my last cigarette.  

To make a long and depressing story short and sweet, I quit for about four months last summer, started cheating about once or twice a month from about October to January, and ever since then it's gotten up to about four or five times a month.  That's not acceptable.  I'm starting to encounter the 3-day hump again whenever I go 3 days without smoking.  

Really the only thing that causes me to smoke is when i drink, which I REALLY like to do but am also trying to cut down on (but let's focus on one addiction at a time . . . ).  I hope to be posting here frequently as I go through this process again.  

Thanks in advance for all your support!

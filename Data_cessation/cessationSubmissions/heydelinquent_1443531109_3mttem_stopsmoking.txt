Smoke for almost ten years, someone here scared me into actually making a legitimate effort. 3 Days smoke free and so far, so good.

I've basically smoked for the last nine+ years or so, with random breaks in between, but not many. Sometimes I'd smoke a pack a day, sometimes a pack a week, but in the last few months it has gotten very regular, and heavy, with a lot of drinking over the summer, and stress from moving to a new city.

I planned to quit when I moved, but when I did, found myself smoking more than ever due to stress/depression/lack of job/lack of car. 

Every day I was waking up hacking, had a constant cough/phlegm, my lungs and throat actually ached and hurt in the mornings and til the afternoon, my lung capacity was a joke, and I was becoming really paranoid I might be seriously sick with something.

Someone made a post here about 5 days ago about finding out that their 22 year old sister has lung cancer. Twenty TWO. Unless this girl has been smoking since she was 12, I have a lot more years of this disgusting, killing habit under my belt. 

Well, needless to say, it scared the shit out of me, and I quit the next day. I'm on Day Four now, and so far no crazy cravings, and my mood swings are far less worse than they have been in the past.

I'm determined to quit. I have enough health problems as it is, I don't know why I'm voluntarily adding more to it, and wasting all my money away in the process.

Ugh.

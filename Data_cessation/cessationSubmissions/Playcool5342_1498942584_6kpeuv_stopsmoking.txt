90 days cold turkey. Slipped today. I know I can do this, but it's a total mind warp.

I haven't drank or did any drugs(excluding nicotine of course) in 9 years. I convinced myself that I "needed some sort of vice", so naturally i caved and bought a pack. I smoked one and unfortunately I enjoyed it. I KNOW that's just the disease of addiction tricking me, but the nicotine is powerful. I know i'll regret it, and want to quit again. I know that I was pretty happy the first couple of months of freedom, but then the past month I got really depressed or something. I plan on quitting right away again. Best of luck to all of you, and myself.

72 Hours in

Hey Guys! 

72 Hrs into this quit, I've noticed that I'm really bloated and have A LOT of gas, horrid gas. Sorry to be so blunt but has anyone else experienced this with their quit? 

Also, I feel this time I'm quitting for sure this time I have really had bad cravings or irritability just what I mentioned above.

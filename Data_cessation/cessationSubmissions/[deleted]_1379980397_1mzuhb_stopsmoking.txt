I'm filled with doubt at my ability to quit at the moment.

Over the last 48 hours I have had two cigarettes down from 12 a day. I'm pretty happy about that but I'm finding it really hard. I've had tow packs of normal gum in that time. I'm wearing 25hr patches, and getting the most freaky vivid dreams. I'm finding it hard to concentrate as well.

I quite for five years last time and stupidly picked it back up about six months ago during a tough time. Sine that first smoke about 6 months ago i was instantly addicted again and it felt like I never stopped. 

At home I can distract myself so I don't think about it. At work though there is only one other person who doesn't smoke out of about 20.  

My best friend smokes and I really, really love smoking but i know how bad it is. The future health complications are the only reason I'm stopping. I miss it so so much and I'm going crazy! I don't remember it being this hard to stop last time.

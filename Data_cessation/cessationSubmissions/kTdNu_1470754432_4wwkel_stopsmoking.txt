Got the flu, quit smoking after. How can I get the phlegm out of my lungs and throat?

I recently got the flu and quit smoking once it cleared up. I haven't smoked a cigarette since the 6th of August and my flu has been long gone, yet I still have so much phlegm in my lungs that makes me cough when I laugh or breathe in too deeply. I try to cough some up in the shower every now and then but it usually doesn't make a big difference. Also when I cough up the phlegm I feel like I can taste little hints of cigarette... Very frustrating. What would help speed up the process of ridding my lungs of phlegm? Why do I still have phlegm in my lungs to begin with???

672 days!

Decided to check my quit smoking app on my smartphone and saw that I am 672 days without a single puff! I remember writing my one year quit post, which was 10 MONTHS ago. Time flies by so fucking fast. I don't think about smoking, or quitting smoking, EVER. Cravings long subsided, after a few months into my quit. It's all smooth sailing here. I am so happy I quit smoking at a young age (quit at 23, I am 25 now). Cigarettes get increasingly more expensive in my country, so all the euros I've saved I spend on better things instead of giving myself lung cancer. I tried to quit numerous times before, but they never really sticked. The last time it did, though because I did a few things differently.

- I removed ALL triggers from my life during the first few months. My main trigger was hanging out with my smoking friends and going out to bars and such. I'd always cave, saying I 'deserved' a cigarette because I quit for a few days already. So during the first few months I didn't see my smoking buddies a lot and it made all the difference. Once you're a few months into your quit, you solidify your resolve and put more time between the present and your last cigarette. It makes it easier to deny a cigarette once you're in a triggering environment. It's all a mental game.
- I experienced an internal shift. I realised that I actually never wanted to quit. This might sound a little bit silly but hear me out. You are always making choices based on avoiding pain and experiencing pleasure, right? So that cigarette you crave falls somewhere on that equation. For me, the pain of continuing smoking was greater than the perceived pleasure of smoking a cigarette. Smoking does not do anything for you. There are only downsides. You are literally burning your money away. You are destroying your health with every cigarette you smoke. You leave people at the dinner table because you have to smoke, AGAIN. You are wheezing and coughing after a night out because you managed to smoke a pack or two during a NIGHT. You smell like shit. Your fingers have that unhealthy yellowish tint to them. The problem is that you and I know all the downsides and risk already and somehow we don't really care when we're still smoking. Thats because you believe with your conscious mind that smoking is bad, but your conditioned subconscious mind still believes that smoking is still in some way benefitting you. You have to undo that conditioning. What helped me tremendously is The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Alan Carr. You probably have heard of this book already or maybe you've already read it. But it deals perfectly with all the conditioning in your subconscious mind by challenging the beliefs you have around smoking. I highly suggest you get a copy and read it through the first time. Then, after you notice you get cravings again, read parts of the book that deal with that specific situation. Keep challenging those beliefs until your conscious and subconscious mind are aligned. 
- Replace the bad smoking habit with something healthy and productive. Anytime you  feel that craving do a few push ups. Or just go outside and get a breath of fresh air. Anything thats easily done and something you can do anywhere. It's just an itch you have to scratch, but you can choose what to scratch it with. Choose something different than smoking a cigarette.  

I highly encourage you to keep going at it. Ditch the cancer sticks, even if you failed 100 times. Maybe the 101st time will be your lucky charm, but keeping at it is key. It IS possible to lead a life without cigarettes or thinking about cigarettes. Numerous people on here  can testify to that, all you got to do is not giving up! You can do this!

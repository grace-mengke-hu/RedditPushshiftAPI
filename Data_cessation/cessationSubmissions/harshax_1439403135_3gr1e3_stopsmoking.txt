Six Months smoke free and counting

Been a while since I've posted here, but I just wanted to let everybody know that I'm still smoke free. Next month, I'll turn 45. I smoked about a pack a day for 25 years and this is the longest quit I've ever had. It will be my last quit too.

I get a craving every now and again, but its less the siren's call and more like hearing someone else's phone ring. It took about a month to get over the psychological withdrawal, the fear, the paranoia and just strange brain/body aches. I've been averaging 30 minutes of decent cardio 3-5 days a week and I've managed to maintain, if not lose a little weight along the way.

So, if you think you can't do it. If you think you're too old. If you think it's too late. You're wrong. You might have made it harder for yourself, but you can do it. Just take it from a guy who broke the habit after smoking for more than half his life.

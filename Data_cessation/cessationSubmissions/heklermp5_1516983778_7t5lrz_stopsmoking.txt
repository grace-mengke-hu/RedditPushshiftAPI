Clear phlegm with brown spots

Not smoking for almost 8 days now.
But 24 hours after my last cigarette, I noticed that I sometimes cough up clear/sometimes green phlegm with brown spots in it.
I have been smoking heavily for 4 years (1-2 packs a day), and I am 20 years old.


Absolutely no chest pain, 
no difficulty breathing, 
not feeling breathless, 
no coughing (except when I want to spit phlegm out), 
no headache,
no appetite loss,
actually gained some weight,
nothing is wrong but this brown thing.

Doctor checked my lungs and said that they sound perfect and he thinks that I dont need an X-Ray. 


Should I be worried? 
Is this normal?
Thanks!

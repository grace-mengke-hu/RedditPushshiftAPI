New town, new job, so I smoke

22 years old. Graduated college in May, got an internship in a town across the state. Internship got extended, full time could be on the horizon. Co workers are great, but no friends to speak of in new town. Smoking for 2 ish years, several attempts to quit, a vaping period I'm not proud of. Idk, guess I just smoke for something to do. At the same time, I'd like to quit sooner rather than later...

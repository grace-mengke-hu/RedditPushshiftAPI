Really strange...

Doing pretty well so far, my sense of smell and taste are definitely getting better which is nice. But what kinda sucks is I can once again smell that cigarette smell you don't notice when you're a smoker, my flat mate also smokes and I can smell it so strongly, what's even weirder is that I find it sickening. Anybody else find this as well?

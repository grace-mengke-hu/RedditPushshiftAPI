Hanging on by a thread.

Yesterday was actually quite easy, but today, not so much. I'm trying to be mindful of my environment to pinpoint what exactly is causing me to feel this way today. Work's been kinda hectic today, but it was hectic yesterday too, and I was fine. 

I've been looking at my addiction objectively, and I realize that it impacted me in so many other unhealthy ways. When I smoked, I also practiced intemperance with other things: alcohol, food, laziness in general. It was as though subconsciously through smoking, I didn't care about myself, so I allowed myself to not take care of my health in every other way too. Does that make sense?

Today, the thread I'm hanging onto is my desire to NEVER go back to being like that. I know as soon as I introduce the cigs back into the picture, everything else will go to hell too. I just hate this empty feeling inside.

Does your cardio instantly improve after quitting smoking?

Five days ago, I went on a light jog with some friends and I could not keep up whatsoever. I had to keep stopping, and it was by no means extraneous. I was absolutely baffled at how out of shape I was. I lift weights at the gym and I'm not fat. At the end of the run, I took out my pack of cigs and threw them away. I haven't smoked since. I'm going on another jog in a couple days. Will I notice an improvement in my performance? Are the cigs solely responsible for how hard the run was? Because not only could I just not catch my breath, but legs were sore. Maybe it's just a general fitness thing?

Day 18... Anxiety has me down

I can't say I'm not an anxious person... But wow.  About 3 days ago I'd say it started but then it hit me full force.  I've already gone through the anger, I've got some latent depression I suppose, but dealing with this anxiety is brutal.  It's like a ball of adrenaline in my chest, and I'm trying to distract myself and exercise as much as possible, but it's like I can't come down.  It'll get better than the adrenaline part after a couple of hours, but it feels like an all day event.  Anyone else get really bad anxiety?  It even got to the point at one point where I rushed out of a store because of it.  Haven't done that since I was a kid.  

On another note, anyone else have thyroid issues before or after?  Just curious.

Thank you so much for this sub, it's been helping a lot.

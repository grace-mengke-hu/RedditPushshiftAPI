63 DAYS SMOKE FREE Prostate cancer non existent

Just hit 63 days of I DONâ€™T SMOKE. Diagnosed with Prostate cancer 2 Years ago, after Prostate removal and then 10 weeks of radiation treatment I ad my hopefully PSA test done. 1 year ago score .021, this weeks results was .012. My Dr. informed me I will die one day but not from Prostate cancer. After being smoke free along with exercises my energy level and outlook HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. LIFE IS FUCKING GREAT How do you attach photos

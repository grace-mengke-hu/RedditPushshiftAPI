You can seriously do it, do not give up, just push through and do it.

I gave up smoking after I smoked so many one week I literally fucked my throat so bad. I HAD to give up. My friends never thought that I, out of anyone, would give up smoking but I did and 296 days later I've never felt better in my life. I don't even think about smoking now, although I still enjoy the smell of a freshly lit one. I'm sorting my life out one step at a time, and giving up smoking has helped so much, I feel better, smell better, look better, best decision I have ever made. There is no way I will ever smoke again, it only takes that one filthy cigarette to trigger it all again.  So I say to you, do NOT give in, keep pushing through, you can do it, you can FUCKING DO IT, trust me. Good luck.

Trying to quit, stress keeps hindering my progress, advice on how to handle stress while not smoking?

I have been smoking for the last 2 and half years. I started because when I was at work I constantly got stressed and used cigarrettes to help cope with stress. Eventually it carried into my everyday life and I smoked while at home or when I was out. I smoke about half a pack a day. I know I should quit, my father and his father both died from smoking related illnesses and I don't want to end up like that.

I have tried to quit a couple of times but after a few hours (longest I went was about 20 hours.) I would relapse and go for a cig due to stress. I currently own my own business and have an injured back so I have a lot of daily stress. In the interest of full disclosure I do smoke weed (once or twice an evening), but I don't like to do so during the day when I have stuff to do, it makes me think slower and less functional. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to de-stress without having to turn to cigarrettes? Unfortunately none of my friends have successfully quit cigarrettes so I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, any help would be very much appreciated.

12 years a smoker &amp; 5 years a vaper. Day 30 of being a non-smoker &amp; non-vaper. Please help, I am still craving nicotine !

Hello everybody, this is the first time I am posting on reddit, and I do so out of sheer desperation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to get some advice from fellow ex-vapers/ex-smokers in order to motivate me to keep this attempt to quit going. Just so that you guys can learn a little about my addiction, I have smoked and vaped simultaneously. The vaping had decreased the number of cigarettes I smoked from 40 per day to 20 per day, but this came as a doubled edged blade as my puff count was around 800-1000 per day which entailed the consumption of 15-20 ml per day. I would day that vaping/smoking simultaneously has costed me around 200 US dollars a month, which I consider a lot of money but this did not bother me.

Favourite brand (s) of cigarettes - Stuyvesant blue, Dunhill switch and Marlboro beyond blue

Current vape device - Zues dual RTA with Asmodus Lustro 200W + Drop RDA with Smoant Charon Mini 225W

Favourite Juice- Nasty juice (Trap Queen) and Blueberry Jam monster

This is attempt number 10 000 to quit smoking as far as I know (you tend to lose count of the number of attempts eventually), and each time I have quit and started again then the following attempt becomes even more difficult. I must admit, on this "final" attempt to quit, I have cheated with the assistance of Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking audiotapes. His power of suggestion into freeing the mind of the brainwashing that smoking has caused, is truly enlightening.

Anyway, the crux of my problem is that I KNOW cigarettes are bad for your health due to the tar...carcinogens...cancer...blah blah blah! These are powerful reasons to stop smoking. HOWEVER, vaping is described as this completely healthy and "magical-unicorn" alternative to smoking. With something that is described to have no ill side effects and is being advertised to be so cool and sophisticated (example - JUUL), how am I able to quit vaping? 

&amp;#x200B;

I must admit...I see myself as a drug addict. That feeling I get when I was down to my last cigarette or the feeling I get when my bottle of ejuice finished and I had none left. I hate smoking and vaping, and I wish to be FREE OF THIS ADDICTION.

After 30 days, I find that I do not crave the cigarette but I crave VAPING. What do I do ???

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

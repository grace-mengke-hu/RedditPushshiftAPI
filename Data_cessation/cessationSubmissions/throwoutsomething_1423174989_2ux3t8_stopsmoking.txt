Quitting while battling depression

Hi, throwaway here.

I've regretted smoking ever since i started (like most of you I assume) - I haven't been smoking long - id say about 7-8 or so months; but my problem is, I have been battling depression on and off for a much longer time now. There are a lot of reasons why my mood is generally in this up and down swing, but the gist of it is, I am not generally happy, I feel quite lonely often and the only outlets I could really get in life to make me feel accepted or happy were to go drinking with friends which led to smoking. this became a problem when I realized I was smoking about 6-10 a day, so I started trying to quit; I know that doesn't sound like a lot to some of the people here, but I am only 20 so it feels like I am setting the rest of my life to fail if I don't stop now.

my most recent attempt faulted when i had a downswing of emotion which led me to fuck up and feel worse inside. I have friends who used to smoke and when they quit, they didn't seem to have any problems with it; when I bring up the topic of quitting with them, they just brush it off as a - you will be fine, don't worry about it, its not as bad as it seems; which just makes me feel more secluded and unable to talk to anyone. It just makes me feel shitty because if they can do it - why cant I?

I just need advice from someone who has been there, knows what I mean. Did any of you manage to quit smoking while battling depression? I know that if I can just get over this hump and quit without relapsing, I will feel so much better emotionally, I just need advice on what else I can do to help keep myself on the home straight.

Sorry if this isn't a fantastic bit of writing, I am mostly venting when I write this because I just need to release.

Thank you for reading.

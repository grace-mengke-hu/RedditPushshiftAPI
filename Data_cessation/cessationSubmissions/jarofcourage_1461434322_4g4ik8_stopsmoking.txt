help! am now dating a smoker! eek?

Advice needed. I am a happy non-smoker, 4.5 months free. This has been a hugely successful quit, where I put my ALL into it. After 15 years smoking there is NO WAY I will risk backtracking. The last month has been easy - I was so proud to hit the 3 months anniversary. But now I have been spending a lot more time with my new guy (who I am really  into), but he smokes (2 pack a week). I also think the relationship is going to get serious fast. 

He smokes less when he is around me, and he is not going to compromise my success... but, being intimate with him I find myself attracted to the subtle smell. (I must have told him how good he smelled 3 times in one night. That's when I started wondering... was I craving the nicotine?)

Am tips? Suggestions? Ideas? For the short term  and the long?

BTW loved celebrating Earth Day by NOT throwing stinky butts on the ground!

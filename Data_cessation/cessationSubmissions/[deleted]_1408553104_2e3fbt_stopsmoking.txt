Mother's Day was 100 days ago. This was the best gift I could ever give Mom and myself.

My mom was my inspiration to take the plunge into non-smokerdom, and dedicating my efforts to her has been a source of strength in my moments of weakness.  I know she's proud of me, and I'm proud of myself.  Love you, Mom.

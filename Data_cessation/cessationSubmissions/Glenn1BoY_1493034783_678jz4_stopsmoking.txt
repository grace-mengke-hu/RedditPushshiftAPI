Feel like crying, beating someone.. Really a roller-coaster

So, I'm currently home by myself and this is getting to me.. I've smoked for 4 years and stopped Saturday but my mood is fucked.. I'm angry, sad, motivated, a bit sick, tired etc.

Just needed to let it out, anybody know how long these moodswings can last, because I'm feeling a little helplessness at this this moment, and I don't know how many weeks of this I can go..

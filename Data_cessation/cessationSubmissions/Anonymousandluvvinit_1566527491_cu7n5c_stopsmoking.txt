Only been 4 hours and Iâ€™m starting to feel it...

Smoked 6 months, switched to vaping a week ago as a supposed transition. But HOLY SHIT, yeah it seems healthier but I suck on it all day and am consuming twice as much nicotine, further addicting myself and worsening the upcoming withdraw. 

Anyway today is my intended quit day. I feel a little antsy, hard to focus, and some other odd feelings.

Advice for someone trying to quit?

I've been a smoker for 7 years, and I'm trying to quit. I smoked my last cigarette on 26th November. I tried quitting in June of this year, but it didn't work out. This time I'm much more determined, and I want to make this one count! 

It's my wedding anniversary resolution :) 

I'm using nicotine patches and lozenges to help me subdue the craving. 

Any advice?

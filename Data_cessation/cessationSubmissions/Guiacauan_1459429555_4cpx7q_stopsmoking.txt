Five days.

Hello Guys, 

I've been smoking since i was 14, i'm 25 now, about 30 cig's a day. It's been five days since i quit smoking, i was not aiming for this, i've  buyed some dumbbells and some weights to stop being a lazy fuck. And buyed a book to learn how to exercise and diet properly... "Bigger, Leaner, Stronger by Michael Matthews"...

I've started reading the book at thursday 24, its  423 pages long, and the book have a section about willpower, explaining dopamine, and some cool strategies to make you workout everyday and dont sabotage your own goals...

The first thing,(for me its working, it might sound like bullshit) is called "I Will, I Want, I Wont: How to become your own master"

Putting it simple:

I Will: To have the power of doing things you want to do, like waking up 6am to workout, study more, be more present at home, stop smoking, stop bingeing.

I Wont: To have the power of don't do thing you dont want for yourself, stop drinking heavily, stop smoking heavily. Being capable of denying yourself something familiar and seductive like that afterlunch cig...

I Want: The real things you want for yourself in the future, a job, your health, a certain type of look.. anything...

There's a lot more, but the base for me was this... it's been five days and every craving i fell i try to remember what i want.. I really want to stop and be healthier... so.. its good reading for everybody.

I've downloaded an app too, called "Smoke free" to track the time, cigs and money.. cool stuff, it has an achievment system that is pretty inspiring (I'm a gamer, i don't resist to achievments).



Well then... sorry for the poor english, i'm brazillian and learned english watching series and movies, maybe i have expressed myself wrongfully along the way.

Five days and counting.

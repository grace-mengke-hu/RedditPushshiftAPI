I'm 11 days smoke free and I'm finally just grasping how bad I was.

I've been eating voraciously for the past couple of days and today it finally clicked in my head. For the last decade, any time I felt hungry, thirsty, full, anxious, sad, or otherwise "not good" my initial response was go have a cigarette, and see if that fixes it. 

I had built this automatic response of first trying a smoke and then attempting otherwise, I am still trying to redefine my response to negative stimulus and the quick reaction of going for a smoke still pops into my head from time to time. But I know that is rarely the solution. 

If you're reading this, try to better learn what you want rather than applying a bandaid to all cravings of anything.

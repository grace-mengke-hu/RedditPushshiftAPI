stopped smoking 120 days ago - but still "falls" sometimes. [23F]

Hey everyone,

So I've been a smoker for 9 years - and i've finally stopped since more than three months now.   
The thing is - I really don't feel like I need it everyday. Even when I get a craving in my day-to-day routine, it's quite easy to resist it. But almost everytime I get drunk, I smoke. Not a lot (it's usually mix with weed), but still.  And with summer, holidays, parcs,... it's really hard to resist the party vibe. 

I see others posters talking about "NotAnotherPuff", or ppl telling that they had one cigarette and started smoking all over again. I really don't feel that's the case for me -  because even if I smoke a bit one night, I keep on quitting the next day.  
But the addiction does stay stronger that it should be after 120 days of being totally smoke-free.  


What are your thoughts about it ?  


On one hand, the habits job has been made - i've made a whole new routine without smoke.  I really feel I am much less dependant, and I do not want to start again. On the other hand, it's like I'm waiting - or craving- for the times I go out with my friend so I can smoke a tiny little bit. So it might be the addiction messing with me.  


Thank you and keep on the good job :D

Quitting for hopefully the last time

I've been an on /off smoker for about 6 years. I was at about a pack a day in 2012 when I was in the Navy. Been home for a while and have picked up and put down the smoking many times. I was able to quit for 4 months the beginning of this year. 

Since April it's been a constant struggle to stay off them. The depression I've had for years is finally being treated. Being properly medicated is definitely starting to help. Been cold turkey for 3 days going into 4 now. Feeling pretty good so far and I'm hoping to stay off them for good this time.

Smoke Free for 14 Years!

I used to smoke back in the 90's when I was in my mid-teens. I became hooked into the hype of smoking to be cool among my friends like many others did.

It wasn't until several years after I started smoking, in late 2004, that I finally quit. I had tried multiple times in the past, using gum, cold turkey etc. but nothing lasted long, and I had maintained my habit of up to a pack a day until 2004.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, using a combination of hypnosis and a few changes to my daily routine, I quit for the last time. I have been a non-smoker now for 14 years, and I have no cravings, no desire to smoke at all, all of the activities or situations that used to trigger my smoking habit haven't been a problem, and I feel so much healthier now.

Back when I used to smoke, I was having a hard time breathing, running for short distances was tough, I often found myself having a sore throat, chesty coughs, and other issues.

&amp;#x200B;

But now, I feel amazing, I can breathe deeply, do extensive physical exercise (currently training in Shotokan karate), no throat issues, no chesty cough, and I don't get tempted when around others who smoke.

I started my own Hypnotherapy business back in 2014, specializing in smoking cessation so that I could help other people with this [very effective method for quitting smoking](https://www.IUsedtoSmoke.com).

Day 7

Smoker for years. Something clicked and I just became over it. With the help of an amazing vape and will power, I haven't even had a drag of a smoke in a week and I can already notice drastic improvements. 

I would smoke a pack a day, Marlboro Black 100's, those are on the scale of one of the harshest cigs to smoke. 

Every morning when id wake up, I'd have coughing episodes to the point of throwing up. It's just a nasty habit. I got sick of it. 

Noticeably I do not have those coughing episodes anymore. I'll still cough here and there but nothing crazy. It seems to calm down more and more as the days go by. I have more energy, my appetite is better, I feel I'm getting more out of each breath I take. Sense of smell and taste are higher than it was. 

Overall I'm just feeling much better and I'm excited for it to only improve. 

But the best part is Im starting not even to crave cigarettes anymore so it's literally getting easier as the days go by. 

I'm so proud that I was able to get this far. It really boosts my moral

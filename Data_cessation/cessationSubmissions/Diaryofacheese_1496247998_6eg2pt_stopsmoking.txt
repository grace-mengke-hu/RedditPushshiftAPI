Bend, don't break.

I haven't smoked cigarettes with regularity since 2014. Three years. I started vaping then, and realized about 10 months ago that I was doing it more, and more, and more. All the time. So I decided to patch it. I've been wearing patches for the better part of the last year. And then just  3 weeks ago, for no reason i can identify, I bought a pack of butts, and well, we all know what happened there.
 I quit, cold turkey 8 days ago. It was "easier" for me during the physical withdrawal period. The last three days have been a slow and steady decline into clinical depression, the other demon chasing me ( I have long since wondered what the relationship between nicotine and depression is).
So I put a patch on this morning, and am feeling doubly hopeless; this is the nature of my disease, and I also feel condemned to have a relationship with nicotine for the rest of my life because I can't seem to adapt to any turbulence within the sea of brain chemicals in my skull. Does anyone here have any insight?

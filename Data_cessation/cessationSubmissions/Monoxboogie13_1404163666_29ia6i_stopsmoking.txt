I am at the mercy of the beast and need help

I am a thirty one year old who has smoked or chewed for over fifteen years. I realized a few years ago I was addicted. I don't get any pleasure from it anymore. Yet I think of nothing else until I satisfy the craving then I feel awful when I give in. There is part of me that desperately wants to quit and another part that feels like I can't go without it. I have sometimes gone a day or two but then I go right back to it. I'm wondering who else has felt this and what you did to get your mind to change. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

I am not quitting because I have found what makes me happy in life, I am quitting to help me become happy in life.

So, I smoked my last cigarette on Monday before I went into work, which puts me just a little behind 48 hours in, and I am really not feeling bad. I meant to post on Monday but just read a bunch of posts instead, but now I would just like to reiterate my own thoughts on quitting here.

So, I have been struggling with depression for a long time. Sometimes it's tolerable, sometimes it's crippling, but one thing holds the same, and that is I use smoking as an outlet for depression relief. I always wanted to quit, but I always gave myself the classic *I will do it when I am happier* excuse. *Once I get a cool job, once I find the right girl, once I blah blah blah*. Fuck that. Quitting smoking will make me happy and all other life accomplishments will come easier after I rid myself of the demon. No more feeling tired in the morning because I smoke too much, no more being out of breath from a single flight of stairs. I'm cutting out smoking and replacing it with grabbing life by the balls and doing the things that make me happy. I will wait around for something to happen no more, and make things happen for myself. I am 23 years old, this is no way to live the rest of my life, so here we go.

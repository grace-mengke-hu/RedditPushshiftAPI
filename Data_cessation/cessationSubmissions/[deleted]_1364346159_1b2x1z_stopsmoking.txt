Just ripped up half a pack. Wish me luck!

I'm 19. I started smoking when I was about 15. I've quit plenty of times. I actually successfully managed to quit last time and then over spring break fell into the "well just one won't hurt" trap.

I was thinking to myself "Fuck Mark, you really need to stop this shit while you're still young." I walked to the store to buy some headphones and smoked a cigarette on the way there and another on the way back. I had psyched myself up and when I got to my building I whipped out the pack ripped them all in half and chucked them before I could talk myself out of it. (On the way home I started thinking "you can just finish this pack and then stop". FUCK THAT! 

There's a girl I'm interested in and I know she doesn't like smoke/smoking. I need to get back in shape. I need to go shower right now. I need to shave. I need to do my homework. I need to study. I need to grow the fuck up. Maybe this is the start of something wonderful and new?

Any help or advice would be appreciated. Doesn't have to be just about quitting. Life and relationship advice is cool too. I really just want to talk and keep my mind off walking to the gas station 3 blocks away and grabbing some more deathsticks.

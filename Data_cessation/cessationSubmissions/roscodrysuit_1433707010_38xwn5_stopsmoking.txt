I haven't bought a pack in almost 5 days, but I can't stop bumming off people.

I live with my mom who smokes and I keep bumming them off of her. The most I've smoked in a day since I stopped buying packs was 3, but I want to completely quit. Any advice or tips to stop sneaking them or asking my mom for one?

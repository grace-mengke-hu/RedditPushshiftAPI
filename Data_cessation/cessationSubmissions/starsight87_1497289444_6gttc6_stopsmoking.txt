Day 38- Its time to quit drinking too

This last month has been a bit of an eye opener to me about the things that I want out of life and the barriers that stand in my way. First and foremost I want to be a healthier person that doesn't rely on substances to level out my mood. Second, I want to save up for activities that make me feel good about myself and keep me active.

Already I have seen the benefits of quitting smoking for my bank account, and my lungs. I've restarted are running program and it gets better all the time. However, alcohol remains one of the real expenses in my life that has also caused me to gain weight. These days I feel like I can do anything and that I want nothing to stop me from progressing. 

For this reason I will be dropping drinking as well. I don't know how these next few days will be, maybe there will not be any noticeable change at all. However, I am excited for what I can do with the extra cash, the reduction of calories and a summer free of drinking. 

Thanks everyone and best of luck today.

was almost going to take a drag but when i smelled the cigarette smoke combined with the taste of residual vomit in my mouth, i threw it away.

went to a couple of parties couldnt get out of and resisted the urge to smoke successfully for the most parti got thoroughly drunk. vomited and had to bow down to the porcelain god,

a friend handed me a cigarette, tried to light it, almost gonna take a drag but when i started tasting the smoke mixed in with the taste of vomit in my mouth, i just threw the cigarette away and proceeded to look for a glass of water.

i dont think i enjoy/could put up with the taste of a cigarette anymore, i hope this means im one step closer to quitting

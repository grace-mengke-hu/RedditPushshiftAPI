Any advice for those of us like me with an oral fixation on quitting smoking?

I have tried the patch, the gum and E-Cigs.  None have been able to work.  I've been smoking for about 8 years now, and the longest I've been without smoking has been 4 days.  It seems like it's just not going to happen.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I am really trying to quit smoking and have something to be proud of!

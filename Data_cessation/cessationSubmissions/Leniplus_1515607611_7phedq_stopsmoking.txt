2 Weeks without ciggies! :]

I've been a heavy smoker for the last 7 years. I promised myself when I hit 21 ( which I did 2 weeks ago) that I would stop smoking. And so I did , haven't touched a ciggaret in 2 weeks all tho it is hard can't deny it. 

But I feel better about myself without them, I feel like I can start taking better care about my body. 

There isn't any tip that I can give you that would actually be of help , it's kinda all about personality for me breaking a promise is something I can't get over so that helps me and pushes me to stay away from them. 

Best of luck to all of you fellow guys/girls that are trying to quit. Cheers

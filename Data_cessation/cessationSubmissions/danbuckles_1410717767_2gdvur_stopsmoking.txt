Into the second week for the second time

I had quit once before a while back, and I was going strong for about a month. I gave away my cigarette injector, all my tubes, tobacco, etc., and bought an electronic cigarette. Everything was going great, and I felt great, until I got word that my brother died. I bought a few packs of cigarettes over the next few days, then bought a new injector the following week.

I was smoking again for probably two or three weeks due to this tragedy, until the opposite of a tragedy happened; I met a girl. As soon as she accepted my offer for lunch, I was done smoking. It's been a little over a week now, and I haven't even gotten the urge to smoke, even after having surgery the other night. I've been stuck on the couch bored out of my skull, but I still haven't filled a single cigarette tube.

Sure, I'm still on the ecig, but I'm on a lot lower of a nicotine content than I used to be, and I only use it at home, not even on breaks at work. I've only got a few milliliters of liquid left, and then I'll either just stop completely or pick up some 0% liquid.

Things are going better than ever before, and I have no doubts that I'll be able to keep this up. I just wanted to share this with you guys, because I feel great since I quit tobacco, and I hope you guys who are struggling can all find that thing that replaces the urges.

God bless.

I'm NOW addicted to Nicotine Mints (2MG). What are the health complications involved?

Long Story Short: I quit smoking over 4 years ago. I never smoked a lot, more of a social thing I did during college. I used the nicotine mints at the beginning to help out, and they worked great. 

Last summer, I got into the habit of purchasing these again. I'm probably consuming roughly 10-15 a day (2mg each). I haven't noticed any health issues, but I was curious if there are serious health risks involved with this habit? I have searched online, but the most I have found is that these mints have time frames of how long you should be taking them, but it doesn't talk about habitual use. 

Not sure if there is a better subreddit, any info would be appreciated. 

Thanks!

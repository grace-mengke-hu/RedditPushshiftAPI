I seriously wanna smash my head against the walls.

Day number one. Yeah, fuck that. Fuck everything in existence at this point. 

If it walks and breathes I wanna kill it slowly. 

Like fuck I'm so angry at everything and I don't know why. 

I've cried like 3 times within the last 20 minutes. I can't concentrate on school to save my life. I wanna go home but I know if I go home I *WILL* smoke.

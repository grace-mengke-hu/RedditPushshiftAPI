Third day, bad cravings.

Hello everyone! I never posted on this sub but I have been lurking. I'll introduce myself, quit-wise: I used to smoke 10 to 15 cigs a day, and then I quit. I went down to 1 cigarette a day, and zero for some time, but I was still smoking some tobacco because of my spliff (smoking marijuana with tobacco) daily habit.

This went on for a while, and eventually I started smoking cigarettes again. 1/day, then 2, then up to 4. However three days ago I made the decision of [quitting marijuana and tobacco altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6bk1pw/im_quitting_this_time_for_serious/)  
At first I thought marijuana would be the biggest issue - and it was, on day 1 and 2; but today, I really want to smoke a cigarette. My mind is like "yeeea you quit mary for good, a cigarette can't be all that bad" and as soon as I noticed the pattern I came here and posted this. Do you have any advice about this? Maybe quitting the two at the same time wasn't the best idea...

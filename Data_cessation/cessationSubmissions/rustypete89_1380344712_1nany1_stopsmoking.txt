7 days from one year, I'm removing my badge.

It would be a year next friday. My tobacco use these days isn't much, but it is steady. I put small amounts of rolling tobacco into joints. It's not much, but it adds up to about 2 cigarettes each night. It's been like this for a couple of months now. I kept telling myself that I would just smoke fewer, or stop at a certain point. But I haven't. I'm hoping to actually cut back by winter, but for right now I'm on the hook again. I'm taking resolve from the fact that I still don't find cigarettes on their own appealing and I don't find myself craving cigarettes or tobacco during the day at work. Several co-workers near my desk at work are smokers, and every time they come back from a break I get a pungent reminder of why I quit in the first place, so that helps.After I get home, it's a different story... but that's what I have to work on right now. And I'll get that badge back, for good this time.

Stay vigilant, my friends.

One week in and still going strong.

This isn't the first time I stopped, but it is the first time I really wanted to. And it is the first time I'm not going "I need a smoke why did I even quit I'll never make it long". I don't really feel any physical symptoms (neither bad nor good ones), and the only time I had a craving was yesterday when my co-worker annoyed the shit out of me. But smoking wouldn't have helped against that, and I didn't cave in. I'm a bit proud of myself.

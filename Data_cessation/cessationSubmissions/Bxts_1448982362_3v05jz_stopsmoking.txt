Please help, I've slipped down again.

Hello everybody, I have started smoking at my 24 yo, now I am 31 yo. I have tried for the second time this year on October, 20th and initially it felt great but some days later I stared to smoke one or two per day. I have learnt to manage all the triggers except one: my work. I am surgery resident with long shifts and almost all collegues smoking. I have smoked a pack last friday at work, smoked nothing on saturday and another pack on Sunday at work. I still dont smoke outside my hospital. I tried to watch easy way yesterday but the first I did today is to smoke a cigarrete at work. Is the anyway to reset mentally my "non-smoker" status?

What could i do to not smoke at work?
Any help is greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.

Not a smoker anymore

I don't know what my counter is but I didn't smoke a cigarette for over a month I think! Now I made 1000 attempts to quit and thought I would never get rid of this but finally I did thanks to a hypnosis on youtube. I smoked for about 9 years and hope my lungs recover from it quickly. So I'm pretty proud of myself and I'm unsubscribing from this sub now. Thanks and good bye.

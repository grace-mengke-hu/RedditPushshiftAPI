Just smoked my last cigarette

I've been reading Allen Carr's 'Only way to stop smoking permanently'. I have a few chapters left that I'll get through tonight and tomorrow morning but I've just finished my pack and I refuse to buy another one to see me through the final chapters. 

Although I stand by my assertion that the first 1/3 of that book was one of the worst things I've read in a long time  it got better and more focused. 

 I've prepared a visualisation of a chimera of everyone who has annoyed me over the past few years. I'm not nervous just very keen to start watching that little monster die over the coming weeks.

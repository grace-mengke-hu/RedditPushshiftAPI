Maybe it's the withdrawals speaking, butâ€¦

The biggest danger to my continued cigarette-free existence is smugness and dismissal. Whether it's from people who've never smoked ("Suck it up. How hard could it be?") or former smokers ("All you have to do is X and it's easy!"), these are my challenges.

Fuck! It's fucking hard! And those attitudes are the ones that are the closest to making me give up.

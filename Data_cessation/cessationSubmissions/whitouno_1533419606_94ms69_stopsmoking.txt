2 weeks update

 Well, it was very hard *phew*. A lot of things has changed. Taking my morning coffee w/o cigs feelt like something is missing. Being stressed and can't have a single puff? It was like heel. I ate a lot of candies in the first week so I gained 9pounds lol, but I'm not worried. I can lose this extra weight exercising with my better lungs. Thinking about that, maybe 9 pounds was good, bc I'm skinny.

 Sometimes i feel nostalgic, but I don't want to go back. I really want to be the good version of me, not the addict version that gets really angry when are in a place that cigarettes are not allowed. 

 This sub helped me a lot, not just because of the tips or positivity but because I would feel so embarrassed if I give up and have to remove my badge. Dumb reason, isn't? But it truly motivated me. Thanks for the help. Wish you all the best.

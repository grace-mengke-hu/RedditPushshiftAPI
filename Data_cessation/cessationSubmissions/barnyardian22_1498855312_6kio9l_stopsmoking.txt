Applying a nausea-inducing substance to cigarettes?

I would like to inject some sort of nausea-inducing substance (over-the-counter medicine, poor-tasting item that can be found in the kitchen, etc) into every cigarette I own using a syringe. The ultimate goal is to condition myself to associate nicotine and tobacco with nausea and make cigarettes less appealing. What are some nausea-inducing substances I could use?

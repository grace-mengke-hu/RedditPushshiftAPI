207 days

Hi /r/stopsmoking

I just came here seeing another post and i noticed... It's 207 day without smoking, cigarettes or nicotine.

Some facts about my quitting:

* I did quit cold turkey
* tried to confront smoking situations head-on instead of running from them.
* prior to quitting I smoked for 12 years about 1,5 pack a day
* yes, it was hellish non stop thinking about cigarettes and constantly thinking i won't make it while trying to convince myself i can
* I decided not to use any substitutes as nicotine was the thing i was addicted to. (Now i can see that clearly)
* It would be 307 but i was weak once. I decided i have to be honest with myself, reset the badge and don't give up.

Some facts about 207th day:

* Carvings are **less than once a month**. Once you'll learn to deal with them the hard way it gest easier later on.
* Smell is enhanced as f\*\*k. While this would defineatly be the up side, I have to say that **I now know how people smell and it's horrible**. While sitll, knowing how i smelt while walking next to some smoker gives me the chills. The smell is horrible!
* Taste is stronger but not noticably. Even so, you can defineatly cut down Soft drinks sugars and everything "strong"  as even something just a bit sweet you can tell

Overall I came to say this:

It is far **far FAR** more better than being a smoker. You don't feel bad. You don't wish you were a smoker back. You feel good. You can do it. I could and belive me i am not strong willed. 

If you think you cannot - you're wrong! You can!

If you just started thinking about quitting - Do it! It's awesome!

If you feel powerless remember - You can! Belive in yourself!

I am with you, we are all with you!

Stay happy my fellow non smokers.

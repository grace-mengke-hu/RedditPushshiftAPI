332 Cigarettes Not Smoked

Every time I consider giving in to a craving, I look at that statistic. Sure, maybe one would be nice (actually it would probably be pretty disgusting at this point, 25 days in) but it's never just one. It's one in an endless chain. It's kind of mind blowing to think about. Yeah, I kind of miss having one but I definitely don't miss having 332 and that's what addiction does to you. Not one more puff, no matter what. ðŸ’ª

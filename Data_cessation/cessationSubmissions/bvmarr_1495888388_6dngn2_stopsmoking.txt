Where to start

I'm currently 29 years old and have been smoking for about 10 years.  I want to quit and have wanted to quit for a while.  I can never seem to break the habit,  if I try and quit I end up buying some Copenhagen, like that's even a better option.  I always seem to need something and can't let it go.  Where do I start and how do I quit this damn habbit?  All advice is appreciated and needed.

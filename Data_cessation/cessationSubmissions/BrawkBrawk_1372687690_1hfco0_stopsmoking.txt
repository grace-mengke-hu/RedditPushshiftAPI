Quitting Today. Need to grow up and start living a healthier life.

I'm quitting today! This is my second attempt, but first time posting in this subreddit. Made it 4 weeks last time. 

I've smoked for 3 years and need to finally be done with it. I'm heading on a work/vacation by myself for 2 weeks and want to use this time to work through my addiction out of my environment and start my recovery. 

My family doesn't know that I smoke and I know that it would kill my siblings and parents to find out that I did. This habit is not a part of the healthy life I have made for myself and I don't want the label of "smoker" anymore. I eat clean, exercise everyday, and take care of my body but I can no longer say I am a healthy person until I finally kick this disgusting habit and be honest with myself.

Please wish me luck.

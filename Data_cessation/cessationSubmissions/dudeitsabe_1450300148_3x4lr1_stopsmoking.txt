Need to stop

Hey guys. Never thought I'd actually make a post here but maybe it'd be good to hear some voices of reason. 

I'm young, I'm not necessarily addicted yet, and a lot of my friends smoke while drinking or just socially. All of these factors have in some way contributed to me acquiring the bad habit. 

I'm getting to the point where I crave them. I figure I should nip it in the bud while I still can. 

Any advice on how to curb cravings?

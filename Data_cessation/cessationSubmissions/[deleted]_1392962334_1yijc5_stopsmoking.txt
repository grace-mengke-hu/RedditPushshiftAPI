Can I get a "negative" addiction to green tea?

Since I stopped drinking, smoking, coffee and fapping I kind of need a substitute. I found one with green tea. Since everybody says it's utterly healthy I started drinking it. And as with everything I started taking in higher amounts of it. So now I'm drinking a liter of green tea per day. Can this have any bad consequences? Or am I doing (finally) something good to my body?

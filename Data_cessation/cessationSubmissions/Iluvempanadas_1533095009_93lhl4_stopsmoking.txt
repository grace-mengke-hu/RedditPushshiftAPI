Ok, this is it! I’m quitting!!!

I’m a singer, I shouldn’t smoke! And I need to quit asap...so I’m doing it, right now I made up my mind!!! 

I just gave away a full pack of cigarettes that I just bought...as soon as I bought it I realize...

What the hell am I doing to my body? Most importantly WHY?!  I think I kind of hated myself...but I’m done...I need to end this addiction...

Any good tips?? 

Is there someone kind enough that I can write every time I feel like smoking again? 

I really need this, I need to stop...

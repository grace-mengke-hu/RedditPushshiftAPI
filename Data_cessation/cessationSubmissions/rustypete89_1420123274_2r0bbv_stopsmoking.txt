Achievement unlocked: 1 year tobacco-free!

I did it, guys! After failing 8 months into my first quit attempt and backsliding for a few months I came back more resolute than ever and earned that fucking gold star! Feels great!

To all those still under a year, you can do it too! See you on the other side!

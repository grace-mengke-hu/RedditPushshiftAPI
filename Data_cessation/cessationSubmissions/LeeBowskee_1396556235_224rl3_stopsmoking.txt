I quit in 1992

Hi Everyone,  Just wanted to stop by and let you know that you can quit smoking tobacco.  I did 7,848 days ago and I haven't had a single smoke since.  That means I haven't smoked about 236,000 cigs (1.5 packs / day)

Keep it up.  One craving at a time, eventually they run out, you can do it.

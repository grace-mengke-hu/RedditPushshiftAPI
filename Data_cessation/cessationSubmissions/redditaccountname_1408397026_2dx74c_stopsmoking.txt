Tips on social aspects of quitting?

Hi /r/stopsmoking I'm sort of new here...

I have quit (unsuccessfully) a number of times at this stage. The last time I quit I was off cigarettes for a year, the time before that, I was off for about 9 months. My question really revolves around how people have learned to deal with having people smoking around them in social scenarios and situations. The last time I quit, I spent a significant amount of money on a drug called Champix, which was amazing by the way, and have only recently started up again.

It starts as always - sporadically. I then find myself in social situations after a stressful week or day at work or in college, and say to myself "ahh one won't hurt". And one turns into two, and we're here all over again. I don't want to chastise or demand my friends also quit, but I'm increasingly concerned with my own insecurities. I'm living in a place currently where my housemate smokes, and I love the guy, but I fear I can't stop again, despite having been able to the last time, until stress got at me.

I consider myself an avid swimmer, but when I smoke, I can't do any respectable distance at all, I know this, yet I continue. On the verge of insanity now, so any help or supporting advice would be much appreciated! Thanks!

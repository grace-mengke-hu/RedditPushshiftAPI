Tired of failing

So I have been smoking for about 8 years. At one point I was a three pack a day smoker. I'm down to about half a pack a day and sometimes I'll only have like 5 or 6 in a day, but I'm tired of considering that a win. I want to stop completely. Anyone have any advice or have any experience with elimininating this false success? I'm also an avid pot smoker any advice on not having that post joint cigarette ( which is like the second best cigarette after eating ). **Didnt even make it half way through the day and have had 4. I keep justifying the reason to have a cigarettes. It weird its like I know what I need to do but my brain is totally overriding my authority**

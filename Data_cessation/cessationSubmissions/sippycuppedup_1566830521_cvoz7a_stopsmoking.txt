Threw my vape out this morning.

I'm 23. Had smoked cigarettes/tobacco off and on before getting my Suorin vape to quit smoking. Been vaping my suorin pretty much non-stop for the last 2 years and the stars were aligning telling me to quit that too. Gf has been trying to quit but says she can't quit if I don't. Parents sent me link to story about a teen who just died from vaping. This morning I said screw it and threw mine away. Biggest thing I'm worried about is stress eating to replace my addiction and gaining weight. The plan is to workout like crazy every day to be tired to care about nicotine/food. Any advice from those who have quit vaping?

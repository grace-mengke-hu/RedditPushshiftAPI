132 Days and still crave

I stopped smoking cold turkey about 4, almost 5 months ago. I still crave about 1 cigarette a day. I just miss it so much. I'm happier and healthier not smoking. I realize all of the benifits, and I'm definetly a much calmer of a person. But damn, I miss it like I'm missing an ex lol. Whyyyy?!

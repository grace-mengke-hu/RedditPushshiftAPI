Thinking of giving in after 57 days...

Hello fellow quitters,
57 days ago I quitted with Allen Carr and it was pretty easy for me.
Of course I thought of cigarrettes a lot within the two months, but I always reminded myself that I'm a proud ex-smoker now.
However, in the last days my brain tries to tell me that I loved the breaks in university with a cigarrette. 
I imagine how nice it would be to go out now, listen to my music and smoke a cigarrette.
I always think of my reasons why I stopped smoking and so on, but it seems like I get weaker day by day...
I hope someone of you is able to give me a little push to get back on track.
Smoking wouldn't fit in my lifestyle right now, I eat extremely healthy and do a lot of sports, but my brain just doesn't care even a little bit...

Thanks in advance :)

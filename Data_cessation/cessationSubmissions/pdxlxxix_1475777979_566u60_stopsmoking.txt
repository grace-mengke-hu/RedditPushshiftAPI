Day 5 married to a smoker

The thing I miss the most is my morning coffee and ciggy with the spouse before leaving for work. I didn't smoke at work, just in the morning with coffee and evening after work with a glass of wine. 

I've cut out alcohol and the bar for the month of October.  But the connection with my spouse is what I miss. That downtime after work has *been replaced with the gym and a puzzle on off days. But the mornings????   

*edit misspell. Thank you autocorrect.

It Begins..... Again

So, I haven't been here in a while - I'm not sure I've ever posted - though I thought I had, I can't find it any more.  That's not really relevant anyway.

Yesterday was the beginning of attempt #19,865,378 to quit smoking (or at least, it feels like I've tried that many times)

In the past, I have quit for anywhere from 1 month, to 3 years, but always go back to the cigarettes.

I'm using Varenicline (Champix) for the third time, because my other (somewhat) successful attempts were while using this amazing drug.  I'm not going to recommend it to anyone, because I have heard horror stories about the side effects, of which, luckily, I have none.

Anyway. This time is it. I am going to quit smoking. I have a plan, and even a few goals (one of which is to be able to run a non-stop 5k by Christmas).

I going to succeed this time. I'm going to try to be active here and keep you all posted.

I'm not smoking again. This time I mean it!

The Quote that has started this all, that I repeat many times a day....

I've been wanting to quit smoking for quite some time now. I am 32 year old who's smoke most of my adult life.  

What drives me nuts is not so much the health issues(as serious is that is) but the power the addiction has over me.  I claim to be very mentally strong but in the back of my head, I've always felt powerless from my control on tobacco.  

"Cigarettes will not satisfy the hunger, it will only create and extend it"

I read that in a comment a few days ago and it really hit home. I've read allan carr's book, (i'm not sure if thats from it) and I really enjoyed the read but for some reason this quote really did something for me... The last three days I've woken up and repeated this to myself when I'm in a position where I feel I want/need one.  

That one cigarette won't change anything, I'll still be High AS F from that joint, stressed from the work or my relationship, and my life surely will not be any better off taking those drags from the smoke. 

I want to take control back, and I'm excited to do it. 

Thank you for allowing me this platform to vent and to feed off the good energy.  I can't wait for the future without Ciggs.

E-cig nic surge...your experiences?

I'm not a pack-a-day guy, but have been off and on for about 20+ years, anywhere from four to ten cigs a day, occasionally more but very rarely a full pack. Sick of the smell, expense, and health risks, of course.

Just got ahold of some e-cigs and I'm surprised at how well I like them. I can't believe how much they feel like a real smoke (using Blu's). I know this has been discussed here many times, but I'm wondering if anyone using them has had this experience:

I smoke an e-cig for a two to three minutes (about the same time I would take to normally finish a normal smoke), and I feel an immense nic hit. These are "lights" mind you, not the full flavor. As I write this, I have a serious nic hit happening and it's been about 15 min since I smoked my e-cig. I'm even a little sweaty and shaky, which is something a normal cig hasn't done to me in ages. Feeling shaky triggers me to think I need a smoke, although I clearly do not. 

I guess I'm just looking for some feedback from those who know what I'm talking about and could advise. Should I just take 3 hits from the e-cig and resist more? Is there another option? I'm worried I'm upping my nicotine threshold with the e-cigs and that I'll eventually have one of these things strapped to my face until I have a coronary.

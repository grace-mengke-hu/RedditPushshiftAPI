Counting to End Date - Tips &amp; Advice is Welcomed

Last time i quit for 6 months but then relapsed when some friends came up to party... My method for quitting was effective though, i bought 2 cartons and told myself when they're done, so am I. 

The effect was good, it was like a constant timer in the background, i still got to smoke in the meantime but as that timer got closer and closer to 0 my mental preparation for the final cig became stronger and stronger. After the final cig I was prepared to let the habit go forever.

I decided to go with that method again. I bought 16 packs just now, which should last me about 2 weeks. I wanted to come here because i know im going to need help and support. 

I have my GF who's 100% in support of me and a few close friends, one of which who is a quitter. But I want as much support as possible so iv'e come to Reddit, i'll find Facebook groups too, I REALLY want to quit for good this time.
 
It's been 13 years now and i can feel it, im waking up sick, feeling lethargic and generally disgusting, cigs aren't even enjoyable anymore. My looks are fading as well, but ultimately health is my main reason to quit.

So Reddit, my questions to you are the following:

* How do you mentally battle those INTENSE cravings? They're the worst for me.
* What are some supplements you found to work to replace the habit? (gum, water, candy etc..)
* How about when you drink? I imagine that's going to be one of the biggest temptations for me. I drink once a week and smoke like a chimney whilst doing so. Any tips for holding off on smoking while drinking alcohol? 
* Anything i can tell my support structure to help them support me?
* Any other random advice you can give me to incorporate into my system to help strengthen me along the way?

Thanks in advance, i'm looking forward to hearing from you and more so looking forward to finally slaying this evil demon!

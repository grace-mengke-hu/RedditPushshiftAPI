I need some help with quitting

The majority of these posts are for cigarettes,  which I technically smoke. 

I'm addicted to the tobacco, I smoke out of a bong topped with mj. Essentially a spliff in a bong rip. I've tried just about everything except nicotine replacement simply because my goal is to break the addiction from it. I know that's what drives me to smoke them. I've tossed the bong twice and made it about a week before I lose my wits and go buy another cheap one and a fresh pack. 

It equates to about 3 cig a day. Only smoke me when I'm home in my apartment.  Leaving me tired and unmotivated. So I'll smoke another and another and another. I don't feel like I want them when I'm out doing something. ..but knowing it's waiting for me at home..idk. I'm just confused and tired of feeling like a piece of a hit because I'm hooked on this habit. I've even tries just smoking cigarettes but it doesn't give me the rush I'm looking for.

I know this is a unique circumstance but if anyone has done it or has any ideas. Please, I'm all ears. If I need to go to another sub, just point me in the right direction...

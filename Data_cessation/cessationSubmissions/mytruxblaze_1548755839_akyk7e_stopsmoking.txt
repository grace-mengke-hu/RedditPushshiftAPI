does vaping work ??

i want to quit so badly but my temper is off the charts , i really loose my shit

i think i could do it with vaping but something about the liquid nicotine grosses me out about vaping nicotine , i think its because i smoke so much weed and associate vaping with cannabis and nicotine in cannabis is disgusting

cannabis is pure and perfect and anything in my cannabis takes away from cannabis , my brain associates vaping with cannabis even tho i never vaped cannabis and only used bongs and bowls

its the fact vaping is liquid nicotine i want to throw up just thinking about it

something about vaping nicotine is absolutely disgusting to me , yet i smoke a pack a day of marlboros

i am about a month away from buying a vape for weed , and me and my wife have been talking and hopefully i can substitute weed for cigarettes and just vape my weed

i have never vaped weed before i always had bongs and bowls ,

but i need to quit , im 47 and been smoking since i was 13

but i am really scared because i loose my shit so badly , there have been times i have tried quitting before cold turkey and its a miracle i did not get arrested from loosing my shit on people , i turn into asshole times a thousand

i been looking at the airizor air 2 and a dynovap and a small bubber with water pipe attachments , hopefully vaping weed can get me off of cigarettes

i know for a fact i could quit with vaping nicotine but i can not get my brain around how gross liquid nicotine is ,. so as weird as it sounds i can not vape nicotine because it really grosses me out

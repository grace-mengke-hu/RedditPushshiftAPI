333 days

Tomorrow, I will hit the 333 smoke and weed clean days! It has been a rollercoaster with many ups and downs, but no matter what happened I always followed the golden rule: no voluntary inhalation of smoke, at any cost! Today, I can spend the whole day with smokers and not once feel the urge to lit one up myself. I am very proud of myself and I have saved myself like 3000 euros, maybe even more because I was also spending money on weed. I can absolutely assure, that stopping smoking is among the best choices I have made in my life, if not the best. Of course I had my failures before this streak, but I never gave up and continued fighting. Be strong, burn all the sigarets, throw away all lighters,   keep your smoker friends on a distance for a while and MOST important of all: keep yourself fucken busy, doesnt matter with what. The best would be doing sports. GOOD LUCK! Its the most rewarding thing ever!

This is getting embarrassing....

So i started smoking about 5 months ago. My ex smoked so I picked it up (stupidly). Well, I've been hitting the gym daily and my strength and size are coming on fast, but I still smoke! Where do I start? I've tried cutting down (I smoke about 8 cigarettes a day), but it doesnt work. I want to quit entirely.

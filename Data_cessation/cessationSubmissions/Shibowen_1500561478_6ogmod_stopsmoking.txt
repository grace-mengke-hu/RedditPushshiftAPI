"Actually, I don't want them."

Stopped at the gas station for a snack, not intending to get cigarettes.

At the cash register, asked for the American Spirit yellows (you know how it goes, you just let habit take over and stop yourself from really thinking about what you're doing), and after the woman rang it all up, I was able to say, "actually, I don't want them." Never once was able to pull out of a relapse at this point, and boy it was nice having the price immediately go from $11+ to $2 for just a honey bunny and an energy drink (shutup). 

So yeah, feel happy about that little win. I know I would have felt bad if I hadn't, and I'd still be working on that pack today. 

Hope I can still stay strong, leaving on a plane in a few hours for China for an extended stay over the summer and then a grad program in September. It's extra hard to quit smoking in China where you can buy and smoke super cheap cigarettes everywhere, and also these transitional periods always leave me falling back into the habit.

But yeah, I know I can do it if I try, like anyone. :)

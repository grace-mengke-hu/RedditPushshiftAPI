The Easy Way... Any Tips?

I'm about 2/3 the way through Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking after seeing it get insanely glowing reviews in a recent AskReddit thread (to see that many people on reddit admit they thought it was BS until it worked and they couldn't explain it convinced me... We're a skeptical bunch after all).

I'm really wanting to smoke my last cigarette now, not wait for the book, but I promised myself I'd do underwater basketweaving if the book told me to, and it specifically says to wait until you finish the book and don't "cut down" in the mean time.  I want my last cigarette... when I smoke it... to truly be my last.  I'm tired of this curse.

I made a great attempt to quit once a few years ago by smoking lobelia for the three weeks of the withdrawels.  I went 3 months without a cigarette until I used a random cigarette as an excuse to take a break at work during a stressful day and... well, you all know that trap I'm sure.  So I really want to know if anybody else has tried his method, what your thoughts are, and is there any advice to help augment it?

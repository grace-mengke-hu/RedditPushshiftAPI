Need advice.

hi all, 

i went from cigarettes to juul /occasional cigarettes to quitting cold turkey about a month ago. but the cravings still creep in and i really fear that i might just say fuck it and bum a cigarette or buy a pack.  

at this point i’m wondering if i should get on nicotine gum to ensure i don’t succumb to smoking another cigarette again and then i’m thinking i would be able to quit nicotine gum eventually too by swapping them with regular gum (replace the oral fixation) 

am i just looking for an excuse to get nicotine back in my system or is this a reasonable way to make sure i don’t regress into smoking a cig?

It’s only 5.5 days, but it’s the longest in 10 years.

I think I can finally confidently say I had my last cigarette. I’ve placed myself in situations I never thought I could get though and I did it. I sat by a campfire for 5 hours last night and didn’t have a single cigarette. I bought a nicotine-less vape today, which I know isn’t the best move, but it’s for tonight in case I need it because a smoker will be present, but I feel friggen great. I know most of you already know, but you all rock. Many of you are a true inspiration and proof that we can always gain our health and freedom back. Thank you!

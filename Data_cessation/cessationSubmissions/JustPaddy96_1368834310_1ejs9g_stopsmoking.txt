Hey.

Hi, never posted to this subreddit before, but all you need to know about me is I've been smoking for a year now and frankly I want to stop now (due to some personal reasons) I've tried before with little success but plan to use this as a method to help me as who better to turn to than those who have managed to quit themselves? Thank you for taking the time to read this, I play on doing fairly regular updates here (hopefully not to the point of annoyance) but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

How can I stop smoking at college?

I hardly ever smoke when I go home during holidays. I think its the fear of seeing my parents disappointed so I am able to not smoke for around 3 months. I find it easy. I probably get like a couple of cravings when I'm home but I don't usually follow them through.

But the moment I get to college the cravings get worse. I try to fight it by keeping busy with work etc but no matter how hard I try, it's at the back of my mind. I don't understand why I want a cigarette when I've been smoke free for 3 months...surely the nicotine has left my system by then. But I end up finding myself back to my 10-15 a day habit in a matter of a week. 

This happens all the time. I'm in my third year and I've quit countless of times. I'm just wondering how can I quit when I'm away from home and don't have the pressure of my parents finding out.

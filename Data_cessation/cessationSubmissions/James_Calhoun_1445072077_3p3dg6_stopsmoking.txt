Need help

Three days in. Currently at the office, collegue is going to get cigarettes at the gas station down the street... Really tearing myself apart here. Actually want to start running to the gas station and get cigarettes. I know I'll feel disappointed when I light up that 'relief' cigarette, but somehow I need some convincing not to smoke today.

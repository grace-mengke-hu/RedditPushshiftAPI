Tonight I quit.

I tried to quit a few months ago leading up to Christmas, just after university and work finished up. I lasted 26 days but slipped when a close friend of mine visited from the States. Anyway, he left last Friday, I had about half a 25g pouch left, and just finished the last cigarette I could muster from the dregs of it. It's 10:30 pm, I want to munch durries, but I'm stopping myself from going 200 meters up the road to the local servo to buy another pack. 

Hopefully this time will be my last quit attempt. I really want to stop, despite enjoying it so much (which I do recognize to be part of the self illusion and deception we tell ourselves when we smoke in order to keep smoking). I played basketball for my first string team last night and I can feel it affecting my game - I need to quit for health reasons, but also for moral reasons and the effect it has on my personal relationships. I'm sick of shambling off outside for a smoke every 40 mins when I'm kicking it with friends (a lot of my friends are smokers, but I'm talking about those who aren't). 

I have a question for you guys - the last time I quit I had a strange reaction. I couldn't get to sleep properly at night. My mind was so intense. Is this normal? I'm slightly worried about it and don't want to go through that again. 

Thanks for listening and thank you in advance for any support and advice. 

Peace and love from Australia!

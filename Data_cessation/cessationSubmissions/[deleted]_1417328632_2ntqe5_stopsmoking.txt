Three months today! And not a single puff.

To people on their first few days all I can say is it gets a lot better very quick :) hang in there, stay away from nicotine at all costs, and before you know it it'll have been days since you last vaguely thought about smoking. Good luck, and all my gratitude to everyone who shares their wonderful advice and support here. This sub has been invaluable.

P.S. Any advice for the months to come?

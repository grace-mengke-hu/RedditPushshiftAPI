Starting to think I should have taken some time off from work to do this.

Seriously, TGIF. I noticed that I've been fine at home, any cravings that come along I can shake off relatively easily; but, trying to work, especially during slower periods of the day, has been damn near unbearable.

I actually went to grab a pack on my lunch break today, but took a right into Target instead of a left to the gas station and picked up about $30 worth of snacks to chew on instead. Pretty proud of that.

Anyone care for a milky way, or some beef jerky?

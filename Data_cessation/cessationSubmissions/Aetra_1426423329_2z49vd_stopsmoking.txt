Nicotine gum + normal gum = yes or no?

I chew normal gum like nicotine gum is meant to be chewed (I know, I'm weird), so I'm curious if someone would be able to have 1 piece of nicotine gum and 1 piece of normal gum at the same time? I'd imagine the normal gum would offset the effectiveness of the nic gum so it wouldn't work.

I probably won't try nicotine gum after my uncle was an arsehole and gave me a piece as a "prank" when I was a kid anyway (sick. as. a. dog.), but it's just a question that popped into my head and I couldn't find an answer on Google.

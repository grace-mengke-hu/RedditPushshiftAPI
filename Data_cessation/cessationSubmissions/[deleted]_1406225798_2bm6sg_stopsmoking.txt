My mouth hurts.

Went on a long car ride yesterday, and I knew it would be a problem out of habit, so I brought along my old pipe to smoke to the mouth. I took 5 or 6 puffs from one pack, and it hurt my mouth, killed my taste buds, and made me glad that after just a week and a half, I'm put off by the taste of tobacco.

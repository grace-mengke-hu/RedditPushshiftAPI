lowkey clean

hey, uh, i've been clean for like...3 weeks, i think? 

i started smoking when i was 12, after getting pissed at my parent and trying to be like saint jimmy (the guy from the video for Jesus Of Suburbia by Green Day) lol, started smoking multiple times a week during summer of '18 (when i was 13).

now, as i'm nearing the anniversary of 14 years of existance, i've been trying to quit to not like,,,, die of coughing up my lungs lol.

so yeah, quit cold turkey and i haven't smoked for three weeks.

Quit 7 days ago. Just gave my gf a seeing to she hasn't enjoyed in years.

I'm 34 and smoked for about 14 years. I decided smoking was a young mans game and quit last Friday (cold turkey) and my energy levels and circulation (cough cough) have increased enormously. I couldn't possible go back to it now, my gf would kill me!
Stick to it guys. Totally worth it.

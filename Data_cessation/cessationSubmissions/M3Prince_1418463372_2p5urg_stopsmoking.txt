Beginning of day 11 nicotene free. Here. Dreams?

Ive been doing great, but every night i keep dreaming about smoking.  Its almost a nightmare.  I dreamt last night I smoked "one".  Then a "second" and i was cursing and crying cause i knew i was back.  Very weird stuff.  Anyone else having weird dreams?

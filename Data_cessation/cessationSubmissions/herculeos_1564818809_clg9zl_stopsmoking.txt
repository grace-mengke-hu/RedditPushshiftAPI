17 days! Running is going very well already!

It's so good to notice how quickly my body heals. Really amazing, beyond any expectations. I can run 2.5 kilometers at 15.5 km per hour, while I could hardly run a few hundred meters when I started. It's hard to believe how quickly this went.

My goal is to be able to run 5 kilometers in less than 15 minutes (faster than 20 kilometers per hour), so that I can win that part of a triathlon (which is in the start of this particular race). That will make me probably more than 2 minutes faster than the second. I will also practice my cycling, I am sure that I won't win that section, but it's nice to be able to be first in the race for a while and to have a good overall time.

My body has this ability, I am certain of that, given my past results. Last year I also did this race, and even though I was still smoking back then and my training started later, I ran the 5k in 18 minutes (I came in 7th).

What I will do to win:

* NOT SMOKE, EVER!
* Keep training hard and smart.
* Continue to lose weight.
* Live healthily (good food, good sleep, relax and be happy)

The triathlon is a nice challenge, I mostly do it to inspire me for the next months to push my limits and take good care of myself, though I will enjoy the feeling of finishing first and I am curious how people will respond to that, it's new to me to excel in a race like that.

I hope that makes you even more enthusiastic to quit as well, or to stick with it. You probably have other goals why you quit (and I have some other motivations as well), but it's certain that quitting will do many good things for everyone of us,. so let's do this, out of love for ourselves! And our loved ones, of course.

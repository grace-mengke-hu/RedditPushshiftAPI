So I woke up today and didn't need an inhaler!

Hey guys. I recently quit after 12 years of heavy smoking. Though smoking has many unpleasant side effects, it's effect on my asthma was arguably the worst. Before smoking, I had maybe 2 or 3 bad asthma attacks per year, mainly due to allergies. The more I smoked, the more frequent these attacks became. Eventually it got to the point where I needed my inhaler at least 4 times a day. Mornings were the worst. I'd wake up barely able to breathe and need at least 4 puffs from the inhaler to be able to breathe enough to smoke.  Not to mention barely being able to breathe all night makes for a very unrestful sleep. I've woken my girlfriend and son up with my audible wheezing or deperate scrambles to find the inhaler...but not anymore.

After a little over a week of quitting, I can already breathe much better. I've been longboarding a lot which is surely helping my cardio and I've barely used my inhaler! After putting my son down for his nap I noticed that it was sitting in the same spot as yesterday. That means I woke up breathing fine, didn't rush to the inhaler for relief, and proceeded to go about my day without a smoke! So here's to breathing, it's quite nice.

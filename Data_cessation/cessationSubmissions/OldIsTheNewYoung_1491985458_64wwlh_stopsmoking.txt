I'm getting close to year now.

I'm getting close to year now.
My initial post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4nrehm/28_days_later/ 
(23 years of smoking 25-30 a day)

I never thought I could make it and my coworkers and friends thought the same. I proved everybody including myself wrong.

Now it is a "foggy" memory whenever someone talks about smoking or is going outside to have a cigarette. It wasn't easy at the beginning but every day it went better and better. There are weeks I never even think about cigarettes at all.

Now I'm changing a lot of other things in my lifestyle because I'm not the fittest and healthiest person: 
If I can stop smoking then I can change my diet and start biking again. It's a huge boost of self-confidence. 
The side effect of saving a lot of money enabled me to buy a bike that fits my height, size and weight.
And I could buy a new state-of-the-art laptop and a new guitar/amp and started playing again :)

So: It is possible although it might not seem like it when you "start stopping".

100 days :)

Just realised the 100 day smoke free mark is on Halloween :D
I haven't posted for ages so I just thought I'd check in and let you know that I'm still going strong!
That self destructive "I don't want to smoke but I want to do something destructive and it used to be smoking" thing just went away after a day or so and I haven't remotely wanted to smoke since :)

It's so weird to think it's only been 3 months. Feels like I never smoked! :)
Keep going guys, it's so worth it xx

Advice for 1st week

I'm taking a vacation from work to quit smoking,  exercise,  and start eating better. 

My diet: fast food, pizza,  soups, has been dictated by my smoking habits,  and I never took to vegetables so I'm at a loss on where to start. 

With exercise I plan to start running 10 minutes a day to start. Also,  any advice from runners who use head phones would be welcomed.   I've tried using ear buds but they keep falling out.  :(

For mind set,  I'm reading' How to quit smoking the easy way' and I've downloaded the Smoke Free Beta app.  

I've quit successfully with the patch before but I'm debating between it and the crash course of cold turkey.   

I want to turn my life style around and I know it takes more than a week,  but I want to build the foundation for these habits to keep the momentum going. 

Any advice on any points would be appreciated.

When does the "emptiness" go away?

I've been smoke-free for three days now and I'm extremely happy about that!

However I've noticed that when I have a craving, and to some extent all the time, I feel a certain emptiness, like something is missing, a void that frustratingly can't be filled.

I've experienced similar feelings when quitting other addictions and I'm not concerned about controlling the emotions related to it, but I'm wondering just how long this will be a part of my day to day life?

Is this there whenever there's a craving, does the "background noise" go away, or what?

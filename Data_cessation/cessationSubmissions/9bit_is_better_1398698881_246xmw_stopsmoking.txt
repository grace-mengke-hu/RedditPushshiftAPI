SO Smokes, I want to quit - Help !

Hi Guys, Well done to everyone here that has given/is giving up ! I really support you !

I'll get down to the point i'm making - So a year ago I tried to quit, not cold turkey, I used an Ecig & a Patch and it went well for the first couple of days. 

This issue i have is that my SO smokes, I spend a lot of time with her and I relapsed last time because it was so hard to resist when one is being smoked right there in front of you ( I'd had a bad day because i lost my patches and my Ecig had run out which didn't help )  


My Question here is - Has anyone tried to give up and their SO is still smoking, what did you find helped ? anything to avoid ? 


I've asked her how she feels about quitting and she doesn't want too right now "maybe some day in the future" 

Thanks for any advice guys !

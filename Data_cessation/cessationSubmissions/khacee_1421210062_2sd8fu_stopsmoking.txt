17 days into second time quitting.

The first time was easy. I got pregnant, and the slightest smell of it made me nauseous. And plus, I was pregnant, so win-win right? 
I had no cravings. It had been over a year.   After I went back to work was another story.  The smell was no longer making me nauseous and I started missing "smoke" breaks with coworkers.  I caved. And ever since I've regretted that lapse in judgment. Now, two years, later I am ready to quit. Again.  And I did, about 17 days ago. I had a really bad chest cold and it literally hurt to smoke so I decided now is a better time than never. It's been OK. No major cravings. 
I am really glad I stumbled upon this sub red, because I kept telling myself in a few months it won't hurt to reward myself with just one. 
Any advice on what to do to avoid just one mentality?

Back again

Managed to last 2-3 months or something, about a month ago for some reason I bought a pack and started once again. I'm not sure why, I think it was to do with my new job - I thought it would be a good idea to quit for, so I did. It turned out some other employees smoke and it almost gave me a green light? Absolutely ridiculous reason to start again and I'm once again ready to quit. Again. Again. Again. My mouth is disgusting, my chest hurts, I can't workout as hard as I could and I feel disappointed in myself for being weak. So here goes nothing.

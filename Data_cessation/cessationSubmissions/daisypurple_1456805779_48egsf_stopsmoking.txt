ack!

For the past week, I've been trying to make 'today' the last day. But then keep having 'just that one' cigarette, then feeling shitty about myself. 
I've made it a couple days here and there. I downloaded the Smoke Free app today. Am hoping it will give me inspiration, as it's on my phone and I can look at my progress whenever I get a craving. Anyone used this app?

"I don't smoke."

Sometimes, the offer of a cigarette can catch us off guard, and our impulsive voice that wants to say "yes" can override our better judgement in the moment of decision. Even a quick moment of hesitation can lead to our giving in, and accepting that cigarette. What I find helpful, though perhaps a bit strange, is to practice saying it out loud, as a way of getting used to hearing myself decline the offer. If you've said it before, you'll be better prepared to say it again. Please say it with me:

**"No thanks, I don't smoke."**

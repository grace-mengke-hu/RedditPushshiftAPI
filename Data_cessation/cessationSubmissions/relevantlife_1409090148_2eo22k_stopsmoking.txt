Today is day 18, and I feel empowered.

It's been rough, but it's definitely a better choice. My anxiety levels are down, I smell better and I breathe easier. 

Going the rest of my life without a cigarette seems daunting, but I know I will feel better if i continue to resist the urge to quit.

The irritability has been a bit high at times, but now that I'm almost 3 weeks out I think I'm less anxious without tobacco as I am with it. 

Either way, it's been a rough journey but I'm pleased with the results thus far.

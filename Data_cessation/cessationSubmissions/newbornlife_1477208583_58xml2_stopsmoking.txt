1 hr 20 min from last smoke

I lingered 1 more day... I wrapped up my leftover pack with the letter to myself so i can open it up in chiristmas eve. Its little gift to future myself for enduring 2 months smoke free. 

Today i thought about smoking and all the associated circumstances that i had to light up today. I needed it because i was stressed out because of my assignment due at 11pm. Why was i stressed out for the assignment? Becuz I was not prepared in time. Why were i not prepared? Because i procrastinated when i had enough time.  Therefore, if i had not procrastinated, i didnt have to light up my smoke.

Its just not about smoking, it may be about my life habit to deal with my responsibilities. Also, by smoking, i am actually procrastinating on taking care of my health. 

I feel i need to change not just habit of lighting up and inhaling. I need to change even more than that.

See you guys tmw and i hope the title of the next post would be 1day and 1 hour from last smoke

Cutting back?

I know it’s possible to quit, but I‎t just feels so impossible. What do you guys think about the cutting back way of quitting? For one week, only give myself 5 a day, the next go down to 4 a day, and so on till it’s one a day and my body is adjusting to smoking less. Then quitting altogether. Thoughts?

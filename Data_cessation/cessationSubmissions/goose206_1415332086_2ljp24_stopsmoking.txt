Starting over again

I was feeling bored/confused/apathetic and bought a pack a couple of months ago. Was sneaking smokes during the workday (work at home) and hiding the smell from my girlfriend. 

I'd get through half a pack, and then throw the rest away because I started feeling like shit physically. Then I'd buy another pack the next day and start over. This went on for awhile.

It's been a couple weeks since my last cigarette. I chew tea tree oil toothpicks whenever I think about it. I don't want to smoke again.

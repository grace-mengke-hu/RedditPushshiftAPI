I smoked a butt today after 3 weeks of quitting.

I feel so terrible. I'm drunk right now, I just smoked a butt that was a little less then half a cigarette. I have gone 3 weeks, I didn't cheat - not once - til less than 3 minutes ago. First thing I diddid was come here. I want to cry. I really do. My boyfriend still smokes, we're up drinking... which this isn't the first time I've drank since I quit and I was fine all the other times... he left to go grab a pack because he ran out and I snuck one. I don't want to start all over! Please tell me this isn't the end. I don't want to start all over. I don't want to smoke another, but goddamm if that wasn't good. I dont want to reset my badge. Thank god for autocorrect, sorry for the rambling. I love you guys. I came here first. Please tell me I'm still quit. :(

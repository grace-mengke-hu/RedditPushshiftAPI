Day 12...sugar crash = nicotine cravings

So I understand the link between nicotine withdrawals and sugar cravings. But does it work the other way? 

I’ve found in the last few days when I’ve been gorging on sweets (boredom combined with hormones), I get a craving for a cigarette after the sugar crash. Anyone else?

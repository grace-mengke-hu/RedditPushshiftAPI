Am I still Proud? yes. Am I proud. No?

Heavy smoker for ten years. It's been 28 days and I have a craving every now and then. I have had to stop drinking basically since every time I drink I get the urge to smoke to the point of feeling insane. Last weekend, I had four cigarettes. 

So, basically I've had to quit drinking and smoking both at the same time. I felt like my relationship was about to fall apart last week, I felt like I was going to lose my mind. 

So, when normally I would have had about 200 cigarettes since quitting, I have only had four, yes I am proud of that. But the fact that I gave in and had a few, no I am not that proud.

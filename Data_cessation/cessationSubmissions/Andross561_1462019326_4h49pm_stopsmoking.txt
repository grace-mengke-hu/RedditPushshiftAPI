4 months!

This is the longest I've gone without smoking since I started smoking. It hasn't always been easy but it does get a little easier everyday. Even though I'm finally feeling comfortable in my own body, and my ability to stay nicotine free I am constantly reminding myself to be ever vigilant. Nicotine is a smooth talking, convincing son of a bitch and I will have to remain on my guard for the rest of my life. But I will do so with my head held up high, knowing that I'm winning the gold fight! 



Moral of the story is: it can be done! Good luck everyone. Not another puff no matter what.

Quitting again

Hello guys,  I am kind of Newbie here,  but I would like to share my story with you: 
I was not smoking for 180 days. I had well-paid, but very annoying night time job + a lot of other activities. So on my 181 night I felt so exhausting and tired of my extra difficult life-schedule that I smoked,  on my night shift. That was a really terrible craving. I was resisting for a few days and I felt that I am going crazy.
So now I am afraid of quitting again as I believe that there will be another moment like that and it will all start over. 
However,  I don't like smoking either do today I am quitting. Quitting again.
Wish me luck guys.
And,  yes,  a peace of advice would be very nice.
Maybe you had similar problems.
Again, sorry for my poor English.

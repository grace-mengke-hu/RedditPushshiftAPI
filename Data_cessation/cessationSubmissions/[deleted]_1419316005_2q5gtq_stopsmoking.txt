Anyone tried to quit after only a year?

So I've been smoking for a little over a year now and it's time to kick the addiction (not just a habit anymore).  

I'm 17 and really don't want my early adult years to be swamped by cigarettes.  

I smoke about 3-8 day, though I've been smoking a considerable amount more recently.  

I know if I quit now it will be much easier 

Anyone here have experience quitting as a teenager? Any help would be great.  Thanks in advance!

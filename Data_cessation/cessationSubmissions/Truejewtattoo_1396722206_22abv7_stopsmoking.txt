day 2

Bummed my last smoke a couple of nights ago and it has been ~40 hours since. I am 26 years old and have only been smoking for about a year. I picked it up because I went through a rough break up and was spending my nights at the bar. It was a quick and easy way to get back into a few social circles. I definatly regret making that choice and have been feeling a lot better lately. Hopefully I can make this work.

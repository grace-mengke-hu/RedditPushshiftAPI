The dreams. The visualizations. They haunt :(

Dear Reddit,

I'm off the nasty things since 2 weeks now. Although I know for real that I'm never going to light again, I have a few things still bothering me.    
    
1- I get frequent dreams of myself smoking and enjoying the cigarettes in company of my buddies.    
    
    
2- I get odd pangs and visualizations of me lighting one and having fun.
    
    
I've been a heavy smoker for about 6 years and have quit after a lot of failed attempts. I want this one to stick. I'm dealing with odd pangs (that i was hoping to be gone after 2 weeks) and the persuasive dreams but Iâ€™m afraid I might fail in a moment of weakness. How do i deal with this?

Two Weeks!

After struggling for over a month I found the best method for me to stop quitting. I couldn't do cold turkey so I started smoking one a day after work, it started out horrible. All I could think about was how I wanted to smoke. After awhile I got used to it and later I started to not look forward to the one smoke a day. Now I'm going without and I feel fine. When I had cravings I would just do pull ups or push ups. Something to associate it with pain or soreness. The cravings still come back naturally but it's not on my mind all the time like it used to be.

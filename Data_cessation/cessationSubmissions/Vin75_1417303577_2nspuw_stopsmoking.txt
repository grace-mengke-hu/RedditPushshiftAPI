Nicotine "Free" - 4 Days... Finally!

A couple of months ago I posted here asking if anyone knew what was going on with the Nicabate lozenges and other nicotine replacement edibles being pulled form the market in some countries. Anyway, thanks to some of your responses, I watched Allan Carrs "EasyWay" video and sat through the hour or so and finally decided to put myself through the process of getting off nicotine for good.

Well, after being between cigarettes (around 10 a day), nicotine gum and lozenges for the past 15 years, for the first time I am starting to feel free. I had my last Gum on Wednesday morning and was doing really well... until Friday morning. I wanted to murder someone. The little monster was crying for nicotine... I was working and somehow had to get through the day. Seriously though - I knew what was going on and I was just telling myself - this is the worst it will be and I can get though it. Well, when I awoke on Saturday morning I felt better and continued to feel good all day. Today is Sunday and I am feeling fine. The worst is over and I am looking forward to my journey continuing without the cloud of nicotine hanging over me constantly.

I know I have another week or so to really get past the cravings completely, but I know I can do it!!!

Thank you redditors for helping me make the final decision. I appreciate your support!

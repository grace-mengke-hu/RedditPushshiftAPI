Starting on day 1

This morning I woke up and felt a lunp in my throat. It's happened before, but usually goes away after some water, breakfast, and a smoke. I decided to check it out, and I was shocked to see that my throat looked like it was rotting. I guess it scared me enough to make today Day 1. Anyone have any stories of making the change and starting on Day 1? Oh and I'm 19, been smoking since high school but never as seriously as when i started working at where I am now, with three other smokers (aproximately 8 months back).

TLDR: Symptoms of Throat Cancer make me want to quit. HBU?

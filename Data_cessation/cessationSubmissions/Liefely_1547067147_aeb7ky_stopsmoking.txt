Threw away my smokes but failed to quit AGAIN

More of a lurker usually but I guess there's no harm in sharing.

I have been smoking about 30/40 cigarettes a day for the past 11 years. Before that I was a social smoker for a year or two. 

After getting off work yesterday I read Allen Carr's book and decided to throw away my smokes. I have been trying to quit unsuccessfully  since New Year's but I thought I kicked the habit for good with help from the book. I felt confident. Today was allright. Didn't smoke. Not even in my lunch break. Instead I just re-read a passage from the book.

I just caved and smoked two cigarettes from the bin. They didn't taste great (but not th√°t bad either) and now I'm ashamed of myself and appalled that I couldn't contain my cravings. 

Any words of encouragement or advice are fully appreciated. I'm at a bit of a loss now. My boyfriend hasn't smoked since January 1st and he was smoking just as heavy as I did. Why can't I just quit?!

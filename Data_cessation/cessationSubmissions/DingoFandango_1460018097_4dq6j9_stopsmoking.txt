2 years + checking in ... You can do it!

Hi all, haven't thought about any of this in a while. Haven't thought about having a cigarette in ages either! Happy to say I am smoke free, healthy, go to the gym regularly (although I didn't at first... Little steps) and most of all looking forward to a lung cancer free future. The saying is true, if I can do it, so can you. I used to come here for encouragement so hope this helps.

Coming up on 20 hours now....

So last night I decided cold turkey, that's it.... I'm done!!!! I'm 29 yes old and I WAS a pack a day to 2 pack a day smoker for the past 10-11 years and started smoking earlier then that. 

I am sitting on the couch last night with my wife (who has bee n smoke free for the past 3 months after being about a half a pack a day smoker. I could not be more proud of her) My wife is super supportive and fives me a little extra incentive, she say "everyday yoy don't have a cigarette I will give you the most amazing blowjob" when you get home. Well I have been thinking about quitting over the last month or so and this is an offer I just cannot refuse. I don't want to fucking do this anymore.... I went to the closet and grabbed the 2 and a half cartons I had there and tossed them and my lighters away and haven't looked back.
 I am not saying today at work was easy, as there are tons of triggers, but I kept a toothpick in my mouth at my desk all day. And when the craving got really bad a couple times, I just got up from my desk and went outside as I usually  would to smoke, but instead I opened up r/stopsmoking and read a bunch of posts and comments from you guys and before I knew it the craving was gone, so ty all. Now I'm off work and heading home..... And I haven't been  more excited to do that in a very long time :) 
I am going to stick with this and probably vent a bunch of times here, so I will apologise in advance lol..... But keep up the good work everyone else who is currently fighting this battle.... We can do it!

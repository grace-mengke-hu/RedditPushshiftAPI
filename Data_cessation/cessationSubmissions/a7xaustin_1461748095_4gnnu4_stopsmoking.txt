Current smoker of 8 years, here to discuss with others about steps to quit.

Hello fellow smokers and quitters. I am 20 years old and have been smoking since I was 12. I am tired of constantly feeling sick and tired, I'm tired of being anxious for a cigarette, I've just started to work out at the gym and my oh my would it be easier if I wasn't a smoker. I am also a singer who is always working on improving and it hinders my voice. 

I've had one unsuccessful attempt when I was 16, when I went 18 hours without a smoke before I caved in. I don't think I was *actually* prepared for it. Now that I'm older, and I want to see my life without cigarettes, I'm beginning to desperately look for a way out, while I'm still smoking. It's quite counterproductive. The thought of even quitting makes me anxious, and I get scared. When I get anxious and scared, I light up a cigarette. I suppose, I'm just here because I'm not sure where to start.

I've heard of Allan carr's "Easy way to quit smoking" and as I'm not much of a reader, I was really thinking about getting it on DVD. Has anybody here had experience with the book and/or DVD? Any help, tips, or advice is wonderful and greatly appreciated! :)

Stay beautiful redditors!

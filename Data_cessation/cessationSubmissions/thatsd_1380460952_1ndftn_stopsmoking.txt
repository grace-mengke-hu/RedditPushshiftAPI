I just went a week cold turkey, want a cigarette really bad today, please tell me it get's easier?!

Been a smoker since my school days, which is around 5 years now. I was never a heavy smoker, I probably averaged 5 a day. Decided to start the new semester and try to be healthier and quite cold turkey,  by cold turkey I mean cold turkey ie no patches/ecigs/anything like that. Any tips to stamp out cravings?

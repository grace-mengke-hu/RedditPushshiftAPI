It's been a week and I feel amazing

After nine years and cutting back from 3 packs to a half pack a day I'm finally a week without cigarettes. I bought a vape to help quit and it's been working great for me. I no longer feel the need to smoke cigarette after cigarette. I've noticed a massive improvement in my lung capacity and my senses of smell and taste have increased.  Life is defiantly more enjoyable now, I think I might even start working out again.

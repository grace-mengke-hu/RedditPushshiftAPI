Wish me luck!

Yesterday I smoked my (hopefully) last cigarette. I have been lurking in this subreddit for quite a while and after passing my A levels I decided it was enough. So I will attempt to completely stop smoking. I got rid of everything already and at the moment I'm optimistic that I can do it. Wish me luck!

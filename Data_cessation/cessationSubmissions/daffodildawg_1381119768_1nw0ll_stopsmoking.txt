Smoking cigarettes during drinking

I went about 6 months without cigarettes for a while, but then in July I started up again. I haven't been buying packs, which is significant. The problem is that I can go through my whole week not smoking a single cigarette, but when I get a day to relax, have a few beers, maybe smoke some pot, I crave cigarettes and go right back to them. Is there any advice for somebody trying to go completely cold turkey?

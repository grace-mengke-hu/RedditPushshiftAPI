16 years of smoking and i want to quit, help?

I've been smoking since i was 12 (yeah, i know), i'm 28 now and i'm in therapy trying to get my life on track, this also includes that i started running, and i'm loving it, but my breathing i terrible, i'm so short on breath and i hate it. My condition overall is super bad cause i've been sitting on my ass for the last 4 years without a job, so this means that if i quit i will have a lot of time to want to smoke, cause i don't have much to do besides the 4 days per week of therapy. I would really like some tips to get me through the hours where i dont have much distraction from smoking, as i use that a lot "i'm bored so i'll smoke". Please help, cause i really want to quit this shit and become healthy.

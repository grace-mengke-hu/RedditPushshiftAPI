Four months. Worth it. It gets better. (etc)

Four months. Quit cold turkey.
Wasn't sure whether I should post and "brag." Decided I wanna help out the newcomers with the one thing that got me here. It isn't the "easiest way" (No pun intended--I did read Easy Way and it helped tremendously). However, it has helped me from relapsing!

My tip?
Never avoid a craving. Meet it head on and let that feeling wash over you. Realize it is the addiction. A separate entity entirely from yourself. Then feel it fade away as quickly as it came. They get shorter and less frequent as time goes by.

I read of so many people who try to avoid the discomfort. It's not that bad! Stare it right in the face and tell it to fuck off! (Figuratively)

I almost unsubscribed from here, but I realize the discomfort I experience while reading about cigarettes only strengthens my resolve. 

Did have a couple slip ups, but only a couple times when I relapsed drinking a month back. Haven't had a sober smoke in 4 months and that's what I'm sticking with. I'm not myself when I drink anyway. 

Addiction is a crazy thing, but it gets better!

edit: I realized my post sounds like I still drink and smoke on occasion. This is NOT true! Don't really wanna go into my full story, but 4 months ago I quit drinking and smoking. Went three months without drinking before I relapsed for two weeks. In those 2 weeks I smoked probably 3 cigarettes total those 2 weeks (that I remember) and ALL while shit-housed. I, luckily, hopped back on the wagon almost 4 weeks ago. And that was the end of my (miniscule) trip up on the cigarette side.

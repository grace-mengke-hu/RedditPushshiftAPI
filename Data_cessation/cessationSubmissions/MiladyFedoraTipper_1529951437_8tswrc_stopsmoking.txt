I'm putting an end to it today

I've been smoking for around 5-6 years now and i've wanted to stop for a while now. And today i'm doing it, finally putting an end to it. It's been affecting my health quite a bit and i acknowledge the long term effects of smoking. I really hope to be able to do it.

Wish me luck.

Badge reset... Here's to starting over

So i started smoking again recently and realized something.. Since i work at american eagle and can buy a pair of jeans for 15 bucks, i literally could have bought a new pair of jeans every other day for the last month instead of smoking.  So after quitting for nearly a year im starting quitting again.  I'd say wish me luck but we all know luck doesn't have anything to do with it, it's all on us.

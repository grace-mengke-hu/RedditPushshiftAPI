35 days vaping: no packs bought. I've smoked 5 cigs and 1 cigarillo. I haven't smoked anything for 9 days. Is my "lax" policy working or do I just need to go zero tolerance?

I've attempted to quit several times in my life. Some of them were cold turkey and some were with vaping. My best quit was last year for 41 days cold turkey.

35 days ago, I woke up without smokes and decided I'd re-stock my e-cig gear and try to quit. In the first two weeks, I bummed three cigarettes. I was skeptical of what I was doing but felt very comfortable with this new idea of *generally* not smoking. The next week I avoided bumming smokes but broke down and bought a cigarillo to share with my friend. The next weekend, I went out drinking and bummed two cigs. Nonetheless, I was functioning great without smoking on a daily basis and didn't feel terrible about my occasional smoking.

Now, I'm 9 days without any smokes and I feel pretty good. The question, I guess, is whether I need to modify my policy a bit. Can I just continue with this "see what happens" policy or do I need to be more strict with myself? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

Three years and three hours!

Three hours ago from this moment was three full years since I smoked the last cigarette I'll ever smoke. I owe it mostly to Allen Carr's video seminar Easy Way to Stop (Quit) Smoking. "There is no such thing as one cigarette." That is the motto I have owned and made my own. Through many trying times those simple words got me through temptation and I am happy to say I have not had even a single drag off a cigarette since I quit. There is hope for everyone! Good luck to all of you and stay strong!!

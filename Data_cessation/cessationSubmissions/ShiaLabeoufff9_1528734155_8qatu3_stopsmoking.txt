miserable

so i’ve been trying to quit for atleast a month. read allen carr’s book. i just keep messing up. i felt good for a few days the most i ever get is like 2. and now i’m just like if i can just quit for another 2 days i won’t smoke ever again. just bought a pack. was so stressed this morning and went out. it’s the morning that get me. i am around people who are constantly smoking and i want to just lock myself in my room for a week to get over this but that’s just not an option bc i go to school. some advice would be appreciated.

I never thought it would be this bad

I started smoking about a year and a half ago. It started off as something to do socially. I was having a single cigarette every few days, that quickly turned into one a day then 2 a day all the way up to about 6 a day. I know that this is nothing in comparison to smokers who are on 40 a day but yesterday I decided that enough is enough and went cold turkey. I'm finding it extremely difficult to stay off the smokes and I haven't caved in yet but I'm worried that I might. The cravings are awful and I feel terrible. I know that I'll start to feel better in about a week or so but making it that far is the problem. Is there any advise on getting through the first week? Any tips will be much appreciated

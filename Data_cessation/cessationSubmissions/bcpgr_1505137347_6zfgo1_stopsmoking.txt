6 days of not smoking, getting drunk last night, didn't smoke!!!

Every time I stopped smoking I failed the first time I got drunk. After 4 tries in 10 years, this fifth is looking like it's gonna stick. As the title says I got shitface drunk last night and didn't grab a smoke of off people at the party (almost everyone was smoking). This is a sort of a rant, but I'm so proud of myself that I had to share it with someone (:

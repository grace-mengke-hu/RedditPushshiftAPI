30 days! Here's what I've learned

I never thought I could make it. I kept wondering how I'd be able to enjoy a drink again or a good cup of coffee without a cigarette. But as it turns out, my drinks and my coffees have become tastier and easier to enjoy than before. I was a slave and I didn't even know it.
To those of you quitting now, you'll soon find yourself smelling and tasting again. I almost cried when that happened to me, because I wasn't aware of the damage I had done to myself. 
I also started having an amazing amount of energy. For entire years I thought I was a lethargic person. A person that gets bored easily. I wasn't! It was the smoking that made me feel like this.
Keep going quitters. There's only freedom and joy at the end of this path! Best of luck!

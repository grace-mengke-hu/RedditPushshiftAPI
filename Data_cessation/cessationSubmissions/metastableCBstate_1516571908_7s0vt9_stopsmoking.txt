"cravings" when quitting?

I'm on my 26th hour, and it seems like instead of getting very severe cravings occasionally, smoking is on my mind all the time in a more managable way. Does this change after a few days, or will it be all I think about for a long time?

I was convinced this would be it and waited till the semester break to quit but I was given a new project which fucked up my opportunity, I don't think I can focus on it like this...

5 days and still going strong

So it has been 5 days since I last had a smoke.  For the first 3 days of quitting I was sick, still have a bit of a sore throat, but am now up and around and have no want/craving to have a cigarette.  

What I have noticed as of last night after going to bed is that there is some weazing sounds when I am breathing just before I feel asleep.  They did not seem to last long, but where also there this morning as I was on my phone catching up on the world for a bit, again though they didn't last long.  As this is the first time this has happened, I am wondering if this is normal for people to go through when stopping?

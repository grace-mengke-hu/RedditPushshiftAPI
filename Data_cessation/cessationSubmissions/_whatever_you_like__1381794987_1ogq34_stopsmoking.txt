Just requested my badge!

So I just requested my badge to start for tomorrow! Ive been putting it off for too long now. It's gotten to the point where when I smoke I get an awful headache. 

I just wanted to know if anyone has any advice for the attitude aspect of quitting. Several times before I've tried quitting and I get very irritable. And I haven't really found anything that would help me with this. Any suggestions. Thanks! Wish me luck!

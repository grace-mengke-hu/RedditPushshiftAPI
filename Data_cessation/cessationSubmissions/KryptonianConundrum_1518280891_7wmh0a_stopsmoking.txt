Re-quitting.

I quit last year in September. Lasted a good 3.5 months. Come NYE, I simply ended up having a pack. And then that continued until now. I went all crazy. Smoked more than I usually did. Kept saying to myself subconsciously that I have control and I'll eventually quit. But for now, I'm gonna smoke to my heart's content.

Clearly, this thinking is a real black hole &gt;&lt;

I quit this morning. Resisted for 8 hours and ended up lighting up again. Clearly, it's more the boredom and not wanting to do anything. Doesn't help that I'm also dealing with massive depressive disorder. 

Anyways, as of tonight, I take the pledge again. And I'll need your support and help (just like last time).

Thank you, one and all for being there. 

Help me stay a non-smoker for life, please :)

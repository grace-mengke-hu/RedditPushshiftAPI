What mint candy tastes most like a mint Equate Nicotine Lozenge?

I'm going to be stepping off of nicotine lozenges very shortly, having successfully used them to stop smoking.  I'd like some kind of mint candy to replace them with for a while, just to get my oral fix for a while once I'm done, anyone have an idea on what mint candy out there tastes / feels most like a lozenge from Equate?  I'd rather save myself from buying/tossing 50 packs of mints in my quest, so if you've got pointers I'd appreciate hearing from you!

Over a month smoke free and about to cave....

Help me guys.

Today has been a hellish day at work. I'm over a month smoke free using my vape more than I drink water. I feel the need to smoke to reduce the stress like the old days, but I know I shouldn't. I feel as if I might be too weak to fight the urge, even though I know it is purely habitual.

Please give me some sound advice and remind me how stupid I am for even thinking about it.

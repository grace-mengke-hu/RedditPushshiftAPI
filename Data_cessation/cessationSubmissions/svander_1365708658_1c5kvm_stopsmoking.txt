2 years today

After smoking for 20 years about half a pack a day... I still remember that night two years ago. I finished reading Easyway to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr and threw out the rest of the pack as I closed the book. I cried a bit because the magnitude of the moment was something I wasn't quite prepared for - but haven't looked back.

I can say honestly that I've craved it once or twice but am quickly reminded how how much I really hated the habit and myself while doing it which makes any craving disappear instantly. I've had the occasional dream where I see myself smoking and wake up feeling both relieved that I didn't really screw things up but also embarrassed that I even dreamt it which subconsciously I guess would imply that I still miss it.

Regardless, I'm just coming here to say that it can be done and done easily if you're ready to make that decision, but ultimately it has to start with you wanting to stop.

Do it today.

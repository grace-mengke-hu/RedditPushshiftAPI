2 Years

Where does time go? 2 years ago today I didn't decide to quit smoking, all I did was run out of cigarettes at 1am, and was too lazy to get more so I said screw it I'll get them in the morning. After I woke up, for whatever reason I just decided to see how long I could go before the urges got the best of me, and it's been 2 years. The first week sucked, the first month was awful, but since then it's been smooth sailing.

Doesn't matter how many times you fail, as long as you keep trying. You only need to quit for the last time once, and any reason is a good reason to kick the habit. Good luck on your progress, all.

Feeling bad as shit and cause of that wanting to smoke

Going through some arguments with my s/o, well not much arguments she just tends to get really insulting and hurtful in the midst of a discussion, just cause she wants to make her point clear. This is giving me emotional stress.. now i am laying here contemplating whether i should i go downstairs to the night shop to buy a pack of cigarettes or not. When i get emotionally stressed, my first reaction was always to smoke but since i have quit for over 6 months i canâ€™t, last few months were a breeze but moments like this kill me.. i have no idea what to do an i feel like rly close to smoking and being addicted again.. all your advice is welcome guys. 

Thanks in advance

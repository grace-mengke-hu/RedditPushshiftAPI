Waking up at 5:30 this morning was the last straw. I'm done.

Dear Reddit,

I'm doing it today.

I'm mostly a lurker on Reddit and I've spent little to no time on this subreddit, so I don't know any of you. But I'm telling you I'm doing it today, because I so badly want to believe I can this time.

I'm only 24, and I've quit smoking more times than that, I think. Sometimes I've had success for months, and then something always happens. You know how it is, I'm sure. One time I quit for two months and then my grandmother died. Another time I quit for three months and then one day it was raining. I know you know what I mean.

I said I was going to quit when I graduated. I started working in a kitchen. OK, maybe after this job.

I said I was going to quit when I moved to New York. They're so expensive here, I can't afford them. Turns out I'm bad at budgeting and just keep buying them.

I said I was going to quit when hacking up loogies became morning routine. Well, routines adapt and I worked it in.

You know what gets me today, Reddit? It's not the fact that I spent $13 for a pack of smokes yesterday even after walking to the store repeating to myself that I'm not going to buy smokes, just a... (If I could have finished that sentence, maybe I'd be less addicted.) It's not the fact that I continue to spend $5.50 a day on the subway instead of riding my bike, when I LOVE riding my bike, because my goddamn lungs are too sore. It's not the fact that I have loose teeth (really) at 24. And it's not even the fact that this addictive drug is eventually going to kill me.

You know what it is? It's because I woke up this morning, at 5:30, thinking about cigarettes and unable to fall back asleep. I don't have a meeting till 11 on Tuesdays. I usually get to my office at 10:30, which means leaving at 9:45, which means (for me) waking up at 8:30. I should have had three more hours of sleep.

And I'm NOT a fucking morning person.

FUCK YOU, CIGARETTES. I SHOULD BE ASLEEP RIGHT NOW AND I AM NOT AND IT IS YOUR FAULT. I AM FURIOUS. WE ARE BREAKING UP. I AM DONE.

Reddit, I know that my tone may sound like I'm not serious, but I'm so serious. I'm not here to ask for adviceâ€“ I'm here to make it public, to give myself another reason to stick with it. OK, so I guess I am also here to ask for advice, not that there isn't plenty available in the threads below...

Wish me luck, Reddit. I feel surprisingly confident this time. Because if I haven't been motivated enough by wanting to improve my health, save money, smell better, etc., maybe this raw fury I am feeling at being woken up early will work. Maybe, hopefully. Anyway thanks for reading. I'll let you know when I hit milestones, I guess.

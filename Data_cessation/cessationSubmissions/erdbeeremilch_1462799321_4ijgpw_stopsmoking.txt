about to quit for the 20th (and dare I say last) time this year

hey stopsmoking!

I have been trying to quit for months now, with my personal best being 2 weeks without a cigarette. 

I've used the stop smoking app, I've listed reasons to quit, and I've enlisted the help of supportive friends.

on the flip side, I have an impulse control disorder which obvs complicates matters. I have bpd too which means that while one minute I might be completely committed to not smoking, the next minute I will not understand why I even tried to quit in the first place and hell, I'm gonna die anyway right?

basically I feel like I have loads of good reasons to stop smoking but just as many valid reasons to NOT stop. 

so I thought I would post here and start telling you folks the many reasons I want to quit as they occur to me, as well as getting some tips and encouragement along the way?

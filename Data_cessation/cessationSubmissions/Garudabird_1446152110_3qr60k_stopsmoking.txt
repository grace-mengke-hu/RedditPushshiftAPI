Fucking pissed off, best you don't read this.

So I'm really angry right now. I'm having a shit time at work and I just want to scream at everyone that I hate them. But I don't. I come to this sub which should be full of angry, withdrawal fueled maniacs, but it isn't. I want to punch the people here who are like 'I've been a smoker for 2 months and I'm so addicted' what the fuck do you know, talk to me when you get close to my 20 years, but I don't say that because this is actually a really supportive group.  So yes, I am having a bad day, but...I didn't  smoke. I have insulted my boss, I have insulted my best friend, I need to go for a run but I do not need to smoke. If I were a smoker my day would be just as bad but worse because I would need to find a way to smoke on top of all of this. Thanks for listening and indulging my rant, sorry if I offended anyone.

Day 2

Just started day 2. Pretty committed this time. My main stressor is my roommate and his annoying dog. Just trying not to freak out on either one of them in these next couple of weeks. Wish me luck 😁
Just been trying to tell myself that most of these negative feelings are just the little nicotine monster inside. 
Hoping the irritability, anger and distractions go away soon. Seriously cannot focus at work for more than 5 minutes at work. 🙄

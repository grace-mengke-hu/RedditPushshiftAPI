This is it

I started smoking when I was 15, I'm now 28. In the last couple years, I've done a lot to try to be a better me: eating healthier, exercising, even took up running 2 years ago. All while still smoking. 

I just smoked my last cigarette. I'm done. My throat feels scratchy. My mouth tastes gross. My fingers stink. I'm fuckin over this shit. This is my first quit attempt but damnit,  I'm gonna do this. I scared and nervous to change something I've done for almost half my life. But I am excited to be a non-smoker. Just wanted to share. Any tips and suggestions are awesome!

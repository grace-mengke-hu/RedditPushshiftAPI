[DEV] Released an Android App to help you quit your addiction, promo codes inside! (x-post /getdisciplined)

I have recently finished developing an app called "No More!" which is meant to support you in defeating any addiction or bad habit you'd like to get rid of. It's your classic day tracking / don't break the chain app, with a few extra features like milestones, motivational quotes and quick in-app website/contacts shortcuts, all wrapped in a nice material design interface.

The app was very well-welcomed on r/getdisciplined and several people suggested me to cross-post it here and in a few other subreddits that might benefit from this. Just to clarify, the app comes with advertisement plugged in and an in-app purchase to remove them - however for the launch window I decided to give you guys a promo code to disable the ads for free to prove that I'm not just spamming the boards.

* Go to the Settings
* Go to "Credits & Licenses"
* Tap "Enter Promo Code" and enter the code "*redditrules*". Enjoy!

All ads will be gone, you could still buy the in-app option in case you'd like to offer me a coffee as token of your appreciation ;)

Keep fighting!

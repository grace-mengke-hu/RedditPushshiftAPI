Ten year smoker, a week in today, and I just slipped up. 

I quit smoking a week ago. I did it for myself this time. I have a 16 month old son, and a wife who cares for me an insane amount. We got into a huge argument tonight about my selfishness. 

A little backstory here: I started smoking at 14. I'm 24 now. I've tried everything. I've done the e-cigs, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, cold turkey twice, and a weekend long backwoods camping trip. I've done it for all the wrong reasons, and for everyone other than myself. 

So here I am. I just smoked a cigarette that I found under the seat of my car in desperation. It seems that every time I've actually needed a cigarette I couldn't find one, but now, after I've quit for an entire week cold turkey, the longest I've ever gone, I find one. 

I'm so fucking bummed. I feel like a complete failure. I've felt so proud of myself the past week, like maybe I could conquer this and move on. Of course not, I just gave in. I suck so bad. 

I need help guys. A friend told me about this subreddit. He told me that maybe I could get some tips and support. I always thought that I could do this when I was ready, and do it on my own, but now I'm starting to doubt that. 

After a huge argument about my attitude and lifestyle tonight, I decided to smoke the cigarette that I found. Now I'm so heavy with guilt that I don't know what to do. I feel lousy. Like a complete failure. It wasn't even satisfying or worth it. I had a nightmare that I started smoking last night. It's so ironic that all this happened. It was almost subconscious, I grabbed that cigarette and smoked the hell out if it without even thinking about it. Now I feel like a complete moron. I've let my son down. 

Does anyone have any guidance? Any tips? Anything to help prevent me from slipping up again? How did you guys do it? I need all the support I can get, I'm totally miserable right now.

I've set a "Quit Date" - Good idea?/Bad idea?

So I'm new to this sub, but as I mentioned I have a quit date set for later this month. The Date was established a few weeks ago, keeping in mind when the Superbowl was... (From Seattle).

I wanted the opinion of some on this sub if this seems like a good idea or a bad idea. I've done this a few times in the past and sometimes it comes up too quick and I try to get as many smokes in as I can before the day of reckoning arrives and other times I just keep pushing it back another week.

Any thoughts on what I can expect to feel in the first days? first weeks? or after a month or so? I've never made it longer than a week for as long as I've been a smoker (around 5 years).

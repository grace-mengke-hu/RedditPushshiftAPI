Nearly at 24 hours after 35 years!

I smoked my last cig yesterday at 2pm. I’ve smoked for 35 years and over the last 3-4 smoked up to 35 a day.

I’m wearing a patch but it’s still painful. Palpitations, shaking hands, constantly thinking about lighting up but i’ve Never made it more than 4 hours before so i’m proud of myself. I’ve always promised that if I can get through 1 whole day without smoking I will never smoke again and i’m nearly at that benchmark.

How long do the initial symptoms go on for? When will I stop shaking and banging heart?

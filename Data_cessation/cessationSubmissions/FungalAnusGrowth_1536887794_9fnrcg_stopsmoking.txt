How can I quit for real and never pick it up again?

I've had many "successful" tries where I quit for one month but then smoke one and before you know it I have my own pack.

I want to quit for real, without feeling like I'm missing something out. I hate smoking, it makes me feel shit and I get too many colds from ir, yet I still continue, how can quit for good?

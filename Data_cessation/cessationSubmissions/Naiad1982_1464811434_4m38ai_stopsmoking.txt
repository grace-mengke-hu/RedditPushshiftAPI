Day 4, feeling positive!

As advertised, I'm on day 4. I'm so determined this time. I've been cutting down for months and ended up at around 4 per day, but one of those was the minute I got out of bed, and I just thought to myself "that's so sad". Then I found this sub, browsed for a bit, and that was it! Thanks for all the inspiration, let's smash this thing!

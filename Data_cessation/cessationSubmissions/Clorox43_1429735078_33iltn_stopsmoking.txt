My mom just got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.

I guess I'm here in hopes that this will help some of you along with your smoke-free journey (and a little catharsis). 

My mom just got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. We knew she had a mass on her lung and now, after the biopsy, scans, the cancer review board unanimously said stage 4. With treatment, that means 1-2 years of living. My mom never thought it would happen to her. That smokers who got cancer were the exception, not the rule. I guess when you're young, you don't realize that with every cigarette you smoke, you are borrowing against your future. Every single cigarette is minutes of your life that you don't get to have with your grown up children or future grandkids or golden years with your spouse. And then one day your body goes to collect on that debt when it can't take any more abuse. 

I'm not even 30 and she's barely in her 60's. I guess I'm angry at my mom for every cigarette she smoked and I'm even angrier that I won't get to have more time with her. And I see this miserable and painful road ahead with hospitals and chemo and watching her deteriorate and I just feel sad and numb. 

If you care about the people in your life, please don't slowly kill yourself with cigarettes. I commend all of you for being here and trying to rid yourself of this awful addiction. If you fail the first time, second time, or even 50th time, please please please keep trying to quit.  

Edit: Thank you all for your well wishes. This is such an awesome community. I am rooting for all of you!

Help me, Please?

I have been trying to quit.  I was a smoker for about 10 years, quit for about 4 an about 2 years ago picked it back up.  I hate everything about smoking, the smell, the yellow fingernails, the taste and the addiction.

I want to quit.  And for the last month I have gone from a pack a day to 1-3 smokes a day, but I can't completely quit.  I have spent some days without any cigarettes at all.  But I find myself wanting one every minute of everyday.  I find I can't break the addiction this time.  

I am desperate and want to quit.  I have developed breathing problems and heart problems because of my smoking but I can't stop.  I need something to help me stop.  I read Allen Carr's book but I can't break the final addiction. 

Any advice on what I can do to help me finally break this addiction?

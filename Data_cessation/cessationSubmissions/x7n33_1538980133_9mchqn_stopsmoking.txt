Day 5 - totally freaking out

I’m on day 5 today and up until today it went better than expected but this morning it seems like all hell broke loose.

My body is aching, I’m very anxious/stressed at work feeling like I forgot something or just f*cked up.

Keep having a mind battle with myself to NOT have one (or a puff). 

Just wanted to type this and share as I’m alone in the office

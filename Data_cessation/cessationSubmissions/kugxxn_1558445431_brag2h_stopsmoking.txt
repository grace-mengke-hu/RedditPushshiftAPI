Quitting while suffering from Depression and Anxiety

i feel like trying to quit while being diagnosed with both conditions makes it much more challenging. part of me knows that i have to quit so my health improves, i can live longer with my loved ones and spend more money on them and myself instead of cigarettes but the other part of me feels like quitting would be pointless, no one loves you, you’re gonna end up all alone. i don’t mean to make things negative on here but just wondering if anyone feels the same way. i quit for a good 15 hours and it only took 1 bad event to get me to smoke 2 sticks. i’m starting my journey again. i’m not giving up just yet. i’ll keep trying until i succeed. i know you can’t avoid bad events from happening and i have to change the way i think. i have to do this for myself and the people i love

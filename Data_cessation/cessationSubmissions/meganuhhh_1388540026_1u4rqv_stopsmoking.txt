Me and everyone else.

As of midnight tonight I am NO LONGER a smoker. I told my mom and everything....so you know...disappointment and shit if I start again. Wish me luck! Motivation and tips are encouraged! 

Good luck to everyone else who's starting their quitting journey in 2014!

EDIT: It's 12:07 and I'm OFFICIALLY a NON-smoker! Happy new year to you all! I hope 2014 treats you ALL well!

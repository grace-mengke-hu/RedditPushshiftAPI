I’ve become one of “them”

The other day, just short of my 50 day mark, I was sitting outside having an iced coffee. A gentleman sat at a table near me and I saw he was about to light up, and I have to say I had a moment of panic… I “knew” from past quits, that the smell was going to be too much and was convincing myself that “you will not blow your progress and bum a smoke.”  Well, the smell reached me and was so offensive that I became one of those people who move away.  As I can’t judge, I didn’t make a big deal about it, but move I had to 😃

Not thinking about smoking at all among smokers...does this last?

Hey guys,

Just came to a realization thy 95% of the time I don't envy smokers. They look like normal people to me and I don't need to keep my guard so very high when interacting with them. 

My question is whether my perception is going to stick? Or that I will start envying smokers again depending on circumstances?

Thanks

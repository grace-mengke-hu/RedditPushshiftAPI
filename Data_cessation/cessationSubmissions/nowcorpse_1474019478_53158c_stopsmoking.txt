My dad is smoking again. Six months after his cardiac arrest.

He had a heart attack a few years ago, and a cardiac arrest six months back. He literally flatlined, the doctor declared him dead, and yet somehow he survived. He stopped smoking since that day.

Since yesterday, he is back at it again, and I don't know what to do. His near-death experience has made him very emotional and the smallest word hurts him.

He has begun spinning his web of lies all over again, and started living in denial once more. "I need to walk. I need to go get some milk. I need to meet a neighbor."

I'm completely lost. How do I help him, without hurting his feelings?

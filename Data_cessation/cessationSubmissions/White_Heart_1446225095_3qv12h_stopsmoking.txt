My neighbors are currently visiting me, the two of them smoked 3 cigarettes each, so far.

The thing is, I would have thought that in such a situation I would crave cigarettes. The truth of the matter is, the only two feelings I have right now are disgust because cigarettes smell **absolutely horrible**, and feeling sorry for these two young, good looking and well educated gentlemen, wasting their health away like that. 

I'm infinitely grateful for being a nonsmoker. 

Thank you all for helping me through this. I hope I don't blow it up this time.

Day 2. Thank you universe!

Yesterday, fruit juice and carrots carried me through Day 1 like a charm. Today I could not reinvent the magic. When my trigger points arrived, I swear I would have smoked, except I got locked in meetings I could not leave. I think the universe intervened to help. I'm fine now. Thank you universe!

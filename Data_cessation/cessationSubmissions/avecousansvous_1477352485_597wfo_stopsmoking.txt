Coughing up while running

So, this isn't my first time quitting, but I know it'll be my last. I quit around 3 weeks ago and I've been running since long before I quit smoking.

I know it's usual to cough up the tar in your lungs, but this time something different is going on: I only really cough up and have problems while running. Throughout the day I'm completely fine, no problems, but while I run I have to constantly clear my throat or cough up and it's really slowing me down. Anyone faced this before? Anyone know how long this is going to last for?

Time to give this a real try

I’ve been smoking around 10 a day for over a year now. I never thought I’d become a full time smoker but the initial buzz and enjoyment has long gone and I don’t enjoy it anymore. Waking up in a morning and craving a cigarette and going to sleep thinking about it isn’t what I want to do anymore. I had my last cigarette yesterday, which I really didn’t enjoy and I knew it was time to cut it out. I’ve got a good support system around me and I know I can do this. 

Got myself some patches, put my first one on this morning. Makes my arm hurt a bit like I’ve been punched but I’ve looked this up and other people seem to get similar side effects. I’d have usually had 1-2 cigarettes so far and I don’t even feel like smoking so far but I know it’s gonna be a hard few weeks. 

I’ve also downloaded the Allen Carr audiobook from audible, listened to the first chapter this morning and I’m really enjoying it. 

Wish me luck! I’ve got this... I hope!

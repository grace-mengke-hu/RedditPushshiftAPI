50 Days!

I haven't been coming on here much lately but decided to check my counter and I was happy to see it's been 50 days since I last had a cigarette.
In the past, I knew that my triggers were both stress (having a lot to do) and boredom (having not enough to do). I've now made it through the finals period in law school and most of winter vacation without having a cigarette or even really wanting one for the last few weeks.

After being a smoker for 16 years. I feel like a non-smoker.

50 days!

phlegm - craving relation

i've realized something recently which my scientific brain rejects to accept but i cant help thinking the same thing nevertheless. whenever i suffer large amount of phlegm a mild craving follows. I am at work drinking coffee . I've never had a craving before during this time of the day. today i woke up with awful phlegm which tasted and smell equally awful and now i am hit by a craving. has anyone ever experienced such thing ?

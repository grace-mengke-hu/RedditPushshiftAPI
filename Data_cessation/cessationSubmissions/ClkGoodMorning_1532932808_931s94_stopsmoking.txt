Attempt 2 sabotaged

Started on attempt 2 to quit smoking, fix my brothers scooter, the ONE TIME he actually "pays me" is with what...but a pack of ciggerettes...fucking A bro, fucking A. 
I guess I should tell friends &amp; family but I don't want the guilt of if I slip up.

Side note: my method of quitting cigs is quite interesting? I get a pack, find some homies, get blitzed smoke/hand out all my cigs, next day I'm hungover, feeling like shit and I don't buy another pack, usually helps keep the cravings at bay for a day or 2 then proceed with my quit plan. Worked for 7 days then the anxieties of life caught up with me (yay co parenting!) If anyone has advice to deal with anxiety of parenting/money let me know. Thanks!

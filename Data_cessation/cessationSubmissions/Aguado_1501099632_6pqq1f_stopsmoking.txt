Day 33 of being a non-smoker

Yes, I'm vaping but I feel so much better not smoking cigs. It's so nice not having to light up after every meal, any alcohol, social gatherings, etc... 

I'm quitting while my SO continues to smoke. She can't seem to put them down which in turn tempts me at times.

Strange thing is I've had zero cravings to buy a pack or smoke any of hers this entire time. I believe I've finally kicked the habit this time :D

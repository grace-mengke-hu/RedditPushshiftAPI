2 days in to being smoke free and my chest is aching.

Some background: I've only ever been a light smoker, maybe 2 a day for 5 or so days a week. Never had more than 3 in a day. I've been a smoker for around a year. I'm now 18. 2 days ago I decided to quit after reminiscing the idea of it for some time. It's now Monday and my chest is feeling tight and a strange pressure feeling on the bottom left of my chest. It's horrible and won't really go away for more than a minute at a time. Is this normal??

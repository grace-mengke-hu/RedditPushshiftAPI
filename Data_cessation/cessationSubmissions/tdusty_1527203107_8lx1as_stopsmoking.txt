9 hours 39 minutes

Hi all I want to thank you so much , I know that 9 hours and 39 minutes is nothing special but honestly it’s been so incredibly difficult and reading your posts is the only thing that has gotten me this far . 

I have no idea why this time I’m having so much trouble I would say I have a 10/10 craving every 1 hour at work today . I fought it and I read one of your stories every time I got a craving and I made it through! 

I found myself having mini arguments inside my head that I wasn’t even aware were happening .. my brain was telling me “ hey” “what’s up “ “ it’s break time ... I think mike will give you a cig and you won’t have to buy a pack..” no !! No!! And I know he would but I didn’t do it. Honest confession I did go sit next to him just to smell it but I did not take one puff ! 

My last cig was at 6:15 am this morning and then I set the timer on my smoke free app . If I make it until 6:15 am tomorow it will be my first full 24hrs in ten years 10 years!! Without a smoke . I’m so scared I will screw this up , more than anything i want to hit this 24 hr milestone . I have no idea what difficulty I will see after that because I’ve never made it that far but I need this 24hr milestone so badly . 

I hope to reply to this tomorow to let you all know that I made it

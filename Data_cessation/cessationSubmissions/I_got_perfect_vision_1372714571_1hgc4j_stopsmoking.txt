Day 13 and it just isn't getting any easier

Not really looking for any advice so much as the timelines it took for people to stop feeling shitty in the old brainbox.  I'm not terribly worried about relapsing yet, I'm just tired of arguing with myself all day about smoking.  I've read that the third day is the hardest but I think the second week has been much more difficult than the first one.  Anybody else have that problem?

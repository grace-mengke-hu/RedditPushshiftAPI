Fell off the wagon a few months back. Trying again.

So I quit a while back. One of my big goals was to improve my run. A couple weeks into quitting, I broke my foot, and fell off soon after.

Now I'm healed, and currently training for a half marathon. I had my last cigarette at noon today. For those interested, I'm using patches and Wellbutrin.

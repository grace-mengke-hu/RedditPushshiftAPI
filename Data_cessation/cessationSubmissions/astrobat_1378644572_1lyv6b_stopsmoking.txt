harming my quit by using a 0 nicotine ecig?

This is my third attempt at quitting. My first quit was using the gum and it lasted just a few months. My second was via cold turkey and lasted about 10 months until I just started smoking again this past February. I quit again this past wednesday cold turkey, for good. 

After a movie and drinks last night with my husband I sort of broke down, the irritability and anxiety of quitting had finally caught up with me I guess. I was crying and bawling over the tiniest reason-I wasn't sad or angry I just couldn't keep myself from crying. I wanted a cigarette so bad, but knew I couldn't have one.  

We ended up stopping at three convenience stores on the way home until I found a 0 nicotine e-cig. It'd didn't help with the chemical withdrawal (no familiar nicotine buzz to the head) but it did sort of act as a pacifier, I was able to stop crying, lol. Now I am just very concerned that I have somehow polluted my quit. I puffed on that thing for an hour last night until I was calm enough to go to bed. 

Are there other additives in e-cigs? Even though my 0% njoy says 0% is there still some trace amount, much like a non alchoholic beer has a trace amount? Did I just give myself some other chemical or habit to hold on to? Will inhaling the vapors hinder my body from flushing out all the cigarette toxins and tar from my lungs? I want to get over the physical affects of quitting asap and don't want to slow down the detox. 

tldr: quit cold turkey, has a freak out, bought 0 nicotine ecig, worried it will mess up my quit.

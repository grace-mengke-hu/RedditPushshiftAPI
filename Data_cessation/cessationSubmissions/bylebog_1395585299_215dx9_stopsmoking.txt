Twas the night before quitting.

Wife and I had quit for a few months before we got married. Then during planning decided to "have one, we're stressed. We don't have to start again.!" So, nearly 3 years later... I'll be a non smoker in 16 hours and 28 minutes

I remember last time the worst trigger for cravings was my morning coffee. This will hurt, any suggestions? I live in Central Oregon. Giving up coffee is like giving up all the local breweries that I've come to love in the short time I've lived here.

Resources to help quit smoking?

Hey guys, a friend of mine told me he wants to quit smoking and I know I've seen lots of resources around to help with that kind of thing (nicotine patches and gum), but I don't know what actually works and what is most effective. If there's already a wiki or post for quality resources I'd take a link to that.

Difficulty breathing when quitting?

I stopped smoking two days ago (ignore the badge, I also tried quitting a while ago then unsubscribed and forgot about it) and after approximately 24 hours without a cigarette had clocked over I felt an alarming tightness in my throat. It's been almost another 24 hours since then and this hasn't gone away and has spread to my chest, making it impossible to run and difficult to walk a significant distance or concentrate on anything else. Is this normal or should I be concerned about my health? I never experienced anything like this when I was smoking but on the other occasions when I tried to quit (normally only lasting a day or two) I experienced the same symptoms. I really want to break the habit now but this is making it very difficult, I feel like I'm suffocating.

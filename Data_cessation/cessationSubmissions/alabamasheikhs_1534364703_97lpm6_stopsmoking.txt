Day 1- Quit on a day where in in theory I’d need it most. Keeping it real.

So I threw all my cigs away at 3 in the morning in the paper trash. Couldn’t sleep till 6.30 AM. Went to sleep somehow and woke up at 10 AM. The first thing I did everyday until yesterday right after waking up was to go downstairs, get a coffee and smoke a cigarette or two. Not happening today so stayed in bed for a good two hours to beat the craving.


Today evening is my Masters program’s end of year review by the way- everything that I’ve worked hard for boils down to this day. And I found out that my program’s Head is already waiting to ask me some grilling questions (long story for another day).

So when I realised I was wasting time lying in bed and craving a smoke instead of preparing my presentation, I almost gave in. I just needed to smoke one, get it over with and begin my day. I went back to the trash can and started rummaging through the paper waste for cigarettes. But as it turns out, the past-me had broken every cigarette in the bud last night (it made me so pissed off at myself and at the same time admire myself, like, wow- I did that?). So the present-not-so-inspirational me took a little broken cig butt out, put it between my lips (as sexual borderline creepy as that sounds) and started walking around the house pretending I was smoking. Funnily enough the mere action and smell of the raw butt brought the craving down somewhat, and more miraculously, made me want to take a shit.

So here I am, holding on. Going down to the vending machine to get me a pack of chips. Wish me luck for today’s presentation.

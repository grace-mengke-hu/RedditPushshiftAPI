9th day without cigarettes

I havenâ€™t smoked cigs for nine days and before that 2 days with one cigarette. Feeling already better but could you guys handle me some tips what to do when anxiety kicks in and I do want to get that away without smoking? Because that idgaf attitude is a strong relapsing power for me.. 

Maybe bubblegum or some new habit?

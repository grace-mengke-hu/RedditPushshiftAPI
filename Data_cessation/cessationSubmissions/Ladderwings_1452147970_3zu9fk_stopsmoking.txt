My last cigarette is a 830 tonight (NZ time). Any suggestions to help me get through this?

I started smoking because my anxiety and depression got really bad and it was my way to stop and focus on something else. But now, I've decided I'm strong enough to quit. I've ordered a non-nicotine e-cigarette to help my oral fixation.

Any pointers? Is the three day hump real? Anything I can do to ease this? I have only been smoking for 7 months, but I've been smoking almost a pack a day since I've started. 

Time to get back to my running, so help please!!! :)

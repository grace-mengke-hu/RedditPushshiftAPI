It is well about time

So i need to stop smoking. I understand that if i am able to quit this addiction, it will empower me to quit/ turn away from other addictions and build my will power. I am extremely disappointed at my poor will power right now. Tied into this, it has been difficult getting over my ex gf (been over 11 months now). Everytime i smoke (15  a day), i remember her because we used to smoke together. SO all in all, with the memories of the ex and the disappointment of smoking, things get miserable. Reliving memories of ex girlfriends in itself is an addiction. 
So i plan on achieving a healthier mind and healthier body by quitting. I appreciate all the support!

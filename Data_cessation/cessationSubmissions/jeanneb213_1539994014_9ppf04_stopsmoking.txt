Losing it but still winning

I’m on day 18 and I feel like an alien. Totally off my game, lots of anxiety. It’s amazing I survived this week at work. Grateful to have made it to the weekend. I do appreciate all the posts here so I don’t feel so alone. It’s not like you can talk about this in real life like you can here with so many other people hanging on who understand. I’ll get through it but I’m hoping for some semblance of normalcy soon.

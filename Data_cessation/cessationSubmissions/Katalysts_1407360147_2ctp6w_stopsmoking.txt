**According to myself I have improved in the following ways:**

* Singing: can hold notes easier and huge improvement in range
* I can smell things so much better and it makes things a lot more enjoyable (who knew my conditioner smelled *that* good?)
* Instead of going outside to smoke I now play with a hula hoop I bought. I'm getting... better, lol.
* There is now no one in my immediate family who smokes and my little brother is very proud of me

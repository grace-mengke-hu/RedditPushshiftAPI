To hell with it, here goes.

Ok this habit has got to stop.

I was doing pretty well earlier this year, then some shit hit the fan pretty hard and well, relapsed.

It's been 16 hours since my last smoke, although I am cheating a little with an e-cig (low nicotine content) for the time being, but at least I'm not filling my lungs with more tar and coughing like I'm about to die.

Evening of the first day, rest of life remains!

Wish me luck!

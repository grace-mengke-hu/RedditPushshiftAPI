Close to one week...BUT it's Friday Night and I'm having Terrible Cravings

Friday night is hangout time with the boys, all of whom smoke.  To top it off, I can't shake the feeling of a cigarette on a Friday night after a long week of work.  If I go in tonight without one, I'll here guff from my friends, and still be craving.  Anyone have any advice to offer??

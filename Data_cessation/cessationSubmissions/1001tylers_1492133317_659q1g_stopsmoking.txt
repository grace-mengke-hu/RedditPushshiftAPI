Life Sucks Hard Today

So I'm just finishing up day 3 without the disgusting dried brown herb.

Anyway, all I could think about all day is how old I am and that I'm working a dead end job and that my family abandoned me and left me completely fucked in life 

and how im never going to amount to anything and that the system makes it impossible for me to get ahead...

etc. etc.

It's just negative thought after negative thought

Normally when I feel like this...I have a smoke or a drink.

But sincr I can't do that anymore I just keep taking naps.and waiting for this feeling to go away.

MAKE IT STOP ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢

Almost 3 weeks, struggling.

Hey everyone,

So 3 weeks is coming around surprisingly quickly and without too much stress, but I am now noticing something that is starting to take a toll on my mind.

I have been a drummer for about a year and a half, and while practicing I very often get right into it and wear myself out by being an incredibly emotive drummer (Looking like a moron, swinging my arms around and headbanging).

While I was smoking, I would often get worn out quickly and immediately knew why.
However, now I've quit and been off for nearly 3 weeks - I'm noticing that my lung capacity and ability to stay active behind the kit is actually less than that of when I was smoking. I'm pretty sure it's my lungs starting to clear off the extra tar and crap that has been coated on them, but it's incredibly frustrating that I am feeling worse now I've quit than when I was a smoker.

Obviously I'm not going to take it up again, but has anyone else noticed this inability to catch a full breath and feel like they're constantly heavy chested as their lungs get rid of all the excess muck? Very frustrating that I feel like I should be able to perform better without smoking, but am finding the opposite..

Cheers everyone, best of luck to you all as always.

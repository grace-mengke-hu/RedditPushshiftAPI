11 weeks pregnant and I just quit smoking.

This is unbelievably hard. Of course doctors, my husband, my parents, and friends have been drilling it in me that I needed to quit. I know it is what's best, but the addict in me is persistent and stubborn. 

After reading a lot on the subject of smoking and pregnancy, I found that the general consensus is to quit before 12 weeks - when the fetus develops it's lungs (of course, the sooner the better!). I had been tapering down (going from about 15 or so a day to 3), thinking this would make it easier. The result of course is that my addiction is speaking through me to say "you can still smoke 1 or 2 a day, it's fine!" The multitude of other excuses my brain is coming up with is astounding: "my birth mother smoked with me and I turned out fine" (I'm adopted), "countless friends have smoked during their pregnancies and their kids are fine", to "I'll just hide it from my husband."

Ultimately, I know I can't do this to my unborn child, or to myself anymore. With the million and one worries that go along with pregnancy, and ultimately parenthood, why subject myself to *adding* to that worry?! I've already had some scares in this pregnancy, which may or may not even be related to being a smoker. I'm technically supposed to be on bed rest (no exercise, lifting, or sex) so that aspect makes it a bit harder to have stuff to distract me with, but NO MORE EXCUSES... Just do this! 

Anyone's words will be appreciated (even if you choose to berate me). Maybe there's some literature that's specific to smoking and pregnancy someone can recommend? And of course, best of luck to all my fellow quitters!

Today I have quit smoking.

I have never been a pack a day smoker. The most I have in a day is frequently 4 cigs. But enough is enough. It's a stupid habit. Doesn't even relieve any kind of stress any more. 

But I think the key to quitting is to find the association I make with it. When is the urge strongest? that is what i must find. 

I will post in seven days again. I hope i make it through this time round. 

Wish me luck brothers and sisters.

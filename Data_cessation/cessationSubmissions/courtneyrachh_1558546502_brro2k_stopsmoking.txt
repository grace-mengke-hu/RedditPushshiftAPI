more advice for cravings?!

I am having the worst worst WORST cravings today.

I've tried everything, drinking water, distracting myself, setting a timer, walking around, everything I normally do, but the thought of one just isn't going away.

I'm over a week without one, and there hasn't been a day that they've been this bad. i know if i cave i'll be super disappointed and feel guilty later, but for some reason that isn't enough to get me to stop thinking about one.

any advice would be greatly appreciated!

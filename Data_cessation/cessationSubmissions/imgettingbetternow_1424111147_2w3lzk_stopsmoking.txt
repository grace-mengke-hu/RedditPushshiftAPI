Prevailing, but struggling

A little over three weeks in. I've had a beer with out succombing. I've had a coffee each morning and strayed from lighting up as was my usual routine in my life as a smoker. I've had dreams of falling of the wagon and felt the disappointment wash over me as I realize what I've done just to awaken to a strong sense of accomplishment and pride of being x consecutive days strong. 

But several times a day, I think to myself "I need a cig." It just creeps up from the depths of my mind. And then the craving sets in for a few minutes. 

I don't want my brain to betray me like that. I'm battling each craving and I'm living the life of a non smoker and I'm proud to have gotten this far but the fact that after everything my brain still says "I NEED a cigarette right now" worries me.

When will that not become first nature?

Thank you all for your help.

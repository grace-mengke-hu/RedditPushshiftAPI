It's time! But I need advice.

I'm ready to give up this nasty habit once and for all. But I have a problem that makes it harder on me. 

I work in a casino, so for eight hours a day I'm walking around and seeing probably seventy-five percent of the customers smoking, not to mention breathing it in, smelling it, and all of my coworkers that smoke. Anyone have any advice for me on how to resist the urges when I'm constantly around smoking?

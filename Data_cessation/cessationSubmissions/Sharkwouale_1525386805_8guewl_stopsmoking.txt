How can I support my mother to quit smoking?

Hello, 
I don't know what to do, so I'm asking for your help.

My mother is about to quit smoking.
She is 57 years old and she smokes since she was like 12.

It is the first time ever that she will give it a try. (she don't have any choices left, since her doctor wont removes the things she has in the throat if she don't quit smooking)
We know that it will be rough, especially because she literally stop travelling when they forbid cigarettes on airplanes, because she wasnt able to pass through a full 5 hours without smoking... Before that, she was going to one destination per year.

So the anxiety level she is experiencing without nicotine must be sky high for her... 

She'll have patches and a spray to provide her some nicotine during the process. But she did use the spray thing to survive her last flight on a plane, and it was a total nightmare. So I really don't know if theses things will be helpful to keep her anxiety at bay at all...

My question is, what can we do as an external person to help her to pass through this withdrawal anxiety issue?
If anyones have tricks or idea to make this whole process easier for her... I'm not sure what I can do, but I would like to help her as much as possible.

Thank you :)

TL;DR: My mother is going to try to quit smoking, I would like to be as helpful as possible to her in that process but don't know exactly how.

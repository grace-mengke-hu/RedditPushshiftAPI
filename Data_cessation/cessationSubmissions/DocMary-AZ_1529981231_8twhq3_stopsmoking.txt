Will my son quit too?

I am 66, smoked since age 14 (yes, over 50 yrs). My adult son (40) visited me in AZ last week for a few days while on business trip in LA.  
I was suddenly struck with guilt watching him smoke. Yes, bad, bad selfish mom abd role model. 
He left back to MI on the 20th and I have not had a cigarette since (5 days). 
Haven't  told him (or anyone) yet.  I want to be at least 2-3 weeks smoke free in hopes he'll look up to his ol mom and quit too. He has talked about it. Never too late to make changes, whether a 50 yr habit or 10 yrs.
It has been so very difficult (cravings, bitchy, tired, . .). I read Carr's book, several articles, using Quit Now app. Wish me luck. I wish all of you the same.
Going for day 6 in a few hours. Thank God I live alone, if you know what I mean . . .LOL

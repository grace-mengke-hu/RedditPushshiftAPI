I found a pack

I have been doing so good. And today I was trying to find something in one of the drawers and I found an entire new pack of cigs. What do I do? I stopped smoking because I thought I had finished my carton. But I guess I must of hid this for emergencies or something. Now I dont feel the need to smoke it because I dont want to go through the withdrawal again. But should I keep the pack? Or through it away? Its $15 

Edit: Thank you for all the advice everyone. I ended up throwing them away and had to take the trash all the way out. It was definitely in the back of my head when it was here. It did throw me off my game today unfortunately :(

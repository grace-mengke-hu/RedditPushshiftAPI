Three days since a stress stick.

So I’m on chantix and I’m three days into not smoking. The chantix side effects don’t really bother me and I got it for free with my health insurance if anyone is thinking about it. The dreams do feel real but I haven’t had nightmares so nothing awful.

Tonight I really want a damn cigarette. I know I can go get some, and then just start again tomorrow but that would just have to make me do this process all over again...AND the chantix blocks me from expierenckng the nicotine buzz so kind of pointless. BUT I REALLY WANT ONE. 

Worst part is that I think well I can go have a beer but that would probably make me want to smoke more. Do these cravings ever completely go away?

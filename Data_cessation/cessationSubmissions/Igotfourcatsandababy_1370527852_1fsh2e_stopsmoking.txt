Done and done

I got a full scholarship at a D1 college to run track. My junior year I was ranked 50th in the USA for the 400 meter dash. Once my racing career was over, I focused on my music career. Hanging out at bars, drinking, and smoking were all a part of being a musician, or so I thought. I got hooked and now I feel ashamed at how winded I am going up a flight of stairs, considering just 3 years ago I could sprint all out for a quarter of a mile and pose for a picture at the end. 

Done with this. No more cigarettes.

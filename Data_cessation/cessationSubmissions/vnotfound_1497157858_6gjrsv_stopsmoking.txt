Did I really quit?

So I officially stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes quite a while ago. But since I stopped I've done the following:

* Smoked a few blunts, knowing that the blunt itself is made of refined tobacco.

* Put tobacco in joints. It's a thing in my country. You grind the kush, you sprinkle tobacco from a cigarette on it, mix it and put everything in the joint. It's literally smoking tobacco from a cigarette, it's just very little, but it's there.

* Took drags from an e-cig, which put nicotine in my system again I believe.

* Bought a pack of cigs. Only did it to sprinkle tobacco on my joints and I never put a tobacco only cig in my mouth, but it's one of the things that define a smoker I think. Also bought an ash tray and a lighter. Lots of joints lol...

So... I haven't put a tobacco only cigarette in my mouth since I quit, but of all the things that define a regular smoker I've done everything short of taking a drag. What do you guys think? How do you define a smoker?

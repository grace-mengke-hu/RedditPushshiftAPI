Trying to help my dad quit

So my dad quit cigarettes about 8 months ago when I bought him a vape, and over time I brought down the nic in the vape juice and he's finally on 0 nic. Now I'm in a place where I'm asking myself "do I need to get him to quit the vape? Or is it safe enough that he can just keep going with it. Most of the info I find on the internet is super conflicting and my dad's family has no history of cancer but a long history if heart disease so I'm really happy he's off the nic but I'm not sure how bad the stuff in the vape is for his lungs. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read an answer I really do appreciate it.

My body is forcing me to quit

A couple of weeks ago I came home after a long weekend in Portland where I spent a lot of time smoking and drinking. When I came home I had a bit of a cold and sore throat so I didn't smoke for a few days. The cold went away, the sore throat didn't. I looked in my mouth a few days ago and there were these weird bumps all over the back of my tongue. Turns out my taste buds are irritated and swollen from smoking too much, and the only way they'll go back to normal is if I stop smoking. I had a half of a cigarette yesterday and threw the rest of my pack and all tobacco products out. I'm really hoping I can stay quit this time.

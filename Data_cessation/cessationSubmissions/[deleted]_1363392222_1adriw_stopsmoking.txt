Day one... again.

I've smoked on and off for over ten years and quit several times. I now smoke weekends only (mostly) and I want to give up for good. It's Saturday morning and I'm hoping to get through my first weekend without. I'll let you know how I go! 

PS - congratulations to all of you for doing so well, regardless of how far along you are :)

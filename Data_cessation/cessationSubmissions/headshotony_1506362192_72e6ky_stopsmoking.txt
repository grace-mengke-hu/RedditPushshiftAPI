What to do when all my friends are smoking?

Hi, I started smoking more frequently about 6 months ago during the exams. I started because I usually study in college with my friends, and when they took a break to smoke I went along with them. I don't smoke alone (yet I guess), I smoke to stay entertained for those 5 minutes or so where all my friends are smoking. 
Can you suggest something to keep me busy while everyone is smoking? Thank you

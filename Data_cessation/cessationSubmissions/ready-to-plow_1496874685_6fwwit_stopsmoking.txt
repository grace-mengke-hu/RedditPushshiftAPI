Can't control my emotions, lack of focus, even after 2 weeks

Hello! I have quit smoking about 2 weeks ago, and ever since I have been feeling extremely "off". I thought that after two weeks it would get better, but today I had unexplained fits of rage and just generally couldn't control my emotions. I'm wondering if this is normal and if emotions eventually normalize? Most timelines suggest that withdrawal symptoms get better after 3-4 days, but it seems to me that I might be stuck in this maladaptive emotional state and it is not getting any better. Also lack of focus, concentration and fatigue aren't getting any better. Is this normal at all (for longer than 2 weeks)? Anyone went through something similar? Thanks in advance.

New Redditer -needing help to quit.

Whist I have hidden in the background this is the first time I've had the courage to post anything. I've never even publicly commented before. The reason for my recent courage? Quitting smoking is making me crazy. I need help. I am almost 31 years old and have smoked consistently since I was 17. Smoking feels like my best friend and worst enemy. The thing that has always been there for me and the thing that will kill me. Without smoking it seems like everything else that is negative in my life is amplified.  Any tips, tricks or words of wisdom that you can share would be welcomed as the anxiety and physical withdrawals are making it hard to stay committed and it's only 12 hours since I quit. Thanks in advance

If you're so afraid of dying, why are you trying to kill yourself?

I'm going through a quarter life crisis I guess. The whole "what will the rest of my life be like? What happens when we die? Will I leave a legacy?" Weird, intrusive, anxiety type stuff. The thought of death and dying is a huge hurdle for me and I just realized that smoking will make my worst fears come true. Inevitably. I WILL die if I smoke. The cancer risk from my moms side is so astronomically high I will be surprised if I don't have it by 60. 

***It is*** a proven fact it will kill you in various ugly ways. I'm not going to be responsible for doing that to myself. It is a choice to do those horrible things to myself and now, I am choosing *not* to do it.

I will tell this story one day of how I was sick and laying in bed for 3 days when I decided to never smoke again. Didn't have another from that point on. 

That will make a good story.

I need to look to the future. I'm not going to track the days. I'm just going to do it. When people will inevitably ask me how long I've gone without a cigarette, I will just reply "The rest of my life"

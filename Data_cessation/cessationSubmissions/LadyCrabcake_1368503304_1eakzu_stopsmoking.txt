The Bright Side of the Flu

I finally quit.  Mainly because I ached too much to move, let alone navigate stairs and walk outside to smoke, for 2 days.  Not recommending flu as a strategy, clearly, but every hour I didn't smoke as usual helped me get another step away.  (Might as well multitask misery.)  It's still so hard at times....other times, I realize I haven't thought about it at all for an hour.  Then two hours.  It's getting better.  Lurking here helps--thank you for being here, y'all.

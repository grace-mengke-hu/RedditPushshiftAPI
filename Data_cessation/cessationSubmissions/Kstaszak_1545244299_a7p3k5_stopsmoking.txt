Help

So, I'm not getting cravings per say, but just miss cigarettes like it's a part of who I was.... the younger, care free me... how does one wrap their head around getting older and being a more reaponsible adult?  Like what are the perks of getting older? I'm having a hard time believing that getting older is better?  I'm only 33, but both my parents died before age 50 so in my mind.... I'm old already. I'm not having any health issues other then tight muscles.  I do well without smoking during the week,  then the weekend comes and I'm wanting fun, and that always has been a few drinks and a pack of smokes.  Can anyone shed some light on this?

Monday, Monday, Monday!

All -

I am reaching out because I need your help. My set quit date is Monday and I am scared. Cigarettes have been companion since I was 18. They were there when I was an anxious teenager in love. They were there when I was in war zones. They greeted me after sex and meals. They were a part of my bar routine. They welcomed the morning with me each day. After a long run, I am dripping in sweat, breathing hard, and they were there to calm me down, relax me and get my heart pumping at a normal rate again. They have been there for me I. Every situation. 

But they’re also hurting me. I find that my run time has significantly decreased and part of the reasons is smoking. I want to quit. It is a challenge I welcome. But I don’t know how to make myself not give up quitting. Help me start and stay on track please.

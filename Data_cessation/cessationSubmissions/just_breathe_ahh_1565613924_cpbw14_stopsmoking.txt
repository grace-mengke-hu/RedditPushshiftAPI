Tempted myself on purpose

I’m 2 weeks free and I went to the pool yesterday. Only had 1 beer instead of 6 that I would’ve had if I was smoking. When my friend went to the smoking area to have a cig I went with her and it didn’t bother me. Instead of thinking about her cig I read Alan Carr aloud to her.

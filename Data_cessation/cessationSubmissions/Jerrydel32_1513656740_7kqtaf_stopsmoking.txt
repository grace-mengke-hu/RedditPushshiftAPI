Need advice

Tonight I am going to bed as a smoker and I would like to wake up as a former smoker. I always tell myself that I will not smoke tomorrow, and then I wake up, make coffee and immediately go outside. I do well not smoking when they are not around me, but my wife is also a smoker and doesn’t intend on quitting. My self control, when it comes to not smoking, is nonexistent. Has anyone experienced quitting with another smoker in the house? How have you done it? I have kids, I’ve had a close loved one that died of cancer, I smell like an ashtray and I hate it. I have a physically active hobby that I thought would motivate me to quit, but it hasn’t helped. What do I do?

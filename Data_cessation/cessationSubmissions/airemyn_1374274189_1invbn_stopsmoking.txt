I've noticed quite a bit of this going on in here...

...just zipping on by a milestone and not even noticing! 

When I quit before, I remember looking at an iPhone app that I had forgotten about and being shocked that a year had passed and I'd completely forgotten about smoking.  Now I know I've only racked up 30+ days this go-round, but that's the most I've been able to string together for quite some time.  

As much as I believe in celebrating and honoring our accomplishments, it's kind of cool to realize that I think about smoking so little now that I didn't even notice another marker had gone by. 

Keep on stopping,

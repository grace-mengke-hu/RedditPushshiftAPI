Been smoking for 6 months. If I quit now will my skin still get wrinkly?

If my skin is still gonna get wrinkly, I'm just gonna say fuck it. Also, is it true that your heart will feel better? I'm really scared of having a heart attack. Not due to smoking, but just in general. I don't wanna die of a heart attack.

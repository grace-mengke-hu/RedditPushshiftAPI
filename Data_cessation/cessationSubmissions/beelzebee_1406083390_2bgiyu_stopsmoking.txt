I won the poker tournament!

Every week I play in a small hold 'em tourney and everybody smokes and drinks like chimneys. Well, I won and I didn't smoke any cigarettes. But I did drink like a chimney. (And I didn't smoke any drunken cigarettes!)

My flair says "5 days" but actually I just killed day 6.

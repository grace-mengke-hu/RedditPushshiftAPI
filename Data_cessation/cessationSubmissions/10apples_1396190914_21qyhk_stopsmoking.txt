im a bit on edge..

my sister came today and she forgot a cigarette. i want to smoke it but i know that it isn't really good for me and that there is no reason to waste my progress for few minutes of "pleasure" (who knows would it be pleasure, maybe i would hate the taste). i made pros and cons list and have 3pros and 15cons.. but i still feel the temptation.. 

EDIT: soon after writing the post i called my BF and he made me toss that cigarette away so instead of smoking i went for a run. when i came home i ate bunch of strawberries and now i feel proud of myself :)

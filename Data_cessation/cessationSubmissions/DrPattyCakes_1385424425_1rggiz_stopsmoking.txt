I QUIT! Fourth time's the charm - Day 1 again

Ok guys, I've been a smoker for about 10 years, during this time I quit 3 times.
First time I quit it was because a doctor offered me Champix. Worked for 1 month then I stopped taking it against the doc's orders. I didn't like the dreams it gave me

Second time I quit because I read the Allen Carr book. It worked for 9 months! It was great! Started again because I changed job and I felt stress. The cigarette didn't help. It just addicted me again.

Third time I quit (COLD TURKEY)  because my non smoker friend made a remark that I smoked too much. That lasted 7 months (COLD TURKEY)


FOURTH TIME! - This is it! I feel it.
My dad has COPD, emphysema, and pneumonia. He is not doing well, and we both know that one day this will take him.
I've been smoking about 2 packs a day for the last month, and finally after seeing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6txNNPKA8
I started feeling gross after smoking cigarettes, had a panic attack thinking of it, and started to "feel" my lungs go down. I feel it now, I finally started feeling crappy from smoking cigarettes.
This is it. I'm done.
I threw out TWO FULL CARTONS and then a few packs of cigarettes.





How day one feels:
Some times I feel like I *NEED* a cigarette until I realise I just kinda *want* one, but after thinking of it for a while, I ask myself "am I suffering because of this lack of smoking?" The answer was no. I wasn't even truly uncomfortable, I was just wanting.
I just have to say no to that little kid inside me that REALLY wants that candy bar. 
In other words, it's been way easier than I thought.

Oh, and for the record, I'm drinking beer :D Normally it makes me want to drink, forget it - I'm doing hard mode! Come at me bro!

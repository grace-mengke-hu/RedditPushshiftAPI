It has completely taken over my life and I don't know how to stop

I've been smoking for 10 years now. I smoke about 6 to 7 smokes a day. The only time I have quit was when I was pregnant with my son who is now 2. I hide and lie because of it. I am constantly guilty because of it. My husband considers it a deal breaker and yet I find new ways to do it without him finding out and become defensive when he finds out sooner or later.
I hate the person i have become with no regard or feeling to anybody and its eating away at me that it now includes my son.
I don't know how to stop. Please help

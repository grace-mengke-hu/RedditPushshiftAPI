Day 22 Thank you all!!

My Smoke Free app told me to do this last week but truthfully I still felt a little like I'm faking.
I started smoking when I was 13yrs old and continued pretty much uninterrupted for 25yrs. This is my first genuine attempt to give up. These past 22 days have been okay mainly because of you guys and this sub. 
I've always felt like I was suffering more than most during my previous half hearted attempts (typical addict!!!) and it's only by reading your stories that I realised Im absolutely no different to anyone else quitting. The relief was huge and has made dealing with the cravings (and the "mind games"as one member described it) so much easier .  So when the addict part of my brain starts yelling, my mantra has been "you're being ridiculous, stop it!". And it working.
To those who are ahead of me in their journey, you give me something to aspire to and comfort that I won't always feel sad, angry, tired etc. That what I'm going through is just a stage and it passes. Can't express how important that has been and still is during this journey.
And to those who are in the early stages, you guys make me realise how far I've come already and that it's getting easier. And it will get easier for you guys too.
To those who have had to "reset", you have highlighted the pitfalls and danger zones. 
So I say again THANK YOU ALL.

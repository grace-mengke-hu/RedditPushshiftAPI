Need some advice..

So I officially quit 51 days ago. 13 days in I got really drunk and smoked 1 american spirit(i've always hated them, but because of that i justified smoking just one). Felt absolutely terrible about the next day and then went 35 days without anything. Saturday night was my best friends birthday and I once again got very intoxicated and made the decision to smoke 1 black n mild. Once again I mentally felt terrible the next but also physically because we all know how much worse smoking makes hangovers. Now I know the quick answer would be to stop drinking like that, but that is some what unfeasible. I am sitting here today not wanting to smoke whatsoever but at the same time I have a ton of remorse about the cigar I smoked. I really don't want to reset my badge because it keeps making me feel that I am going back to square one. What should I do? 

EDIT: I could care less about the badge. It's the symbolism.

I want this time to be different,

I’ve had two quits. Both used vaping to hold me off. Once was two months and the other was a year and a half. A bad breakup sent me spiraling into my pack a day addiction again.

I’m 31 and already missed my goal of stopping before 30 which is a major blow to my confidence. 

I’ve been ruminating for months and semi-planning for weeks with the last few days being the strongest urge to stop.

There’s just so much wrong with smoking that my brain can’t seem to reconcile that bad with whatever percieved good my mind comes up with.

It’s partially been a coping mechanism for depression but honestly it just makes it so much worse. Nicotine saps me of energy, fogs my mind and makes procrastination so much easier to reach for.

I have a few cigarettes left and tonight I am determined to quit for good this time.

I’d appreciate any tips.

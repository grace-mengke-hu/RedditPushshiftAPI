Need some advice on quitting

Full disclosure, I'm not a smoker myself, but my mother has expressed that she'd like to quit and asked me to help her find the best method to stop. 

She has been smoking since she was 15 and is almost 51 now. 

What's the recommended way to about quitting? Are gum and patches worth it?

Thanks in advance for any help.

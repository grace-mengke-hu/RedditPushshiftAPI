1000 days... time to stop counting

Gonna just go ahead and call it. After 21 years of smoking, this is the milestone I've been waiting for to call myself a non-smoker. This is my last "celebration" or "milestone" I'll be tracking or looking forwards to. Believe me, if I can do it, while going to school full time, a full time job, and 5 kids.... anyone can do it.

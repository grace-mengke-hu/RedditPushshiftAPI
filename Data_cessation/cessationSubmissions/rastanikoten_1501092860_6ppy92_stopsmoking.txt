Struggling at day 12

I had a bad dream. It felt like a reflection of all the things I'm unhappy about in my life. Woke up with a bad attitude. Ever since waking up I've been grumpy, whiny and irritated and generally UN-FUCKING-HAPPY. I feel different and I don't like it. I feel kind of shaky and on edge. Like my nerves are acting up. I feel more like glass than steel today. Days like today are the reason my past quit attempts have not worked. I remember this has happened before and I started smoking again. I don't want to start smoking again but I do want to change how I feel today.

My one year thank you!

I just wanted to stop by on my first year smoke free! If it wasn't for this community I don't know if I would have found my inspiration for quitting smoking. 
I was pregnant and younger and I was really angry that I had to quit and really guilty that I was feeling that way. 
So from the bottom of my heart, /r/stopsmoking, thank you for you help, thank you for being supportive and incredible and amazing, you have made my life better, my partners life better and my children's life better!.

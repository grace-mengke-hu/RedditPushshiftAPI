Day 2 - carrying on

This weekend was too much. My lungs are strained after all the bongs and cigarettes. I feel like shit. I was coughing blood by the end of it. I decided, this stops now.

I know I won't smoke now for a day or two, just because of how terrifying my cough sounds. But what then? When I'm feeling all restless and have a had a couple of drinks, will I be so resolute?

How do I not let this end up being another "almost quit" moment?

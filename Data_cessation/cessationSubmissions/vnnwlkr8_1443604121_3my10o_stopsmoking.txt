Almost through the first 72 hours, doing great

Last Sunday I quit cigarettes for good. 

I read Allen Carr's book and that was the final kick I needed. I already knew about the numerous health benefits and the financial benefits, I was motivated to quit, but reading about the myths of smoking, the benefits that you create for yourself, was really the last piece of information I needed to leave this terrible addiction for good.

This time around, I don't feel the need to think about whether or not I may smoke in the future. Or think about switching to the occasional Cuban cigar. (I even threw away my 2 zippo's, my cigar cutter and my humidor. 250 euros gone. 1,5 month of not smoking cigarettes and I'm at a profit!)

I'm 23 and I have smoked for around 10 years, maybe a year of being quit in between. It's good this way. I don't want nicotine or tobacco to play any role in my life anymore.

I'm a non-smoker since last Sunday and I'm gonna enjoy it to the fullest! :)

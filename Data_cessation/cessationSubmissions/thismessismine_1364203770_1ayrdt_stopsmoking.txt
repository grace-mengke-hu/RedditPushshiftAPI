Does Alan Carr's book use hypnosis?

I have been listening to the audiobook format of Alan Carr's book *The Easy Way to Stop Smoking* lately.

I know that he says he randomly stopped smoking after visiting a hypnotherapist.  But since he went on to say that he quit in spite of the hypnotherapist, not *because* of hypnotherapy, I doubted that he would personally use such a technique.

However, my boyfriend has been listening with me recently and asked if Carr used hypnosis.  He pointed out how certain phrases were repeated word for word throughout even just the first few chapters, and these phrases were usually emphasized.

Just wondering if that's what he uses.  I am not opposed to it, either way... normally I would hate to be made suggestible but if it's for a cause like quitting smoking, I'm all for it.  Just curious.  Thanks!

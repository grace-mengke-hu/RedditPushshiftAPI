I have just made it through 24 hours smoke-free! I'm not gonna lie, it feels horrible...

I've been smoking for 9 years. Today I quit, just like that.

Well, mainly because why would anyone literally "burn" all that money?

I'm tired, confused, sad, and... scared? What is this thing I've been inhaling for the past 9 years?! I tried quitting before and had this feeling, but every time it's different.

I must make it through. I won't back down for nothing. 

Any tips are appreciated.

Edit: Wow guys thank you for all the support! I work on Sundays so I'll head to work now but I've read all your comments and they will help a lot. You guys are awesome!

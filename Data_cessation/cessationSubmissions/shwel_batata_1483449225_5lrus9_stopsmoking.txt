That's it, I hate smoking and I'm not going to be a slave for another hour.

 Edit 1: 6 hours and counting. It's not easy but I'm resisting it one craving at a time.

Here are my reasons why I hate smoking:

- Have an extra worry in life regarding when I can get my next cigarette
- It doesn't give me any pleasure
- It has never relieved any stressors
- I don't enjoy the cigarette breaks
- It's making me anti-social and prefer to be alone smoking without judgement from my family
- It makes me lazy about doing fun things because I'd rather be sitting at home and smoking
- I want to have babies someday and I don't want to be distracted by a need for a cigarette
- Smell on my fingers
- Yellow teeth
- Bad breath
- Can't kiss anytime I want
- I look ugly when I smoke
- It's disgusting
- Bad for my health
- Always having to step out to smoke sometimes in the cold/heat
- Makes me cough 
- I've been getting sick more since I started smoking
- Costs money
- It makes me pant 
- I want to be proud of myself for quitting
- I want to be free. It's constraining my freedom.
- It makes me eat more because I can't taste anything

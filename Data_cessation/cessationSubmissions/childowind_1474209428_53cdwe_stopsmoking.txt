Today is day 17

and I'm just now feeling like a nonsmoker as opposed to a smoker who just hasn't had a cigarette in a while.  I haven't had a really strong craving since Wednesday, which surprises me.  The last few days have been smooth sailing and I feel like I've probably beaten this now.

When I first quit, I didn't think I would be able to do this at all.  This is the first time I've tried because I was afraid of the pain of withdrawal.  It sucked.  It sucked really, really bad.  But I got through that, and I never want to experience physical withdrawal again.

Sure, I've thought about cigarettes over the past couple of days, but only when something has reminded me of them, and the thought was easily ignored.  I only feel like that's going to get even easier as time goes on now, and if I do have a strong craving, I know that I'm going to be able to get through it like I have all the others.

I know that I haven't quit for as long as a lot of others here, but for those in that first week, the first few days, just know that if I can get through that, you can too.  Things *will* get easier.  I promise you.

25 years. Today is cold turkey.

Those are the last of my cigarettes.   I've been smoking for 25 years.  I've tried the patch (multiple times), gum (multiple times) chantix (multiple times) e-cigarettes (multiple times).   The only thing I haven't done is cold turkey.  That is today.

I just finished one of those last 2.   In 25 min, I'm going to have the last one.  Then I'm going to take the entire thing to the trash (its trash day), shower and brush my teeth.   A clean start.

This is more than 10 years in the making.   I've taken a week off work.  I have lots of (sugarless) candy, plenty of things to do (I made a list), and reminders on my walls to breathe/do overhead presses/meditate/walk.   My girlfriend knows what she needs to do as well.  I'm ready.

Today is day one.

Edit 1:
I quite literally just passed the 24h mark.  1 day down.  This is, I believe, the first time in 24 years I've willing gone 24 hours without nicotine.

"Thank you" to every one of you who commented.  You have no idea how much it helped!  Actually, you probably do, heh!

Here's to the next 24 hours!

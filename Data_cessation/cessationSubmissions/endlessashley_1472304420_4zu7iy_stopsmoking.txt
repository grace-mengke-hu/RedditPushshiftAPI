Want so badly to quit, but I'm really nervous

Quitting smoking is something that's ALWAYS on my mind. I lurk here, I google info about it, I've read Alan Carr's book, I've done guided meditations, I've downloaded apps, but I've never managed to commit. 

I'm a PhD candidate, and graduate school is basically a marathon run of stress and anxiety. Smoking has always been my outlet for that anxiety, and I do it the most when I'm writing, to the point that I can't really focus or write at all when I don't have my cigarettes. I associate working with smoking, and since working is productivity, then smoking is productivity. On the one hand, now that it's all over but the dissertation, my schedule is really flexible and my deadlines are more or less self-imposed, so this would be as good a time as any to try to quit. But on the other hand, I'm worried that quitting will totally mess up my ability to make progress on my dissertation. I'm going to have to seriously retool everything about how I write, and I'm worried that it'll just be a recipe for failure--either failure to quit, or failure to stay on top of the task.  

Then, of course, there are all of the emotional attachments, which I've long suspected are far stronger than the physical attachments for me. Smoking is comforting. It's like my best friend, helping me get through the long and lonely days of this isolating, endless job I've taken on. 

But I don't want to be a smoker. It's not really how I see myself deep down, if that makes any sense. It's like every day that I smoke is another day that I'm being who I want to be, but I just can't take the next step. 

This is such a wonderfully helpful and supportive community, so I'm wondering if anyone has some experience that can speak to mine: either in a broader psychological way, or in an on-the-ground way (like tapering off vs. cold turkey vs. patches or gum). Thank you in advance for anything you can add.

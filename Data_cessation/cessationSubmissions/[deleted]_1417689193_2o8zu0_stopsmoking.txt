day one

So far so good. Smoking in the morning has always been my thing... sitting at the kitchen table with my coffee and smokes. Today I sat here reading this reddit. It helped... a lot! Still drank my coffee and sat at the kitchen table like always, I refuse to change the morning habit, I just no longer smoke when I do it. Thanks for being here guys. You all help more than you know. I just hope you don't get tired of me posting all the time, as posting here helps me stay focused. <3

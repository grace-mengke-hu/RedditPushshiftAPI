Two weeks if I can get through tonight!

I was a more or less casual smoker for about six years. I only smoked while I drank, which I stuck to pretty reliably, but when I drank I'd smoke a lot, usually a pack. I also drank about two to three times a week too, and getting older magnified the negative effects of smoking and none of the positives. Tried to stop a few times over the last year, but this one feels the best so far. Last Saturday I managed to skip cigarettes while drunk with smokers (I cheated a little with an e cigarette) and I plan to do the same tonight!

I'm hoping I can be the first in my circle of friends (who are a bit less casual) to quit and help give them some motivation to do the same.

Started school up again and I'm trying to eat better too.. Lots of changes! I'll work on the drinks next. It's only once a week at most and so long as I'm not getting sloppy it might be a vice I keep.

To the weekend, friends!

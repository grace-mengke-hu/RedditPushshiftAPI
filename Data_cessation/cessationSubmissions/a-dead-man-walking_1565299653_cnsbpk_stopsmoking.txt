Tips to quit smoking?

(Warning: self harm mention, might be triggering to some)

I've been smoking for 2 years now on and off, last year a pack could last me about a month 'cause I only smoked when I was stressed out. I struggle a lot with self harm too, been clean for about half a year. Now a pack lasts me half a week at most, since I can't cut I often smoke when I feel the urge. I'm finding some better coping mechanisms in the meantime. I also just want to quit smoking because it's a habit I picked up from a shitty ex.

Cold turkey doesn't work for me, I'll last a few days and then the craving gets so bad I'll smoke a whole pack of 22 in a day. It's expensive and really destructive at this point. Any tips to slowly decrease the amount I smoke and how to handle the cravings?

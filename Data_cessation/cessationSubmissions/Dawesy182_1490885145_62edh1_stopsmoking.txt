Sense of smell returning!

At work i normally have a some sort of fruity tea in the afternoon so I'm not having excessive amounts of caffeine from coffee. Today ,i had a mango and strawberry tea which is one i have quite often and is  nice. It was put on my desk and i was overcome with this amazing smell. I asked a couple people on desks near me what the smell was and they looked a bit puzzled before saying "you mean your tea". They thought i was weird for not knowing what my tea smelt like even though I've had this on a regular basis for about 2.5 years. It was a real eye opener as to the harm smoking actually does to your body. Signs of progress really help keep the motivation to not smoke.

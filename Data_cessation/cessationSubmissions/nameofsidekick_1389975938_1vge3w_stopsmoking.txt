Help re-quitting smoking?

Hi r/stopsmoking,

I need some help (and to reset my badge). I quit smoking for 11 months but started again after a really bad breakup (6 years). I'm already back up to four or five cigarettes a day, but really really want to stop. I'm writing papers right now, so it's hard to deal with some of the withdrawal symptoms (the vocab recall stuff) but I just don't want to use smoking as a crutch and get too far into it.

I've started reading Allen Carr again, and I'm thinking about taking Chantix, but I'm pretty worried about the side effects. Does anyone have experience with chantix? I don't want to get depressed because I just had a breakup, so it might not be a good idea for me. 

Anyway, let me know. Any words of encouragement are also good too. I'm going to try and go the rest of the day without a cigarette and just take a walk/drink some water/have a shower/read allen carr whenever I feel the urge.

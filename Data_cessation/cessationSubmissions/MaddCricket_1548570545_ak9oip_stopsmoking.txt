Currently in a bar.

First time I’ve allowed myself to go out to a bar where there are smokers and drinking.  I’ve only thought about smoking three times in the past six hours I’ve been out and each time has been brought on by someone mentioning it.  Four months in and I feel so happy that I can actually forget about smoking in a social setting, though I still have a small crave I can just loose myself in the music and push it away!  When I was a smoker I’d be out on that patio every half hour, now I don’t even have to think hard about it.  

AND IVE BEEN DRINKING!!!!!! this is amazing.  You guys can do it too, just give it your best foot forward and impress yourself!  Good luck to everyone quitting!  I wish as much success as I have had with this upon all of you!

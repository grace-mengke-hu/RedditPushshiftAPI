Is it better to spit out post quit cough gunk? Mine doesn't seem to want to come out!

My cough started 2 days ago and I'm not having much success expelling gunk out of my body. I got only one spit that was clear. Should I be worried I'm keeping toxins inside?  

I can feel fluid moving around my throat after coughing. Is it ok to keep swallowing it? 

TL;DR. I'm gross. Anyone else experience this?

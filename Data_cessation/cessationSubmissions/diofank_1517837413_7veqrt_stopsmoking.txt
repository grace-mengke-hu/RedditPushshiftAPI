Tired with headache - mistaking it for craving

I didn't sleep too well last night due to outside circumstances. Anyway, I thought I was craving a cigarette worse than ever before: having a headache, feeling lightheaded and woozy. Instead of nicotine, I took a panadol which helped with the headache and the "craving" is mostly gone.

It's incredible what your addicted brain tries to tell you to make you grab a cigarette again! One more day when I haven't given in and I learned that headaches can occur without being a symptom of nicotine withdrawal.

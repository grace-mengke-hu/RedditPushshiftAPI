I quit 6 days ago, 0 nicotine in my life, but I’m going through an especially stressful possibly life changing day.

Yesterday was unbelievably stressful, today is continuing to pile on to that situation. I’m trying to go completely nicotine free but I’m craving it sooo bad to deal with this stress I feel like I’m gonna die. I have no desire to hit a cig at all, my craving is entirely for vaping. I wanna take just a few more hits but I don’t know if that will mess with my withdrawal or not. Like prolong it or what. What do you guys think? Will it mess everything up if I take a couple hits from a vape? 

It’s super unfortunate that such stressful and emotionally draining events that are potentially life changing (in a bad way) happened to fall within the first week of quitting nicotine.

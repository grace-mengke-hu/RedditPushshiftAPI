I've had enough

I'm tired of being a smoker, I've been smoking for 5 years now, started when I was 19 (though I had a couple once in a while before then). I'm giving myself the last of my pack (Have about a half left, usually go through a pack every couple of days). Once I finish my pack, I think I'll start with the lozenges. I know it's not cutting nicotine, but I'd much rather just not smoke and still get some nicotine in me then go cold turkey, because I know I have weak self control.

Hopefully it sticks. I'll try to post on here everyday, at least for a little bit, so I can be put on the judging block.

And keep on trucking, to all who are trying to quit! Glad I found this subreddit

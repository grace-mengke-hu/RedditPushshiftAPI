well damn, that's actually how long it's been since my last cigarette

haven't been here in a little while, but it's pretty crazy to see that number next to my name actually reflecting when I quit rather than telling me how long it's been since the last time I tried to quit.

whatever flavor of shit you're treading through just keep your head up cause it'll get better with time, ok?

keep it up ya'll, you can do it. cheers.

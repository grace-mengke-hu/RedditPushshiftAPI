Anybody else has tried a bazillion times to quit for good ? For those who have succeeded, what has been different this time ?

I've read Easy Way by Allen Carr, thrown countless full packs thinking "this time will be the one", tried all kinds of mental tricks, but always ended up relapsing. I think my longest streak has been something like two weeks.

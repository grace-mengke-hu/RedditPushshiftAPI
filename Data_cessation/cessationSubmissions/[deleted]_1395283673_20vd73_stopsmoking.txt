Almost One Week and Last Night Was Hard

I'm just shy of a week without a smoke.  I've also stopped drinking to avoid the trigger.  Last night I stopped off at a watch store to have my watch maintenanced.  The watch store happens to be near my old watering holes and man the cravings kicked in hard as a MF as soon as I left the store.  I want to quit and didn't want to break - but that did not make it any easier.  So to get my mind off it I ran into a store and looked at neckties for about 20 mins.  Once I felt a little more calm I got on a train and went home.  Phew.  One week of being smoke free is coming up.  To the fellow quitters just starting out - stay strong! I read that if you're hit with a crave do something to take your mind off it.  I did that last night and it worked.

Also, a week out and I can notice the improved quality of taste, smell, breathing and air.  My energy and ability to concentrate have also noticably improved....

Not so much of a support group but kind of.

I was thinking of starting up a group in Orange County, California.
Nothing like a 12 step or any religion based program. I really just want a social group that can meet up maybe once a week or go out on weekends because of how social smoking is I figure its good to find like minded people to surround yourself. I quit just the other day but I feel even still i can be some help- as others can also help me.
Just a thought, I also think that I will start a Facebook group for the same reason. 

Let me know if its a good idea or if you are in the area and would like to help or meet up.

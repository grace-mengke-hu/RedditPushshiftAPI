I cheated last night :(

So I haven't bought a pack in 55 days or so, and I'm pretty much over cigarettes I can honestly say. However, last night I'm at the bar and I wasn't even highly intoxicated, but I just got a random craving and bummed a cig from a friend. I smoked it, and by the time I was done it was horrible. After that I went about my night and didn't think about it again and haven't really craved one since. Still pretty mad at myself though for just giving in so easy though.

Did anyone else ever do this? Another reason I decided to stop smoking.

So my mom had just died, and I headed home to do the stuff that needs to be done in such situations. I had considered quitting while I was there since it would be a change in routine and I would be busy and around non-smoking people a lot but i wasn't thinking that one through, and continued to smoke. I would mainly smoke at her house where there was noone staying, and put the cigs out in the planter on the porch. I was smoking American Spirit, which for whatever reason I can't smoke a whole stick so I would suck a little then put the ash part of the butt in the dirt that held an old dead plant and an American flag on a wood stick. I continue to do this for the four days I was there, not staying at the house overnight. 

On the last day I have a flight that evening and i'm at the house, going to put out a butt. I notice that the plant looks a lot lower than it had before. I grab the flag and stir, and the dirt collapses to the bottom and smoke comes pouring out of the planter. The ceramic planter is HOT.  I run in the house to get water, hoping the flag doesn't burst into flames and set the wooden porch swing on fire. I pour the water into the planter and it's like the whole mass of dirt, cig ashes, and FOAM BALLS (filler for plants?) is on fire, along with the wooden stick of the flag. After one bucket I take it out into the garden and dump it out; I need another bucket to put out the smoldering remains of the cig ashes (not butts!) and foam balls, so they don't burn my mom's house where everything from our family history from generations is stored. I just stood there totally freaked out about what I almost did.
And I think if I'd flown out that morning and not gone to her house...

TL;DR: I almost burnt down my mom's house the week she died.

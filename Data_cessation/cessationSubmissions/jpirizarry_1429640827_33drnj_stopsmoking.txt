Just started my third week today

I've been doing cold turkey for two weeks. So far it haven't been as hard as I thought it would be. But today I feel like I want to punch a baby in the face, or run over an old lady with my car. I don't know if it is the stress at work or what, but it seems that today it's been as tough as my second and third day of quitting. I'm really hoping that it will get better soon.

Can you help me prepare for the challenge ahead?

I currently am an avid poster on /r/leaves. I want to be both cigarette and weed free by the end of this semester - that is my goal. I've smoked 5 years, and toked about 9 years, and in those years I've tried quitting dozens of times. 

I guess it is worth noting that over the years, I've been able to go about a year and a half without weed, but never over the 2 month mark with cigarettes (usually no more than a week the other times). NEVER have I been able to quit both at the same time.

I'm currently 18 days of being weed-free. I'm starting to think that quitting smoking should happen in about a week or so. I guess this post is kind of like a preemptive strike. What is the best way to prepare to quit smoking cigarettes? Are there tips and tricks that have helped you guys along the way? Has anyone been in the same situation, trying to quit smoking and toking at the same time? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

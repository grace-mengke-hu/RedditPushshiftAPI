Fail

I had posted that I was having a rough time traveling and staying on track. But I was okay, I really was.

Then, while on this business trip, my back went out...completely. I had to see a chiro this morning and well, I gave in to my temptation this evening on the way back to my hotel. Shit! 

Just had to tell someone. I will get back on track.

Seasonal Cravings Are Bumming Me Out

I'm nearly 7 months smoke-free and I don't miss it. The past few days I feel blindsided by how much I crave a cigarette. I haven't had a craving in months and now I notice smokers everywhere. I'm not tempted to smoke but I find it a little disheartening that I'm still able to randomly get a intense craving just because. Anybody dealing with seasonal craving or experience it in the past?

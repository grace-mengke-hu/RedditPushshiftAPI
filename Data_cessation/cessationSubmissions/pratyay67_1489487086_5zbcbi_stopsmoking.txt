Help me!! I want to quit, bad!

Hello everyone! 

It's been my (I forgot how many times)th attempt to quit smoking. Everytime I try to quit, I fall again into its trance once I have a good meal. 
I live away from my home for college, and in the dorm in which I stay, there are 5-6 other smokers. 
We smoke cigarettes and weed together, but now I'm feeling is high time to do away with smoking for good. 

The longest I went without smoking is a month; I worked out, had a good time (when I went home in the vacations). 
After returning to college I started again. 

Help me!! 
It's been very hard for me since I stay among a circle of smokers.

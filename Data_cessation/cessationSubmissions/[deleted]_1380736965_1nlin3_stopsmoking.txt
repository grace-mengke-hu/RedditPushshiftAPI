UPDATE to I want to restart after being quit for 222 days. I caved. What to do now?

Has anyone caved and then requit? It has greatly alleviated my symptoms of withdrawal from my gf but doesn't feel good- is disgusting and made me edgy and not feel too great otherwise. But the dopamine helps a ton. Just smoked a whole cig. What do I do now. I don't want to go through this again but the agony of the past few weeks since my breakup has been bad too. Help please. :(

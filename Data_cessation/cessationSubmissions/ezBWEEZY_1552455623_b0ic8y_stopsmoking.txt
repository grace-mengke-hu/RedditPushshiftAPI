9 days out

And man oh man oh man. Worst part, by far, has been not being able to sleep. I’ve never been a great sleeper, but I’ve gotten better in the last year but now quitting (a week before we spring forward at that, good lord) has completely put me at square one again. I even tried to get around it tonight by taking a bath and getting into bed at 9. This sucks, but I don’t feel like smoking.

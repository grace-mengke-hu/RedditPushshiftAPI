I made a huge step in quitting!

I'm no longer smoking while driving!

Background: I've been smoking for the last 6 years. I commute about an hour to an hour and a half each way everyday Monday-Friday. Every time I switch highways, I pull out another cigarette.

I had a rental car for a couple weeks while my bumper was replaced. Since you can't smoke in a rental, I decided to quit the smoking and driving habit. I honestly did not think I could do it. It was the most liberating two weeks of my life! I have my car back now and have not gone back. It's been 16 days and my car smells great!

Now, I still smoke when I get to the office but am down to about 4 per day and none on weekends unless I'm drinking. 

I know I still have a ways to go but I'm pretty proud of this step!

Thanks for all the support! This sub has been really helpful. My birthday is in less than two weeks and my goal is to be smoke free by then. Wish me luck!

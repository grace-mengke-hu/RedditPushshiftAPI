It's been nearly 48 hours (tw blood)

Since I went to the hospital because I was coughing up blood. I decided I was done smoking. They did every test in the book and couldn't find anything wrong. I want one so bad right now. But I don't want them to eventually find something wrong. It was one of the scariest things ever to happen to me. Please take my advice, it does get better. I quit for 7 years and never thought about it. Started back up about 4 years ago. Don't know why, wish I didn't. I am done for good this time.

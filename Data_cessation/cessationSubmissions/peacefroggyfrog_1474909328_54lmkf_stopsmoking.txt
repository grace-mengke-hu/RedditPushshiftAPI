I am 20 today and officially a non smoker

This has got to be like the 50th time I've quit, I've been smoking since I was 12. I'm tired of burning my lips  and fingers while smoking, and sucking air at PT, and as a broke private in the army I can't afford to buy cancer sticks anymore. 

I'm really stressed and tempted to go buy a pack already, but I know you guys will keep my strong :) I've been reading this sub for a while and y'all inspired me to quit for good this time. Looking forward to getting one of those cool badges soon. 

Wish me luck!

Free Quit Smoking Resource for Cancer Patients

 

Greetings [r/stopsmoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking). Are you trying to quit smoking and have been recently diagnosed with cancer?

We are excited to announce [Quit2Heal, a pilot trial testing a quit smoking smartphone app made specifically for cancer patients.](https://quit2heal.org/) We have opened recruitment for Quit2Heal and we are reaching out to [r/stopsmoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking) in hopes that this may be a helpful resource to those of you that may need it.

This is the first app created for people who have been diagnosed with cancer. As you may already know, 64% of cancer patients who smoke pre-diagnosis continue to smoke post-diagnosis and we are working hard to change this. Smoking cigarettes negatively impacts oncology treatment, increases recurrence of cancer after remission, and reduces overall survival rates from cancer. But cancer patients who quit smoking heal better and recover faster from treatment.

We are the Health and Behavioral Innovations in Technology (HABIT) group at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. The HABIT research team is committed to helping people quit smoking and live longer, healthier lives.

Please visit [www.Quit2Heal.org](http://www.quit2heal.org/) or email us at [quit2heal@fredhutch.org](mailto:quit2heal@fredhutch.org) if you have any questions.

Warmly,

HABIT group

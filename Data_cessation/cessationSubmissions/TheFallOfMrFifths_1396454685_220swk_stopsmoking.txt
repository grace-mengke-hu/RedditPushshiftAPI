Six months, two weeks, four days.

One thing that keeps me on point is saying out loud that I don't smoke anymore. It's weirdly satisfying telling people that I'm a non-smoker. 
This is my fourth attempt and I've made it farther than ever. I'm in it for the long haul now, best of luck to all of you trying to do better.

Thanks All! Yesterday was a bad one!

Thank you all! Well I made it to day 26! Still smoke free, but very fragile. Thank you! Am taking all advise on board. Am off to the Drs today more as a reassurance thing I think, but if it isn't then I will deal with it! Up to this week my quit experience has been good! And at times easy and happy to be doing it! Also the extinction burst, everyone look it up, another look at the tantrum your own body throws. Wow great advise. It good to stick a label on what I am going though! So glad to be here and still be able to say I will not smoke today!

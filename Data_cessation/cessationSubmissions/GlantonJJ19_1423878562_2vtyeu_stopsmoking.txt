100 days

smoked over ten years, went from experimental use to over half a pack a day. quit last year for a bit, then started again. this is my second attempt, and is the longest ive gone without smoking since i started.


same as the first attempt, i went cold turkey, finished off my pack on a monday night, tuesday i'm a "nonsmoker". aside from the minor discomfort of the initial withdrawal, i have no real urge to smoke cigarettes. although, there's still that little voice in the back of my head telling me this isnt forever, and that eventually i will smoke again... so far i'm able to tell the little voice to fuck off, but its definately something i need to keep an eye on.


all in all, im finding this quitting thing not too hard, and as long as i continue to not be an idiot, i think i'll be ok.


PS: smoking cannabis doesnt count as "smoking", right?

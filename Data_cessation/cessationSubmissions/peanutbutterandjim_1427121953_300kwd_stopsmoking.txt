Asthma issues after quitting?

I started smoking when I was 17.  Sixteen years later, I quit for good.  I have been nicotine-free for almost four months and have had no breathing issues since I quit (if anything, it got better).  Enter tree pollen (I live in Alabama).  I am now experiencing occasional shortness of breath as well as shallow breathing.  I laid down a few nights ago and actually had trouble getting a good breath.  I have never had any issues with asthma, but I have developed a few allergy issues over the past five years (swollen sinuses during pollen season).  Has anyone else ever noticed symptoms of asthma after quitting?

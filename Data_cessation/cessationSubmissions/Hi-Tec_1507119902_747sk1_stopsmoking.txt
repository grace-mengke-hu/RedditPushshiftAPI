Non smoker for 1 year, I am still getting triggered

I tried to quit smoking 3 times. 

1st time in high school. i was smoking for 1 year already. I got sick and something clicked in me to make me not want smokes. I felt like i never smoked before. no triggers. then after a week i started smoking again just for curiosity.

2nd time, 6 years later, i stopped quitting again. it was extremely hard for the first month, annoying for the second, an in third something clicked in my brain that made me stop getting triggered by smokes. my friends were all smoking and it didn't bother me or make me want to smoke. when my girlfriend dumped me and I started drinking and smoking, just not caring if i destroy my body.

3rd time, a year ago, i stopped again. first month was so much easier this time. second month was about the same, but at third month nothing clicked. I was still getting triggered. whenever i am bored, lonely, sad, angry, drunk, when someone else lights up a smoke, when someone mentions smoking, when someone offers me smokes i get triggered. 

Don't get me wrong, every time i resist, the next time gets easier, every day, week and month gets easier. triggers are becoming more and more far apart, less and less strong, and they last for less and less time. BUT I'M STILL GETTING THE DAMN THINGS!  Will the part of the brain that's making me want to smoke just die already so i can move on with my life?

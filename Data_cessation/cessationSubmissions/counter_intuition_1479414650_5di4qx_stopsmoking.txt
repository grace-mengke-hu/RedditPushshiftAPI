Almost got one week under my belt...

and I've only thought about buying a pack about 300 times. I found myself late at night still going on my balcony and looking for my pack of smokes only to realize that they weren't there. It's been really difficult to cut this

Only been smoking for about a year but I was already noticing huge effects on my breathing. I play French Horn and was noticing my air capacity and playing ability overall shrinking. Good luck to us all.

When (WHEN) I make it through today without a smoke, it will be the first day in 16 years I haven't had one.

I have been a smoker for more than half of my life (I'm 32).  Yesterday I ran out of reasons to smoke.  I had my last smoke at 9:30 last night, followed by the moment of panic as i flicked my butt and realized there was one drag left.

 I realized that it is so routine and embedded into my life and it really was a wake up call.  Oh you are outside?  SMOKE!  Oh you just had some coffee?  SMOKE!  The obligation i felt to check out of my life once an hour.  Interrupting a play session with my two year old daughter to walk out and smoke.  On my broke days i chose to smoke instead of eat lunch.  Funny enough, the fact that it was killing me was the least of my worries.  I've used cigarettes to neglect my life and check out of every possible situation you can imagine, and i want to take accountability for that and not replace smoking with something equally addictive. 

I've had enough.  So here I am, sitting in my cube noticing that it is my usual time to smoke. I am typing this instead of going outside.  Any words of wisdom are quite welcome.  

Edit:  Made it through the day of work and home with the kid so going strong!  Thanks for all of the support everyone!  You guys are really helping to keep this in perspective for me today.  It is now by far the longest I've ever went without any nicotine as a legal adult.  I will definitely be around this sub a plenty!

Was smoking your "reward"?

I could go hours without smoking every day at work. We can't smoke on campus and sometimes I arrive at work as early at 7am and can't leave until 6pm or later.

That cigarette was my reward for a long hard day.

I'm finding it extremely painful to quit. Like, I think about smoking all the time. But my husband, who could smoke on the job anytime he wanted and smoked as much as a two or more packs a day, doesn't think about it at all. It's as though he's *s*o done with it that it disgusts him that he ever smoked (for twenty plus years). And I'm very proud of him for that.

So...I guess what I'm asking is if smoking was your reward at the end of a long day, what did you replace that reward with? I'm really struggling with that right now.

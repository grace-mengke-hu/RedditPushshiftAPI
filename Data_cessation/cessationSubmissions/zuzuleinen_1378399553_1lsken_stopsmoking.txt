How can I avoid being nervous and agitated?

After 3 days of quitting I feel sometimes I'm going crazy. I'm not really craving for cigars, but today for example I got pissed off on everyone at work. 

I think the cause is quitting smoking, so I ask those of you who manage to control your anger how do you succeed?

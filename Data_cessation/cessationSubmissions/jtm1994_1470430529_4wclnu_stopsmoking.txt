Day 200!!!

Yay I think I've actually done it this time!! I very seldom think about smoking these days and feel like a whole new person. It's my 200th day and I've saved just under $4,000 from no smoking, which has allowed me to move into a nicer house! Life is good. For all you guys starting off, it gets better I promise! You can all do it ☺️

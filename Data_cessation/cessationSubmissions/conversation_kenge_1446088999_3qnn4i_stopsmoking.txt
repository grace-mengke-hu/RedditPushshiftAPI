Anyone else experience delayed irritability?

Hey guys! So I had a quick question. I quit smoking 69 days ago (that badge is handy) and I did not feel terribly irritable the first few weeks after I quit. I quit right before moving to a new place, and oddly even then I didn't have insanely powerful cravings (honestly, I was relieved to be breathing more.) However, now thats its more than two months out, I'm hella irritable. The way that I used to be when I didn't have a smoke for a few hours and everyone just annoyed the piss out of me. It really makes me want to smoke. I just can't think of anything else that would relax me so quickly and so reliably. Could this be delayed withdrawal irritability, or just a sign that I've been anxious for a while but now lack a crutch? Either way, any advice is appreciated. I guess I thought the first month would be hardest, but this is feeling especially hard...

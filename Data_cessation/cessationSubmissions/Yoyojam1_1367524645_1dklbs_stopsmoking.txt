Smoked over half my life. I figure its about time I stop

I started smoking when I was 16. Now that I'm 32, I'm really starting to feel guilty about smoking. Today is my first day cigarette free, and I'm feeling pretty good about it. 

I have been lurking here for a while and I really love this sub-reddit 

Thanks everybody!!

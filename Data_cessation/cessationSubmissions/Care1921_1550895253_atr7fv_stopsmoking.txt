*..Inspire 7 People ..*

it has been a while since I have written. I want to say how absolutely great not smoking is! I cannot believe that I thought somehow "I wouldnt be me anymore" if I was not a smoker. I am baffled at how easy this is. 41 days in and it is incredible to me that I was not already living life this way! I feel better emotionally, mentally, and physically. even if the changes aren't severely drastic, they are still there! and I have inspired at least 7 other people to quit smoking also. three of which are quit, three  that are in process, and one who relapsed.  but my friend put it to me like this, "if you inspired those seven people to quit, and then they insprire 7 more of their friends to quit, imagine how that number can  exponentially grow! and how many people you would be helping!" she could not be more right, and that makes my heart so happy!! &lt;3 *..inspire 7 people..*

Anyone else smoke when they drink?

I don't see a problem with it now. I used to say I only did when i drank, but my friends and I drank everyday. Now as I've gotten older its once or twice a week. 

I like the feeling of letting go of all inhibitions, then waking up and accepting that you blew off some steam, time to get back to the grind. Tomorrow, for example, I will be buying a case of beers and a pack of cigarettes and watch football all day eat wings and whatever else i want. Then on monday its chicken, fruits, veggies and everything else healthy plus gym. 

Anyone else do this?

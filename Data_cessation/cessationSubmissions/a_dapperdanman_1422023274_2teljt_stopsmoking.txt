Finally past the 3 day mark.

I've always been told that the first 3 days are the worst, I believe it had something to do with the physical addiction, and that after those days it is all mental. It definitely feels nice to not have to worry about how I smell, how my breath is, or freezing my ass off in this cold weather. Wellbutrin has been working some pretty awesome wonders on me, which without it, would of made this 10x more difficult.

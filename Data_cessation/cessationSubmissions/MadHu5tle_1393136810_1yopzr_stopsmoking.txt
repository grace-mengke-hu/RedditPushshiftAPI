Drunk, fight with wife, but still not smoking

First time posting here, I'm a bit drunk so you'll have to excuse my slurs. But it is a small win. I quit on Jan 9, after 2 years of on / off again smoking and quitting (20 years smoking total), always feeling guilty. Tonight a I went to the bar with smokers, and didn't smoke. I came home, fought with the wife, and still didn't smoke. May not seem that big a deal to some, but kind of a win for me, those were always the triggers that got me to smoke before, but tonight I didn't and I feel like it's a real accomplishment! So if anybody is reading this and you feel like life events keep you from escaping nicotine, just know that it gets better quickly. Only a month and a half without nicotine, and I already don't feel like I "have" to smoke when things get stressful!

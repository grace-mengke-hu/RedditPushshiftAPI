Feel fucked up but the only way out is to keep going

I will start with a little history. I made my second attempt to quit smoking 9 weeks back and I relapsed after twelve days. It started by my mind telling me that I’ll just smoke one, went on to half pack, went on to two packs and now am smoking pack a day again. It is bad. Very bad. 

After I was 12 days into my streak, I landed this big gig with big payment. I have never worked in my life without cigarettes. This drove my anxiety through the roof and I relapsed. Anyone who has never  worked without cigarettes, how do you guys manage to stay on top of your work without smoking? 

I have realised that when I achieve something small, my mind triggers this emotion that I can slack off and celebrate and start again the next day. I need to stop doing this. 

I AM QUITTING. When I wake up tomorrow morning, I am not going to smoke. Never ever again. I want to start on with weightlifting at the gym again after 6 years. Do you think it is a good idea to quit and start lifting at the same time? If any of you have done this before, it would be great to know what difficulties you faced trying to lift and quit at the same time. 

Just writing this here because I need to vocalise my decisions so that I stick to them. Will start the timer again and this time it is going to be forever. 

Any advise and motivation from y’all will be very helpful. Keep going guys, we can do it. 

Love.

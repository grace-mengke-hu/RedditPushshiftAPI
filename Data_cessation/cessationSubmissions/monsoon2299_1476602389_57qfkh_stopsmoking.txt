went cold turkey since 14th oct after 3 years of regular smoking to compliment with 2-3 years of party type smoking i.e. smoking while drinking!

so had this thought when i woke up friday oct 14th and went to buy a pack of cigarettes. the shops were closed because it was prayer time ( i live in a muslim country). then i made to implement the decision which i had made once before 3-4 months and failed after a month. i hope to get through this time with just 3 days on!

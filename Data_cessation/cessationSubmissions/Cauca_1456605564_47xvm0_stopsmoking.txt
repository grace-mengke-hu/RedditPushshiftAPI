Just gave in after four years due to a very stressful and dramatic chain of events. I would appreciate advice on relapse.

I've smoked about 4 packs in two weeks. I used to smoke a pack and a half a day and that's where I'm headed.


I won't write a wall of text with all that's happened in my life in the last few months. Let's just say that it's been extreme. I would appreciate advice. Thanks all.

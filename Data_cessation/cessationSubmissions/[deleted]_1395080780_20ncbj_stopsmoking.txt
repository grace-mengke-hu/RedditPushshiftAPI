I fucking hate smoking!!!

The way it destroyed life around me and still look like an innocuous crutch is fucking amazing. I remember when I was a non-smoking teenager, I could take a mathematics problem and think about it for hours. When I liked a book, I would not move till I finish it. In chess, I could think of multiple combinations of next 4-5 moves. 

Now all that is lost. If I am forced to think of something, a simple excel trick, for half an hour I need a 15 minutes break. If I am in a meeting for 45 minutes, I don't care whether you are my boss, CEO or a celebrity, I need a 15 minutes break and I will come back with a smell that will fill the whole room. I can apply my brain passively for 45 minutes and actively for some 20 minutes before I need a break.

In my office, none of the guys I would respect professionally or personally are smoker. So I would either smoke alone or in a company that I inherently dislike. Same with any other place. The thing that started for good, enchanting conversation has made it impossible to have a passionate discussion now.

I was never a athlete type but I was competitive and full of mental energy. I could compete with anyone on badminton just with my precise shots. Last week when I played, it felt like I will vomit my lungs.

My long time GF, studying to be a pediatrician, gave me a "tour" of cancer ward and its patients. I was so distressed I went for a smoke. I continued smoking.

This is just two days since I have not smoked but there is no way I am going to smoke a cigarette again. I can't leave my personal and material life for something that never even gave me any real pleasure.

Fuck Cigarettes!!!

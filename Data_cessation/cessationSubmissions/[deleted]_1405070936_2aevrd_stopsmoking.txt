Second time

I never smoked a lot. I used to smoke 2-3 a day for almost 8 years. I quit for one year. Jan 1, 2012 - Jan 1, 2013. :) It was a challenge! Then, i started smoking again. I decided to quit again as i wanted to do cardio exercises and strength training to get back in Shape. I'd almost quit. I used to smoke like once a week or just while I'm out with friends drinking. And now, I've started again and it's crazy. I've been smoking a lot like 5 a day. I started it just to learn the new trend of rolling cigarettes. I thought I'll just buy one small box of Tobacco ad quit. But, I bought the second box. :( I hope I'll quit again.

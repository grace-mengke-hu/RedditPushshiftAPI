Need a bit of encouragement...

Hi all. This is a work alt, so it won't show my badge, but I've been smoke free for 690 days. 11737 cigarettes not smoked. Yet, lately, the stress at work makes me want a cigarette. I've begun dreaming about them again. I've got a few coworkers that smoke, and it makes me want to do it all the more.

I went a year with nothing. The dreams continued, so I invested in a cheap e-cig kit, and have been using that daily. I feel like I'm getting the same, if not more, nicotine than when I was smoking. And now people think I'm one of those pretentious e-cig douchebags. I don't vape around other people, I don't make huge clouds of vapor, I use it to control my urges to have a cigarette. But it sometimes seems that cigarettes are more socially acceptable than e-cigarettes, as odd as that may seem.

I just need some encouragement, as none of my friends really seem to know what I'm going though even though they have vices of their own. Thanks all.

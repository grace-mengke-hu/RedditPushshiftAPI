Not breaking for anything.

So my uncle passed away last night. He was really close with my family. With all my family gathered, I found my aunt who was my biggest inspiration to quitting, smoking a cigarette. I didn't blame her for it, I understand the pressure but I just walked away.

I just want to say thanks for the help thus far. Even in hard times like these, smoking will not help. It will only make things worse. Best of luck to everyone else quitting right now, you guys will do fine!

I need help.

I'm completely lost. I slipped yesterday and then I got hit this morning with the mother of all withdrawals and went and bought another pack, I've only had 2 cigs in the 8 days that I've been clean. Which, is better than the 20+ I smoked a day. I just don't know what to do, I'm either going to die from complications from smoking or die and still want for a cigarette. I don't want withdrawals for the rest of my life, but I'm going to have to because I made a really bad decision at the age of 16. I'm so lost, I need help. I'm really in the deepest of dumps.

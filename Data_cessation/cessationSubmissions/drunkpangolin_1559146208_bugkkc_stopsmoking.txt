Wholesale quitting

Today I took the plunge. I figured if I was going to battle cravings, urges and triggers, might as well take advantage and tackle more than one issue.

 I'm quitting smoking, drinking (I've been, for the past couple of years, drinking more than I should, on my way to the high functioning alcoholic clich√©.) and had gotten quite fat.

Last year I did keto, which implied only drinking moderately, and only red wine or dry, liquors.

I lost over 27 kilos, and felt very well, however, the coughing in the morning, or my shortness of breath at the gym was telling me something.

So, this morning I decided it was time. I gave my pack to a buddy, had me a keto breakfast, and haven't had a drink, even though I spent all morning doing stuff at a bar I'm probably taking over in about a week.

For me it's 6PM, and I've only had three or four real urges.

I have in my pocket a small vape, as a damage control device, but I have not had the urge. Damn it feels great to kick so many demon's asses all at once!

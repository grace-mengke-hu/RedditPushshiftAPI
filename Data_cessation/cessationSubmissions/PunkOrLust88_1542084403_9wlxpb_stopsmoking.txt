Finding Motivation and Meaning in a Quit Date

I’ve really been struggling to find the motivation to set a firm quit date.   I quit for about a month last month, and was feeling great about myself, but unfortunately I relapsed when I thought I was out of the woods and could have “just one”.   Ever since, I’ve attempted to quit every other day but now these quit dates have lost their meaning because I always end up caving in.   There’s nothing “special” or “symbolic” about my quit date anymore because they’re so frequent now and it’s hard for me to stay focused in the wake of so many past failures.   Any advice on staying on track after a relapse?   I’ve been feeling so distant from my past successes that it’s hard for me to stick with it on “day one” because I’m so preoccupied with how I screwed up previously.   I definitely become more disciplined as the smoke-free days pile up and increase, but I really struggle through those single digit days because I feel like I don’t have anything to lose in the moment.   Hard to explain but I just wanted to write my thoughts out, thanks for listening.

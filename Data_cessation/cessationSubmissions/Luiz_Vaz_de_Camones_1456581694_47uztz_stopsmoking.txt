Ways to stop smoking tobacco but keep smoking marijuana

Hello,
I smoke joints (tobacco+weed) and cigarettes and would like to quit the cigarettes. I have a few questions:
Is it possible? Will I have to replace the joints by some other way of consuming the weed or will I have to quit the weed aswell?

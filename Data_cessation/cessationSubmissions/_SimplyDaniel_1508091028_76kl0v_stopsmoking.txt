I just...

Had to reset my badge, I went 139 days without smoking. I went to the store and bought a pack and smoked it all. The weird thing is, I am still trying to figure out why I did it. I bought and smoked the pack so unaware almost like I never quit. Until the pack was gone, then I was like wait I don't smoke anymore. Has that ever happened to anyone?

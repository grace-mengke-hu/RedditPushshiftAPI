Were there any words from a loved one that actually worked and made you quit? 

Both of my parents have smoked for about 40 years. My paternal grandmother died from lung cancer. My maternal grandmother died from emphysema. My mother swore that she would quit if her own mother died from it. That was 20 years ago! I recently lost my father-in-law to lung cancer. This week they found a "spot" in my father's lung. Both of my parents stay sick. I've begged and pleaded, cried, gotten angry and tried to be supportive to get them to quit. Is there anything that I can actually do or say to them? Am I wasting my time?

Looking for some help from people who smoke majorly for stress reasons.

First time poster. I've looked for this subrredit to find some type of support from strangers since I feel a bit ashamed of going through it with friends and feel worried that the smokers won't incentivate me.

I started smoking very ocasionally not even a year back. I've noticed that when I rolled it mixed with weed it truly relieved my anxiety.

However, in the back of my mind I always felt it was a disgusting habit and as the stress escalated I started smoking more too. It stopped from only being on weekends just to unwind to almost everyday.

As I'm aware of the health risks, this might have beenn playing in my head because suddenly it started to feel disgusting and nauseating. 

I took it as my body's heads up to just stop altogether.

I'm wondering if some of you have other tips to help deal with anxiety and stress that doesn't involve smoking tobacco since I really want to just drop it.

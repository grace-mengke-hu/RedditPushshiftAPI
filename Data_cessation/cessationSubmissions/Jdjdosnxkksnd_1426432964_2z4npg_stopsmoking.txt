Wish I either never started or quitted... Please remind me this is worth it.

I quit a week ago and currently feel like death. I am having flu like symptoms ever since about three days in... I looked it up and it's most likely smokers/quitters flu... (I know it might be somethjg else but trust me, 99% chance of it being from quitting due to many reasons). But the part that trips me up is that I only smoked max 4 a day at my worst and only smoked for a year. 3/4 of the year was 1 cigarette or less.

It's funny because when I used to think of addiction I thought of pack a day smokers. I couldn't possibly be addicted if I don't smoke as much, right? And it couldn't be that bad for my health, right?

Wrong. I would think about smoking all the time even if I physically was not smoking. The smell of cigarettes would drive me crazy. I would look at anyone smoking in a longing way. Ever since I amped my cigarette usage because stress from school, I've been getting weird heart palpitations and chest pains and I couldn't figure out why! There were instances where my heart would feel like it was beating so fast I thought I was dying. Maybe it's because I'm tiny or my body just naturally can't tolerate nicotine and all the terrible chemicals they put in cigarettes.

I don't know but whatever it is i DEFINETELY don't crave anymore. BUT I FEEL SO SICK and bedridden and honestly, I would have rather not quit than go through these symptoms. I have two midterms tomorrow that I should be studying for but instead I'm in bed feeling like death. I'm obviously gonna keep going with this because I already made it this far and I don't want to have gotten ill from nothing but still... Please remind me this is worth it.

20 hrs in cold turkey. Does day two get better or worse.

20 hrs in and I don't feel terrible, don't feel great. I quit after reading Allen Carr's book.  I don't miss smoking terribly but I keep forgetting.  Every 5 minutes I'll Pat myself down looking for a pack only to remember I quit.  Habit, I guess.  The worse part so far is I'm supper foggy headed and spacey, as if I'd smoked a small amount of weed.  Does this improve over time, or get worse until the nicotine is out of your system.  I'm happy to be a non smoker, just curious what tomorrow's going to be like.

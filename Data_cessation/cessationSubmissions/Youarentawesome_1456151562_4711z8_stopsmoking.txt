Thoughts after few days

I’m little less than 2 weeks now, until now I have had days where I had a fuckin war in my head and few days where I barely thought about it. With little experience and lotta research I can tell a couple of points to new quitters. As people say, It’s not the 1st few days which is worst, it’s after the 1st few days you need to prepare yourself for. When the motivation goes down that’s when your craving hits you in the balls. Once a addict, always an addict is pretty much true. I don’t think craving will ever stop, Just that the intensity with which it hits are gonna be less.

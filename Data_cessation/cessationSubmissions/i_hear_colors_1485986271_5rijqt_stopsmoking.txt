One week in, chest pains and fever. Is this normal?

It's been about a week. I smoked half a pack of menthols a day as well as 3-4 marijuanas. I quit everything cold turkey around a week ago. This week I've been having bad chest pains, muscle aches and the onset of a fever. Has anyone else experienced withdrawals like this?

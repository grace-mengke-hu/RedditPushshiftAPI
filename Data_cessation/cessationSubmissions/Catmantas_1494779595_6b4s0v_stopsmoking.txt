A month in.. Help.

Guys, so ive quit cold turkey a month ago, (12/04/2017), and its been going fine not-smoking wise. A few cravings here and there the first week, and then I even kinda forgot about it, no problems whatsoever. However, it has led me on a "depression" (quoted in respect to people with actual depression), to the point of not doing any laundry or proper meals, or any kind of tidying up for the period. On top of that, my girlfriend is breaking up with me and i actually smoked the first cigarette in over a month. What can i do to not relapse, if i feel like i need to smoke, as that is the only way for me to deal with my self, bar alcohol, but that route is a no no for me. Please, id really appreciate any and all tips.

Tl;Dr Life is going to shit, i want to smoke, cant let myself in fear of dissapointing family

Anyone else feel tired all the time?

All of my quit attempts that have lasted more than 2 weeks have the same side effect- By 11AM I'm yawning a whole bunch no matter how much coffee I do or don't drink, weather I exercise or not. In the afternoon it feels like symptoms of depression as well- I just don't have any engergy to DO anything other than take a nap. Has anyone else experienced this?

Re-quit, re-fail?

5th day smoke free. This is the third time I quit in my life. The first was ridiculous: 1 month without cigarettes. The second more serious: 1 year and 2 months. Everytime the same thing: the first week of struggle, I feel really bad. Not only because of the cravings. Even my breathing is worse, and thatâ€™s funny and tragic. You know, we were better when it was worse.

Tomorrow is 4 weeks!

I’ve tried to quit roughly 9 million times and never made it past 6 months. 
This time is different though.
For starters, I did not need a special last cigarette or date to quit. I also quit soda first, which gave me some much needed encouragement.

I’ve noticed how much I hate the way smokers smell. And I feel so much calmer all the time. 

Things that have worked: going to bed earlier, meditation, thinking about how much I enjoy not smoking, talking about how much I enjoy not smoking, immediately quashing any thoughts of “I deserve a cigarette.” and hanging around people who don’t smoke.

Also water helps, a lot.

Today's the day

Hello fellow quitters/non-smokers! My quit date is tonight after work. I'm not going to try NRT yet, I'm going cold turkey. My question to you guys is how have you coped with cravings, and which ways helped you most. I've lurked around on here for a bit and even tried quitting before(I'm resetting my badge after this post), so I've read about a few techniques but would like some more input. Did you start exercising, or making lists of things to do to keep you busy?

As I said before, I have tried a few times to quit with very little success. The longest I've gone was one month, but that was years ago. Hopefully this time I will be able to stick with it!

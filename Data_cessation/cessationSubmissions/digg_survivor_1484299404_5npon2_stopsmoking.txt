I can't let go.

I can usually go without having a ciggy in the morning but still like to have at least a few puffs. I work all day without even thinking about them. But when I get home and sit down. It's what I want. I can delay the end of day ciggy if I stay active like walking the dogs or doing general house chores but I can't help it; I just want to sit. (I stand/walk for 8-9 hours a day) Basically how do I get rid of the end of day ciggs? (Also after dinner and before bed too) The very best all I can do is get down to only one before bed. How do you let go of that last one??!

Just relapsed. for the 5th time in a row. I need help

I tried quitting cold turkey about a week ago in an effort to help my lungs and reduce my spending. i was smoking about a half pack a day before. Then at a party, I drunkenly had a smoke, and another. By the end of the night i had smoke 5 cigs and had bought a pack. Now i am in very heavy withdrawal and have a pack calling to me. any advice?
TL;DR: quit, got drunk, smoked.

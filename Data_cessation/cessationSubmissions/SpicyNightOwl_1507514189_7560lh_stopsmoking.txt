The vape method

Hello all! I've posted here before when I tried quitting cold turkey in the past. Long story short, I couldn't do it. Went back to a pack a day until last week when I caved and bought a vape. That was last Thursday, it's now Sunday and since then I've smoked maybe three cigarettes total and none at all today! I feel a lot better and even though there is still a bit of craving, I think it's working well! Has anybody else had success with vaping? Are there any downsides? Thanks!

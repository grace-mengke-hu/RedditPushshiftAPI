Day 2 (even though my badge hasn't changed yet)

My badge says day 1 still, but it's actually day 2 SO YAAAY! I assume it will change and catch up shortly. I didn't drink during New Years, even though all of my drunk friends kept calling me and pestering me to come out. I just couldn't do it, I knew I would smoke. I started reading this book by Alan Carr instead. Everyone keeps recommending it. Feeling pretty good today. My boss let me stay home! I love that because it means I have another whole day to just stay stress free and enjoy that I am not smoking. 2013 is pretty much going to rule! Let's do this!

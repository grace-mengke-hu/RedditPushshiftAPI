The "discipline of freedom": My quitting story

I began being very exposed to cigarettes around 11 years ago. I was a teenager fresh out of grade 10. Almost ally friends were smoking. Everytime I'd go with them for their smoke break, I'd just chew a gum or candy. I did not take any interest in smoking during this time.

A few years went by and I became a bit more experimental, rebellious and daring. I had a new set of friends and this time, all of us were non smokers except for one. The one smoker friend introduced us to smoking and this would start 8 long years of my smoking habit. I spent most of this decade of my life smoking. I tried to quit 5 to 6 yeara ago with no lasting success. I tried vaping and almost succeded but ultimately went back to the cancer stick.

For a year now, I have been seriously contemplating on quitting. I am living on my own and need to budget my income. Smoking has been very expensive to keep up and I just wanted to feel better overall. 

I remember my mindset before I became a smoker. I have this mentality that I don"t need to depend on any substance or material thing to maintain my happiness or sanity. I've always been that way since childhood. I do not drink coffee, have not tried drugs and I am generally repulsed by being bound to any habit, contract or even loan. I love to be free in  a way that I have the option to make drastic changes in my life anytime. This freedom mindset has helped me in my quit journey. I did not love smoking. I used it as a crutch. It became a bondage. It came to a point that the habit was holding me back. I hate being held back. I knew I had to let go. I wanted to let go of the habit. And so I did.

Everytime I get a strong but brief mental craving, I firmly say no. The further I get from the last cigarette I smoked, the less I get the cravings. 

It has poured over to other areas in my life. I am starting to quit dairy and refined sugars in my diet.

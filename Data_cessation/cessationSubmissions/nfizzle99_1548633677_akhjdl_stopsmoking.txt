1 month clean — how do I disassociate certain activities with smoking so I don’t get cravings while doing them?

After I switched from cigs to a JUUL, I would do it constantly while doing certain activities. The one that drove me to make this post was playing PS4. I haven’t been able to play PS4 for about a month and now that I have the opportunity, I sat down and instantly had an intense craving because my mind instinctively associated the PS4 with using my JUUL. How can I try to redirect these kinds of cravings so that I can enjoy those activities again?

Tomorrow is 40 days!

I'm still using lozenges, but went down from 4mg to 2mg.  I'm feeling strong still, but still having urges.  It's a little strange.  I want to smoke, but I don't want a cigarette.   I think now, I miss the habit of having something to do when bored.  I've gained about 15 pounds, going to be working on that soon.  

I feel.... strong.  And proud.  But know I can never have even a drag, I already did that on my last quit after 9 months and still kick myself over that!

I hope everyone is hanging in there!  The accomplishment and freedom I feel is awesome!  And I can totally tell I'm saving money!  Keep it up fellow gainers (not quitters, bc we are gaining so many things, not losing anything!)

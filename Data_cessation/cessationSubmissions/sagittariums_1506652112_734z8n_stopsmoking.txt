2 Weeks Smoke Free!

I don't have much to say other than that! I'm very proud of myself, it's been really hard but at I can't believe it's already been this long. 

I never thought that I could do it. And then one day I was running out of cigarettes, my account was in overdraft, and I was panicking over what I would do when I ran out. After browsing this subreddit, I figured I should try quitting again. 

Look at me now!

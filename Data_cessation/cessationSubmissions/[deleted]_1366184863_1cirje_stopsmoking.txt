I need help, Reddit.

I need to stop. But I know I can't do it. I need help. 
Ill try to keep it short. 
I'm 18, been smoking since I was 14. 
I have severe anxiety, and pretty bad depression. So I get addicted to anything that is even slightly addicting. Smoking, Drinking, Food(Im not overweight luckily), Fapping(TMI sorry). 
I dont have a job currently, but somehow I always get 5 bucks for a pack. But it controls my life, as soon as I open the pack I start dreading running out and not having money for another pack. Its ridiculous. 
I have slight anger issues so I know that will come up if I dont smoke. It will make my anxiety and depression worse Im sure. 
I know no one can tell me how to quit, because there is no sure fire way, but how can I do it? I want my next pack to be my last.

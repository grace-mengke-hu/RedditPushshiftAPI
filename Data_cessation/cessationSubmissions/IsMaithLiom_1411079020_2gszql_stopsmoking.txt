Here I go. Just put out what is hopefully my last smoke ever

I'm 24, been smoking 6 years and I've just said enough is enough. I want to get fit and I simply cannot do that being a smoker. I'll take it one day at a time. I'll drop in here everyday to read your stories and share any tips I've found useful. You guys/girls are great. I wish everyone the best of luck.

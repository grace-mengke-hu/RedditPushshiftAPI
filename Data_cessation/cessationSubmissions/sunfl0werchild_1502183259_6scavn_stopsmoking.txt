Day 8 in starting over...

I made it 2 months and then asked a friend for a cigarette to "prove how disgusting it was" and suffice to say, that idea was silly. I was off to the races. I've started over, and it has now been 8 days. Starting over was rough, but I'm glad I did it. I just wanted to get on here as a way for f reaffirming my accountability because looking at these posts of like-minded people really does help. I'm around people who chain smoke all the time with my closest friends. So, the temptation is always around me and can really look appealing sometimes. 
So, I'm really glad this is here. Thank you. ðŸ’œ

Smoker's Flu

I feel like I am dying. The emotional side has been FINE. I mean, cravings are minimal. I am pretty emotionally stable. But I have a chizzle running through my skull as we speak. I can't breathe. I am dizzy. I almost vomited. It's just getting worse.

What can I do? I tried Ibuprofen but to no avail.  Last time I tried to quit, this is what happened, and it just got worse and worse.

I'm just in so much pain right now. Is there anything you have done to help with this?

Stopped 4 days ago, it's hard but I'm feeling better!

I've been smoking for 7 years now, rolling my own cigarettes with the strongest tobacco available. Because when I started when I was 15, I thought is was super cool to smoke. And even cooler to roll them yourself without filter.

Now I've finally found a good reason for myself to quit smoking! I've started playing rugby 2 years ago now, and I don't seem to be getting any better for the last year now. The only thing (and it's a big thing) I think is in my way of getting better is smoking. So I just quit smoking!

Wrong.. It's proving to be very difficult and it has only been 4 days now. I even downloaded an app which counts the cigarettes not smoked, and shows how much money you saved. I plan to treat myself with new headphones once I save the amount of money needed to buy them. (I've been wanting them for quite some time now)

I've tried to quit once before, it didn't last, obviously. I think it had to do with me not socializing with my smoker-friends anymore while quitting. I know that sounds contradicting, but not seeing them made me feel like I didn't really have any friends. Because they were (and still are) my best friends. Feeling like not having friends caused me to start smoking again. So now I just do the same thing on a night out as I did when I smoked. Tagging along with the little trips outside and talking like I would when I was a smoker. The only difference, I do not smoke anymore. At least, that is the plan!

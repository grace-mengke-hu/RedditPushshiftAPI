Made it through a ski trip; feeling grateful

Today was the first day I've really struggled. I spent the day skiing with a couple friends, one of which is a smoker. As we took a break at the top, my buddy lit a cigarette and I had to steel myself against asking for one. There was something about being at the top of the slopes, with the crisp air and the joy of the day, that made it look so tempting. I made a comment to him along the lines of what I was thinking, and he said to me: "Ulysses_s_Goblin, that first cigarette you smoke after you haven't smoked in a while is never as satisfying as you think it will be. You have to smoke a couple, and then after that, you're back to where you started. It's better to just not have one at all." He then took another drag of his cigarette.

I feel very lucky to have such a supportive friend, and am very happy I didn't smoke a cigarette today.

Hope you all are having a good day!

Home for holiday and everyone is smoking

I guess I just wanna rant, but I am home for holiday, in an Eastern European country, so most of my friends and family smoke. 

I quit at the end of this summer exactly when I left my home country to go back to college, in the Netherlands, and this is the first time I am home again, and also the first time I am struggling the most not to smoke. I don’t wanna chill by myself when my family smokes so I join them but I have to say the smell is killing me. It’s the first time I can’t breathe when someone is smoking and I realize how it’s like being a non-smoker in a smoking room. That kinda makes me happy cause I get a bit grossed by it. But I feel a bit nostalgic that I cannot join my friends or family for a smoke. 

I also feel like my family does not realize how hard giving up smoking was for me as they think I smoked for a couple years not the reality of 7 years, so they are never really acknowledge me as a person that just gave up smoking. I also do not want to make a big deal out of it and just try to go on as usual. 

Although my friends have been better and I have noticed they try to not smoke as much, I still feel weird that I cannot join them.

Again this is mostly a ranting post, as I was expecting this as I was used to smoke here and my brain didn’t have time to dissociate the environment, as in the case of the Netherlands. I will not smoke as I am to happy with my progress now, I am just a bit afraid of New Years Eve, but I know I will manage. 

Anyway Merry Christmas everyone and keep going!!!

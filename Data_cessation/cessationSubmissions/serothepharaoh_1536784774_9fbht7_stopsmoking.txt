I really need to quit.

My pack a day habit for the past 10 years has developed into a 1 1/2 to 2 packs a day in the last few months. It's gotten out of hand, I have a constant throat clearing I have always done that drives everyone around me crazy and as you can imagine that definitely hasn't improved.

It's the most uncontrollable when I'm driving and on breaks at work. I'll smoke 2, occasionally 3 cigs every break in 10 minutes. It's disgusting. I'm over it and I don't know what to do..

Patches haven't worked. I've tried vaping with high end equipment, and I hate gum.

75% of me is done with every aspect of it, but the other 25% wants to chainsmoke as its on 3 of the few things that preoccupies my mind from anxiety.

Open to all criticism and advice.

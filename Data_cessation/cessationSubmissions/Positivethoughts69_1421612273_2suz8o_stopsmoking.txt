I can do this!!!

I've smoked off and on for the last 9 years.  I tried quiting last year and that lasted for about two weeks.  It's been 17 days and cigarette free:) It's tougher then I thought it would be. After a couple of days of cold turkey... I felt I needed some help and started chewing Nicotine gum every now and then when I get an intense craving.

My boyfriend, my kids and my family hated that I smoked. But I have to do this for ME and no one else.

Smoking sucks now

but I still crave it. On Feb 22nd I had quit smoking with my two friends, two of us have failed after two months. Smoking now after those two months of being smoke free sucks, it's more degrading and brings more guilt. I can't take it, every time i buy a pack i smoke like half of it then throw it out saying I'm going to quit. The cravings are horrible, I want a cigarette so bad, but once I have one, I feel HORRIBLE.

I will now be quitting today as of May 17th

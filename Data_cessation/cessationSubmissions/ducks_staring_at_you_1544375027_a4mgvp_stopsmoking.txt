Today is the day.

I quit smoking last January, after 5 years of smoking, and I was able to hold on that until August and I relapsed. The summer was great before the relapse, I was happy and in a good mood and I felt light. Hell, I even practiced yoga daily. 

I have now smoked 5 months, because of the relapse. I feel like a shit. For a month, every time I have smoked, I feel disgusted and asthmatic. My blood pressure goes up and down and everything feels so horrible. 

Now it ends, I beat it once so I can do it again. I want to feel light and healthy again. Send positive vibes, this is hella of fight.

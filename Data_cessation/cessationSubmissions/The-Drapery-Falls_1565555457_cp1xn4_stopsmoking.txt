Pretty disappointed in myself

From April until about late July I didn't smoke at all, which is almost 4 months. I had tried to quit many times before, but it never worked. One day I went out for a smoke and it just disgusted me to the point of wanting to vomit, so I threw my pack out and didn't even think about it. Smoking didn't cross my mind for those entire 4 months and it was out of my life. It felt so simple.


Recently, I reconvened with a friend group I haven't spent time with in a while. We would all hang out on a buddy's patio and they would all pull packs out and just smoke and chill in a circle. I got offered one and I thought "fuck it, it's not gonna do anything. I quit so easily and I'm gonna be okay". I continued to smoke with this group for a couple weeks and I eventually found myself buying a pack of my own and smoking in my own time, back to the old habit/addiction. 


I train in a combat sport and do other exercises such as running and weightlifting from time to time. I've noticed a huge degradation in my cardiovascular ability. I feel winded running up the stairs to my apartment, whereas before I could do it perfectly. My breaths are shallower, and I'm absolutely out of breath after my intense training sessions. I've also noticed a lower baseline mood overall. Basically nothing good is coming from this.


I know what I have to do - I just have to tell myself I'm gonna stop and not succumb to peer pressure. I'm not gonna lie by saying I don't enjoy the "culture" of smoking and hanging out with friends, because that's the time when I feel the most inclined to do it. I guess the biggest obstacle for me is gonna be to be around smokers and be able to say no consistently. I don't have much else to say, just wanted to rant and get this off my chest I guess. I've failed myself and I've failed you all as well.

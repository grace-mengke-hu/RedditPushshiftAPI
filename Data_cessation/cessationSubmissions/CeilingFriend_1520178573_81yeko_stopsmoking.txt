Things I have learned in my quit journey: (I posted this as a reply, but thought I would share as a post too)

- urges are not a command. I can acknowledge, not fear, and let the urge pass
- the more urges/cravings I do not act on, the less frequent and less intense they are
- eventhough I had avoided smoking while drinking, it makes me nervous and best for me now to not drink again for a while
- smoking will not help anything. It will add to the problem (nicotine addiction withdrawal cycle)
- if I am dealing with a negative emotion, smoking will make it worse. I will still have that feeling plus shame for having caved.
- besides the health and monetary gains, being free is the greatest feeling

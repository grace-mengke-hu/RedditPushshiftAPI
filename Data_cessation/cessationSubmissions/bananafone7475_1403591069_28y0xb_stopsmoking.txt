Newbie here, wanna quit, I'd love some tips. Please.

So I want to quit, I've tried many times, but always rationalize starting up again ('Oh, I'll only smoke when I drink', 'I'm young, I'll quit later', so on and so forth). What has helped y'all quit when you first started? Right now, I'm trying to just slow down, but is it better/easier to just quit? I know it's different for everyone, but I'd love some stories and tips.

Intense cravings again after 15 months

This sucks! It's been getting better, but it was touch and go on relapsing for a few days there. I've been depressed is about the only reason I can think why. In the past cigarettes were (of course) my first go-to for coping with feelings like that. 

The things that I bear down on and think about are: 1) I can't even kid myself, if I buy a pack I am going to smoke all of it and probably buy a second pack and be at huge risk of just becoming a two-pack-a-day human ashtray again and 2) I believe that re-quitting to avoid that is going to be pretty hard. Like, if I am wanting to smoke so badly now, isn't that feeling going to be a lot worse after I give in and then try to quit again? 3) Can I imagine I would ever look back, in later years, and say "Yeah, I sure am glad I went back to smoking after that time I quit for nearly a year and a half"? LOL no, not really. 

Has anyone else had a return of  cravings to smoke in the second year of quitting?

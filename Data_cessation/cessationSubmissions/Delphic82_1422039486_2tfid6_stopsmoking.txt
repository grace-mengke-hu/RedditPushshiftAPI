Slipped on my initial NYE quit, but stuck with it, today is 2 weeks, thanks to this subreddit

I have been reading this subreddit for 3-4 months, and finally, I tried to quit on New Year's day, day 3 and 4 was too tough, so I slipped for a few days.  Got Allen Carr's book, kept reading this forum, and today is 2 weeks since my last one.  I have tried quitting with gum, ecigs, medication, etc.... I can't believe I have quit by simply reading a book and other people's stories.  It wouldn't have been possible without this forum, I wouldn't have learned about the book or had the motivation to quit.  Thanks stopsmoking!

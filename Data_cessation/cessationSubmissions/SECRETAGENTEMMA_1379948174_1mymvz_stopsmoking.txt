Best Iphone Quit Smoking App

Hi everyone - this is a wonderful subreddit that helped me quit for a month last year. I'm ready to take the plunge now. I trust you all, and I'm putting my trust into your support but first I need your help!

I would like an iphone app to quit smoking. What's the best one? I've been recommended My Last Cigarette. Is that any good? I would like one with strong, eye-catching graphics and reliable track-keeping (nicotine levels, $$$ saving, cigarette count, disease lower measurer). This is for my boyfriend and I - he quit smoking today too. What do you guys use, and what app has proved to be most helpful?

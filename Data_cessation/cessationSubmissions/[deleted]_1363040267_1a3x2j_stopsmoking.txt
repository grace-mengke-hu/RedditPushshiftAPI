Afraid of gaining weight.

Hey everyone, currently reading Allan's book and preparing to give up this vile addiction. But I wanted to share my main fear and get some feedback. 

As a former chubby kid who currently sits at a healthy weight, I have obvious lingering fears when it comes to gaining weight. And the biggest obstacle that keeps me smoking has always been the idea that I will fill the nicotine hole with food. 

I know this fear is pretty damn shallow, considering I know the health risks, I spend an absurd amount of money on cigarettes and am do myself zero favors by continuing to smoke. Yet there is always this voice in the back of my head whispering "if you quit, you'll get fat, and you'll hate yourself then relapse having gained nothing." 

I know this is nothing but vanity, I would really appreciate any stories and experience you guys could share with your experience with quitting and weight gain, and how to combat it.

Quit Date is June 1st, any tips?

I set a quit date a while back for June first and I'm just wondering if anyone has any pro-tips or special tricks that helped them out?

I know about getting rid of anything in my home, I have a good support system and a good mentality about it.  However, more advice can't hurt!

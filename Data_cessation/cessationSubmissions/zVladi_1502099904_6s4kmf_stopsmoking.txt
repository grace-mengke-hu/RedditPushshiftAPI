Smoking and Boxing

Punch guys, I've been practicing taek-wan-do for 5 years and kickboxing for half of a year(not a big deal) From 1 week now Ive started boxing after 2 years of doing nothing. In a week I went to 4 trainings. I have a problem and its about smoking, in those 2 years I was a heavy smoker and I gained over 15kg of fat. Now ofcourse when im practicing box i'm sweating as hell like never, I also use the barbell for my triceps and chest, i use the dumbbell for my back and hands. But I'm still smoking like 10 cigs per day, I want to gain my mass back and to get off this fat off my stomach. I also use benzodiazepines to relax my self and calm my self, does this acts somehow? Im eating regularly 5 times per day a lot of proteins and carbohydrates also vitamines, do you guys think I will make it even with smoking? 75 KG ATM
 EDIT : I bougt some menthol gum wth 4mg nicotine in it, should it help?

Quit smoking using Juul Pods. Can anyone relate?

First off, I know the best way to quit is cold turkey. I'm tired of smelling like cigarettes and people telling me so. However, I'm a surveyor and my job requires me to be in the field where I end up doing a lot of sitting around twiddling my thumbs. I figured it would be easier to use juul pods because I can start to wein myself from the 5% down to 3% and then down to 1%. 

After two months I've tried to switch from the 5% to the 3%, but it's not the same. The thing I enjoy the most about smoking is the harshness in my throat when I inhale. I get this with the 5%, but not the 3%. 

Anyone else have this issue? Has anyone else tried to quit this way?

After 7 months of gradually lowering my vape's nictoine level, I've finished my first day of 0 nic!

7 months ago, I replaced my smoking with vaping. The transition was immediate and I never looked back (except two cigarettes I couldn't even finish cause they tasted so bad compared to my vape). I've gone from 15mg, to 12, 6, 3, 2, 1, and today ZERO. And it wasn't even difficult because I was barely getting any nic at 1mg so no withdrawals. 

Finally, I feel like I'm free from nicotine. I don't think I'm free of the habit, because I'm still using my vape as a crutch, but I am nicotine free! 

Thankfully, nicotine free vapor tastes like you're vaping out of a burnt wick 24/7, so I feel like I'll be able to make the last jump easily ish.

It took 7 months, but I've done it!  I never, ever thought I'd be able to kick nicotine. It's my first nicotine free day in about three years. üçª

48 hours nicotine free.

I haven't had a cigarette in almost two weeks, but I've been keeping the nicotine habit with dip and ecigs. My plan was to ween myself off cigarettes and then quit cold turkey. No more vapes, and I just threw a 3/4 full can of dip in the trash. I'm done with poisoning myself. I feel awful. Lump in my throat, my appetite is through the roof and I keep eating myself sick. The anxiety is the worst part. Sometimes it feels like a hundred pound weight is on my chest and I can't breathe. My sinuses will close up and I can't breathe out of my nose, and that gives me a panic attack almost every time it happens. This sucks. But for the first time in almost five years I don't want a cigarette. I just want these withdrawls to stop so I can go out and get on with my life. How long is this going to last?

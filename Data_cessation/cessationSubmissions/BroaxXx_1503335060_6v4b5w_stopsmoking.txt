16 hours into my first day.

I started Varenicline (Chantix/Champix) treatment last week and last night I smoked my final cigarette (you're supposed to smoke for a week while on the treatment). This time I feel stopped *for real* but it's hard. The meds really really help to sooth some of the symptoms but it's not "easy" either. 


Right now I'm taking champix and using SmokeFree app to log everything. Writing about my cravings seems to help a little and bubble gum does the rest. I'm also taking a lot of chamomile tea. My doctor also prescribed some mild anxiolytic meds to take on "emergencies" but I'm trying to avoid those as much as possible. 



My face, cheeks and hands feel dormant. I'm jittery and nervous. But the intensity of my last too cravings has been decreasing. Last time I tried to stop smoking I didn't last for 12 hours so at least I managed that far and I'm on track to complete my first day.


Sadly I wasn't able to get a doctor's appointment in time for a refill of champix. I hope I don't need it. A lot of people seem to be OK with only two weeks of treatment. 


I just wanted to share that. I feel my mood swinging a lot. Happy &gt; normal &gt; angry &gt; anxious &gt; sad &gt; depressed &gt; happy again! I feel like I'm going crazy. But soon the worst will be over. Just a couple of weeks. 


Sorry for the rant. Just taking shit off my chest. I wish I could kick my 21 year old self on the teeth for starting to smoke. Asshole...

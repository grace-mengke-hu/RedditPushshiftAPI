5 days and not smoke free ðŸ˜ª

After 11 years of smoking, I decided to quite 5 days ago becz of some chest pain( nothing came out in the tests, thankfully) spoke to a pulmonologist for the first time and admitted to myself that I have to end this. From 16 a day, Iâ€™m trying to go cold turkey, but Iâ€™m unable to resist, giving in at 3-4 times a day! I have to stop puffing!!!!

Made it 2 weeks and through my 21st birthday without a cigarette

I'm sure this time it's going to be the real deal. Not only am I motivated to keep myself from smoking, I feel no urge to smoke: all I can think of is the racing heart and nausea. I've been smoking for 5 years, on and off for the last 6 months. Things are looking bright this time around, I just know it.

Hey guys, I need some help.

So, I'm 19 days in and the cravings are stronger than ever, even stronger than the first week. I feel like crying at the drop of a hat, I want a cigarette so fucking bad. I keep imagining taking a puff, inhaling, and then feeling that light headed feeling. I want it so bad!!! I don't know why it is so hard at this point. I thought the worst was over. I don't want to smoke, I know it's bad, but my brain keeps telling me to just try one, just one last one, JUST ONE!! I want it to stop. I can't give in to this. Please help me. I am trying to stay strong but I could easily go on a break and buy a pack and it's all I am thinking about.

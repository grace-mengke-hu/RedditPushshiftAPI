Any tips for (single) parents?

I’ve been trying to quite for coming up two weeks now, and I’m failing pretty miserably. Any help or tips (especially from parents) would be very appreciated! 

I’m a single parent, when my kids are at school/Nursery or in bed at night, I’m really finding it easy. I’m still getting cravings, but I can do things to distract myself and get past them.

When they aren’t though, it is so so difficult. Particularly after the school pick up is the hardest. They do a combination of talking incessantly at me/moaning/not listening/ crying/fighting. The peace and space I had to work through a craving is gone. I can’t just go out for a walk (because I’d have to bring them and they’re already tired and hungry and grumpy), I can’t write a shopping list or whatever because they just keep going (moaning etc). Then I end up snapping at them and feel awful. 

And trying to remind myself I’m partly quitting for them, doesn’t work when I’m irritated and they’re driving me insane. 

Right now, I’ve ended up leaving a pack at a neighbours, and I pick one up from them just before we get home from school. Whilst only having one a day is way better than the 20 I was having, I really want to have none at all.

So please, if anybody has any tips to help, I’ll be forever in your debt.

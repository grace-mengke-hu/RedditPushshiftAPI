Planning to Quit.

I had my first cig at age 14, and was up to a pack per day by 18.  I quit when I was 20, cold turkey, for 4 solid years.

Then, I had a drag.  And then I bummed one.  And then i bought a pack.

Fast forward 4 more years and countless attempts to quit.  My wife is sick of us smoking (me especially because I smoke twice as much as her easily).

I know I can do it, but i'm really scared.  We've set Friday as the last day.  I'm going to go burn one after writing this because of the anxiety it's causing me. 

Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.  I have nicotine gum ready to go, healthy snacks and exercise plans but I know that as soon as I say I'm done, the URGE will take over again.

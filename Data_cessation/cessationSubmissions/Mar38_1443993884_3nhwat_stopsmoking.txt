6 days and counting.

After 21 years of smoking I have quit. Its not easy but it's also not as hard as i thought it would be so far. So I'm waiting.... waiting for the intense cravings, waiting for the withdrawal systems, waiting to get ill from the toxins leaving my body. But this will all be a sign that my body is recovering. So ill stay positive, keep using the smoke free app and hopefully ill never smoke again. This community is really inspiring thanks to everyone for sharing.

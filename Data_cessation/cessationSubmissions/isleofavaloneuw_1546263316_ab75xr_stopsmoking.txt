I messed up

I started smoking when I was 14 years old and quit last July because my mother stopped too.
But I lied to myself thinking I could go out with other people drinking and smoking without doing so myself.

I wasn't prepared to go out and around temptation. I even bought a pack today because I'm so weak, I already smoked 2 and gave 2 away. 

But tomorrow no more, this time I think I'm ready. I know what it takes to quit. Hell I did it for 3 months and didn't look back.

I know the weeks to come won't be easy but I prepared myself. I subscribed to a boxing gym and I'm commited. I bought a vape for if/when I go out.

My consumption of cigarettes is heavily tied to drinking so I will need to cut back by a lot.
But that's good. Smoking doesnt make me happy it never did. I'm just sinking money into it because I'm stupid.

When I speak to my friends that are smokers they never remember why they started smoking. Which is why it is so much more futile.

Tomorrow I will return to being a non smoker and I wish you all the best for the year to come! 

Happy new year everyone and without a puff

I wish you all the best

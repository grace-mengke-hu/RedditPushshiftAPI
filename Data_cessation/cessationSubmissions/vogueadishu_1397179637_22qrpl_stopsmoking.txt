Quit date is set for April 18th

I've been smoking for 18 years. I started when I was 13, smoke about a pack a day. I will be child free for 4 days so I feel like it's the best time to try and quit. 

I smoke a pack a day. I want to save the money from cigarettes to get my tubes untied, because my SO and I want to try for a baby. 

Any tips? Tricks? I don't have any patches or gum or anything... Trying for cold turkey. Any advice is welcome. 

Edit - spelling.

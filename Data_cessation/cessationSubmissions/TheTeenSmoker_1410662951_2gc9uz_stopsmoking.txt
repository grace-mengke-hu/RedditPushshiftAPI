Im a teen smoker in need of some advice.

Hey guys I'm seventeen and I've been smoking ever since I was fourteen, today was the last day I'll ever smoke. The reason for this is because my addiction has been kept a secret from everyone including my closest friends. I started smoking because back in seventh grade I moved to a kinda bad neighborhood and became friends with with the bad kids who smoke, ever since then I haven't been able to kick the habit. I have a girlfriend and we've been together for nine months and I don't love her because I'm too young to know what love is but she is what makes me happy. Today I had to go to work and I drive a motor scooter because I don't have my license. On my way to work someone beeped at me and I thought nothing of it but when I got home I facetimed my girlfriend and she asked me all kinds of questions like what was I wearing and when did I go to work and as a good liar I told her the opposite if what she told me. I don't know what to do, this is the closest thing I've ever experienced to love and I don't want it all crashing down because of my lies and addiction. I'm going cold turkey, I just broke all of my cigs and all of my lighters so that problem is out of the way but could any one help me with my girlfriend dilemma? I'm asking this sub because I'm hoping someone has had the same experience as me and could give their opinion.

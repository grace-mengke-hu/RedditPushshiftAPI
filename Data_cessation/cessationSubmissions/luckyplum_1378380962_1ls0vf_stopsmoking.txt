Anyone else get really sick after two weeks?

After 20+ years of smoking, these last two weeks have been terrific for me. With the taste and smell and energy I have I feel like every aspect of my life as improved. I'm cold turkey and getting my mind straight about what I want in life has changed everything. I can say I don't even really want it anymore, and even though I'm only 12 days, I know there's not way I will ever go back. Not one single puff.

Anyway, I'd been feeling great, but today got horribly, horribly sick. I was freezing and shaking and sweating. Feverish. Had to go home from work. I tried to eat some soup but couldn't keep anything down.

Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else around the 2-week mark or if I just happened to catch the mother of all flu.

It's so weird to me to think that just a few weeks ago, I would have been still craving and wanting to poison myself even when I'm this sick.

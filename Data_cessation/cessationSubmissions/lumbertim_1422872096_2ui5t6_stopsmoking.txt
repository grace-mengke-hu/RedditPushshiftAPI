My sixth first day

Hey everyone,

This is my first post on this subreddit, and I'm so glad that I found it. It seems like a very friendly and helpful community. Exactly what I've been looking for.  

I'm 23 years old and unfortunately I started smoking 10 years ago. I always thought that I enjoyed it, but after reading Allen Carr's book I realised that I really don't. So I decided to join you guys in not smoking. The thing is, I find it kind of easy to not smoke during the day, but when evening comes I lose all motivation to quit. I can get up in the morning and really promise myself that I won't smoke, but then later on the day no amount of logic seems to get to me. It's like I don't care about quitting anymore. It's so strange, because withdrawal seems too be really mild for me. Still, I always end up not keeping the promise I made to myself, because I somehow convinced myself that I don't care about not smoking. 

So this will be my sixth first day of not smoking.  I will keep on going and beat this thing. 

I hope you all have a great day! Stay strong!!

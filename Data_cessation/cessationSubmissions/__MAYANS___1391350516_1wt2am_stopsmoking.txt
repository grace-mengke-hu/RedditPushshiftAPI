Last night was really tough, but I'm glad I made it.

I was out having a beer with a (smoker) friend, and after that freaking awesome sandwich I ate, the cravings were really tough - I could have asked for a cigarette when ever I wanted, and I was even offered a few times, I don't think I would have made it without support from some close people and you guys here, so thanks for the support so far, you are awesome.

I know it's only 3 days, but I feel good about myself.

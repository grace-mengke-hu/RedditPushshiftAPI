1 and a half day and fighting

Im about 40ish hours without a cigarette. I've been smoking for 15years, lately a pack a day. 

Nicotine withdrawal bites me hard. I have a job where we do a lot of calculations and today my brain just froze during an episode, i simply couldn't think. 

This evening I went for a walk and had nausia attack in middle of street (im fine now). I felt like im not able to walk streight.

It grabbed me so hard, but Im not letting go! Best feeling after nicotine attack, when i know that it is really nothing, just a few chemicals fighting in my body.

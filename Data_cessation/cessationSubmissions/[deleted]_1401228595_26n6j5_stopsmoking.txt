Day 1

I was a half a pack a day smoker for over 10 years, just recently it's been up to 1 pack a day.  Haven't had a cigarette in over 18 hours.  Not feeling *too* awful, just very agitated, irritable, tired, & can't stop thinking about having a cigarette, the worst symptom of all!

I've been drinking a lot of fruit juice, water, and eating fruits and small snacks, chewing on toothpicks, etc.  I've been avoiding caffeine, as well, since I always have my cigarette with coffee.  So I'm going through caffeine withdrawals on top of it and just feel like sleeping all day.  I imagine it'll be worse tomorrow and the next, but I'm ready for it!  

I live with heavy smokers, so this is going to make it even more difficult.  I've been having to avoid them as much as possible throughout the day, which kind of sucks!  Wish me luck!

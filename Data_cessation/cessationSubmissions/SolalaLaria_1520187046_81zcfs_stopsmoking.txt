First 24 hours have been...interesting

I'm an emotional roller coaster, going from excitement to depression to anger and again being happy. I NEVER want to go through this again so this needs to stick. Right now I'm in anger stage....
Also have a super fun toddler at home with me who probably thinks I'm a crazy person. Crying, laughing, snippy, running in place to distract myself... also randomly shouting "I'm a non-smoker!!" Yeah she is probably pretty confused...rant over thanks guys for being here

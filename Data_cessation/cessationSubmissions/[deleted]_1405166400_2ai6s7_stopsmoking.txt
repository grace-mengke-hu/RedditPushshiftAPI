Fell off the wagon, but climbed right back on

I had a stressful day yesterday. After 9 days I caved and got a pack of cigarettes. I smoked a half of one and was like "nope! This is gross!" And I put it out and gave the pack to a friend.

Ten days today! My niece says she is going to reward me with candy and my daughter is super thrilled that Mom is a non-smoker now.

First Bouncing Shift w/o a dart in almost 10 years

I am a bartender who quit smoking about 1.5 months ago. I was a bouncer for 9 years before I began bartending a few years back.  I was known for smoking multiple darts at a time after a fight. A girl threw up on my last night and i had to fight the need to smoke; but made it through the night without smoking. After years of a pack and a half a day it feels good not to be shackled to my vices anymore

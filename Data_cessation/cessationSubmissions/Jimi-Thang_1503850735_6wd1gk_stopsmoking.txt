After quitting, getting back in shape

I have made it 6 weeks without a cigarette. Now, I looking to roll this positive life change into more than just quitting smoking. I want to get back in shape. I used to run and bike when I was in my 20s, but the smoking made that harder and harder until I gave up. Anyone have some tips for getting back in shape after smoking? I'm 33, so definitely still young enough to do strenuous activities. It has just been so long that I don't know where to start. I don't want to over do it early on.

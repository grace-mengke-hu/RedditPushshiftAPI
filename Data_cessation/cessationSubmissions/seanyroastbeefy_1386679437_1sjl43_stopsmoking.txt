It's all about finding your reason...

So I posted last week about quitting for love. I needed a way for people to take me more serious, more specifically my wife. We've been separated 6 months. I'm trying to show her I can change, so I quit smoking. It's been a whole week since I've even taken a drag! I still drink and hang with smokers, but it's getting easier :-) This is my best start other than boot camp 6 years ago! Just came to say that as a smoker of 12 years, I finally figured out how to quit. It's all mental! Find your reason! Best of luck, I wish you the best of luck in quitting!

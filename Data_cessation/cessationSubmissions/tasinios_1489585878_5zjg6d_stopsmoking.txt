What exactly happened to me.

I quit smoking 6 months ago.I am 21 years old male.Was smoking for 6 years.I cant recall any serious withdrawl symptoms when i first quit.It was relatively easy for me.I only had some suicidal thoughts + insomnia for a couple of days and that was it.Lately i have not been myself.I got anxious and stressed.My blood pressure has been a little bit high.Nothing too serious though.I have also been having stingy sensations on my chest and arms for the past month which got me really scared.Went to the cardiologist had some test and seems that i am fine.I still have the pinches on my chest and arms.I now believe it is probably due to muscle spasms due to stress or something nerve related.I really dont know.All in all i am not in a good psychogical condition lately and i am feeling a bit off.So today after 6 months of smoking i went ahead and bought a pack because i thought it might destress me.I was going back and forth to reach the market because i wasnt sure if i really wanted that.Bought the pack.Light 1 up.Harsh on my trhoat even though i smoked it whole.I smoked 3 in total in a period of 8 hours.The 3rd one was 2 hours ago.I dont feel the need to smoke any right now.Nothing changed.I thought that my mood being off was due to my long term cessation even though first months was all good.Anyone experienced something similar?Not feeling good?Like bored all the time?Not wanting to do anything?Not finding meaning to anything?

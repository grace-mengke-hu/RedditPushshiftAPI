There's Never a Good Time To Quit - Every Day is a Fabulous Time To Quit!!!

I keep hearing this ad on the radio about weight loss - "There's never a good time to lose weight..." I think the same about smoking. I've used the excuses before...I'm job hunting, my kids are stressing me out, I'm going through a health scare, I'm tight on funds (the last two being the BEST reasons TO quit!). We've all been there. There will always be stress, disappointment, the need to 'reward' yourself, the need for a 'coping mechanism'....difficulties, self-doubt. So just quit. 

My 82 year old mother smoked for 48 years and finally quit when she was 65 and her life was nearly completely stress-free. Every day she tells me how proud of me she is because I quit a little more than two weeks ago. She tells me it's the BEST thing I will ever do for myself. She wishes she would've quit when she was much younger. 

So - every single day is a great day to quit. Just don't smoke for today. Let tomorrow worry about itself. Anybody can not smoke for one whole day. Then tomorrow do it again. Just keep putting one foot in front of another. You won't regret it!!

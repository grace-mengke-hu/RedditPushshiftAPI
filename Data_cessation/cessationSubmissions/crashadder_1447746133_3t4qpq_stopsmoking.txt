yay i've got a star

I can't believe i made it . I am incredibly happy. I am so used to be a non smoker that i don't even feel like i should treat myself with anything. I've promised myself that i'd go to an apple store and buy me an iPad or something but i guess i won't. quitting alone is the best gift. please don't fall into the same trap again. being a smoker is hell lot difficult than being a non-smoker.

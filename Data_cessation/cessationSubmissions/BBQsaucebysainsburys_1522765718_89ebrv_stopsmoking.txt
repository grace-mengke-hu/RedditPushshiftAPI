Help! I'm going to be in danger tomorrow and need your advice!

So basically, tonight/tomorrow I will be doing something which I've managed to avoid for like 18 or so days, so far. I'll be going on a trip, where I'll be mostly alone (or with strangers), and then drinking with smoker friends in the evening. Being alone on a trip away from home AND being with my smoker friends are my two single biggest trigger situations. I'm leaving tonight and I'm already thinking to myself "how will I get through this?"

The worse thing is that I've not found these 18 days particularly difficult (not to brag, it's just been easier this time than it has for me before) and so I'm thinking that I'd EASILY be able to quit again after the trip is over. I'm trying to make myself think "I might as well smoke, since it'll be hard to resist, and I'll be able to go back to quitting after - in terms of health and money, it wont be too big a difference" 

BUT, if I give into that, while it might not cost me much compared to what I've already saved, and health-wise what are twenty more cigs, the real problem is how do I stop myself from letting myself smoke EVERY time I see these friends, or go away? I need to get into a position where my two options aren't "Avoid the situation" or "smoke" I need to change the way I deal with the situation.

I really don't want to, but I can feel myself giving in. Any words of advice??

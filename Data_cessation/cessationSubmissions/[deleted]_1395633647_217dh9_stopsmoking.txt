What do you guys think of smoking cigars?

So I am 21 y/o, a heavy smoker for the last 4 years at least. I have tried and failed at quitting several times before but finally think I've broken it by staying completely clean cold turkey for just over 3 months.

However:

Recently I've taken a liking to cigars. I've always had an addictive personality and a strong oral fixation and I like how I can puff on one for 20-30 minutes. I'm not inhaling ever and I'm not talking about black and milds. But I treat my nicotine recovery as a dope addicts or alcoholics recovery and am wondering what you guys think about whether this is an OK habit. My biggest fear is that I'm enjoying the nicotine that Im absorbing through my mouth and not just the puffing motion that I'm sure many of you out there miss same as me. Please let me know what you think.

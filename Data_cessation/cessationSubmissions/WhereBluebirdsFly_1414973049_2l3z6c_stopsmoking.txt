41 Days - Ran a Half-Marathon

Today, on my 41st day of no smoking, I ran a half marathon in 2:05.02. When I smoked, my half marathon time was 2:16:48.  Not to mention the hacking cough during and after races and lethargy during my training.  Now, I can't wait to run.   

None of us are able to battle our addiction unless we replace it with something positive and goal driven.  For me, it's endurance racing and my career.  What's yours?

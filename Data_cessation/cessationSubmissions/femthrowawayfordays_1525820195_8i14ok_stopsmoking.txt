Denied free patches - today is a struggle

Hi friends.

One month is here! So off I went down to my local pharmacy to get my second month of free patches. It's a little government scheme we have in Canada.

And they denied me. Because I picked up the patches back in late Jan, but didn't start using them until early April, it's no a consecutive month. Therefore, I am no longer eligible for patches.

Like many smokers, I am low income. I spent ~$60 a month on rolling tobacco, and that was my habit. How much are patches you ask? $30 a week.

I simply can't afford it. And I'm spitting mad. Madder than I've been since I stopped smoking. All I want is that release of old, that quick fix and relaxation. Nicotine withdrawl is now compounding that issue.

Just venting. I'm not going to smoke. But this is going to be a very hard day.

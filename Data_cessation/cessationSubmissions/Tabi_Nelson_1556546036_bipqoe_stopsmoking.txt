Surviving

I've made it through my first week being smoke free. Two things that have helped have been; 
1) telling everyone I meet I've been smoke free for ** days. Makes me accountable, especially if I start again. 
2) sounds weird, but I have smelled ashtrays to smell the nastiness. I also have a jar of cig butts in water that smells nasty. This especially helps when I'm around people smoking. 

No nicotine replacement. Lots of journalling, crocheting, pool therapy, and trying to ride a bike (I have a severe back injury). 

I'm proud of myself, and of all of you on here for being quitters!

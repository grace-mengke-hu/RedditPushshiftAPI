5 days without a cigarette...I don't feel like I need a cigarette anymore...but will I ever stop wanting one?

I am currently on day five of not smoking. I'm proud of myself and the cravings have significantly lessened to the point where I don't feel this crazy urge to smoke every time I finish a meal or go outside. Although I feel like I don't need cigarettes to satisfy cravings, I still miss the habit. I miss the breaks in the day they gave me, the relaxation, e.t.c. Has anyone who quit smoking stopped wanting to smoke/stopped missing the habit?

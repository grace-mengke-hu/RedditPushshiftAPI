Alcohol triggers me

I can quit smoking and I did many times for 10+ days but then friends call me to drink and alcohol is my biggest and probably only trigger and I start smoking again. I can drink coffee without cigarettes and do anything without them but when I start drinking I can't control myself. Also I can't imagine myself 10+ days without drinking beer especially in hot summer days. I don't want to give up on beer (im not alcoholic) just to quit smoking. Do you have any advices for me?

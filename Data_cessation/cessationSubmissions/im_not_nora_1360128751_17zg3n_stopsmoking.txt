I just smoked my last cigarette. 

I started smoking when I was 14. My mother has smoked since she was eight (that is neither a joke nor a typo), and I grew up hearing "Don't smoke. Don't ever smoke." as she puffed away.  In 16 years of smoking, she has never found out. 

For over a month, I've had the Chantix ready. But I couldn't seem to get started, no matter how much I wanted to. I live with my smoking boyfriend, who says he wants to quit, but honestly, I think we were both afraid. 

Then I found this subreddit, and one of you kind souls (I don't remember who, and I'm sorry) posted a link to the easy way to quit smoking. 

I can't speak for my boyfriend, but I'm not scared anymore. Tomorrow is day eight on Chantix, and I'm ready. I have hated every cigarette these last four days, so much so that I cut down from 20 a day to five without trying. 

I can do this. I've made an account so that you can all hold me accountable. :) I quit for almost four years, and I won't fall for the trap a second time.  

Now if I can just get my honey to read the book, we can climb stairs without gasping and not get cancer together.

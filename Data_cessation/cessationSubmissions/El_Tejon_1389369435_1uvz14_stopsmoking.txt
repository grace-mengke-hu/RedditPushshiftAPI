Anyone on here use Wellbutrin to stop smoking? Advice!

I've been taking Wellbutrin for about a week and although it has so far helped curbing the desire to not smoke, my head is super foggy and I feel like I just got off those spinning carnival rides. I can't handle that feeling! Has anyone on here used it? Did you get dizzy? If so how long did it last? Thinking about just sucking it up and going cold turkey.

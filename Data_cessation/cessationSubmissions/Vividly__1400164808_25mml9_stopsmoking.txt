It feels impossible for me.

I've tried patches, electronic cigarettes, reading books suggested to me from this subreddit, going cold turkey, cutting back, and exercising. I don't know what more to do. It's great that I can run up the stairs without getting winded anymore, but I'm smoking more than ever now. I used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day and now I've doubled that and sometimes even more. I feel pathetic. I try to fight the urge but it's impossible. What more is there left to try?

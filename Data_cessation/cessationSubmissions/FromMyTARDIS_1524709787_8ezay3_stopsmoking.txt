It's all I can think about.

I really can't smoke, and don't want to. But my brain is begging for a smoke. It's been at about this level for 10 days, not as bad as it was at first but just doesn't seem like it's getting any easier. I do ok at work but when I get home It just doesn't stop. But now that I think about it I'm not nearly as sad or depressed as I have been that's good. Just sorta Using this sub to distract myself and wondering any other 20+ year chain smokers giving it up and how's it going for ya?

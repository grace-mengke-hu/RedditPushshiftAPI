What were some of the personal benefits you started seeing after quitting?

As my flair would suggest, I'm only about a week and a half in (Well I quit cigarettes over a month ago, but I was smoking hookah very regularly after), so I haven't noticed much but I think one thing I've noticed was that my sense of smell is more "articulate", if that makes sense. Certain smells are triggering memories more often, which is pretty cool.

One plus I'm hoping for is the ability to sleep in to come back to me. I wake up way too early and can't get back to sleep.

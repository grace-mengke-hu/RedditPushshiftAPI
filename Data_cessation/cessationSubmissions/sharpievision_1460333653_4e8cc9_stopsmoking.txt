6 Tips for Quitting Smoking, Coming From a Quitter Who Has Failed Many Times

Tell everyone you know the minute you decide to quit. They will not only be your support system, whether you think they will or not, but in the back of your mind you will think twice about having the disappointing and embarrassing news that you have not succeeded when they inevitably ask you how your quit is going.

Start walking. Notice how much easier just the simple act of walking is, how much further you're able to go, how much easier it is to breathe, how your legs don't feel like 200 lb weights after 3 miles. You'll notice a difference even after just a few days. Walking also will change your association of being outside with smoking.

Leave yourself notes. Inspirational or degrading, anything you think will help you. You know you best. A note might say “be proud to be a non smoker!” Or “don't smoke the next one you useless fuck.” Either way, it can help.

When you have a craving look at how many hours you've made without caving. It will make you reevaluate whether or not you want to throw all of those hours and incidents of resisting temptation. The more hours you have, the less you want to throw them all away.

Don't buy cigarettes. Tell yourself and your significant other to not let you buy cigarettes. Even if this means only taking enough cash with you to purchase exactly the things you needed and nothing else. Don't have the money available to spend on cigarettes. Temptation is out of your hands if you simply do not have the funds.

Don't dwell on what you think you're missing out on or depriving yourself of. Think of what a champion you are to be able to quit something that so many people struggle with. Every minute that goes by, you have proven you are stronger than everyone else who continues to smoke.

Here we go again...

Hi guys.  I've been trying to get myself back on the lozenges (4mg, mint, generic walmart variety) the last couple of days after flaming out going cold turkey on the weekend.  Without a solid 24 hours of success so far.  I went through the same pop a lozenge, want a cigarette, spit out a lozenge, smoke a cigarette, feel like shit, feel like a moron, repeat scenario again today up until about 1pm.  My work is very active and coming in without smoking in the morning then smoking mid-day?  Hooolieee-shit does that just take the wind out of you!

Anyway, its flippin' ridiculous what I'm doing to myself.  Like I was saying, came home, had a couple cigrarettes...

...have you ever noticed how sickly disgusting your beard smells, your fingers? It's like month-old in August death.  Bleeeaaugh.

...and took a shower and brushed my teeth to clear as much of it off as I could.  I know what my mouth is going to taste like in the morning. :P  I popped a lozenge and I intend to stick with the lozenge if it kills me.  Talk to you guys on Friday with my shiny new 1 day badge!

Doin pretty good with e-cig

Hi friends, I've been smoking for about 6 years, on and off half a pack a day. I just got an e-cig 3 days ago, and I love it. Since I've gotten it, I've smoked very few cigs. A few nights ago was even an all night drinking event, and I only smoked 1 cig (usually I would have smoked a TON).

 I spent about $60 for a decent one online. The cheap gas stations I had gotten before never did the trick for me. I'm ok still having nicotine for a bit, I'll begin to ween off of it. In the meantime, my lungs feel more clear, and I don't feel that cig induced malaise.  If anybody is thinking about using e-cigs to quit cigs, I'd recommend giving it a serious look!

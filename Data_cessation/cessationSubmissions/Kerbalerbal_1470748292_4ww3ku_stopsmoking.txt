Killing it!

Just thouhgt I'd check in, as this community does wonders for my psyche. 
I'm feeling so positive about quitting. Don't get me wrong it ain't easy but I feel that motivated. I keep telling myself if you can quit this then you can do anything. I've set goals and I'm using an app, along with you guys, I'm all over it. I got rear ended by a car today, my manic boss screamed at me and my partner had a panic attack. And I'm like you know what, I don't give a shit I've kicked this habit and getting upset or caving isn't going to fix anything (though a beer helps ðŸ˜‰).
So I guess what I'm saying is stay strong and feel good about yourself because you got this.
P.s. post-hardcore helps alot \m/

First new year as a nonsmoker!

This year I can say "stopping smoking" isn't a resolution as I left the things behind months ago! 

I don't miss them. But realize this sub is about to get blown up in the next few weeks or months. And so...

First, you can only do it if you really want to. Wait, that's a lie. I wanted to do it all of my adult life and failed over and over. What worked for me was a vape mod that actually delivered (controversial around these parts, I know) and I never looked back. But I can control how much I vape and know exactly how much I'm taking in as I work my way down, something I never was able to do with cigarettes.

Good luck fellow human reading this on New Year's Day because you are hopelessly addicted to cigarettes and looking for an out. I know how hard it is, and everything failed me until I started vaping. 

Opinions may be mixed, but just letting go of the sticks for an alternative that works can empower you in ways you don't know. All I know is I'm starting the year as a nonsmoker, which is something I never thought I'd be able to say.

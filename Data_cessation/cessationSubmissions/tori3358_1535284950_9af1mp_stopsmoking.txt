23yo F looking at ways to finally quit for good!

Hi guys, first time posting here. I am looking for ways to quit smoking, I started when I was 16 as a social thing, tried to be cool and here I am after many failed attempts trying to quit for good. My grandfather died from lung cancer almost two years ago after smoking his entire life and it really started putting things into perspective. I have tried patches and they made me nauseous and itchy and cold turkey wasn’t a good option either. I find that it is mostly routine that screws me up and am looking for tips on how to finally quit for good.

TLDR; have been smoking for 7 years- looking for tips to quit that aren’t going to make me crazy

Got a weird one! Any ladies find their periods delayed after quitting?

I quit smoking 3 weeks ago. My period is now late. I've taken multiple negative pregnancy tests, so I'm not too worried. That said, I looked around on google, and there really is no definitive science on the subject. So, I was wondering if anyone had any menstrual changes happen when they quit smoking. Thanks!

About to try to quit smoking

I’ve been a smoker for about 8 years. I’m 26 and started my senior year of high school out of stress. I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years with a guy that has wanted me to quit our entire relationship. I told him I’d try to quit 4 years ago, but made every excuse to push it off. I smoke to help my anxiety, but now I’m on meds for it and need to quit smoking. Any advice? The longest I’ve ever quit for was one week and it was because i had oral surgery. 

Is cold turkey the best? Or smoking aids?

Personified Craving

 I just wanted to share my interpretation of my most recent experience with quitting tobacco.

 The way that the craving communicates to me is like an angry human being who feels betrayed. I've learned to detach myself from it and just watch, which is quite difficult sometimes.

 If it had an audible voice, it would be most like Joe Pesci. When the first wave of cravings come, he's like, "Alright, alright. It's time for another dose. It's been a few hours.. whadda ya waiting for?" 

 And then as one continues deeper into the quit, perhaps on the second and third days, he gets annoyed, "Hey, we really need some nicotine here... Do you really think you can quit? Stop playin' around and light one up."

 When it realizes you're really quitting by the 4th and 5th days, then it becomes infuriated, cursing and screaming in the form of negative thoughts and powerful waves of irritable scatterbrained-ness, "You think you can just quit?! Huh??! I made you!! See how far you get without me, you muddafucka, you!!"

 And eventually he gets tired and quiets down, but he comes back several more times and alcohol brings him back every single time.
 I hope this analogy helps someone. 
 Cheers.

Just found this sub, 4 days in, but I'm noticing something...

Up until recently, I'd been a pack a day smoker for 5 years (started at 17, I'm 22 now). I made the decision to quit a few days ago, and with the help of my vaporizer, I've made it 4 days, with the conviction never to light up again.

My problem is that I notice myself becoming irritated more easily now. And I'm not normally like that. I guess what I'm asking is will these irritated episodes stop after a while? And what am I in for, in regards to general withdrawal symptoms?

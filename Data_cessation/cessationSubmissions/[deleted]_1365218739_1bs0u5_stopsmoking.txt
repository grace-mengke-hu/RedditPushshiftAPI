I love this sub. A drunken encouragement to all you you there.


I've just come home from a serious drinking binge, which lastet for about 8 hours. Didn't crave a cigarette. I'm still drunk, and I can't sleep because I'm so drunk and I'm afraid to puke in my bed,  so I figured I could contribute something to this awesome sub. You guys helped me a lot. 23/M/smoked for 8 years.


To all the recent quitters: 

You can do this. Seriously, I thought I couldn't do it when i quit on new year's eve, but it worked.

To everyone who wants to quit: 

I'm not going to lie, the first five days were hell for me. Didn't want to see anybody. Stomach aches.  I ate at least 10 whole toothpicks in the process. But keep on going, you'll feel amazing, trust me. You can finally breathe. 

* You know this feeling when you feel like suffocating and you can't breathe? Fucking gone. I hated that.

* Anxiety? Gone, you forget about cigarettes.

* Want to smoke after a meal? FUCKING GONE!

* Want to go up 15 stairs and not die? NO PROBLEM!

* Stomach shit problems fucking gone.

* All the fucking money, all of it. Take it. 


And contributing to this sub as a QUITTER feels so awesome. I'm almost crying right now, because this is the first time can tell other people how fucking awesome this is. Fuck these fucking cigarettes. Fucking fuckshit. You don't need this.

I know you think: "Just another dude on this sub telling me it feels good to quit, I should just unsubscirbe and keep on smoking." That's exactly what I thought, too.

But fuck it, just quit this shit already. It's time. You've smoked for too long. Think about your future children, your wife/husband. Your health. The'll need you. 

Goodbye.

I'd like to share the way I quit smoking.

I was a smoker for nearly 2 years before i quit. One day whilst driving to work I needed a pack, and being the poor college student I am and in the process of quitting smoking, I didn't have much to spend on the smokes I normally get. I was thinking maybe i can get a Black & Mild as a cheap way to tithe me over for my shift and i would smoke less if I didn't have a pack. While i was browsing the shop i saw a very cheap, soft pack of cigar/cigarettes that were Santa Fe brand. They were disgusting, but its all I had. It burned every time I inhaled and tasted absolutely horrible. Each time i smoked one, i had less and less of one every time. And the times i smoked started getting more spaced out as the pack dwindled. Basically I punished myself if i wanted to smoke by smoking those things. After drawing out the pack for nearly 2 weeks (which is a record for me), i threw out the remaining 6. It has been 2 weeks since then and I haven't touched a cigarette yet.

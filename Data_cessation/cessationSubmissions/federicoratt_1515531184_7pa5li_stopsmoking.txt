Still trying and failing...

Here I am once again trying to quit after 15+ years and I just can't get past through the first few days without the addiction defeating me. 
It's pretty frustrating. I'd be happy with at least reducing the amount of cigs without felling like shit and distracted because of the intense cravings. I've installed the Smoke Free app on iOS once again and am thinking I should buy the pro version this time. Is it worth it?
Failed countless times to be consistent by now.

Had A Drag The Other Day

Not going to reset my badge because, frankly, I don't feel like I should. Anyway, I'm moving across the country this week and likely won't ever see most of my friends again. Saw a friend the other day, we used to party real hard together (blow, M, Lucy, the lot) most every weekend but then he went to rehab and I snapped out of it but we both kept smoking (I've smoked for 8 years, I'm 23). 


I've quit a couple times before for little spurts (I've only smoked for 2 of the last 7 months - quit for 3, smoked for 2, quit for another 2 now - but I always felt like I was missing something). Well I went to see him the other day and we were hanging out and I had a drag off one of his cigs and it was probably the most disgusting thing I've ever experienced. The whole drive home all I could smell was the smoke on my hands, I hated it! (Which felt good) But damn, no wonder I had a harder time with girls, I can only imagine what I must have smelt like before.


Anywho I think I'm making progress on this - back in the gym, off the cigs, on a 3 week break currently from weed as well since I've been staying with my dad until I move.


Change is scary at first but it feels so good and really is for the better!

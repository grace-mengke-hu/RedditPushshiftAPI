Think I'm doing Easyway wrong

I started cutting back on Sunday to about a third my usual intake.  I've also started reading Easyway but as I'm getting further in he keeps reinforcing the idea of following it properly and not trying to quit etc until finished. I've got to the section on cutting down and worried I'm doing it wrong. Should I go back to smoking normally and restart the book or keep to my cut down level while I keep going?

69 Days.....

HAHAHAHAHA I'M FREEE!!!!!!! just wanted to celebrate a day that i think is more important than 1-2 months, it's day 69! Keep it up you guys, Fuck that nicotine monster, you can get it on without it. Do your thang, and live life without addiction(FREEEDOOOMM!!*lifts kilt and moons*) If you feel down on yourself on the way just remember, addicts aren't terrible people. Horses(and cigarettes) are terrible people. Much love.

Quitting Smoking During Strife?

Boyfriend dumped me to bang chicks 10 years younger (gross), I’m a doctoral student with 2 years before the end of my degree, I have no money, and I am moving house — life is a mess right now. However, I feel like since my life is upended,  I should stop smoking too?  Yeah? Why the hell not? 

Anyone quit when your emotions are already jacked? Haven’t smoked in a day and I feel hecka emotional. Not sure if it is the actual emotions or the lack of cigs...or both? 

The changing of my routine seems like a good time get these cigs out of my life.

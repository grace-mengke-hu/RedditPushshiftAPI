The very last one-send motivational messages for the morning!

I just lit my very last cigarette. My fianc√© quit five days ago tomorrow. We live with four other smokers. He's doing amazing and makes it look so easy.

I know it won't be as easy for me. It will be hell but it's the hell I made for myself and it's time to claw my way out. 

With that I am going to set up my quiting app I've seen on here and go to bed. If anyone feels so inclined I would very much love and appreciate some nice things, motivational messages, or reminders on why I'm doing this to read through in the morning when I'm struggling hard. 

You're all awesome! Have a great night and here's to the rest of our lives!

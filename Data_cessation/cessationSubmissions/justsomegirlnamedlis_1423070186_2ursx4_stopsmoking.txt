Today I might fail

Today sucks and I am having a very hard time not smoking.  I was not expecting how big all my feelings would feel once I quit and quite frankly,  they feel too big and ugly to deal with. I had an argument with my husband and have to take my child to a cardiologist today which is scaring me to death, and all I want is one cigarette.  Just one. I am telling myself to hold on for a few minutes and trying to ride it out.
Feeling feelings is hard without smoking.

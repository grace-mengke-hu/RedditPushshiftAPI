Honestly never realized how much I reeked of cigarette smoke until these past couple of weeks.

I use public transportation to get to and from work. The route I take has a 15 minute layover at a transit station to change buses. A lot of people take that 15 minutes to go outside and smoke (I used to be one of them). Now when I get on the next bus I can totally smell the cigarette smoke on the other riders, and, well, it stinks. Really reeks. It was then I realized that that's the way I stunk for years and just never thought it was that bad. Now I know, it was that bad. I apologized to my friends and family. :-(

Edit: a word

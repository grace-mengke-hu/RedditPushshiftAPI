So much more time and money

Maybe I m writing this for myself but.. I have so much money! It’s incredible how much stuff I can buy now, and I m not even a month smoke free. For the ones struggling... if you quit, you will realize how much time and money you have! Along with your health, it’s so worth to quit! Everyone can do it!

Anyone experiencing semi-anhedonia while quitting? Going on day 5.

anhedonia: inability to feel pleasure.
if so, what do you do to deal with it?  I'm vaping and getting nicotine, so it seems I should not feel this way.  I don't understand why.  The other chemicals in cigarettes should not be so strong that my mood should be this drastically changed while still vaping nicotine.  I'm already on a higher dose of cymbalta for depression and fibromyalgia.  I just feel not very interested in things or happy.  Sometimes, I get random extreme emotions like rage, hyperness, sadness.  Any idea what's going on guys?

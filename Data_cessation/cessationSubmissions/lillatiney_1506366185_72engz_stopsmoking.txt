Third day

Hello everyone on this wonderful sub.
I found this reddit today as I searched for motivation as today was a really hard day for me. 
I quit the night to saturday as I didn't have any more cigarettes at the time (had been out partying, and I don't have any cravings for cigarettes or nicotine when I'm hungover). And the fact that during the last months have thought the cigarette taste is absolutely horrible.

I feel like it's inevitable that I screw up, sooner rather than later and therefor I feel like it would just be easier to continue to smoke. I don't crave cigarettes as I think it taste horrible, but I crave the feeling the cigarettes give me.

Have been smoking for around 8 years (was smokefree for 8 months a few years ago)

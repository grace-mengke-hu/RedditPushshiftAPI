Stopping. Right now.

Hello! It's been a decade since I started smoking, and today is the day I stop. Had my last one about half an hour ago, so I'm not exactly struggling here, but I'm posting this to cement my decision, and it'd be nice to have some moral support...

How are you all today? Enjoying being ex-smokers?

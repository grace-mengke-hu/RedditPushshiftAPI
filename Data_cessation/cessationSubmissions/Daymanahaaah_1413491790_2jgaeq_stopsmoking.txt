Afraid to quit

I've been smoking for 10 years, I know people who have quit, and now they can't be around it, it either annoys them to death, or they feel tempted, or they sit a nag me. I don't want to become preachy when I quit. This isn't the only thing stopping me. I also reeeaaaally like smoking. Any advice and encouragement is helpful. I keep telling myself  "one day, just not today."

Edit: Thanks for the great feedback and constructive comments. I appreciate you guys.

Will this problem become normal again if i stop smoking ? And how many days would it take ?

I have been a cigarette smoker for 3 and a half years and i have noticed my penis has shrinked a little bit and my grith is nowhere even close as it was before. I never smoked more than 5 per day but it has been 3 long years of being a smoker and i thought that warning was bullocks. I am regretting this now just want to know from the quitters have they felt any difference after quitting ?

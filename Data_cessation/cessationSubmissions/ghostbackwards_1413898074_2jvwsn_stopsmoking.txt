I'm currently sitting in a hospital waiting room as my mother is getting a biopsy.

I'm noticing how many people coming into this cancer wing just reek of cigarettes. So many sick looking people. Fuck cigarettes. 

Obviously not every person who has cancer is because of smoking or vice versa. It's just what is in my face right now.

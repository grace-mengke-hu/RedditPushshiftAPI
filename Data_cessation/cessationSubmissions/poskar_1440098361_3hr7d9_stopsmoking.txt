Holy fuck. Seems like quitting was overdue.

So, I am a 25 year old asthmatic who has been smoking more or less a pack a day the last 5-6 years. I tried to quit twice before, but didn't follow through. After actively ignoring the misery the cigarettes put me in for way too long two weeks ago it clicked somehow. For some reason I am just done with that shit.

And here comes the "success" I experienced today. I coughed up black phlegm. Not grey-sort-of-unhealthy-looking phlegm, black as motherfucking tar - of course that's because what it is - phlegm straight out of hell. I'll take that as a good sign. Obviously the awakening of the kinocilia is happening!

Just wanted to tell everybody to stay strong! Every single day counts.

Allen Carr's book-most boring read ever?

I am following the instructions, I want this book to do the trick.  I want to quit smoking.  However....this is torturous.  It is horribly written, it is so repetitive and ridiculously boring!  How did all of you get through this?!  I'm still powering through but I'm not sure how much longer I can take this!

I start tomorrow!

   I have been a smoker for only 7 years so I have decided that enough is enough and I have to kick the "habit" before I get any older and lose out on the fun things later life could hold. 

  I've been planing to quit for a month now and sat my quit date for tomorrow as well as setting up a goal for myself (I want to get into part-time streaming on Twitch as a hobby, so I'll be using the ~$4500 to get that started!) and I decided to seek out communities where I can find support when I stumbled across this place.

Any way, I'm just wondering if anyone here has any non-conventional advice they think I may not have seen already or just any tips in general.

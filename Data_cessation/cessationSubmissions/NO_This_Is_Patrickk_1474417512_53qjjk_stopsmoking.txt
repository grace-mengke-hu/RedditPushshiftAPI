Tomorrow is the big day!

After various short, long, and failed attempts to quit smoking tomorrow is my next attempt. Hopefully my final attempt. After nearly 6 years of feeling terrible, sneaking off for smokes away from non-smokers, and a general low self-worth I have high hopes that tomorrow may be the day I am finally free of this burden. 

Some background information: I grew up in a household of smoking. My mother smoked 3 packs a day in the house. It wasn't until I was about 17 that I first started smoking and it wasn't too long after that when I realized I was hooked. I first attempted quitting about a year or two after I started smoking when my mother passed away from lung cancer. That attempt was obviously unsuccessful and there were plenty of failed attempts after that. A year and 2 days ago I was blessed with the birth of my daughter. Before she was born I had been smoke free for quite a few months but unfortunately stress got the best of me. I understand that stress was not the true issue but the addiction was what really got me hooked again. 

I have taken the normal steps, reading the easyway, downloading a stop smoking app, I've had this quit date for the past month and am generally ready to be done with it. The biggest difference is finding this subreddit. I really feel like this could help out exponentially. Until now the community I have had, family members and friends, all have been smokers. Although they are still my friends and family, I could benefit greatly having this as an extra support group.

Wish me good luck and I hope you all are successful in your attempts.

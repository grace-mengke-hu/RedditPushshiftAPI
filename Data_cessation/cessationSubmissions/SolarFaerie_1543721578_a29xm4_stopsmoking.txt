How much does a few hits of a cig set me back health-wise?

I had a terrible day and ended up lighting up about an hour ago... took three hits before and put it out. It was disgusting. My fancy mint honeydew kiwi vape is a million times better. I've felt my health improve so much in just a few days, but now I feel kinda shitty from the cig. I was a pack a day for years and this was just 3 hits, but I feel like I messed up the progress I made.

On another note.. how can I possibly spend all day craving a smoke, I literally cried it was so bad on top of all the stress, I spent all day thinking about it and the hour between deciding to smoke and actually smoking was the most peaceful I've felt in days... and then hate smoking? I can't believe what I did to myself... I finally understand why you have to be 18 to buy smokes... dumbass 12 year old me decided it would be cool and then my entire teenage years revolved around cigarettes. I feel like I had no choice in the matter, yet I did everything in my power to continue smoking. This mental disconnect is unreal.

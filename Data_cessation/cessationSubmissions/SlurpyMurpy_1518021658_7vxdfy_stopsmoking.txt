First day a non-smoker

after about 3 months of wanting to quit and trying and failing over and over and over, finally just decided to quit. Was always worried about how hard it would be but now I welcome the difficulty. Bring it on, pain and suffering. I need a good challenge here lately, life’s just too easy. 

I’ll be writing about the journey here and how I overcome my obstacles. Looking forward to finally kicking the little demons ass.

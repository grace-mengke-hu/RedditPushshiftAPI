Nobody thinks I can do this...

I'm the butt of the joke (no pun). All my friends tell me that I'll never be able to quit. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of smoking making me sick, draining money from my bank account, and making all my clothes stink. I'm running out of time, I've been smoking for almost ten years. I know I'm not invincible. These things are going to kill me.

Fuck this, I'm done. My throat hurts.

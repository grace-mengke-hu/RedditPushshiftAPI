Quit yesterday - how do I fill my breaks?

Hi Guys,

I decided to quit a couple of weeks ago and yesterday was the day. I used to smoke a pack a day (24-26 in one in germany atm).
Today I have been spending a lot of time cleaning the apartment and doing some research for presentations and papers that are due the next couple of weeks.

My problem is, that I used to "reward" myself with a smoke after completing a task or doing some work for an hour or so and the few minutes after completing a task today were really hard. I was pacing around my flat, not knowing what to do...

How do you fill these little breaks you took throughout the day now that you quit? BTW also watched Allen Carrs Video thing, the reminding myself that I don't need it and I'm killing the nicotine monster wasn't really helping..

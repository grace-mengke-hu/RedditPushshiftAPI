9 days of no smoking

Hey everyone ! First time poster, pretty long time lurker.

So I'm a 20 year old guy that just finished his second year of college and swore to quit after the exam session. So far so good.

I started smoking in college, so it's been almost 2 years with regulary 10-12 cigarettes a day and way over a pack when there was a party or when it was exam day ( I could smoke a pack in like 8 hours around the exam, like 4 before 4 after ). 
I wanted to quit several times, but there was always something in the way : a party, friends smoking like dragons around me ( lol ), stress from exams ( toughest university in the country ) etc.

The problem is : I'm in a pretty good place right now. I'm drinking tons of water, exercising, eating healthy and I do not feel the need to smoke. BUT once I will get back to the city where I go to college I am afraid all the old habits will just come back. Like I still can't imagine going to a party and not smoking while drinking or in the course breaks not going out for a quick smoke because for the past 2 years that's the way it's been and I don't know it any other way. 
If you have any tips on how to overcome this, feel free to share.

Sorry for the long post !

TL;DR : Quit smoking for 9 days after 2 years of smoking in college, afraid I'll go back to it once I go to a party/go to college/go out with friends in the city where my college is.

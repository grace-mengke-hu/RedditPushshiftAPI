I am going to document my journey of quitting cigarettes.

Well, I have been smoking since 7th grade, started with one day a day and now I am up to a pack plus a day :(. It's wrecking my life physically and financially and every time I try to stop I come back, and that bothers me mentally, a LOT. So, I really enjoy writing and talking about my problems to get it out of my head, so to help me stop I am going to update this thread daily with how I feel and how much I am saving. It's ok if you guys do not follow, but I am going to use this thread to help me have a place to talk about it, I feel it will help a lot. I will finish this pack tomorrow and will not be buying more! For those who do wish to follow my progress, should I update with thread edits or comments? Feel free to save the thread, and see how far I come along!

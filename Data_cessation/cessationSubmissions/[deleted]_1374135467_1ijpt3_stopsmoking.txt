Tips and anyone know the tar and nicotine levels of...? (canadian brands)

Hey everyone, quitting/cutting back leading up to my first year of full time university in hopes to cut out a lot of unnecessary spending and I'll be starting a job that has very little time for smoke breaks and requires a lot of cardio endurance. So any tips and advice for a 5 year smoker (half a pack a day)? 

Also anyone off hand know the nicotine and tar levels for Belmonts and Pall mall bolds? I've noticed they no longer print the information on the packages and I've tried googling them to no avail. The reason I ask is that since I knew I was going to be quitting I switched brands and have since went from 3-4 packs a week to less then 2, but want to know if I just shot myself in the foot with a higher level cig?

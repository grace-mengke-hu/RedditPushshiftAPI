three months in, having a hard time again

i can't believe i have day 100 coming up! i should celebrate on the weekend :)  


i'm having strong cravings again though. it seems for me it's really bad after three days, then after three weeks, now after three months. but this week is already getting better again, and i'm sure i can get back to my healthy not-thinking-about-it from a few weeks ago. then, it might even last me to three years! i just need to remember to come back here before smoking. just lurking around with you guys helps so much that in the end i never make the mistake. thank you!

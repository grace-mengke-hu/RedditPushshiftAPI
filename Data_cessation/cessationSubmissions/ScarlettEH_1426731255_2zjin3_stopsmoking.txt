It gets better...WAY better

I'm a long time lurker on here.  You all have inspired me and kept me going.  I'm officially 114 days quit.  So now, I feel like I should give back a little.

Last night I went running with my partner and our friend.  This was the first time I ran since highschool (I'm 30 now) and I have been smoking since age 12.  I had been nervous about slowing down the guys and I was loathing this little experiment.  I never run.  Unless there's an ice cream truck to chase.  

But guys, I ran.  I ran hard and I ran fast.  I didn't stop and I had a stupid grin on my face the whole time.  The moment where I'd cough, start wheezing, or just puke never came.  When we reached the end of our run, I started to cry.  I *never* thought I would run like that, let alone enjoy it.  I enjoyed it so much that I ran again tonight.  

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, stay quit.  Stay healthy.  And a whole other world can open up.

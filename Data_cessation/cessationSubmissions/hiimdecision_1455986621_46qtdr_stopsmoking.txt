Day 365: how to do it.

Today I mark my 365th day of not smoking. No replacements, no weening, no substitutes - cold turkey. 

Coming up to this date I thought of all the things I could write as encouragement to my fellow quitters. Some of them were poetic, some were creative, and some where just plain stupid. In the end I realized it doesn't matter what anyone says or what advice they give, you will only truly quit when you are ready to quit.

So, the best advice I can give is just worry about today. Don't worry about tomorrow or how hard it will be next week, or next time you go drink. Worry about today. Today you will NOT be a smoker. You might relapse tomorrow - hell I might, however; that's not important. Today you will not be a smoker and I think that's good enough for me. One less day not engulfed in addiction.

So how did I get to day 365? It's simple, just don't start smoking. After all, everyone's already an ex smoker the second they finish a cigarette. It's not about quitting, it's about never starting again.

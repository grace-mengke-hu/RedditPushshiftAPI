Almost 6 days into quitting and struggling not to overeat when cigarette cravings hit

I started ww back in August. I’ve lost almost 50 lbs so far. Quitting naturally followed making healthier choices. Today I’m just so frustrated because it’s like I’m going through the beginning stages of it all over again and struggling to choose healthy options. Everyone told me I’d gain the weight back if I quit smoking. My doctor said that wasn’t exactly true. I know it’s not true in the sense that I *have* to gain it back. Any tips on not eating the house while I struggle with cigarette cravings?

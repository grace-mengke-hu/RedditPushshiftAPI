Last cigarette last night at 10PM

I am going to give this yet another try, I have been smoking for a good 5 years now and am turning 24 in May.  I've been getting sick on a rotation and I know for a fact its from the smoking.  Lately I have also been having a hard time to breathe, I feel like I'm out of breath at times....

This isn't my first time trying to quit I have gone for about 2 weeks before, but this time I'm going to break that record and for good.

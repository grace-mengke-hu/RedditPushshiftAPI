Is the notorious 3 day hump true?

Hi friends.  I've heard about getting over day 3-4 depending on the person, but I've found out that nicotine metabolites actually have left the body at the point, and then withdrawals begin.  I had quit for 3 days and thought I was over the worst of it, and then things got really bad as far as cravings go, so I looked this up.  Does anyone else have this experience?  If not, is it the 3 or 4 day hump that is the hardest for you?  I've heard it can take 2 to 3 weeks for smokers to end intense withdrawal symptoms, and about 3 months for the brain chemistry to normalize from lack nicotine (for those who are going nicotine free).
Y'all inspired me yesterday and I'm now just vaping.  Haven't smoked for 16 hours.  woohoo!  Tell me your thoughts and experiences about this 3-4 day hump versus the other stuff?  I'm really interested.  Also, what activities work for you when you really want to smoke?

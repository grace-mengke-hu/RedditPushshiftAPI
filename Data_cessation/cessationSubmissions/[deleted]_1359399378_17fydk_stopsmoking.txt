day 2, heads pounding

I went out on Saturday night with some friends. Did the usual "have a couple beers, duck out for a smoke" dance. Stuck my hand into the pack at one point and realized i was on my last cigarette. smoked it while looking at the 7-11 across the street, a new pack was close at hand. then... i don't know what happened. I just never went back out for a smoke. On Sunday, I didn't go buy a pack. By this morning I realized I was quitting. 

So now, officially on day 2, no butts. My heads pounding and the headache has recently moved into my teeth and jaw. It's a regular party of pain everywhere north of my adams apple.

How long until the headaches pass? Any ideas on ow to cope?

Craving by Association

One thing I noticed in the 13 days that I haven't had a tobacco product, is that I have to start shifting these millisecond associations. 

I have no more nicotine in my system, and no more psychological desire to smoke. But, as most of you know, certain activities trigger that quick reflex that nudges you like "eh, how bout a dart?" 

This isn't something that's frustrating for me or anything. It's just interesting to analyze it from a different perspective than on any of the other times I tried to quit. 

Now there's really no trying. It's almost like I'm looking in on someone else, and noticing these symptoms of being a smoker for so long. Your mind just totally adapts to this addiction. 

What do I do when I have these split second thoughts that a cig would be nice right now? Nothing, really. I acknowledge them, but they don't cause any physical pain or prolonged desire cause I know I'm on the best level you can be. 

 I'm actively not smoking and reaping the results every day. I feel them. I'm not depriving myself of anything. Smoking is what deprives you, but since it's viewed as this act, and non-smoking is viewed as a non-act, we feel that it provides something. It provides as much as a punch in the face. You feel like absolute bologna after. 

As I continue to acknowledge these psychological cravings, my brain starts recognizing that the cigarette isn't the crutch anymore, and I already feel stronger as a result of that.

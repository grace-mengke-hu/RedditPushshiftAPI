Former 10 mile a day runner turned 10 year smoker

I've had this habbit for nearly ten years now (currently 31 years old), and I'm polishing off about a pack every other day.  I can feel it's taking a toll on me now.  I can't run a mile without gasping for breath by the end (at a pace of about 6-7mins per mile).  It's especially saddening because I know how passionate I used to be about keeping healthy.  I still eat well, and I'm not fat-- but I feel like my lungs have aged an extra 50 years.  I have a horrible soda drinking habbit as well (hell, I can't remember the last time I had water).  Anyway, I need some serious advice.  I've tried nearly every brand of nicoderm (sp?) gum, hypnosis and seen virtually every YouTube video on the subject.

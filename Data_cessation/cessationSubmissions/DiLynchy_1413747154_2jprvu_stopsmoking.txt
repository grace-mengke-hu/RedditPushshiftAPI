I'm as unhealthy now trying to quit smoking because I'm replacing it with junk food and smoking still.

My family don't know I've relapsed, and I pretend to my dad that I walk to take my mind off smoking, but I'm actually smoking in the dark streets. It's depressing. I must have threw away almost full packets of cigarettes because I hate the idea of smoking. I don't want to get taught and disappoint my dad. He's proud of me. He thinks I've been smoke free for 19 days now. 

I need advice, or help. I don't want to do this any more. I want to be healthy and 'normal' again.

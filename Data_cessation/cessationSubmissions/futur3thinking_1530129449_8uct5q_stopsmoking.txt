July 1st quit date - any tips from the pros? Beforehand? During the first few days? Weeks?

I would consider myself a very casual smoker, however it has come time to put even that to an end. I can go the whole work week and not even think about smoking, but as soon as the weekend hits and I get that first beer in my hand I want nothing more than to light up and will at pretty much any cost. At this point I'm about a 10 per week smoker and most of you would think oh man that would be easy, I personally think it's harder because you're not constantly reminded of the fact that your trying to quit and most people I talk to say 'only 10 a week? what are you worried about!' Well, i'm worried about stage 1 COPD and heart desease. You'd think this WOULD be easy but I've found it next to impossible to break the chain. I have gum, patches, etc but I don't want to use those because it's still nicotine in my body and I do not want that. 

Booze will 100&amp;#37; = smoking, every time, without fail.

I've come up with a few things, mainly staying away from booze for a couple of weeks to help curb that type of craving, trying toothpicks when at the bar/out for drinks so that hand/mouth feeling is taken away and 3rd bringing a non-nicotine vape pen just incase. It all sounds easy enough but I've tried and caved many times over the past year and it's becomming really annoying

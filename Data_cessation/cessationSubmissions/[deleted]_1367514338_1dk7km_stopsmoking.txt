48 hours in and I feel like the storm has subsided a bit.

Last night was tough but today I feel my pride is stronger than my cravings. For any one else going through this, STAY STRONG! You can do it. It only gets better.          
Things that are helping:
Fizzy water, Sour licorice, ricola cough drops (Honey-Herb) and spicy things.

Willpower Vs. Easyway

I don't usually go for slogans or gimmicks but Allen Carr illuminated the difference between forcing yourself to quit and relishing quitting like I'd never heard before.  I wish I could impart this wisdom on my still smoking friends and family members but sadly it seems that only those people who seek to quit might (possibly) hear it.  One of the greatest ironies I can think of is that nicotine can make you think it's difficult to quit when it isn't, which in turn makes it difficult to quit.  When you get past the 'smoke and mirrors' though, it's just so... well, Easy.  

Thanks Allen

yay! star!

I posted a wall the other day, so I'll forgo that this time since it's only been 2 days. But I have a star now!

Today has definitely been trying, especially because we ran out of water at the office (and LA tap water is meh...) so I can't just pound water every time I get a craving.

Anywho. I never thought I'd make it to 30 days. Crazy.

Today I had my last cigarette hopefully.

I never knew cigarette addiction until I myself was addicted.  I think that's what a lot of people don't understand, you'll never understand why it's so hard to quit until your actually a smoker. That's why I'm glad I've joined this community for you guys know what it's like. I decided to go cold turkey today and I think I'm ready to finally quit smoking!

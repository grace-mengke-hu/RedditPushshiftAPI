1 week of quitting under my belt

I decided to quit around Valentine's Day. I usually never last longer than a couple of days. I've given away my favorite zippo, along with my other lighters, washed all of my clothes and I'm committed.

I'm supposed to go to a party tonight, which is usually a trigger for me, but I'm hoping that I can make it through without giving in.

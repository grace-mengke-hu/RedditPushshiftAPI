You have to be humble and stay humble

Cigarettes are so fucking addicting! You can't think "I'll just have this one or smoke this one day and be done". You have to go all in. I had a 796 day streak going and smoked last week. I've smoked most days since. Just be careful guys. Needed to vent, stay humble and realize cigarettes are bullshit.

thank you r/stopsmoking

I posted 2 weeks ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3azvjs/i_cant_quit/) wanting to quit but not knowing how. Turns out your advice got me off to a great start, I think what I needed was to know that the addiction tells me lies to get me to fall as many of you helpfully pointed out. Today is day 10 and I'm really enjoying not smoking other than my body adjusting to it. When a craving comes I recognize it, note it in my app, and recognize the lie that the addiction is telling me. For a very stubborn and independent person I never thought being part of a community would work for me but I'm glad you're here.

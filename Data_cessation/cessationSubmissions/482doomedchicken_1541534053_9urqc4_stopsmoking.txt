I feel so fucking unhealthy im quitting right now

My life would honestly be a 9/10 right now if it wasn't for my health, everything's going amazing, this is really how my younger self would want me to be living!! but I feel like I'm physically dying inside every day, every day I'm scared I'll get hospitalised again for my asthma or a thousand other things I'm paranoid about, and I KNOW if I stop smoking I will feel better. I'm not going to lie, I have a genuine love of smoking, but I'm deciding to love myself more. I hope this lasts

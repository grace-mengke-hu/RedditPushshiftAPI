6 months smoke free

What can I say? I can't believe i used to smoke a pack a day 6 months ago. Quitting smoking caused a domino effect in my life. It led to eating healthier, working out, and helped me realize that I am in control of my life. This subreddit, along with Allen Carrs book, helped me get through the hardest parts of my addiction. Thank you for the support. Here's to another 6 months as a non smoker.

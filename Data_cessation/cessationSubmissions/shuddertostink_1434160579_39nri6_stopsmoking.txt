It's Friday night, I've worked hard all week, I put in a great session at the gym and I want nothing more than to go to the neighborhood pub and have a really, really cold beer.

But I know where that would probably lead so here I am on a Friday night all pumped up looking to have fun and sitting on a fucking computer for fucks sake.   

I may go anyhow.

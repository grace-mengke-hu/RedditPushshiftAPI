After almost a year. I'm craving them more then ever.

Here I am after quitting smoking for almost a year (will be a year next week) after something for almost 6 years. I decided last year that i kind of wanted to quit smoking and I wasn't until I got super  sick and i couldn't smoke until I finally decided to take it as a headstart to quick smoking finally.I don't know if it's the fall the and the climate that comes with it that is causing this or just the stress that I'm dealing with lately. Usually I can kind of control it sober, or at least distract myself, but it's difficult when I'm just driving(usually when I smoked) or drinking. I just feel like I've come to far too go back to doing it, but then again I feel maybe it could make me deal with my stress better. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you overcome it?

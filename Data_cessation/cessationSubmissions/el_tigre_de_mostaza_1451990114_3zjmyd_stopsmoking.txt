1 Day down - quick question.

Hi Guys,

I decided as a new years resolution like a lot of people to stop smoking, and yesterday was the first time without a smoke in years. I'm using Niquitin patches program starting from Step 1. I have never been a heavy smoker, 10 a day (15 on a bad day). I've started on Step 1 of the Niquitin patches, however they're Â£10 per packet and each packet contains 7 patches. They recommend using the Step 1 patches for 6 weeks before moving on to Step 2, which I think is a bit extreme. I know it's very early days yet but I seem to be coping ok. So on to my question - do you think it would be OK to come move on to Step 2 of the patches 2/3 weeks early? It's not really a money issue, more a necessity issue - I just want to quit as soon as possible. Can anyone share any experiences they've had with Niquitin patches/similar?

TL;DR Want to quit sooner rather than later, thoughts on coming off Step 1 of Niquitin patches earlier than recommended.

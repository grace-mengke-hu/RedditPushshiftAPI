The 48 hour mark...

Alright so its been 48 hours since i quit and what a rollerocoaster it has been. Ive read almost three quarters of allen carrs book which turned me off ciggarettes in the first 24 hours, i had not one craving!. But then came day 2 and ive been a angry you know what today. I havent talked to anyone and when i have ive explode in anger. I really hope this passes soon enough so i can sort of get back in normal shape for christmas but i also had the chance to light one today but i didnt do it so thats a step in the right direction!

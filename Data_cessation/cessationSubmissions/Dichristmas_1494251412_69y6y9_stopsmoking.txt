2 weeks done

Well it's been 2 weeks, the longest I've gone without smoking for over half my life. (28 years). I did the patch for the first 3 days as well as the Nicorette gum, and now I'm onto just regular gum whenever I feel the craving. Still chewing lots of gum. My husband and I smoked a pack a day each for the last 28 years so this is not easy. He hasn't quit yet, but does not smoke in the house or the car now. He has cut down quite a bit. 
Just wanted to warn you about the nicorette gum, if you don't follow the instructions exactly, it does kill the throat. It only wants you to chew it once or twice, then put it in between your cheek and gums for a minute then chew once or twice and repeat. I had a hard time not chewing the gum and my throat was very sore and couldn't talk for a couple days.  
I try to stay busy, but find myself walking in circles a lot, wanting to go for a puff, but then realize I don't do that anymore. 
Wishing all others who are fighting this battle the best and praying you stay strong. 
It's sites like this that we can do this together and keep encouraging one another. 
I'll be posting on my one month. Can't wait.

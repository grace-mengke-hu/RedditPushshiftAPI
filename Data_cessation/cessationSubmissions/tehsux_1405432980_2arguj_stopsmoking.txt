New to this sub and see a lot of people are fans of Alan Carr's method - anything you would add or change?

A friend recommended Carr's book, I've read it and it opened my eyes - for the first time, I feel like I am ready to quit. However, I still have that nagging fear thinking about putting out my last cigarette. Any of you have any suggestions or thoughts about the method that helped you?

Talking, not smoking

So a lot of my coworkers are smokers. Since I quit, I've been highly unsocial, not because of cravings (mostly), but because I was afraid of the temptation. Today, I have been able to stop while they are smoking and joking and enjoy the conversation. I actually had to stand upwind for a bit, as the smell was not at all appealing. Yay progress!

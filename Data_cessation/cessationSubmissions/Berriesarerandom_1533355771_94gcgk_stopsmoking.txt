Food over cigarettes

Today marks 4 weeks since I’ve quit. I called my mom to tell her and she was ecstatic. Then she told me this story that I wished I heard years ago. She said when I was younger, we went through a couple months where she was living paycheck to paycheck. She got to the point where she only bought food that she could find on sale or that had coupons for and she would plan meals according to the coupons she had. Well one Saturday she was at the last store that had the sale on vegetables and her total was about $15. Right after she checked out she went over to the little counter that sold the cigarettes and she bought her three packs for the week. The cigarettes costed more than the food that she just bought. It was that moment that she realized that with that money, she could have bought another meal or two for us. And that’s when she decided to quit. 
This may not mean much to you but as a 23 year old who just moved out a couple months ago, and constantly hungry now because I gotta make sure I pay rent before I buy food, this really hit home. I’m so glad that I quit. And I hope that this story somehow helps you in your journey.

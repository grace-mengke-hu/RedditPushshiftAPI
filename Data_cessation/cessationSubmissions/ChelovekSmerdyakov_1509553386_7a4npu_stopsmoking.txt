I've been meaning to quit for soo long.

I've been meaning to quit since January 1st, and several times before that. I've never really been serious about it, though. it's funny because I'm a hiker and when I'm in the mountains I don't feel the urge to smoke. Not so much when I'm a walking through a city park, chain smoking. If only I could move to a mountain for a couple months...

I have three more cigarettes  and then it's on. Wish me luck!

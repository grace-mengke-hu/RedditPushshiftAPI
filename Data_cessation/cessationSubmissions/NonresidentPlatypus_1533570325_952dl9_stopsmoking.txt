Hour #9

Hello! I’m a 23 year old female. This is my first time posting on here so here we go. 
I posted on r/askreddit how to quit smoking cold turkey and they brought me over here. 
I have a *very* important surgery coming up and have to be nicotine free by the 14th of this month or they will not do the surgery, I’ve had a lot of comments saying “that’s not enough time.” Blah blah blah.

I’m doing this shit, I want to and have to quit smoking. 
One second is enough time to quit cigarettes and I’ll prove everyone that. 

I’m sure I’ll start crying and being emotional for a cig in about 10 minutes but it’ll pass, it has to.

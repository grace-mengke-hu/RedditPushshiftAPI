I just spent fifteen minutes on the floor, sobbing. And guess what?

I was trying to kill my cravings by eating yoghurt and browsing this sub at the same time, which resulted in me spilling yoghurt all over myself, the bed and my laptop.

I spent the next fifteen minutes on the floor, covered in goo, trying to get yoghurt and chia seeds out of the USB ports on my laptops. Trying to silence the voice in my head that kept telling me that a cigarette would make it all better. I cried and cried and cried. I wiped tears off my face with hands covered in yoghurt. I sobbed. I swore. I was generally a fucking mess. 

And guess what? It was still better than smoking a cigarette that would have set off a chain to ruin the remainder of my life. It was still less pathetic than what I've been doing for the past eight years; namely convincing myself that I am enjoying this poison and that I smoke because I *want* to. Nobody in their right mind would want to feel this way. 

The more I crave nicotine the more I hate the thought of smoking. I cannot wait to be free.

So, after I quit...

What course of action can I use to help my body ( a.) Rid my lungs of dead tissue. (B.) Repair lost tissue.  (C.) Overall heal myself of the damage I've done over the last 13 years.  I turn 30 in july and will be done with this by then.  But, I really think helping my body heal will help down the road.  (Holistic remedies welcome)

Been under a lot of stress lately...heartbroken...having rationalizations for smoking

My life right now is just pain...work and pain...I keep thinking about the pleasure of smoking...I know it won't make the problems go away...but at least I have those little moments of peace and pleasure. I used like smoking with a coffee in the morning...or at night looking at the sky...they are special moments...

But then I think about about how addictive it is, and that it made my skin gray, and how I used to spit phlegm and cough.

But what If I smoke less now? What if I only have 1 or 2 cigarettes a day? Is it possible to have 1 or 2 cigarettes a day? Of course not...I have tried. What ends up happening is that right after I finish my first cigarette I cannot stop thinking about the 2nd one. The 2nd cigarette becomes an obsession, It consumes my entire day...It drives me crazy...I've tried smoking 2 a day and its impossible for me, I will end up smoking 10 a day again...Do I want to smoke 10-12 cigarettes daily again? NO.

Sorry for this post...I just needed share what I am going through...have any of you had rationalizations for relapsing...and how do you deal with it? thanks for the help.

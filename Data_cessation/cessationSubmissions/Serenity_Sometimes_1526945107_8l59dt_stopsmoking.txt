Cravings going into day 10

It will be 10 days smoke free in 1.25 hrs 😁.  The awful cravings where I feel weak and awash with self pity have gone (for now). At the moment I keep getting thoughts that I’ve beaten the smoking addiction and could probably have the odd cigarette now. This is obvious BS! Every time I’ve fallen for that - I’ve ended up smoking again. Right now I’m struggling with using sugar as a form of nicotine substitute🙄😳

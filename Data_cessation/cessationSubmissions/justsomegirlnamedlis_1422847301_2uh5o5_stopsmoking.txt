New here. Struggling through.

Just finishing up my 5th day nicotine free and I'm having a really hard time. I never realized how much I relied on smoking for everything from relaxing to passing time to dealing with difficult feelings. 
I want to quit. I want to be done,  but there's a lot of negative self talk in my head. If it's cool, I'm looking for support...

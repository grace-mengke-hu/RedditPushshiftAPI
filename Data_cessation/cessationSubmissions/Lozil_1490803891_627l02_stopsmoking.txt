Finally a Year...!!

Last years Good Friday I decided that the Smoking habit needs to die and I quit smoking. Today I am proud that I have not smoked for a year. Just to realise how easy it was after the initial first week.

It's a easy habit to get hooked into but difficult to get off. Took me almost 6 months of trying to quit before I finally called it a day.

So after quitting smoking I gained 10Kg of weight in 6 months (Lot of cooking and eating). Joined a Gym and  already got rid of 6Kg's in past 4 months I think I will keep the other 4Kg's suits me :)

Now, Next thing I am tackling is the beer consumption. Used to be Once in a week (500ML x 4 Cans) a year ago, But after quitting smoking I started grabbing a 500ML can here and there in between week and the volume vent up around (500ML x 8-10 Cans) per week. Realised that and now already stopped stocking things up in my refrigerator. 

All the best You just need your will power.

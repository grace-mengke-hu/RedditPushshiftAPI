Gum, patch and spray. Most effective and fastest acting?d

Hi there I am trying to help my girlfriend quit smoking and have worked her down to five a day. I usually leave her five in the morning for the day then refill her for the next morning only five a day but we seem to have hit a wall.
Working down to five was not much of a problem and we got there but going down to four a day puts a Lott of stress on her trying to go the time difference to miss out on that one.

I want to buy her something to help her cope through the tine difference to help cut down to three but I was wondering out of the chewable gums, daily patches and sprays, which is the most effective and fastest to act?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, or any tips in general to help us out to cut down and stop her smoking habbit.

Rough time

Been trying to quit for two weeks. Never made 24 hours. Made 12 a few times. Always the same. I throw out the cigarettes, then I'm ok, but once I go out, next thing I know I've bought a pack.then I throw them out again.its costing a fortune

I Listened to Allen Carr, that was good at first. I know he's right. But quiting is harder than I thought. He downplays the addiction part a little bit. For me the withdrawl symptoms are not so mild as he claims. Maybe because i have anxiety issues and use cigarettes to cope. 

Anyway, need to quit. I don't sleep well, I toss and turn in my sleep, probably don't get enough oxygen.

Just needed to vent.

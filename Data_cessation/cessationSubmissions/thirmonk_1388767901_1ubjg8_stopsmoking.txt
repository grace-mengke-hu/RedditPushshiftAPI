I've been a light smoker (about 5 per day) for 7 of the last 9 years. I've quit for lengthy periods a couple of times but keep coming back.

I signed up for a cool quitting service called quit text and they send me messages with tips and facts every couple days or sometimes a couple per day. It's nice because it gets me thinking about it when I otherwise wouldn't be. 

When I had signed up originally they have me a quit day of Jan 11th but after I finished the last cigarette in my pack this morning decided that this is the day.

I'm feeling confident. Damn confident.

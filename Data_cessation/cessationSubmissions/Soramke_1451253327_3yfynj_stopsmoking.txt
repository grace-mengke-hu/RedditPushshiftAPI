Helping my boyfriend quit from halfway across the country?

My boyfriend has smoked for years and is now trying to quit. It's a long-distance relationship, and while we're going to see each other for a bit in late January, right now I'm halfway across the country. We Skype and text a lot, though. Can you think of anything I could be doing for him to help encourage or distract him that I don't need to be there in person to do?

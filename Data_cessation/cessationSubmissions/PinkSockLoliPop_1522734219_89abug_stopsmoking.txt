How the hell do I go about quitting with a driving job?

I drive around town all day. Traffic sucks. The weather is gonna REALLY suck soon. I'm able to smoke far more often than not (personal vehicle). I have other issues to work out to make things not suck, sure, but for now smoking is my break from the chaos and frustrations that I deal with 5 days a week.

I still kinda enjoy smoking, but I know I need to quit. Shit's hard, yo.

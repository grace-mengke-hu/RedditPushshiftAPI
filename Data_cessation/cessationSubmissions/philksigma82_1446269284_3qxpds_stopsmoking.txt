Stress got to me...

Just removed my badge after 13 days, my life has been spiraling out of control since just before I quit and I wasn't able to control my cravings. I bought a pack after work and smoked one on the way home. I feel awful about failing but I think I learned a lot of valuable information about myself for the next time I quit, namely don't get cocky and have a couple beers after work.  Like Thomas Edison, I haven't failed I've just found 10,000 ways it doesn't work for me. 

I will be back with a vengeance as I have my first child on the way who in a short 6 months will be looking up to me for guidance. He/she was my inspiration and I want nothing more than to die a happy old man with my grandchildren by my side, but I just can't handle the stress of my babymomma leaving me as well as quitting right now.  I hope to be stronger tomorrow.

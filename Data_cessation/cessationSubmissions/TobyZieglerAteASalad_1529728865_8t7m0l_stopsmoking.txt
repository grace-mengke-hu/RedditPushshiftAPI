Help- Heavy Smoker but Nicotine Replacements Make Me Sick?

Long time lurker, huge fan of the sub. I’m 25yo F been smoking for four years, a heavy smoker for the past two. I’m not quitting immediately - I understand if that gets me hate, “there’s no trying to quit” sentiment I get- but I want to get down to two or three cigarettes a day, and then quit by my bday later this year. I’ve tried a quick google search and found nothing- I’m a half a pack/pack a day (I smoke 3 cigs in an hour long drive to work) but NRT seem to make me super sick?? The gum was the worst, I passed out on a bathroom floor, the patch made me vomit for hours. I’ve started using the lowest stage 3 step and I’m not getting super sick, but I get horrible headaches and embarrassingly visible muscle spasms. I’m not smoking while using it (obviously) and I follow directions. Any advice or explanation would be great??. My dad was a 30 year smoker and has been smoke free for 10 years (!) and he credits NRTs for making it possible. If this isn’t an okay post, I’m sorry and feel free to delete.

Just need a bit of encouragement

I'm 170 days in and over all I'm doing really good. I'm in better shape than I have been in years. I love the extra money, energy, tastes, and I really never want to smoke again. But I have a new room mate who smokes my former brand. I also am in a position where I need to find a job now. Like right now....I have interviews lined up, and will be putting my self out there to be judged...and ugh....I just ....crave....what I don't want. I know that cigarettes are the devil, and my mind will trick me when I'm weakest....and I guess this is just one moment I need to let pass, but if you have any kind words....thanks.

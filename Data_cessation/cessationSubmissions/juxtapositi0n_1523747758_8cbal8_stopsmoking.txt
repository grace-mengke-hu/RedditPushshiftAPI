Two weeks down! Thanks. &lt;3

OP here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/88o1rj/lets_get_this_over_with/

Been logging how I've been in the comments of that thread over the last 2 weeks, off and on.

I've been working out and eating better along with the elimination of cigarettes and nicotine.

I'm FREE! Good to have my badge back.

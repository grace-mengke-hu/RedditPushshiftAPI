One week!

I quit a week ago. The first 3 days sucked. I cursed out a customer service rep and felt very bad. Now the cravings aren't terrible but they come at odd times. I forget I'm a non smoker a lot. I wake up in the morning and think. "Coffee and cigarrettes!" But then I remember. I hope that starts to go away in a month or so..... Anyway thanks to everyone for posting encouraging things. And anyone who is about to quit you can do it!

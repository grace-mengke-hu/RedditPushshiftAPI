Smokefree Texts

Today is my quit day! I signed up last night for motivational texts, kinda thinking it would be corny & I wouldn't like it, but I LOVE it. Feels like I have a little buddy in my phone cheerleading me through this. You can text "crave" when you want & it will text back support-my favorite so far is "cravings aren't the boss of you". I usually don't like support because talking about smoking, even the negative health effects, when I'm trying to quit will make me fixate on it & want to smoke more. But the messages in the texts are distraction-based: drink water, eat a mint, the craving won't last long-so it works :)

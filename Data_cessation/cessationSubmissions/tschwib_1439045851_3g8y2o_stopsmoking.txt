A few thoughts from a guy who quit for 1,5 years, started again and is currently quitting again.

1) This has been said a lot but never forget, because that is what I did: You are always an ex-smoker and you will never be a non-smoker. This one cig you smoke after 6 months does not have to mean you will fall back all the way but it can do it easily. I thought "man I feel better than ever, I will never start this shit again, but what can 1 cig hurt now?" Well I was back at 1 pack a day within 2 months or so.


2) I experienced quitting as feel pretty good except for those sudden waves of utter dispair and cravings. Logic does not help you in those times of deep cravings... just conditioning. Just repeat in your "I won't do it, this will pass" or something like it. Reasoning with you cracing won't work.


3) If you are like me, don't tell people you quit unless they ask. Don't pride yourself infront of people for your smoking. If you do this, you start feeling that you are doing it for other people and not for yourself.


4) If you are like me, don't post too often in communities like stopsmoking, don't spent too much time reading books or looking at apps about quitting smoking. For the most part, pretend that you never smoked.


5) One of the hardest times during the quit is moving past the physical withdrawel. In a way physical withdrawel makes things easier because you have a sort of feedback for your success. When that passes you feel like before except without the smokes and you realize you have to life live without it for good and you need to fill the holes. This is at the 2 weeks mark for me.

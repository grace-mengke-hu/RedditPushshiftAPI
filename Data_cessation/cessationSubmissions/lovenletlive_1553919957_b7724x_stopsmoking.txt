After 2 months cigarette-free, picked up Vaping

Hi guys and gals. As the title suggests, I had quit cold turkey for 1 month and 27 days, and it was going great. I didnt miss the cigarettes, not the feeling they provided. To be quite honest, the idea of them still turns me off completely. 
A few days ago, I got into a very weird mood, darkish in a sense, and it felt like something took over me. Generally, I try to be a mindful person and process my feelings, but this was not something under my control. I drove to the vape store and bought a kit, with juice containing nicotine.
I dont intend on sticking with this long term, but in the larger scheme of things, how badly did I mess up? Would you guys/gals suggest I cut the nicotine out of the vape, throw it out all together right away, or set another quit date for the vape and follow through on that as well. 
I'm in shape, and am currently on a cut, &amp; I think the lack of being able to eat when I want is what drove me back here, with the flawed logic of "vaping will curb my hunger while I'm cutting weight". 
Please help. Not sure if I should count this as a failure? Be kind to myself and chart a new path forward? I'm of the belief that things happen when you're ready, but some advice would be great. 
No intention of going back to cigarettes btw. 
Love you all, and you're all great for what you're doing.

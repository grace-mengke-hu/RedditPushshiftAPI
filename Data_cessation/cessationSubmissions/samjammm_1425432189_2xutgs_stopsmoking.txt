tea is very useful for cravings :)

I had my last smoke on Feb 13, and i'm really happy about it!
i quit cold turkey, and i've found what helped me with the cravings was making a cup of tea ( i also quit drinking coffee because coffee and cigarettes went hand in hand for me, so the tea helps for resisting both )
by the time i prepared the tea, i forgot about the craving.
cutting up ginger (or any ingredient) for the tea helps a lot too, because then the preparation takes longer.
if you don't like tea, this won't be helpful to you, but maybe instead, making a smoothie would suffice :)

my cravings have started to get milder now too, and i've turned my whole mindset around about smoking! :D

Thoughts appeared about relapsing - I'm very afraid of my upcoming trip. I think I might not be strong enough.

So, I'm 25, I quit smoking almost 4 months ago. I am very glad about this decision and it was very easy (yes, with help of Carr). Now some time went by and I am still a happy non smoker. But this summer I am going on a 5 week outdoor vacation with 9 very good friends. And about 8 of them are smokers. I start to realize that it will be tough. And I hope my determination will stay - a lot can happen in such a long time. Also, all of them smoke weed - I guess sometimes I will smoke too (w/o tobacco of course - but with my own pipe). The problem is I haven't smoked weed in a very long time and I don't know how I would react to a craving while high.

Thanks for reading it.

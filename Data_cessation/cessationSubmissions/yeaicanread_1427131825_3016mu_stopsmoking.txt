Benefits of smoking cessation with an e cig

When you google benefits of "smoking cessation timetable" you can find numerous timelines showing the benefits of quitting smoking cold turkey.

I'm curious if anyone has found or would like to construct a similar timetable that includes using an e CIG as opposed to quitting cold turkey.

I venture to say, that your taste buds still improve on the same timeline, but center points of the discussion would include how quickly do your lungs heal if you're vaping? Tar isn't in ecig liquid correct? So if that's the case your alveoli should still heal even with vaping. Obviously some things such as peripheral circulation should improve given that your lungs are getting more oxygen easier right? I know nicotine has negative effects on the body. But my guess is that even at a higher nicotine content you still aren't receiving as much nicotine as a smoker would, and this would explain why many smokers encounter some withdrawals when first switching to vaping, albeit less intense than if they had quit cold turkey. 


Timetables requested as well as group discussions about your experiences as well as your opinions. 


People who never smoked and switched to vaping need not respond unless providing sources. Looking for first hand experiences here if nothing else.

Hopefully this gets up voted and enough people chime in.

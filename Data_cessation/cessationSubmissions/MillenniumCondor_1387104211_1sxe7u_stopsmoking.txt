What a terrible night (venting)

Had a rough time coping with social anxiety at a party tonight. On top of that I got into a fight with my SO who was there with me. First time in a couple weeks I was really tempted. Someone actually put a burning cigarette in my hand and said "hold this" as he went inside to get something. I paused for a split second before handing it off to some other smoker. 

But the worst of it was during the drive home. Used to be when I was depressed or anxious I would turn to cigarettes for solace. Smoked for so long they became like an old friend -- always there when you needed them, not to judge, just to provide you a bit of normalcy and to help you calm down. Realized that cigarettes are present in almost every memory of emotionally trying times. Whenever I've hit bottom, cigarettes have been there waiting for me.

Anyway, I didn't smoke. I just went home. I am depressed enough without having to endure the shame of relapsing. I would rather die.

TLDR: Had a shitty night which triggered a surprise craving, but I didn't cave. Also, fuck cigarettes.

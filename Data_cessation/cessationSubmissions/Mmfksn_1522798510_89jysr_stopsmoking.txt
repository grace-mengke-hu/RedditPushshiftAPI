Wanted to cut back. Day 2 and have only had 2 cigarettes. These inhalers have helped

I put the 21mg patch on in the am.  It really works until like 2-3.

The hand to mouth thing has sucked.  It has been hard to drive.  But these inhalers definitely help take the edge off when I feel like the patch isn’t working or wearing off.  They look stupid but have no smell, smoke and are tiny.  About 1.5” so no one even notices.

Just thought I’d throw it out there since I’ve never even heard of them before

This past weekend could've gone horribly wrong

Friday night, I went out with a few friends to a few bars, and everyone was smoking. It took everything in me not to ask someone for a smoke, but I somehow made it.

On Saturday, I had a coffee date that I was really nervous about. I desperately wanted something to calm my nerves. Still didn't have a cigarette.

On Sunday, I went to Pitchfork, where everyone was chain smoking. So much smoke in the air, it was driving me insane...but I didn't have one.

My chest feels like it's trying to rip itself out, but if I can survive those three events without giving in, I'd say I'm doing pretty damn good and should be proud. Keep it up, fellow quitters. We got this shit.

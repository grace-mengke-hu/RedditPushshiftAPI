Quitting sucks, but I'm trying.

My background; 
I'm 21, no job, no girlfriend. I'd say I'm bipolar but I'm no doctor.
I've quit several times in my life but I've always ended up coming back, one time I quit for a year before picking up smoking again.

Every day thoughts flood my head about smoking, usually if I get frustrated with something or if I'm happy, or when I drink coffee. It's such a habit, I think I need to buy some gum before I do something stupid..

I used to own one of those electronic cigarettes but I actually found they gave me severe chest pains (Iknowright? and cigarettes do not.)
I really wish I had one that didn't give me chest pains.

I've even distanced myself from my friends because they are all smokers and it gets really depressing. Almost every day I wish I could just have one, just one smoke, but I know that it would not be as satisfying as I think it would be and I wouldn't be able to quit again for another 6 months. In fact, the only reason I managed to quit smoking this time was because I developed a really bad case of bronchitis. 

I just wish I felt clean, not like my brain and body crave shitty chemicals.

edit: It's about 2-3 weeks since I quit.

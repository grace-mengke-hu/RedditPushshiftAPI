7 days and struggling

Hi!

I have been smoking for about 8 years. 8-9 smokes a day.

I've tried quitting many times before but my most recent attempt has been this best so far. It's just about a week today! I'm happy and I'm starting to feel better.

However, today my cravings are the strongest they've been yet. Not sure if it is because it is the weekend or what. I keep catching myself trying to justify buying a pack of smokes...

I'll only smoke one or two tonight, to celebrate! I keep telling myself...

Not going to.

Thanks, just wanted to say this publicly :)

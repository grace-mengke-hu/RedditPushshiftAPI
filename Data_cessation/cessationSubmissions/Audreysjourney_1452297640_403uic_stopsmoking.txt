Copd

Hi all has anyone stopped after being diagnosed with copd? Had 2 hellish chest infections since October and told in December I have copd. Stopped 9 days ago and feeling much better but has anyone had the same and will I get back to normal. Feel breathlessly after any activity which uses a bid of extra energy. Please post your experiences xx

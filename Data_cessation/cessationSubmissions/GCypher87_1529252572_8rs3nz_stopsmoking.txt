Second day

Hey everyone! I'm on my second day of no smoking. Yesterday didn't feel too hard, but today is a little worse. I know today and tomorrow are going to be the toughest. What's good is that even though I'm having crazy cravings I in no way feel that I won't survive without a smoke. This is way easier than I imagined it being.

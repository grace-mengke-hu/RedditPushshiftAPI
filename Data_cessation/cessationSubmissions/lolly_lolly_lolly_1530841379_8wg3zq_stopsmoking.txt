Just passed a year

20+ years for me. Just passed my first year without. I still miss it sometimes but I used to think that I wouldn't be able to go a day without wanting one. I don't anymore. Days go by - weeks, maybe, without thinking about having one.
If you can do the first day, you can do two. If you can do two, you can do a week. If you can do a week, you can do a month. You can do this. Is not as impossible as you think.

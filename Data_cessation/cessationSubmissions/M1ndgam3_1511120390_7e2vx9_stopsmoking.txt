Relapsed after two years. Looking to quit again, but it's hard.

Just hope this can serve as a warning to some who may be tempted to indulge in the pleasure of 'just one' cigarette after months or years of a successful quit.

I was a pack-a-day smoker for over ten years. One day, after a particularly heavy night of drinking and smoking two packs, I felt so shitty that I didn't even want to smoke for several days. I took advantage of that, and figured 'if I can quit for a day or two, why not permanently?' and I haven't bought a pack since that day. The cravings came and went, and I powered through it - managed to finish a master's degree, go through a job search, go through a breakup, start a new job, quit that job and start another, all without slipping once.

A few months ago I was at a party with old friends who are all smokers. At this point I thought I had controlled my addiction so well, hell, a couple of drags won't hurt. So I had a few puffs. Soon enough, I was asking friends for 'just two puffs'  whenever one lit up. For the past 6 months I've kept it under control, and kept it just to a few puffs, usually when having drinks. But those two puffs soon becomes just one cigarette, and then just two, and so on.

For the past week I've been smoking 3 or 4 cigarettes a day - I'm still not back at my old level of smoking, but I recognize that this has gone well beyond a 'slip' and I'm in a full-blown relapse. Quitting smoking was one of my greatest personal accomplishments, and one of the hardest things I ever did. Now I'll be starting all over from day 1. 

Guys, fight the urge to take that one drag. It's never just one.

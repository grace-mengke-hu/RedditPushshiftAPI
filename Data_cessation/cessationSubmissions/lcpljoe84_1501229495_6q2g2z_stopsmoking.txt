Gave myself canker sore to quit.

I was jonesin hard like REAL hard on day 5 of cold turkey at work.  Bit down on a peppermint shoved it into my cheek so hard it broke skin and gave me 2 canker sores.  The craving was so intense I had to hurt myself to get through it, although the canker sores were not my intention.  

Day 8 now and cravings still everywhere but somewhat less intense.  Has anyone else had anything weird like this?

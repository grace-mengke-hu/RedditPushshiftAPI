How to control rage when quitting?

I am trying to quit smoking cigarettes. I went from 1/2  a day to 5 a day in a year and I am quitting.  I am getting mad and full of rage when a minor inconvenience occurs. 

My dog ate one of my plants and I almost threw a chair at him. How do I control this rage? I am not going to pick up a cig!!

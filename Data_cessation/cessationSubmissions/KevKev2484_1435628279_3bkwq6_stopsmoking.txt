Day 4 of not smoking

Hello there.  I'm new to this subreddit.  I've smoked for about 15 years and I just quit 4 days go.  I've tried several times over the years and been unsuccessful.  Most of the attempts were Cold Turkey and I'd be smoking within 2 days of trying to stop.  I tried Chantix for a couple weeks once, but it make me so sick to my stomach that I couldn't finish it.  

This time I'm using a nicotine patch.  I'm surprised at how well it's helping cut down on the withdrawl symptons.  My "gotta have one now" moments are fewer and much less intense than previous attempts.  I'm so surprised at how quickly the benefits of not smoking are kicking in.  I can already smell a little better and I feel like I can breathe deeper, if that makes sense.  I know it's early but I feel very optomistic and I genuinely do not want to smoke.

I realized today how much I was using cigarettes as a justification and reward system.  I noticed most of my cravings come after doing or completing something.  Something piss you off?  Have a smoke.  Finished weeding the garden?  have a smoke.  Whether good or bad, the result was always to have a smoke.  I can't believe I'm just realizing this.

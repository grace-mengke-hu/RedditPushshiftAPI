feels like much longer :)

it feels like i havent smoked in years, not because i want to smoke but because life moves a little bit slower and i can enjoy things more, my energy, my health, my life is so much better already and the cravings to smoke are as good as gone. im eating better im training harder. it realy does get easier people, just never let your guard down :)

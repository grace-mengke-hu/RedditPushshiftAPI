Last time I quit smoking, I wanted to light the world on fire

... and it provoked my now ex-husband to blurt out that he wanted a divorce. 

That was about three years ago and I quit for about a year and just gave up. Lit up. And now I’m a smoker for the last few years. I hate it. And I’m scared that I will devolve into the withdrawal mess.

So I’ve been stepping down instead of going cold turkey (the last time I was a pack and a half day smoker, now I smoke about 6-8 sticks a day).

I got a prescription for Chantix this time, I’m using an app, and I’m reading the easy way to stop smoking (again) ... do y’all have any suggestions for curbing the asshole anger vomits that spew from withdrawal mouth? 

Thank you in advance!

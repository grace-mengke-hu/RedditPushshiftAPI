Something Else to Do

After 3 weeks of not smoking, I realized I had an extra hour each day that I wasn't wasting on going outside to smoke. I needed to fill that time with something, because I was still feeling a void. It had to be simple, non-committal, and easy to switch to/from.

My girlfriend and I are going on a roadtrip through Quebec in August, and decided we should pick up French again (we live in Ontario and took it for most of school).

So instead of smoking, I'm learning languages.

I am quiting

Some background. I a[m] 22. I smoke for 3 years. It is my throwaway acc cuz I am too ashamed to admit that I got addicted to cigarrettes... This is actually my second day without smoking.
In the first day I was feeling really down cuz I was smoking one cigarette after another. I was just f. addicted to this thing and it pissed me off. So I decided to stop. I want to use this post and comment to write my thoughts.
so day #1 went really ok, I was motivated. I wanted to not buy cigaretes this day. I was able to smoke one package a day and it was killing my wallet... I survived one day... Im going now to write thoughts from second day.

The Unfortunate Battle

It sucks that we'll be going through this battle for the rest of our lives.  We'll always be ex-smokers.  In stressful times, we'll always have the memory of the great, albeit temporary, stress reliever...cigarettes.  In times of happiness, our old friends will always be at the local corner store.  I think the hardest part about quitting, for me, is the realization that I'll never smoke another cigarette again.  I was taking a shower this morning and that's when it kind of dawned on me...the journey will never be over.

I'm happy that I've quit.  I feel much better and, after the withdrawals subsided a bit, am in much better moods.  I have more energy, not to mention more money.  I don't wake up on Sunday morning feeling like I've been kicked repeatedly by a donkey in the throat and chest anymore.  My senses of smell and taste are coming back, and I can breathe easier.  It just kinda hit me this morning that I'm one month down with the rest of my life to go.

Stay strong, friends.

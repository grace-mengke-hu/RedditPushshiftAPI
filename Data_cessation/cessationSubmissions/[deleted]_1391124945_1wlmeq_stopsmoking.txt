Day One

This is my third time trying to quit, but it's my first time getting support or even mentioning it to anyone.

My first time was back in August. I got sick and didn't feel like smoking, so I just saw how long it could last. Four days.
Then on Christmas while I was visiting my parents I ran out and didn't want to travel to get some more. Plus I was broke. That time I went a week.

Last night, I got drunk with some buddies. Fast forward past the passing out and whatnot, I woke up entirely too hungover to bother smoking. I'm at work now and left my cigarettes at home. Work is normally a trigger for me, but luckily all my coworkers at this shift are non-smokers.

I'm going to make it work this time, I know it. I'm giving what's left of my pack and all my rolling supplies to my roommate and be done with it altogether.

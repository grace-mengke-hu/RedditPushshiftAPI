40 Years Smoking, 23 days Quit

I feel proud, but scared. Am on patches so its a quasi quit. What happens when I quit the patches? Will I crumple, or stay smoke free? My mother told me best way to quit is never start-they always know best eh? Going to start doing some exercise, I think that will help. So far I have had non of the sore throats or coughing up grunge that others mention, I am actually looking forward to that as people say its a good milestone. I think this is going to be a long hard slog!

started chantix, worried about my combination of meds

as the title says, I was prescribed and just took my first dose of chantix. however,I am also prescribed adderall XR, and an intermittent instant release adderall - which I can attribute to at least 80% of my physical urges to smoke (because otherwise i detest it/the smell/the taste and do everything in my power to cover it up CONSTANTLY), as well as the routine of it. I wake up VERY early for work (often my alarm is set to 2-3am), I immediately take my adderall (empty stomach) and an hour later it's /always/ coffee and a cigarette time- and since it's an extended release pill, those "waves" of adderall hit at all the "right" (wrong) times - on my drive to work, on my break, upon leaving, and usually after if i have to do anything requiring any moderate mental/physical effort.. and I work in a coffee shop, so you can imagine it adds just a whole 'nother level to my problem.

i'm wondering if anyone has also had to experience this mix of prescriptions, any advice how i can somehow take one pill that disallows me from eating until usually 11-12, and simultaneously take one that requires me to -- or just any advice with this dilemma in general.

or y'know, just tell me my doctor is a fool and set me up for failure here maybe.

Last cigarette was 10/6/19. I thought my lungs were back to normal, but not quite lol

Played basketball last night, and I've been exercising slot since quitting, but due to the cold air I was breathing in, I got winded way faster than normal, and have been coughing up tar all morning which I thought had already cleared out of my lungs. So I guess three months isn't enough time for my lungs to heal

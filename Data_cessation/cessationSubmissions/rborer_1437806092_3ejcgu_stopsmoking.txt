3 1/2 hours til quitting time

I am working until 06:00 hrs and ive decided that will be the last time i smoke.  I have a 3 day break from work which is really the hardest time I have with smoking.  (911 dispatch//12 hr shifts)...I am 30 years old and have been smoking since I was 13.  Ive tried countless times to stop but I dont think I was ready those times, but i am feeling good about this time... Any suggestions?

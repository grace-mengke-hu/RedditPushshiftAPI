absolutely losing my mind (Day 2)

Warning: rant ahead. So I'm at the 48 hour mark of absolute no cigarettes or tobacco. I have been vaping, but the nicotine has been doing very little for me. Heck, I had my 0 mg liquid in my tank all day yesterday and didn't even realize. I don't know what that's about, because today as I switched back over to my 6mg I've been in a complete and total state of emotional meltdown all day. I don't even know how I got through my shift at work without losing my shit. My poor, poor wife has had to put up with me all day and I honestly feel bad for them. I deal with a lot of depression, anxiety, and hypomanic episodes, and my brain seems to be hitting the whole spectrum with full intensity today. 

But...I haven't smoked. I don't want to. It feels like my body and brain are CRYING for it but I just refuse to give in. I don't want to be a slave to a leaf anymore. I don't even want to stay a slave to this stupid vape pen, but it's a stepping stone. I'm sick of my clothes and hair smelling like smoke. I'm sick of having to go outside every half hour just to get more nic in my system. I'm sick of my wife not wanting to kiss me very much because of my tobacco breath. Sick of being unable to run for more than half a block without losing my breath. So many reasons to quit. I've come such a short distance but I have my entire life to go. Please wish me luck.

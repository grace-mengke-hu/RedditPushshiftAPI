Ups and Downs

Stress.  Stress.  Stress.  Shitty conference call today.  Like.  Real Shitty.  Can't figure out how to fix a 3 year project and don't want to quit because I believe in the company, the opportunity is there and so is the financial reward.  I just... wish I could get a different project.  But... I can't stay where I am for another 3 years.  I get paid commission.  I need to make a living. Almost quit my job half a dozen times.  Left work early to get a beer and cool off instead. 

Almost bought a pack of cigarettes on the way home and hit a bar and went to a fun ass concert tonight.

But instead I'm going to the gym.  Right now.  Just gotta make it through today.  I'll worry about excessive drinking this weekend when my buddy's in town and how to deal with that later.  Right now.  I just need to make it through today.  Stress. Stress.  Stress.  FUCK! Fuck.  Fuck...

One week strong, gotta give credit to vape nation

I know most of you have been smoking for way longer than me, but after 2 years of 5-15 cigs a day, my lung function is down 20%-30%, so I need to stop right now. I bought a vape last Monday and haven't smoked a cig since. I know vapes kind of have a douchey aesthetic to them, but it's incredible how effectively it has sated my nicotine cravings. To everyone who has tried patches and gum and hasn't been able to quit, consider giving vaping a try. For the first time in years I can take a full, deep breath without wheezing or coughing.

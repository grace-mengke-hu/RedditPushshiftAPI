Advice on quitting please.

Hi all. I've been making repeated attempts to quit smoking and on this particular attempt I'm currently up to day four. The problem is, as soon as the cravings subside a little (around day four or five usually) I instantly let down my guard and have these weak, poor-excuse thoughts that inevitably lead to me smoking again. I use these super transparent justifications... I tell myself I've made it through the toughest part (obviously I *haven't*!), that it was easy (it *wasn't*!) and that I can do it again and do it properly next time (I *never do*!). Look, I'm sure you've heard all this before and so I'm sorry for boring you all... but I just wanted to ask; *how did you guys keep going?!!* I start out all gung-ho... I feel unstoppable, invincible, excited, and optimistic and then slowly but surely, all of this positivity drizzles down the drain until finally BOOM! and I buy a packet. Any advice on maintaining strength and motivation and achieving longevity would be hugely appreciated. Thank you.

Just a weird observation.

This is probably not insightful and probably wont help anyone quit. It's just an odd self observation. 

I recently was asked to go to the store for someone to buy some cigarettes. Buying cigarettes doesn't bother me or make me want to smoke - well except that it's asked of me often enough to be annoying. The store I usually pick them up at were out of the particular brand so I went down the street And they said "We don't sell that brand. Sorry" My immediate reply was "That's O.K. I don't smoke any more anyway!" and went out the door. 

This guy doesn't know me, doesn't know if I ever smoked or not, and doesn't care. But for some reason I thought letting him know  to feign uncaring was a good idea.  I probably gave them the impression that I was pissed off. "I'm not an addict, damn it!"

In a strange way it's an ex smokers "ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY!?"

Nearly gave in tonight after argument but I didn't and im elated so very proud of me!!!!

My earlier post was I was about to cave after an argument with my hubby but in the end i determined to tell him to screw off and spend the evening ignoring him and making him sleep on the sofa was a much better option than opting for a ciggie (or pack of ciggies) so that is in fact what I opted for!! I am now sitting feeling very proud of myself that's the most temptation ive felt since I quit an I got past it, my 'smoke free' app says 488 not smoked so I really feel if I can ignore that many I can definately ignore the 1 (or 10 or 20) I probably would have smoked tonight 
I can go to sleep happy knowing I didn't need nicotine to deal 
to those who were there to support me tonight thank you guys from the bottom of my heart I couldn't be more thankful of your support, to all those just starting their journey I hope you succeed and wish you every bit of luck, and you awesome guys who are far in their journey... I hope to join you, no scrap that..... I will join you soon enough

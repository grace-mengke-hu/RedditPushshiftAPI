3 Months in and I faltered (tl;dr at the end)

I don't post much, folks, but I figured I'd share with y'all. 3 months in and things had been going great. Then this week happened. I had made a down payment on a new place, and was in the process of moving in but my truck broke down. I'm a decent mechanic, but I don't have what I need to fix this. The tow truck driver had me do most of the work, overcharged me and wouldn't accept a credit card. This whole at work we were being visited by corporate higher ups and they were breathing down our necks every day. To top that off, we were strangely extremely busy. Then code enforcement comes by and tags my truck for "being on blocks" (it was jacked up in the air while I attempted to fix it). And to top it all off, I turned 30 this week. Today, I was at my wits end between bill collectors, trying to fix my truck and then arrange a tow to a more competent mechanic, the stress from work and some stress from my family. I broke down. I texted my support telling them I was thinking about lighting up. Nothing. I guess they were busy. I was crying on the way to convenience store. I bought a pack. I drove down my favorite spot of seclusion and lit up.

Holy shit, those things are terrible! Halfway through my smoke I had to throw it away and I ran over the pack with the truck I was borrowing. I have no idea how I thought this was cool for 15 years! I came home, showered, threw my clothes in the laundry and drank some coffee. Never again. Those things suck. 

Tl;dr: Stressful week had me buying a pack. Couldn't make it through one smoke it was so nasty.

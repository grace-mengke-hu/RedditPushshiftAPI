Unusual withdrawal symptom?

I keep reading everywhere that stoppers have trouble sleeping, but I feel tired and exhausted all day long. When I lay down I fall asleep almost instantly. If someone else experienced the same, when does it stop? 

Shit, I thought I would be over it in a couple of days... :(

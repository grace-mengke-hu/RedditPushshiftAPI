When I feel like smoking, I pretend I've just had one and I'm finished..What would I be doing after just finishing a cigarette?

I know it's not really the best thing to imagine, because then it's still in your head that cigarettes are precious and you need them.  I'm having my first glass of wine since quitting, and the urge was strong.  So I imagined that I'd just finished one, and lo and behold, I was in exactly the same position as before the imagined cigarette.. A real one would not have changed my life for the better.

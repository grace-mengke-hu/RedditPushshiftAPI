Meaning to say thank you for awhile...

Seriously thank you. If it wasn't for this sub I wouldn't have quit.  Two and a half years smoke free. I'm so proud of myself. 

I feel slightly guilty because after a time I had to unsub, I'm not sure why... But I never gave back what I got, so here I am. 

Reading all the tips and tricks, especially about people who smoked a pack plus a day and quitting, made me think well hell, if they can do it, why can't I? Some people are so inspirational. 

Well done to everyone who has quit, and well done to everyone who gives support. 

To everyone who's on the journey, just fucking do it.  Best tip I can give, don't let nicotine enter your body EVER again. Not once.

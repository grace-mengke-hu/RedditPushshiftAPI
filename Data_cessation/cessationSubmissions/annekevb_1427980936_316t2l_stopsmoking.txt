2 months huge craving

I had a huge craving last night...  I've been smoke free for just over two months now.  Yesterday was kind of hard, big decision day regarding my personal life and I almost fucked it up... I was literally on the brink of buying smokes... PFFF close one!  I was saying to myself, well, it doesn't matter, it's just a smoke... well anyway!  I didn't do it!!! Happy times!!

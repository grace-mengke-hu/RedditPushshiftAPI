I just need strength.

I’m losing my mind tonight.  One week through.  That’s great.  But life has smashed me in 36 hours.  Yesterday I found out a friend of mine has ovarian cancer.  Monday night I was texting with another friend- probably my best friend really.  He’s long distance and he was complaining of a severe headache and some weird symptoms.  Finally went to the ER and came home thinking he just had some virus. Yesterday I tried to reach him - nothing.  I knew something was wrong.  He’s been so supportive with my quitting and in generally he is always responsive.  Today I went to work with that pit in my stomach as I still had no word from him.  I passed the gas stations and supermarkets and 7-11s.  My anxiety was pulling me but I didn’t give in.  This evening I got a text from his friend down there that he is in the hospital and suffering severe neurological symptoms- altered mental state, confused- not making sense, can’t stand on his own.  Clearly something is extremely wrong and I’m terrified.  I am many states away- I can’t see him and I’m just waiting to hear what they figure out.  I thought the not knowing was bad, but this is worse.  I’m on the verge of giving in here- I need help tonight.

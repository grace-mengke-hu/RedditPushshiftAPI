I'm 30 days in brah.

I gotta say,the struggle, withdrawl and nightmares are well worth it and I am not looking forward to smoking again. Im breathing better, I have more energy, and I'm fucking RICH! I dunno what to say I'm speechless. Life really does get better guys and gals. Hell I'm about to quit again its good!

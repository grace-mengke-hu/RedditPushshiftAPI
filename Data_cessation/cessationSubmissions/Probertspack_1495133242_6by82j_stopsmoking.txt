Tackling a 30 year addictive bad habit

I'm going to kick smoking from my life! A pack a day will disappear. My cravings (which are currently horrifically bad) will subside. Using a 20 nicotine patch is in my plan, as a mobile app which feeds me encouraging information. I thought including a public support forum (you/Reddit) in my upcoming battle to detach myself from the unhealthy and costly bad habit would alleviate some of the unforeseen challenges that will surface. Wish me luck and good luck to you as well.

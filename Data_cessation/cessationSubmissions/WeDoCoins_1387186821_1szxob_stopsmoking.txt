Today is Day 2

Today this afternoon will be day 2 of not smoking cannabis....
I am a daily smoker, do not smoke cigarettes but did smoke since the age of 14/15. One local friend mentioned it as a challenge and I said no problem ill quit for NewYears Eve or the new year.  Instead that day I challenged my friend who smokes cigs.  She has not quit....and now I am on day two.....

As a reward for not smoking for 2 months, I whitened my teeth

My teeth were pretty yellow from smoking, drinking coffee, etc, and had bothered me for a while. Didn't really like seeing pictures of myself smiling. As a reward for not smoking for 2 months, I bought a 2-Hour whitening kit from Walgreens (Rembrandt brand if you're interested) and watched a few episodes of The Walking Dead. My teeth are definitely whiter and it feels like I've reversed some of the superficial damage done by the cigarettes I smoked. I recommend it!

About 2 and a half months is where I relapsed the first time I quit (see badge), but I don't think it's going to happen again. My reward for when I hit 3 months is new clothes. Incentives are a huge help! 

I couldn't imagine smoking at this point. My lungs feel clear, my mouth is all sparkly and fresh, my clothes don't smell, food tastes great... Quitting is tough, but only in the moment. Good luck!

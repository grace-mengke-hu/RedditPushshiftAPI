To my boyfriend.

Dear Boyfriend,

Today is your 4th day without a cigarette. It's been about 10 years since that's happened, hasn't it? 

I just want to say- I am so proud of you. I've been telling you I'm proud of you all the time, but I'm not sure you understand. I think you hear my words as gentle, calculated encouragement, a means to get what I want too (you know how I've wanted you to quit.) 

It's hard to find the words that say I know you are doing something that's so challenging, something that gets the better of people every day, and you are doing it for you and for us, and how it fills with respect and admiration.

I haven't always been helpful. I would go out with you every other time you'd smoke, ask to bum a cigarette, and then act like it's not my problem too. That was stupid and completely hypocritical. I would nag you to go on a run with me, because why not make **two** life altering changes at the same time?


I know it's going to get harder. I wish you would be able to tell me exactly what I could do to make it easier, but I know a lot of the time there's not going to be an answer. Last night you said you wanted to quit so we would have more time together, and it makes me want to cry just thinking about it.


So, my promise to you is that I will listen more. I will be patient and understanding more. I will stop trying to push you to do what I think is right, because I have complete faith that you know that already, and can do anything you put your mind to. 

You can do this babe.

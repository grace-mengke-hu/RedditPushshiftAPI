16 days over!! Got myself a few drinks second times today...

So, I have completed 16 days without smoke and I feel really amazing. I felt like treating myself with a couple of beers so I did and again, I didn't feel like smoking at all this time around too!!

Now every time my mind thinks about smoking, first images replicate the feeling of the smoking passing through my throat (Meh!! Hurtful and disgusting) and then that same shit (which is full of CO,Tar, Nicotine and tons of unidentified chemicals) getting absorbed in my lungs. 

This turns me away from even holding an unlit cigarette in my hand, forget smoking.

Bonus: I also challenged myself to have a packet with me for 48 hours (which I was holding for a friend of mine who doesn't carry his cigarettes home) and I was able to handle it successfully! 

Better days are coming I guess!! :)

Day 6

I am currently on day 6 into the quit and I'm struggling a bit but keeping the motivation to make it 1 full week without a cigarette which will be the longest I have gone without one in around 5 years.

I have not gone out drinking yet which is the hardest situation for me as this is how I got into this filthy habit. Luckily none of my friends smoke which should make it easier but does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation when I do go out?

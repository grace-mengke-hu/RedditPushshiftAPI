Day One

Quitting today after almost 10 years of smoking. Can't stand smelling horrible, having that nasty taste in my mouth, and always worrying about when the next time I can smoke is. I have Allen Carr's book loaded up on the Kindle, a whole case of water, and my dog here by my side to keep me company. Wish me luck!

Trying to quit after 5 years. What do you think about e-cigarettes?

Hey
I'm 23 years old, turning 24 in a few months. I started exactly 5 years ago in August. I remember I used to think that I could quit any moment. I was also able to not smoke for like 4-5 days without any problems if I had to do some family stuff & etc. I can't do that any more. I have been going through a pack a day for like 2 years now without skipping a day. I never really thought about quitting, but I got some bad pains in my chest and back area yesterday. It's painful to cough or walk down the stairs so I decided I must quit. My sister is going to do it aswell so I guess that helps a little bit.

 I am pretty sure that this will be very hard, so I thought I'd ask you guys about the e-cigarettes. Do you guys support them? Any problems with them? I don't know if it's actually quitting if I take up another type of addiction. It's gonna take a few days anyways for them to get here if I decide to buy them, so I'd love to hear your opinion.

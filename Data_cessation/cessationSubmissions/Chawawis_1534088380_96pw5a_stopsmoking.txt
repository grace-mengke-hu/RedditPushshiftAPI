4 days down! Can't stop eating.

I usually don't eat until 1-2 in the afternoon.  I'm not really hungry during the day, but the second I start eating it's like a switch gets flipped, and I'm ravenous.  Definitely feels like eating releases something in my brain similar to what cigarettes do, and I need more and more of it to get my "fix".  Anyone else experience this??

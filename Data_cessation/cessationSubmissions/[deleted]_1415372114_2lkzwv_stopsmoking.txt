Relapsed after 6 days....

Back to day 1....

I've been smoking a pack a day for 10 years since the age of 16. Last year my wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter and ever since then I've been trying to kick the habit. I want to be able play with my child without getting out of breath and becoming fatigued. I want to see her grow up... I don't want to influence her if she sees me smoking.

I've been successful a few times. The first attempt lasted 2 months, second attempt 3 weeks and my latest attempt lasted only 6 days. 

My main issue is smoking at work, I've managed to cut down to only 3 or 4 smokes a day... But every time I relapse it's at work. I know it's probably the routine, but I don't seem to have this problem with quitting smoking when at home or on my days off. 

Any advice would be appreciated as I seem to be running out of ideas.

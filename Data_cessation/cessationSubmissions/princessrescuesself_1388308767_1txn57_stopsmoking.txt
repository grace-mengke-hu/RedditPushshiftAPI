3 weeks plus one day on my cakeday!

Just thought you ought to know :)  This time quitting has been easier than my past efforts.  I have been using the much-debated within this sub e-cig for some time and exclusively in the last 3 weeks.  I wanted to say thanks to the members of this sub for being so good to each other.  I don't post here a lot, but I have been lurking for quite a while and have gotten so much out of reading your stories and seeing you all support each other.  I've smoked since I was 15, and at a rate of about half a pack a day since I was 18.  That makes it about 16 years.  I'm going off of bc this summer and will start trying for a baby right away and I don't want to pass this terrible dependency on to the potential child.  After a month has passed, I plan to taper the nicotine down to zero mg.  I have cravings for a real cig from time to time, but feel pretty good about this try.  If I can do it, so can you!

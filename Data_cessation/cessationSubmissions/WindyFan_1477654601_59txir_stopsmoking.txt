Feeling very shitty and not really sure what to do

So, I am not a smoker, or so I've been telling myself for years.

I have never smoked cigarettes and always have been big on "Smoking is for idiot, I'd never take up on smoking" but I'm realizing how much of an hypocritical idiot I actually am since I've been smoking joints almost daily for two years now.

I have nothing against weed but now I smoke because I feel the need to rather because I want to and it kills me.

I tried switching to pipes and not add any tobacco but I also just realized that a weed high is so much different than tobacco/weed, I didn't even know tobacco would give you this feeling.


Anyway, I'm quite lost right now, I have no appetite and feel shitty all the time, have this huge knot in my stomach all the time and feel like puking every time I try to eat without smoking first.

Is this what being addicted to nicotine feels like? Please tell me it gets better

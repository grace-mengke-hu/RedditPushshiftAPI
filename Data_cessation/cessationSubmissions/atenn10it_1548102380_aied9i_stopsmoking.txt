Feeling of something stuck in my throat

Quit smoking twice for a month each time but then again started smoking like for the last couple of months and had alcohol with my friends twice this weekend.
For the last couple of days I have a weird feeling of something stuck in my throat with constant burps. I am afraid that it could be throat cancer..should I be worried ?

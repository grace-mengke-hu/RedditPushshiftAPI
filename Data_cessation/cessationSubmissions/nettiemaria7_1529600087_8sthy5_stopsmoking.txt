Round 2 quit (totally) ..identified triggers

Hello all. Just started Day 1 Total Quit (again)!  I have 3 serious triggers.  One is my mom smokes...the other is anger (these are the worst) and the other is stress.  I have decided to carry  meds and unfollow ppl on FB for hateful political posts) so that takes care of anger and stress.
    Now the Mom thing I don't know how to get through this yet.  
Any ideas helpful.
Thanks for letting me write.

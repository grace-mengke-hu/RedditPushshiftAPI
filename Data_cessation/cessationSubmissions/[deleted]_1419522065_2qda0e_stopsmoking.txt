Merry Christmas, let's do this!

This is my 3rd time quitting.  The first time I quit for almost a year.  The second time I quit for almost two years.  This will be my third attempt at quitting cold turkey.  

This is how I deal with my cravings currently.  I've come to the conclusion that the cravings that I get whilst trying to quit are no different from the cravings I get as a smoker.  I have proven to myself both as a smoker and non-smoker that no matter how bad I want a cigarette, these cravings do go away eventually.  

Simple examples are being stuck in the office when I have a lot of work to do and I can't sneak out for a smoke.  It would suck for the first 15 minutes, but afterwards I'd forget I wanted a smoke and focus on doing my job.  

Secondly, more often than not, I'd already be craving another cigarette shortly after I've already smoked one.  If I continue to smoke, these cravings will remain no matter what.  Therefor, it just seems illogical to continue smoking when there will be no difference in my cravings regardless if I smoke or not.  

This has also helped deal with cravings on a case-by-case basis.  When I get a craving, I wait for 5 minutes.  After those 5 minutes, I compare to how I felt before the time started.  The immediate need for nicotine is normally gone after 5 minutes.  After 10 minutes, I stop thinking about the craving.  

I still have a lot of challenges to face like going out with friends that are smokers, not taking my smoke breaks at work and so on and I know it's only been a couple of days but I figured I should share with you guys since I know this subreddit has helped me with quitting in the past as well.

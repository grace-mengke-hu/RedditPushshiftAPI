Looking for some understanding with regards to my quitting situation.

Hi there.  About 1 year ago I found I was able to ease physical tension through 1 puff of cigar (the ones in gas-stations like pompom or blackstone).  Usually it would take me a couple days to go through one but I reached the point where I consumed 1 per day, sometimes even 2 if party-times.  Now I have some soreness in throat... I think I should not use these more than special occasion.

The key here is that the times that I stopped (once last month, once last week), the soreness in throat and resistance to breathing increased.  Can quitting cold-turkey mess with my breathing; should I "taper-off" instead?

Really I just think about the exciting stuff I could develop in life, and don't want to fuck up my opportunity to do so by dying or hindering my athletic capacity.  I think I should be OK if I stop smoking these things more than special occasions, because I only used them for a year.

Any insight is much appreciated!

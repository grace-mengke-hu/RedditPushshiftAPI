Serial quitter trying this yet again

I lost count how many times I've tried to quit. 200? One of three things get me, sometimes in conjunction: stress, boyfriend smoking, or my brain telling me to get just one more pack and THEN be done. I've cut it down to two to three cigarettes a day and my semi-withdrawals from that have me pissed off at times. I'm usually a super kind person, but the other day I was bitchy to a total stranger. That's not me. That's not who I want to be. So I'm trying this again today. I'm only 27 and it's hard to breathe properly or take deep breaths--something just isn't right about that...

Edit: Wanted to add that I am really looking forward to this sub and other resources helping me out when I crave. I know it gets way easier after the first month (been there many times, and I was actually quit for 2 1/2 years one time...)

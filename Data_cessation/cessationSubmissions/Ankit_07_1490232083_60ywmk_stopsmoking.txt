The hard work to not smoking starts today

I'm a 21 years old and I'm smoking cigarettes from last 6 years but from last 3 years I've smoked a packet daily and now smoking has started to give me some serious stomach issues, breath issues, stamina issues, and also I tried to quit it for like 10-12 times but was not able to resist the urge of smoking and always smoked after 2-3 days of my quitting decision.
Now, I'm going to quit smoking from today for ever.
I just hope that this time I won't back down.

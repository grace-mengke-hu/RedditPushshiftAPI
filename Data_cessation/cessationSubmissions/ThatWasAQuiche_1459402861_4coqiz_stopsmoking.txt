I may have discovered something.

So, ill try to make this as short as possible.
I smoked for 5 years, 3-4 packs a week. Failed quitting 4 times, and now it's my fifth attempt, on day 13 and I feel great. 

I only had any cravings in the first 5 days and now I don't think i'm experiencing  them at all. 

I started to smoke medical marijuana (yes I am licensed) for my anxiety disorder some time after my 4th attempt to quit smoking cigarettes.

Yes I did try pharmacy meds and therapy before even considering weed as an option and neither worked for me. the pills made me feel like a robot and I felt like I just wasn't taking anything away from therapy sessions.

So I use medical marijuana and as often as possible I use a vaporizer to get high, so i'm not polluting my lungs the same way I was with cigarettes. And i'm beginning to wonder if maybe quitting smoking seems like a breeze to me because i'm smoking weed now and it gets rid of/combats the shitty cigarette withdrawals? 

Does this sound possible? or is the worst still to come? I've never made it too far in my earlier attempts at quitting.

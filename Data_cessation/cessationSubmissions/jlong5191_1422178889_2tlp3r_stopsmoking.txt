77 days

77 days without a smoke. In 13 days my company will reimburse the tobacco surcharge they have been garnishing my paychecks with. Excellent motivation when strict corporate rules are involved! Couldn't have done it without the support from this community, my friends, wife, and my shrinking bank account.

Although the money I've saved from NOT buying a pack a day. Holy moly.

Peace, fellow quitters

day 2ish

I quit drinking 9 months ago and picked up full time smoking. I eat pretty well and bike commute so I am always active. I hate that I smoke. I hate how I feel after I have smoked and when I am biking my lungs burn. And the feelings I get when I "NEEEEEED" a cigarette are disgusting. 

I had one yesterday morning after breakfast and that was my last one. I was such a cunt yesterday afternoon into the night. I ended up putting my son to bed early and going to bed myself by 830pm becasue I felt bad that I was just shouty at everyone.

But I can do this, I managed to quit drinking so this should be easy.

right....

i hope....

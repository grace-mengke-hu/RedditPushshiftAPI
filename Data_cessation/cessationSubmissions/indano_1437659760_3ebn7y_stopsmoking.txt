Thanks! Made it to 1/2 year with your help.

I made it to 6 months.  I am super proud! But more importantly, I am grateful.  This subreddit is so important to me.  I check it almost daily.  and you people are simply wonderful.  Keep up the good work.  The people have created something really awesome here.  Have a great day! I know I will, because I can't wipe this silly grin off of my face.

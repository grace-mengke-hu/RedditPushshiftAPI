Really want to quit. Don't want to lose my job.

I wish I had never started smoking. It started out as a social crutch and has now transformed into a physical need. I don't want to structure my days around how and when I can smoke. 

But when I get to about 4 hours since my last cigarette, my brain stops functioning until I smoke a cigarette and my head is clear again and I can work.

How do you function normally while you're quitting? How do you perform well at work while you can't think about anything except the head-clearing cig?

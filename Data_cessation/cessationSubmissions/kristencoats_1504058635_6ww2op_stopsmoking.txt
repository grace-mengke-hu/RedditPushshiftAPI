I can breathe!!

I've always had a special place in my heart for yoga. I would do yoga and run a little as a teenager, I started smoking at 17 and stopped. I've gotten back into it over the years, got sick and couldn't walk for a few months and it literally helped me to walk again. I got lazy after I started feeling better and to be honest I always thought what's the point of working out and then smoking a cig. I also couldn't breathe during a lot of the moves which is very important in yoga. Over the last week I started up again slowly, it was hard at first but after I couple of days I could feel the benefits. Tonight I decided to step it up (I use an app called SWORKIT) I stretched, did some yoga and then decided to do a workout called Brazilian butt lift. I have never been able to work out like that! It had a lot of hard moves like squats, lunges and things I would never even attempt when I smoked. I'm proud do say I competed the whole thing, started breathing hard but for the first time it was because I was working up a sweat and not because I couldn't breathe! It's really starting to sink in that I am free from that disgusting habit and I can REALLY be healthy again! Oh and I did not have any coughing fits during my workout!!

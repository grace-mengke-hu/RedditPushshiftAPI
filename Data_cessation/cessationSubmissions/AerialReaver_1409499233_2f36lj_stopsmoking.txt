134 days!

134 days smoke free since I posted here last about caving in and resetting my badge. I'm still on the e-cig but when I first quit I was at 26 mg nicotine, I'm down to 10mg now. Bringing down the nicotine gradually like by 2 mg every time I get a new bottle of juice. I might have to go down at even higher intervals here soon cause the 10mg is almost getting wayy too strong in the setup I got now. My goal has always been to be completely nic free and I knew I couldn't do it cold turkey. But knew once I made that first step to quit analogs, bringing down the nic level would be the easy part. I feel a lot better, not wheezing at night, and not coughing all the time. Just wanted to update and say that It's not about how you quit, it's that your quitting, one quit method is not going to work for everyone, just know that you're one step closer to being completely nicotine free like me. Don't believe the fear mongering about e-cigs because they worked for me!

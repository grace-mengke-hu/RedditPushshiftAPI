I want to quit smoking and would like some advice. (Read that as: I'm desperate for help)

What's the best way yall have found to start the process? 


Set a date in the near future and slowly decrease until that date?


Cold turkey?


Nicotine replacement? (Patch, vape, gum, etc?)


I've recently changed my diet and exercise which resulted in being over 40 pounds lighter and very close to the best shape I've been in in my life. So, that leaves smoking as my next self improvement project.


I've been smoking for over 20 years, and I'm tired of it. Just the thought of being without cigarettes makes me nervous. But I'm truly sick and tired of it. For a little background if it helps, I have a very high stress life situation right now and cigarettes help to keep me sane. I fully realize that is obviously the mental addiction speaking. 

Any and all advice is needed and most welcome, thank you in advance.

Question for patch users...

Hey y’all! I’m using the patch to quit. I’ve been o it for a week now. I know the pamphlet says to use step 1 for 6 weeks but I was wondering if anyone has done step 1 for a shorter time and was still successful. I don’t want to jeopardize my chances of being successful with this. I just figure 2 weeks wouldn’t make that big of a deal. Any thoughts?!?

Caved in after my first attempt of quitting, and now starting from scratch

Dear Reddit,
I relapsed today, and had 2 cigarettes after my last attempt of quitting which was on May 11th,2018. I have no idea why but the last few days before caving in, I had the urge. The craving for nicotine was hurting my head and I managed to get my mind of it. I had no idea it could get this bad after months of quitting. Today was the worst as my mind was thinking about smoking and could not get rid of the thoughts. 

When I puffed on the cigarette, I felt like a loser who lost its fight. The hard work I put in to quit nicotine for good has gone to waste. I used to smoke a pack a week since I was 17 years old and the cravings was bad. Presently as a 21 year old, I am aware of the consequences and the costs associated with it. Even puffing on it made me feel gross and I can feel how bad I smell right now. I was wondering if people have tried more than one time to quit and have successfully quit after their first attempt? To make matters worse, I have a midterm tomorrow that I think I will do well on but the guilt associated with doing it makes me feel so bad. I probably will stay up all night thinking about this and feel very guilty. I feel so helpless now that my streak is ruined.

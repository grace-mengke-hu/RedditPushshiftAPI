Unfortunately I failed

I'll need to find my reasons to quit once again, but I cannot stress this enough: do NOT quit for ANYONE but yourself. Don't quit for a family member, don't quit for a special someone don't quit for any reason except that YOU want to. At some point down the road that someone could easily disappoint you and your urge to light up again hits. So my advice to those getting ready to quit this.

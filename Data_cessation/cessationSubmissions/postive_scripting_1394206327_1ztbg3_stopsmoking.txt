Been a year.

I quit smoking with the help of this sub. I agreed to quit along with another user -- for which I hope he succeeded as well. Thank you thank you thank you. All the words you guys said these past year, served as a mental crutch on a journey that only us, smokers could appreciate. I almost didn't take the first step. I almost unsubbed. But the unanimity of this group in prevailing against a common foe is what made me take the first step. To all lurkers, the first step is always the hardest. Dont worry at failing on your first try. I failed time and time again as well. I know you've heard these words before but I hope this time, it could make a difference and youd hear it in another light. You can do it.

Thanks again people, for this free service to humanity.

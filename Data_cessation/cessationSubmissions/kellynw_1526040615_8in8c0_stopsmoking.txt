25 days in with terrible insomnia

Is insomnia a normal side effect of quitting cold turkey? I smoked for 11 years (started when I was 16) and I've always had trouble falling asleep, but I've never had a problem staying asleep or falling back asleep if I wake up. I did a sleep study a few years ago while I was still a smoker, but my doctor said it was inconclusive other than me not having sleep apnea. CBD oil edibles seem to help a little bit, but the only thing that guarantees me a solid night of sleep is a medium dose (1.125mg) of lorazepam. I really don't want to become addicted to pills, but I can't seem to stay asleep any other way.

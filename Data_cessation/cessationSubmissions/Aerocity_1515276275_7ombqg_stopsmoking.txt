Made it to a week.

I've been on patches since December 30th, no cigarettes, lowering my dose quicker than I should've and not even using one today. Not surprisingly, I spent the day in a massive panic attack and ended up buying a pack, smoked two out of it. I'm glad I've had enough time for my taste to come back, because this is disgusting. Spending the next 24 hours back on a half patch and I'll be weaning off much slower this time to make sure my body adjusts properly and I'm not thrown into shock next time.

Now I'm gonna break out the mouthwash and hopefully get rid of this godawful taste. Just a reminder to take care of yourself if you're on the path to quitting, unnecessarily throwing yourself all-in too quick might be a recipe for relapse. Good luck to everyone struggling out there, it's going to be so worth it.

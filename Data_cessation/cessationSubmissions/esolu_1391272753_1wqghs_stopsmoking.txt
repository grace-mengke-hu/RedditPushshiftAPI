Taking my 6 months of savings to the hard rock for some fun!

Wish me luck!  My wife is so excited that we can stay in the non smoking area.  Honestly I'm looking forward to it too, even as a smoker it was a lot of smoke to handle.

EDIT: For those that don't know, the hard rock is a casino.  Looking for winner winner chicken dinner kinda luck :P

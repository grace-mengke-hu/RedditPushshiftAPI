Feeling like a failure

The past 3 weeks I have fallen back into smoking. It started out when I was drinking and thought, well 1 won't hurt. Then a few days later another one, then bam, buying a pack. Now I have been smoking half a pack a day again and it's making me feel like shit. By the time it's night time I go to bed thinking, I don't need these and what the fuck is wrong with me.

I just had my first cig of the day after being up for a few hours and after a couple of puffs I realized that this is lame. It literally isn't doing me a single bit of good and the only pleasure I'm getting out of it is feeding an addiction.

This may just be a rant but it feels good typing it out. I really need to just break the cigs in the pack I bought last night but I feel like I don't have the balls to do it. A few hours from now I'll be tempted to smoke another cig and if I don't have them available I'm sure I'll try bumming from a roommate and inevitably buying a pack.

I was on a roll and now I feel like a pussy.

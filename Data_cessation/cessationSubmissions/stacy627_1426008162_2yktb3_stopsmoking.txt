Ready to quit...but anxious and afraid?

I've been smoking since I was 18 (I'm 26 now). Started off with a few, to a 1/2 pack, now I'm at about a pack or less a day. I've been ready for a long time to quit- for my boyfriend, my parents, but mostly for myself. I suffer from anxiety (ironically) since around the same time I started smoking. I have the worst health anxiety and most of my symptoms can be attributed to nicotine addiction. 

I am so scared. I have my book (Allen carr) ready to go- plan on quitting this Friday...I have the weekend off & my boyfriend will be in DC so I'll be alone, with no plans. I'm afraid I'll fail. I've never tried to quit before, so I am not discouraged yet and have no reason to believe I can't do this. But I'm scared- what if I DO fail? Then I'll for sure believe I'll be a smoker forever.

I have been researching everything about quitting- tips, stories, symptoms, etc. and for every one thing I read encouraging I'll read something that puts me down and turns me off from quitting. 

 I don't know how to cope. I have a prescription for Ativan (taken as needed) will this help me during my first few days? Is it really that hard? I hear some people are so motivated and excited and happy and other people (not on Reddit specifically) who say it was the worst few days of their lives. This is not what someone with daily anxiety wants to hear!!!

I'm in this alone- my boyfriend is encouraging but he won't be here for support this weekend. I live far from family and friends (and they don't understand what anxiety or quitting smoking entails). Is this the hardest thing I'll ever have to do? Is it all in my head? How did you cope with cravings? (Sleep, read, eat??) and what tips do you have for dealing with withdrawal symptoms - especially worried about irritability, anxiety, and headaches.  please please help I need some real motivation and reassurance that I'll be okay !

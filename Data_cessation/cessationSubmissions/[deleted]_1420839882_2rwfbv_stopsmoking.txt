Quitting smoking is hypocritical

If I was addicted to crack or heroin, people would hug me non-stop while telling me how great I was for trying to quit, but that I should take it slowly and ease into it.

If I was an alcoholic, crowds of strangers would fall to their knees crying about how I was a *victim* of bad genes, and how the universe was to blame for making me drink.

As a smoker, if people could get away with spitting on me, they totally would. We're told to stop smoking! It will kill you! It causes every cancer imaginable, including the kinds that haven't been discovered yet, and ~~probably~~ definitely causes cancer in elephants and mantis shrimp!! 

Shooting 10 ounces of heroin while drinking 3 bottles of Rye per day is totally fine, but ONE CIGARETTE will result in instant cancer, renal failure, and fractured femurs. How? Who cares about the how, it's TOBACCO!

Ok rant over.

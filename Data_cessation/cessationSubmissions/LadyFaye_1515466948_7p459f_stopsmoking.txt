4th morning

Today was the 4th morning I have woken up and not smoked. I felt the need for the first time almost immediately after I opened my eyes. 

I have fought craving after craving today. 3 minutes my ass....

I am extremely hostile and cannot deal with anyone in my family. Every single one of them is irritating as hell. My toddler started crying about 30 minutes after she was put to bed and usually I can go settle her right down. Tonight she was having none of it. I just walked out. 

My husband can handle that shit right now because I JUST CANT. 

Even my phone making sounds makes me want to throw it across the room. When will this anger end? I am losing all the strength I have been focusing on not flipping out today.

If someone glances at me the wrong way I could potentially lose my fucking mind.

What a terrible feeling! I don't have anger management issues, so WTF is this?

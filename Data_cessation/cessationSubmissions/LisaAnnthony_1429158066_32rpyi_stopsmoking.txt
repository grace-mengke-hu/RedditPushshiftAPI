Tips on Quitting

Hey guys I am new to this subreddit and I have tried looking for a FAQ or wiki but I am not sure if there is one. Nevertheless, I am 18 and looking for some pointers and tips on quitting. I recently picked up smoking again due to stress and other things. I have been smoking for about 4 or 5 years and I just want to know where to start and how useful nicotine patches/gums are.
Sorry if there are other threads on this.

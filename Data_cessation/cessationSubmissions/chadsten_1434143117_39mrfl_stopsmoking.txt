700+ Days

I don't sub here anymore (too many triggers), but I wanted to drop by and hopefully encourage some people.

It's been tough. Life has gotten crazy, and I've had a few slips. I know, many people will think 'RESET YOUR BADGE YOU ARE STILL A SMOKER!' and that's totally fine.

I've had less than 1 pack of smokes in the past almost 2 years. I used to smoke 1-1.5 packs a day. I want this post to encourage those that have slipped and feel like they've failed. You **can** do it. Keep your head up, and remember that a slip doesn't mean you have to stop, or that you are a failure.

Good luck to those that are just starting, and congrats to those that have went far longer than I have with a literal 0.

Got a headache from withdrawal?

Well, you have had a headache at other times when you've had plenty of nicotine in your system.  This is one of the ploys the addiction uses:  blame the malady on the withdrawal from the poison.  It's insidious.  But it's really easy to quit, with the right mindset.  Got to watch out for this kind of trap though.

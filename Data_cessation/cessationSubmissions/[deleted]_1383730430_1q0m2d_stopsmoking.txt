Day 6 problems

So this is my 6th day, and no day has been as hard as this one. I woke up, instantly craved a cigarette. One of the most intense cravings that I've had so far. And all I can think about today is smoking. I can seriously feel a bit of a relapse coming on here. Up until now it was fairly easy. I don't understand. Surely the cravings would get less intense as time goes on?

Anyone got any advice?

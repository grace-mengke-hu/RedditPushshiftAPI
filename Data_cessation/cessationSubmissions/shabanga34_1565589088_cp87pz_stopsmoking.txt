What is up with my nose? Do allergies get worse after quitting?

Been having horrible sinus headaches and face pain since a few months before my quit (one of the reasons I quit actually). Now itâ€™s been 1 month and 9 days and my sinus stuff has become a nightmare. I take allergy medicine (Zyrtec and Flonase) and it takes the edge off but I can still feel the pain. Is this serious? Will this go away? Lol I feel so retarded right now.

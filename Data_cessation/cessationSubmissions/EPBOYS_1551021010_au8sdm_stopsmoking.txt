First serious attempt to stop.

I’m 22 y/o and first time writing a post hoping to get some strength from it.
I started smoking cigarettes for about ago 4 years. I smoke a pack per day~ (sometimes more).
I have a really addictive personality, been hooked on gambling, weed and gaming. I never liked tobacco but i smoked spliffs, my head was really a mess so i tried cigarette to let the weed go but it was the biggest mistake as I continued with both. Now i gave up on everything else (expect weed, i smoke sometimes with my friends when i’m in my home country but i’m okay with it because i now can controle it) but cigarettes...god i can’t get around it, all the time i have it in my head.
I just wanted to write it down and express myself a bit because i don’t like bothering my closest with my stupid addictions.
I smoked my last cigarette yesterday before sleep and my mood is shit right now, i can change in a split second from mad to feeling really down as i know from earlier attempts i’m gonna be like this, but i want it out of me for fucking once.

Cracked after 6 years

So after 6 years of not smoking I had a crazy night out at a house party and did some stuff I'm not happy with, one of those things was chain smoking loads of roll ups from midnight until 6:30 AM.

I always found the hardest part of quitting was dealing with the urge after lowered inhibitions, but honestly thought I had got past it after all this time. 

So now I not only feel run down from partying too hard, but my chest feel like crap and I am annoyed that I broke my non-smoking record. Oh well, I guess I have to take it as a lesson to remain vigilant even years after I quit.

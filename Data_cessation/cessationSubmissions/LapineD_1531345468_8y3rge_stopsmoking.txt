A week in and really struggling

I stopped smoking cigs and in the meanwhile used snus to make it easier. Now that I’m a week in I’ve noticed I’m using snus more often and craving a smoke really badly. I know I shouldn’t be using any nicotine at all but I wanted to do it in steps and cut out the cigs first.  I woke up today and was feeling really stressed out and went straight for the snus. I can handle not smoking, but now I’m hooked on snus. I know most of you are gonna tell me I just need to cold turkey but I really don’t think I’d be able to.

Thanks

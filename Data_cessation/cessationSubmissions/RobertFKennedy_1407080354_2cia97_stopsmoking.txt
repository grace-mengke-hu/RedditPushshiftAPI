I QUIT Yesterday

Hello. I need some support from the community. I am 32 years old, smoking a pack a day since I was 18. I've seen sick and tired of smoking, I hate it but have tried half heartedly to quit for the last 3 years.

Yesterday, I decided to quit for good. It has been 12 hours. I feel like everything in my life is dependent upon me quitting smoking. I can't properly hit the gym hard and on perfect schedule because I feel it is pointless to if I am still smoking. I feel it is pointless to eat properly if I am not hitting the gym right. I then feel it is pointless to take care of myself and look good (hair cut/shower) and so on and so forth.

I watched the Allen Carr method on youtube again yesterday and I feel semi confident I can quit.

How to fight my own subconscious?

The last time I tried quitting was 5/13/13. I did pretty well. I didn't really crave them much, I was able to resist the temptation to join co-workers while they were smoking, etc. It didn't help that it was a rough week financially, and I didn't want to scratch together $6 in change to buy cigarettes.

I even went 3 days after getting paid without smoking, but then I needed to get gas. The moment I got to the counter, my brain took over. Without thinking, or hesitation "Pack of camel menthols, put the change on pump 1". It didn't even register until I was walking back to my car. Once they were in my hand, I couldn't bring myself to throw them out.

It was a stupid decision, but I'm quitting again today and I'm wondering how to avoid situations like that.

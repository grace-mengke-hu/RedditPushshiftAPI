I don't know how to feel about quitting.

I love cigarettes. But I hate smelling like smoke.

I love cigarettes. But I hate my breath/mouth smelling/tasting like ass to other people.

I love cigarettes. But I hate how other people look down on me for smoking.

I love cigarettes. But I hate having to say the embarrassing phrase "I *have* to take a smoke break" or "I *need* a cigarette".

I love cigarettes. But I hate that my dad was a smoker for years and finally quit and now hates people that smoke, so I've been forced to hide it from him.

I love cigarette. But I hate the downsides to them.

Honestly I wouldn't even care about lung cancer or heart disease if they made cigarettes that didn't smell bad. I literally have "smoking clothes" which I wear at home when I am smoking, because I don't want my normal clothes to reek.

I'm currently a few days in after quitting. The cravings don't bother me, theyre there, but as long as I'm busy they aren't debilitating.

The problem is the idea that I'll never be able to enjoy a cigarette again. I feel too young to already be telling myself "ok well you can never smoke again or you'll just get hooked again". 

It's not the addiction that I'm going to miss. I love cigarettes. Nothing changed between me now and me 3 days ago that has changed that. Am I going to magically dislike cigarettes in a month and no longer reminisce about them? 3 months? a year?

I just feel as though I've found something I really enjoy in life, but am forced to give it up and never touch it again. If only it was possible to smoke in moderation... It honestly sucks that to quit smoking is to quit forever. I'll miss it.

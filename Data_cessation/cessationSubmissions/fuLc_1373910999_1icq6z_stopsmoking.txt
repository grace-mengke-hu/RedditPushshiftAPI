One year down, many to go. No sweat.

Feels great.  I owe it all to Allen Carr's book.  For the past 6+ months it's been pretty easy to resist starting up again.  I still occasionally have dreams that I'm a smoker and even in the dream I'll think to myself "this is wrong, I shouldn't smoke."  Then a big relief comes over me when I wake up realizing it was a dream.
Don't try to quit .. just quit.  Read the book.  Allow your brain to realize the truth about cigs.  You're not giving up ANYTHING.  You're gaining sooooooo much.

My dreams are so vivid.

Its quite terrifying because most of them are nightmarish and i have found myself waking up in the middle of the night several times a night.
Last night i dreamt I smoked which was a nightmare and when I woke up I had a sense of guilt.
I am awaiting a happy dream

On a lighter note, i am  proud to announce I am now coughing up brown speckled phlegm  as of yesterday. http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2bl2ir/no_phlegm/

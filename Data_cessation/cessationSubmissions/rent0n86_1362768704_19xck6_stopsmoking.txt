Sad but true, I still get cravings

I'me very proud of myself and quitting smoking 10 months ago was one of the best decisions in my life. 

However, it's kind of sad to realize that once in a while I still get rather strong cravings. I have no desire to smoke 99.9% of the time but sometimes, when shit happens, I'd really want one of those bitches.

Just needed to vent, hang in there you novices! 300 days feel great!

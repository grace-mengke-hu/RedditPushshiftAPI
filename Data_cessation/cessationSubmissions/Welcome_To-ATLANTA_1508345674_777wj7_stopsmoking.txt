Is chewing the gum everyday for the rest of my life a realistic alternative?

I can't quit cold turkey. I just don't have the will power and I fail every time. The closest I ever came to successfully "quitting" was with chewing the gum everyday. I went about 3 months or so without a smoke. However, I don't think I really came that close to actually kicking my addiction to nicotine. If I use the gum everyday, and therefore still use nicotine everyday, is it just a matter of time before I break down and go back or is literally chewing the gum for the rest of my life a realistic way to at least not smoke?

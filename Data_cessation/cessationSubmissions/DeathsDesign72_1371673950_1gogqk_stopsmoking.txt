Guess I better start here.

So, end of July wife and I are going to Portland, OR for vacation. (Visit my parents whom she hasn't me yet). We both decided that the cigarette before our flight out of Houston will be out last cigarette.  Quitting smoking the 1st day of your vacation, how smart is that?  Dunno, we shall see.  We have been wanting to quit for some time and figured if we were going to be on a plane for 4 hours and be in a city that isn't all that smoker friendly, it is a good a time as any to quit.  I am 40, wife is 56.  She quit once in her early twenties,  Started back again around 40 or so I think.  I started smoking when I joined the Navy at 17.  Quit 2006ish, for three months, quit cold turkey, no issues.  Started again when pregnant step-daughter moved in.   So new wife now, new life. and we both want to quit because we should, and we are foodies and are really looking forward to being able to taste the food like it supposed to be tasted.  I am going to let my wife know about this subreddit, not sure if she will make a username or not, she may just read the posts.   When I quit cold, to get past the initial cravings, when I wanted a smoke, I would just go for a walk, walk around the neighborhood for 15 min ro so and that took care of it.  After that I would always be chewing on a toothpick.  Don't want to go the toothpick route this time, was thinking of mini carrots maybe?  Any tips/advice would be appreciated.

Not sure if this is the right sub sorry if it isn’t, I’m 18 and have become very dependant and addicted to nicotine.

I don’t smoke cigarettes or chew tobacco however I use a thing called a breeze (small vape intended for high nicotine) and haven’t been able to quit ever since I got it. I tried throwing it away recently and ended up buying a new one after two days. I just couldn’t be bothered to quit which brings me to my first question do I really need to quit ? I know it isn’t good but does it really matter ?

I’d just like some people opinions on how much I should really focus about quitting and maybe some tips if anyone had a similar scenario to me. 
Please don’t just tell me shit like oh you never should have started vaping it’s only to quit smoking I understand that. I fucked up and should never have started using high nicotine juice but it’s a little late to just berate me ok being a stupid teen.
Thanks for any help or advice you guys can provide.

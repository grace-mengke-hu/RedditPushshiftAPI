I'm finally ready

I've tried quitting smoking before but I wasn't really ready and would go back to smoking after a few months. I kept saying I was going to quit and didn't really put forth effort.
Back in September I started using a vape and that helped kick the cigarettes. Over a week ago, I started mixing non-nicotine juice with my regular juice to help dilute it further. 
Of course, I went to see my family over the weekend, and they are all smokers. I usually end up caving in having a few smokes and I did this time too.
But it was different this time. Something just clicked in my head and I thought to myself that I was finally ready to quit. Monday comes round, and I only had one cigarette that I had bummed from a co-worker.
I haven't touch nicotine since. I know it's only been a few days, however I feel content and ready to stop.
It's time.

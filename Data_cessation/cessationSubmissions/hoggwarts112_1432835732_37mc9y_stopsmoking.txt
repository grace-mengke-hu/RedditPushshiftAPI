I became a non-smoker today!

Hello all!  Today I became a non-smoker.  I have tried 3 time in the past after smoking for 9 years. (I'm 26)  Part of the reason i was unsuccessful in the past, in the getting past the motion and habit of smoking.  Have tried hard candy, gum, and other things to no avail.  What has helped you guys get past that??

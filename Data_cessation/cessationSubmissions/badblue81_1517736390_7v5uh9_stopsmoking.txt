I'm disappointed in myself

10 years ago, I managed to quit smoking. It was hard, and it took me 3 or 4 attempts to quit. 

I had gotten a job in tech support, and as anyone that has worked a help desk line, it's stressful and this is why I starteded. I managed that stress for a few months before I bought my first smoke. It didn't help that the people I lived with smoked like chimneys... but I did it. Even after changing careers to a blue collar job in which every one smoked.  

Since then I've been smoke free, but this last job I've had has been terrible. A foreman that was green, and a poorly planned job  just piled on the stress, to the point that when a co-workerer invited me out for a smoke, I agreed. Because a single "dart" can't hurt. I mean I've been smoke free for so long, I should have the will power to resist the lure of nicotine. 

That one turned into 3 the next day, and then 2 the next. 

And now I have the cravings back again, and I've been fighting the cravings. Thankfully I have been able to control it mostly, but I've lost my will power. So instead of swinging by the drug store to buy a stop smoking aid, I bought a pack. 

And I can't really share this with my wife, since her job is even more stressful then mine and she looks to me for willpower to keep her from smoking again as well.  

But I know I need to tell her, because I need help with this. So help me /stopsmoking, because I don't think I can do this on my own.

A milestone

Today's my 100th day. I can't believe I've made it this far, but I have. 
It's harder now I think now that I know that ill never smoke. I think my body tolerated it for the first few days because it was just expecting me to cave. Now that it knows its freaking out. These next 100 days will be hard, but I'm going to try to stay focused. Lets hope this works.

Thanks guys.

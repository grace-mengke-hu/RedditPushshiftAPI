I need some anti-motivation to quit

I started smoking cigs socially at 15, daily at 16, and got to nearly a pack a day when I was 17. I got a juul right before my 18th bday, and have been using it, sometimes with cigs, since. I'm 19 and a half now. I've "tried to quit" many times, but I know deep down that I won't stop until I truly want to, and I just don't want to because I love the damn things and the feeling so so much.
I'm looking for some demotivation to smoke. I know I'm psychologically capable of quitting easily, but I don't bc the negative side effects don't feel real to me since the most known ones don't seem to affect me (A symptom of feeling like an "invincible teen.") I'm not completely out of shape since I walk my dog 5 times a day, walk to class, and workout, I don't get a cough, sore throats are rare, and my teeth are fine. Not gonna lie, I don't know how it's possible with 4 years of this shit under my belt, but it is. 
So tell me the worst side effects, stories, gruesome details about smoking that you know, please. I want the worst of the worst of things that could happen to me or that I could do because of nicotine as my final push to quit and never look back. Thanks in advance

Powered through a tough weekend!!

Just want  to share in a place where people will understand. I quit smoking at midnight on August 4/5 (lit up my last cigarette). The first week  or so SUCKED (as exampled by my whiney  posts on here, lol) but it has just gogten easier and easier with every day since then. Until Saturday. 

On Saturday, my boyfriend officiated  (?) his cousin's wedding. At the reception, we drank and partied with their friends/our friends and family. Damn near everybody smoked. My boyfriend and almost all of  our friends/family that we were hanging out with smoked the whole night. I'm talking large circles of people smoking all night long. In the 4.5 or so hours we spent at the reception, I would say we spent  3.5 hrs of it outside with smokers (boyfriend also smokes). It was so very, very, VERY hard not to give  in....but I didn't!!! I did find some relief however in using a nicotine free, essential oils vape pen shaped like a cig that the bride's wonderful brother loaned me, so I feel like I did use a crutch, but I FACED MY DEMONS AND STAYED SMOKE/NICOTINE FREE!!! Now I know I can do it the next  time  :)

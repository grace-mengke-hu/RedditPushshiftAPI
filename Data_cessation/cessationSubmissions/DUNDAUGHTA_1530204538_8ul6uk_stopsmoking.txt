6 days and I'm feeling sort of depressed

I am 6 days into never smoking again and I've been using a NRT and the smoke free app to help. It's been hard but great so far, I have seen the cravings go down and the days are easier now but I find myself a little depressed today. It really was a "companion" or something that I enjoyed doing. I enjoyed the time to myself, I enjoyed the "break from life" it sort of gave. I really did enjoy coming home, sitting on my porch looking out on the lake with a soda and playing a few games of chess on my phone while smoking 2-3 cigarettes.  I know it will pass and I'll be fine but any words of advice or stories you all have to share I could use.

So much change, I forgot what life without smoking is. It's been around 12 years since I first smoked.

Love you guys. is that weird? :)

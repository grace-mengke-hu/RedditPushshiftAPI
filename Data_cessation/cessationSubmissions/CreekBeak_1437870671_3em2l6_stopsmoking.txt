Over 50 days and food is weird

My wife still smokes.  I feel bad for her.  Just looking at an ashtray these days and I get a eww feeling.   Driving is so much more relaxing.  Do not have to worry about ashing, running out, wasting a cup holder on an ashtray.  all sorts of goodness.  
I have had a sore throat  and a headache for 2 weeks, think it is almost gone today.  That is either a real sickness or my body cleaning out.  Still get to smell things and taste things.  Pretty amazing.  Bananas don't taste right anymore though.  Ramble ramble.  Keep not smoking everyone!  What food did you have to drop when you quit smoking?

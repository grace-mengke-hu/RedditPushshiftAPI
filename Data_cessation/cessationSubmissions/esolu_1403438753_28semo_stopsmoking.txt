340 days and an active member of /r/stopmoking. I have come to reset my badge.

THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY A DREAM!!!  Man I haven't had one of those in a long time.  In my dream I consciously made the decision to come to this sub and reset my badge, and personally message a few here that have helped me tremendously that I have let them down.  I still feel the disgust in my gut.

I'm so happy to have felt that through a dream.  I've been on easy street for so long now, a reminder isn't a bad thing.

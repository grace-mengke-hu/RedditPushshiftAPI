I'm 17 and trying to quit smoking

I'm 17 and I am trying to quit smoking. I say trying because I want to stop, but I last smoked today at the afternoon, so I don't really know if I haven't smoking again only because I'm out of cigarettes.

I usually smoke during my shool breaks every 1h30 I have a 15 minutes break and go smoke. So I'm afraid tomorrow I'll give in. But I'll try not to.

I've known the dangers of smoking my whole life because my dad smokes and always told me not to. I don't know why I've started but I want to quit, not because I don't like smoking, which I do. I have no problems now (besides the costs). I want to stop because I'm worried about the effect it might have in my adult life.

I started smoking very young, but I've stopped a couple of times because I had never gotten addicted. And I always thought "Well, I can stop whenever I want". My dad smokes since he was 16 and never stopped. I've always thought about that in a "Yes but he kept smoking as an adult" way. And now I think to myself "If he never stopped since he was a kid, what makes me think I would, if not myself?".

So I want to stop.

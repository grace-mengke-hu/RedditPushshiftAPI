I almost forgot...today marks 4 years!

Just browsing reddit when it dawned on me...it's 4 years today!  I can't believe I almost forgot about it. That's how much smoking is no longer a part of who I am.

I used to think it was an integral part of me, that I would never be able to quit (for reference, I smoked 21 years of my life). I am soooo glad I read the Easy Way, which I found thanks to this sub and that I stuck to this wonderful community of people who were in the same boat, at different stages of their quit. 

If you are having a hard time, it's normal. Stick to it and it'll start progressively getting easier and easier each day. Do not underestimate the power and love in this community. Just thinking about it is bringing a tear to my eye!

Thank you for reading this far. I wish for you all to attain your objectives and to be the best version of yourselves you can be <3

P.S. 1462 days - WOW! :)

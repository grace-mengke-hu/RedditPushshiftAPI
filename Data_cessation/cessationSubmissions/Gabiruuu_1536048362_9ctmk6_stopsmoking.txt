2 years, 9 months, 20 days

2 years, 9 months and 20 days is the number of days that Iâ€™m smoke free.
I remember that 2 years, 9 months and 20 days ago I was not so sure that I would be able to quit smoking. For long time I smoked a pack a day. The times that I tried to quit, Iâ€™ve always failed. And I was pretty sure that I would fail again...
But 2 years, 9 months and 20 days ago, this reddit forum helped me a lot. I talked with people that was going through the same situation than me, with people that were 2 years, 9 months and 20 days ahead of me and advice me - and I always thought: I donâ€™t think I will be able to get there without thinking on cigarettes every single day.
So, I was coming here every single day.
I remember when I celebrated the first day without smoking.
3 days without smoking (happy and shaking because of nicotine cravings) 
1 week without smoking (it was huge, never done it before, nicotine cravings were even stronger) 
1 month came quite fast. I wanted to celebrate with a smoke but didnâ€™t. To proud to ruin it, 
3 months without smoking I was so excited for reaching it but always thinking on cigarettes. Bought a bike with cigarettes money.
6 months didnâ€™t care anymore about cigarettes and time started to fly. 
2 years, 9 months and 20 days, I forgot this forum existed but founded it today on the favorites of my browser. Went to check on my app how long has it passed, and 2 years, 9 months and 20 days!!!
I felt it was fair to come here to thank you for your support. It wouldnâ€™t be possible without you.
For those of you that are on day 1, keep going no matter what. Come here, write what is going on, people will help you as theyâ€™ve helped me. It is possible. I never thought it would be for me, but it is. For you as well it is possible. Youâ€™ll see if you keep trying. And without realizing, I hope to be able to read one day your post on 2 years, 9 months and 20 days. ðŸ˜‰

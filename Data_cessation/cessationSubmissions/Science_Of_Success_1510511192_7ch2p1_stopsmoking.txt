Did you read "The power of habit"? Was It Helpful?

Hey!
I'm new here, never smoked, but I recently read Charles Duhigg book The power of habit. It helped me change my life a lot, and I started making animated book summaries. 

I made one about [this book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHR5vheTDW0), with quitting smoking example. And then someone showed me this subreddit. Now I feel kind of bad because I never did my research well enough to find you guys in the first place. I wanted to show the video to my smoking friends, hoping to help them quit it ASAP.

I'm proud of you, as strong persons, and as a community! 

the question is, did this book helped someone quit smoking? The theory is great, but maybe you have a better book recommendation for habit management?

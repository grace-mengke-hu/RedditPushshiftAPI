I love this subreddit.

**There's a few reasons why:**

1. There is always someone to provide support when you need it.
2. No judgmental comments about the fact or amount that people smoke.
3. No stressful pressure to quit, especially no pressure to quit because of the negative health impact.
4. In line with 3. - unconditional support and helpful comments of why it is better to not smoke (e.g. breath easier, feel better, more active, smell and taste more) 
5. The badge: it keeps you on track, it's motivating and you will have milestones to look forward to and celebrate. When it was hard in the beginning, I'd pass by to check my progress. I'd say to myself: I don't want to start over.
6. Sharing the highs and lows of quitting: it's hard, yes, at least we know we're not alone. For me, it was the constant dreams about smoking, which looking back seem to be a fairly common withdrawal symptom. I've seen some comments about the phlegm (not the sexiest part about quitting), but great to know you're not dying and that it's your body cleaning itself. Thanks for that too, I didn't know before r/stopsmoking.
7. All the helpful tips about quitting: sharing about the e-cig, nicotine patches, gum, what to do with your hands, how to deal with drinking, coffee without smoking, it's all here. 
8. For providing hope. To everyone else who's tried once, twice, 100 times to quit and failed. You only have to succeed once, and thanks /r/stopsmoking  for taking that pressure and poor self belief away.

And for me, the most important one:

**For helping me quit.**

Thanks!

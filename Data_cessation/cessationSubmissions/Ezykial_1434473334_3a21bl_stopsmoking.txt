Dammed by just one smoke...

Here I was, nearly 200 days free from the little devils and I thought to myself "I can have one, even to just confirm they're gross, " and lo, I was right- it was distasteful and I thought that was the end of it. 

Fast forward a week and I'm having a moment of strength. Things are excellent in life, I want to celebrate and some sorry part of my brain thinks there's no better way to mark the occasion than a dart. 

Now I'm fully five weeks in to a new kind of torture, where every day I build up the momentum to quit and every day I break down and buy a pack... Or two or three (after having resolutely destroyed the remaining cigarettes in the previous pack). It's insanity I tell you! My morning self damns the consequences and my evening self vows to take those great steps forward. I feel like I've lost all trust in myself but I can't give up anyway. 

Today. June 16. Today will be the last day I smoke, and tomorrow I will return to confirm this- I'm hoping Internet shame and a tiny amount of accountability will help (you see, I only unquit secretly so I'm sleuthing all around) to reseal this deal. The 200 or so days I had were great, and I can clearly remember feeling how silly it was to be addicted to nicotine and loving all the gains... 

Thanks for your support team, wish me success! And tips if you have any

Edit: it begins! 10 pm, before bed hurdle.  

Edit2: break time overcome. Lunch break incoming, no smoking success so far! Physical cravings insignificant, mental cravings extreme lol.

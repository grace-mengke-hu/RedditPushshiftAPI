Looking for answers and support.

Hello everyone. I'm new here. I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking about a pack a day for just shy of 9 years. I'm currently on day 18 of no smoking, cold turkey. In the past I've tried cutting back, nicotine patches, and ecigs/vaporizers, but nothing has been as effective as cold turkey. 

Anyways, I write this because I just wanted to hear from some successful quitters out there about your struggle and how you overcame a lot of the physical withdrawals. 

I've had cravings, but those have been the least of my issues. I've been able to occupy my time with cleaning, working out, walking, etc. But as of a few days ago I have been getting flu like symptoms. I wrote it off to being sick, but every morning I feel fantastic then right around 10:30/11:00 I feel like I just got beaten down with a baseball bat. Then nauseau kicks in but I never vomit or anything else. These symptoms have stopped me from physically being able to do the tasks I've been doing to occupy my time when cravings sneak up, which is making this all much worse.

I don't mean to come here and complain, and I know I can read about some of these issues online, but like I said I just really need to hear from someone who's gone through this too. It's getting harder as each day goes by and I've got no one else who's quit smoking around me. Thanks for hearing me out.

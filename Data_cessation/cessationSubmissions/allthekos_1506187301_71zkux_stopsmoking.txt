Champix...

Hi guys,
 
I'm determined to stop smoking soon. 20 a day for 20 years...ive failed every time I've tried to quit. I've tried Allen Carr. I've tried ecig, I've tried nicotine replacement. 

I've avoided champix as I have mental health issues (generalized anxiety and bipolar) and read some horror stories about champix that put me off big style. But I've also heard a lot of people have quit with it.

Can anyone that's had it help me understand, what are the side effects like? Does it work?

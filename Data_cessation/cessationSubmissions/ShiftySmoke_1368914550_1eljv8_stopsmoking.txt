Day one.

So I've made the decision to quit smoking. Again.  
I read EasyWay and quit for 3 months last spring but relapsed and have been back to full-time, pack-a-day since then.    

My wife and I are expecting a baby girl in two weeks, so I need to get this shit dealt with. Now. No more putting it off.  
  
My father has smoked for my entire life and it's something I will always attach to his character. It defines him and for the last 12 years, it has defined me. I don't know want my children growing up with that image of me.    

I've been subbed to /r/stopsmoking for the last 6 months. Reading everyone's personal struggles with this wretched weed has been encouraging.   

  
Stay strong. I will too!

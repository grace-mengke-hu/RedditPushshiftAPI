Long time lurker, first time (attempted) quitter

Reddit fam, I want to quit chewing tobacco once and for all in 2019. You could call it my New Years resolution. I’ve been on and off dipping for many years, but I’ve made the determination to make this the end, once and for all.

My question for you all is this: what has helped you quit? What are some do’s and don’ts and watch outs? 

All of your input is much appreciated! Peace &amp; Love

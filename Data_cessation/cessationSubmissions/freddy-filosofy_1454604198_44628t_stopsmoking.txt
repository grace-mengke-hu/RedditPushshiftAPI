Failing in my attempts for 3 weeks now.

I am trying to quit for 3 weeks now. I feel I need a kinda "push start". Hence, I have been quitting on weekends as I do not smoke when I am with my family. I feel this makes it a lot easier. I relapse on Monday/Tuesday and then I do not have the strength to quit until the next weekend. Getting frustrating now. I feel this is, at some level, because I do not really want to quit.

My not smoking journey

I've only been smoking regularly since around 1 year, I'm not entirely sure how long it as become regular for me, at the beginning I was only smoking when I was drinking in company, it slowly changed to become a habit with about \~ half to a pack a day (10-20cig a day), now I want to stop smoking, I already have not smoked in the past 6 days but I definitely feel the cravings a lot.

My strategy so far involved:

* looking at youtube videos to motivate me, I found this one so far the most effective: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXRlHaWAms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXRlHaWAms) the women with throat cancer is definitely something to motivate, if anyone has similar videos I would appreciate.
* replacing the addiction with another: I started drinking alone I feel this helps me with replacing the cravings with something else, I drank in around 4 days of the past 6 around 28cl of 40% alcohol which if my math if correct is almost 100g of alcohol? Way too much damn, but my math might be off by a lot, it just seems like I drank almost half a bottle of scotch a day :(

I also want to try nicotine patches and as a last resort e-cigarettes with nicotine.

I mostly feel cravings in the evenings where drinking definitely "helped" but I'm not so sure it seems like replacing one addition with another potentially terrible one, and drinking makes me having terrible hangover while cigarettes didn't.

Anyhow I keep you posted on my progress, I feel like tomorrow is going to be challenging since I'm again surrounded with people who smoke in the office.

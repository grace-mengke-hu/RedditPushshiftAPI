A Great Reason to Quit- SEX

Hey all! As a celebration of my one month smoke free, I wanted to share a bit of information with you that not a lot of people (at least in the US) seem to know about, and that is the effect that cigarettes have on your sex life. Where I grew up, we had drug education before sex education in public school, so I believe that this effect was neglected because of that order. I have seen now that the warning labels on cigarettes packs in other countries include warnings about sexual viability, but of course the tobacco companies in the US would never allow those types of warnings on packs. Nobody ever told me that cigarettes would have some pretty severe effects on my sex life until I went to a doctor for erectile dysfunction and he told me that smoking was likely a large part of what was holding me back. Turns out, doctors know what they're talking about most of the time. Since I've quit, my sex drive has been bonkers compared to what it was, and basically everything to do with my sexual performance has improved in a noticeable way.  Same goes for ladies! Go out and read about it! Just another great reason to kick the habit, take it from me. 

TLDR: Quitting smokes improves just about everything related to sex. Sex drive, performance, satisfaction. Try it today!

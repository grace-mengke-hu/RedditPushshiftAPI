(F/28) lost desire to smoke after many tries due to pain in upper back

Yeah so turns out the terrifying idea of actually having cancer/ lung damage is way more powerful than the delusion that smoking is pleasurable. Every time I get the feeling/ craving like "oh I could have a cig" I just think urgh.... you could but why..... I need to go to docs....

Has been easy so far but no doubt the weekend will

Tomorrow is day 1

Tomorrow is my quit day.  I'm not sure how this is going to go.  I've been smoking a pack a day for over 21 years.  I'm only 35.  My GF quit two months ago when she got sick and she said the first few days were easy for her.  I have a hard time going just a few hours without a cigarette.  I'm going cold turkey mainly because I don't want to prolong the misery.  I know I am going to have a hard time with triggers because just about everything I have done for the last 21 years has had a cigarette built into it. Smoking after meals, drinking, playing games, I even have three cigarettes built into my trivia night.  i smoke when I drive, after sex, before bed, when I wake up, and oh so many more things.  I have no idea how to deal with all of that.

I also have anger issues, but only when I am not smoking.  I am a calm and easy going kind of person normally, but when I am in withdraw, I get angry without provocation.  

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

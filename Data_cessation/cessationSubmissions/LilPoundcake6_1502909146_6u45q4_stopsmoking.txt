First day.

Today I started my journey of quitting cold turkey. I've been a pack a day smoker for 5 solid years and have 'attempted' quitting multiple times in the past but I would always succumb to the voice in my head telling me that "just one won't hurt..." or thinking that bumming one off of a friend would make me feel less guilty. It never worked for me. I got to thinking the other day that I don't even enjoy smoking... it's just a habit. A bad, bad habit. I struggle from ADHD and have self-medicated with nicotine so I'm not so bored all the time. I'd smoke after meals, after receiving good/bad news, my morning coffee... I had a routine and a life built around my addiction to cigarettes. I decided last night that I would finish my pack and be done. So, I slept a good 8 hours to get a head start and now it is currently 1:40pm my time and I can say that I've had about 30 cravings or so today... so much that I've had to preoccupy myself to the max. I know in my heart and in my brain that I'm doing the best thing for myself but the destruction of my routine and habitual practices is so difficult on me. I've downloaded the Smoke Free app on my phone and made this Reddit account primarily for this subreddit. 

If anyone has any friendly advice, tips, or tricks, I'd be more than happy to hear them. 

Thanks for reading.

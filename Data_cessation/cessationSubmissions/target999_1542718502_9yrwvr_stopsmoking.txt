Help me with this moment !

This is my 5th day i haven't smoked a cigarette ,my mind is playing with me like hell , its trying to convince me how people survive 70+ years while smoking , its telling me to get that one fucking smoke and it won't make a lot of difference,  its making me feel how important my friends are with whomever i smoked &amp; i need to meet them right now !!. Its even making my body take those paths/roads where i used to smoke every day. Still trying my best to just not give a fuck about it. Most difficult time of my life.

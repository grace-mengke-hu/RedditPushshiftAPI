Struggling

Just having one of those weeks /months. I recently moved and I let the novelty of moving to.a new place seduce  me but I actually do not like the place or the city and find myself wishing I never moved in the first place. On top of that, work is being shitty again and smoking just seems so enticing because well I just don't like my current living  situation and I'm  stuck for a year. 

I don't even know how long it's been so I won't  ruin that  but man this just  sucks. My impulsivity fucks me and I never learn. Probably why I've had so many failed attempts at quitting! Haha

Anyway, that's  all. Don't smoke, folks

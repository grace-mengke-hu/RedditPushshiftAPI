Crossed the finished line into Day 3 of no smoking...

Day 2 was a lot harder than I expected in the sense that I craved a cigarette every god damn waking moment/a few moments where I was sleeping and dreaming of smoking.  And yeah... maybe I did scream cry... maybe... and now another 24 hour cycle begins.

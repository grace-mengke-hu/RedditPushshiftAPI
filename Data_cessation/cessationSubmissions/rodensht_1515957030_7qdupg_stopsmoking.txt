Worries

Hey everyone, well done on your progress! Just wandering if anyone had any bad physical withdrawal symptoms? Im a 19 year old male who hasnt had a cigarette for 24 hours (not that impressive, i know haha) but the left side of my chest around my heart is almost tingling, and sometimes im short of breath? Any info would be great!

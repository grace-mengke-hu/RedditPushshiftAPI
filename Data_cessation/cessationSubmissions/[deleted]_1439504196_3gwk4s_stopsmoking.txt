I think I need some help..

I've been trying and failing to quit smoking for months now. I know I have to do it, I know I'll feel a million times better. But for some reason, I'll go a few days without smoking and then completely sabotage myself. I'll end up right back where I started and begin the cycle all over again. I know that I'm being entirely illogical by forcing myself to keep going through withdrawal over and over and over again but I just can't seem to stop.

Another thing is after I've lapsed, my brain starts thinking I can keep pushing back quitting another day. So each night I prep myself for quitting the next morning and then I'm like, nah I'll just do it the next day. Over and over again. I hate myself for it and I know I sound like the biggest idiot right now. 


Is there anything someone can recommend? I know the times that I fail tend to be on my walk to work or on my walk home from work, I pass a lot of shops and tend to wander in. I'm trying to work out a way to stop myself from doing that. But I don't know, should I go see a doctor? My doctor doesn't offer a quit smoking service apparently, it seems like the services aren't great in my area. But I know that I 100% want to do this and I want my willpower to stay. I just need some guidance on how to break this cycle. Can anyone offer recommendations? A new way of thinking or ways they've stopped themselves from lapsing?

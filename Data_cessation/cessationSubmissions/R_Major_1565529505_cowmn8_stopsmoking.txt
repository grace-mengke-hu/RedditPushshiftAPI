I'm so happy about it!

I just needed to write this because I'm so-so thankful for myself.

Firstly, like we all, probably have tried to quit several times - me too! But it's totally okay to fail! The most important thing is to not stop trying. I decided to give up this nasty habit now 8 days ago and I couldn't be happier. I have tried to quit maybe 10-20 times for now, I don't know, but I smoked for almost 4 years.

Why I'm so happy at the moment, is because I went out yesterday, got really drunk and had like HUGE cravings. I was SO close, to ask a cig from my friends, but every time I had this thought I remembered how far I had come already and it would reset everything to the beginning. And I didn't smoke, not a single puff! 

So what worked for me? I found out, that writing down 1-3 habits that I want to stick with for at least one month and after that, I think it's easy to stick with those habits. Second thing what helps me is to consciously decide NOT to smoke every time I have cravings. Cravings usually pass in like 10-15 minutes, I can survive that...

I really have had very big cravings, but it's an accomplishment on its own to overcome these cravings. Every time you overcome a craving it's a victory over yourself and over this habit.

Stay strong, you can do it, you are stronger than that, do it for your own good! 

Peace

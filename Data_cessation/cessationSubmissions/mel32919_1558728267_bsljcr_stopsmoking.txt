Smoker for 15 years

New to Reddit. First post. 


I just recently quit smoking. I didn't plan to do it. It just kind of happened. For the past 3 plus years I have been what I would consider a light smoker. A pack usually lasts me a week to a week and a half. This past Sunday I got back from a week long vacation. I took one pack of cigarettes with me and I brought 6 cigarettes home. I smoked Saturday night at an event we were attending with some friends. Sunday was so busy packing up, checking out, and getting on the road. During the trip home I never stopped to have a cigarette (I don't smoke in my cars). Never really had the urge for one. Monday came along and same thing. Didn't have the urge to smoke. Tuesday I realized that ok you have not smoked for a couple of days. No use in starting back now. When I have craved a cigarette the past few days I grab a piece of bubble gum and that gets me past the craving. 

Well here is the reason I am here today. 

I am really really really craving a cigarette today. Since I have been several days without one I don't want to start back now. I am looking for support, guidance, advice, recommendations, all of the above as to how to handle this. Thank you in advance.

The past few days I have really wanted a cigarette. Still do. And I'm gaining weight. What gives?

I used Nicoderm CQ step 1 for the first 3 weeks and that worked pretty well. Since then I've been cold turkey. These last few days I have wanted to smoke really badly. It doesn't help that I've gained weight. I had to get new pants for a job interview because my old ones don't fit. I am bloated and it's my time of the month too but I still shouldn't be this fat. I guess the lesson there is don't keep a bunch of Halloween candy around when you are trying to quit. I guess it's black licorice next year. I hate that stuff. 

Everything is worse because I'm trying to quit smoking. I need to re-take a licensing exam to get a good job, can't afford do that until next month so right now I'm interviewing for crappy jobs. I wouldn't have had to buy new pants if I'd already gotten licensed and gotten a job because I'd be on my feet all day long, probably. I'm not even sure if I want to do that job anymore but we've planned around me making that income. I really hate myself and just want to smoke. At least one bad feeling would go away. But no, then I'd feel guilty about smoking again. I am tired of this.

What are your thoughts on ecigs?

I've spent a lot of time recently over at r/electronic_cigarettes, but I want to pose the question to you guys as a totally different quitting community.  I've spent a little money on set up a few weeks ago, and have absolutely loved it.

Once I had a set up I actually enjoyed, I completely stopped smoking regular cigarettes.  I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes in over two weeks.  I bummed one from a friend last week, and had to put it out less than half of the way through because it tasted so awful and just wasn't fulfilling.  

I've done the math, and now I'm spending less than $1/day on vaping (compared to the $9+/pack/day I was spending here in Seattle).  

I'm torn though; on the one hand, this is the longest I've gone since I started smoking 12 years ago.  I feel better (can breathe a lot easier), don't smell all the time, and am spending next to nothing on it.  I've tried the gum, the lozenges, and the patch in the past with no results.  

But on the other hand, I'm still doing nothing to kick the actual addiction to nicotine and we still don't know the long-term effects (although it HAS to be better than real cigarettes).

What are all of your thoughts on using eCigs as a way to quit real cigs?

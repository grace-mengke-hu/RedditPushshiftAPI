Starting to ween myself off.

So about a year ago I managed to quit smoking for roughly three months, I started up again for what's arguably the worst reason; boredom. Today I've decided to start quitting again, I'd regularly smoke a little over half a pack a day, mostly while at work. I've given myself a limit of 6 cigarettes today, and so far I've had 4 and a half. Tomorrow I try to keep it to 5 or less and lower my limit by one every other day (or every day if I feel I can do it) until I can stop outright.

Any additional advice is welcome, although this post is mostly meant as an official statement to myself of my intent to kick this habit. Wish me luck!

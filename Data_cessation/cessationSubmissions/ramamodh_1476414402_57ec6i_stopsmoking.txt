My experience so far and a question!

Hello good people of Stop smoking! 

I have been following this sub since October last year. It has been one of the most motivational subs i follow and has been instrumental in my successful quit. 

I had a failed attempt of ~40 days the first time i quit. It lasted from the 25th Dec 2015 to last week of January 2016.I attributed that failure to me taking to hookah regularly. 


I was thinking of quitting again for sometime and quit on the 4th of July. It's bee going great so far. I haven't smoked a single cigarette since. No hookah or nicotine except for a couple drags from a Cigar during Oktoberfest (I have been kicking me in the butt since then. It's like a thorn in my smooth quit so far.) 


I feel like all my urges have disappeared long back and I have also learnt to party/drink without smoking which used to be my Achilles heel when it comes to quitting. 


To everyone who is starting out, YES, it is very much possible and stay motivated. And I have a question to well established ex smokers. Should i look out for any specific urges/hurdles in the future?

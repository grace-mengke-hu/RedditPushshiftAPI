I don't know if this is a well known trick when using nicotine patches?

Where I live Nicotine patches cost $33 for a pack of 7. They come in 3 strengths, 21, 14 and 7 mgs. 

I quit smoking using them 3.5 years ago but recently stumbled for a few weeks but am now 2 weeks back in to quitting again using the patches again.

However, this time I started on the 14mg for one week. Then I bought a pack of 21mg but i cut them in half. So for my $33 I get 2 weeks of 10.5mg patches.
In a couple of weeks I will be going down to 7mg. Thats right, I will be cutting those 21mg patches into 3rds. 

By the time I am back to being nicotine free I will have only spent $100 on patches instead of $264.

Has anyone else tried this? It works perfectly.

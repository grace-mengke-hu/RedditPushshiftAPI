One week down. (Again)

I've been a habitual quitter for a long time. (My flare should be adjuated) 

Tired of the coughing, shortness of breath and the financial strain smoking has on me. 

Last week I went to buy a pack and the cashier said, "that'll be SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY TWO CENTS." 
I said no thanks and walked out.  Went to CVS and bought a week supply of 21mg patches.  This pat weekend my step mom, being happy I've taken steps to quit, goes and buys me a month of 21mg, two weeks of 14mg and two weeks of 7mg, enough to run the entire program of nicorette quit program.

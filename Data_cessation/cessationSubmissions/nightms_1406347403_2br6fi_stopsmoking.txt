'Friends'

Hi there! I'm new here.

So since I decided to quit smoking my biggest problem are my friends, because all are smokers and since the day that I quit smoking they call me 'faggot' (and other similar things) and I really don't care about it but it hurts the fact that they are not supporting me, they say that we are too young to stop smoking. I am 24 years old also they. 

How do you handle this kind of friends?

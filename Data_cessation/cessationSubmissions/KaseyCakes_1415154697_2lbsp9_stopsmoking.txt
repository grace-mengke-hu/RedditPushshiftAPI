OK, about 28 hours in, was feeling pretty OK till about an hour ago...

So, like I said 1:00ish yesterday (CST) was the last time I had a cigarette... Just in the last hour or so, I've felt like I NEED it. I don't feel like I've really had any physic symptoms, no headaches, no CRAZY frustration, I just crave it... And right now, I REALLY crave it. I want the burning, I want to sit down outside and relaxing for awhile... I was so excited that I hadn't struggled at this point (I'd tried twice before the first time 2 days the second time, maybe a day...) but right now, I'm about to go buy a pack... I'm lazy, so it'll probably actually be  awhile, but all of my reasons for quitting are complete vain, and I'm a little bit inebriated. FUCK, I just wanted to be done, but right now I'm not sure if I can...

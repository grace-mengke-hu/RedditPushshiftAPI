Stopped for 2 days: Feels like more!

Hi guys, first post here, but I'm wobbling so thought why not!

I've been a smoker since I was 16 (20 years ago: God, has it been that long???). Promised my wife and kid I would give up before my birthday - and have managed to give it up a bit later than advertised - the day after my birthday.

So far not been too bad, but now feeling shaky (literally) and could really do with a smoke. I know I don't really want it though.

Have tried (and failed) in the past after reading Allen Carr.

This time is cold turkey, and I AM GOING TO DO IT!!!!

More coffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

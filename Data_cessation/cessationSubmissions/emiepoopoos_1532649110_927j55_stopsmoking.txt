QUIT ZITS

My fucking face is erupting, my allergies are worse, I'm angry as fuck (but weirdly unapologetic about it). But the acne and flu-like symptoms? Combined? NO. 

Oh god in heaven with mary and the little lamb. I worked so hard to clear my skin up. It was looking so good. Now I'm embarrassed to leave the house and missing out on the lovely weather and friends don't understand why I'm not hanging with them. 

It's worth it. [Just not feeling great about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LGTEI1RMoQ)

TLDR: If someone could give me some solid info on quit zits or share their experience, that would be great. I don't mind waiting it out if that's the only thing I can do.

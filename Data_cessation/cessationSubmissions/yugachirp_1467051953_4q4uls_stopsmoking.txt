Day 2 After 6 Months of Increasingly Habitual Smoking

I began smoking at the beginning of the year when a friend left a pack of cigarettes in my car. I particularly enjoyed the menthol cigarettes he had left behind. Every now and again, I would buy a pack. What started as a pack every other week became three or four packs a week. 

I have grown rather fond of the habit, and I am currently struggling to keep away. Just looking for advice, or tips on staying clean!

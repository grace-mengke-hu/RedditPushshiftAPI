Thank you to this sub!

This sub has been great. It has helped during the hardest parts of my quit. It always keeps motivated when I come here.  I love the positive sharing and support. 

I am now 
=> 5 months and 9 days quit
=> 518 dollars saved! (Actually more since I used to bum cigs out a lot)
=> 1591 cigs not smoked

Yes! Never going back. Somedays I still have to deal with a brain that wants one at certain triggers, but I am not going back. 

Thank you everyone. 

Keep going!

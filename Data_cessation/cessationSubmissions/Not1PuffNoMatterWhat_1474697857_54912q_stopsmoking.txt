6 Months-Candidly Practical Advice

I stopped smoking exactly 6 months ago. I smoked 1+ packs a day for about 15 years. I wanted to share what always kind of made it ok in my head to smoke-all the bad things in your brain. For me, I'm from a very poor background, have struggled on and off with food insecurity, neurotic in so many stupid ways I can't count, gay, gender non-conforming, not much to look at, from a bit of a tragic family background, etc. etc. etc. Somehow these monsters in my life (the bad things-and we all have them, they're just different decks), made me think smoking was okay-like, why not? Thinking like "life's already pretty bad-making it worse shouldn't really matter that much/we're already on a crash course-at least smoking feels somehow satiating." It took me years and years, a lot of thinking and time to realize that smoking was a weird way for me to take an action I liked and feel empowered because I had a need (addiction) and I was satisfying it (by smoking). I also felt empowered doing something that communicated that  I didn't care about myself or my future. All in all, it's been a weird and hard 6 months, but knock on wood, I wouldn't give it up for the world. I wanted to write in case other people are out there in this situation-where smoking is some effed up way to act out your self-hatred or a way to dismiss social condemnation. Big tobacco targets communities like mine for the same package of reasons. Not giving them the satisfaction to kill me is the vindication in my mind for staying quit. Cigarettes are a such a head game. Good luck to everyone quitting, and thanks to everyone in this thread that has shared stories. The only way I made it through this 6 months is with this community on Reddit-I visit when I have cravings, and love to come here to give and receive hope that quitting is possible and optimism that a better life is achievable as a quitter.

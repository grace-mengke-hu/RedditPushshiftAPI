How can I remind myself how crappy smoking is BEFORE I take a smoke?

Every. Single. Time. I break a streak by smoking, it is always afterwards that I remember that it doesn't help with my anxiety and stress, but causes it; it stinks and makes it difficult to breath; I'm paying a corporation to kill myself. It all rushes back to me how pointless it all is and how deeply I want to stop. I don't have a smartphone so I can't use apps to help me cold turkey, but it's just getting annoying that I almost don't think about how bad smoking is until AFTER I've smoked, and I feel guilty and stupid about falling for the trick again... When I'm feeling nicotine withdrawal smoking doesn't become a drug addiction in my mind anymore, but rather the cherry on top for social occasions, the after-meal, after-drink thing. IT'S SO STUPID. FUCK I HATE THIS. AAAAARRGHHHHHHHJKSHFLKJSDH JKLSDF Everything Allen Carr says makes sense when I read it for the umpteenth time but I just forget everything he says, almost brainwashing myself to forget, until I've got the nicotine fix, and THEN I realise I've been duped again! It's so frustrating... I don't have control over myself :(

1 month free, never thought I would manage it!

I've been smoking for 7 years since I was 13. Last year I realised I don't want my death to be for something as worthless as tobacco, but found it near impossible to stop because my social life and love life has involved cigarettes for all of my adolescence. Anyway I got to university and found a boyfriend and friend group who don't smoke so thought this is my chance to break out of the shackles! 

I've had a few failed attempts, the previous lasted a month and every single day was a struggle. I couldn't see or smell other people's cigs without maddening cravings. This time, however, I've really lost that desire. When I drink it's still difficult, and I've had a couple of cheeky fags with my best friend who smokes over a bottle of wine but overall I'm done. I can no longer see myself buying tobacco again. What's the point? Too expensive! Too many cigarettes I'll trick myself into thinking I'm obliged to smoke. Too many worrisome nights spent considering all the ways in which my body is being poisoned by the day's smoking. 

If you're struggling with quitting, my advice is:

Have a crutch! NiQuitin nicotine mints are mine, I used them heavily in the first few weeks and now only when I go out drinking. They last for ages in your mouth and give a pleasant underlying taste of nicotine. I tried patches but they don't satisfy the immediate desire for a cigarette, you need something to actually put in your mouth to distract you from the act of smoking.


I also like to google all the horrific photos of people's diseased bodies caused by cigarettes. And distance yourself from smokers it's so difficult to quit when you're with friends who smoke. 

Good luck anyone who's thinking of joining me with the struggle, and keep going to anyone who's already here!

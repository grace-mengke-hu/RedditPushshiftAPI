35 days in: Morning wood and Stronger erections have returned

It''s not like I never woke up with an erection, but over the past 4 years I've noticed that there would be many mornings when I wouldn't wake up with the General saying hello. 

I quit 35 days ago, and jesus h. I wake up with a raging hard-on now every single morning for the past week. I also noticed that when having intercourse, my erection is stronger and can be sustained substantially stronger.....

I mean I know its only been 35 days, and this may be related to some other yet-to-be-identified reason, but my circulation (and sex life) have definitely improved.

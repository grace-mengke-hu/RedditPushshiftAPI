Question about NRT

Good morning fellow quitters, and happy Friday! I have a question about the patches.. 

I have been using the 2nd step 14MG patches since day one, right now I have mine off. There was no particular reason for this, I have it with me I just haven't put it on yet. I had this thought to see how long I could make it without the patch. Is it wise to do this? Should I just put it on? Either way I will not relapse, though my brain is giving me the thoughts I'm ignoring them. 

Your advise is appreciated, thank you!

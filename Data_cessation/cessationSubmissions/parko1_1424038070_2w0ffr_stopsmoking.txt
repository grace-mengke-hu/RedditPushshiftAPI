One Month

I have made the month mark and i am feeling fantastic. 
I have had many failed attempts, a couple even lasting about a year.
I am in my late 40's and have smoked most of my life. I hate the fact i was addicted and a servant to cigarettes for so long. This is the one attempt that will last forever.
This site has always helped, just reading the posts of people in a similar position has inspired me to stay strong.

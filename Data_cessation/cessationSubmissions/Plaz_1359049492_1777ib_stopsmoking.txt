I haven't smoked since NYE

24th day of no smokes... 14th day of no nicotine at all.  30+ year, pack-a-day Marlboro red smoker.

Started the quit with lozenges, but got impatient and just wanted to be free of nicotine altogether.  

That's historically where I've failed... but this time I managed to maintain escape velocity!

Now just a matter of making sure I don't light up my lying motherfucker of a limbic system with even a little bit of fake "aaah" from nicotine.  

I now know just the tiniest puff will overcome my intellect and start the whole shitshow rolling again.  Not going to let it happen this time!

Hitting a wound repeatedly with a novocaine-tipped hammer is no way to heal it!

Going to make it stick this time, damnit.

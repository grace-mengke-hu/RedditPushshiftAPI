It's my first time quitting for real... It's been 3 days and my willpower is faltering. Help!

I've "quit" before, But this is the first time that I know I want to quit for real, forever.  My catalyst was my friend's (28/m) mother (52) dying from overwhelming cancer. She was a non-smoker who had all the money in the world for proper treatment... But she still couldn't beat her cancer. I DO NOT NEED TO BUY EXTRA TICKETS FOR THE CANCER LOTTERY. I plan on having kids and I will not put them through the pain of prematurely losing a mother to cancer. It's time for me to quit. I'm going cold-turkey on this... I've done the patch and the pill and e-cigs and I want nothing to do with them. If you all have any advice or helpful resources I would love your help.

Thank you!!!

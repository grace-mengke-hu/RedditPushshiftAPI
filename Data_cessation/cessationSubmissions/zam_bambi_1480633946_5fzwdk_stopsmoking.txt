Quit smoking 6 months ago but still using QuickMist

Hi all! So about six months ago I quit smoking. Was about a 15 a day smoker since I was 16 and I'm 21 now (super proud of myself!) I never thought I'd actually stop. 
The only downside is that I think I've found myself relying on the Nicorette Quick Mist. I stopped using it for a few months and after visiting my smoker friends I thought it was a better idea to use it again but now I feel so stuck. Was wondering if anyone else had the same experience and had advice? Thanks again.

Stopped smoking 3 weeks ago

I (F33) have always been the kind of person who really identified with my cigarettes. I was always really scared to quit so I'd never gave it a go. Till three weeks ago. One of my friends went to one of them workshops "how to quit smoking in 4 hours". I came along for fun and out of curiousity. 4 hours later we walked out and I didnt smoke again. This is great isnt it? Quite proud of myself as well, it feels surreal! I don't really long for cigarettes, I'm not bored. I'm just really really confused. It feels like everything happening is bigger then ever. Im so moody, upset and sad all the time.I just dont know how to control myself. Normally I'm a star in controlling myself, now I look for every thing just to be pissed off. It makes me sad cause I never am a negative person. Does anyone recognize this? I just want it to be done. Thanks for listening.

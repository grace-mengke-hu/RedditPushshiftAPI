First day

Today marks my first full day without a smoke in over 6 years. I'm really proud so far but I know it's not going to be easy. I made this Reddit account to mark the start of this journey. I was hoping I could get some good advice from anyone on here about how to keep smoking off my mind or any tips to help keep myself continuing down this path that I have chosen. Cheers!

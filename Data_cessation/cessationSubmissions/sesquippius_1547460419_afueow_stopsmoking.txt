I have been smoking for only 3 years... and i already hate it.

As the title says, I started getting into this popular addiction at 19 years. A little later than some of you here.

But after only 3 years of smoking, I am already fucking revolted by it.

Cigarettes... don't have any kind of palpable effects to return to, like alcohol. For me atleast when I smoke I get MORE anxious, than I already am :/. Smoking is such a sneaky addiction, you don't notice it until too late.

Fuck this !
I'm on my second day of smoke free, so I'm venting now.

No smoking after 4pm

Hi, new to the sub. I started smoking about 2 years ago as a joke, but the jokes on me ! Ha!

Now trying to quit. Mostly because I lost my job 4 months ago and I can't afford the expense of cigarettes any longer. I'm hoping once I get a job I'll stay busy and not think about smoking. 

So, for now, my plan is to stop smoking one hour earlier each week. This week I am at "no smoking after 4pm" and so far it's working! I did slip up a week ago and had one cig after my cutoff time but I didn't beat myself up about it and it was only the one time. 

Hope everyone else is doing well on their plan.

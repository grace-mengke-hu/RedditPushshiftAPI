60 Days today!

600 cigarettes not smoked and $280 not spent! 

Some of the things I thought would never happen...

* I kissed a girl that smoked and could taste the ash tray taste.

* I went through my entire morning routine without thinking about smoking. 

* I went through an entire **day** without thinking about smoking. 

* I was able to buy a plane ticket out of the blue with cash I had on hand. 

* Turned down countless cigarettes.

I still get the occasional craving, but it's more like a passing thought than anything. It's doesn't have nearly the effect it did when I started.

Anyways, I just needed something to celebrate, so thank you all for reading. Keep on keeping on, y'all.

60 days today...and it hasn't been easy

The cravings weren't the hard part, the hard part was the stress, anxiety and complete overhaul of my life when I quit. 

I didn't feel great after two weeks, or four, or even six, but today I've woken up and it's just a bit easier to breathe than it was the day before. It's raining outside and I don't need to go out every hour to smoke.

I tasted bacon and tomato for real for the first time in years this morning.

And the circulation in my hands has gotten so much better, no more tingling fingers.

Two months have seemed like a lifetime, but I finally feel like I'm getting back to a life worth living.

To all those just starting, keep it up! To all those who've succeeded, I'm on my way there!

Getting sore throat after almost 6 months of quitting

I am not sick, but for the last week my throat bothers me. It is not really sore, but it feels like there is a lump when I swallow saliva. I have been having strong urges and cravings for the last two weeks, so I don't know if its my body asking for cigarettes.

Just got my prescription for Chantix! Tips and tricks welcomed!

Hi all! I’ve been a smoker for 10 years, I’ve tried the patches and cold turkey, I didn’t do well on either. I’m trying chantix, starting in the morning. I’ve heard there’s side effects that can be pretty rough but I’m willing to power through. Any tips or tricks with this medication? 
Thanks!

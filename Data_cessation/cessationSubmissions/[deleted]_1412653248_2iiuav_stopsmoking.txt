The beginning

Hello all,
I've been a smoker for about 5 years and I've never been able to quit for more than about a month. I've found my success comes when I have support so I've come here. I'm ready to stop! My first full day starts tomorrow.

Congratulations to all those here who've made it past day 1 and well beyond.

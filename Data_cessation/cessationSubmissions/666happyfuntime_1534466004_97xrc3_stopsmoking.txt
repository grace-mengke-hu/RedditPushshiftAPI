5 days in and drunk

Havnt caved yet and feel good, just grabbed drinks after work, minimal urges, now I'm following the booze to see a friend I haven't seen in a while at another bar. Half worried to do shots and fuck it up, half excited to take the high ground and not smoke. IDK guys new territory and first real test since this attempt.   
This is my first real attempt since over a year ago when I held out over a month. Those are my 2 real tries in the last 5 years at least

Hooray Im a star

I just want to share my success.  
1 month down. 1 year is my next goal insight and then will work my way to forever.  
  
Some words from me:  
Quitting is very easy, I've done it so many times before. Then I realized I've been doing it everyday, after a cigarette I stop smoking for a few minutes to a couple of hours. Especially when we sleep, we dont smoke for at least 4-8 hours.  
  
Not smoking is easy.  
Doing it everyday is hard.  
But I managed to make it to a month.  
Cheers :)

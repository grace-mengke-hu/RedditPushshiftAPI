"I'm putting you as a non-smoker then!" -my doc

i had my annual physical yesterday, and my doctor was even more excited than me that i'd quit. i showed her the Smoke Free app & blathered on about how important this subreddit was / is, every day. 

she was so excited to move my patient status from "smoker" to "non-smoker" that i got goosebumps. it was my first moment where i viscerally experienced... idk, i guess feeling proud about it all so far. and relief. 

thank you to everyone here. i'm at 57 days, and feeling good. i didn't believe it at first, but it really does get easier. hang in there.

Almost failed so close to 1 year

Was driving in my friends car when they lit up and automatically passed me a cig. I took it without thinking and started smoking. It felt natural, wasn't harsh, was just as good as I had always remembered it. At one point I'm blowing smoke out the window when the thought popped into my head, "This is what I missed the most, exhaling smoke and watching it form a cloud then slowly disappear". 

That's when it hit me- I don't smoke anymore! What am I doing? I threw it out the window but the damage was done. I had just fucked up my tally- I'm so close to my one year mark and I just fucked it up without even realizing it. The instinct took over and I smoked without a second thought. I was so disappointed with myself. Ready to start crying, overloaded with shame.

And then I woke up.

I don't think I've ever been more relieved to wake up and realize that it was all just a dream and none of it happened. I didn't take a smoke without a second thought. I didn't ruin something that I am SO proud of. Thank god. 

I'm can't believe that I'm so far out from cigs (I mean I really barely think about them at this point) yet I can still have a dream where it all feels so right and can shake me up. Freaking crazy!

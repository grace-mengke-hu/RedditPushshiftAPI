advice on withdrawal driven anger

so I've recently half-quit smoking, i smoked a pack a day and for the last 6 days i have been making myself subdue to 3 cigarettes a day... as a result i have often moments where i randomly SNAP and want to rip everyone around me's heads off. i'll yell at people for zero reason and not feel bad at all until i smoke one of my cigarettes. i'm sure this is very common, so any advice to help a guy out from becoming homicidal... lol

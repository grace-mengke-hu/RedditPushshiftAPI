I'm on day 2. I quit to enlist in the Marine Corps. I can do this!

So I'm enlisting in the Marine Corps. I've been knowing the day would come where I have to quit. I started smoking 7 years ago when I was 16. At age 18 I was smoking a pack and a half a day and have been since. I am 23 years old. I quit Saturday night. I find that I am pacing around alot in the kitchen, getting these crazy bursts of like, frustrated energy? I don't know how to explain it. Sometimes I feel like ripping my hair out, but I know I can do this. Anyway, I have been running to practice and train for boot camp and I know I am stronger that this stupid addiction. I refuse to let some substance control me. This is a great subreddit. Thanks to everyone who has helped motivate me and given me strength. It is nice to know I am not alone.

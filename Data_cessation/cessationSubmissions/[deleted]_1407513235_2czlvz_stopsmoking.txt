I feel like I need something to put in my lungs I miss the smoke.

Day 2 attempt #20something. 

My first time using patches. They were free so why not. Anyways I miss the smoke and I have this overwhelming need to put something in my lungs. I'm tempted to buy an inhaler just for the hand to mouth habbit/ cold air in my lungs. Is there some type of healthy or maybe not unhealthy replacement that I can inhale?

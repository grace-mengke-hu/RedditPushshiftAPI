Day 1

Hey guys,

I never posted in here before, but I really need to know.  It's been a few hours since my last cigarette, and I really don't want to smoke another.  But I also totally do.  You know how it is.  I've had some successful quit periods in the past but then I get back in the habit.

I'm going to Iceland in less than a month.  I don't want to be craving a smoke the whole plane ride.  I don't want to be totally wheezing when I'm hiking on glaciers.  I don't want to be thinking of how to duck out for a smoke when I should be enjoying the experience.  So I'm posting here.  

Haaaalp.

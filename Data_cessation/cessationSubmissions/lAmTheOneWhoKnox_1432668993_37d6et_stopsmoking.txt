Can someone please help!

I've been smoking for a year and 8 months now. I REALLY want to quit but every time I do I get the urge to go buy another pack and I end up doing it. The most I ended up stopping for was a week and then I choked and went right back to the start. 
My father smoked for 30 years, my uncle for 15, and all of my cousins and friends  smoke as well and I spend a lot of time with them all so that doesn't help. 
I'm scared to go cold turkey because my oldest cousin did and he became extremely sick in the process. 
Can someone please give me some advice to help me out! I really want to quit as soon as possible! 

Any advice is appreciated!

Finally made it 5 days smoke free after 5 years!

Now I know this sub gets enough Alan Carr love. But it truly did work for me. I had been a smoker for the past 5 years. 20 a day normally and a pack and a half on my peak days. I just stopped over night, and like Alan says you actually do enjoy stopping and the withdrawal period which is so weird.  I had tried so many methods including inhalers, gum, patches, willpower nothing worked.
I know it's been only 5 days but I can genuinely say that I will never smoke again.
Food tastes better, smells are coming back and I'm breather so much better plus my mouth doesn't feel an ash tray all the time. I know I've done a lot of damage to my lungs so that will take some time to heal. It feels so good to be a non smoker! Anyway I just wanted to thank this subreddit. I have been a lurker for a while and /r/stopsmoking introduced me to Alan Carr's book. So thank you r/stopsmoking you guys have been amazing! 

I am now referring the book to all my friends.

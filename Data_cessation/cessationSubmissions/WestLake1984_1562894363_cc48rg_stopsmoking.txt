56 days/2 months as a non-smoker!

Quit smoking after 10-15 a day for 15 years.

I've mentioned some of the benefits I've discovered so far but another major benefit that I've noticed is increased strength and stamina; I've always been physically active and into weight lifting/bodybuilding but since I quit the poison sticks I've smashed all of my personal bests. Also gained 10 lb (in lean mass) since quitting and at the same time knocked +3 minutes off my 5 km time trial run! Not gonna lie though it's not all sunshine; the cravings still happen every now and then but now they're few and far between and even then more of a dull ache as opposed to the sharp sting during the first few days/weeks.

Thank you so much once again for your support guys and wishing the best to all of you!

One Week! 

Very, very happy with myself! 

One thing I've noticed that I wasn't expecting: my skin is SO MUCH BETTER! After just a week, my face is much less blotchy and sallow. It's less oily, and I don't always look like I just got out of bed. Just more motivation to never pick the shit up again!

Having a hard time staying disciplined/motivated with this.

I don't want to smoke. I'm not a weak willed person generally. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time giving cigarettes up completely. I have cut back dramatically but I am having a really hard time just going without. 

I read Allen Carr's Easy Way and it was great. By the end of it I was pretty confident I was done. Then a couple of hours later my spouse lights up and I just fizzle out before I even really try quit. 

I'm having a lot of anxiety right now because of things going on in life, but there's always something. It's never a convenient time to quit but always the best time.

I stay on top of myself in every other area. I eat well, I don't procrastinate much anymore, I exercise, read to/spend time enjoying my kids and teaching them. I do pretty much what I set out to do on the day to day. 

What helped you get there? It's starting to make me feel like a shitty parent. I don't smoke around my kids but they are aware that I smoke. I don't want to be a bad example and I don't want to be sickly when I'm older. I have a ton of great reasons to quit. I just don't know what I need to do to discipline myself here. 

Was there anything sort of out of the norm that helped you stay in the right mindset?

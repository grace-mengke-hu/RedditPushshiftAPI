Overcame my biggest triggers.

Went to my buddies house party. Got drunk had a cig in my hand but I didn't smoke it and just left before I gave in. Can't take that intense of a social situation without smoking just yet. So, leaving was my only option.  Also, I've taken adderall and drank coffee with out smoking which I thought would be harder but I did it no problem.  My roomate tried quitting with me but he gave up because of adderall.  On my own now. The gym is all that keeps me sane.

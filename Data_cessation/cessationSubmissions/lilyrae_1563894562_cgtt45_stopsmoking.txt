Quit date: August 1st.

Fiancee (36M) and I (28F) are going to be quitters!! He had already quit but started again when we began dating almost 2 years ago. I have never quit in the 13 years I've been smoking. I tried back in 2014 but was cheating with Black &amp; Milds. So, I can't even count it as an attempt. 

Both my parents smoke, as well as my first stepmom. My sisters smoke. My nephew smokes. My mom is 63 and has COPD. She still buys 2 packs a day and will even light up right after she uses her nebulizer. She can't even weed the flower beds without running out of breath. I am terrified that I will have to watch her wither away, gasping for breath, because she couldn't quit. I don't want my fiancee or his child to witness me doing that in 40 years. No way. 

He proposed in May. We're going to buy his grandfather's house in August and we want to be nonsmokers by the time we move in. I went to the doctor yesterday and got a prescription for Wellbutrin and patches. We have set our quit date. It's going to be a lot harder for me than him because he works in an office and I deliver flowers. My boss smokes in the shop (and he shouldn't) and he lets me smoke in the van as I deliver. It's such a habit for me to light up when I get behind the wheel. Because of my mindless drive-smoking I go through almost 2 packs a day. I can't keep doing this. 

I am hoping to be a regular poster here. I appreciate all of the encouraging posts I've seen so far. Can someone tell me the name of the app in everyone's posts? It looks like it is helpful and I would like to have it when I'm ready. Thanks so much for reading this. Here's to being quitters!

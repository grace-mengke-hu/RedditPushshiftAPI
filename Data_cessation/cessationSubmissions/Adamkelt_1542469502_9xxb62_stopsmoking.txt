[Day 5] Taking my life back

6 months ago, 46 years old, smoking since 19, I celebrated 2 years clean of tobacco.  I was hiking and running a few half marathons a year.  In June my life exploded (not getting into it here), and I backslid - HARD.  I stopped eating well, started smoking again, stopped exercising.

On Tuesday, I decided enough is enough.  I’m too old for this shit.  I got some patches (what worked for me two years ago) and stopped smoking.  Today I went on my first run since May.  I used to run 13 miles like it was no big thing - today I sputtered and coughed through a single mile. 

It felt soooo good.  I’m wiped, my legs are jelly and I’m hacking but I DID it!  Each cough feels like spitting a little bit of the monster out.

I’m taking my life back, goddammit!  Stay strong everyone.

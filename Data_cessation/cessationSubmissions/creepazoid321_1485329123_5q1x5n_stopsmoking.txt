One week down!

I went to the dentist and she said I had especially stubborn nicotine stains. After the dentist I smoked and thought "what the hell am I doing"?!? So I quit the next day using the Alan Carr method. I've set some mini goals to help me along the way. 

1. One day of work without smoking after stress
2. Not smoking when having a drink with friends
3. Getting a bigger badge
4. Being able to show my dentist no nicotine stains on my teeth

Did the first two and pretty happy about that. Breath is smelling fresher and feeling a bit better after cardio. I'm trying not getting too cocky and getting inspiration from you all :)

Just had my last cigarette! Giving it another go!

I'm giving quitting another shot. About a year and half ago I managed 7 months smoke free and it was amazing. I'm really looking forward to getting back to how I felt then.

I've got a quit-buddy, my friend and I are both quitting tonight and will be supporting each other via SMS over the course of the first week. We've planned a celebratory meal for the end of our first week, too, so it's something to look forward to, and I think it'll help to be accountable to someone.

Anyway, thanks for being here! It's great to know that I'm not alone going through this, and last time having people to talk to really helped.

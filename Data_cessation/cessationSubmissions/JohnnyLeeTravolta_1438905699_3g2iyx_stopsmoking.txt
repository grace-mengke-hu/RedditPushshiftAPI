Please quit smoking

Here is my story. I have to get it out. 

I have never been a smoker. 16 months ago my family gathered in a hospital room and watched my father breath like a fish out of water. Gasping for air, panicking, then passing out. This went on for hours his last day. We all watched and waited. Then he passed from lung cancer. He smoked every day of his adult life until the end. 

My step mother had been fighting lung cancer as well. Her chemo went well and her tumor was shrinking. Two weeks ago today, she awoke in the night coughing up blood. She went to the bathroom, and coughed up tons of blood. Then struggled to dial 911 but was too panicked. She went to the house next door for help but could not wake them. She died there, alone in the middle of the night on a neighbors porch. Coughing up pint after pint of blood. So much so that the police though it could have been a murder. It seems her shrinking tumor ruptured somehow and she was drown on her own blood.
  The family gathered at her home a few hours after she was discovered by the neighbors. When the mailman dropped off the mail. We got a fantastic red marlboro envelope. It contained a fold out pic of the marlboro man, and coupons for some smokes. 
FUCK YOU MARLBORO MAN! FUCK YOU! 

Please quit smoking. Cancer is a fucked way to go. Dont put your family through this.

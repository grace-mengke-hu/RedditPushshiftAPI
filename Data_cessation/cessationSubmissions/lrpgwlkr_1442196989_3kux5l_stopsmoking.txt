How often do you get sick?

I've been a smoker for 6+ years and have attempted to quit maybe 2-3 times without success. I get acute bronchitis every 2-3 months and it is horrible. A hacking, painful cough that just won't stop no matter what plus it's impossible to sleep. I'm so over being sick that I decided to quit this weekend, and it's been relatively easy to get over cravings because of my sore throat. Has anyone else experienced being this sick all the time from smoking?

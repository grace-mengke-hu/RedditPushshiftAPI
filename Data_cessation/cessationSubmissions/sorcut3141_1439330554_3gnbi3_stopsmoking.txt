Hello, day 8

Hi everyone.

I've had much success with /r/stopdrinking--458 days now! I got bronchitis as a result of smoking for hopefully the last time on the 3rd and stopped on the 4th. 8 days later, still super irritable, but doing just fine other than that.

Hoping having this sub as a reminder, plus my phone app, will keep me mindful everyday and I can kick this for good.

I've read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Drinking and found it brilliant. I've picked up Easy Way to Stop Smoking and will read it through soon.

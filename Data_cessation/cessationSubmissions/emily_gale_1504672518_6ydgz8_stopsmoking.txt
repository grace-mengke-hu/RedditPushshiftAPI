Missed checking in at the month mark, but here I am.

53 days in, and I honestly feel SO proud. If you're a week in, 12 hours in, even 3 minutes in -- DON'T GIVE UP. I promise, you CAN be a non-smoker!

The reason I came back tonight is because I've had my first "smoking" dream,..I expected it at maybe week one, but not now. It was honestly horrifying; I woke up completely convinced I'd smoked, even felt as if I smelled it. I felt so ashamed and overwhelmed, and it's only just hitting me it was only a dream. It's truthfully not on my mind on a day to day basis as something I crave or miss, and I've only associated my quit with positive behaviors. 

I'd love to hear from some folks with details about if/when they had "cig dreams". Was yours super vivid?

What is this sub's opinion on ecigs?

After numerous attempts to quit, I never made it more than a week. After I got a vape, my smoking dropped that day from 20 a day to 1 a day. I ran out of cigarettes two days ago and haven't even felt like going to buy any, so I just won't. Easy as that. I understand I'm still addicted to nicotine, but these things are clean, and any study trying to find a health problem with them have been 1) blatantly biased against them and 2) not actually found anything. It's amazing how after a month of being cut down, and now being completely quit, how much easier I can breathe! I just have to say, I completely recommend getting one. Just make sure you get a good vape, not one that looks like a cigarette. Cheers! =)

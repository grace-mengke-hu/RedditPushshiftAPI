One Month!

First off, this is my first time posting to this sub. Today marks one full month of no smoking. I'm proud of myself for making it so far! I never thought I could actually quit smoking. I tried numerous times before, but this time it's sticking. Many thanks go out to this sub and all the words of encouragement I've seen, as well as the counter flair!

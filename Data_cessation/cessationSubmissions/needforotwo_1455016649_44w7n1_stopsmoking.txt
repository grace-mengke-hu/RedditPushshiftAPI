Trying to quit. Need help?

I picked up smoking because of my FwB. He has been at it for 7 years, and although he tells me he's trying to reduce, and most days he does follow a routine of 2 a day as opposed to a pack, but that's not the point. 

I have been smoking 3-4 a day, even more, since about a rough 2-3 months now. This is taking toll on my health, I can feel it with general breathing issues, and a weird knotty feeling in my chest. I don't want this to be thing. 

General background: Almost everyone at my workplace smokes, so there are multiple rounds of coffee-conversations-cigarettes everyday, and that is what generally breaks me down and tempts me to pick one.

Any tips would be appreciated. I really want to break this, before developing some scary health complications. I feel really guilty almost all the time about this now. Need some really, really good motivation to go all the way, even when I have people around me smoking most of the time. How do I go about it? Also, would appreciate any pointers regarding reducing healthy risks, if any. Sorry if I sound pathetic. I really do want to quit.

Smoking relapse after 10 months smoke free

So I’m in my mid 30s and I was smoking since I was 17. Been quitting on and off for the last 2 years when I decided one new year that I’ve had enough. 

I’ve successfully been able to quit for 10 months when something really serious happened in my life. 

I came back to smoking about 2 weeks after my longest quit. Then I was able to quit again for a month. 

Now it’s on and off again. Been smoking for one month straight and I really want to quit again. I need help. 

Need advice.  Thanks

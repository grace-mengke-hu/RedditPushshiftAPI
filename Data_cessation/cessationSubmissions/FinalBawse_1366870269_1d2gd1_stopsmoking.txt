Opinions on patches and gum?

They're so expensive. Are they worth the money? I'm trying my hardest to quit cold turkey, but I'd rather not piss everyone off around me. My fiancee walked in the door earlier and I automatically got pissed at him for no apparent reason. I've only been a day without smoking a cigarette. I wouldn't call today my "quitting day", either. I just had no cigarettes.
Is it easier to set a day, or is it better to be sporadic about it? And how do I not kill my fiancee?

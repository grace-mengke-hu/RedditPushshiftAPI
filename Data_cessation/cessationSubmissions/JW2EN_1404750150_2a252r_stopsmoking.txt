Help? I'm deteriorating.

Quitting hasn't been a problem really. The first few days were tough but now everything is a breeze. However, I just noticed that I'm starting to suck so much at things I were normally good at, sports, video games and even classes(I go home and forgot what I learnt the whole day). Has anyone been going through the same shit after quitting or am I just having a bad week? If it is because of quitting, what can I do to get my focus back? Cause I'm definitely not going back to smoking. Does caffeine help?

EDIT: Some tips on how to regain my focus, even for a little while, would be great!

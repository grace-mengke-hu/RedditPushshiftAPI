Day 4 of not smoking

I've heard a lot of stories about the first week being the worst week to stop smoking, half way in I feel pretty good. This vape that I bought was a good investment as I haven't had any cravings yet. Other than that cough you get when you stop smoking I think I am handlng this pretty well, this may be the last time I attempt quitting after 14 attempts.Feel free to give me any advice (:

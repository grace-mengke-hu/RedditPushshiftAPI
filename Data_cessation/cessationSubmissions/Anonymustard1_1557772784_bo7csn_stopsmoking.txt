What was your do X instead every time you want a smoke?

Go for a walk? Eat a donut? 10 pushups?

After like 6 hours I just sit there and cigs are all I can think about and I cave. I’ve been doing OK, a couple 3-4 day streaks in the past few weeks. I just give in cause life’s not going so good right now and it’s my cope.

The most awesome thing about this sub

While we all come here to find comfort and strength in quitting, the most amazing thing to me is HOW MANY people are realizing every day that smoking is not worth their time or health anymore. We’ve all been victims of cigarettes and the fact that we can all overcome addiction because we realize we deserve better moves me. Thank you to everyone in this sub for posting your highs and lows. I’ve been a nonsmoker for 61 days now and this sub reminds me of how huge that is. I think of smoking, yes, but not enough to be tempted to buy any or bum one. I didn’t know I had it in me, like most of us prior to making the big move. However all the strength and positivity here is like a mental vitamin. Good luck to everyone here on their journey. You can do this. And once you do, what can really stop you from achieving any great goal? Nothing!

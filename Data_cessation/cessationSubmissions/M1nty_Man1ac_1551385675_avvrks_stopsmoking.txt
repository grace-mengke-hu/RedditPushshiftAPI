Vivid dreams after quitting

So I've quit weed before after essentially abusing it for an extended time and that resulted in crazy vivid dreams like never before. But has anyone had this with cigarettes?

I'm exactly a month deep without Nicky and for the last 2 weeks my dreams have been incredibly realistic and seem to be very long. It's quite enjoyable most times as I'll almost get to a lucid dream state but sometimes I'll have a really messed up dream that'll leave me kinda shook for the day.

I was smoking for a few years, about 5 a day. I quit cold turkey on 1st Feb after slowly cutting down over January.

Anybody have this happen? I've never heard of smokes doing this, but it is well known with weed so maybe it's the same...

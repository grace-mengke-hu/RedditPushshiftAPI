Feeling so tired

Hello fellow quitters and supporters! I've currently crossed into the beginning of day 8, since about day 4-5 I feel so tired ALL the time. Let me say this first, I am literally getting the best and deepest sleep of my life at night time with no issues (minus the weird dreams on NRT therapy) I just wanted to know, is it normal to be totally groggy in the morning, and lethargic for most of the day? I just want my natural energy during the day back. Any advice, is welcomed!

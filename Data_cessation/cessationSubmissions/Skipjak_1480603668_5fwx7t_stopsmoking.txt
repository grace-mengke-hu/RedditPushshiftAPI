Five days smoke free so far

Hi everyone,

After smoking for 6 years, I decided to quit. I am simply sick of it. I'm getting out of shape, my skin is turning gray, I simply look unhealthy. 

I smoked my last cigarette saturday night. The first two days I used a vape with low nictotine juice in it to help me cope, but now I'm doing it cold turkey. To be honest, this is not as hard as I figured it would be. I try to focus on other things, and to suck on hard candy (Napol√©on ftw) whenever I get a craving, that really helps.

Yesterday was the hardest day so far, though. I was at my girlfriend's place and was very nervous, throwing various tantrums over stupid things. I was in a very aggressive mood. 
We then visited some friends of her, who were smoking inside, that was quite hard to deal with, but I managed.
Going to bed was also dramatic. I was very uneasy, and felt unable to sleep. After I eventually fell asleep, I woke up in sweat a couple of times per hour. Had some very odd dreams as well.

Today I feel much better though. I feel full of energy, and have only had two moments of craving, but they didn't last very long.

Wishing all of you on here also quitting or trying to quit the best of luck, we can do this guys!

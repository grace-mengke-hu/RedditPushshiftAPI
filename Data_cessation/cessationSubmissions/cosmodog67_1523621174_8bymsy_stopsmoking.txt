Chantix: how far in until you quit?

First post here:) I've smoked 2 packs a day for 23 years. I quit once on Chantix back in '09 and had one whole month before my dog died. Used Chantix again in '11. Had one whole month before my dad died suddenly of cardiac arrest while in the ticket office of Kansas State University purchasing K-State/Texas Tech tickets.

I desperately want to quit, and for a million reasons. Had a health scare a few weeks ago with a biopsy done on the bottom of my mouth. All is okay, but the two weeks of being sent to a specialist (oral surgeon) and waiting for results was terrifying.

There's nothing more that I like about smoking anymore but I am just so damn addicted. I finished Alan Carr's book last week and tried cold turkey. I applaud the hell outta anyone who quits that way. I truly do. I just need some help but don't necessarily want NRT.

ANYWAY, (geez), if you have taken Chantix (Champix for you tea-sippers:)), how long did you take it before you quit? I've been on it for 5 days, so I'm at half a dose until Monday, when I go to a full dose.

3 years of not smoking

I had been smoking 9-10 years before I quit cold turkey. 
I had tried to quit multiple times before, smoking less, buying smaller packages, switching to snus, and every time I came back smoking more then before.
At my worst I was rolling non-filter cigarets with a snus under my lip, also when menthol cigarets came out I was smoking like a chimney.

The urges are still triggered now and then from my SO being a smoker, but it's nothing I can't handle.

The day I quit, I had been speaking to my boss about trying to quit again, he told me he didn't believe me as I had failed so many times before. I had one last smoke and threw away the remaining cigarets, and I didn't look back. 

I can now happily say, I'm better off financially and I am much healthier, thou I do miss the social aspect of it. 

I wish you all good luck with quitting as well!

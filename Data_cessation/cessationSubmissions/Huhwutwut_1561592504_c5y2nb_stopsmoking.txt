I failed

I had cigarettes beat, I was done with them for a month, but I went back.

Slowly at first, two at lunch each day, then I added two at the beginning of the day, then two at the end of the day.

I'm back to having cravings again and I'm pretty disgusted with myself. Now I have to confess to my app (but not to my wife) and get back off the weed.

I'm starting again tomorrow, wish me luck.

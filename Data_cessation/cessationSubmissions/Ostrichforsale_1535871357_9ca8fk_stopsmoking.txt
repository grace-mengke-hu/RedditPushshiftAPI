Day 8 but really Day 3

Had a drag on a friends fag 3 days ago, loved it. Regretted it as soon as it was over and I was feeling nicotined up.

I find myself longing for cigarettes, why did I quit, they’re not that bad, I enjoy smoking.

I quit because I don’t want my life expectancy to suffer for myself and those around me so that I can gain a 2 minute buzz. I quit because I was a slave to nicotine, it ran my life. I quit because it’s expensive and I don’t have the money to keep going and live. 

I’ve actually bought a CBD vape to counter some of these desperate feelings I have for a smoke. Let’s see how that goes. Sorry for the rant

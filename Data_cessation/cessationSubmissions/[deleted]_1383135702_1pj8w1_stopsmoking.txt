Just made the choice, and tossed my cigarettes. Living in a household with smoking roommates, I could use some words of encouragement.

Edit: Thank you so much, everybody, for the words of encouragement. Day one is almost in the books, and it's been really helpful to be able to go into my notifications and see people supporting me. You guys are the best.

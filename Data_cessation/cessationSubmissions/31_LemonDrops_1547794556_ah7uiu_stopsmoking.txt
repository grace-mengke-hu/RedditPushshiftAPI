Day 16: A funky side to quitting...

Earlier, I was sitting on my couch, and I could smell the most rank, mildew smell. I couldn't tell where it was coming from for almost an hour. Then I looked down to see my boys' tennis shoes by the coffee table. I took a whiff of each of pair, and the third pair smelled like some sort of mixture between mildew, pungent preteen angst, and a rotten corpse. How long have his shoes smelled like this and I haven't known?!

Now that I've quit smoking and my sense of smell is getting better, I can smell this glorious aroma! (And douse it with Gold Bond powder!) Yay? ðŸ˜‚

How many cravings per day?

Today is one week without smoking.  I am using the patch and have been doing pretty well besides some mood swings, etc.  Out of curiosity, how many cravings per day were you guys having during the first week?

I smoked a pack a day since Iâ€™m 16 (34 now).  I fully expect the cravings to continue for awhile but not sure if the frequency declines quickly.

Thanks

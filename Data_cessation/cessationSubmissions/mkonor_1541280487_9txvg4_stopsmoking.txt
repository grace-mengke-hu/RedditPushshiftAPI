brain fog can't study

24yr. M

I really don't know where to start. so i started smoking weed mixed with tobacco intermittently for about 3 months then i stopped mixing in the weed because i felt it affected my sleep. so i started smoking just weed daily for about 3 months straight from September to November last year. but i was always a light smoker taking just 4 to 6 puffs before bed.

in December last year i decided to quit smoking in general because i started developing cloudy memory and difficulty concentrating which was really affecting me as a med student. Quitting weed was difficult so i started to smoke half a cig at night to ease the symptoms (i know, stupid, from frying pan to fire). But i only ever smoked half a cig a day and never even smoked for up to 3 days straight. Eventually, i stopped smoking cigs as well. so my problem, from January this year i have been having severe brain fog that only lets up for a few days. Its so bad i cant study and nothing helps.

Although, i must mention that i relapsed twice with weed and twice with cigs on different occasions during the last 10 months.

i guess my questions are :

has anyone had similar experiences with nicotine or marijuana?

do you think a history of half a cig a day for less than a month is enough to make someone addicted to nicotine?

do you have full withdrawal symptoms after relapsing with just a single cigarette?

Just bought a pack today, quitting tomorrow night

I'm 21, been smoking since I was like 16 or 17. I thought it would make me look cool, but here I am now 5 or 6 years later still smoking and not feeling very cool. My fianc√©e smokes and at one point said she went a week without one and turned me down when I offered her one. She started back up again :( I'm thinking, maybe if I quit it will influence her to? She was doing so good too.. It's hard though. I downloaded that Quitsmoking! app and I hope that will help me. Maybe if she sees that I've quit, she'll try to quit again too. It's so hard for us though. It's a social thing. It's a thing to relieve stress. It's a thing to help us talk about stuff. But I'm done.. I work at a gas station with a car wash and every single employee except one smokes, so peer pressure is huge here. She also stresses at her job at Home Depot. So wish me luck tomorrow night guys. Tomorrow night at 10 PM, I'm gonna try to quit.*Try*...

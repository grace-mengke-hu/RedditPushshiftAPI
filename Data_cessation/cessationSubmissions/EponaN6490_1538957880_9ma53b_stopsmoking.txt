14 days down. Many more to go ðŸ¤ž

Hey all just subbed to this group. This is probably my fourth attempt to quit smoking in about 9 years. My longest run was just over a year without a cigarette, but then life happened. Needless to say Iâ€™m surrounded by smokers. My husband smokes, 75% of my friends smoke and so Iâ€™m personally finding that the hardest hurdle. 

Do any of you (accomplished or relapsed) quitters faces this problem yourselves?

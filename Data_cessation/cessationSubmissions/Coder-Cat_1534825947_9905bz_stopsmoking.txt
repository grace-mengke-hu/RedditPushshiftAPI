When does the rage stop?

So, first I would like to say AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH   *inhales* AAAHHHAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!F@#% EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER AND  I HATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ¤¬ğŸ¤¬ğŸ¤¬ğŸ¤¬ğŸ¤¬ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

Secondly, Iâ€™m wondering when does this anger end? Itâ€™s been exactly 4 weeks now and I feel like the rage Iâ€™ve formally reserved for animal abusers and racists is now being directed towards the cashier at the sandwich shop(omg Iâ€™m so embarrassed for my behavior Iâ€™m so sorry) or the people who donâ€™t know how to properly use round-abouts(no regrets fuck yâ€™all).

Its like Iâ€™m angrier now than I was two weeks ago but my loved ones are sick of the excuse and my poor boyfriend,  who is a god damn saint, I think is looking for a reason to martyr himself. 

When does this feeling go away? Does it ever? What are some things you guys did to control or redirect this black hole of anger and hatred. Iâ€™m not saying I was a perfect joy to be around before, but now Iâ€™m down right mean and hateful for no reason and Iâ€™m becoming depressed.

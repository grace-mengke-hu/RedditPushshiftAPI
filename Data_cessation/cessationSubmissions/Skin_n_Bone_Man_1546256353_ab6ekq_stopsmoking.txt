I really, really want to stop.

As a long time daily smoker I'm both terrified of continuing and quitting. I know that because I'm scared of both, I should do the one that is most beneficial but it doesn't make it any easier. I've read Allen Carr's book and it worked for a while. But I continued to smoke weed and eventually got sucked back into tobacco. I think I'm going to quit tonight. Clich√©, but fuck it .. one night is as good as any other. Wish me luck people. As I wish luck to all of you.

Low bg

Hi I've not smoked for 17 days now 
, the last 3 days I have been feeling really tired,dizzy,very vacant and no concentration.  My son is type 1 diabetic and i suddenly thought today that i was feeling like he describes when his blood levels are low . Tested my blood with his kit and my bg was 3.4 (which is low) ate my dinner carb laden pasta dish a can of coke and a chocolate bar re tested and I was still only 3.9 . I've been looking online and apparently hypoglycaemia (low blood levels) is a know side effect from nicotine withdrawal.... did anybody know about this ??

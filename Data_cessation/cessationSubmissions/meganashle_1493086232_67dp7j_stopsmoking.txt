Quit date. 
I've been wanting to quit smoking for a while but really, I haven't put too much effort into it. I just keep giving in and lighting up, so I've downloaded a few apps to help me quit, see how much money I'm saving and how my health improves and etc... 

My mother also wants to quit so she's joined my quit date, I'm hoping she sticks with it because I feel like it will help us both to have support and not be smoking around each other while one is trying to quit. 

A few months ago I quit for a week and after the first day I was getting complimented on my perfume and being told my hair smelled good and that was a good feeling, no body likes to be told they smell like an ashtray. 

In the meantime before my official quit date I am going to try to cut back slowly, even if I crave a cigarette and just skip one a day, hey that's progress, right? And it's awesome to hear everyone's stories and how many smoke free days they are having! I'm looking forward to the day I can say that I do not smoke! The day I beat temptation, quit a nasty habit and overcame an obstacle. I wanna kick cravings to the curb and learn to live my life without a cigarette in my hand. It's taking too much of my time, literally and figuratively.

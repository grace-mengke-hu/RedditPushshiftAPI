Any Festival Tips?

Every year I go to the same festival in the summer.  It's wonderful.  We camp there.  We see lots of friends.  We have a blast.  But every year I've smoked.  Even if I've been quit for months.  I think the only two years I didn't smoke was during pregnancies.  That was many years ago.  

Anyway, does anyone have any tips for staying strong during festivals?

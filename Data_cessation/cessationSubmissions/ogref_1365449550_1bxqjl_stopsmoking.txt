How I'm accidentally quitting...

I've been trying to quit for over a year...  I've been on Chantix, hypnotized, and tried other various bullshit methods for quitting... except just quitting cold turkey.  

Well, because of the quantity of travel I've been doing over the last month, I've weened myself down to 2-3 butts a day.

This morning I pulled into the airport parking lot, forgot my smokes in the center console, forgot to have one with my morning coffee, forgot to have on on my commute to the airport, etc.etc.etc.  

Literally, I forgot to smoke this morning...  maybe I'll actually quit this time.

Started to quit smoking today

I did tried to quit but I always fall back into it.
I smoked my last cig in the morning that was 4 hours ago. And I decided not to smoke any more. I do have some headce but it will pass I hope. It now a vacation so it not gonna change If I will be irritated by that. 

It gonna be hell for the next week..

1st try and have failed already, any tips?

So I recently decided to quit smoking after about a pack a day for 10 years. Not for health benefits, not because of a sudden realization that it's a gross habit, not because of any other reason than I can't afford it. I had to choose between gas and cigarettes this week and was ashamed that I struggled with the choice.

My problem is that, I really don't have the motivation to quit. Unfortunately, that lack of motivation prompted me to dig around for every last bit of spare change to buy that $9 pack of smokes.

I lasted 9 hours total before caving. The final hour all I could think about was smoking. It left me dizzy, lightheaded, and disgusted with myself for giving in so easily. And yet my cravings had been eased.

I'm trying my hardest to refrain from habitual smoking and that actually seems to work for me.

Does anyone have any tips for a first time quitter? Any ways to help clear toxins from a body rapidly to help speed the first week nightmare?

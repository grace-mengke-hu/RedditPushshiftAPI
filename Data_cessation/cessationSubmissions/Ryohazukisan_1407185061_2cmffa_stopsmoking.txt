24 days in, some insights that may help us all stay smoke free...

Smoking is something we started for whatever a variety of reasons, but its something that grew well beyond the original reason for smoking. 

Relapsing, sort of the same thing.

We get depressed or upset in a moment of time, and in that moment we may make a rash decision about relapsing because we hate our life... BUT if we did relapse we would get hooked again and when our life turns around (as it usually does), we don't then stop smoking... because by that time we are hooked (again). 

So when you are feeling like relapsing, DON'T. Not to save yourself in that moment, but to save the great guy you are in the future from being a crippled slave... again. 

Let me know what you guys think

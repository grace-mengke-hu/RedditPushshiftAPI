What was helpful for me this time.

Hi there!
At first, I’m sorry for my English, I am just studying it. My phone app suggested me to post here about things that helped me to quit smoking. I have been a smoker for 9 years since I was 20. My norm was a pack a day.  All these years I was constantly trying to quit, sometimes more than ten times in a year. I read “Easy way” twice or more, used Tabex several times, and went cold turkey many times too. My longest attempt lasted about a year before relapse. So, now I have a big experience in quitting, and I hope I won’t smoke again. I want to share some techniques which helped me this time:

1)	Exercises! I went to a gym, and this is very productive for giving up smoking. First time I felt very bad but I didn’t want to smoke at all! I think this was a trigger for quit smoking. 

2)	I threw out all remaining cigarettes and lighters. This always helps me at first days. When you need to go to the store for cigarettes there is a small barrier between you and your addiction, which could help you to stay free.

3)	I didn’t use NRT or tablets for quit smoking this time, but from one book I’ve read that tablets of glucose could be helpful and they were for me. I think that glucose decreases severity of cravings.

4)	I’ve install one android app for quitters. I read this reddit and articles about harm of smoking on other sites for motivation.

5)	Also, from one book about willpower I’ve read that 10 minutes per day of meditation with concentration on your breathing could increase your willpower. I don’t know is it true, but I use it and think it’s helpful for me.

6)	I refuse coffee as a strong trigger, but I think I can return to it now.

7)	I’ve started to eat breakfast.

8)	I don’t drink too much. I think it is good to avoid alcohol during first weeks.

9)	Main tning is your desire to be a non-smoker. 

I am feeling much better now! Hope this will help somebody who wants to give up smoking. Good luck!

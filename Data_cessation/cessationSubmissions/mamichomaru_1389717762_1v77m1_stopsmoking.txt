I just realized I'm not even trying now.

As my flair says, I've been clean for the last 432 days.

The first months, were fucking hell for me. Everything reminded me about smoking. A cold afternoon, the steak I just ate, drinking with friends, waking up, waiting at some line, even going to the WC, everything brought those cravings back to the surface. I had a real mind battle with my primal self, that idiot who doesn't reason. The inner ape child that only wants immediate pleasure.

I remember having to shout to myself in my mind. I once had to throw the change I had in my pocket when I realized I was mindlessly about to buy a loose cigarette.

But for quite a while now, I haven't even thought about smoking. Not even when someone is smoking in front of me. The smell of the smoke is now almost unpleasant. Things are going smooth for me now. It's easier than ever and I just have to stay in the path.

It's like if I had to learn how to live without smoking. The hardest part was learning, but now that I know how, it's a piece of cake.

Stay strong friends!

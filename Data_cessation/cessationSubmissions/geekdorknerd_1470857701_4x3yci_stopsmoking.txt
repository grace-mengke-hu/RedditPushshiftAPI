My App is SUPER boring

I downloaded Kwit because I was like OOH I like goals and winning imaginary things! Like I was irrationally excited when my badge switched to the week counter. And I'm dying to get a star.  I want a gold star so bad.  My app isn't that exciting though. I was not a heavy smoker.  By the time I quit I was down to 3-5 cigarettes a day.  And I live in a cheap state to smoke.  So I've been quit for 2 weeks and my app is like - you saved $20.  And I'm cool with that.  That's $20 I didn't smoke - but I feel like others have way more impressive stats. 

So my app is super boring but I still haven't smoked in 15 days.  And I feel good...like really good. It honestly has not been as hard as I expected...or as hard as the last times.  I don't know what changed but I can't let my guard down yet.

Everyone else - keep going.  You can do it!

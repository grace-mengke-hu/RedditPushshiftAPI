Day 1 and some advise

After many relapse and many attempt i decided now is the time, but haven't made a serious plan, so looking for some advise or tips to go through the possible cravings.
How did you guys do it?
The biggest temptation is having a 7/11 and family mart at ground floor of my condo in Bangkok. Not a good thing.

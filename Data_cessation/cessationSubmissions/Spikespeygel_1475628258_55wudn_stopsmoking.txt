Guys I quit cold turkey today..

It is currently 8:42 pm and I was good all day up until about fifteen minutes ago. I have only quit one time before and it was cold turkey but due to some deaths in the family and other stresses in life I started back up again. I was currently smoking between a pack and a half and two packs a day. If anyone is out there that can give me tips on how to make this withdrawal go smoother please speak up. I literally can't believe how badly this feels.

Today has been day one...this is really difficult

Today has been the first day without a cigarette for 15 years. I can't believe how ridicules this sounds.

What should I expect in the coming days? This day has been full of imagining myself lighting it up and inhaling that first, fresh, intake. 

Thanks for your support!

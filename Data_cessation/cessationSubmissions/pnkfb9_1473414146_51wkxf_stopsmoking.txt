day 2 - need help

Hi guys,I'm 25M and I finally decided to quit all my bad habits, including my dear sigarettes. I quit cold turkey with weed three weeks ago, but the Real problems are coming: today I realized that I fear to live without smoking. I perfectly know that is irrational, and is not the Real me that is talking, I've Always been that guy that, when lighted a cig, told to himself "why you do this, you know that is an error,you are not that guy that falls into addiction".. wtf it really scared me. Like I have Always smoke as a reward to thing done in my daily routine. This shit tricked me for long time. I've Always been a smart guy with lot of interests, but now, like with MJ , all seems to lose interest. Hope that someone had passed my same situation and overcomed this shitty feeling.

Have a nice day!

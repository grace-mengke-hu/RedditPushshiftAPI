OMG!!

Trying to quit smoking is so bloody hard . learning to deal with the hardcore cravings is becoming repetitive and draining. I dont know how m,uch longer i can go without one. I keep telling myself that 'just one more day' and the horrid cravings will stop . Its been about 2 months since ive had one but i think about it atleast 30 times a day, i even get to a point where i could cry i want one so badly .

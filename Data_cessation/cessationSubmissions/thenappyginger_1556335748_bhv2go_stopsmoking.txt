5 days out from my quit day, would love some advice from you inspiring people

So I’ve been smoking for about 4 years now. Picked up a pack a day habit when I was abroad, and have been smoking since. It usually was about 5-8 cigarettes a day as I would never smoke at work, but would basically chain when I got home. 

For the past year or so I switched to a vape with 50mg of nicotine and I’m smoking more than ever now. I hate the tastes of cigarettes now so that’s a plus. 

I’ve quit for a week or a month here and there but always fall back into it. I know it’s probably contributing to some mental health stuff I need to deal with and I miss being able to run and sing, etc. 

So, I figured I’d ask you all how the hell did you do this? I’ve tried switching to 0mg but I just hit it more and get frustrated. I’ve tried subbing with sunflower seeds, mints, or tea but it never sticks. 

Also, I work as a furniture maker, so I’m around dangerous tools all day and need to focus. When I tried quitting about a month ago, I came back after two days because I could not focus and I felt like I was being a danger to myself and those around me as a result. Any tips for focus specifically?

I know this is super broad, but since it is my last weekend as a smoker, I thought I would really try to strategize on how to break and stay off this habit. Thank you so so much!!

I just wanted to say thank you.

It's been 68 days for me according to my counter, I've honestly stopped counting. I actually quit using the electronic cigarettes. Now I know a lot of you won't agree that it's quitting, but it actually worked for me. The great community here as well as /r/electronic_cigarettes have helped me tremendously in this journey. 

I went from smoking a pack a day for 6 years, to vaping 0 nicotine leveled vapor only when I've been drinking (because the flavor is delicious and I still like hanging out with my smoking buddies outside). The best part about this, is not only was it possibly the EASIEST transition, but I'm so much happier. I no longer smell, and can walk up stairs with no problem. Also, I'M SAVING SO MUCH MONEY.


So, thank you all who have helped. To those who are just getting started, you can do it no matter what your method is! Stay strong all.

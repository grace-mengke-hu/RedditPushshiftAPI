Over 7 months cigarette free. Just want to tell you all it's possible and gets way easy!

I don't even have the slightest bit of urge to smoke anymore. Not smoking is very comfortable and normal now! 

I remember the few few months were hard. I had to actively "not smoke", but it really does get more natural so hang in there!

Day 1

So I quit today, for my husband. I had smoked for 7 years and quit for 2 when I started back up again in September. I kept telling myself it was just a short phase and I wouldn't allow it to become habit... but of course, it did. On Monday of this past week I realized it has become normalized again. That is **not** okay. 

I'm not just quitting for him, I want my energy back, I want to smell nice again, I want to stop having to pump the brakes on everyday life so I can go outside and get my fix. 

My only real fear is weight gain. I have an EXTENSIVE history with EDs and I have finally reached a point where I am comfortable with myself. Gaining weight remains among one of the fears I hold on a level with being burned alive or having bamboo chutes stinted under my fingernails. I know the metabolism is bound to drop with the quitting, so I have to really watch intake and get active. Smoking was really starting to piss me off because it was making it near impossible to get through a long bike ride. 

Aaaanyway, I know I rambled here. I am just glad I found a sub where I can read others' struggles and remedies and know that I'm not fighting this asshole beast of an addiction alone. Thanks for reading, and good luck with your own fight.

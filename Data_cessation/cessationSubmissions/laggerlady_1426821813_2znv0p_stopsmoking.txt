Coming up to one month!

On sunday I will be one month smoke free! According to my app, I have not smoked 492 cigarettes and have saved 270 bucks and regained 148 hours of life. This is all great but what it does not say is that I have regained my life back. I started smoking at 15 and have smoked regularly until one month ago and I am 57. I have never been free from my addiction as an adult! I have been enslaved my whole life. It is such an amazing feeling to not worry about where my next smoke is coming from. To not have to worry every night if I have enough to last me, to avoid places and things that make it hard to smoke, to dread traveling because I could not smoke on a plane! I have the freedom to do anything I want and because I have stopped smoking, I realize that if  I am strong enough to overcome this demon, there ain't nothing I can't accomplish. Thanks so much to everyone on this site for being there. Reading your posts helped me so much. I know that I will always have to be on guard against this addiction, but I know I can do it! For all you lurkers who, like me, are reading these posts and wondering if you could do it - YOU CAN! Believe in yourself, you are stronger than you know. Join me today and lets not smoke together.

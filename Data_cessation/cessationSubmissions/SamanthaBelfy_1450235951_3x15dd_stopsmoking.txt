Triple digit club!!

After 14 years of smoking I have hit the 100 day mark for quitting smoking! At first I used a vape to ease out of cigarettes and eventually tapered off of that as well. I hardly ever think about it anymore, only when someone asks me how long it's been or if I see someone smoking. 
In the beginning, I didn't think there would ever come a time where I would not think about it, but I promise that it happens!! Keep at it!!

Quitting and Breaking Up

I have fallen back to cigarettes twice after break ups. Now I find myself in a break up with the greatest love I have had in my life. The last time I went through a break up I ended up smoking for over 2.5 years. I have been quit for over two months now with 670 unsmoked cigs! It's going pretty well and getting easier. However, this break up is a real heart breaking event. I will not go back to smoking. I know it will not help everything I am going through. I never want to quit again. I am done. But of course cravings are rearing their heads when it was getting easier. I am just so sad sometimes. Thanks for letting me share and vent a little. This sub has given me so much support. Keep going everyone! Peace.

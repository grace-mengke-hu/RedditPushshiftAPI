Day 3 going strong

So 3 and a half days now since my last Cig. 
Feeling good and sometimes I think about smoking one just because there is nothing else to do. 
Just ask myself: Do I need it? No. Do i want it? No. So why even think about it. 
Cravings pretty much nonexistent, which I’m suprised of cause I used to smoke a pack a day. 
Most of the time i don’t even think about smoking cause I try to stay busy :) 
Thanks for your support guys, especially the first day it really helped to come here and inform myself how it can feel like to quit and now I’m Prepared :)

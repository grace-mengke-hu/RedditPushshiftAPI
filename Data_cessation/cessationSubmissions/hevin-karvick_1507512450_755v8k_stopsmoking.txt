The 'no-brainer' failure

Ok. An almost failure. 

This really scared me today. 4Â½ months ago I quit using Chantix. Today was the first time I reached for my smokes without even thinking about it like it was the most normal and natural thing in the world. I'm 55. I started stealing them from dad when I was 15, 40 years ago. The last time I quit I made it a year and a half and started back up fully aware of what I was doing. This time it scared me to the core. I don't want to smoke. Not today. Not ever. But to think that my body remembers that action so deeply that I had no control over it is terrifying. Only when my hand came up empty dud I realize what just happened. There were no smokes there to be had. I can't say that if there had been any cigarette near me then I would have smoked.

Another awareness and another success I suppose. And another day smoke free.

P. S. I have not posted here much but I have to say thank you. Your postings here of successes and failures are a tremendous help. Thank you.

Anyone just wake up and not want a cigarette?

Im trying to start my quit, and I have noticed that some days, I'll wake up and the last thing on my mind is smoking. I usually smoke one anyway to avoid withdrawal at inconvenient times (e.g. in college classes), but I dont really NEED to. Anyone else have this happen? Should I try to use it as a quit date if I wake up and feel that way?
Thanks!

Starting over today

I was able to go 44 days without smoking last time. The trigger was drinking alcohol. But I had no cravings at all when sober, so that's a good sign! Now I just have to handle the drunk-cravings.
The worst thing about starting again was the taste, it was so disgusting and I started to miss the feeling when the it tasted good, so it made me start again. Now I know the dangers to smoke just one.
Now that I've quit one time, I know how easy it was to get over the first cravings and how good I felt, so it should be easier this time.

Edit: Still haven't managed to quit, I will reset my badge when I have gone 2-3 days without smoking. :(

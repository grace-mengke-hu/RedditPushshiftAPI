Gave in after 3 days and some change

I successfully made it 3 days and a few hours without a cig. Gave in and smoked one. it did taste pretty fucking bad, I might add. I'm not fully regretting it. I will continue making an effort to not light up again, however I feel like cold turkey was too brutal to handle for my first attempt at quitting. I was only smoking 5-10 a day, for a couple of years. I hate myself for it a little, but I'm happy with the progress I've made. Here's to another 3 days. It's important to note that while I know I fucked up, it's a huge improvement, and I'm still proud of myself for making it as far as I did. 

Thank you to everyone for your kind words and enthusiasm, I continue to look forward to making an active effort to quit. One step at a time, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction.

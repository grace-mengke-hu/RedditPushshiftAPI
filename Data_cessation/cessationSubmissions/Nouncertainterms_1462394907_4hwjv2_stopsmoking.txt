Just need some motivation

It's been about 25 hours since my last. Realistically I know I'll never smoke again but that's fucking scary. I gave cigarettes 10 years of my life and I don't know what to do now without them. Sure the withdrawal is fucking bad, but so is feeling bored and confused all the time because your body so badly wants the drug. 

Hope you don't mind my mini-rant. I'm having a tough go of it at the moment and could use motivation. When does it get easier? Does it get easier?

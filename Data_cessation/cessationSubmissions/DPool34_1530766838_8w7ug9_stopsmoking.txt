Questions about Chantix...

I quit smoking by transitioning from cigarettes to a vape pen over a year ago and I’ve been fine. I’m asking for my mother. 

She quit for 15 years and then went back to smoking a couple years ago during a stressful event. She wants to take Chantix. 

I’ve heard mixed things about it. There’s the horror stories about the suicides and night terrors, but there’s also the issue of relapse. 

It sounds like a lot of people take it, quit smoking for awhile, and then go back to smoking. This has been popularized recently with Anthony Bourdain’s death.

What’s your take on Chantix? Is it really a useful smoking cessation tool, or just something pushed by doctors because it’s a pill —something that can be prescribed and therefore charged for?

Week 1 - 2.0

I have been a smoker for the last 5 years and in that time I have never tried to quit. To support my success rate, I got a prescription to Chantix but it sat on my kitchen table for ~3 months.  About 2 weeks ago, I decided "the right time" is never going to come and the next day I began taking the chantix and preparing a list of my reasons for quitting and some of my triggers.

So, Feb. 15 was my official quit day.  The beginning of the week was difficult. Days 2 and 3 were dreadful but manageable for the most part.  My coworkers have been supportive one gave me $20 with the expectation that if I smoked by Friday(day 6), I would have to give it back(citing some negative reinforcement lecture in college).  

On day 6, I woke up filling better than I have in 5 years and gladly told my coworker.  I had forgotten to take chantix that morning, which I corrected at lunch but work issues(Stress Trigger) came up so by lunch I was almost constantly having cravings.  While driving for 10 hours(biggest trigger - I have always chain smoked in cars) that day, I tried redirecting by making phone calls, listening to relaxing music, and eventually pulling over to look at pictures of my infant niece.  I lasted 5 hours like this but had to get gas and I caved.  I smoked 2 in total before throwing them and the lighter out the window.  The taste was awful and I never got a buzz so I am thankful I had the chantix for support.  

TLDR: Today is a new day and I am refocused to my commitment to improving my health and quality of life.  I am very glad I found this sub last night while trying to find new ways to strengthen my success.  Week 1 day 1 - 2.0!

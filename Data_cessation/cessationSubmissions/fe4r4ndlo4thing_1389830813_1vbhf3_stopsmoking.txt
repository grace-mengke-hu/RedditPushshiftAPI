Today's the day

This is my first reddit post, so here goes it. I'm 20 years old and living in Eastern Kentucky. Ale-8, park-and-rides and smoking were all just things we did to pass the time in my little town, so I started smoking as a coming-of-age sort of thing (probably around 14). Life threw me a few curveballs that ought to have convinced me to quit. Type 1 diabetes, my grandpa being diagnosed with lung cancer years after he quit, and a few others. None of it worked, though.

Long story short, the past couple of years have sucked, and I'm trying to turn my life around. Part of that means getting my scrawny ass in shape, and I can't do that smoking a pack of Luckies a day. I threw away all my lighters today, and I'm getting my badge tomorrow. I'm really committing to quitting, and hopefully having accountability to someone, even a forum of strangers, will help me out. It's a great thing you all are doing here, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Wish me luck!

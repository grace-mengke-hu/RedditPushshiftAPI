How can I keep clean?

As a 20y/o young man, having smoked for the better part of 4 years, it's time to kick the habit. A week ago I left to go on holiday with my family, I smoked a cig before driving to the airport, but since arriving in Spain I've kept clean (despite the amount of alcohol consumed). My worry is that when I get home, I will fall back into the habit. In my immediate circle of friends more than 70% smoke (it's 4am and I can't do the exact maths). 


On top of this, a relative of mine was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer, caused by smoking throughout their life. This has taken a toll on my mother, but despite her best efforts I continued to smoke.


I've read a fair few posts, and it seems that the sub is split between kicking the friends or persevering in the face of adversity. I cannot lose my friends, but I fear my self-discipline is not of a calibre that would allow me to remain smoke free.


What methods; both physical and digital, have you employed to stay on the straight and narrow? I fly home on Saturday night and my friends are meeting me to welcome me home, the first test as it would seem. 

r/stopsmoking I need your help, I'm not yet adult enough to do this by myself.


Thank you in advance for all your help.

All out of cigarettes.

Oh, man...I know this needs to end. I'm almost 37 and I've been smoking since I was 14 years old. I only quit during two pregnancies, and I quit then by tapering off. I want to be alive for my children. I never really had much to live for before they were born, so screw it if I wanted to smoke, drink, etc...but now I am trying to eliminate harmful vices. As of today I have been alcohol-free for 130 days. I now want to quit smoking so badly, but I already crave one like crazy. I purposely didn't buy another pack after I ran out last night, so I don't have any. I am hoping that I have the willpower to not buy another pack. This is going to be SO HARD.

Going in 100%.

Sad to say I've already made a post on this sub, but that attempt didn't last long. The longest I have quit was for 3 months in 2016, but even that was completely out of the blue. Woke up one morning and just didn't smoke for 3 months.

A little backstory: 28 years old, smoked for 15 years. Not always physically active but have been for the past 6 years or so. Big into calisthenics and this past January I set a goal for myself to run a half-marathon. I did that on May 6th with a time of 2:30, which was great for my standards.

However, soon after I went back to my 2 packs a day. I barely think about anything else but quitting smoking. It's the one thing I seem to have no control over. I've decided to change that for good for the benefit of myself and my family.

I probably won't be posting regularly but even if one person reads this and sends good thoughts, it's a start. Eventually I'll post an update. I'm beyond fed up with this shitty habit.

Thanks for reading!

Day One: Champix-Assisted

Hey folks,

I am taking Champix to quit smoking. I know there are mixed opinions on it, and some horror stories, but I've tried everything and feel this is my best shot.

I am on day nine of the drugs now â€“ I was told to stop smoking between days 7-10. I actually decided to stop smoking yesterday, and made it through the day with no real issues. I had no cravings, but did have moments where I would stand up from my desk, put on my jacket, and then be like "oh... right. I don't do this anymore" and I'd take my jacket off and sit back down and go through the whole routine again an hour later. It was sort of awesome how easy it was to not do it, but the actual habit of getting ready to go was very surreal.

I then got drunk last night and had three cigarettes. What an idiot I am. I got absolutely nothing out of those cigarettes. I'm back on the train this morning - reboot!

The one thing that concerns me is some of the side-effects. I have no known disorders, but have definitely witnessed a change in personality and mood since beginning the drug. It's nowhere near as pronounced as some people have had it, but it does worry me slightly. I haven't heard any comments from other people on the change, but I've had mood swings, I'm more easily irritable (even though I was still smoking), and I've snapped out at people in rage who I never would have before.

If it gets much worse, I will probably not take the full three months of prescription, and hope that it has gotten me through the roughest patch.

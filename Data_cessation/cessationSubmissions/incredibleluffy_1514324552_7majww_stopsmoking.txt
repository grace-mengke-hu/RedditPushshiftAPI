Hear me out?

I've recently decided to quit smoking cigarettes. I came back from college for my vacations and I used to smoke around 30 a day. It's been a couple of days since I've stopped, but it's not easy with my friends still talking about it. Funnily, I don't feel like smoking except when someone is talking about it.
I've gone cold turkey for now, but the problem starts here. I have to return to college in a week and there we add tobacco to our pot before smoking it. I can't expect them to stop doing that and I honestly don't feel like stopping smoking weed. Will smoking that much amount of tobacco create a problem for me, both health-wise and quitting cigarettes-wise? Are there any alternatives that I can look into?

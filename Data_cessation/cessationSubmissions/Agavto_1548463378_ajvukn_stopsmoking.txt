Little advise

Today is my fourth day and honestly I feel very comfortable, healthy.

Let me tell you this: i decided to quit smoking because one night when i was precisely smoking it taste like hell! And you know what? Your body is so wise! Since that moment i started rejecting all that has to do with cigarretes and then i understood that it was my time because like i said, my body decided.

Follow your body, that is my advise!

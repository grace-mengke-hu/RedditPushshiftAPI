One week down!

Badge says 6 days but it's actually day 7 for me. I seriously can't believe it. First days I felt like on the edge of relapse all the time. I just couldn't relax. I'm happy to inform that the constant cravings have settled down. Yesterday was the first morning that I woke up and DIDN'T think of having a morning cigarette. The automatic thoughts have lessened significantly. Mood swings have settled, same with anxiety levels. Although two ex smokers told me to watch out for week 2-3/1 month mark, because that's when it gets difficult? I didn't really understand what they meant. Could some of you with some time on your backs fill me in on this one?

Anyway, I feel relieved and more energetic in general. Here's to one day at a time!

On day 14 and having the worst cravings yet.

Since October I've been trying to quit, typically lasting a week then I slip. My previous record is 13 days so I'm one day past that now and I'm having the worst cravings yet. I really want to buy a pack just to smoke for the night and then throw the rest away (done it in the past) but I know this isn't beneficial in any way.

(My star is wrong, sorry!) I'm a little over a week quit and close to cracking, help me!

Like the title says, I'm a little more than a week quit (no smokes since last Tuesday, 10ish PM). I'm currently having a pretty hard time, I guess since the cravings haven't really changed in any substantive way. Also, the main impetus for this post is the fact that I'm drunk, which I would say is my biggest trigger for smoking. It might seem silly, but proving to myself that I can indulge in my triggers without cracking is a big step for my addiction, because I'm not willing to give up my other vices at this point in time. 

All that being said, I'm currently pretty close to running across the street and at least trying to bum one off somebody. Talk me out of it, please? My brain knows I shouldn't, but I feel like it's killing me.

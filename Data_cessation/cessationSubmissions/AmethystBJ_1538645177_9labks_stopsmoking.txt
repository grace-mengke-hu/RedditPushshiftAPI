I'm Edoardo and I wanted to propose a survey on market research for app development on smoking cigarettes

Hello guys! I'm a recent graduate and I've just started the Apple Developer Academy. I need people who compile this very short survey to verify the actual interest in the subject (which is smoking) in order to start developing an app for iOS.

The survey is for both those who smoke and those who do not smoke (or for those who quit).

The results remain clearly anonymous and there is no need for registration.

Thanks a lot for the collaboration!

For any further questions about the nature of the survey, the author and how the data will be processed ... ask me!

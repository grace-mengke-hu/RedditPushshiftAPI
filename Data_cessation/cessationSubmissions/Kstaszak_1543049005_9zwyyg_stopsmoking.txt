I think I have just turned into a closet smoker

So Thanksgiving was horrible,  I smoked 2 cigarettes, previously was a 20 cig a day addiction.... tonight I went out with friends after work,  on my way home I smoked 2 more.... I'm just over 5 days,  but I am not sure if the 2 each day requires me to reset my clock since under normal circumstances I'm fine,  I just havent figured out how to get through a holiday without smoking..... what would u do?

Another July 1, Day One. Wish me luck, give me strength!

I'm 32, nearly 33. Been smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day for at least 10 years and smoked a little less for 4 or 5 years before that. I've tried to quit a bunch of times but have only ever made it for a week or two before I've smoked "just because I'm out drinking."

I want to climb mountains, cycle for hours, get lean and sing. I don't want to stink, cough, pant, have high blood pressure or die young from smoking. I want to stop smoking, I want to be free of this bullshit.

It's not going to super easy for me, I know that from experience. I decided to wear a patch for the first few days just so I have a physical commitment to not smoking and also to ease the initial anxiety.

I've lurked here for awhile and plan to stop in when in fits of rage and confusion and conflicting emotions for support. Thanks all for offering this space. Wishing you all well and success in your productive endeavors.

Fuck cigarette addiction. If I can get through this I'm going to get a rad tattoo to reward myself and commemorate the achievement.

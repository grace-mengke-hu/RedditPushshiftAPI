My Friend and I Are Quitting Together (Littering is bad, but drastic times...)

I stayed at a friends house last night and when I woke up this morning I asked to bum a cig. We sat and smoked and  I let him know I'd get him a pack since I had smoked basically all of his the night before. He told me not to because he was trying to quit before he bought that pack. 

I asked him if he wanted to form a pact to quit smoking together and he was excited to do it. We went outside with our lighters and got the rest of them from out of our cars and threw them in a puddle. He threw his cigarettes in the puddle and I poured my can of dip in the mud. Not saying littering is good, but I didn't want either of us to have any easy access. I had some nicotine patches and gum in my car from my last attempt. I split what I had between us and then headed out. 

We have been calling each other constantly today, but neither of us has smoked and are resisting using gum until the urge is too overwhelming. I just got off the phone with him a bit ago and he was telling me he still had his vape. He sent me a video of him throwing it into the puddle as well. 

I feel better about this quit than any attempt I've made in the past. Any tips on how to keep each other going would be appreciated.

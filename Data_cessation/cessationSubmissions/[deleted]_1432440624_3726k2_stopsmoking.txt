Yesterday Was My 3 Week Mark and I Suddenly Started Craving Again

Is that normal? Today, too. My appetite grew insatiable as a result, which bums me out, 'cos I managed to drop some lbs, but anyway. Yeah, I really haven't craved any until now. 

Ooh, and I also woke up this morning and my throat felt like I'd been smoking the night before. This happened maybe 2 weeks ago or so, too. that happen to anyone around here?

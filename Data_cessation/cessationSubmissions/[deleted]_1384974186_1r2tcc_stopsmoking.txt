5 days, I miss my voice

First day I had maybe 10 minutes of anxiousness but I convinced myself it was all in my head and I got control over it. Had a headache that lasted a hour or two on my second day. 3-5th days I had no cravings or anything and my mood hasn't changed at all.


The only thing I really miss about smoking is my voice. It has gotten significantly clearer but it is more bassy. As a smoker it required more effort to talk so I was forced to talk at a bit higher pitch and it sounded a lot clearer. Now it's a muddy and deep mess so I need to relearn how to speak. 


But the fresh air is nice.

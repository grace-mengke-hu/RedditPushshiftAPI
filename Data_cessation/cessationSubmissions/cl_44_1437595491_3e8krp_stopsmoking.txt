I think I'm ready to finally quit cigarettes; should I give up weed as well?

Hello, r/stopsmoking

23 years old, I started smoking when I was 18 years old, but only smoked socially and never bought packs. Around my 21st birthday (when I started smoking weed), I started smoking a pack of cigs a day. The folks at /r/electronic_cigarette have provided me with great information regarding vaping. Whenever I have my ecig, I don't crave cigs at all. I have quit for up to a month at a time but I used to always start up again, but not anymore.

I am tired of smoking. I am tired of waking up coughing. I am tired of spending all of my money at 7/11 supporting Phillip Morris.

Should I stop smoking weed as well? I'm only a casual user, but often times when I toke I want to follow up with a cig. Should I quit for a short while (maybe a month or so) then see what happens? Thanks in advance.

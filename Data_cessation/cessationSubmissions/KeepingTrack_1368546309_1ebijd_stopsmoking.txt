Day 4 of Quitting

I switched to vaping (e-cigarette). I'd had friends and in-laws tell me it was good and I'd like it. I didn't buy it, bought a disposable NJoy, burned through it in 10 hours, took my last $100-ish and went and bought some gear.

My setup below doesn't include everything I bought, just the items I'm using constantly. 

The Halo Purity tribeca's great (30 ml of 18mg). I bought a Kanger Protank (with some replacement atomizers) and an adjustable joyetech Ego C Twist. Not the best rig, but not the bottom of the barrel either. I bought that and some of the chinese Strawberry (18 mg strength, again, 30 mls) and I'm happy. Day 4 is almost over for me. I wish they'd had 24mg locally, but I'm alright with 18mg now. I'll probably but some 24mg later though.

Yes, I'm now addicted to the pen. But you know what? I'm no longer coughing. I've been smoking since I was 12. I'm 31 now. I've been smoking heavily since I was about 19, around a pack a day. I guarantee I'm taking in less nicotine and other chemicals now than I was then. I'd be okay with vaping the rest of my life and wish this'd been this available and mature of a technology when I was 18.

I hope I'll not suffer any health issues because of my smoking, but at least now I'll not have as much damage as if I'd continued smoking the rest of my life.

I've had one cigar since that 4 days started because my battery ran out of juice and had to charge for 4 hours. I didn't inhale but once and now I'm going to buy another couple of batteries.

Crashed and burned

I quit smoking about a month and a half ago and have been doing pretty well. Then wife decided to start a fight over some stupid shit and I got stressed out with work and now I am back....

I know these are just excuses, but really I feel like I just don't have any strength in me to continue the fight. Plus, problems with concentration and agitation made it impossible to work. I am thinking what to do next? Been having about 5 a day for the last few days as opposed to a pack a day before. Smoked for about 10 years?

Any advice? Should I try to get the gum, patch? Some folks advise vaping, but I am not sure. 

Fuck man, I was doing good for a while too.

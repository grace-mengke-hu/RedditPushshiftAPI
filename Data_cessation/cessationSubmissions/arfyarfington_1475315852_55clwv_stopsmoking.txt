Day 1 (first day 1 ever, never tried quitting before)

And I'm bloody terrified to eat, because I don't know how to eat without having a fag after. 
I'm having my morning coffee (no cig in hand!) And a biscuit and it struck me the moment I ate it, shit, I wanna smoke.

So instead I've come to this sub to write a post.you may be seeing a wee bit of me now, sorry.

How do you deal with the lack of post meal cigs?

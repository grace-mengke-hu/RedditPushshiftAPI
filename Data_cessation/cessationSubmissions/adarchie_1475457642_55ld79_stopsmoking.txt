24 hours achieved

I have reached the 24 hour mark since my last cigarette. Praying I can continue to be strong. My husband is a smoker but I have managed to not give in and join him. If I can make it one day I can make it another.....worried how I will be at work this week.....but trying to remind myself to take it one day at a  time....for myself, for my kids, for my husband.....

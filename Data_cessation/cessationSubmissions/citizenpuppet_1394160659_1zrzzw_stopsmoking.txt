Just finished Allen Carr's book

Has anyone else felt like the message behind what he was saying about smoker culture apply to a lot of other ideas in life. Toward the end, I was thinking about alcohol, coffee, marijuana (smoking) and realized that they taste bad. Sure, a glass of wine paired with a good meal can enhance the experience, but whisky tastes bad. Coffee tastes bad. Tea tastes good. Smoking weed tastes like shit. I feel like the book's message is pretty profound, to go out and have fun living life.

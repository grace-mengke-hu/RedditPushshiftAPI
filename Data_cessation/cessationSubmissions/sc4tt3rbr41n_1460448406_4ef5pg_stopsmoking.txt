I haven't smoked in 48 hours

Please tell me I can do this. I've been going through a rough time this past week. Decided to run this morning to distract me from cravings and it worked for a few hours. Now I've already had dinner and I'm just waiting until it's time to go to bed. Feeling really down and the cravings are really strong.

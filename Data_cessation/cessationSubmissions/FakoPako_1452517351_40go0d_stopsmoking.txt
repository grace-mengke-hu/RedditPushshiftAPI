NEW YEARS QUITTERS! Week #2!

WOOT WOOT WOOT! Hope everyone had a great smoke free weekend! I did! It was awesome. I went to the gym early Saturday morning, walked/ran on the treadmill. It felt awesome. I have to say that I didn't have cravings at all, that I can remember. It feels soooo good not to smoke. My clothes don't smell, my car doesn't stink anymore. I don't have to go out and freeze my ass off! My gas station card that I was using for gas, smokes and redbull also likes it! lol...

I have to say, the amount of energy that I have is amazing! I never woke up so early in the morning like I do now. It's awesome!  This is by far the longest I went. Plus, I didn't have a sip of RedBull this year! Just water and coffee. Feels damn good!

Hope everyone is doing good!!!! Keep it up kids.. week 2 here we gooooooooooooo!!!!!!

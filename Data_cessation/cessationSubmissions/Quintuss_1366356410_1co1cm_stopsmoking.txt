Third time quitting - 13 days in and all over it.

This is my third time quitting, and this is the last time i'm going to quit.  In the last 13 days, 18 hours and 21 minutes i've saved 247 Australian dollars, and not smoked 275.31 cigarettes.  I feel great.

I'm a non-smoker now, and I can control my own smoking destiny. That's what I keep telling myself.  Yesterday was a bit of a test - I was at a work leaving-do, lots of alcohol was had, and everyone was smoking.  All the casual smokers were out, and I got offered a cigarette several times by one colleague in particular. I think they thought I would cave.

It reached the stage where I purposely went outside to where everyone was smoking so I could stay in the conversations - and I completely resisted smoking.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't crave a few puffs, especially after all the alcohol, but I said to myself "fuck this, you're not a smoker, you don't want that shit" and I refused to let myself slip up.

I'm not going to quit again, i'm in it for the long haul.  Stay strong folks, the more you quit the easier it gets.

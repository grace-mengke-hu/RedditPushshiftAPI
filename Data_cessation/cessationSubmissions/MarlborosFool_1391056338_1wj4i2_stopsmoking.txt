Patient smells tobacco on my sleeves after receiving a nice little smoking cessation talk .... from me.

So.....Time to kick this weak-sauce habit. 

Any advice from students who smoke to relieve study related stress?
I know this is going to be a harsh month, but anything that might take the edge off would be nice. 

I've told everyone in my life, picked up some nicotine gum, and I already work out to kill stress. 

I assume you guys have seen this situation a million times, so any gems for a newbie?

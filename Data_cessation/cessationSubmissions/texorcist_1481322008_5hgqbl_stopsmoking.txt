Your gonna have to learn how to shit again. Or at least I did...

Quit 1/1/2016, relapsed, quit again 10/1/2016. Both time had amazingly bad constipation.

I didn't realize how much cigarettes kept me regular. Had coffee and a smoke in the morning: boom! After quitting both times, had a rough time.

I would recommend the following to those about to join the ranks of ex-smokers: water, Align, Metamucil.

Get a cool water bottle to tote around when you quit. Get a Yeti tumbler, you deserve it, quitter. Align is a daily probiotic and softens stool. Metamucil provides the fiber to keep things moving.

Recommend doing this when you pick your quit date, at least a week before. After you quit, might be too late to make an impact.

Onward!

Pun intended.

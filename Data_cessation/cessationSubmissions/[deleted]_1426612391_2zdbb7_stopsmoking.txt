Having a tough time of it. Day 3.

 I found this subreddit a couple days ago. After 25 years of smoking, I decided to stop. After reading here and following some links I was really excited to quit

 The first couple of days were hard. Really hard. The cravings were intense. So was my anxiety. Today though and a bit last night I noticed my throat was getting sore. My ears are ringing a bit. My anxiety is very intense. I am aware of my tongue. I am easily frustrated and I have a headache. My cravings are often. And my sleep was very light. 

 I never read about withdrawal symptoms other than the strong cravings and anxiety. After a quick google search this morning it seems there are quite a few really negative symptoms. Some I have that I listed above and some I thankfully dont have. 

I guess I shouldnt have been so naive as to think it would just be cravings. Cravings I can deal. But losing sleep, headache, ear sensitivity, anxiety, sore throat. I really wasnt prepared. Any help would be great.

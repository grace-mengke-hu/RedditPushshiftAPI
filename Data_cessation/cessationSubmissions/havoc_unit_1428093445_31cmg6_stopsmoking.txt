I met with a friend I hadn't seen in a couple of years

He's been my friend for about a decade, and we used to smoke and drink together since always. We met yesterday - last time he saw me I was still a smoker - and went for a couple of beers, before leaving the bar he proceeds to light up and offered a smoke. He knows I quit, he also quit but smokes socially, so he sees no harm in it and offered it without ill intention. 


I was very tempted, it has been almost a year and half, and all in all, it has been a very clean quit without doubts or lots of temptations (after the first month, that is). Thoughts rushed in about how "one won't make any harm" and "I'm so over the addiction, I can handle it"; and then other thoughts I didn't expect at all, I remembered this sub and all the stories I've read about how "just one" turned to a pack a day again, how easy it's to fall back into full mode addiction. I remembered my badge, and all the threads of people who reset their badges because of "only one" at a party.


I accompanied my friend while he smoked, we kept talking and inside I was just so happy I turned it down and didn't give in to the "just one". 

I'm sure social smoking works for some ex-smokers, such as my pal, but I can't see that working for me. 

I want to thank to everybody who posts to this sub, even when I'm not that active posting. I didn't realize how important seeing all of your stories has been for my own success, because I quit just a couple of months before I stumbled upon this place, but let me assure you that /r/stopsmoking is a great place to check if you want to stay quit. Thank you all, guys!

I feel like a dog.

I quit smoking a month and a half ago after smoking for 12 years. I had a mild sinus and throat infection for past 2 months(I would take Advil and it would subside for a few days before coming back). It was never too bad to force me go to the doctor but this saturday, I got fever and I decided to pay a visit to Mr Bolourian. He prescribed antibiotics which have almost cured my infection. 

Today I realized that my sense of smell is off the charts. I can smell and appreciate every fucking thing around me. Every room I go to, it smells different than other room. I feel like a dog. What a life! I wish I had done this sooner. Guys, do it, you wont regret it.

Two Weeks In!

And I'm feeling pretty awesome. Yesterday I only really had one craving of probably medium strength. I keep telling myself... if you have one you are throwing all those smoke-free days away and you're going to have to start over again. Not worth it. I did Chantix and only a half dose, and quit that after about a week and a half. I'm taking my new awesome lungs for a jog this evening :)

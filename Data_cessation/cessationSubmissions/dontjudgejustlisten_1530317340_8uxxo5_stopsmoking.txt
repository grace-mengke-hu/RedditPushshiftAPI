I’m on day 2, the gas station is evil, trying to get my sex game back up.

I’ve smoked since I was 17 or so, I’m 26 now. I decided to quit because I stopped a few years ago for about 6 months and I was way better in bed. Yes, that’s why I’m primarily stopping, because I ejaculate rather quickly in bed now. It’s not stupid fast, but fast enough for me to stop. When I stopped originally, I could go for forever. Women aren’t really bothered by it but last week, a chick giggled a bit and it was a super blow to my ego. Oof. I’m excellent in bed, so good at four-play that I can get away with busting nuts pretty quickly. And although she didn’t care - we still hook up - the giggle was brutal.  There are of course other reasons but this was a big one lol.  I realize how silly this all is as I type it but this will be a good start to what I’m trying to accomplish in not only my sex life, but for my health. 

Anyway, I was at the gas station and holy shit. It’s intense. I was buying gas but boy oh boy did I want a pack. I sat there determining a drink for like 5 minutes because I was debating on whether I wanted the smokes. I felt like Seth in Superbad when he wants to buy the alcohol but has that fucked up vision and pussy’s out. I got a Gatorade and got the fuck out of there. It was over pretty fast (ironic) and I kept that giggle in my mind. Literally burned into my skull. Anyway, I have this woman to thank for my journey into lasting longer and living healthier. But fuck gas stations. I’ve read in this sub about using my card and such at the pump instead of going in but I was legit thirsty. I also cut out coffee because it makes me want smokes. 

Any-who, stay strong and keep trucking. It honestly doesn’t suck as badly as I thought it would. Whenever you have that moment of clarity take it. No matter what it be. And stick with it. Otherwise you’ll cum quick, or maybe you won’t :). Love y’all and thanks for this sub. 

Deuces.

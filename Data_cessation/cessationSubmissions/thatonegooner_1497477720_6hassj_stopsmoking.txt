Day 0 of my fifth attempt to quit smoking

Hi all.

I started smoking 3 years ago as a freshman in college. Escalated from 2-4 smokes a day to a pack a day very quickly. I only had a break from smokes when I went home for vacations and even then I would find a way to sneak 2 or 3 in a day. I'd go back to a pack a day as soon as I wan back in university.

Now I'm done with college and I've come home and reduced to 5 smokes a day. Lately, I have been having hard times with cough, throat pain and also ear pain. Some websites indicate that this may be because of oral cancer.  Although I'm mostly sure that it's not cancer, I've been sufficiently scared to try my fifth attempt (and hopefully my last) to quit.

Never used reddit the other times that I tried to quit and looking at all you helpful folks going through the same thing gives me a lot of hope.

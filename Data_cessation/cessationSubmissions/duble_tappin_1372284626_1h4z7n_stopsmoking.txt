Keep Going, You can do it!

I am at 194 days, no relapses been around smokers, been drunk, been in all situations where a smoke would have been great but powered through and have been clean for a long time it feels like. If I can do this then I know most can as well. It sucks for a bit but turns to the point where you see no reason to start again. If you find a trigger for me it is arguing with my wife, or working on cars with her dad find something that fill that 'void'. I used either gum or candy that would last for a bit till I forgot that I wanted one.
TL;DR: You can do it just find another filler for when you think you need a smoke.

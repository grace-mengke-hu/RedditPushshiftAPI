Reset my badge. Knew I was going to start again.

I'm back on this sub after smoking again for about 6 weeks. I had made it to 70 days and then fell off the wagon again. To be honest I had almost premeditated restarting after 70 days, almost from the very beginning of my quit because I know that that's the longest I'e ever been.

Does anyone else premeditate a restart date and unconsciously work towards it?

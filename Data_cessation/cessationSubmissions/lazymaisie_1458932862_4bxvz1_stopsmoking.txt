Today's my day.

I've been prepping to quit smoking for a while now. I originally set my quit date for tomorrow, the 26th, but I finished my pack this morning. I go through half a pack a day, and I didn't feel like stopping on my way to work. Two of my coworkers are smokers but they're gone today, so I'm not bumming anything off of them. 

I've decided to move my quit day up to today. I'm going for a run after work and have decided to use Lozenges as a NRT for when the cravings get really bad. 

What is some advice you have as I start my new, healthier life?

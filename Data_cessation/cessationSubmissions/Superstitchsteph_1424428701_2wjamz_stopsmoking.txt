I quit Day 19

Woop woop! I stopped smoking 19 days ago, yay me! 
This is my first reddit post so be kind! I am using the smoke free app for iPhone and I would definitely recommend it. It gives you a daily mission to complete and today's is to post on here all of the methods I have used to stop. So here goes:
1. Smoke free app - it give you space to diarise my thoughts
2. Vaping- this has really helped when cravings have come on strong
3. Repeating the mantra 'not one more puff, no matter what' has reinforced my desire to stop
4. My fianc√© and I have done this together. The support of each other has really helped plus the understanding of mood swings 
5. Changing my routine- I have worked more exercise into my life and now drink less coffee
6. Putting money in a jar- I didn't spend a lot on smoking, but watching the wedding fund slowly build is great
7. Not worrying about food- I know I have put on weight already but one thing at a time

Any one else got any other things to try?

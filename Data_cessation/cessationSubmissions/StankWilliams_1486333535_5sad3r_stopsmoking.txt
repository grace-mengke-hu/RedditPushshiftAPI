Using multiple 7 mg nicotine patches at the same time?

Tried to quit smoking a few months ago, bought the 7 mg patches thinking that they'd be enough. Stupid idea seeing as how I smoke a shitload and obviously needed stronger patches. Relapsed and am now trying to quit again. Still have the 7 mg patches from before and don't have money to buy more patches right now. Can I just wear 2 or 3 of these patches at a time to equal 14 or 21 mgs of nicotine or is that unsafe for some reason?

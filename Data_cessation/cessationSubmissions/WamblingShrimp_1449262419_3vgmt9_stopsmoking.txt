Day 1...Again

Hi all! New here and back on day one of my LAST EVER quit. I'm done trying to quit, I am quitting! I have smoked around a pack a day for 9 years and have had several prior quits, the longest being 4 months. 

Today I prepared for work with a nicotine patch, 3 packs of gum (1 Big Reg, 2 different mints), a big bag of sunflower seeds and have spent my ~~smoke~~ breaks cleaning out my car. Yes, I brought my handheld vacuum to work with me...

6.5 hours down! What are your tips for getting through the first few days??

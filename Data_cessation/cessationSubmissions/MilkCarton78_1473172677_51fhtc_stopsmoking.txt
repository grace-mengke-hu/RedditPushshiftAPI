Had a dream that I started smoking again

I had a dream last night that I was at a cookout with friends who were smoking and I said, "It's been almost three months, and I can make that all go away right now!" And I did. 

Even though it was a dream I could feel the weight of disappointment having to start back again at zero all because of a poor decision. Fuck smoking guys - we're all much better without.

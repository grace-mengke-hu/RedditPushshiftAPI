Day 6 is tomorrow. Here are some changes/things I noticed.

- the tips of my fingers and toes now get warm and stay soft, is line I get a feeling in them

- my senses of smell has gotten better. I smell my office now and it really smells clean. Nothing changed except me your smoking so I know my senses of smell is improving


- my sinuses are clearer, still a little stuffed up but definitely clearer


- I ate 2 piece fried chicken lunch from Ralph's that I eat from time to time, and oh boy it was salty, barely eatable. I think I'm starting to taste things better again.


- I still have mild chest pains, hope these disappear soon


- I get incredible urge to smoke for a few minutes up to half an hour, 2-3 times a day. I thought about getting a vape today it got that bad, but i didn't, not yet.


- I can't sleep. I was literally passed out for 3 days (sun, mon, Tue) and couldn't move. But I can't sleep at night. Last night I slept about 2 hours. Surprisingly though today was a first day when I had a lot of energy. Maybe this will regulate soon. It's 1:15, I need to be up in 5.5 hours but I'm still up.


- I'm worried about next weekend. I have a camping trip and I know there will be smokers there and whiskey. I hope I won't relapse.


- I miss having smoke breaks and puffing around for a few minutes.

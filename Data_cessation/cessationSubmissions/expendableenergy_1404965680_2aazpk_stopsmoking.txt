I feel like a garbage disposal. help!

SO i am on day two. instead of smoking ive been eating, and eating, and eating, and eating. I need something else because i dont want to gain any weight (ive been on a journey to lose about 60 lbs so far! quitting is my next step in becoming healthy.). Is this something that will pass in a couple of days? Halp i dont want to go back to smoking in fear of getting fat.

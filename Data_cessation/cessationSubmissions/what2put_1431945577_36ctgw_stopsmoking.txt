Ok ladies and gents, how long until I am no longer sleeping beauty?

Yesterday I spent at least 15 hours in bed. I pass out really fast and get really great sleep but I never wake up with energy. I know sleeping a lot is my body's way of healing, but how much longer until I wake up and feel normal?

I'm on day 9. Also, I quit drinking (diet) soda 25 days ago, so no caffeine. i was a bit sleepy before quitting smoking, but now it's ridiculous.  Anyone else dealing with this?

I did see my doctor last week and she's supposed to call me this week with blood test results from my check up.

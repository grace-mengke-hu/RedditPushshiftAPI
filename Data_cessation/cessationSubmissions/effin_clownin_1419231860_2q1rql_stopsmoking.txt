New Years Resolution to Quit Smoking

I originally had the idea to just switch to E cigs for 2015 but changed my mind and spent my e cig money on other things:

* 6 pack of Listerine (get that smoker breath out)
* Clair air purifier (cute air purifier my gf recommended)
* 12 pack of aquafresh whitening (ima brush 4 times a day)
* All my coats dry cleaned
* Johnny Walker Blue label (to keep me happy during those tough first couple of weeks)

I am still smoking until December 31st, but I hope this lil gift package to myself is the lil boost I needed all along. Wish me luck!

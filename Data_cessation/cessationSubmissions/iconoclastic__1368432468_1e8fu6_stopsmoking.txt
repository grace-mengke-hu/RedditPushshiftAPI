Basic Guide? FAQ? Sidebar-like material?

Does this subreddit have an essential reading list on effective ways to quit smoking? I'm talking frequently asked questions, or guides for frequently repeated suggestions/guides.


For example:
*  e.g. what is cold turkey? Is it effective? 
* Nicotine patches: what you should know
* success stories



I'm looking more for factual, time-tested information on the best ways to quit smoking more so than an active support group (which is what a lot of this subreddit seems to be for. Which is awesome, but isn't quite what I'm after).


Any suggestions? Thanks

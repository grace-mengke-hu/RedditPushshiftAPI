Slowly but surely quitting all the things

Alright so 153 days ago I quit drinking. I always smoked while drinking, and only smoked a few cigs a day if I was sober, but I drank daily for like 2 years so I smoked a lot. Anyway, once I quit drinking I started smoking a lot more. Weed and cigs. I didn't even like smoking either of them. Cigarettes mostly grossed me out and weed made me paranoid, but I could feel myself getting more and more addicted to cigarettes. Smoking first thing in the morning and going way out of my way to get cigarettes if I ran out. My dad smokes and I've watched him struggle to quit his whole life. It KILLS him seeing me smoking. 

I wasn't feeling great today, but I would still smoke and feel even worse. Gagging and stuff while forcing myself to smoke. After work I smoked a cigarette and had this "ugh why the hell do I do this" thought. I looked up and saw a homeless guy picking cigarette butts off the ground and smoking them. I was like fuck this I'm DONE and went up to the guy and asked if he wanted them. He was ECSTATIC. He said thank you over and over and I saw him open the pack, realize it was pretty much a full pack, and he was just like so happy he was jumping around. He said thanks a few more times before walking away all pumped. It felt sooo good to make his day like that while also getting rid of the cigarettes. I'm not fully addicted to cigs, but I know it's going to take some willpower not to buy some, but I'm going to apply the same method that worked to get me to quit drinking. 

Also quit weed on Saturday, which I'm feeling good about. I think this is real this time. Feels real. I can't wait to get healthy. 

Fuck ya sobriety for making this possible and enabling me to start bettering myself.

Insecure

Four months-ish since my last cigarette - I found for me, not keeping track is helpful towards thwarting temptation.  But realized a bit ago I'm over 100 days for sure, so happy about that!

I stopped drinking soon-after quitting, and recently am trying to cut out sugar.  But then, while at an Emmy's party and finding myself eating anything I could in company - I realized, I'm just whack-a-moling "addictions" because I'm treating the effects.  And after some quick digging, I find I don't have an addiction issue with these other things as much as an insecurity problem - when alone, I'm fine, but when in company I think I need all this "stuff" to make me interesting and worthy of company.

And it hurts.  So bad.  So after and despite months of successful smoke-freeness - all of a sudden I want one.  It will make this hurt go away.  It will fix everything.

I know it won't - and I remember that I was hurt, even when smoking.  But damn, it was a friend I could count on.

Too bad I know that it will make me smell like shit, no matter how "helpful", and make my throat feel awful.  And so getting through it.  But just needed to vent, and hope to get some support.  Xo.

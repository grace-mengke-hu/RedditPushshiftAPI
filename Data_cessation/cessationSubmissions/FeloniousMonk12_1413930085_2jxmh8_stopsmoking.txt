Quitting cigars

Hi all, just wanted to introduce myself.  I gave up smoking cigarettes (2 packs/day) about 7 years ago.  About 4 years ago I foolishly started smoking cigars (about 2 per day).  Granted, I didn't inhale the cigars, but I got plenty of second-hand smoke as well as trans-dermal nicotine through my oral mucosa.  About a week ago I decided to taper off cigars.  Smoked my last one yesterday around 4pm.  I hope it won't be as difficult as it was quitting cigarettes.  Wish me luck!

I stopped smoking [Weed] about a week and a half ago, and I don’t feel normal.

So this is my second time I’ve stopped smoking weed Cold Turkey. 

The first time was last spring, May 23 2017, and I didn’t smoke again until January 16 2018. When I stopped I never truly felt back to “normal” I’ve always felt I was at 85% and never 100%. I didn’t feel myself. 

Now I’ve stopped again April 23, and I’ll be stopping for a while. I used to Vape a lot too, but now it’s been about a week and a half, and I woke up feeling the same Foggy, Tingly, not 100%. Is it because it’s not all out of my system? 

When I stopped before, even when I was clean (I was sober for 7 months) it still kinda lingered, I still couldn’t feel like my normal self.

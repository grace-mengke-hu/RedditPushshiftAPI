2 weeks tonight at 12pm

tonight at 12 est it will be exactly 2 weeks since my last cig after smoking for 10 years and im so stoked about it.
advice i can offer thats gotten me this far:
-download the smokefree app, gamifying my quitting really helped me personally. i check it everyday to see my updated stats which are tremendously encouraging 
- stay away from places were people smoke, went to a couple bars in the past two weeks and it was brutal.
- tell everyone you know you're quitting, they will be so happy for you and won't mind your bragging ;)

last but not least when you have a craving remind yourself why you're quitting and that the little toddler in your head isn't you. its the nicotine and it doesn't fight fair. eventually IT DOES GET EASIER.

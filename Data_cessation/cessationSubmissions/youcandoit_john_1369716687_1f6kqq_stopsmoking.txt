Just reached 72 hours of not smoking! I'm both proud and miserable

As the title describes, I now haven't had a cigarette in three days. I'm proud of that accomplishment, but all I want is to smoke. When I'm around people it's fine, I'm not thinking about it, no problems. But as soon as I'm alone, as I am now, I just want a cigarette and nothing else.

When does this stop? Also, when am I going to stop hating everyone around me?
This subreddit has helped me get this far, I'm hoping y'all can help me get through this battle!

1 Down 11 to Go!

Hit 1 month today! So happy with myself! No regrets, no looking back. Ever time I saw someone light up, or smoking in the last month, just kept telling myself, "I don't do that. I am a Nonsmoker." Even if a couple of times it was hard, I got past it. My taste is back, and my sense of smell is back. Amazing how strong some things smell.

Good luck to everyone who is still working towards your 1 month. You will make it happen, as long as you don't smoke again.

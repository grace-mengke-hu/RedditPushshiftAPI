Finally did it. It's only been a day but feel like the hardest part of is over.

Been talking about it, read the Alan's book, and kept waiting for some magical moment.  I don't even know how I picked when I did but I stopped smoking Sunday at noon.  I've had a small handful of urges (the worst was getting in the car, heading back to work after lunch) but am surprised they haven't been as bad as I expected.  In fact it has me a little anxious because I'm thinking I haven't experienced the worst of it yet.  I don't know why but I feel real confident; like going back is not an option.  I know you're supposed to tell everyone to hold yourself accountable, but I haven't ... I can't wait to casually say to my friends and family, "Oh I quit a while ago."

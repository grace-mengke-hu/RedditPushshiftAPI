I'm done with it. It starts today!

Hi.
I've been a smoker for at least 7 years, and so far, i can only see bad things about it.
Comparing myself to others, i feel weaker, under controll, broken, i feel i have a mind with less "clarity".. And on top of that, my last 6 months have been like shit. I stop for a week, and that mentality of "one will not hurt you" appears, and i smoke for one more week. And then i go back again, and the cicle goes on and on.
I came to the conclusion that im a little shit with no self-control. This thing of stop smoking feels like an apocalyptic war that lasts forever..
But then i found this subreddit, and i started reading your stories. What is brutal about it, is that you guys went through the same things that i'm trying to get over! And it gave me the power to make the final decision! Because in the end, most smokers wont quit for three reasons:

 **1) They can't imagine their life without smoking** 

**2) They don't want to go through the process of quitting** 

**3) They think they are alone on their decision.**

I'm really thankful for this subreddit!

**Thank you all.**

Help I've gone numb

I thought by now I'd be feeling better but instead I'm getting worse. I'm not craving or having withdrawals but I feel like crap. I haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks and my body feels like it's falling apart. Mentally I'm not depressed but at the same time there's no excitement, no joy, no happiness, etc. Also seems my libido has gone to hell. I expected things to be messed up early on but why am I still going sideways instead of getting better?

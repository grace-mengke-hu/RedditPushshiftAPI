What to do with my pack of cigarettes? 3 days clean

I’ve been smoke free for 3 days.

I have half a pack of cigarettes in one of my purses in my closet. I haven’t touched it since quitting, but when I get really intense cravings, it starts calling my name.

The reason I haven’t gotten rid of it yet is well... a few reasons. 

First, I was worried that looking at it or holding the pack in my hands would trigger me. In the first few days I thought I wouldn’t be strong enough to go through with it. So, I thought it would be better if I just didn’t touch it or look at it AT ALL in the first few days. It’s worked so far, but I think it’s time to take the next step.

Second, I’m not sure how to get rid of them in a way that makes them gone for good. If I simply threw them in the bin, I could always just take them out. Who knows how I can get rid of them forever?

Third, I live across the street from a 24 hour gas station. Getting rid of my pack would just make it so that I have to go through an extra step if I want to smoke. It wouldn’t take away my access entirely. Because of that, I thought it wasn’t worth doing until I was absolutely sure that the act of getting rid of them wouldn’t cause more harm by triggering me than it’s worth.

After 3 days of not smoking I feel like I’m finally confident that I can get rid of my pack without getting tempted to relapse. How can I do this in a way that makes them unusable, rather than simply moving them from my purse to my trash can?

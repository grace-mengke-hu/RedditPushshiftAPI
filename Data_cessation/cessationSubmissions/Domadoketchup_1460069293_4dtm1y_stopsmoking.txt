4 days smoke free. Seeing health benefits already!

So i tested my heart rate. When i used to smoke my heart rate avaraged at like 75. Now it avarages around 55. I also get way less exhausted when exercising and i dont feel the need for some extra air when i chased a bus or ran up the stairs.  I feel like living again. FUCK THEM FUCKING STICKS OF CANCER! Yall can do it, i believe in you. Even though its only been 4 days for me, im determined!

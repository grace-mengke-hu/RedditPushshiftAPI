Starting over after 3 months +

I can't fucking believe it. 105 days and I relapsed. Got too drunk and decided to hit my friends vape over and over. I'm ashamed of myself. I thought I had this. Clearly, I was mistaken. Don't give in guys. It's a day to day battle. I believe in you, I believe that you won't make the same stupid mistake I did.

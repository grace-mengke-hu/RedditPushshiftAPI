Checking in, Day 9

After I quit cold turkey, there were a few moments were I craved cigarettes. the first three days were horrible. That's why I chose a Friday to quit, because otherwise I am near people and they have to be around someone who behaves like an ass because of his addiction.

After those few days, however, it became really easy. I only smoked cigarettes for a year, maybe that's why. Or it is because of my (somewhat irregular) meditation sessions, or because I've already tried to quit god knows how often in the last two months.

Anyway, I don't feel a need to smoke anymore. I'm currently drunk, and it's just not there. I dreamed about smoking yesterday, but it was only confusing when I woke up. No nostalgia, no need, nothing. Kinda funny because it was so vivid, I woke up and wondered if it happened for real.

Anyway: positive outlook is maintained, future is looking good.

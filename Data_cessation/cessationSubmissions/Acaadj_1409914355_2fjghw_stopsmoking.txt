Just my morning post for all you quitters!

First of all. I'm on day 3. woooooo. I can breathe this morning. I like this.

Second of all.. if you're thinking about quitting, but not quite sure... I realized that this forum was what I needed. Give these guys a try. Tell people that you're quitting. I get messages all day from friends that I didn't even know cared. I figure if I can make it through the first 24 hours, I can do anything!

Third:: to all the quitters who have made it far, but are experiencing wanting to smoke. DO NOT UNDO ALL THAT WORK YOU HAVE DONE. I am so proud of each one of you, whether it's 10 days or 100. You are my motivation. You are my role models. Please do not pick up that cigarette. I'm looking up to you.

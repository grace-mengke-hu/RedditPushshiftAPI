Questions about exercising while quitting.

I am quitting cigarettes after over 10 years smoking 1 to 2 packs a day. The pack I have is my last. My questions however are about exercising while quitting. Is it going to be easier to exercise right away? How about a day or week after? I've been trying to get into shape lately and cutting these death sticks has to be a huge benefit, but when will I notice it. Currently I can only play one game of 21 in basketball without feeling like dying. I'm going to use that to measure my progress. Any thoughts.  

Also, if someone could link that book everyone talks about that would be awesome. I checked the side bar and didn't see it.

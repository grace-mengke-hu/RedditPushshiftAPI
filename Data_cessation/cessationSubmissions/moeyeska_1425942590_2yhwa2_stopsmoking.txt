My brain

So I went the store to go buy some clothes today and right after I paid and got my change I thought, oh wait do I have enough for a pack of cigarettes? My mind brought me back to how I used to think but only for just a second. Then I thought wait a minute I'm not a smoker and I was so relieved as I'm happy I'm not a smoker

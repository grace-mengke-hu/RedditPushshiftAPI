Well, day 22 can just go to hell then.

Today has been the absolute hardest day since I quit and the past ten minutes is the closest I have come to throwing it all away and lighting one up. 

I'm just venting, and I'm not going to smoke because I refuse to go through this all over again, but seriously....I don't understand why my quit feels so much more difficult (and downright exhausting) all of a sudden.

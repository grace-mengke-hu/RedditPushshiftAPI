Quit smoking for 8 days mild anxiety won't go away.

Hello,  


I am looking into some insight regarding a mild anxiety around my solarus plexus/stomach area.  
I believe it is related to quiting-smoking, but I could be wrong. Has anyone else experienced this?  
And when does it go away? It is not intense anxiety, it is a mild anxiety that lasts throughout the day.

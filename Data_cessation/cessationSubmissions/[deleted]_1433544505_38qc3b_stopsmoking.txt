In Las Vegas...(dear Lord help me)...

I know it's going to seem naive that I didn't expect this, but: my wife and I had a trip to Vegas planned since before I quit. Now I'm here, with 10 days abstinent from cigarettes, and, well...I'm kinda freaking out. (I haven't smoked, but I kinda can't believe that).

Here are the major problems:
1. I HATE Vegas. I hate loud volumes, crappy food, I don't drink or gamble (not a Puritan, that's just me)...in short, I totally resent the environment I'm in, and for me, resentment = trigger. 
2. Obviously, there's lots of people smoking everywhere. This is a weird, paradoxical trigger, because: on the one hand, breathing in people's secondhand smoke is grossing me out/pissing me off...but on the other hand, the constant visual cues are definitely fucking with me. 
3. Cigs are cheaper here (I live in NYC), and I have that "I'm not at home" feeling, which is tempting me to justify smoking. 

As I said above, I haven't smoked, and MOST of me doesn't want to, but...today has just sucked. 

Sorry to moan and complain...just had to get this out. Thanks.

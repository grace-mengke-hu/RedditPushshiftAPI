Day 2

Yesterday was just fine. Went the entire day with very little to no frustration or jitters, just focused on doing little projects around the house and listening to various records on my little turntable. I was feeling pretty optimistic about quitting. Now, today. Jesus H. FUCKING Christ I don't think I've ever been angrier in my life. Every little thing has set me off. I've screamed at my dog. I've come very close to breaking and throwing things. I'm at my parent's house in the country, miles from the nearest town so I wouldn't have to deal with things that normally frustrate me like traffic, people, etc., but I keep hitting little bumps in the road, so to speak. My project from yesterday was a failure. My dog shit on the carpet. Just little stuff, you know? 
Could anyone give me advice/words of wisdom? Because a smoke sounds SO NICE about now....

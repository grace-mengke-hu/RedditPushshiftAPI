How do i get past the panic attacks?

I Vaped 35mg all day and went straight to 6 cigarettes a day. Each day I smoked one less now I'm down to 4 a day.

I get cravings after 2 hours but I can go 6 hours without a cigarette now, but I start getting really bad panic attacks.

For example, today I went about 4 hours without smoking at work, then I started feeling out of it which is normal after some time. Then my breathing felt very shallow. I know what the withdrawals feel like so I wasn't worried. Then it just felt like I drank 2 cups of coffee, vision was getting blurry and I was getting very dizzy. I already had panic attacks so I know how to calm down, but this was my body not my mind reacting.

Smoked a cigarette and felt fine, and that is why the only thing that is stopping me from quitting completely.

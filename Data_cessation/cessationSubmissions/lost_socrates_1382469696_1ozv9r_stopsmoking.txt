So I started a vice jar...

I figured up that smoking was costing me around 2500 a year.  Add that to boozing, and buying lottery tickets like an idiot, and its a ton of wasted cash.  So... now  I'm keeping a vice jar at the house... if I'm at the store and want smokes, I pull 7 bucks out and put it in my back pocket to go in the jar later... same with money for lotto tickets, or the extra couple of bucks for that last beer that I probably don't need anyway.   I'm still very addicted to all of my vices, but at this point I'm also getting addicted to putting the money in the jar.   When I slip up and have a smoke, I put 10 bucks in so I'll realize what I'm wasting.  The goal is to have enough at the end of the year to take my family to disneyland, or on a cruise... I'll keep you all posted on how its going if you'd like.  If you wanna join me and start your own, please do, and keep me posted on your progress.  Good luck !

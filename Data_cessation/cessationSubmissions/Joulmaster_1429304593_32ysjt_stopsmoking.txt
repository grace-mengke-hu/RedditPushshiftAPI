Traveling through Limbo

I'm sitting here drinking my morning coffee kind of reflecting on my quit. Every now and then I get the craving, and at this point it's become something of a wet noodle, slapping me but doing no damage, a Christmas carol ghost who I know has no powers but still thinks its funny to bother me. And this I guess is just a kind of recap, but also a comparison because, something is off. I don't feel "super happy" I guess I should say. After 2 months so far I'm starting to realize what forever means, not in a numerical or chronological way, but what it means in day to day experience. 

It's been quite the emotional roller coaster so far. I've gone from moments of walking outside actually smelling the cold roasted pine. I've made love to my girlfriend and just generally felt better, cleaner, more stamina. All of which compound on themselves to make you feel even better. The more you think about where you were the more you feel like an ex-stockholm syndrome prisoner. 

And in more ways than one. You feel violated, tainted internally by those pollutants.  

And I sit here kind of assessing how I felt at that last cigarette, A cig I subconsciously rushed through, Power hits. Simultaneously gorging myself on the chemical casserole and trying to hurry it, to get away from it faster. Loving and hating at the same time. Throwing it away halfway through because I can't even catch my breath. 

So ya it lingers, the memories, the trauma of polluting myself. But I'm going to keep on going, in all its complicated weirdness and uncomfortable states of mind, I really don't see myself smoking ever again :).

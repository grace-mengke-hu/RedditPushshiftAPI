48 Hours no craving and symptoms , I already feel i am on the downhill

I have been smoking for 6 years now , have tried to quit so many times but always failed.This time before quiting i consistently practiced meditiation for 3-4 hours daily for a week as i knew from past attempts that without controlling the mind it is not possible to quit smoking for me and i think it has worked.I have not had a single urge to light up.I cannot tell how happy i am right now.It feels like all those years were filled with illusion of having ciggrates as an answer to everything.I am never gonna light up my next "Just One cigarette". 

Thanks to all the posts on [r/stopsmoking](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/) as it was the reason i joined reddit and for all the resources made available. I love everyone

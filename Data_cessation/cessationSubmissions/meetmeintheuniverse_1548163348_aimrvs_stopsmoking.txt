Had a really rough 8th day. Just slipped up.

I had a few glasses of wine and figured I’d let myself just give in. Rolled the tiniest cigarette I possibly could and I smoked it.

I’ve gone cold turkey so far and don’t want to start smoking at all again but the cravings and the little voice in my head got the best of me.

How do I react to this? I absolutely am not waking up as a smoker tomorrow but I feel like I’ve failed and my 8 day streak has been reset.

Does it work like this in regards to my physical cravings? Now that I have introduced nicotine again are my cravings gonna get worse?

Anyone slipped up like this? (Probably a silly question, but any help or advice would be appreciated)

Cheers.

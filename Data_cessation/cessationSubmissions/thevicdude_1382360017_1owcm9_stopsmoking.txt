Trying once more.

Started smoking again a couple weeks ago...

I've had such an on-off relationship with smoking, I'm able to quit for months and I am usually way better off without it. I love to physically active things, and I don't see the point in exerting myself when I'm a smoker. I've been stuck in a rut lately and I need to get out of my newly reaquired smoking habit. I need to nip this in the bud before I let it become my new 'regular'.

Thanks for listening, I wish the best to all of you!

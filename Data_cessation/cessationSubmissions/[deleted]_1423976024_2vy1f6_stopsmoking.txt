Can anyone give me advice for dealing with food?

Obviously as we all know stopping smoking often comes with lots of overeating due to the oral fixation. I quit cold turkey just over 2 months ago and while I am very proud of how good I've been doing, I am NOT proud of the way I've been eating.  I used to have thoughts that revolved around, "when am I going to get my next cigarette?" Now I am constantly thinking about what I'm going to eat next. I've gained a few pounds, nothing super noticeable, but I feel disgusting and want to stop this now.

When it first started I told myself not to worry about overeating because the important thing was to focus on my quit. I also rationalized with, "if I can quit smoking, I can start eating healthier any time I decide to - that will be a cake walk compared to this."

I realize this may sound like a question for r/weightloss but I think I'd rather hear from you guys since this issue is such an integral part of quitting smoking. Any specific tips?

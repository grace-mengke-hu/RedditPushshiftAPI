I've quit, but I haven't stopped.

I'm not writing this for the karma, the attention, or the sympathy.  This is, more-or-less, me confronting myself and admitting that I may have kicked the habit, but not the smokes.

After a year-and-a-half of trying, early in 2014 I stopped buying smokes and was able to think about it less and less.  After I realized I was trying to break an *addiction to a habit* more than trying to just break an *addiction to a thing*, the quitting process got easier.  Stopped smoking in the car, stopped smoking after eating; one by one my designated smoking times were smushed.  To the point when I was finally able to call myself a quitter with pride.  

***BUT***....

Since I was officially calling myself a "quitter", I thought that every once in a while bumming off of a friend wasn't a big deal.  For the past year, I'd sneak one from a friend on a smoke break, go out to the porch at a friends house, outside the bar, etc.  I never picked the habit back up and I never folded and started up again.  But going a few weeks without a smoke started to turn into a few days.
I never reset my badge because I always thought "I'm not a smoker again, I just like to indulge every once in a while."

But I never unsubbed from here. Probably because unconsciously I knew that I hadn't actually quit yet.  Well, guys and gals, I'm here.  

I'm done playing word games with my friends: "Well, I *did* quit."  // "I've cut *waay* back" // "Oh I just have one every *once in a while*." // "I don't smoke *nearly* as much as I used to."

I see all of you on here, some struggling, some successful, and some who are lost.  But we are all here because we believe in each other.  And I believe in you too.  But all the support in the world won't do you a bit of good, unless YOU believe in yourself.  And I believe in me.


I'll end with a quote that has actually stuck with me despite the hilarity behind it's origin:

"If you're tired of starting over, then stop giving up."

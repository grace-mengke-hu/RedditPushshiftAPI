I failed my second attempt

Today i gave in to the craving sensation that occupied my mind. But i remembered something i once read: "you never lose entire wars, only battles". Therefore, i know that i will never give up. I'm going to keep trying until i finally succeed.
Thanks to r/stopsmoking, i've seen many people helping each other to achieve a better lifestyle; and this gives me hope.
Thank you all.

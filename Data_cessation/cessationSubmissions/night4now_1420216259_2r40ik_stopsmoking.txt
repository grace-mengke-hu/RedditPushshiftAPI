Which smoke do you miss the most?

For me it's the first one of the morning. When I would wake up, I would light up, and lay there in a sleepy haze and get my first niccy fit of the day buzz on. 

This, also, is the hardest one for me to fight. I roll over, and try to go back to sleep. Or burst up and start a caffeine and sugar filled day. But it's killing me. I swear it is. 

I guess my second hardest is the 'after dinner mint', so I keep skipping whole meals, snacking and munching, but never eating and being satiated to the point of having a reward smoke.

Which is your hardest to skip? And how do you cope?

Day 56 and struggling still. I miss my friend

My life feels like it is literally falling apart around me (bunch of personal crap going on, not because I quit smoking). I bought a pack today because I have been having such intense cravings. I haven't smoked any yet. I don't really want the cigarette. I just want the comforting feeling it used to give me. It was the one thing I could depend on to be there. That's sad to say that cuz I know that I don't have any real people in my life for support so I was dependent on a cigarette for that stability. I am hurting more now than a cigarette can fix and I know that but I feel like it might be a good bandaid. But I've made it so long I don't want to go back again. I don't know what to do. Maybe someone else out there knows what I mean and what I'm going through. I dunno.

Sense of smell!

Well according to my app, I am 58 hours and 46 minutes into a smoke-free lifestyle and everything's going great! 

One thing that has really stood out so far - besides the easier breathing, better scent, and more energy - has been the return of my sense of smell. I had hardly noticed it was all-but gone! I first noticed it in class where a friend of mine had perfume on and I asked her if it was new - it wasn't. 

Then I came home from school and my roommate was cooking the same food he always does, but this time it had such a heavenly aroma to it. I was genuinely taken aback by it and just stood there for a few extra seconds, struck by the dramatic difference in my sense of smell post-cigarettes.

It's dumb, but regaining my sense of smell to this degree has given me a ton of motivation to continue and even though I may not be out of the waters yet, I'm confident in my way forward.

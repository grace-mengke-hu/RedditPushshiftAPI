March 19th, the night before I quit.

I’m writing this, because I’ve been lurking posts of this community and the support given by its members seems what I’m missing in my situation. Which is that I’m the only smoker within my circle of family and friends.
They don’t have the slightest clue how such a addiction affects you mentally let alone how it feels to quit.

I’m right now in my bed going to sleep and when I wake up and the urge for the morning cigarette occurs I sincerely hope many of you will support me with comments not to do it.

I hope this journey will make me quit and forever lose my addiction.

I've now been smoke-free for 24 hours.

Of all the times I've told myself I was going to quit once this pack/carton/etc. was gone, this is the longest I've made it. I know it isn't much but I'm pretty proud of myself.

I'm also very jittery and and easily annoyed, but hopefully that'll go away soon.

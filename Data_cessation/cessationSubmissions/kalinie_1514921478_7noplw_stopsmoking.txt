Finally taking the big plunge!

I'm quitting for new years, I'm only smoking marijuana, no tobacco AT ALL, so only bowls and hemp wraps, I feel wonderful, and I've armed myself with a portable doodle notebook and an app to track my savings and such, it's never worked with weening or vapes before. So it's cold turkey since midnight on new years, and I haven't had any strong cravings yet!

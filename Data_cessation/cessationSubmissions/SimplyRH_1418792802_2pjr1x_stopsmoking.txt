This sub should really have a dedicated IRC channel for general discussion and craving control.

Hey all. Came here to help fight an intense craving before bed. I feel like I have an anvil on my chest. I quit yesterday by throwing a pack of cigarettes in the trash and haven't relapsed yet so that's good. 

I think it would greatly benefit quitters and this sub as a whole if there was an IRC channel to help those struggling with cravings and the addiction in general. 

Anyway. That's all. If anyone out there is reading this and has any encouragement to pass along I'd love to hear it. Cheers.

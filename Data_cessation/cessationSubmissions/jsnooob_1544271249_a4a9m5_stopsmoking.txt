8 months in but I still struggle at times

There are times when I still wish I could smoke. It feels like life is incomplete without cigarettes. It's the thing that's missing from the happy events -- earlier my goto move when happy was to smoke, this is I think why I feel this way.

By now I assumed the smell of it would be repulsive but it is exactly the opposite.

Anyone else feel the same way? How do you deal with it?

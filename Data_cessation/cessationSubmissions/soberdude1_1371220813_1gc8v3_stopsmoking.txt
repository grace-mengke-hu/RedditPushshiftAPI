Day 204

After 100's of failed attempts to quit, this time was easy. No craving, no withdrawal, no gum, no patch, no e-cigarettes, no anxiety. I was just done smoking, I became a non-smoker. I wasn't trying to quit, I wasn't quitting, I QUIT!! Thanks in part to Mr. Allan Carr and his awesome book "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" I went from 1.5 packs a day for 40 years to non-smoker like I turned off a switch. Almost 7 months and IT WAS EASY! It can be easy for anyone. Read the book, quit on the truth!

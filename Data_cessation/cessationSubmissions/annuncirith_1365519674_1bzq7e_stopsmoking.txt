Day one!

I spent the weekend testing the waters on going cold turkey. Made it two days and split a pack with a friend. Now I'm 24 hours into going tobacco-free and doing great so far.

I've posted this link in another thread here, but I still want to share it - it's a quit smoking resource page hosted by a medical center near my home town. [Mount Nittany Health System](http://www.mountnittany.org/articles/healthsheets/1175). Of particular note is this: 
>Delay. The urge to smoke lasts only 3 to 5 minutes.  

It's helped me immensely already!

EDIT: I've submitted a request to remove my badge out of respect to those who are sticking to their plan. I started out cold turkey and after a few attempts it does not work out for me - I don't quite have a "craving" but my mind gets extremely fuzzy and I had trouble articulating my thoughts in class last week. I am forcing myself to cut back by leaving my last pack in my car and rationing them out.

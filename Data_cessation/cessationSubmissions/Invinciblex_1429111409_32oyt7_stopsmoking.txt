So I'm 25 and just really trying to stop smoking last night (since 21)

The taste of it just kind of almost made me want to gag for some reason, so I just put out the half I still had and threw them out.  I'm still not sure if it was a good idea, I mean I know in general it's probably a good idea for my health I guess.  I guess my days were kind of sparsed around cigs, they broke up the monotony of the day and was something to look forward to...or something.  

Well, I haven't smoked one today yet so I guess that's good.

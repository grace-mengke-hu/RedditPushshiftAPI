6 days and 3 hours, questions to you.

Hey, 
im smoke free since 6 days and 3 hours, at all im feeling good. 
But in the morning im feeling nausea or sick, as soon as i get up its all good. On the day im feeling very tired and i dont have my full concentration. Sometimes my lungs burn a little and sometimes i cant breath so good. (But much better as the Time i smoked) 

I have read much here about quitters flu. Are these typical symptomps ? When are the going away ? 

Im hoping im geting over it, and i want to be Strong. I dont want to Go trough this again.

Post-Nasal Drip after quitting...

Hello, wanted to check in after a post I did about 30 day mark, now at roughly 61\-62 days smoke free. I joined this forum to help quit the habit before it became more long\-term with higher dosage and dependency on cigarettes. For background I started smoking last year in June/July when I went to Japan then continued with about 3\-5 cigarettes on average per day, some days none, others more when I was out partying. Took me 2 months on/off to quit and finally did on March 17th. So smoked for about 7\-8 months.

Going into Winter \(Australia\), doesn't really help with colds, flu and coughing but I started coughing around the time a quit with nasal congestion. After 3 weeks, the cough went away but the nose still stayed and after a week I was coughing again, to which i went to the Doctor and they said that you'll just have to keep on not smoking and get through the nasal drip. 

Wondering whether anywhere here has experienced post\-nasal drip after quitting? I have seen that also Nasal\-drip is accompanied with sore throat, constant clearing and a cough to which the sore throat has gone away.

Going to see the doctor soon anyway to see if I can get rid of this cough as it has seemed to persist longer than it should. Also if anyone has excessive mucus or Post\-Nasal drip, I asked my pharmacy about it and they gave me some antihistamine nasal spray which has reduced \(but not cleared up\) the symptoms quite a bit.

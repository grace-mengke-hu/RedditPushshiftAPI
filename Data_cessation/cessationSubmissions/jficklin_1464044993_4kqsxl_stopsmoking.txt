Cold turkey headaches

6 days in cold turkey. I've tried quitting a number of times before, but I've always used nicotine lozenges to get through it. However, I always end up smoking within a few weeks/months when using NRTs. I just want to drop the nicotine altogether.

I feel much more dedicated and hopeful this time. Working out daily and eating healthy. However, I'm having pretty bad headaches. They kind of come and go. Is this normal even 6 days in? When can I expect some relief?

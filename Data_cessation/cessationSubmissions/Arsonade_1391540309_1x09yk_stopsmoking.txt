Looking for some advice; about 80 days in and still having trouble.

I quit about 12 weeks ago or so by using nicotine patches, I did cheat once about 2 weeks ago but other than that I haven't had a smoke once - I should probably also mention that I smoked a pipe primarily, not cigs.

Anyway, this is still really getting to me - I expected intermittent cravings by now but instead I'm experiencing near constant agitation and distraction. I can't go out driving without constantly thinking about where I could go to buy tobacco, its hard to concentrate on work, reading, even video games. I can't talk to anyone around me about it because doing so makes me think of smoking, and my bad mood has definitely been taking a toll on everybody, myself included.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think I'm running out of strategies, and I could use some advice developing some new ones. Is this sort of extended agitation common? How long can I expect this to last?

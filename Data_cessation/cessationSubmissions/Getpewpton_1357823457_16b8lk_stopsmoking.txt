Is smoking Hookah considered cheating?

I was a 6 year smoker.  Currently 57 days quit.  And was wondering if smoking some Hookah was cheating.  It is tobacco, but I dont get a nicotine high or anything at all.  I use to smoke hookah all the time, just just quit one day.  And the other day my flatmate bought a hookah, so we packed a bowl and smoked on it.  I dont feel any need/want to go back to smoking cigarettes, althought I do love smoking hookah, I still dont feel a need to smoke it.  Just something fun for me to do.  Anyway, give me you're input on the matter.  :)

Why I Quit Smoking?!

I smoked since High-school. By the time I was 30 there was more than 10 years of smoking in my life. Apparently I enjoyed smoking, it was a good reason to take a break while studying, or working, it was a good opportunity for socializing with other people who were smokers as well, and let’s face it, a cigarette after a meal or with a coffee was a pure joy. In the first years I did not bother to think about smoking and what can it mean for my health and quality of life, I smoked with the impression that it was cool as well. I’ve never even thought that you can affect others with your habit, in the end smoking was fun. By the time I was 30, approx. 20 cigarettes were my daily dose and the questions started to pop up in my mind: – what is going to happen if I’ll carry on with this, in 5, 10, 15, 20….. years? – will I enjoy a dynamic way of life on the long run? – how the people around me (family, friends, colleagues) are going to be affected by my „pleasure”? – will I be healthy as I am so far? After this questions going around in my head, I started to pay attention and slowly look at the information regarding the effects of smoking, to name only a few of them:

- reduced lung capacity

- more than 50 (yes that is right fifty !) substances that are potentially dangerous for the health

- damaged skin

- increased cancer risk

- and many more

Thinking about all this made me ask another question: Will I be able to live with myself 20 years from now, when I did some irreversible bad things to my health and life, these were the very bad news, some effects of smoking are irreversible. There will be little to do about it, and the damage is done. After months and months with this question in my head, the answer was clear and scary: It would be very difficult to bear that, and to forgive myself! So there was time to take action and do something about it and I came to the con that smoking is a stupid thing to do, THE TIME TO QUIT WAS THERE.

I had some unsuccessful attempts before, I quieted for a couple of days at the time and the falling back in, but then I managed to quit for 5 months and then for a year, but eventually after fooling myself with the myth “I will smoke just one cigarette it can’t to any harm”, I was back in the swamp again. After all these unsuccessful attempts I felt terrible, but I was very determined not to give up. And I tried again and again to get rid of this little devil that was chasing me for so long. For almost half a year I was quitting every day, throwing all the cigarettes in the toilet the day before (if I thrown them in the garbage can I would…. I am ashamed to say this….but I would go and pick them from the garbage to have another “the last one”, full time smokers understand what I am talking about). Every time there was a excuses like “only this time and then it is done”, “I know I can do it I can done it before” but this only made me continue my unhappy marriage with the little devil. As much as I was fouling myself that I was enjoying that cigarette, I felt guilty afterwords for every “last one” smoked. There were very hard times psychologically and emotionally.

One day I think it was Thursday, September 2010, after all these days of losing the battle with my little enemy, I decided for another time to quit, as I did every day for the last half a year and some times before. This time, even I felt discourage from the bad attempts before, I took one step at the time, one moment at the time, one hour at the time, one day at the time, one week at the time and so on….and since than I haven’t smoke a single cigarette.

Do you ask me if I won the war with the little devil, my answer is “I do not now”, but I still take one day at the time and have the desire not to give up. From this experience I have learned a couple of things:

- If you wanna continue smoking you have t to take responsibility for your own actions and decide not to regret it when it is going to be too late. I was not sure that I would not regret it, actually I was pretty sure that I will deeply regret it.

- In case you are not in the category above, the time to take the action is NOW, because tomorrow becomes never. Hustle, take one little step at the time and get rid of the little devil.

- You need to realize that smoking does not bring you any satisfaction whatsoever, you have to be honest with yourself to come to this conclusion. What satisfaction can bring you a bed smelling breath, poor health and a lot of lost money.

- Once you realize that you quit NOTHING you just get rid of something unnecessary, you are half way to smoking free life!

Tell your story! Why you quit smoking?! Why you intend to quit smoking?!

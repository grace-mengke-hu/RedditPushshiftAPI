Smoking still effects my life even now

I live in the Austin area and we have quite a few music festivals though out the year. My family and I went out to Batfest last weekend ( 3 stages @ the congress street bridge ). At dusk, most of the crowd gathered to watch the bats emerge from the congress st bridge and hunt insects. 

My issue wasn't with cravings, but with the other smokers in the crowd. I was really nauseated but the smell of tobacco smoke to the point that I just had to get out of the crowd watching the bats.

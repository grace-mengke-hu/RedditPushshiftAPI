This week is going to test me, but I think I can make it.

So far I have done incredibly well in avoiding temptation, but that hasn't been too hard, since I hardly hang out with anyone who smokes at the moment. The biggest reminders have been coming in through media like television and movies.

Tomorrow however, I'm leaving to go to a camping festival for the weekend and I'm going to be absolutely surrounded by smokers for about 5 days. I really don't think I'd break at this point, but it will certainly be the most difficult situation I've faced since quitting. Wish me luck everyone :)

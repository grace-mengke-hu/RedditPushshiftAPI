Planning to quit before my birthday.

I turn 23 in March. I promised a friend that I'd quit before my birthday last year. I'm not really in touch with that person anymore but I've tried before and I'm ultimately doing it for myself. 

For those of you that had a planned date, what did you do to not wimp out in the end? How did you stick with it?

For reference, I've been smoking since I was 14 and I tried quitting once last year but caved in at 19 hours. I also had some strange side effects I've never seen listed like not being able to walk straight, feeling completely off balance. I'm not sure if it was related but either way I'd love the feedback. I need to kick this habit one way or another!

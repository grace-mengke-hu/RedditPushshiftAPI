Damn, dude! 40 days?? BALLLIIN!

Pretty cool! 

Some advice: if you had been smoking for a long while before quitting, consider yourself a recovering addict. Just like a recovering addict, you can't have "just one" of the drufg. It just doesn't work like that. And don't compensate with another drug. That is a whole mess of problems you don't want to start.

Oh, and don't do the "in x amount of days ill have x amount of smokes"
Doesn't work.
Just cut it off, straight up

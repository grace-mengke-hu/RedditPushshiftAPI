So Far So Good, but...

Made it almost 2 months now and so far I'm doing good. No problems aside from replacing smoking with actively making myself fatter via more junk food.

Kinda getting worried though because my mom and I are planning on taking a trip to see the family soon. I come from a really religious family and I haven't seen them in exactly a decade. Over the years it's just become more and more unpleasant and uncomfortable to talk to them because of the rift caused by their religious conservatism and my being the exact opposite of that. 

To top that off, although I love my mother to death and she is definitely the person I am closest to in my family, the thought of spending 5 straight days with her is causing me anxiety. 

Anyway, *what's the point of this rant*? All of these things (and other anxiety-provoking issues I won't get in to) are triggering thoughts of smoking. 
I know for a fact that the airport I will be flying in to has a smoking lounge - and because my mother and I will be flying in from different states, I know that I will have to wait a good hour or two for her plane to get in so that we can pick up a rental and drive to our hotel together. 
The anxiety of the whole trip coupled with the boredom - even though the trip is a month or two off - is already making me want to smoke! I can hear the junkie rationalizing it in my head. 

Anyone dealt with this sort of situation before? How did you get through it? I'm kind of freaking out that the thoughts/feelings will get stronger the closer this trip gets. 

**TL;DR**: Planning trip to visit religious/conservative family triggering cravings/thoughts of smoking. Help?!

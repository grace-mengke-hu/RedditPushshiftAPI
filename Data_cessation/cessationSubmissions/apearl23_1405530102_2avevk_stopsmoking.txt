Really ready to quit, but I work from home and I'm worried

I'll keep it short-
I've smoked a pack a day for 10 years and am ready to quit. It's really easy to smoke because I'm a graphic/web designer who works from home. The only thing I worry about is my mental state, and if I'll be able to work. I also have anti-anxiety meds that I think will help me through the first few days. Anyone here quit while working from home, or used anxiety meds?

The reason I ask is that I've quit before, and the physical cravings were hardly there- but I broke down crying every single day because I missed my routine and just felt like I lost a big part of my life. Which is completely irrational, and I realize that when I quit before, I didn't have a plan or realize it would affect me in such a psychological way. Any advice would be so appreciated.

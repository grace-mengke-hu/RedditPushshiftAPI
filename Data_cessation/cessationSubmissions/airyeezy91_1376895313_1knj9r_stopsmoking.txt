Day 3...the sly fox that she is.

So here I am...day 3. Honestly, it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Yes the cravings are there but, with the help of Allen Carr, it's not too difficult to put them to one side. 

Don't get me wrong though...I would LOVE a cigarette. But it's the fact that I know I wouldn't ACTUALLY love it that's stopping me from lighting up.

By far the most difficult part in me stopping was getting over the fear. I know this is dealt with extensively in the book but it still took a while for me to take the plunge. In fact, once I extinguished my last cigarette, all I thought about for the full first day was smoking. Not craving, just thinking. Thinking about what I'd given up....what I wouldn't get to enjoy again.

And then I thought "Hey, you don't enjoy them and you're not giving ANYTHING up!" This just made me even more set in my decision to stop because I knew all of these stupid thoughts are just the little monster trying to make me spark up!

Anyway, the reason I started this post was to distract me from a craving but it's gone now so I'll bring this to a close!

tl;dr: Stopping isn't as bad as I thought but I'd still love a smoke.

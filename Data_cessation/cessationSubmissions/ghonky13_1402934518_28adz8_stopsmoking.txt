Soon to be Father, Day 1 is today.

I just spent the last weekend and pretty much every weekend working hard around the house in preparation for the baby.  Putting in floors, painting rooms, and staying up till 2-3 in the morning, all because I want everything to be as perfect as I can before my son comes into the world.  

Funny thing is I kept smoking.  I remember growing up around both of my parents smoking.  I always thought it didn't have an effect of me.  "I turned out fine" is what I'd say to my wife when she would ask if I would be willing to quit.  Last night it hit me.  I'm a smoker, and that's the effect my parents smoking had on me.  

**Quitting starts right now and it's the best thing I can do to prepare for my son's arrival in the next two weeks.** 

So this is for my wife, my unborn son, and myself.  I quit today, in the hopes of being here tomorrow.

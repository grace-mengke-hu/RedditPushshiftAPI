33 years

That's how long I've been smoking. I started as a kid and somehow it turned into this. I have cut down my smoking in the past, trying to wean myself off them, but it never worked. Finally something gave and I'm going cold. The last few days I went from a pack a day to 12 then 8, 6, 4 yesterday and my last one this morning. I really want one now but am trying to work with lollipops. :)

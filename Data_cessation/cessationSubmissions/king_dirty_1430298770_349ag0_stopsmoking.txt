Vaporizing - need advice where to get hardware and juice?

I am trying so hard to find the right system that will work.  I stopped at a corner store today and he was trying to sell me pot stuff and was really condescending about my questions.   Do you have a website or a product you recommend? 
Through my basic research and talking with strangers these are the things that helped them quit and stay smoke free while using a vaporizer. 

I want a huge "lung fill" as they call it.  

A device you can change the amps or voltage.  

Also, what brand of juice do you use and recommend? 

A website would be ideal, especially if the prices are better than what I saw today.  

Is there a subreddit for this question?

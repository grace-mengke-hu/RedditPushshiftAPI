Advice for quitting please!

I quit quite awhile ago after listening to the Allen Carr audio book. I started smoking again after close to a year. It’s been about six months of smoking and I can’t seem to quit again. I’ve re listened to Allen Carr probably 4 times. I logically know why I don’t want to smoke. I know I’m capable of quitting because i did it before, fairly easily even. I know I was happier as a non smoker. I know I’m annoyed with myself every day I go on smoking. 

But... despite all that, I only make it 2-4 days before I buy another pack. So I’d like to hear what worked for you guys! Thanks.

Wanted to share a victory!! Cigarette free music festival!

This weekend I went to Boston Calling Music Festival and went the whole weekend without a cancer stick! I was pretty worried because I used to smoke whenever I went to concerts and music festivals and this was my first big event since quitting. Throughout the shows I felt the urge a few times and came scarily close to bumming a cigarette off someone at the Thundercat show but I made it through!! I had a couple beers and a joint or two to stave off the urge for a cigarette and had one of the best weekends of my life. Anywho, I am very proud of this victory and wanted to share - thank you all so much for the community!

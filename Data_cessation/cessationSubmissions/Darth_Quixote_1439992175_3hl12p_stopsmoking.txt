Dreamt about smoking again last night

Nobody told me I'd still have difficult days 50+ days in. In the dream, it was so great to finally be able to take a drag again. But immediately after, the guilt of resetting the number I fought so hard for put the entire thing in perspective. I would have done anything to take it back.

Then I woke up. Breathing comes so much easier than it used to, and that's what I'm choosing to be grateful for this morning. Stay strong, peeps!

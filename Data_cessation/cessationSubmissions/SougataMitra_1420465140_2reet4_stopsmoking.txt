The Quitting Guarantee??

I have been a non smoker for past 40 days. 
Initial 3 days the craving was killing, next 2 weeks manageable. After that I hardly feel to smoke. 
But what is the average official period (likely! (; ), after that we can call ourselves as non-smokers? A permanent one? With a guarantee not to relapse?

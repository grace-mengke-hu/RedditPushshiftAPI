Still having cravings

I haven't smoked in three or four months, and haven't used snus for about three weeks. I'm pretty proud of myself for being able to stay off nicotine so far, but I'm still having cravings almost daily to either light up, or pop in a pouch of snus. How do you guys stay motivated to not go back? What are some things you did to replace nicotine?

Today is not only 90 days, but it is the first day I consider myself a non-smoker.

When I started my journey I mostly did it for vanity reasons. I didn't want yellow teeth or wrinkles around my mouth. But it was enough for me to do it. 

On day 89 I still didn't really consider myself a non-smoker. I thought that maybe one day I would go back, or slip up. And then my world changed. My grandmother (age 80) finally got her diagnosis. Lung cancer and kidney cancer. 15 years ago she battled with breast cancer and won. After that we knew there was a threat of the cancer coming back, but we never thought like this. 3/4ths of her right lung is cover in cancer. The lump on her kidney is larger than the kidney itself. And the doctors attribute it to her 30 years spent smoking. We don't have a way to save her. In 6-12 months she will no longer be in our lives. And THAT is why today I am officially a non-smoker. There is no option to pick up a pack, or steal a drag. The pain she is constantly medicated for, and the pain my family and I are going through emotionally is enough for me to know for sure.

So lurkers or people just having a difficult time... I was once one of you. I took it day by day. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't pleasant. But now more than ever I know I did the right thing! So cheers to those who have taken the leap, and LETS GO to the people who haven't. Throw that pack out and don't wait until tomorrow.

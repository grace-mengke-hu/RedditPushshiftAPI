I quit smoking 4 hours ago, because I am a triathlete!

Went running yesterday and today. Will replace smoking with exercise (to feel good), glasses of water (to relax), meditation (to calm down) and a few cups of coffee (to get some feel good chemicals).

In order to inspire myself, I have set my mission to become the fastest runner in a triathlon. I already have a race in mind in November. So, time is ticking, every cigarette from now on is pure self-sabotage. So, I declare myself an (tri)athlete, and triathletes don't smoke.

Other reasons are the usual; I'd like to have more energy, greater endurance, not get nasty diseases in the near or far future, not smell bad, etc. Also, no one knows that I am smoking, and I don't want people to find out that I do (did) this stupid thing. And I'd like to save money. Though I plan to spend it all on sporting gear during the coming months :D

Being an triathlete many things for how I will behave. I will also drink zero to no alcohol, I will exercise regularly (of course), sleep and eat well and get good equipment and take good care of it, and of myself. I feel excited, looking forwards to the race! I am confident that I will beat the opposition, last year I was 7th in the running group and by then I wasn't training consistently and I was smoking as well. Now I have 4 full months to train, and I will make every day count. So, goodbye cigarettes! I won't miss you!

Worried about starting

I'm visiting NYC right now with the wife. A bunch of her college friends have a big New Year's Eve party every year and we are going. Between my wife smoking at these type of events, meeting a bunch of new people, and drinking I'm worried I might blow this. I've stayed smoke free for more than a hundred days but it has been harder as of late. I don't plan on smoking on New Years Eve but I am worried. I'm hoping that talking about this here will make it more likely that I won't screw this up.

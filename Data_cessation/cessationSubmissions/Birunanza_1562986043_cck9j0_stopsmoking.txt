Tomorrow is the big day! Wish me luck with your best tips

I am going on a two day trip with my father and little brother.  I have been smoking consistently for over ten years and I finally WANT to stop.  My little brother is still a teenager who looks up to me and my father abhors smoking, so I thought this would be a good time to quit, since sneaking away for cigarettes will be nearly impossible anyways.  I have been following the sub for awhile, I read Allan Carr's book a couple years ago, it didn't really do anything for me.  I have some nicotine pills and gum but I kind of hate them and will probably save for emergencies;  I'll set my badge up tomorrow and would love to hear any advice or supportive words you have to share.  Thanks!

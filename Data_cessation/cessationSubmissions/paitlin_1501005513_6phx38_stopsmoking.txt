Today is the day :)

Hi r/stopsmoking!
I'm 21 years old, starting casually smoking at about age 15, and I've consistently smoked a pack a day for about five years. I have three cigarettes left, I'm about half way through Allen Carr's Easyway, and I'm feeling good about this. I've done some half-assed quits in the past, tried to cut back, invested in a mod for vaping, all of which failed, but I'm ready to nip this shit in the butt (pun intended), so I'm just going to stop.  
So to the veteran quitters: I'd love to hear some of your favorite tips/insights/stories to help me get over the three day hump.

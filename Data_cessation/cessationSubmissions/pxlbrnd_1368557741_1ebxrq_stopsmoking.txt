About to quit smoking after 8 yrs

So, 8yrs * 365days/yr * 13 cigs/day = 37960 cigs. That, given the prices of cigs in my country, estimates to some $10300.

I really should quit. And not just because I got to know a girl, who doesn't like it.
I've tried quitting several times, and everytime I've had a sadding fallback, my personal best being 9 days smoke-free. These were some stressful days and I struggled pretty hard.

But maybe this time i will succeed. I really want to.

I read that not the often mentioned "first 3 days are the hardest", it's actually the first 3 weeks, until the human body begins to habituate to missing the nicotine.

Just a quick question, and maybe I get some inspiration out of your answers:
What did you do to distract yourself from your addiction in the first couple of days?

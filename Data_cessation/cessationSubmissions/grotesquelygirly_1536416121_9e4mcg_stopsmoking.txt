3 Months Smoke Free! And I ALMOST ruined it...

I went to a wedding last night and was drinking for the first time since I’ve quit. Which is obviously a big trigger for me. I went outside with some old smoker friends and I asked for a drag. I had the cigarette in my hand, and I couldn’t do it. Just holding it felt weird. So I immediately handed it right back!

 I am so incredibly proud of myself and it really speaks to all the work I've done on myself in therapy. No more self sabatoging for this girl!

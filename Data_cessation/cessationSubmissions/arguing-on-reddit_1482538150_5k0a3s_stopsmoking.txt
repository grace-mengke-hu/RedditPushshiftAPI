I really have to do it this time

I smoked for a few years in high school, and quit shortly after I graduated (IIRC, I finished the pack I had from NYE 2008, so I quit New Year's Day 09). It was a super easy quit, pretty much cold turkey. Then in 2012 I moved away for college, amd started again, and quitting this time hasn't been as easy.

But it's starting to take a toll on me. I get bronchitis about twice a year, when the weather changes in the spring and fall (I always have, I've got asthma - another reason to quit). Every time I've gotten it the last two years I've said "This is it, I have to quit," but it never works out. 

I'm not totally sure if I have bronchitis right now, but I definitely have some type of infection and a wicked cough, and this is it for real. I have to quit. I have a girlfriend I love (who unfortunately smokes more than I do, but when I quit before I was dating a smoker and it wasn't bad), and I want to do everything I can to have as much time with her as possible. Two days ago, I think, was my last cigarette. I'm gonna go over to vaping, at least for a bit, just to have something for the oral fixation...I'm not too concerned about the health risks of it right now, it sure as shit can't be worse than fucking cigarettes.

Anyway, wish me luck.

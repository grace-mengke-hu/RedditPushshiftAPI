7 weeks without a single cigarette, today I fucked up.

I quit 7 weeks and 4 days ago, haven't touched a single cigarette and thought I'd be free this time. 

Today without any reason I felt a bit down and just decided to buy a pack and smoked about 5 now. Why the fuck did I do this? Honestly I feel so fucking dumb. There's nothing positive about a cigarette, it smells, it doesn't taste good and it's expensive...

:(

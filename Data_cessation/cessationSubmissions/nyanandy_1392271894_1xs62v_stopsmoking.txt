I picked the worst time to quit.

So im in the Army, and currently deployed to afghanistan. I quit about a week ago, and while not smoking isnt too hard for me, it was the only thing keeping me sane over here. i used to smoke about a pack a day, and im on the patch now. I feel like if i was back home i could quit no problem, but being here, working every day, and being with people i cant stand...i feel like i should just start up again and quit when i get home. My logic being "if it makes deployment easier, i'll do it" 

Anyone else try to quit on deployment, or have similar experiences?

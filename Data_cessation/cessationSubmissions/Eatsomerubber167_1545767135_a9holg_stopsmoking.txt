Is dreaming about smoking normal?

Hi, I haven't smoked in about 4 weeks and at least every 3-4 days I get a very vivid dream that I buy a pack and smoke a couple, after which I feel horrible and ashamed. I consider them nightmar*ish*, but not total nightmares, was wondering if this is common for people once they quit?

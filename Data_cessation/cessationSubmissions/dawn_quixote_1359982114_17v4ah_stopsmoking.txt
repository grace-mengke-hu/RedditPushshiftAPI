A victory and a rant.

I smoked my last cigarette Friday morning on a trip to my grandma's house.  I knew nobody there smoked so it would be the perfect environment to spend the first couple days.

My dad used to smoke 3 packs a day, but he quit in June because he had a heart attack.  I was so proud of him and I was looking forward to his words of affirmation as I followed in his footsteps towards better health.

The whole family is soooo proud of his decision to quit smoking and thus far, nobody has doubted his commitment.  He jokes around all the time saying "I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette!" as he goes for multiple walks around the neighborhood.  The thing is, he actually IS smoking!  It's only e-cigs, but even that little bit of temptation being thrown in my face every half an hour made me want to scream!  He KNEW I was quitting cold turkey this weekend and yet every time we were alone together, he pulled out that stupid e-cig and started puffing away.

What kills me the most is how much he brags about quitting in front of his family even now, 7 or so months after his official quit date.  I'm proud of him for switching over to e-cigs because I'm sure it's healthier than the real thing, but he didn't have to throw it in my face the whole time I was up there!

Anyways, I managed to make it through the weekend with only 1 minor panic attack 2.5 hours after my last puff.

Saturday morning, I was tingly everywhere as oxygen was finally able to reach my extremities after 16 years of carbon-monoxide poisoning.

I don't feel my heart beating anymore when I lie down.    There used to be a very prominent chest thumping, but it's gone now.

I have the breath of a zombie and everything tastes rotten.  

I'm light headed almost all the time and I can breath.

I'll check in again next week.  :)

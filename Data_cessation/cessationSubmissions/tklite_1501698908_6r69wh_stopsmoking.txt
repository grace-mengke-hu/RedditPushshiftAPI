A big thank you to r/smoking and some advice to people looking to quit

I was going through my post history the other day, and realized that the first post I ever submitted to Reddit was right here in r/stopsmoking nerly 8 years ago.

[What kind of smoker am I and how can I stop?](https://redd.it/a7yrq)

A lot of things were happening with my life then, and I knew something needed to change. I want to point out that there was nearly a year (10 months precisely) between when I made that post and when I quit. As I stated in that post, I had quit multiple times before, sometimes for many months, but I just kept coming back. I honestly felt trapped. All those times I quit, I felt like a smoker who just wasn't smoking at the time, and any little thing could send me to the corner market to pick up a pack of cigs. Quitting doesn't happen immediately or overnight. Quitting is a process that sometimes takes awhile to finally sink in.

Many more things would change between that post and when I finally quit, but the thing that changed the most was the realization that, all things being equal, someone else wasn't going to make me quit smoking, I had to do it. As long as you realize that you want to quit, no matter the reason, you're headed in the right direction.

Earlier this week, I was reminded by a fellow quitter here that I had reached 2500 days quit. Thank you all for being here. Congratulations to those of you who have succeeded. Good luck to those of you on your journey. We hope those of you who have yet to begin can join us soon.

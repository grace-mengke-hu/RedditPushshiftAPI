Just a question

Everyone is talking about this book "how to stop smoking the easy way". I'm about a month and 2 weeks quit with 3 slip ups while drunk. Anyway my point is from what I've seen people say about the book I get the impression that you want to read it while you are still a smoker for some reason.  Is this true? Will It be as affective for me now as opposed to when I was smoking? I'd love I see what all the hype is about. I could definitely use some more motivation so stay off the smokes.. I still crave them much more then I'd like to. Thanks.

Should I try Chantix if I have OCD?

I was diagnosed with OCD 2 years ago. I am a 22 year old male. My OCD revolves around sexual obsessions/imagery. I'm so tired of smoking, I want to get into shape and live an anxiety free life, but I can't quit smoking as I just get so irritated and miserable without smoking. I started seeing a new doctor and I didn't tell him a psychologist diagnosed me with OCD. I heard people that have a mental disorder shouldn't use Chantix but I feel as if it's my last option. I've read Allen Carrs book and although it made sense, it didn't take away that physical urge to smoke. I'm scared by taking Chantix I might fall into a deep depression or my anxiety might worsen. My OCD is bad some days and other days it's not. I just want to quit smoking but have heard both good and bad things about Chantix

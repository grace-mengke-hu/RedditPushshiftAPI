Fuck this, I'm done.

I'm done not being able to breathe. I'm done wasting all my money on an earlier death sentence. I'm done not being able to walk quickly without being out of breath. I'm doing being sick, but STILL smoking cause I'm an addict. 

I probably haven't been smoking as long as most people. I didn't start until I was 18 and I'll be 21 in March. Due to some personal issues I went through that I was too weak to deal with, I went from smoking a pack every few days to a pack or more a day. I tried and almost successfully quit at the start of this year. I didn't smoke for a month straight after using the patch for 2-3 weeks and I felt AMAZING.

But, I kept letting myself have a smoke here and there after that first month. "Oh, I survived a month without cigarettes? I deserve ONE smoke.". But then one becomes two and two becomes another pack and now I'm addicted all over again.

Today is the last fucking day. I will no longer be a slave to this. Good riddance tobacco, you filthy piece of shit.

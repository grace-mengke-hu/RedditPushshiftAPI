Health problems 5 weeks after quitting

Hi everyone!  I quit smoking a little more than 5 weeks ago.  I'm 23 and smoked 1 pack a day for 6 years.  

I am no longer craving cigarettes - I feel pretty good on that front, but I'm having a few frustrating health issues, and I want to know if any of you have experienced the same (in fact, I'm sure most of you have, but it just makes me feel better to talk to others about it).

I have a seemingly constant stream of mucus coming out of my nose and chest.  It is awful, and hasn't gotten better!  My stomach is extremely sensitive, and I never know how food is going to effect me.  My LEAST favorite part is that I am having heart palpitations, a tight chest, and random spurts of shortness of breath.

How long did these symptoms last for all of you, if at all?  Thanks!

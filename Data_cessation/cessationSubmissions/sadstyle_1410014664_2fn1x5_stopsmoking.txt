One Month

31 days of no smoking. I am trying to wrap my head around the fact I had not a single puff in a month. It hasn't completely sunk in yet.

Checking this subreddit and the number on the badge were very motivating. I don't want to break the streak and frankly a month is too good to be true, I don't want to start from 1 again. Here's to another 31 days!

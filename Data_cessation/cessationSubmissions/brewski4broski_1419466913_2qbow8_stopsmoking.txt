"A Year from now you'll be happy you quit"

I didn't quit. I stopped. Like many of you I used the "Easy Way To Stop Smoking" book from Allen Carr. For the last 4-5 years I tried "quitting" every month. Finally I read his book last January, and stopped completely. 

People who successfully stopped, or didn't smoke used to tell me "imagine yourself a year from now how much happier you will be"

Well it's almost a year - I didn't keep track of the exact date, but it was near the beginning of January, so it's approaching a year. It's by far the best decision i've ever made. When I look back at how stupid I was as a smoker I can't help but shake my head. 

I'm no longer addicted to the worst drug in the world. It was disgusting, and my health & life have improved tenfold since I stopped.

I urge you all that are in your first day, week, month or whatever to keep it up. You don't want to start back over again. You WILL feel amazing a year from now.

Hope you're in the same spot I am this time in 2015.

best of luck to you all, I know you can do it.

429 days. Thank you!

I barely ever post here, but I quite often read the sub. I had completely forgotten about my one year, and smoking is definitely a thing of my past

To all of those with less days, keep pushing, to all of those with more days, I hope you stay ahead and for all of those still at zero...keep trying!

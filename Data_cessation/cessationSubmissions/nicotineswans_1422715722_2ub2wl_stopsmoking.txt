Chantix made me dumb

I'm a 27 year old male who used Chantix to stop smoking about a year and a half ago. While it did not help me quit, it didn't really cause any of the crazy side effects you often hear about either. However since taking the drug I have felt, I don't know... fogged over, mentally. Where I've always been a pretty sharp person in conversation and a good story teller, it's like I can't even construct a decent sentence these days. I am a writer and have experienced no problems in that area; this is mostly in conversation. I have a hard time focusing on what people are saying to me, and my responses are usually a series of broken thoughts or me trying to piece together what I mean. This began very suddenly while on Chantix and has not gone away. Has anyone else experienced this or something similar? I know it's weird.

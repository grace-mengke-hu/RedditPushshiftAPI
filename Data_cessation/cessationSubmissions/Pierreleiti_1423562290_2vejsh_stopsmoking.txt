I QUIT TODAY!

It is enough now!

I have been smoking since I was 15 years old, and now I am almost 19! I am sick and tired of smelling like shit. I want to smell nice from a nice parfume or shampoo. 

All my money is gone! I live for myself in a little apartment and have no money, s√• why do I smoke? 

I almost can't run a mile because my lungs is turning into dust.

Enough is enough! I want to be able to run, to dance, smell nice and buy myself some nice things for some money I didn't use this month! 

I AM QUITTING NOW!

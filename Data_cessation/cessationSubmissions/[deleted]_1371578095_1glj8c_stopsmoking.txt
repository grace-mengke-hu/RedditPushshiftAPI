Quit on Saturday. Going 3 days smoke free.

I hate that it took getting to this point, but I got incredibly sick a couple weeks ago. I attempted a couple times since receiving antibiotics to have a smoke, but it just didn't taste right. After drinking and having a few smokes at the global reddit meetup saturday I felt terrible and decided that this time, I'm done for good.

For the first time last night I noticed how strongly my friends smell when coming back inside from smoking. Now I feel embarrassed that I dragged that smell into my SO's (who is a non-smoker) house so many times. Never again. Going on almost 3 days smoke free now. Longest I've ever managed before. Hope I can keep it up!

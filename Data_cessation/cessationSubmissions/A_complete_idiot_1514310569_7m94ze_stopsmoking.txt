Here's how screwed up my head is...

I'm 4 days in and just realized this... I just saw some one with cancer and actually thought about, and missed smoking.  I realized previously that would even made me smoke.  Isn't that the most fucked up thing ever?  Just posting this to remind myself how much nicotine fucks with your head...

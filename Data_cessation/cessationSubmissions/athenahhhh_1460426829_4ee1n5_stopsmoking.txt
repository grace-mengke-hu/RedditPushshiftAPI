A little over a year ago u/DivinityGod posted here about his father passing away due to smoking. After reading his post I got a new badge and gave it another shot. Today is day 366.

I still think about his post and his father once in a while. I'm sad that cigarettes killed him. I don't want cigarettes to kill me. I don't know why it was your story that helped me to quit, but I want to thank you again u/DivinityGod for sharing your father's story.

What the fuck

I usually post some pretty upbeat stuff about how I'm doing well and fuck this addiction and cigs ain't gon get me and shit and some other swears and fucks, but today I cried for absolutely no reason like I've never been so emotional someone said something and it wasn't even rude I just cried and I'm a 6'1 220lb muscle man bear and there I was crammed into my little Nissan just crying away. What in the fuck. Tears don't go well with brown rice and chicken nahmsayin?

I just DESTROYED my filthy pack

June 21 2019, 4:05pm.
I just sent my friend a Facebook video message of me crushing my filthy pack of cigarettes and throwing in the garbage where they belong. I hate being a smoker. I smell disgusting. It’s way too expensive. I’m tired of having to hide it from my spouse. I’m tired of having to take showers to get the smell off of me so my spouse doesn’t smell it. I’m tired of having to use mouth wash and brushing my teeth after every time I cowardly go out to sneak my smokes. I’m tired of paying OVER $9.00 a pack for these filthy smelling things. What do I do it for? Because it addicted me? Those bastards at the manufacturers!!!! How dare they put those chemicals in them to make me a slave!!!! How dare they!!!!! And what’s the reward? There are no rewards. Only $50.00 a week out of my bank account. I don’t want to die of cancer or COPD!!!! I am a non smoker!!!! If I make it through the next three days I will be successful until the next big test. I AM SMOKE FREE!!!!!!

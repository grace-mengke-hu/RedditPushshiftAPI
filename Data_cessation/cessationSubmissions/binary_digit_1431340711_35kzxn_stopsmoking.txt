A word of warning to my fellow ents

I reset my nicotine timer by accident yesterday.  I smoked a blunt with a couple of friends without a second thought.  It wasn't until the little bit of a nicotine buzz hit that I realized what I had done.

TIL Blunt wraps are made from tobacco, and they contain nicotine.

If you are quitting, but you still smoke trees, stay away from blunt wraps.

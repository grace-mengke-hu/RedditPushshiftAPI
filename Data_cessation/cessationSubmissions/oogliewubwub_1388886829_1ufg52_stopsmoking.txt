End of Day 4

My hair smells exceptional.
My nails look very nice. I treated myself and painted them last night.
I had two triggers today - the first was when I went to the grocery to stock up before this snowstorm hits. I usually smoke as soon as I get home and before I put away the food.  I sucked on a sucker instead.
The second was right after dinner - I was stuffed to the gills and just wanted to sit outside on the step, look at the stars and enjoy a smoke. I gave my kid a bath instead.
Now I"m heading to bed.
Night all, hope my fellow quitters are doing as well as I am right now.

I'm doing good!

Okay so I have been doing really good! I haven't had a single cigarette since 6 am Saturday morning so it's been almost 48 hours already!! The cravings haven't been as bad today and honestly the first 24 were the hardest of all. I kinda want to smoke a cig just to do it and prove I could smoke it and then not want another but I'm not going to cause its probably just my addiction trying to trick me! It's made me feel so much better about myself to be able to make it these first couple days without fucking up, there were a couple times that it felt like the entire world was working against me to make me cave in and fall right back in to it, but here I am just shy of 48 hours and going strong! I would just like to say thank you to all of you. Without your stories and support there is no possible way I would have ever made it even this far and I'm looking forward to spending a lot more time here with all of you!

Day 12

It's interesting to watch the cravings wax and wane on the app.  Bc it feels like they are almost constant and almost always at 10.  My crave history proves that is a lie.  They are fewer and further between.  That's reassuring.  

I am using lozenges still, bc they seem to keep me saner and more sure of my quit.  I am so ready to be past this habit.  

Those of you who have quit for a good while, do you truly feel like a non smoker?  Or a smoker who isn't smoking?

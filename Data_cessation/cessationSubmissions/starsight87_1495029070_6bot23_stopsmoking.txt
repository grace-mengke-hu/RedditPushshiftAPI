Day 12 - Just being more aware

There are little things each day that used to derail me. Listening to my family vent about work, getting a deadline that was tight, or just dealing with the daily grind of a long-time relationship. I've concluded that the main thing about smoking that I wanted through all of these things was just a bit of space to disconnect before dealing with the everyday. 

I value that time and space but the smoking has made it so I don't cope with my day to day life in a healthy way. It became about managing stress through something that was bending me out of shape. I want that time but not the method I was using. 

I've been running a lot lately and over the last few weeks of trying to quit have managed to build up to 4.5k. At the end of a run in the morning I just sit there on the trail and just breath. It has become that moment that I crave and lets me feel ready for the day. 

Wish you all the best today.

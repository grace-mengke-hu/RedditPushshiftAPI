Im not quitting today

I've been quitting daily for over two years now. Or, in other words, i've been actively torturing myself, put myself down daily for two years.

I simply could not get through 1 day of not smoking, and the pressure and hate i put onto myself made that worse.

Last week i got sick. Flu. Fuck, ok, bit of a weird sore cough too. Doc says bronchitis. Next two days i very nearly died from INTENSE coughing, couldnt breathe, sooo much pain. Back to doc and i've upgraded to pneumonia and very nearly had to go into hospital. 

That morning was sunday and also the last time i smoked. It just hit me: it's time dude, you just have to quit now, its time. The next one will very likely kill you. 

So today is not my quit day. Today is day 2, and i'm okay. I start feeling better and everytime i crave i feel that pain of chest and cough again and it passes. 

My son shouldn't miss his dad because he wanted a smoke.  

My wife is having a harder time quitting but she is doing it with me all the way!

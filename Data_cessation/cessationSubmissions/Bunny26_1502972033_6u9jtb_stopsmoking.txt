Tomorrow is our last day.

My husband and I are giving up after we finish our last packs of smokes. Smoke prices are fucking ridiculous here, it costs $44 for a 40 pack, we smoke roughly 20 a day each. $1320 a month. It's beyond ridiculous, it's the epitome of stupidity. He has been smoking for 11 years, I have been smoking for 7, we are over it. I have read Allen Carr's book and we both have been mentally preparing for a month. I have been lurkin' this sub for a while on my alt account, afraid of being judged because, (and yes I know how fucking indescribably bad it is) I smoked through 2 pregnancies. Luckily I had very healthy babies and so far no bad repercussions for my addiction.

We are sick of having a constant cough and those colds that last for weeks. We are sick of forking out $500 at a time for something that makes us sick, lazy and takes away our freedom, a literal waste of money. We have had enough of smoking out of nervousness, excitement, anger, sadness, joy, hunger, fullness, boredom, achievement and just about every other excuse. I am not going to miss it. 

We have cut down a lot and with every smoke we are starting to hate them, all the time wasted, the money.

We bought some nicotine free e-cigs which have helped us all but quit so far, we are going to buy a car now, a brand new car, because the repayments are less than what we used to spend on smokes. 

The best thing about quitting? The chain reaction that it will start with our families, who wouldn't quit because it's too hard being around smokers. The extra years we will gain for our children, and our health, the freedom of not going outside 20+ times a day, the list is actually endless, there is nothing good about smoking. **Nothing.**


Edit: you guys are amazing! Thanks for the support ♡♡♡ this sub is great

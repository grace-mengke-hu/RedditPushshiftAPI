2 weeks smoke-free, and breathing is... Worse?

So I'm an 18 year old in first year of university, and I started smoking over two years ago. I have tried to quit plenty of times, but usually end up caving. I think this time will be different though because I've replaced the habit with other things like going to the gym. I've noticed though that my breathing feels worse than it was while I smoked? For example I used to be able to breathe and sleep just fine when I smoked, but now I can't sleep because it's so hard to breathe? Is that normal?

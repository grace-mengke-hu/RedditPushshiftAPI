Day 1 (100th attempt)

I’ve tried quitting almost every time I’ve got to the end of a packet for the last 2 years. This is the time I’ll stop for good. Its expensive($35 for 25) and I honestly haven’t enjoyed the things for ages, it’s just some shitty need/addiction. I’ve sucked down about a pack a day for the past 4 years. Got the smoke free app and it’s been 10 minutes. I’d like to go out to dinner and not want to smoke within 30 seconds of finishing my plate. 
It’s been 19 minutes now!

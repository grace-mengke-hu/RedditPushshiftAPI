Quitting vaping hopefully this is allowed

Hey guys hopefully you’ll accept me as I’m not sure where to go lol. I’m going on no nicotine now as my vape broke and I’ve stopped cold turkey. I chain vaped 3mg juice and it’s my second day quitting now. My question is I feel like I have a void now in my life. I’m not going back again but how long will I feel like there’s literally a hole in my chest that needs filled. Apart from headaches it’s been manageable. Thanks.

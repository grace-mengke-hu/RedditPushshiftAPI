100 Days

I can even begin to say how much better I feel, look, smell, etc. For those of you who are just starting out or trying again, some for the upteenth time: work through it, the other side is unbelievably good. 

I had horrible withdrawals the first week, the second week lightened and now, tbh, I rarely ever think about smokes. I get the passing thought every now and again, but now I am simply a non-smoker. Smoked for 10+ years and now I feel mentally like I did before I started. Keep it up. And thank you all for the inspiration.

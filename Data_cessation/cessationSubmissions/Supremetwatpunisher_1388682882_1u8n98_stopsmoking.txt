New here but my thoughts

I decided to quit smoking on the 28th of last month. I know its only been 5 days but I feel like im done for good now. I have tried to quit before while I was in the army but that was near impossible. Im 25 now and have been smoking 1-2 packs a day for the last 9 years. My personal opinion on why this time has been easier is because I have told no one about quitting. I decided to do it for myself and feel that when you tell people you're quitting you have to lie to them about you sneaking a smoke or feel bad if you do smoke, which is added pressure on a situation that is pretty stressful as is. Thanks for listening and I hope everyone here is successful at quitting sooner rather than later!

I don't need or want cigarettes. I never thought it would be possible.

I've moved into my own apartment. I've had major fights with my SO. I've been horribly depressed. I just got back to my new apartment from a new brewery that opened up in my town. But I'm not even worried about cigarettes. I saw people smoking outside and barely gave it a second thought.


To any newcomers to this sub - stick with it! This sub is so amazingly helpful. I haven't been on it for a while because I've had some major upsets in my life, but I know this sub is always here for me when I need it. Just knowing that has given me a lot of confidence when I was really struggling with this addiction. 

I just drank two pretty strong pints and I have zero craving! I love living a cigarette-free life!

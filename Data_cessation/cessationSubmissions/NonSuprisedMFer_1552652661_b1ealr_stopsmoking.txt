How long should I forego drinking?

I'm in the process of quitting smoking and as of now drinking still triggers desire to smoke pretty heavily. Is there any rule of thumb for how long I should be nicotine free before enjoying a drink again?

I was thinking 90 days would be a good place to start but I figured I'd ask the experts.

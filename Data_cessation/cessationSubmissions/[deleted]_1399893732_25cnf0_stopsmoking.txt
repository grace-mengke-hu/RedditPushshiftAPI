I'm going to quit!

I went for a run yesterday and couldn't make it without my heart racing and feeling the need to gasp for breath. I used to be a really fit as a kid. I'm only 21 now and it felt like only yesterday I was able to run a 1km track easy. 

I'm sick of the coughing. I'm sick of the constant smell lingering on my fingers and clothes. I'm sick of the need to always duck out and have a ciggie. I'm sick of my sleep disruption. I'm sick of paying $20/pack*4 a week to fund my habit. 

If it wasn't for working in kitchens I probably would never have picked up this nasty habit. I love my work and I'll just have to find something else to keep the stress away. 

I've unsubscribed to /r/cigarettes and /r/trees and I'll buy some patches tomorrow. 

I'm ready to quit. 

A few questions though. Checked the sidebar are there doesn't seem to be a wiki. 

* With regards to lungs, is the damage irreversible? 

* Are there any ex smokers who are gyming/got back into fitness? How do you find your progress after quitting? 

* Ex smokers, has your relationship with your smoker friends changed? 

I'm a little nervous for some odd reason, but at least I know it's for the better.

Did a relapse help anyone quit for good?

I quit for 10 days then smoked a cigarette which turned into buying a pack (all whilst drunk). I binge smoked for two days and then snapped out of it. Now I am going on 5 days clean and it feels way easier than last time. The difference is I have been working out a lot more and haven't been drinking as much. I know it's only been 5 days but I know this is the final quit. Anyone else have a similar experience?

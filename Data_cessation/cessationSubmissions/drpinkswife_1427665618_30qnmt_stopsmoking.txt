Two Things

I just finished my 2 week 1000 mile road trip in CA/AZ/NV. Two weeks to drive 1000 miles you say? Hells yeah, I had loads of people to visit. 

I only encountered one super smoker on my journey and he needs to quit. (Yeah I know, not my decision!) He really does want to quit.  Does anyone have the latest link to the Allen Carr bootleg? I'd send him the book but I think the video is more effective and less patronising.

OH yeah! I went into a casino that allows smoking! Do all casinos allow smoking? It was completely foul. I have a $20 limit and I should have just tossed my money in the door and ran. I'll spend more on the dry cleaning!

So was that one thing or two things? Right....thing number 2. I'm still here! 

Congratulations if you're still here and welcome if you are newly joined. It is the best decision you will make.

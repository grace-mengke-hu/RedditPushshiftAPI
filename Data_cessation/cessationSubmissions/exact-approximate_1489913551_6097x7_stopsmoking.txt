12 Weeks

12 Weeks today, after quitting pack-a-day smoking cold-turkey on Christmas Day 2016.

12 Long weeks, full of ups and downs; but I can now confidently say that I don't want to smoke; I don't crave the taste or smell of a cigarette anymore, actually it makes me want to throw up.

On the other hand, I am still having trouble dealing with my daily frustrations and challenges. This is because I used smoking as a coping mechanism. Today, I drink more coffee, breathe, eat, walk instead. This is slowly getting easier.

Looking forward to triple digits.

I can't "be strong" anymore

Every other aspect/area of my life is just so sad, depressing, anxiety provoking and hard that I'm finding it completely impossible to stay strong and not smoke. I don't have any strength or will power left over after the rest of my life. 

Has anyone gotten through this? Does anyone kinda know what I'm talking about?

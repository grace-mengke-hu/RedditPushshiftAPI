Persistent cough

Hi everyone.  I quit smoking probably 4-5 months ago.  The strange thing is i have had a persistent dry cough since quitting.  I cough more now than when i did when i was smoking.  Is this normal and if it is why is it happening?  

I know about cilia “waking up” after quitting and making people cough but from everything ive read 4-5 months is a long time for the cough to persist.  Can anyone provide insight?  Thanks.

"u don't actually WANT to quit..."

i'm on day 3! 
so far hasn't been as bad as i thought honestly. a little anxious, jittery, irritable

the hardest part has been convincing myself that my intrusive thoughts are actually cravings! i keep finding myself thinking "you don't actually want to quit rn, you're not ready, what does it matter if i have a couple today/i'll quit again tomorrow"
like my brain is trying to be coy by pretending these are my feelings and not a chemical craving

i've been trying to distract myself, but it's like an itch in the back of my head, looping around all day.

this has got me feeling like an imposter... &amp; since i don't feel that bad otherwise, it's like, well maybe this isn't that bad of a problem, i can smoke a little longer... 

how do i convince myself that this IS what i want &amp; this IS the right time &amp; it DOES matter that i quit NOW?
am i not ready to let this addiction go?

thanks &lt;3

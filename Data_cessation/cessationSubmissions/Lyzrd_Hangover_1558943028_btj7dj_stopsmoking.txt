Two days in and I'm not much fun to be around!

I feel really sorry for my husband and my son, I'm being so short and snappy. I know it's only temporary but the temptation to smoke so that I won't be such a bitch anymore, it's pretty overwhelming. Please tell me this gets easier quickly!
My son is only four and has no idea what's going on, luckily he has no idea I smoke. My husband though, I think it's starting to piss him off. He made a comment last night about me being cold and giving him no affection, but I'm not trying to be off with him.
I need to keep my eye on the prize...

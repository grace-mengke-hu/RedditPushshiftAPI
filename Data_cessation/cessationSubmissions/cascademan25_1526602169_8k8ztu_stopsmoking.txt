Two days and 17 hours in!

I want to smoke when I get stressed.  When family problem arise, I want to go out and smoke.  I feel depressed and anxious about our family situation and a smoke helps.  Honestly tho, I know that it only helps for that moment when you get that hit of nicotine.  I know the harmful effects significantly outweigh any perceived benefit.  I know this absolutely.  Also, after I smoke im actually more moody and irritable and this doesn’t help our family.  Dying prematurely from a smoking related illness won’t help our family either!

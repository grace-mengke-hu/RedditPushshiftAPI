15 days and having a rough time.

I quit 15 days ago and it hasn't been too bad so far but tomorrow I have to drive 1.5 hours (driving is typically when I smoke the most) to deal with some highly stressfull work related shit. I keep thinking it will be ok to have a couple of cigarrettes on the way, but then the thought of starting over really disappoints me. 

I smoked for over 30 yrs with a 4 month break about 10 yrs ago. I really want to succeed this time.

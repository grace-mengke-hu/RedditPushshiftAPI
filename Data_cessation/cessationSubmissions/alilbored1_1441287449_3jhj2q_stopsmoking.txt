The "special cigarette"

Day 1 for me. The craving is intense for the special cigarette: the first one with my morning coffee. Though I've been able to go without it for a half hour, it's very hard.

I'm on Bupropion and that seems to help with a majority of the cravings throughout the day, just not that special cigarette in the morning. Any tips from those who fancied the coffee/cigarette combo?

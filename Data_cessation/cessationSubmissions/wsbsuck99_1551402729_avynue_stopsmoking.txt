Quit 6 months ago and had my drink of liquor last weekend.

10 year pack a day ex-smoker and now 27. Went to a big party and had three beers and a little bit of liquor. As I was sipping the liquor i was thinking how a cig would be nice. But immediately killed the thought and started pounding back the water. Beer is fine I just used to drink liquor and chain smoke so it's still a gray zone for me. Cigs and whisky used go hand and hand for me. Anyways I think I'm gonna go another six months without liquor. I'm kind of scared of getting drunk bc I do NOT want to "loose control" and light up again.

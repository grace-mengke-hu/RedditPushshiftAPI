I had to call a support hotline

i went online in a moment of desperation and came across iquit. Com. They had a 1800 number for my state that was so helpful the woman who answered was so sympathetic... Took all my info and set me up with a coach. Offered me free products and the coach told me of these apps i could download on my smartphone from the app store if i just searched under " quit smoking" so i did and yes i found one i rely on heavily daily.... I'm trying everything to to support myself and wanted to pass this on... Now I'm set up with 5 scheduled coaches to talk with plus i can call them anytime i need them in between... It's really helpful

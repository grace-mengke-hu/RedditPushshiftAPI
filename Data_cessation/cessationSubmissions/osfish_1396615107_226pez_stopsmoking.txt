Second hand smoke...

So I have been going for 36 hours now. This morning at the coffee truck I grab an egg sandwich, water and an oj.  Some people were outside... I  figured fine let me be normal and stop and talk.  Safe to say I do not like the smell at this point. But the second hand smoke is that grounds to reset the counter...  More importantly the nicotine addiction brain counter.

Why I think it will work this time

I haven’t posted before. I had my last cigarette five days ago, but my last nicotine 2 days ago. I have been a pack a day smoker for about 15 years or so. I quit for extended periods of time all three times I was pregnant (and I’m not really sure how cause it never worked outside of those times) and then besides that I’ve quit approximately 50 billion times usually for less than 3 days occasionally up to a couple weeks. 

I started out almost 5 days ago using nicotine patches (which I have used before and failed with), the smoke free app (same), and this subreddit. On here I saw the recommendation for Allen Carr’s book and I read it. When I finished it I took off the nicotine patches as well so I am on day 2 no nicotine. I’ve had the usual sleep disturbances, stomach problems, etc. The last couple hours I’ve had some pretty intense cravings but it is different this time. I am recognizing them as physical symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and nothing more. What’s missing is all those mental gymnastics I used to do (I’ll never be able to cope with anxiety, maybe it’s better if I start next week, one cigarette won’t hurt me, it doesn’t matter I’ve already damaged my lungs anyway, etc). As I’m sure you’re aware the addicted mind can get quite creative. But this time those thoughts are not even popping up and the mental part is 90% of the battle. I could be wrong, I’ve failed a thousand times before, but I feel good about this time. Wish me luck!

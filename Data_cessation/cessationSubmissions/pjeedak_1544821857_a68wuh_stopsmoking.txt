Three days without a smoke and It actually isn't that hard, although having sleeping difficulties..

Had my last smoke on tuesday then threw half a pack away. I kind of felt my body telling me I need to stop, and If i don't listen to my body then who or what else is there to listen to :)

But I have a question for you all- did you have sleeping difficulties aswell when quitting?
It's hard to fall asleep.. Rollin around in my bed for an hour or two until I fall asleep.
Any tips from you?

New username just for this (well, several things, but quitting smoking is a big one). Subbed to this, stop drinking, motivation subs, personal finance, etc.. I'm starting tomorrow with patches. Half a pack a day or so for 12 years.

I've tried in the past, and that's an average #, there was a few years of a pack a day, a few of nearly quitting, etc.. 

So this is it. 

I'm scared but doing this for good. I'm 31, this needs to be done now.

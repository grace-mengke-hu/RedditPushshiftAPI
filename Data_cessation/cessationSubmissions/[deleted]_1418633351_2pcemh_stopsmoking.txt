The longest I made it :)

Just thought I would post here to say that this is the longest I have ever made it not smoking, and I smoked for 24 years, starting at 13.  I feel kind of proud of myself today and just wanted to share.

Interesting side note, I ordered a pizza tonight with all the money that seems to be staying in my account now that I am not smoking and the guy that came to the door smelled of smoke and, not to sound all high and mighty here, but it was another reminder to me of why I do not want to smoke, the after smell.

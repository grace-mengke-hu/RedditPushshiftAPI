Trying with vape but need help guys...

This is a question for anyone that vapes or uses vaping to quit...

I bought a really good ecig last week and I like the sensation more than smoking so was doing really well. I did not even like cigarettes after using my ecig for full days. So think it's the right way for me to quit...

However, I've been getting really bad diorhea. I bought the second weakest liquid I could get. 0.6, as when I tried in the past I had a similar problem with the mid strength liquid of 1.8.

There is only one liquid strength weaker at 0.3. I wonder if I'm allergic to something in the liquid? I just wondered if anyone had had a similar experience and got over it? I really don't want to give up on the ecig, but also can't be running to the toilet 5 times urgently...

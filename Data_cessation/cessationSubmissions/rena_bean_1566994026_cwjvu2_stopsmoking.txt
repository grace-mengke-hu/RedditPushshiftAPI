I woke up this morning with a heavy chest, again. Decided today was the day and put on a nicotine patch.

I'm tired of struggling to breathe. I'm tired of trying to figure out what to do with my son while i hack a butt. He's 10 months old today and starting to get around very quickly.  Im gonna need to keep up to him! I need to do this for him. There will always be stress, I'm just going to have to find a better way of dealing with it. This will be the 50-somethingth time I've tried to quit, hopefully the last. I see screenshots of an app a lot in here, can anyone point me in the right direction? All my family and friends smoke, so i could use some support :)

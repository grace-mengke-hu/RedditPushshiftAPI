Disgusted with myself.

Last night I ran out of cigarettes, so I went out and collected butts with the intention of taking out the tobacco and rerolling it. I wish I could say that I stopped there but I didn't. Quite a few of those dirty bastards later I am utterly disgusted with myself. I throw what was left out and I pray that my will lasts.

Didn't smoke yesterday at all on account of a raging hangover. This morning I figured I'd keep it up and crumpled the last of my pack into the garbage...

I've been here before, and the one time I made it more than a month I was astounded by how much more energy I had. Like I felt like I had double energy. No more having to sit down and feel the weight of my limbs like lead. I thought that was just how life was. No more feeling shaky and weak after a smoke, but somehow convincing myself I felt more energized or less stressed.  My hands and clothes and hair didn't stink, I didn't have to apologize to friends for smoke blowing in their faces accidentally, or to excuse myself and return not being able to tell but knowing I smelled awful. 

I am looking forward to being free again.  

I know right now I feel accomplished, proud and ready to take it on, but I know that the cravings will hit soon and I'll think I can't make it without buying a pack. I have a lot of anxiety about the prospect never GETTING to smoke again... Scary! But I know that's just nicotine talking it's lies. I should be happy I never HAVE to smoke again. Reframing it is hard. 

Smokes only clear the fog that was created in their absence. Once you leave them behind the fog clears for good. 

Good luck to everyone out there working towards the same.

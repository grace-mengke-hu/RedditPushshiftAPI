Randomly craving again... why?

Hey Reddit, 
So about 2-3 years ago I stopped smoking cigarettes completely. Throughout the years I'll randomly be like hey I want one! But nothing has ever been this bad. 
I just raided my sisters room trying to find one but all I could find were lighters and I was INCREDIBLY close to getting in the car and getting a pack. 
Anyone know how to stop this? It's been almost 3 years... like c'mon. This is supposed to be over :(

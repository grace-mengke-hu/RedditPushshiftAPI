Two weeks, but damn... it's hard

It has been two weeks since I smoked my last cigarette. It was nog easy altough the last two/three days I barely had any problems. Tonight is very different, had a couple of beers because it's my roommate's birthday/ I'm afraid I will smoke when we go out. I want a cigaret so bad and am actually looking forward to smoking. Has anybody had a similar experience and how did you manage it?

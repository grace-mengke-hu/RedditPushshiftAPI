already noticing the changes

NOTE: To those of you hate e-cigs b/c you think nicotine is evil, or who don't consider getting on the e-cig bandwagon to be "really quitting," i really don't care. find someone else to troll.

Switched to an e-cig two days ago, and smoked my last real cig yesterday. After only a day, I've already noticed several welcome changes. my perma-sore throat is gone, I'm not bundling up to go out for a cig every hour, I now have 2 usable cupholders in my car now that i no longer need an ashtray, and by the end of the week, my $60 e-cig starter kit will have been paid for by the money i would have been spending on smokes.  also, now that i can get my fix inside, I've become really good at blowing vapor-rings!

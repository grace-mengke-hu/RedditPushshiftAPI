Recovered from an eating disorder, but can't quit smoking!

I'm so frustrated. I'm 31 years old and have had 3 1/2 years free from my eating disorder. I started smoking when I was 10! Ugh. I have been smoking on average a pack a day for about 18 years with only 6 months free when I was 15. 

I began dating the man I want to marry one year ago. He's a non-smoker and extremely supportive. He isn't "the" reason I want to quit, but admittedly he's the reason I want to try harder. He won't leave me, but I want to live the best life I can. 

The reason I brought up the eating disorder is I'm wondering if anyone else out there has been through the same process? Overcoming one addiction and/or mental health disease to only have another huge obstacle in your way of optimal health.

My latest trying is decreasing the amount I'm smoking. For the past 7 days I've had less than a half a pack each day except for 11 yesterday. My experience with recovery gives me the knowledge of having a plan in place when triggers arise, but that never makes it any easier, right? Knowing is one thing, but overcoming the physical hold and anxiety it produces is a whole other battle. 

Any support is greatly appreciated.

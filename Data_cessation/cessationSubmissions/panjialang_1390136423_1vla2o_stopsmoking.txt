Quit for 500+ days, started again for 3+ months...i'm putting an end to it once again today - back on the wagon!

never. take. another. puff.

I originally read Allen Carr's book and it did wonders for me, so much that after 500 days I thought that smoking was a stupid thing confined to my past.  I was so completely over it that I never even thought about it, and had overcome being around smoking, even when drunk at bars, and not smoking for so long that I never thought it would be a problem again.

Fast forward to October, my wife was out of town and I had some days off work, so I got together with my friends and in the spirit of the festivities decided to enjoy some smokes.  Slowly but surely it snuck its way into my life until I was again smoking with complete abandon at bars, even bumming some at work from time to time.

It started so innocently that I didn't even want to reset my badge, but eventually I did - months ago!  And again today.

I even started telling myself that I couldn't quit smoking, that I needed to smoke, that I couldn't quit again not now, not with everything going on in my life!  All the old tricks were back again in full force, like I had never even quit before for so long...

Finally and thankfully I realized that all this anxiety I've had recently is DUE TO smoking and not aided by it.  I'm feeling it in the gym.  I'm anxious about my health.  I can't handle pressure as well as I used.  I have my first child on the way and now's the time.

Wish me luck!

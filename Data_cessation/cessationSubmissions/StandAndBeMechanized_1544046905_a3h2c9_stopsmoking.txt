Cravings all of the Sudden

Hey gang, I have been smoke free since October 7th (my flair here is from a prior attempt, I shall fix). All of the sudden, after nearly two months, I am being inundated with cravings. Same old triggers, too. Post food, post coitus, work, stress, driving, waking up, boredom, etc. 

I am doing just fine, I know I won't start again. But the timing of it is puzzling to me. These cravings are so strong and so out of left field that even my Smoke Free app on my phone seemed puzzled when I entered my first craving in a long time. Anyone else experienced this?

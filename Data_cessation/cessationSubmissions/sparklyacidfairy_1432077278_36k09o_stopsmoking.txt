Day 3 - 3rd time

Okay. I'm on day three. I had my last cigarette, a gold American Spirit on the balcony of the resort I stayed at in Cancun. 

I quit this year for three months (Dec 2014-March 2015)
I quit last year for three months (Jan 2014 - March 2014)

Reasons: I developed asthma from smoking. I've had maybe 5 respiratory illnesses in the last 6 months. Bronchitis, sinus infections, the works... My body cannot do it anymore. Smoking is my enemy, the one that I slept with. It is a vicious cycle that comes with chains to habits I dislike. I don't want to be wrinkly and smelly, I want to stay fresh and dewy like a flower. 

Day 3: I'm angry. Again. Last time I was so angry at the world when I quit. I don't want to be angry, so I guess I'll have to finally learn how to deal with the world, rather than hiding in a fume of shit with the devil.

Day 1: I slipped (again)

Tomorrow's another day, right? Disappointed w/ myself, but ah well.

August last year, I tried to stop smoking for the first time in ten years. I slipped six months later while drinking w/ a friend, thinking that having one stick wouldn't be so disastrous given my 6-month discipline. I was wrong————. Went back to chain smoking up to four packs a day. &amp; then today happened. 

Today I decided to quit again. Mainly because I knew I could do it. There's only one rule to stick to, anyway: Never look back, never go far that one last smoke. But I did. 

To anyone who's thinking of that last stick, please don't. It won't be the last.

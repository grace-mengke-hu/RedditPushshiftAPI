I must have bloody reeked

5 weeks smoke free, was over a friend's house for new year's. People were smoking inside but I didn't let it bother me.

Woke up the next morning and went to put on the shirt I was wearing from the night before and I couldn't believe how bad it stank! Threw it in the wash straight away as it was unbearable 

Asked my gf 'jesus did I always smell like this?' and her reply was 'yeah' . Fuck I don't know how she put up with it

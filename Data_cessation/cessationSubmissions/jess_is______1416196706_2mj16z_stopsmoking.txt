Mark it zero.

I quit quitting. I know, I know. Save the lecture. 

I feel horrible about it. 

Let me tell you how it happened so maybe you can avoid the same mistakes I made. 

I was 5 months quit. The smell of a cigarette was horrible, the taste was even worse. 

Then I went on vacation for 6 weeks. For five weeks I rode my high horse and didn't even waiver once. 
Then I got mad, and drunk and said fuck it. I am going to smoke. If you would know me, this is my way of rebelling. It is like saying, "HEY ASSHOLE LOOK HOW MUCH YOU SUCK, I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF WITH THESE CANCER STICKS BECAUSE YOU PISSED ME OFF"

I thought it was just for a night. 
The next day came and I didn't smoke. Ok good, no problem. 
Days went by and I could feel the nudge of the cravings. Clawing at the back of my mind. "Look" i said to myself. "You can be a casual smoker, you went on a binge but you came back, whats the harm in having one, once in a while." 
Once in a while turned into one a night. 
One a night turned into two. 
Then it turned into "lets see how many cigarettes I can fucking chain smoke"

I am now smoking more than before I quit. That is how shitty I am. 

I will quit again, but it won't be now. Now I am reveling in my stench and my guilt. Wallowing in self pity and just feeling like shit. My throat hurts, and I am short of breath after running up a flight of stairs. 

I will quit again. Just...not now. So mark my flair at zero or take it away. Whatever.

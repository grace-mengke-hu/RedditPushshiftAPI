24 hours without smoking !

So.. 24 hours huh? Yeah I'm sitting with some friends outside and they are smoking ..alot . It feels great that I don't have the same habits as they have but a little bothersome when a girl keeps blowing smoke at my face on purpose and I really don't want to inhale any of the smoke . Bye bye bad habit ! And I promise to be honest to myself and you guys !

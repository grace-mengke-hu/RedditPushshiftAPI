Weekend Triggers

This is a my second weekend of not smoking and it has brought a whole new set of triggers! Last night we had a drink and a couple rounds of gambling at the casino. I was worried I would cave, but I stayed strong and had my guard up the whole time. After that we went to a bar with a lovely patio filled with outside smokers. I had fun observing the other smokers and feeling proud that I could enjoy the sunshine and not smoke. There were other things: just walking around downtown, sitting outside while we waited for a table at the restaurant, walking through the park. It was such a fantastic night, and I didn't smoke once! Hope everyone else is getting through the weekend successfully!!

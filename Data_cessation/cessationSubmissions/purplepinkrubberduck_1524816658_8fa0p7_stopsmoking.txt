Over and over again

I go days. Sometimes weeks without smoking and then have a bad day and smoke a pack. I need to stop. I joke myself and tell myself I am not officially a smoker because I may only do this once a week. Is anyone like this?  How do you get through the crutch. I could easily quit but it is like I am breaking up with an old friend I hang out with once a week

I guess I just need to realize the friend is bad and just rip off the band aid. For example, the last time I smiled was 6 days ago and before that was two weeks.  It isnâ€™t the withdrawal or the other factors. I am easily able to put it up and down (in the sense of a daily ah it) it is the long term. Does anyone have any advice?  How can I get it through my brain that I have to just drop it?

Found this sub from my Quit Smoking App

Cigarettes have been the bane of my life! I’ve only been smoking since I was 18 (22 now) but they always made me feel down. 

I’ve been using my ecig lately and it’s been 11 days without a cigarette, the longest I’ve gone! 

I do get days where I crave for them but since I may have an issue with my heart, that’s been a big driving push for my quit! 

Hope all you other quitters are doing great on this incredibly difficult journey!

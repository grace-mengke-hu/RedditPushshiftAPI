Please help me quit

I quit once for a few years but when I found out my wife was having an affair I reached for cigarettes not booze. Its been a long time now and I cant seem to stop. My gf wants me to quit, and so do I. I work in construction and even if I dont buy them they are offered to me. As an addict its almost impossible to say no. Im 32 and its effecting my health and Im afraid its going to kill me. If you could be kind enough to shoot me a PM encouraging me in any way it would really help a lot. My gf is only around 3 days a week and doesnt pressure me at all, even though i know its important to her as well. Other than her I dont have any close friends or family living near by.

Day 11

The last couple of evenings I have really had some cravings. Last night especially. Which I think is because the kiddos went to their dads and usually when they are away I smoke in the house and Netflix. So. I’m not sure it was a craving for smoking as much as the routine that had become my weekend evenings. I’m also getting ready to start and that helps nothing at all. 

I am enjoying not smoking though. Even with some of the absolutely uncomfortable side effects of quitting, the unpleasantness of it all is still better than smoking. I’ve finally told people I stopped smoking. 

My 14-year old is so damned happy that I think if I smoked at this point it would taste like guilt. 

I’ve been trying to use this 7-minute workout app I downloaded a hundred years ago and never used. It is helpful when I’m home and craving. I don’t give it my all everything but the movement is nice, distraction and a reminder of the sad shape of my lungs certainly fuels the “just keep swimming” mindset. 

This forum is super super helpful. Thank you all for “hearing” me, and each other. Happy Saturday!!! 😁😁🎉

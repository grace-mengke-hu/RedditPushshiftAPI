Day 50!

Wow I canâ€™t believe I made it this far! I remember the anxiety I used to feel about the thought of not having a cigarette for a whole day!!! and now Iâ€™m on day 50! I never plan to smoke again. Iâ€™m pretty proud of myself. I walk with extra pep in my step for sure!

For everyone out there that just quit on the first! IT GETS BETTER! Good luck! ðŸ¤—

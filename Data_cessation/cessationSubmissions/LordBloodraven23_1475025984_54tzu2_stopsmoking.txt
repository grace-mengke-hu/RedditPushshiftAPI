Question for all smokers/ex smokers

I used to smoke 2 packs for almost 9 years, my willpower is shitty so i never succeded without a smoke for more then a few days, so i tried a different approach, smoking 40 cigs a day after a week became 39 (of course sometimes i smoked less, but i tried to never go over 39) and now after more then a year i am down to 5 cigs a day with no cravings at all. Problem is as u can see, after 35 weeks of cutting it by one, when i came to five a day, i got so scared and decided to stay at 5. 90% of time i am at 5, no more no less, sometimes if i stay up longer there comes the 6th, and if i stay up longer plus i am drunk as fuck even 7th. I m not obsessed about it as may it seem, those 5 come pretty naturally, after i wake up and after meals. I know the hard truth, once i will slip and it will went to 20, 30 and back to 40, but it has been about 4 months that i am at 5 i just dont have a strong reason to quit now when i smoke so little, like i had when i was at 2 packs. Money which was biggest reason to start with seems irelevant now, i smoke only by the window so my flat doesnt smell like it used to nor my clothes etc. I never had trouble with sport activites even at 40 a day cause i am regular gym member plus playing football (soccer) and basketball few times a week since i am 15 so no reason in that also. Question is do you believe its possible to keep that 5 a day or do you think its matter of time before i start smoking much more again? Sry for long post.

Just about 60 hours nic free

Me and my boyfriend are trying to quit, he’s been smoking and vaping for quite a few years now so he’s taking chantix to help him but I’ve been vaping (regularly) for about a year so I’m trying to do it on my own. I’ve been cutting down the past month so when I finally quit I would have less withdraw. I’m starting my third day nic free and I’ve heard it’s the worst day, any pieces of advice?

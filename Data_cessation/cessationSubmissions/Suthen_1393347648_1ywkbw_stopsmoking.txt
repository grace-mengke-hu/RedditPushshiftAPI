3 weeks today!

I just found this sub, wish I would have found it sooner! I was a smoker for 15 years, only ever quit twice. I was busy reproducing, two kids. I went cold turkey, and I heart toothpicks. My children are my driving force. I've came close to breaking, then I think about facing the wrath of my 9 yo. Then I'm good haha. How do you distract yourselves? I've heard nightmares of folks gaining weight because they eat more now. Has that been a problem for anyone?

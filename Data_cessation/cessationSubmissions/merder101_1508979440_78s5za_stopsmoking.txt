Trying to quit

So I've been a smoker for several years now and I want to quit. I've quit on and off before (haven't we all). I've quit smoking at work and am now stuck in a cycle of smoking at home. My fiancée and our roommate both smoke and it's made my resolve difficult. I need advice on how any of you have ever kept the momentum going when your constantly around others who smoke. I haven't bought a pack myself in at least a month, maybe two. I break down and smoke a couple when my fiancé gets home. I'm worried I'll fall back in to old habits and before long I'll be back to my pack a day habit. Any advice would be really helpful. Thanks!!

Work crisis

I just deleted a week's worth of work from my computer, no backup. The deadline is tomorrow and there's nothing I can do except face the consequences tomorrow. It hasn't even sinked in yet.
But I will not smoke. Right now I want to say fuck it and have a drink. I'm not craving a cigarette but I can see I'm about to enter a very dangerous, rationalisation prone territory. I'm posting to remind myself I DON'T WANT TO SMOKE no matter what I tell myself later.

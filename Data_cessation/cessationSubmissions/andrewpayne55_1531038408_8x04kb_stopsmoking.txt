Made it to Day 4, the cravings are a lot worse today.

Made it to Day 4, feeling pretty proud however today I am feeling the cravings a lot more than I have for the last few days. Tomorrow I am going to a rock concert and I know that I will be surrounded by people drinking and smoking but I don't want to cave. Any suggestions/motivations to help me stay strong?

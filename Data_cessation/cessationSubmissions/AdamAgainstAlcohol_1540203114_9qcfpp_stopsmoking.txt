Don't replace smoking with drinking

I have now been off cigarettes for well over a year, and the difference is huge. Although I still crave a cigarette from time to time it is easily replaced by getting some regular fresh air and a bit of mindfulness. My anxiety is better, I don't stink, I have better skin, my breathing has improved dramatically.

I can recall that feeling of craving a cigarette. The heavy head, adrenaline in wrists, agitation. I can recall the instant relief of a cigarette. I'm glad not to experience that anymore.

However, I have become somewhat addicted to alcohol. Too often my after work cigarette became after work wine. And giving up alcohol once you're dependent, is in my experience at least, worse than giving up smoking. The cravings are really similar and I think one addiction can easily transfer onto another.

What to do when waiting for the bus?

After i smoked a whole pack at a party and my mouth tasting like i licked the ashtray i decided to quit smoking. This week has been good so far, altough i'm tempted to buy a pack whenever i have to use public transportation. Before i would think to myself: "Oh, 5 minutes until the bus arrives, perfect time for a cigarette." Now i don't really know what to do. Any tips to keep me occupied during the waiting time?

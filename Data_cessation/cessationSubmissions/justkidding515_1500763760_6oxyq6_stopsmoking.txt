Quitting hot Turkey

I posted here a few months ago about quitting. I failed. But I am trying again. 

I decided to quit on a trip overseas to Turkey. I am an American who went with a bunch of non smokers to Turkey. It's been a bit rough. I'm sleep deprived and over caffeinated  (Turkish coffee is delicious btw). 

Today is my 7 day mark. 7 days with no cigarettes. The problem is that pretty much any where you go here, someone is smoking. I'm craving one pretty badly. I'm also afraid that when I head back for the state's in a few days that I will fall back into old habits. I want to quit. I want to quit. I want to quit. That's my mantra. Any encouragement is greatly appreciated.

115 Days - with 2 relapses

I've had two days in the past 115 that I've smoked. the first relapse I'd had a few too many drinks, was on day 60 or so, and had two cigarettes at a bar. The second time was at a friends birthday party on March 4th (again, alcohol related. It's definitely a trigger and I'm totally aware. I had to quit drinking for two weeks when I originally quit smoking because I'd lose all willpower), and I probably had about 5 cigarettes that day. 

My question? Should I restart my badge? Cravings are becoming less and less frequent, and with ever decreasing intensity. I know this it for me, I'm done. Am I doing myself any favors by keeping my 115 day badge? 

What are you thoughts on relapses and when to restart the clock?

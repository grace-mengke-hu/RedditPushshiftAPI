Figuring out why I started smoking

I've quit smoking for a little over 30 days, cold turkey. Looking back upon my teens, twenties, and thirties... why did I start smoking? I think that is the most important part, why did you start smoking? Was it to be cool? Apparently, that was my motivation. I thought I was sexy. I thought I was smarter. It ends up that people think you're lazy and stupid.... at least the people that matter.

After quitting, physical nicotine addiction is supposed to be over after a month, but your brain is too smart for its own good. You have an addict brain and it will go after all your baser instincts. Dreaming about smoking? That's your brain. Feeling anxious? That's your brain. Are you feeling a loss? That's your brain. The brain is an amazing organ, but when you've (me) have been screwing around with all the rewarding neuroreceptors, the journey to recovery is a bit harder.

The non-smoker goal is obtainable. I'm in the process of quitting, and so can you. You can stop being an addict to a substance that harms you and does nothing for you.

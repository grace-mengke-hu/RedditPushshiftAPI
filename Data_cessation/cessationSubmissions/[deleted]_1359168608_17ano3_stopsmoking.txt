My first big success as a quitter!

Last night was like any other "Thirsty Thursday" in that my friends and I all went out drinking. Naturally I was intoxicated when I was standing outside and was offered to hit my friend's cigarette. I took it from her hand, looked at it for 5 seconds and handed it back telling her I couldn't do it because I had just quit. Every other attempt I've made at quitting has failed because of smoking while drinking but not this time!

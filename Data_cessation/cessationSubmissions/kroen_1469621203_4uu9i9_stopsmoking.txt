Exchanged smoking with gaming

I've quit smoking 45 hours ago, but a couple of days beforehand I treated myself to an Xbox One. 

TBH I've been itching to game for years now, ever since my PC became outdated, and even though Xbox One is way cheaper than a low-end gaming PC here (Israel) I couldn't afford both it and cigarettes. 

So a day before smoking my last pack I decided that my money would be better spent (and enjoyed) on gaming rather than smoking, so I bought Xbox One and Doom, and I have to say, it's been very helpful in getting my mind off smoking. 

P.S. I also ordered the 4 Gears of War games (Ultimate+2+3+Judgment) which were dirt cheap because of how old they (relatively) are. I have to say, I'm much more excited to delve into them than I ever was about smoking. Doom is pretty excellent too.

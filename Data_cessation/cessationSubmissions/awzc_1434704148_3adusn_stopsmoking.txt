How do you feel?

Hi guys,

4 days in here, and feeling optimistic about having finally stopped for good. I've browsed this thread quite a lot, and it's great seeing people post about how proud they are about getting to a milestone. What I would love to see in addition to this is a thread where people post about how they physically and mentally feel now after having quit - I feel this would be a really good motivator for people when they're wondering if it's worth stopping or not!

So, if you are reading this, I'd love to hear how long you've stopped for and the biggest changes you've felt as a result of this!

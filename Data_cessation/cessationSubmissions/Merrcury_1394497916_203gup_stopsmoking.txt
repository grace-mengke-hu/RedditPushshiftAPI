Chewing this damn gum... after smoking two B&Ms...

I'm sick of the yes or no of quitting. I enjoy smoking. I want to smoke so I can enjoy the outdoors with a good book, a pen and paper. 

Alternatives have been disappointing to say the least.

I've got the gum, a few carts left on my Blu(the only few that weren't defective), and I don't want to say no.

I lost my last job while quitting. Manager told me I may have ADD. I read up that nicotine helps suppress the symptoms.

I haven't been able to write since I've stopped my packs.

But I've also gained sleep. A bit of confidence too... 

I don't know where to stand. I just don't want to be in the middle.

I know which side you guys are on, but I wanna hear voices from both sides. Let's talk about both for once.

Weak

I smoked yesterday. 

My girlfriend called me weak today after she learned I had smoked. I used to smoke a pack a day when we started dating almost five years ago. I have been really struggling to not have one "every once in a while" since then. Quitting has been really hard. Today I'm saying I'm done for good again, and I hope it's the last time. Wish me luck. I know I can do it.

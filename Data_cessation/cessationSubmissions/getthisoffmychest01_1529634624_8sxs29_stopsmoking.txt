13 Weeks In, After long painful 5 weeks of chest cold, acute bronchitis, sinus, and GERD, I can finally breathe easily again today.

This is my 3rd updates of my quitting journey.

You never realise how good it feels to breathe easily, until you've got a respiratory problem. Good thing that I only have a handful of acute illnesses. 

Go easy on your body after you quit! Be kind to yourself and realise that it takes time for your body to recover. I've never felt so shitty in my entire life than those 12 weeks. Shocked my body by quitting cold turkey, stress level went up through the roof. Exacerbated by the fact I had to quit caffeine too because of my acid reflux, especially coffee and tea.

Anyhow, I'm so happy that I can breathe normally again today. Don't give up guys, I know you can make it! Writing a public journal like this also helps you out a lot by distracting your mind and gives you time to reflect your journey so far.

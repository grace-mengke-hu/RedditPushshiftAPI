Day 7. I have more energy, can breathe deeply, I have less desire to drink alcohol or espresso.

I just want to get this out there.   I am 36yo / 20 year smoker on Quit Day 7.  Umpteenth time quitting.  This time no NRT (i.e.. Cold Turkey) and no drinking.  I'm making some real progress.   I may have had a drinking problem, where I would consume a lot of alcohol each evening after work.  I also drank a stupid amount of coffee, something like 12 cups of espresso a day.  The more I smoked, the more coffee I wanted.  The more coffee I wanted, the more cigarettes I needed.  Then at the end of the day, I could easily have 3 or 4 glasses of whiskey before bed. I have no drive to do anything productive in the evening and I'd wake up morning feeling groggy, tired and coughing my lungs out.

Now, as I escape this nicotine addiction, I notice the obvious health benefits already;  Not coughing anymore, breathing deeply, oral hygiene improved, no stink.  But a more acute observation I've noticed is that with the halt of my nicotine intake, my desire to 'have a drink or two' at the end of the day is gone.  My habit to drink at least 12 espresso's a day has been reduced to something like 3 espressos a day.  I get a good sleep and wake up fresh.  I can concentrate and focus.  I'm alert.  I feel productive in the evenings.  I feel great!

What I'm saying is, that the inner strength, willpower, self control that I am developing to stop smoking is also, maybe somehow allowing me to control my other habits.    Could this be true?  Do others have the same observations?

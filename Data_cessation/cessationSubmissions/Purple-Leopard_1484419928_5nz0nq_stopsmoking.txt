Four years since I quit on the 7th

Just wanted to celebrate a bit on here. Been doing great since, although I still miss the appetite suppressant aspect of it. A lot. Has made losing weight more difficult.

Drives me nuts though, I spend a lot of time with my father and he is a chain smoker. A chain smoker that barely rolls the window down when I'm riding in the car with him. Makes me pretty stick to my stomach tbh, I also end up wanting to start up a bit as well but I think I'm mostly ok.

Sport while trying to stop?

So after 5 years i finally decided that i'm finishing this addiction since i have been only smoking on and off the last few day and think i am ready to abandon this guilty pleasure of mine. 

I didn't read up on any tips to help me stop, except some of the threads here yet. I could already feel how much stuff i'm coughing up but other than that i was feeling alright.

I'm wondering if any of you guys started doing any kind of sport while stopping to smoke or maybe even use it as a replacement?

Day #20. Caved when meeting with old friends. There is no such thing as ‘just one cigarette”

Quit at new year, and was using NRT (gum, lozenges). Did ok until Saturday night (day 20) with old friends, none of whom currently smoke. Someone decided that we should buy a pack and all have one cigarette for old times sake. I caved due to peer pressure. Ended up having three that evening. Woke up next morning with a heavy chest and that early morning craving feeling. 

Anyway - One of my friends had stayed over and still had the pack left with him. We ended up sharing the rest of the pack on the Sunday. (About 6 left)

So - now it’s Monday morning. I’ve re-watched the Alan Carr video, and have reset my quit date. I’m throwing out all the NRT and doing this properly! 

Cravings from now on will be *enjoyable* as I will smile because the little fucker inside me is being starved to death. No more nicotine in any form. Not one more puff, suck, vape or chew ever!!!!

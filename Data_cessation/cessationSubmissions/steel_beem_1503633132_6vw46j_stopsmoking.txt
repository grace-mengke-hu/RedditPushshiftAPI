Don't know what I'm doing

I'm young, started smoking last year decided to quit, started vaping but it's still so hard to quit even though it's been a little over a month and honestly I wish I never started, I just hate thinking I'm controlled by nicotine. Will I ever not crave cigarettes? And how will I get over this feeling of wanting one?

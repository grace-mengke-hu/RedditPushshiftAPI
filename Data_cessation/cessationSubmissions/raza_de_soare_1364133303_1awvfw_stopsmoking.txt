I just had my last cigarette.

After 9 months of smoking (triggered by some stressful events) from 5 cigarettes to a pack per day, I decided it's time to stop. I think I need a thread like this to keep me going, because most of my friends are smokers and I'm pretty sure they will try to 'help me out' with a cigarette or two. 

I realized I forgot how I thought cigarettes were disgusting and that smoking won't fix my social and anxiety problems. I already feel comfortable enough in a crowded place like a bar, without feeling the need to smoke. If I'm sitting at the table alone, waiting for my friends, I can draw, write something, or play something on my phone.

Now I think I need to catch up with some old non-smoker friends I haven't talked to in a long time, just to have a break from temptations. :)

Wish me luck!

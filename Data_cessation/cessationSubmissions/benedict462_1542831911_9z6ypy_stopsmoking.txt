Experiencing the growing nicotine Dragon

Ok.  Why replacements arent working for me.  Maybe the do for some of you...but here is my experience.  I was just under a pack a day light cigarettes for a couple decades.  No major cough, health problems.  Wanted to stop, so...

Enter Copenhagen and swedish snus.  Much more nicotine, get off cigs.  Not healthy but better than smoke.  I lived in rural America, its more common.  Dip all you want, at least your not smoking.  Take care of your mouth.  Then...

Relapsed back to smoking.  This time bc I dipped i was smoking almost 2 packs a day!  Wanted to quit smoking again, so...

Enter Juul and vaping.  Easy peasy, easy to quit smoking.  Vape all you want says the guy at the vape shops as they shake out of their bones taking in gargantuan amounts of nicotine.  So i did.  No cravings for smoke!  Thats cuz I prob tripled my nic intake.  If I were to start smoking it would probably be more than 2 packs a day now.  All this harm reduction stuff has made me a nicotine fiend, worse than when I was an actual smoker!

Thats why I neee to stop.  Everything.  Replacements never work for me, they make it worse.

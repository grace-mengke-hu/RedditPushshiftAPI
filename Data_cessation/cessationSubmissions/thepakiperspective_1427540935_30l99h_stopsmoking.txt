So pissed at myself right now

I messed up real bad, after nearly two months of having quit (w/ 2mg nicorette, which I had phased out by the end of the first month). I was stuck at home for a couple of days and unwell and as soon as my daily routine broke, I found myself smoking again! Over three-four days, smoked two packs (maybe closer to three?). I'm so angry and sad right now.. really thought this would be the time I quit for real.

I've gotten another pack of gum and just broken the rest of the cigarettes I had with me. Really don't want to go back to being a smoker.

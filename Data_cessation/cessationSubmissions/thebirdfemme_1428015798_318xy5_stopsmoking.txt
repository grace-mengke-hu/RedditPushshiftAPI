take a walk

this phrase has never been so relevant to me. My job is mostly fine and most of the people whom i work with are fine. There's two guys I cannot fucking stand and they are terrible to work with and as a result make ME look bad. Honestly they make me seriously consider quitting, but that's life and I have to deal with them.

Anywho getting to the point. Usually when I'd get pissed off at them I'd go out for a cigarette. Now I just tell myself to take a walk to calm down. It works haha does basically the same thing as a cigarette (getting me away for a minute), except now it's not negative.

So, take a walk guys! :)

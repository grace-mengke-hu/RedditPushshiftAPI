It's finally time to kick it for good.

I would like to prelude this with a note, this will be a wall of text as I'm writing this as sort of a journal entry of sorts to look back on. 

Today I've decided to turn my life around. I'm a 19 year old male, I've been smoking for 5 years now and I will be starting college in approximately three weeks. I'm tired of the amount of money I spend on smoking...

To be honest I don't know why I started. I remember riding to school everyday with my "friends" who would always smoke. But why would friends let me pick up such a bad habit. Occasionally I would smoke with them and then next thing I know here I am smoking two packs a day... Marlboro 27's at $5 a pack even. $10 a day, $70 a week, $280 a month, and $3360 a year. Fucking ridiculous if you ask me.

I've gone through every hoop and hurdle to avoid my family knowing... my mom makes comments when she occasionally smells smoke on me but I blame it on friends and they've believed me for 5 years.

I'm tired of snooping around and I'm tired of that amount of money I am spending. Today is the day I turn my life around. I'm going to stop smoking, stop masturbating, start working out, and make something of my life. I applaud all you who have quit before me and I hope this time sticks for good. I've tried quitting multiple times before but never with this amount of resolve...

Wish me luck. Best of luck to all you as well!

Former Chronic Relapsers

To all you former chronic relapsers, what quit actually stuck and what did you do differently to finally quit?  I have had so many “quit days” that they’ve lost all purpose and meaning at this point.   Desperately want to stay a non-smoker but I always inevitably cave and I’m struggling to stay on track.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

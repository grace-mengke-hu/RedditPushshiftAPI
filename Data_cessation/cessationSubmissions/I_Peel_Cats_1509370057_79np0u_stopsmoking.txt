Quitting again

This time I have mild bronchitis helping me want to quit.  Also I made a bet with my friend that if I smoke before 2018 comes, I pay him 2000, If he smokes he pays me 2000.  Last time I bet him, it was for 1000 we both quit for 1 year (nobody got paid we both won!) I continued  no drinking to this day, and weed  and ciggaretes until about six month ago.  I gotta drop this shitty, stinky, life ending, girl repelling, money pit habit!!!

Currently pack a day and anywhere from 1 -4 sugar free rockstars.  Weighing 315 pounds.

Let me know if anyone has any suggestions as to what help them quit and STAY quit.

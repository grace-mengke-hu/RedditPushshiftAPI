30yr smoker, at 60 hours, exactly half way through day three

Last cig was Friday around 9:30am. Didn't really think about giving up, but I've had a persistent bad cough for months now. It wakes me up in the middle of the night several times. Often things like this happen to me because of smoking, so I thought why not lay off smoking for as long as possible and see if my throat heals up a little.

Well, I got through to Saturday morning, thought what the hell and carried on. Here I am Sunday night. I can confirm what many people say the third day is the worst. The cravings have been strong today. They've been so bad that I was googling how long they last, and found this sub.

So, day 4 starts tomorrow at 9:30am. Some people say after 72 hours things start easing off. Is this true?

**EDIT:** Woke up today with upvotes and a bunch of replies. Thanks to everyone for your support. Was in a low place last night and today I feel renewed. Day 4 here I come...

Made it to 90 days. Thank You all.

Hey r/stopsmoking, I'm usually a lurker here but today I wanted to announce that it's been 90 days since my last cigarette and I owe a large portion of my success to this community. The support, strategies, and tools I've gotten from being in this community have helped me on my journey greatly and I know they will in the future as well. Thank you all!

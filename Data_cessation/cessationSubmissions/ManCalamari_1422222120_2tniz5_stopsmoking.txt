Alright, I could use some advice

I'm on day 2 without a smoke right now and it's been less than fun to say the least. I've been alternating chewing zonnic and regular gum and drinking a lot of water. Do you guys think I should stop the zonnic and just try to power through it without any nicotine? Also, any other tips for curbing my cravings?

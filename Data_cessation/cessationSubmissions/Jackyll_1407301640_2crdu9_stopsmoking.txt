Not even 24 hours yet, but I have a question.

When trying to quit, is it normal for my anger/agitation level to peak then drop off randomly?   About 30 minutes ago I got super pissy for no reason at the wife (she ended that real quick) but then like 10 minutes later the feeling stopped.  I'm hoping it's just a temporary side effect, but just wanted to ask.

I'm 1 week away from 2 months!

Holy fuck, I never thought I'd see the day. I was smoking a pack a day and everyday I would just be thinking about how much I needed to quit, but then within an hour I'd light up another. One day before work I just said, "fuck it, this is my last cigarette." And it was! August 25th at 8:55 am. After the first 3 days everything just started going uphill and it still is. Never once after the 3 days have I thought I was going to cave. I've quit twice in the past and never made it half this far. And I feel amazing! I still cough occasionally but I still feel 100x better than when I smoked. My favorite part of not smoking is the mental clarity I have. Rather than living with the thought of "alright, when's my next cigarette?" I can focus on just living. Life isn't meant the be lived depending on stupid little white sticks you burn and inhale the smoke from.

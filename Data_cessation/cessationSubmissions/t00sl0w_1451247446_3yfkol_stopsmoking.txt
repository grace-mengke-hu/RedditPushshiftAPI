Decided today is the day

Smoking is smoking I know, but I'm one of the rarer people "I think" that have smoked for a long time but never broke 2-3 cigs a day and really only after supper....it was like my, "end of the day" chill. After work, after the final meal, just go outside and have a couple to bleed off the daily grind BS. Well, lately I've been kind of viewing myself while smoking and getting annoyed....like, "why am I doing this?" I've gone days to a week on vacation, etc as I never smoke when I go off and its never bothered me...
It's just this dumb ritual I do, for no reason it seems like.

I don't think it'll be easy once I breach the "days" I regularly go because it has been a ritual for like 10yrs....but, if I can just create a new one I think I'll be good....i hope at least. So, lets see what happens!! I'm kind of excited actually.

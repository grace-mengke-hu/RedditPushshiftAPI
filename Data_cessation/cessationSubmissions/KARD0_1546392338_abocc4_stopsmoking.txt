I hate myself

I hate the fact that i start every day with i will not smoke and im bombarded by cravings i hate myself or that little tiny part of my brain saying "you will focus even better without smoking" but another part of my brain saying "you cannot focus without smoking" i hate myself for repeating the same mistake over and over again of smoking i go 12 hours without it and then i just submit i really hate that about myself why can't i be normal again is it because all members of my family are smokers no definitely not you should take responsibility of your mistakes its no ones fault but yet again its fucking annoying that you have to deal with smoke all over the house yes i know what you should do you should move out except youre not living in a developed country where its possible to do that and despite the face that youre 21 moving out and living independently is considered something weird i hate all of this January 2018 i said to myself that i will get over this i will quit smoking definitely without a doubt you can do it it's your year except i didnt do that at all you're so in control of your life in every other aspect why not this i dont get it i hate myself

Timing when I should stop smoking. Thoughts?

Hi everyone, 

I read EASYWAY last year and stopped smoking for 6 months. I will readily admit that I am a dumbass. When life became unusually stressful (my grandma got really sick) - I thought smoking would fix it. It didn't and I've wanted to stop since. That said, I've found myself going through the same emotions I felt the first (and only) time I quit smoking. Nervousness, anxiety, etc. 

Well, I made the decision to reread EASYWAY. I got about halfway through when I needed to have some dental work done. I have been smoke free for 2 days, as per the dentist's orders.

 I guess I wanted a bit more "ceremony" behind stubbing out my last cigarette. Instead my last cigarette was spent just dicking around on my phone. I am wondering, should I finish rereading EASYWAY and capitalize on this smoke-free "head start" I got? Should I just let go of the idea of "timing?" and get on with my new smoke free life? 

Thanks :)

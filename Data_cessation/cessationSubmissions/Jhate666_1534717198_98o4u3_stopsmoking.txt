5 days in. Should I keep going with the patches? Who else misses that kick in the chest?

I feel like I really miss that inhaling action the burning the kick in the chest that you get when smoking. It feels like my lungs are craving it right now. I havenâ€™t had a patch on in 4 hours. Should I keep with it or is that just a crutch and go cold turkey from here?

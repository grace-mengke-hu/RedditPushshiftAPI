no cigarettes since morning

So this is my millionth quit attempt (figuratively), and I've decided that today i'll just focus on not smoking any cig until the end of day. I will think about tomorrow when I get there. my last partially successful quit attempt was 57 days long and on 56th I was certain that I would make it past a year, but as they say, old habits die hard, I went to a party where everyone was lighting up, and after a few drinks I couldn't resist the urge. no worries, learned from the past, looking towards the future. will get a badge reset and start again. wish me luck :)

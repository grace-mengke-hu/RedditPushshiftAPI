18 days nicotine free and wrote some things that have helped me so far:

Telling my family not to give me any cigarettes 
Not quitting drinking completely but staying away from smokers when I drink
Not worrying about weight and eating what I want
Deep breathing
Anxiety meds
Reminding myself not one puff ever
Green tea
Quitting coffee first couple weeks
Reviewing health achievements 
Knowing that the thought will get better and to let it pass
Starting to crochet a blanket

Going drinking

I'm going out with a friend. She smokes. I just sat with her for 3 cigarettes..  They smelled bad and I didn't want one. I just craved doing something with my hands. Smoking is the natural thing to do for me. im starting to wonder if I was ready to hang with a smoker yet. Only 18 days in....  Ugh!!!!!

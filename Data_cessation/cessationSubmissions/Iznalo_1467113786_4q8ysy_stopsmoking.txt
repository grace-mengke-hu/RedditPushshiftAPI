Feeling refreshed today at day 50

Maybe it's a fluke, but just woke up feeling siper refreshed ..... Lots of energy  .... I can't remember feeling this well rested! The last 50 days have felt good but I will admit I have been dragging a bit, going to bed early and still feeing a bit tired and dull.

Hoping this is the start to the next chapter!

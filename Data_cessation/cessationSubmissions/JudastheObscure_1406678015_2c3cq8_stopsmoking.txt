I had two puffs...

How did I ever find smoking enjoyable??? The good thing is, the romance is over and while I do feel stupid for even taking the two puffs, it physically repulsed me, like it should any non-smoker. 

It's like desperately wanting to get back together with an ex, getting what you want, then realizing what a piece of shit he/she was all along and how you're better off.

Also, are two puffs enough to warrant resetting the quit date?

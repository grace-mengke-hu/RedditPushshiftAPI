How do I learn to "want" to quit?

So I've been smoking on and off for about 5 years now?  And abstractly I feel like I should want to quit- smoking is terrible for me, expensive, etc.

My problem is that I don't feel like it's an addiction I need to shake- it doesn't feel like cigarettes are somehow crippling me or like I crave them and it's controlling my life. I feel like if I actually WANTED to quit it wouldn't be that hard.

But I enjoy cigarettes. I like the feeling of smoking. I like the way it gives me a break in my day. I enjoy having something I can use to reward myself if I do something I'm supposed to. It makes me feel cool (which I know is preposterous, but I still feel it). 

The reason I guess I feel like I should quit now is because I've noticed I'm getting up to almost half a pack a day, which seems very high. I'm worried that I'm going to get for real "addicted" soon and I won't be able to quit even if I want to. Which seems silly- I'm okay with smoking but only as long as I could quit if I wanted? But I know that I definitely don't like the idea of becoming really addicted- but for some reason that doesn't translate into me actually feeling like quitting is something I want for myself.

I realize this may seem like a strange post- I guess I'm just hoping that maybe someone here has some perspective or something that worked for them in a similar situation?

*I have tried e-cigs. I do not enjoy them- and yes, I tried the nice kind. They don't at all feel like smoking real cigarettes to me. And honestly after smoking those was one of the only times when I've actually felt like I had a chemical addiction to nicotine- the days when/after I've smoked e-cigs I've wanted real ones way more than I have at any other time.

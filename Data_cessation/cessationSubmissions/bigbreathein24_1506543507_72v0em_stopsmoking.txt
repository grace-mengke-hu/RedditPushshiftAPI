After all this time quit, I still have urges.

When I become very overwhelmed/depressed at things, I still find myself thinking (like a small, shitty whisper...), "Damn, I wish I still smoked. I would love one right about now."

I never follow through or anything, but it's still surprising and illuminating to me exactly how STRONG of a grip smoking has on your lives. Wondering if these thoughts will somehow last the rest of my life if they've lasted almost 3 years.

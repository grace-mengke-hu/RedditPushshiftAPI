42 days

I have been reading a lot of your stories and find them very inspirational, 1000 hours I have reached today, am still getting some cravings but am feeling stronger this quit, last time I quit for 4 months and stupidly smoked a cigarette, this time I have more information, a greater desire and a new grandchild to make sure I never take another puff.

Need tips and advice!

I’m currently smoking my last cigarette as I type this. I’ve tried to quit so many times before and always end up buying a pack, just because I know i can, the store is right across the street. I get so moody when I try to quit and it’s like I have zero willpower. How do I get over my cravings without breaking down and buying a pack? How can I keep pushing myself and power through? Especially when I’m in situations that I usually smoke in?

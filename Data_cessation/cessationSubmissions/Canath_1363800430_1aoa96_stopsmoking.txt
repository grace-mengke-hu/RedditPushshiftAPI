Here we go.... Day 1. Bring the pain.

I've been a pack a day smoker for about 2 and a half years now and today is going to be my second "real attempt" to quit.  I'm sick of what its doing to my body, wallet, mind, and relationships.  Its time for me to end this.  My only hesitation is the amount of stress I'm going to encounter since it is currently mid-semester.  So how am I going to do  this? 

Simply, I draw a no-smoking sign on the back of my left hand.  It usually lasts 3 or 4 days which is enough time for physical withdrawal to cease and its all willpower from that point onward.  I was able to stop for 3 weeks last time using this method and I'm hoping it helps me quit for good.

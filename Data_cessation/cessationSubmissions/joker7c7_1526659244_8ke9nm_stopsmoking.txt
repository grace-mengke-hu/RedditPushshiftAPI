Unexpected bebefit

So its about 4 days now. I tried meditaion and I had a great sleep last night. This morning out of nowhere I get a feeling a great anger towards my self that pushing me so hard to get things done. And suprisingly I was so efficient for 1 hour and solved a problem which has been haunting me for a month. I guess ny inner  reward system is so messed up before.
Now I'm feeling like crap again. But looking forward to another 'moment'. Its really magical.

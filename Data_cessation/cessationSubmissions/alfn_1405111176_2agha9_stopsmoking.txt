My smoking problem, need help!!!

Hi reddit. First of all I want to say that I have not touched a ciggaret in 40+ days!!!! I started when I was working at this ice cream wearhouse. The guys overthere used to smoke like chiminies. So I picked up on the act, one day I was so frustrated at god knows what and I decided to go buy a pack of ciggarets. Menthol ones. I smoked my first one, throat burned like hell. Smoked second one a few weeks later, same thing. Smoked my third one a month after that when I got frustrated a this second job I lost $100+ worth of tools and had to drive 60 miles for NOTHING. That was the last time I smoked a ciggaret which was a while ago. So in actuality I've only smoked about 8 ciggarets I know I didn't recall all of them because it was non-consistant. Have my lungs suffered a lot of damaged? I'm a little worried how can I heal them? Also at my job I'm exposed to people smoking. So I inhale the odor and whatnot and it makes my throat feel weird, like the feeling you get when you get super mad on your throat or whatever. Please help me reddit, I'm couting on you. What should I do? How will my lungs end up? How can I speed recovery? I haven't noticed any sideeffects yet.

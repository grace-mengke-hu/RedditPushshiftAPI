2 bongs left and I am officially a non smoker. I plan to use keystone habits like meditation exercise and other creative hobbies that I might be interested in.

I plan on swapping rooms about in my flat so it’s like a change of environment. Walk different routes. Just do different things in general. 

 tactics I will use when I have an urge to smoke;

 toothpicks.
Sipping water.
Gum.
Mindfulness of urge (how does it feel) (how  does my body react etc)

I have a lot of time and don’t have any routines apart from smoking and being degenerate.  

I plan on being about the subreddit daily so to be around like minded people striving towards the same goals and to hold myself accountable.

Tomorrow is my day!

I've had this day planned for about a month now, set for right after a few holiday stumbling blocks were over. I wanted to say my hellos here tonight; not sure if I'll post as much as observe, but either way I think I need this to help me stay quit.

I've been smoking about a pack a day (more if I'm drinking or ...) for fifteen years or so, and I've made a few attempts so far. I tried both Zyban (no effect on cravings) and Chantix (nausea, blunted affect). The patch helped several times for a few weeks, and I would suddenly become obsessed with smoking again and eventually wear down and light up. My first attempt to quit was ten years ago, cold turkey, lasted about eight easy months and then the same sudden and overwhelming fixation.

My plan this time is to switch to vaping. I bought the materials and tried it out, and I can really see it becoming a permanent replacement. I would like to work my way down on the nicotine level to none eventually, but I think having the behavioral substitute will be the key to long term success for me.

I'm really nervous about this after so many failed attempts, but this is the first time I actually feel ready. I've truly enjoyed cigarettes all these years, and never wanted to quit, just known that I need to eventually. Over the last week, I've gotten pretty sick of cigarettes and want to be done with them. That feeling, and how surprisingly satisfying my vape pen turns out to be, are making me feel very positive going into tomorrow.

Anyway, I'm glad to be here, excited to start a badge, and looking forward to being a non-(tobacco)smoker. If anyone who's quit by switching to e-cigs or vape has any tips or warnings, I'm all ears (eyes). Otherwise, thanks for reading!

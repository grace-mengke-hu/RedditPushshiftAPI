Guilt

I quit last January.  It was great.  I stopped craving cigarettes for the first time in almost 10 years.  I was so proud of myself and my (nonsmoking) SO was so happy.

Then...I was put in a situation where I was hanging out with tons of new people on an international trip and my social anxiety flared up.  I bought a pack of cigarettes telling myself I would only smoke on this trip..  When the trip ended, I did stop smoking again.  But it slowly crept back into my life.  Bumming a cigarette here and there when I'm drinking turned into buying a pack "just for this party" so I wouldn't have to be a bum.  

I'm still not in a full raging addiction mode again.  I can go a day or two without a cigarette but when evening comes the need for one feels overwhelming.  And when drinking or excessive stress is involved...forget about it.  I feel like I'm slowly becoming a slave to cigarettes again and letting myself and my SO down.  Every morning after I smoked the night before, all I feel is guilt and shame.

Ugh...ok...day one here we go.

9 days today!

So 9 days ago I decided to change my lifestyle completely. No more junk food, no smoking and a lot more exercise. Started off with the strongest nicotine patches and used them 6 days, but i've been fine without them now for 3 days, so I will try "holding on" without spending any more money on nicotine products! Also the change that happened after a week of not smoking amazed me. When I was smoking I couldn't run more than 200 meters before I had to take a break... And today (only after 9 days) I ran 5 kilometers and it felt awesome! So to anyone who is thinking about quitting, I say go for it!

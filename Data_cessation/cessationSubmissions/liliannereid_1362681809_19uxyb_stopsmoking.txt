On day 4!

I get violent mood swings, but I know that I love this, I love not smoking. I love not worrying about my chest pain gradually getting worse. I love being able to breathe! It feels like I'm taking control of my life and I can do anything! I've realized it's all just brainwashing. When I quit smoking before, what always got me again was the picture I had of myself in my mind - writing, painting, creating something, with a cigarette in my mouth. What I've now realized is that this idea, that I can't be an artist without smoking (sounds horribly stupid when I say it out loud) is just a part of the whole brain washing we are subject to. It simply isn't correct. I was conditioned to think so. But I'm breaking free from that now, becoming healthy. A little less a slave. I'm going to exercise every day! Been doing yoga, it just feels amazing tuning in with my body again, not ignoring it and damaging it drag by drag. Listening to it, giving it what it needs.

Sorry, a bit of a ramble there. But yes! Power to you all, you are the best, you can do anything you want to do! Love!

(Sorry about all the exclamation marks, mood swings)

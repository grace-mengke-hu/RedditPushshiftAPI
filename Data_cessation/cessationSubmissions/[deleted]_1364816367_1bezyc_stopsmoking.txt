What kind of things should i do to avoid smoking at office?

I generally don't have urges to smoke. I have been smoking for nearly 5 years now (I am 26). I haven't smoked more than 4 cigs a day. But i want to stop this completely. 


When i am at home i don't smoke. I don't go to buy that single cigarette. But when i am in office or around other friends who smoke, I can't help myself from taking that 5 min break from work and hangout. But when we hangout we smoke. I can't stop myself from not smoking that cigarette at that time. 

This is the biggest problem I am having right now. Do you guys have any advice on how to do this? 

I know I must muster up more will power but anything that can aid me in mustering it up?

EDIT: I like these friends of mine, and I don't wanna cut them out of my life at all.

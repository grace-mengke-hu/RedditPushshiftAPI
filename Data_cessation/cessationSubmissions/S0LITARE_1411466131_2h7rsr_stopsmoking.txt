Need a little help.

I've been trying to quit for about two months now, but even with anti-smoking aids I can only seem to get down to one or two smokes a day. I've tried patches, gum and mouth spray atm and I can push past the morning cravings fairly well most days, however the afternoon to evening cravings really bite in deep.

Any suggestions for getting over the next hurdle?

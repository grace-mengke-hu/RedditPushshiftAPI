3 months clean but still feeling like crap?

My heart rate is still resting around 100, I still don't feel like I can breathe great, I still dream about smoking. The only difference is I've ended up gaining 20 lbs! Not good! Depression worse than ever and no energy etc etc. I'm at a loss, I thought it'd be better by now but it isn't and I'd still love a cigarette. If anything I had more motivation as a smoker, now there's nothing I want so I'm feeling very down.

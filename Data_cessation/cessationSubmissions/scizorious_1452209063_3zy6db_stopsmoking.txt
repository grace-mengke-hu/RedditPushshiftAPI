5 months but fat

Made it to the 5 month mark and can't believe how well it has gone. Most days I don't think about tobacco and when I do the urges are easy to control.

The biggest problem (literally) is my weight gain. I have gone up 35 lbs since I quit because I am always snacking or drinking sugary drinks. My Dr. told me to make it to 6 months tobacco free before really worrying about my weight (he says not smoking does more good than gaining weight temporarily does bad). 

Anyone have any recommendations? I want to be a trim tobacco free person, instead of a fat one. Thanks for all the support and encouragement over these 5 months, I really appreciate it.

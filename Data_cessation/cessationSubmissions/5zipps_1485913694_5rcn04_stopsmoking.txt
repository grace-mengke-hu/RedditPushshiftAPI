Needing words of encouragement

Hi, I have decided to put down my cigarettes after 30 years of smoking. I say put down because I just don't like the word quit. It has been 5 days now with no cigarette. The cravings I thought would start to demenish but nope sometimes they are worse then the day before. I try and write myself positive notes on why I am doing this, it helps sometimes. Other times I find myself snapping at the ones I love only to take a deep breath and apologize. I have to do this, I have to get past these cravings, I have to change my ways,  I have to live a healthier life. I need to find a hobby, I need to get out an exercise more. I need a motivator. 
I found this site through an app I'm using to help me quit. I read some of the things some of u are going through. I'm glad I'm not alone. Congrats to all of you. Stay strong. Together we can beat this nasty ass addiction. 
One day at a time

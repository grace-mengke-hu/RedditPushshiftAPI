Was just wondering why this time is different?

Last year I tried to quit with Easyway and it worked. I pretty much stopped for a week or two. Then I got to socializing and drinking and pretty much bought single cigarettes and you can guess what happened there.

Now I just quit and aside from that first day of hell everything is much different. I don't have that many cravings if any at all. I've been completely fine. I did get drunk last night and didn't want or crave it at all. I did have one scary moment, I dreamt I bought a pack and smoked a single cigarette. Besides that I've been fine. What gives? Why is this time so different than all my other previous attempts?

My ultimate goal is to save money. If I keep using E-cigs, I'm afraid I will still have a nicotine addiction and never be able to quit. Has anyone had this issue?

I'm at 4 days without having a conventional cigarette but I have been using an ecigarette like crazy. All I can think about is how these will eventually run out and I'll go back to cigarettes.

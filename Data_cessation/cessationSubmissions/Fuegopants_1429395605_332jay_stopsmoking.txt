1 Month free today!

So I still have dreams/nightmares of smoking again every night and still have cravings every day. 

While they are nowhere near as bad as before my question is.. do they ever go away? I don't see myself lighting up any time soon, but that doesn't mean I'm enjoying myself.

I want to know when I should start expecting to not have these crazy mood swings or cravings. This is my first time quitting (after 0.75 packs/day for 6 years).

The resolve is there but the crazy moods (depression/joy/anger) are driving me nuts! I'm usually so level headed and it's starting to alienate my friends!

I will add though, it's all a first world problem compared to the first 2 weeks.

Thanks :)

Most obnoxious week for me so far this year, of course I should quit in the middle of it.

Hi guys, today marks the close of day 1 without smoking for me. I had my last several hours before bed last night. I've quit twice before, both times spur of the moment after cutting back.

What makes this time pretty unique is that I actually am not even craving it. This week I had jury duty, which was challenging because of my bizarre work hours. Today I had a few cavities filled, and as the novocaine is wearing off I'm in a lot of pain, but I can't take any pain relievers due to a prescription I have to take for an unrelated issue. I started the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred over the past week and have been doing it every day (almost), and I hate exercise with a passion. Next week we are moving to an apartment up many flights of stairs, and I've begun the arduous task of having to pack up several years' worth of clutter. None of that is enjoyable! I hate it all! 

I am amazed at how good I feel, despite all of this. It's all because I feel the burden lifted. I was really depressed about my immediate need to quit, with all of these things that I feel strongly irritated toward, but I am thinking now that it would be even worse if I was having to drop everything to have a death stick, knowing that it is actively giving me an irreversible and deadly disease early in life and knowing that my money problems would be nearly completely gone without my pack-a-day habit, and knowing that I will be forever winded and feeling like I'm having a heart attack each time I have to climb all those stairs to get to the new place.

It feels really good to talk about it. I'm grateful for this subreddit! Thanks to anyone who has read this.

My thoughts help me to not give in, but they make me depressive. Please correct them for me if I’m wrong

There are non-smokers, smokers, and ex-smokers on earth. I was a non-smoker till 17 years of age, then was a smoker for the following 15 years, and now I'm an ex-smoker on my 3rd day. 

People speak about ex-smokers as if they are similar/comparable to non-smokers, which isn't true, in my opinion. I don't know how I will feel myself in future (when getting a real ex-smoker), but now on my 3rd day, I feel as ”a smoker that didn't smoke for 2,5 days”. And have the feeling that I will feel in 3 years as a ”smoker that didn't smoke for 3 years”.  

Cause I crave cigarettes so bad. Just as a smoker does. And exactly this thought helps me not to give in. I tell myself ”you’ll crave cigarettes whether you smoke one right now, or not”.  So smoking one more cigarette will only make me ’not crave for 10-20 min.’ and after that, the cravings will start again. ”Do you want to lighten a cigarette to just stop craving for 20 min?” No, it's not worth the money and health issues. And it won’t help! So here comes the negative aspects of this thought which make me depressive. Whatever I do, this craving won’t go away. I feel like I will crave all my life. I’ll never be an ex-smoker. I’ll be only a smoker that didn't smoke for X years. 

I should have listened to my father 15 years ago, as he told me not to smoke that first cigarette. I want to cry. I’m addicted no matter what I do or not do. 

So what speaks against lightning a cigarette every now and then? It won't hurt my bank account nor my health? I can't find a logical argument against this.. smoking 1-2 cigarettes every week, should be okay?

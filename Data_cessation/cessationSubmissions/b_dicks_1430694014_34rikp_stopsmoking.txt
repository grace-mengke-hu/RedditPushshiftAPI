How to support someone quitting nicotine?

Hello everyone, I am seeking advice on how to be support for someone that is quitting nicotine.

My boyfriend uses nicotine lozenges and is currently in the process of cutting the nicotine content from 2mg to 1mg. Needless to say, he hasn't exactly been a bundle of joy the past few days.

My question is is how do I go about being supportive to him and encourage/make him feel empowered without breaking out the "I know how you feel" and sad attempts at offering advice?

I feel like anything I offer is, well, unsolicited as I have never personally struggled with any addiction of any kind. I have also never been around someone or been involved intimately with someone dealing with/ending an addiction.

Is there anything I can be doing to help him with his mood/cravings? I find myself taking his mood very personally on occasion even though I know it's just the agitation from lack of nicotine. I'm just trying to find out if I can be of any real help instead of just lackluster attempts at compliments and advice that don't do any real good for him.

Any advice is welcome, thanks in advance!!

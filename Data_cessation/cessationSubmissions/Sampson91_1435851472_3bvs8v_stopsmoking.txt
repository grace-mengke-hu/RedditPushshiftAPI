Approaching 1 Week

So, 5 and a half days smoke - free, thought id share my (Very limited) experience: Still having to really fight myself to not fall off the wagon, think I've chewed my way through my own body weight in gum but haven't given in to the bloody evil death sticks! And yes, I am quite pleased with myself haha! Hope everyone is getting on okay, day 3 was hell for me but it has got slightly easier since then.
 
is it normal to still crave cigarettes even though I now find the smell of someone else's smoke disgusting?

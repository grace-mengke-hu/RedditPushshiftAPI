What to expect the first 24 hours.

**HOUR ~24**

Up to now I've experienced:

Physically:

- intervals of 5 to 10 minutes of face numbness, hand shaking and some random things.
- 0 focus or concentration.
- slight headache
- 4 to 6, 5 to 10 minutes hyper cravings... 
- 6 to 10, small little cravings.


Mentally

- "SMOKEEEEEE!" - 25 Times per second
- "Maybe you could smoke that butt on the floor." 
- "you know what we used to do while ___Insert activity____, smoke a fine suave cigarrette. Let's have one"

So yeah basically my body is ill and my brain is an asshole.



**EDIT: HOUR ~40**

Physically

- It's been hard to sleep. Some insomnia.
- Having a huge craving right now. 
- Something is missing - but it's mising less than yesterday? Maybe?
- HUNGER ATTACK!!!!

Mentally

- I've been able to keep shutting the voices in my brain. These have worked:

-- Ok, so you have suffered a lot since monday. Want to do this all over again next week or shall we quit now?

-- Look at all those stupid smokers with their... delicious... no.. filthy cigars.

-- You will not die a painful death! Bare with me.

-- Hey look, my money is lasting longer in my wallet! Maybe I could buy a new watch with the money I'm saving this year!


- I've been having thoughts that are weird... am I getting sad?

-- You've always smoked... cigarrettes define you... what are you without cigars? 

-- There would be something missing forever...

-- What you're feeling will last for ever!

-- You're weak... you'll be smoking in 10 days...


However, these self-attacks are cancelled saying "SHUT UP BRAIN. [YES I CAN!](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/4714511/yes-i-can-o.gif)" 



**EDIT: HOUR 48**


Ok, we're still strong. The nicotine craves are hard and almost 1 per hour? Brain is still stupid and bargaining his way out of this.

I found a great video - [Quit smoking!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyIJo7VCdPE)

I'm preparing myself mentally for the weekend, when most likely I'll be having some drinks. I cannot fail this time because in my experience, it takes a lot of time... like literally a lot... to build up courage again to try to stop smoking. I found a post of 2009 that stated that I was trying to quit smoking... it took me 4 years just to try again. 

What's working? 
- Gum
- Lolipops

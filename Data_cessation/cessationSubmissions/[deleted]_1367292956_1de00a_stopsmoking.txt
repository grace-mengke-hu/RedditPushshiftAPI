It starts now

I picked up smoking when I was 17 and a senior in high school, I've pretty much smoked all through college and after the past 2 days I'm done. I've gotten bronchitis this year and other aspects of my life are suffering due to smoking. i can't breath when I work out and I'm tired of having a dry nose along with the occasional sore throat, not to mention this shit is expensive. So to all other (not ex smokers but) anti-smokers let's fucking do this and stop being weak about shit

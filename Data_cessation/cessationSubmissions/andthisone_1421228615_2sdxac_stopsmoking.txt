A rough night and a fresh start!

Last night I had a few too many to drink. I ran out of cigarettes, and I knew I wasn't fit to drive for more. So, in my inebriated and nicotine-addicted mind, I decided to search outside for a cigarette I had tossed away earlier in the day.

There was probably half a cigarette left! It was calling my name, so I go to my back porch in search. As I'm surveying the garden and yard, I leaned a bit too far and fell off the porch.

I landed on the cactus and I got quills in my butt. Fuck smoking! I may not have drank as much either if I wasn't trying to satiate my need to smoke.

I'm 3/4's of the way through allen carr's audio book. If anyone's wondering, you can find it for free on grooveshark.com

I'm doing it for real this time. No vaping. No gum. No bullshit. Stay strong everyone, giving up smoking isn't giving up anything at all, and it could very well be the best decision of your life.

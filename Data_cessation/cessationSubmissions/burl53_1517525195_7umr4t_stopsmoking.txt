Bad friends

Have any smokers/ex smokers experienced being shamed by friends and family in hopes that it’ll convince you to quit?

I had a friend come up to me the other day and say “So what’s it like standing out in the cold for 10 minutes just to come inside coughing and smelling like shit”. It was just a joke but I’ve had a lot of jokes at the expense of my addiction and it’s starting to get on my nerves. Every time I’m about to step outside I get some kind of comment about “cancer sticks”. I half don’t want to tell them that I’m quitting because the jokes will come back with a vengeance if I start up again.

Help me.

I have every reason to quit. 

I have a list so long that makes sense in every way that I should quit.

But I haven't.

I want to, I just don't know how.

I've tried and failed so many times that I wonder if I actually tried in the first place. Maybe my attempts were thwarted because maybe somewhere deep inside I really didn't want to... but I do want to quit. 

As a smoker I've always hated the way cigarettes smelled. I hated how everyone could smell them. I am ashamed to be a smoker. I hide it as best as I can from everyone, yet I somehow keep doing it. I promise myself and I promise those close to me that I will. My own uncle who succumbed to lung cancer told me to quit... yet I still do.

I make excuses.

Please help me. I know its obvious what I have to do, but I just can't seem to find the starting point that I really want. 

I see all these posts on 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 5 years, etc. of you guys all being smoke free. 

I too, want to be smoke free.

A YEAR!! I finally f*&^%ing did it!

Guys. Last Thursday I had a year. I started smoking at 13. Quit finally and for good at 32 years old. I used the patch and the gum at  the same time to wean myself off nicotine. 

I know this board has a cold-turkey bent but I tried 1000 times cold turkey and I just couldn't do it. I used NRT for three months as directed.  It worked awesome for me to create space between myself and the last smoke! The space and time gave me perspective.  Do whatever it takes and don't let anyone give you shit for escaping this demon!!

Hang in there. It took me 8 (yeah, EIGHT) full months of actively "not smoking" before the cravings finally left me. Day by day you can get there too. Don't give up before the miracle happens! Today I don't think about smoking - and if I do, my thoughts are this: Thank God I escaped with my life!!

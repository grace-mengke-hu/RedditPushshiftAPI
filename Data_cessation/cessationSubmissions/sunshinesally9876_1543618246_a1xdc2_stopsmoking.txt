Dreading the first Christmas party!

Day 13

Tonight is the first social event outside of my home since I quit smoking and I am very worried! In the past two weeks I have been able to handle the social gatherings because they were in my home with non smokers. Tonight the first of the Christmas parties, with smokers and alcohol and to top it off my judgemental in-laws. I have started the day with a sense of dread and have been contemplating how to be a social smoker and if I can survive this month without a smoke :(

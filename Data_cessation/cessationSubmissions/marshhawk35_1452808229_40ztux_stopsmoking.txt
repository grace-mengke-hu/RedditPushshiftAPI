How on earth was I a smoker?

I've been sick over and over since I quit - colds, bronchitis, now pneumonia - and I've never paid such close attention to my lungs before. Breathing is the kind of thing you ignore until you can't do it easily, I guess. I cannot believe I was a smoker. I'm kicking myself because if my lungs weren't so beat to hell from smoking, I'd probably not be as sick as I have been the past month.

I had such a rough time weeks 3 and 4, and then it was like I crossed a bridge and the cravings are getting fewer and less intense. Hang in there, everyone, if you're having a hard time right now. I'm sure there will be hurdles ahead for me, but I am in an infinitely better place than I was a week ago.

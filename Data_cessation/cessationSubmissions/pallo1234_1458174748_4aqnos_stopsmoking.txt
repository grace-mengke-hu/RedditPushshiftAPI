How did you move from ambivalence to commitment?

I really dislike (am disgusted by) a lot of things about smoking, but I'm not there yet. I've quit in the past - twice for longish periods (18 months and 6 months). Both times, I really had to gear up for it, motivationally. Read Carr, did all kinds of stuff to psych up for it. Used the patch + gum, which worked well at the physical side (that force is strong in this one). 

I just don't feel that same kind of fire right now. I guess I'm in the precontemplation stage, or whatever. But at the same time, I really feel it's time to quit. It's just time.

It's weird because while my head isn't into quitting, my *body* appears to be? I'm finding myself delaying smoking naturally and unconsciously. I'm not enjoying cigarettes, the taste is sickening. I hate the stink on my hair. I'll find myself holding a cigarette for ages and just not lighting it. Or I'll absentmindedly put the pack far away - not even consciously. But at some point the urge gets overwhelming, and I light the smoke (or get the pack).  


But psychologically, I feel like I still need it, somehow. And of course I'm addicted, physically. I almost feel like I could just not smoke - stop smoking - right now if I wanted to. But I'm not sure I don't want to? 

So what helped you when you were in that kind of place? Any books or tools or resources you'd recommend. Or, a method that worked for you when you were doing this sort of thing (leaning towards quitting without wanting to/wanting to).

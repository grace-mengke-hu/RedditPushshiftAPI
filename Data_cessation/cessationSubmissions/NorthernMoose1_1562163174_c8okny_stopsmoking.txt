Coming up on 3 months soon... Looking for longer time quitters experience &amp; support.

So I have lots of positives, but I really held this 3 month milestone to be when this whole â€˜thingâ€™ would be over... and I guess my brain is still adjusting and getting back to normal after I assaulted it with nicotine for a decade. Yikes.

Iâ€™m feeling very blah, bored, depressed still which I have read is normal due to the antidepressant nature of cigarettes (dopamine system being affected by MAOs or something of the like). Also I still get a few days of the month where I am still very irritable, which I have never been in my life before quitting. Thankfully that is happening a lot less, but I still am finding myself a lot more mouthy at times than I wouldâ€™ve ever dared to be in the past. ðŸ™ˆðŸ™Š

But like I said, lots of good things tooâ€” Iâ€™m so glad I quit... if youâ€™re new to quitting or thinking of quitting donâ€™t let this post scare you... Iâ€™m just not to the point where this is all behind me and Iâ€™m feeling back to myself yet. I basically have 2 lingering symptoms out of a load that I had initially. (Well maybe 3 or 4. Bleeding gums and some weird vivid dreams still sometimes about smoking ha!)

So basically I guess Iâ€™d like to hear from others further ahead than me to tell me that my dopamine brain or whatever will reboot and make me feel better again. Or that you felt this way too and itâ€™s normal and it gets better etc... How long til you shook off the lingering blahs and depression? Cause it sucks and itâ€™s getting old. 

So since iâ€™m near to hit my first milestone I had set and it didnâ€™t turn out to be the golden egg I thought it would be, what now? Is there another common timeframe when people say the cloud lifts at 4, 5, 6, or 9 months that frees you from this crap?


TL;DR: itâ€™s been almost 3 months. Still dealing with lingering quitting depression and blahhhhs with some irritability sprinkled in for fun.  When did it get better for you?

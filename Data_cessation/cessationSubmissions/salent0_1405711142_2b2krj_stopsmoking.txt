I just had a satisfying poop!!

I'm sorry if this is kind of gross but I'm so excited.

Today is Day 5 of no cigarettes (I've never bothered to get a badge because I've never lasted this long, maybe I'll get one!). I've smoked since I was 15 (21 now), ranging from few a day to over a pack a day. I was selling my prescriptions just to afford my next pack. No longer!

The times I have tried to quit cigarettes, pooping was the worst. It was like trying to pass peanut brittle through my rectum for fifteen minutes, the result being disappointing rabbit-shit-esque pebbles. Not today! It slipped out like Moses into the Nile, as if my poop had descended from heaven itself into the toilet.

I guess I have to thank the e-cig I've been using (low nicotine level, it has seriously made all the difference though). But something tells me it's smooth shitting from here on out, even when I ditch the nicotine altogether.

Also I don't smell bad anymore. And the smell of cigarettes is starting to seriously churn my stomach. And now I can save a little bit of money.

Why did I smoke again??

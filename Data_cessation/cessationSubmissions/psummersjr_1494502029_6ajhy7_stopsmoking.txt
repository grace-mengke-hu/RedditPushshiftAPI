Quitting this weekend

My wife and I are having our first child in October and that is my motivation for finally kicking this habit. I have reduced what I'm smoking over the last week and a half. In the past I have smoked 1-1.5 packs per day. I have gotten down to half a pack but getting below that seems tough. I have set my last day smoking to this Sunday. Any advise?

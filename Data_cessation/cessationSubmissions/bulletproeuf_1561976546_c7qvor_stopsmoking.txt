Please convince me to stop smoking, as I can’t do it myself

It’s my first time trying to quit, and I’m having a lot of trouble. I make so many excuses to the point where I don’t know whether the devil on my shoulder is telling me to continue or to quit. As someone who appreciates the social aspect of smoking far more than anything else, it’s so hard to see people going for a smoke and not being able to join them. I keep thinking, “I’m young, I’ve only been smoking for under a year, and I’ve got plenty of time to quit.” So far I’ve not caved in and am three days smoke-free, but I need some help, guys.

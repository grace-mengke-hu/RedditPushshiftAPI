4 months done and I nearly threw it all away

A self post more than anything.

I quit smoking 4 months ago and I'm sure people will hate me saying I've found it rather easy. I think I don't have an addictive personality and I always felt I wanted a cigarette rather than needed one.

So 4 months in and it's been relatively easy. Socialising with smokers and drinking being the hardest times to resist. I've been keeping mostly to myself and staying away from drinking just as a health choice. I'm now travelling with a smoker friend and the challenges are tough. She needs her smoke breaks which are (very lightly) ruining my holiday and socialising at hostels is an ex smokers nightmare. 

Is there anyone who doesn't smoke anymore?

I don't mind drinking and socialising but that's when I get vulnerable, especially with my favourite choice of American Spirits within arm reach. Normally this would be breaking point, and it was. I took one. I asked me friend for a smoke and stuck it behind me ear. I didn't light it immediately and I'm not sure why. In fact I never did light it. At the end of the night I handed it to my friend and she smoked it. 

Being drunk and surrounded by smokers is the toughest and I made it through somehow even though I was so so close to just lighting up. 

I hate that non smokers have become a minority (at least in my experience). I'm the odd one out for quitting that shit, where's my fucking medal?

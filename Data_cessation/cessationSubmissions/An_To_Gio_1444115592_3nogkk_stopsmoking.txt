Misery-sprinkled relief

Last night I dreamt of lighting up a cig and taking one puff before putting it out.
I don't even remember if I dream-inhaled it or not.
When I woke up I thought that I would have to reset my badge and I felt like crap before realizing that it hadn't actually happened.
I felt so relieved, you can't imagine how good it felt to be able to say "You idiot, you didn't cave!"

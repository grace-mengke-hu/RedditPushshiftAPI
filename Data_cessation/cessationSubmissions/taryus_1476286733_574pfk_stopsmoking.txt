Sitting outside with smokers

168 hours smoke free. Even so, seeing all these others smoking so casually almost makes me want to light one. After all, it's just one right? For old time's sake, my mind says. Once a week doesn't seem so bad. 

But it cannot happen. I am the fish and the cigarette is the tasty bait on the hook, except it's not even tasty. It's disgusting.

Welp, that went to hell pretty quick. Smoked two, 40 and 43 hours after "quitting"

Today, the second day, the physical cravings were honestly negligible until around lunch. When I got home my roommate's pack was sitting on the table and of course my addicted brain said to smoke "just one." I repeated my mantra while doing housework for a couple hours, then finally it got the better of me and I took one. 

The most ridiculous fucking thing is how I smoked it. I broke most of it off so that there were only like three puffs to be had. Smoked that. THEN, I retrieved the broken-off piece from the GARBAGE CAN and put it into the butt and smoked it too! Then had one after dinner too. All while fully conscious of the FACT that this was only creating more problems than it solved. 

It wasn't even satisfying. It felt bad. I felt like something else was in control of my body. I feel so stupid and weak willed.

I'm pissed off and feeling demoralized. Daddy Carr would say that this means I'm not ready to quit. So when *will* I be ready? Never, I think. What do I do now? Start a new quit? God damn it, now I have to go through day 1 again. This shit is so stupid

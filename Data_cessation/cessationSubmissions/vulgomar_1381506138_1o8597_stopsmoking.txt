Almost to 4 weeks, don't feel like I can make it.

Monday will be 4 weeks for me, but I have a huge project due on Tuesday and I haven't been able to work on it at all since I quit. I'm a writer and have always smoked while writing. I feel paralyzed. The last 3 weeks have honestly not been that bad, but all I can think of today is going and buying smokes so I can get this work done. It feels like trying to write without my left hand.

I'd love to hear from any other creative types about how you handled the transition to non-smoker. I'm going to do my best not to buy smokes for the next couple of hours. Don't know how much longer I can make it.

EDIT: I'm still here. I made it. Haven't written much, but something has clicked inside me. I realized in the past 25 days I would have spent around 80 hours smoking cigarettes. That is insane. How did I ever have time to write in the first place?

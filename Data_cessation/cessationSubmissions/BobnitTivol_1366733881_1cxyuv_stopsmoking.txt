6 Days, 19h, 55m. Still finding it very hard.

Stress at work is not helping. Being stuck in an office is no fun. I feel like I need to move, but have another 4 or 5 hrs until I get off. Nearly went to buy some "coffee", but talked myself out of that for now. Sorry for the stream on consciousness stuff but it does help to vent.

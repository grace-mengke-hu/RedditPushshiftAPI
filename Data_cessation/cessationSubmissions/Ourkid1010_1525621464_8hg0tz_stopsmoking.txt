Does NRT reset my quit attempt?

I'm into week 2 and REALLY struggling with a huge crave. It's been building the last couple days and today it's almost unbearable.

I just can't stop thinking about just going, getting a pack, smoking 1 and then restarting the stop.

Now logically I know this is BS and just my mind telling me to give in, and the cycle begins again.

However, right now I just can't cope. Does having a nicotine mint reset my quit counter? Would this make me more likely to start smoking again as I'm putting more nicotine back into my body?

Dreaming about smoking?

I’m 10 days smoke free and I’m not looking back!
However....
I keep dreaming about smoking. Just before I woke up this morning I was having a dream about having coffee and a cigarette on my patio in the predawn hours, which used to be one of my favorite past times. 
I woke up feeling like I’d cheated somehow. I felt so guilty. 
Its been almost every night. 
Anyone else? Thoughts?

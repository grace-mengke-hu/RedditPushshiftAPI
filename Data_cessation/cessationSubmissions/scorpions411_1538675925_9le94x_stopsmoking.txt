Struggling with a lot of pimples on my forehead

I am almost at day 50. Have been smoking professionally for over 10 years. Dont know what to do with my skin. Particulary the forehead.  Its getting worse and worse. Granted, my diet ist really shitty. But that was also the case before i quit. Anyone having similar issues ?

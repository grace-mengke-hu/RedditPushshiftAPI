27 hours without smoking

I don't write this to brag about it, I'm just happy, That's the first time I managed that much (previous record was like four hours during a train trip), I think I can aim for 48. As u/dilo66 told me, the hardest part is making the decision to quit, and I think they were right. So far it seems nowhere near as impossible as people say it is. So just start

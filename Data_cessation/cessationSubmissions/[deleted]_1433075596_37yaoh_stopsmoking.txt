"Sometimes you just have to believe in what you can't see" Cab driver, Fringe, S3E1

This atheist believes a little faith is needed to quit an addiction like smoking. The trap of the addiction is the idea that the gravity of smoking will always act as a force on me and that I will have to perpetually work to stay free. I know from past successes this is false, that I can break free of gravity. When I slipped back into smoking, I lost that feeling of freedom, even forgot what it felt like. I have to work my way out again. I am sustained by a little faith, by believing in something I don't see or feel right now, that I can be free again, free and stay that way, effortlessly. It's hard to believe when trapped in the addiction -- that's why it's an addiction. But I have more than belief. I have a little faith too.

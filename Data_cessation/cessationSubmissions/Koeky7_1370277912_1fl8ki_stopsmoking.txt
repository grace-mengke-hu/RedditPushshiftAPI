An alternative for smoking(breaks)?

Hello fine people,

I already haven't smoked cigarettes in 1,5 months (hooray!). And the only thing I really miss are the lack of smoking breaks and the lack of a product in my jacket. 

I don't really miss smoking. I miss my pal who was there always for me. Who was in my pocket. Always ready!

Do you guys have an advice on a product that could give me the same feeling? (Normal chewing gums doesn't help). 

Thanks!

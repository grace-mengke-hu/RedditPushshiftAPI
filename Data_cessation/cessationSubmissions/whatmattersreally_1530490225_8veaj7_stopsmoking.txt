so tired of smoking

i’m sitting here on a park bench, just bought a pack, smoked 2 and then threw it out. i’ve done stretches recently of not smoking for roughly a week at a time.


i’m so done with this shit. it makes me feel awful, and it puts me in a bad headspace after where i start to question what i’m doing with my life, feeling like all the progress i’ve made just goes out the window.


i want to just take a break from the world for a while. not be out around people. just work, gym, errands and home. i wish i had a support group or something. i feel like i need to surround myself with people who are like minded and enjoy doing more “boring” adult stuff (if that makes any sense). finding that is a bit of a catch-22 because i usually end up smoking to deal with some mild social anxiety that comes when meeting new people.


i’m not sure what the point of this post is, but i feel like i have to do something other than what i’ve been trying to do lately, so i figured i’d start here. going to update my flair after this post and give it another go. any advice or encouragement would be appreciated.

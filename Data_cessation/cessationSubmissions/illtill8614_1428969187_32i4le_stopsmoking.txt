How to Handle a Devastating Life Experience and Stay Committed to Quitting

Long story short:

smoked a pack a day 4 10 years, started at 18

sporadic periods of non-smoking, never more than a few weeks at the time, with the assistance of patches most of the time --- never seemed to work, i hated those fucking things

so back in November, my aunt, who has been a heavy smoker for almost 20 years, recommended an e-cig to me. told me it helped her quit smoking, so i went for it. Yeah, i know, it's not technically quitting. but it worked for me, say what you will about e-cigs and adverse health effects blah blah blah that shit worked for me.  I used it for about 1 month until the cravings went away, and boom: smoke free for 4 months. put the e cig down and didn't even think about newports anymore

Until, Friday.

Dude, fucked up shit. a friend of mine passed away under shocking and tragic circumstances. so, the day the news broke, me and many friends had many many drinks, to understate. And i cracked.

Since Friday I bought one pack and hit the loosie store more than a few times. I am charging the e-cig as we speak, and have confidence that it can get me back to being smoke free, because the last four months without cigs were fucking so much better than the last 10 years with them, and i want back on the band wagon.

guess what i'm saying is, i don't need any help to get back started. but, how do you all keep it together when some really terrible shit goes down in your life and keep from picking up the cigs again? just curious what you all had to say.

PS - not a drinking issue, because after that first month, I could get hammered if i wanted to with all my friends at the bar and not even want a cigarette. this is purely mental

14 years of smoking - how to start stopping?

I'm lost. I want to stop. It seems impossible and I want to prove **myself** I can be stronger than that!!

Is there any support group where I can vent? How do you cope with feeling like shit? 

Now I cut down to pack a day (20) from three packs a day (yes... 60). 

Female, turning 29 and turning 15 years of addiction in fall. I want to celebrate my birthday in December with being bullshit free!

Books, audio books, videos, music, blogs, forums, messages to listen while sleeping - anything recommended I'm willing to try out.

I feel lost (as I said in first sentence) and need guidance and support. I feel alone. Scared of failure. 

Can someone please direct me how to start "right" so that I reduce my chances of going back as much as possible. 

My plan is going cold turkey since I suck at cutting back to zero (tried, manage to get to 10, failed, felt like shit).

Is there hope?

5 Days Already

So, it´s been five days since my last cigarette.

Got some pretty intense cravings even though I use a Vape, but they subside after half an hour or a little more.

I can take more deep breaths now than due the last few years and I don´t feel as down anymore, which is probably related to oxygen-levels in the blood. Smells also do increase by now.

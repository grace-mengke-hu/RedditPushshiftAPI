Any ex-vapers out there?

I understand there's a vaping forum but feel this place is better as there will be a lot of pro-vapers on the other forum.

Has anyone here gone from smoking heavily to vaping to quitting it all? Any experiences going from vaping to zero?

20-30 a day smoker for nearly 20 years. vaping 5ml of 6mg a day for 22 days. even for such a low dose of nicotine, taking that final step feels difficult.

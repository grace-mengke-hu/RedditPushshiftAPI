I don't even know where to start. Where did you?

I have been smoking consistently since I was 16 and on a pack a day for almost 10 years now, the parents smoked too. I know that for the first time I can say that I have the desire to quit.  

I have anxiety about quitting.  I am 3 years sober from alcohol, a lot went into that.  My sobriety leans on cigarettes socially.  American Spirits are part of my breaks, phone calls, driving, and cups of coffee every single day.  

I want to quit smoking right now, then I don't make it an hour.  Cigarettes feel anxiously hardwired into my day.  I am fit active and healthy in every aspect of my life but this one.  

Could you guys offer insights into what beginning this process was like for you? What caused the turning point? How'd it feel?

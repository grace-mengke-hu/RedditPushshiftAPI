Today's my 7th day :)

I've been sick for a week - probably due to splitting two packs with two friends over the course of one drinking night last week - but since then I've been clean! Last week's Saturday night was my last cigarette. 

My roommates are gone and I haven't been out drinking since, so I haven't really been put to the test. I've also been smoking a bunch of weed (stupid while being sick, I know), but I'm almost done my batch and planning not to reup for a while - probably until the summer. 

Advice on not slipping once I'm back out drinking/with friends/roommates who smoke? I don't want to blow my headstart. I think I lasted 10 days in the beginning of the year before caving.

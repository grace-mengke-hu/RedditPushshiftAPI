This is a very difficult challenge...

I quit cold turkey...165 days...so many days I have felt like buying a pack...which I did twice in my 165 days...the first time was around day 30...I got home, opened up the pack...thought about it and placed the opened pack under the sink...the next time I bought a pack was around day 90...which I actually did smoke a cigarette...but I placed the rest of the pack under the sink as well...I never reset at day 90 because I did not consider that a relapse...just a glitch...From that day It has been a struggle at times, some days are easy, others I just feel like a cigarette...it is the stress that makes me want to smoke...I still cannot believe I made it to day 165... I still feel like smoking most of the time...but I am also enjoying my smoke free life! Working out, smelling good, feeling  good. Day by day...I can do it!

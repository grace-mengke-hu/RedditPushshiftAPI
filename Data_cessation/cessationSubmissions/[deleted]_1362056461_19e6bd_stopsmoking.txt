Need advice 

I just found this  subreddit and saw all the success stories and its inspiring to see all the support so I came here to find out how you guys did it. First off I'm 20 years old and have been smoking for 2 years. My family hates it, my girlfriend hates it, and I hate it. I've tried quitting plenty of times. I also have ADHD and the medication they put me on doubles my craving for a smoke. I can't quit cold turkey theirs just too much anxiety and I'm not strong enough. One way I almost quit was quitting my ADHD meds for a week for spring break but when I took again I had panic attacks and had to smoke. It's very disappointing to me that I can't snap this habit. I would appreciate your advice

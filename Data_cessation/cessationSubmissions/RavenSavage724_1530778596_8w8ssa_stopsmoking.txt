Having Trouble Staying Motivated...

This is now my fourth time attempting to quit smoking in the last three months. I've been smoking for six years and I'm trying to quit for my health--and because it's an expensive habit.

Yet...recently I've hit a lot of obstacles as well as my father passing, so I've ending up caving in and smoking. For now it's been only 4 hours smoke free but at this point I wonder if I can honestly even commit to quitting.

Any advice?

F*CKED UP &gt;&lt;

Quite intentional to be honest. Went a good 3.5 months with no smokes. Recovered well. Managed cravings well. SmokeFree App helped - A LOT! 

Everything was just perfect. Come NYE, I was home alone and just wanted to disconnect from everyone and chill. My mind "literally" went, "you owe yourself a treat as you've lasted this long" The fucking treat ended up being 2 fucking packets! I'm back on now, casually smoking.

The good thing is that this experience has made me realise that I've been resilient and have fought through all the physical and organic withdrawal symptoms. 

I've got my cousin's engagement to attend to in a few weeks - figured that I'm gonna continue to smoke casually until end of Jan and then give up and restart all over again.

I feel perplexed.

Fuck! Need to reset my badge :(

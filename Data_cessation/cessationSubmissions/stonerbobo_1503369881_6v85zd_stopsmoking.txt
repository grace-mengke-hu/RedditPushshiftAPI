Day 31! High appetite &amp; sugar cravings.

1 month in and my appetite has shot up dramatically over 1-2 weeks. I was unknowingly suppressing my appetite and was basically undernourished/underfed all the time without realizing it. Nicotine gave me a quick boost of energy whenever I needed it.

Now I crave sugar on bad days, but it is only when I don't eat well enough. On days where I eat a solid breakfast and consciously eat well, before getting to the starvation point it doesn't happen. Best days I am snacking often and eating 4-5 small meals a day (all healthy, no junk food), and it turns out I'm hitting the right calorie goals naturally! I am seeing diets with lots of protein and less carbs work better to fuel me through the day.

I guess i'm saying its *really* cool to have a more direct connection with what my body needs and see the results - it has been the best part of quitting so far. Could not even imagine any of this happening while i was still smoking.

Pay attention to your appetite and stay well-fueled!

Thank you for the last few days

Hello!
This is my first time reading reddit message boards/forums/on reddit. Someone suggested this subreddit as a resource to help support my quit and I've been reading some threads over the past few days. The messages posted here really helped me stay on track, confident about my decision and positive I can succeed. I felt compelled to write a short thank you to the members of this community for helping support and inspire my successful quit. 
I have been smoking heavily for 7 years, multiple quit attempts that lasted various amounts of time the longest of which was 26 days. This time I'm confident in the decision, thinking of myself as a nonsmoker and already feeling many pleasant benefits from quitting smoking; I can breathe easier, hiking small trails is easier, I can smell better and I smell better, my tongue feels better and flavours are enhanced, I have more energy, skins looking slightly better already. I have been having a lot of difficulty sleeping, staying active helps a little but still haven't slept much. 
Cigarettes were my greatest companion at times, both study buddy and procrastination tool, most likely way to get breaks at work (short ones, service industry) social prop, social tool/way to meet people/family gatherings/party break/ driving habit, constant habit. Just a bad habit. 
I'm doing good with not wanting smokes but am eating a lot and I would say I have a strong oral fixation. Any advice for overcoming the oral fixation part of the habit? I am constantly sucking on Twizlers or vitamin c or my fingers :$
Thanks again reddit!

three things that have helped me massively cut down and quit

Hi all. A week fully smokefree after cutting down over a long period. Here are some tips that have helped me cut down from a pack every few days to 2 cigarettes per day, to 1 to now hopefully going without.

**1:** I kept an airtight jar where I would flick all my ash and cigarette butts. As I was cutting down I would force myself to open the jar and take a good whiff before a smoke, or whenever I had a crave. As you can imagine it smells absolutely foul. Oftentimes that whiff was enough to put me off the cigarette, or forget the crave I had at the time. Nowadays I keep the jar on my shelf and I see it everyday. I don't need to open it anymore, just the memory of the smell is enough to make me no longer desire a cigarette. Credit for this idea goes to a random askreddit user.

**2:** I used [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM) that was posted on here a few months back. It's a hypnosis thing and I went in completely skeptical and left feeling pretty good about the experience. I think it helped that I was already in a headspace that wanted to quit. Before I was thoroughly unconvinced but it helped me solidify some of the things I was already feeling so I think it definitely worked.

**3:** I quit/cut down with a friend. I think this really helped because we could encourage eachother and vent about how we feel to somebody who understood as they were going through the exact same experience. I think it helped double down on the negative feelings of having a relapse because I would have to convey that failure to the person I was quitting with. All around, massively useful to quit with somebody. 

Congrats if you got to the bottom. I'm going back to exam revision now. If anyone has any little tricks that worked for them feel free to add in the comments. Peace.

Day 19 With The Help Of Smoke Free

I have had several attempts . Smoke Free app brilliant if you follow their advice.
I cut down gradually with niquitin pre quit patches
They gave me nightmares so I discontinued and went cold  turkey.
I have 5 fags in a saucepan on a high shelf , if i have a craving I look at the app and decide itâ€™s not worth undoing what I have achieved
My aim is to put the 5 fags in a bottle of water and  watch the disgusting yellowing and smell occur.

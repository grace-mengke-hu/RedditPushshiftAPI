My current situation - cigarettes

It is my 3rd day w/o any cigarette, yesterday i felt very strong craving but somehow i managed to wait until the craving passed (i roll cigarettes for my friend when i get triggered by him rolling and smoking). It seems i dont have enough motivation and my mind is not setup to critical thinking about cigarettes. Even though i have every single information about cigarettes; that they're a poison, that the feeling of relief is an illusion created by them, thay they are just a coping mechanism etc. (As a non native i sometimes use words that i do not know what means in my language, but i know the meaning in english, sorry for mistakes if any occur) And as i said; i have been lurking this sub for almost a year, have read many texts about quitting, but i think i just NEED to post so i can get my thoughts together. I managed to get almost half a year cigarette free, but the problem is in my marijuana addiction, just had to realize this as i am writing this post. I think i'll just end here and move forward r/leaves, but if you also have some useful information about quitting cross addictions (i smoke spliff almost every day) feel free to respond :)

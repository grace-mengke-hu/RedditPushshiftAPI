Should I reward myself in advance for quitting?

So today is day 6. When I first considered quitting I told myself that I would save my cigarette money and put it towards a new bicycle. Saturday I was riding my old bike and saw a guy selling a very sweet road bike. It would take me approximately 500 days of "savings" to pay for the bike. 

Should I splurge now? I have the money, and I've already promised my SO that I would sell it if I took up the smoking again. That seems to make smoking again very undesirable. 

Or am I delusional and just trying to justify a shiny new toy?

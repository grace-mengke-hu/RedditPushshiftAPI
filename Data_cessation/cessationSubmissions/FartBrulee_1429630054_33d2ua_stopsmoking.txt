Does being around smokers get easier?

Hi there, 8th day of quitting, so far no cigarettes. I have been using an e-cigg which has helped massively although I do eventually plan to wean myself off it.

My question is this, being around friends who smoke is extremely difficult, especially after a few drinks. This is something I'm going to have to deal with as a lot of them smoke, indoors and outdoors. Being around them when they smoke is the only occasion that I get really bad cravings but have held out so far (chain smoking on my e-cigg!). Will being around smokers ever be easy, will I get to a point where I don't care?

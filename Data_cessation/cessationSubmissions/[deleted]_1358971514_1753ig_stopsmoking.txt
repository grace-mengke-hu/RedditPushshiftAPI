6 months smoke free.

Tomorrow will be 6 months free after being a pack a day or more smoker for 10 years. I didn't use any drugs (Chantix) or self-help, I just finally quit. I failed twice in the year before I was successful. Once I admitted to myself I had no reason to continue smoking and every reason to quit, it was much easier. My method was simple. I thought back to how I started smoking. I didn't immediately smoke a pack a day when I started. It was a few here and there and then every time I drank or went to a party. It built up gradually to smoking all the time. So I went backwards. I went from a pack a day to a pack every two days. Then a pack a week. Then only a couple when I was drinking. Then one day I bought a pack of cigarettes and vowed not to open them. I carried them with me, to the bar, to friends houses and left them on the dash of my car, knowing that I was in control. After 3 months I gave the pack away to a friend and never looked back. Not to sound cliche, but you can do it. Anyone can.

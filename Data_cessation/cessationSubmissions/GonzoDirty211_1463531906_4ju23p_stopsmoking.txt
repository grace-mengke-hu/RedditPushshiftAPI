Smoke rant

I used to smoke cigarettes. A lot. I thought it was cool because since the day I was born both my parents smoked like they'd gone out of style (they most definitely did). I started off small when I was like 16 then my habit grew as I started hanging around slithery folks and two faced fake fucks. Enough psychosis led me to getting arrested for assault and turning 18 in a county jail. After I was released, even though I agreed with many of the people in there I don't need drugs, I started smoking like a burnt down house. Overall I'd say I've smoked around 3000 cigarettes in my lifetime. They have definitely taken a toll and many times I found myself wishing I could stop, only by the need to feel something outweighing how much I cared. I am 18 1/2 now and haven't had a cigarette in two weeks, although the cravings haven't stopped entirely. I live with my dad now who chain smokes even when I'm around. It makes me volatile when I can't even roll down a window and breathe. Second hand smoke got so bad this month I ended up covering my hand with blood snot. Not a good day.
My advice is to never even try it, avoid it, and go exercise instead. Cigarettes are the antipath of success. Value your breath, your words, your teeth, your mind, and yourself. You are more important than the bullshit dark catharsis that comes from a "smoke break".

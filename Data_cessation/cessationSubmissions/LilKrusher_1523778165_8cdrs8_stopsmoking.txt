Functioning lungs again

Yesterday I was pretty damn amazed - it was only my day 6 of non smoking. I hit a 5k run and I was able to run all 35mins without stopping once or running out of breath! the difference is so dramatic and it only reminded me what a horrible habit smkoking is and how stressful to my body it was. Next time im hit with a craving this is what ill think about.:)

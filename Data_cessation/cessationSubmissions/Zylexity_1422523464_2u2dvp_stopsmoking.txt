Vacation today is quit day.

So today I'm going on a school trip to Vermont from Ontario for some snowboarding.  I was thinking about bringing a pack with me to the states but I decided not to.  I figured 3 days of snowboarding on the mountains would be a great start to a new me.  

I have one last cigarette left that will be smoked today and it will be enjoyed, missed and savoured, but it will be the last.  

Any last minute tips anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated!

Wish me luck!

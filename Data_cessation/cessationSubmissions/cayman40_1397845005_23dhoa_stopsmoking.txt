Departing thoughts to those on the road to wellness.

At 0700 EST on 18.04.2013 I said farewell and escaped from prison camp Nicotine. On escape day 151, I went to bed and realized the thought of a ciggy had not crossed my mind that day. Maybe I should not have been surprised as every day that passed the thoughts came less and less. But still, victory for me. 

Happily the journey to this anniversary point ended up being far easier than my smoking self would have ever allowed me to believe. So as I depart this place I offer the following to those either thinking about or that have recently made their escape.   


If you are still smoking--stop

Really--JUST STOP DOING IT

This forum is the best place to seek help and offer encouragement

Ciggies are not your friends--they are your guards

If you are in the early days of quitting--GOOD FOR YOU!!!

Yes it gets easier every day
 
Yes it is a challenge for a few days

Man the f$%k up and stop being disgusting

Quit by using whatever means you feel will help

But JUST STOP DOING IT is the best

Everything is better---E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G

3 MONTHS! I know I'm not out of the woods, but I can see the light between the leaves...

Today was one of the hardest days I've had in a long time, starting with an anxiety attack on my bus commute this morning that left me shaking and trying not to cry while walking the last mile to my office in freezing rain. I arrived a half hour late, soaked to the skin from the waist down, unable to hide how upset I still felt, and that image pretty much sums up my entire day. BUT not only did I not smoke, I actually didn't even think of smoking, not even during the hardest parts. I feel free for the first time in a long time.

A huge thanks to everyone on this sub. Thank you for the support and advice; thank you for posting and responding. I really don't think I would have gotten this far without this place. Everyone keep fighting the good fight, even when you're soaked and cold and shaking and crying. :)

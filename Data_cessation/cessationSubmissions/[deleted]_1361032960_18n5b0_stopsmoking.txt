So I'm ditchin' the tobacky...

And after lurking here for, oh, fifty seconds, I saw mentions of e-cigs being a bad way to go. Maybe it's just me then. I recently switched, and the idea of smoking a real cig is just... Gross. And it's only been a few weeks. I'm also already noticing that I puff on the e-cig far less often than I did, about half as much as last week. So, I don't know, if anyone wants to let me know if this is a normal way for things to go down, as they say in the 'hood, it would be much appreciated.

Day 2, white-knuckled through and done. But: BOOZE. What do you do‽

First, happy to be safely in bed no risk of smoking today!  But holeeee shit! I went out to nice dinner with Mom and friend for mom’s bday this evening. Had one aperol cocktail and suddenly all I could think about was my precious chaise lounge in the backyard garden, and wanting to sit out there and crank butts as the sun set. It was bad and I narrowly kept myself on track.

I know I’m not a great drinker, even if I’m not at a place where I’m giving it up entirely...and at times drinking and smoking would feed each other (a bottle of wine by the pool at night while I smoke and play online euchre for hours? Don’t mind if I do...). Looking at this quit, which I really want to nurture, I am wondering if I have some bigger fish to fry. Thirty days of sober? A million days of sober?‽ 

What worked for you?  Thanks!

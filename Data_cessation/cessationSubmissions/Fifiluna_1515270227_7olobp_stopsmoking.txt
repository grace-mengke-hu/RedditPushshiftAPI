Having the worst insomnia / anxiety at night

I am on day 5. Started of with the patch. Forced to stop as woke up with major bronchitis and high fever on the 1st and took “advantage” to start the year kicking the habit after 25 plus years smoking, over a pack a day and more on social nights.. 

Decided to take patch of yesterday but at night I thought I was loosing my mind. 

Woke up much better but put another path on as this scared me badly last night. Ended up taking a Xanax just to sleep but woke up early early. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Much thanks.

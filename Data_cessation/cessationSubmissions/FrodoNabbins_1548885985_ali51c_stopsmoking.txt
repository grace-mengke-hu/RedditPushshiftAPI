***Don't Quit***  
by  
John Greenleaf Whittier

  
When things go wrong as they sometimes will,  
When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,  
When the funds are low and the debts are high  
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,  
When care is pressing you down a bit,  
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.  
Life is strange with its twists and turns  
As every one of us sometimes learns  
And many a failure comes about  
When he might have won had he stuck it out;  
Don't give up though the pace seems slow—  
You may succeed with another blow.  
Success is failure turned inside out—  
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,  
And you never can tell just how close you are,  
It may be near when it seems so far;  
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—  
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.

(I have it hanging on my fridge and look at it every day... This constant mantra has helped me quit drinking, quit smoking, and continue to recover from mental health issues. I blew it off the first time someone gave it to me... But it has always been there as a constant reminder. Though the weight of its words were difficult to swallow at first, it rings true every day for me.)

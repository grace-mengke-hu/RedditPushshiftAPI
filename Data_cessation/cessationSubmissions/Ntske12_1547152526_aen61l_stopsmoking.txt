Stopped smoking now struggling to quit vaping

So I started smoking at the age of 17, and it was only ever social. I never brought cigarettes and just used to bum of my friends. I come from a strict no smoking home, so never smoked at home, only when I was out. 
When I turned 18, I started buying cigarettes myself, still not smoking much due to my strict household, but this changed when I met my ex at 19. 
His parents smoked and so did he, so I could smoke way more. This turned into me having to always sneak out my home to smoke, going through around 1/2 a pack a day, so not much. 

Went onto a vape last year, I didn’t find it hard at all. Now it’s my first day using 0 nicotine in my vape; it’s only been a few hours but I can feel it. 

I haven’t found many success stories around people dropping to 0 nic and then kicking the habit altogether. 

Any tips or tricks? Did it work for you?

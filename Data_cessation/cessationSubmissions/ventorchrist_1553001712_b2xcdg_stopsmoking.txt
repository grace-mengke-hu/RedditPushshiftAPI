My friend is dying from lung cancer. He’s not that old. He is a smoker. It has spread to his brain. His left leg and arm is paralyzed. I found out and saw him 5 days ago. I haven’t smoked since. It’s a horrible way to go. Please,all of us must stop. This is the only life we have. It’s not worth it.

I can't stop eating - hungry even after a full meal?

I've gained 20 pounds in the past few months since I quit smoking. I've always had a pretty sensible diet, was on the lower side of a "normal" BMI. I just checked and I'm technically overweight now.

A cigarette used to be my definitive "this meal is over" signal. Now I find myself constantly snacking (probably where I'd be smoking a cigarette). What used to be a "big" meal for me now only satisfies me for about 20 minutes before I find my stomach growling again.

It doesn't help that food suddenly tastes amazing. I feel like my senses of taste and smell are super-heightened. I can't walk down the street without getting a whiff of "restaurant" and thinking about food.

I'm feeling so self-conscious about this. I used to have a naturally slender frame and now I have fat rolls. I plan on going to the gym to tone up a bit, but somehow I don't think that will make me any less hungry. It takes me longer to fall asleep because by the time I'm in bed, I'm already hungry again.

This sucks. What can I do at this point? Have I already replaced cigarettes with food?

impulse control

Today was a bad day for cravings but it's near midnight so it looks like I've made it.  Want to thank the poster(s) who suggested repeating "Smoking is not an option" when things get bad.  I've been thinking too about how this is really a matter of impulse control.  Along those lines, I imagined a situation where, bizarrely, I found myself standing next to Dick Cheney at a cocktail party and, even more bizarrely, holding a coconut cream pie covered in a think layer of whipped cream.  You can imagine the impulse, no?  And yet I am sure I could resist gently mushing it into the war criminal's face.  If I could be confident in resisting that delicious impulse, I can resist the cravings for nicotine.

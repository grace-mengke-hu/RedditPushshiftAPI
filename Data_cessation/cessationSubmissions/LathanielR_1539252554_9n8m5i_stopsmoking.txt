Time flies

It feels like yesterday I started on my nicotine free road. To be fair It was 1 year and 1 month ago, yesterday. It's hard to believe it's been so long when, every second took an hour when I started the journey. The two week mark seemed an impossibility with the sluggishness of time. 
For those of you just starting on your journey or others wandering if it gets easier. I'm here to tell you that , sooner than you realise you will go days and weeks without thinking about cigarettes, I'm here to tell you it gets easier and is infinitely possible. I'm not going to lie to you and say I never think I'd like a smoke, I do, but it happens infrequently and has become so easy to say no, and as soon as I say no, the feeling disappears. Spend time here, get an app and learn to say NO. You can do it. Good luck

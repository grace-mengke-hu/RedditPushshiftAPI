5 Year Anniversary!

Hello everyone. I haven’t posted to (or even visited) this sub in a number of years. I’m stopping by today to share my 5th anniversary with you all. 

There was a time in my life when I thought I would never be a non-smoker. When I was a 19-year-old college sophomore I wrote a persuasive essay about smokers’ rights, and how today’s generation of smokers are subject to overly burdensome restrictions. My focus was on the prohibition of smoking in open air spaces. I got an A on it, and the professor read it aloud to the class as an example of how to properly write a persuasive essay. I wish I still had a copy of it. 

Fast forward to today. I’m 32 years old. I smoked for 12 years. I’m 5 years removed from my addiction to the demon plant. This sub was instrumental in helping me reach my goal of quitting smoking. I’m back to share my stats, via a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/a1NSwvL.png) of my QuitNow! app. The amount of money and cigarettes is truly staggering! 

For those who think quitting is impossible; it isn’t. For those who have quit but are thinking of starting again; don’t. There is no moment, no stress, no difficulty in your life that can be made better by smoking. Smoking only enhances your difficulties. Stay strong fellow quitters!

Just discovered this subreddit. Got some questions and need advice.

I have been smoking for the past 4-5 years and while I was smoking about 4-5 a day cigs on my "peak" years, I've cut down to about 1-2 per day for the last two years. I have no addiction I think since I can go months without having a need to smoke or anything. Last time I smoked was a week ago as of writing this post and I need to know how much approximate damage I may have caused to my lungs. 

I will quit smoking altogether since I'm already replacing my "daily" smokes with chewing gums or "pan-masalas". Am I on the right track?

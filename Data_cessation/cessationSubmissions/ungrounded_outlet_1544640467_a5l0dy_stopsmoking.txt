So Imma be real with y’all

Things that changed for me this past year:

* I have gained 30lbs (13,61 kg)
* I realized I have a relatively severe drinking problem
* I’ve lost touch with a large number of my friends
* I’ve lost control of my emotions

But the above points only show part of the story. Indeed:

* I’ve started seeing a therapist. Among the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life.
* I realized that cigarettes performed a function for me. In essence I was self-medicating to help my depression
* I’ve quit drinking alcohol. It’s been just over 2 weeks. I feel more focused and \*sharp\*.

For me personally, quitting smoking was just chapter one, or just the outermost layer of my recovery. I still have a long way to go. 

Let’s talk about the good stuff:

* Teeth/gums are healing. I didn’t even realize they were messed up until my last dentist appointment over the summer. I had neglected to take great care of my teeth and was super surprised when the hygienist praised how great my teeth and gums looked. Even when not taking great care of my teeth, the healing was so significant that they looked phenomenally better.
* Self confidence. Man, I wasn’t aware how self-conscious I was about the way I smelled after having a smoke. I would even have recurring dreams where I would enter an elevator after smoking and pretty girls would make faces at me. Truth be told that’s not that different from every day but I digress…
* Saving Money. Holy Fucking Ball Sack smoking is expensive. I set up my smoking app for a very conservative cigarette pack price of $6. And over the course of a year I’ve saved $2190. That is a Fucking Shit-Fuckton of money. It has been very rewarding to treat myself this Christmas. I shudder to think about how much I’ve spent on my nearly decade-long pack-a-day habit…

Challenges:

* This is absolutely not my first quit attempt. I would guess that I’ve had about 7-10 serious quit attempts. People like to say that “There’s no better time than now,” but for me, it was best to quit when I was mentally ready.
* For me strangely enough, I wasn’t big into smoking when I was drinking. It makes me feel nauseous. So I would still go out to bars and hang out outside but just not smoke. My friends\* didn’t seem to care and I didn’t come off as judgmental.
* I absolutely replaced cigarettes with alcohol. That was a huge mistake, but an easy trap to fall into. I didn’t realize what a problem I had until I described my day to my therapist: 2-3 Maker's on the rocks right after work, 3-4 more at bar at night, 1-2 whiskeys at another bar, followed by grotesque amounts of fast food. I’m talking like 2 Jack in the Box munchie meals. I can’t believe I was able to force down that amount of garbage. And of course I was driving myself to all of these places. Lastly, I would get home and pass out in bed next to my girlfriend. In the morning I would be hungover and have difficulty remembering driving home. So this is embarrassing, I’ve got tears coming my face at work. It’s OK. I know I have a problem. I want all of you to know you’re not alone.
* I started having emotional rollercoasters where I would be verbally abusing and spend hours ranting about dumb shit. It wasn’t a normal sort of anger. I punched a wall. Luckily the wall and my hand were undamaged. I immediately found a therapist and made an appointment.

Takeaways:

* Honestly, my rock bottom was quite a bit higher than many people. I’m very, very, \*very\* lucky.
* The Smoke Free app was crucial for me. Especially the craving logging the first few weeks. It took a craving, and made me realize a craving is my body adjusting to a healthier lifestyle.
* I quit cold turkey. I’m not saying this is the only way or the best way. It’s just what works best for me. I’ve tried, the patch, the gum, and medication (Welbutrin?) but cold turkey was the only method I would ever stick with.
* I don’t have a magic bullet or “1 weird trick” for y’all. Honestly, I just got better at quitting every time I made a serious attempt. It’s possible that I relapse tomorrow. That would suck, but everything I’ve learned this time around (my previous attempt was &lt; 4 months) will help me going forward.
* I'm a 32 year old male. I started smoking at 18. In my early 20s I started my pack-a-day habit.
* The human brain doesn’t like change and will throw tantrums. But over time you can develop good habits. Never be embarrassed to seek out help. Feel free to PM me.

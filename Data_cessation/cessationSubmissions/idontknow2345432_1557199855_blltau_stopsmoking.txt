I had my last cigarette 58 hours ago and everything has gone to shit.

I stopped smoking because someone I like (J) asked me too and I will admit it is a bad habit and is something I am willing to fix.  Yesterday J and several mutual friends (D and M) came over to my place and we all drank together.  As I was walking with M and J back to get them back home, I thought I heard M bad-mouth me to J (M knows I like J).  I am already on edge because I quitting and J and I dropped off M and I took J back to hers.  The conversation got personal on the way to hers and she asked me out for coffee I made a joke about it being a date and laughed she said no it was not.  I then went to go talk to M as I thought she bad mouthed me and wanted to clear it up so as to not let negative feelings fester.  M and I cleared things up and it appears there was a miscommunication and I misheard (I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.) This morning I text J about coffee and she had to reschedule I get in contact with M who says J messaged her about last night worried about me, and J made it appear that I came to hers because I was going through nicotine withdrawal and was drunk. (To be fair I was drunk (as we all were), but I think it is best to not let negative thoughts and feelings fester better to talk and get things understood).   I am supposed to be having coffee with J tomorrow but who knows (J's wisdom teeth are coming in and causing her pain (this is actually true)) and I realize I'm rambling but **I JUST REALLY WANT A FUCKING CIGARETTE RN** to get rid of this damn stress.

Question for people who used the patch to quit.

So I am on my 6th day without a cigarette (woot woot) abd am doing pretty good with that. I only get cravings in moments of high stress and right before bed  (I used to smoke before bed and if I didn't, I got restless legs like crazy when I laid down. Tackling that currently with the help of Unisom.) 

I am using step 2 of the patch for another two weeks, and then plan on moving on to step 3. My question is, did those of you who used the patch have to go through withdrawals after you quit using the patch? Or was the jump from 7mg over 24 hours to no nicotine small enough that it didn't bother you?? 

I had been a smoker for 11 years, and at the end, was a half to 2/3 pack a day smoker, and so I just really want to be mentally prepared if the withdrawals will happen then.

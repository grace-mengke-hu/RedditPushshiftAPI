One month down! Good feels inside....

A bit lateon this post, actually, but I've not smoked since Oct 30th. Feeling good, now off the champix too!

Champix really helped me if you're considering it, read about the side effects and make a call, talk to your Dr. Not smoking is fucking awesome, keep not smoking if you're reading this!

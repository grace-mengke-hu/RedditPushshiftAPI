I’m ready to quit, but I’m nervous.

Hello! I’m 27 years old, and I’ve been smoking since I was 13. For a long time I was only a social smoker, up until about 5 years ago. I now smoke almost an entire pack a day. My morning consists of 3-4 cigarettes before work, 3-4 during work (which I’m totally not supposed to do..another reason I want to quit. I’m risking my job for this habit! Thankfully I’ve never been caught but I know it’ll come some day.) and 5-8 before bed, more if I’m stressed or go out after work. 

I have wanted to quit for the last year. My body feels like shit, I have anxiety and it seems to make it worse, I smell like an ash tray and have to wash some of my clothes more often and spray enough perfume to bust a layer in the ozone.  I think it’s also contributed to my large weight loss that I’m not happy with. I have friends who don’t smoke and I know it’s annoying when I have to stop what we’re doing to light up. My energy levels are always low. I just look and feel sick. I’m tired of it. 

The problem is, I’m scared. I’ve gone without before and the results were not pretty. Extreme irritability, anxiety, stress. My mental state plummets. My boyfriend smokes, not as much as me, but I know being around him could be a trigger for me and I don’t want to be nasty to him while I’m withdrawing. We discussed quitting together but I’m not sure if he’s serious. My mom lives with me and smokes in the house (refuses not to. Entirely different story for another subreddit) and I know it is important for me to keep my space smoke free to reduce the withdrawal and temptation. I don’t really know what to do to combat that. 

I’m considering the gum, as I don’t want to take medication to stop and I also don’t want the patch. I would like my quit day to be Monday. Anyone have some tips to get started, help with cravings, withdrawal, and how to handle quitting in my environment?

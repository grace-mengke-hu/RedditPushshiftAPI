Hair loss from smoking?

Hey y'all. Been smoking for about 7.5 years now and made it my New Years resolution to quit this year, finally! Haven't smoked in about a week now with only a few psychological cravings, luckily. Still going to have many cravings when drinking, which ice only done once since quitting, but I know I have the willpower to get thru those.

My question, and I haven't found a definitive answer from a trusted, reliable source online yet, is whether or not smoking damages your hair/leads to hair loss?  Any answers?

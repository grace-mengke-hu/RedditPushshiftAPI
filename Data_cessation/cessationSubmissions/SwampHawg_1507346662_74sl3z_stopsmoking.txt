Just a quick detour, I'd like to say

that I like our subreddit for its informality and supportiveness.  Some of these other subreddits have more unwritten rules than a Japanese tea party, and that's why I like ours, we're bonded by a shared real, and it's nice to find that in a sea of strangers.

Wherever you are, up or down, you've got a friend here.

24 hours have passed

I have been trying again and again, but finally I have made it through 24 hours. I plan to make it through to the rest of my life.

My motivation for quitting:

1. I don't want to develop terrible diseases
2. I want to be free from addiction
3. I want my body to heal, so that I can become ultra-fit again
4. I don't want the stress that comes from smoking
5. I don't want the reputation (and self-image) of being a smoker
6. I want to save money
7. I don't want to harm anyone else by smoking

My plan for quitting

* Exercise 1-2 times every day (many different types of exercise; Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, triathlon, climbing, yoga, walking, bootcamp and fitness). This helps me build become strong again, get feel good chemicals flowing through my body (a better way to deal with stress than smoking) and build my self-image as an athlete/healthy person (smoking does not fit in that image). That is my main reason to exercise, I view myself as someone who is fit, it's how I want to live my life.
* Meditate every day. Start with 10 minutes, but increase to 20 or more eventually. Perhaps meditate multiple times per day sometimes, or go on meditation retreat. I hope to be able to calm my monkey brain a bit, that has many benefits besides dealing with my addictive tendencies. I hope to learn to be calm, peaceful, joyful, focused and disciplined.
* Eat healthy. Another way to take good care of my body.
* In the first weeks, reward myself for every day that I don't smoke. Sometimes with fun activities, sometimes with presents for myself. Such as a new plant, things for my home. I am investing in that anyways. Or do relaxing activities.
* Ride out the cravings. I am prepared for them. They are very short lived anyways. Will drink a glass of water or something when they happen. Or do a bit of meditation.

My plan for today

* Go running (8 kilometers - slow)
* Reward myself for this first day by buying a new printer/scanner. Very useful, because I am organizing my whole life, including my home, and so it's nice to be able to digitize (and then throw away) a lot of paperwork, as well as print some things that help me stay organized (a cleaning schedule, an exercise schedule). And I'd like to make and print photos.
* Meditate for 10 minutes.

Really really struggling

I just can't stop. I've read the book 5 times. Tried replacing smoking with snacks, or vaping.  Tried cold turkey so many times I lost count.  I smoke much more consciously now so I realize how unfulfilling it is.  I've been in chantix for almost 20 days and it hasn't done anything. At all.  I talk to a therapist.  I realize how much extra energy and frustration I'm trying to self medicate with cigarettes.... None of this is helping.


17 years and I can't even make it 20 hours before I breakdown.  I don't know wtf to do anymore.  I can't possibly be a lifetime smoker. I don't want to be.  I want control over this.

It's a good thing I never tried heroin.  :/

Why does nobody actually do it the logic way?

I see so many posts here about cravings and massive signs of withdrawal and I just don't understand if the people want to suffer or they like to suffer? For me the logic way was just reducing it slowly, until the habit is dead, slow and painless! I smoked like 6-10 cigs a day, then 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1/2,.... a half, 2 tokes, 1 toke and then nothing. 
Stopping to smoke did never feel bad, because I always knew that I can smoke later at the end of the day.
    **Edit:** As I mentioned in my replies, I understood that my method is not the only logic way, I also understood that this didn't work for the most of you, but however it worked for me. I offended some of the direct quitters which was not my intention. I hope that some people will just read this and if only one can stop smoking with my method which I call the Fade Out, I'm glad that I could help you!

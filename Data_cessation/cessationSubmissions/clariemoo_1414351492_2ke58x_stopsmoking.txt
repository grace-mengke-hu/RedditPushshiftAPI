Victory at boozey smokey house party but second hand smoking?

Went to a house party on friday: we were only three non smokers (including a dude with an e-cig)... and with cold shitty weather everyone was (chain)smoking indoors... I swear the room was so foggy ... very surreal...

Even if completely drunk (and people feeling very generous with their cigs) I  didn't crack once (did have MASSIVE cravings in the beginning and then they passed once I got over the first and after awhile didn't even notice anymore)! Been two months since i quit and still a little doubtful if going out so Fuck yeah!

In addition to the massive hangover the next day I feel like I  have a shitty sore throat as if I had smoked 40000 packs :( ...  but haven't ...

Does 2nd hand smoking also mean inhaling nicotine? Nicotine withdrawal was hardcore enough in month one of quitting and am wondering if  it doesn't trigger another set of withdrawal symptoms having been exposed a full night to smoking

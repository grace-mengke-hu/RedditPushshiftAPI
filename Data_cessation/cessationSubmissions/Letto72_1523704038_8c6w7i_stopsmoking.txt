Quitters Flu?

Hi everyone, 

Smoked for about 6-9 months after developing the habit from visiting Japan. Started around August 2017 and was smoking 3-4 cigs a day on average. Mainly I kept the habit up because my housemates were full time smokers and it became a social thing, but I got out of that environment which helped me quit cold turkey. At the start of 2018 it was on and off for 2 weeks at a time. Quitters flu hit every time, and you'd think I'd stop just because that was a pain in the arse just as much as the initial withdrawals. Honestly regret picking it. So far its been 28 days clean, and I definitely feel much better, less lethargic, more energised and my quitters flu has gotten better over time. Only had a cough on and off, sometimes deep, and an especially blocked nose. Wondering if any of you after quitting have experienced flu like symptoms like this? How long for and how long does it last for?

I know that I haven't really been smoking for that long but this page has really helped me out. 

Cheers.

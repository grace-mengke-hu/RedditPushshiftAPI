Started smoking to stop binge eating

I quit smoking about two months ago and it was not so hard. However, I did have cravings on some days. Every time I wanted to smoke, I had a delicious meal instead and this pattern quickly got out of control. I started eating almost double the amount of food I'd usually have and in just 2 months, I gained 8kgs! This is literally the heaviest I've ever weighed. I am so desperate to lose the weight now that I've decided to smoke two cigarettes today after the whole 2-month smoke free spell.
I know this post is not really going to help anyone, I just wanted to rant.

If you guys have any strategies to lose weight that you've gained after quitting, please let me know :)

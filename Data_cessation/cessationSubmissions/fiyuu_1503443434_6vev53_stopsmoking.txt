I came back to my hometown after i quit.

I was at outside of the city for 1 month and i decided to quit. It has been 21 days since i have quitted.

I came back to my hometown, and welcomed by my friends which are i associated with smoking.

Drinked with them had big hard urges to smoke and that time i ALMOST slipped but DID NOT.

Ohhh yeah meeeeen, i came home i feel like i had a big fucking accomplishment. Like did something good to proud, not only that i am using this words i am feeling it.

And i imagine that unbearable remorse when i got home if i had smoke tonight. It would have been hard man..

Now i go to sleep with comfortable level A+ damn.

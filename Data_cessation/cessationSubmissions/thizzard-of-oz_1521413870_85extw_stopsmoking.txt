Day 2!

My last attempt at quitting was the most successful one yet. I smoked after a month of going cold turkey because of some bad relationship drama. I realize that it was a poor decision to start smoking again. This time I know I can be successful, and I won't give into urges when life gets tough. Does anyone have tips for when life gets hard and your brain starts rationalizing having "just one cigg"?I'm quitting drinking at the same time (drank nearly every day for years) does anyone have tips for doing both at once? I know that will make it harder but I want to be a better, healthier person, and prove to myself that I can be stronger than my addictions! Thank you for reading and for any advice!

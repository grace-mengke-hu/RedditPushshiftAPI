How long did it take for your lungs to feel clean and healthy?

I've been going for just over 3 weeks and I already feel a lot better. But now 100% yet, I still have sole symptoms of the quitter's flu. How long did it take for you to totally heal from this?

It's ok for me if it takes long, I've got time. Of course I'd prefer if the healing happens very rapidly, but I am grateful already that it happens at all and determined to keep on going.

Successful quitters, How?

I've had a few attempts to quit which were successful for no longer than a month or two. But as of the last year or so I have been getting down on myself for how much/long I've been smoking.  I'm way too young to already have been smoking for 7 years and I want to quit.  Advice is appreciated. 
(also, I'm sorry but I don't consider quitting a 5 cig a day habit the same as a pack a day quitter so I guess I'm looking for some seasoned veteran advice.)

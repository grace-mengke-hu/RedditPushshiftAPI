What effects do the chemicals in cigs have on the brain/mind after several years of use?

I feel like I'm less creative and dumber than I was 7 or so years ago, before I started smoking.  This could have nothing to do with cigs cuz I've had a lot change and happen in that time, but it got me wondering about what effects cigs have on one's cognitive faculties/functioning (idk if I'm using that term right), creativity, ambition, quickness/alertness, etc..

Anybody having skin issues?

This is probably the 3rd time Im gave the deathsticks the boot; each and every time i break out in a horrible 'rash' on my face. Red blothy skin appears on my cheeks and gradually becomes drier and itchier as the days go by. I drink plenty of water 5pint glasses a day plus herbal teas, eat pretty healthy and do moderate exercise. Im wondering if anyone else experiences/experienced this? Ive tead a lot about it being to do with releasing toxins and jut part of the cleanse and 'healing crisis'. Its difficult though as it definitely affects your self confidence and sometimes cause more stress which i turn is goin to make things worse. 
Every other occassion I started smoking again as I couldnt take the skin problems anymore (vanity eh!) but I really want to stay off them this time! What the hell have we been inhaling over the years!!?!

Tomorrow will be day one with no cancer sticks, but I will be vaping.

Hey everyone! Just looking for some support. I am quitting smoking while living with a house full of smokers. But I know I can be stronger than my cravings... I hope. I've got to do this though, for my son. I want to be around for all of those milestones in his life.

I wish you all luck with your quitting, too!

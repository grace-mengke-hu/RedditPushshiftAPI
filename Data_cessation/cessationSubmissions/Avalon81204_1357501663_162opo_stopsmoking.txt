Got really sick after 1 day of no cigs. Coincidence? 

Or lungs punishing me for all the mistreatment? I came down with a flu like thing Wednesday night and am still nursing quite the cough and mild fever. Did quitting kinda open my lungs for germs to get in there?

The only good thing about it was it made me not want a cig because I knew it would hurt like hell to smoke one.

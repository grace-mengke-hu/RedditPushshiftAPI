Am I addicted?

Ok so I've smoked for about 2 years now and I never really had a problem not smoking for several days. I went to the seaside with my parents this week and I haven't smoked for 7 days, today being day 7. I had no issues whatsoever, no withdrawal or anything. I might have been a little more irritatable but I am usually like that anyways. Am I addicted? Or do I just not get addicted so easily? If I start again will I be able to quit as easily as I did now? I smoke about half pack a day.

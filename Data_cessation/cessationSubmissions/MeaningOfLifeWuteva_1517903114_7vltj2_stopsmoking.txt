Preparing to quit

I want to break free of cigarettes. Mid-january I set my quit date to be the 24th of february, bc there wont be much going on in the following week. Im now trying to prepare.
So Id like to know, in hindsight, what would have helped if youd known it before quiting? Should I use gum or patches? What preparation did you do, that was crucial? And what "button" did you push in your mind, to "switch" to being a non-smoker? How long will the really bad cravings last?
Im 33 yrs old and smoked have of my life, one and a half packs a day. Tried to quit once about 8 yrs ago, made it only three days...
Im just fed up with this addiction, its holding me back, how can I remember this, when the cravings show up? 
Thx for any advice and experience! Best wishes to all of you!

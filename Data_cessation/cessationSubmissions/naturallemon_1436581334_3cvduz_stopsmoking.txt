Quitting brings out some strange motives in friends..

I was drinking with a friend of mine recently, and told her it'd been more than a week for me without cigs. 

Her response? "But you can't just quit cold turkey! Are you sure you don't wanna go out to the store?"

I said no. Proud of myself, disturbed at her priorities. She doesn't even smoke! But now at least I know I can turn down that particular question!

Wishing everyone here a willful day <3

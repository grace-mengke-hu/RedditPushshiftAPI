Experiences with Champix?

So i've been on champix now for 2 weeks. I haven't really stopped smoking yet but i have significantly cut down my intake from about 20 a day to maybe 1 or 3 a day (pub visits dependant). I have had 4 days smoke free, two of which were in a row, and it felt much less of a struggle than my last quitting attempt with patches & gum. 

I'd like to hear from anyone who has also tried champix? hopefully with some success. How long were you taking it for in total, and after having stopped smoking? Did you find it a challenge once the champix wore off?  Any experiences or advice would be great :)

I'm at 27 days

31 years old, had been smoking since age 16. I was usually smoking 2-3 packs a week, mostly when drinking, but I'm going through a rough patch in life and for the past few months I was a chimney. I was so stressed out that I would get in my car for a 15 minute drive and smoke 5 cigarettes in that time. 


I tried quitting so many times before and it never lasted more than a week or two. I would have a few drinks or a shitty day and be craving one really bad and give in and buy a pack. 


This is the easiest it's ever been for me and I didn't even plan it. I went to visit family for Easter and after a long weekend, I had a 5 hour drive back home. I left my parents house at 3 am because I was driving straight to work. I didn't have any cigarettes left and didn't feel like stopping because I was so tired, so I just got the road. It's a long, boring drive and normally I would have been lighting up every half hour. I made it through the drive without really even thinking about it and just kept going. 

I can't believe how easy it's been. I've had a few small cravings and that's it. I've still been going out drinking on the weekends, and aside from one night where I bummed 2 cigarettes at a baseball game, smoked them in succession and felt like shit after, the cravings have been minimal. I don't know what's made this time so much different for me, but here's hoping that this continues and that this is my last time ever quitting.

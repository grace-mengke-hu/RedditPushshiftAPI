01/16/2019, also known as day #14

So here I am again. Almost at the [two week mark](https://i.imgur.com/ydFAw87.png). Except I already saved [â‚¬50,-](https://i.imgur.com/1IrdZiP.png), but I haven't gotten the [badge](https://i.imgur.com/ALnEvVJ.png), for some reason. Anyone know what's up with that?  
Well, today was a weird day. I felt slightly better (damn flu), and managed to sleep in a bit, although I still woke up a lot during the night. I can't remember the dreams though. Sometimes I wonder if I should write them down, but most of the time they are so disturbing that I'd rather forget about them asap.  
The cravings were back today. Sadly. I only tracked one in the app, but I also realised that I kind of thought about cigarettes more often than normal. Maybe I dreamed of smoking, I don't know. For the past days, whenever I dreamed of cigarettes, the next day was harder. So it's possible, I don't know.  

Anyway, how have you all been holding up? Still going strong? I will not smoke with anyone of you today.

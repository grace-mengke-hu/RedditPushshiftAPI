My math is bad...but ummm...does 731 days mean two years smoke free!!! HELL YEAH!

Guys...it is so worth quitting. Keep your eyes on the prize...and trust me...it gets easier. 

I was a certified smoker for more than 10 years, smoking a pack a day, sometimes more. You saw me, you smelled me! But...two years since I kicked this habit, I dont even consider myself an ex smoker, I am a non smoker. 

You guys can do it too!

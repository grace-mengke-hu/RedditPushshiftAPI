One week nicotine free. (10 yr habit)

I had my last cigarette on March 1st. I then weaned myself off using nicorette 4mg gum. I had my last piece of gum 1 week ago today. One built-in quitting aid for getting off of nicorette was the horrendous nightmares it caused me. Anyway, dropping an 10 year expensive habit feels great. Thanks.

I need help.

I have smoked most of my life except a 6 year period where I quit. I feel so unhealthy and worry so much. But it's like the more I worry the more stressed I feel and the more I smoke

I've tried pretty much everything now. Ecigs, patches, Allen carr, gum...I feel like I need  locking in a room so I can't get out to smoke

Thank you

I just had to take a moment and really say thanks to all the wonderful people who populate this amazing subreddit. I spent years really wanting to stop smoking but always able to justify, excuse and maintain that I was destined to be a smoker my whole life.  Finding this place, this tribe of non smoking humans who could understand, see through the bullshit, give advice and kick butt made me see that I was not alone.  I could never have made it to a month smoke free without you. You have made me realize my own power and have held me accountable. Seeing how others have managed, and how some have fallen, has given me more tools and strength to not smoke. This old broad, who is now a proud non smoker, thanks you all.

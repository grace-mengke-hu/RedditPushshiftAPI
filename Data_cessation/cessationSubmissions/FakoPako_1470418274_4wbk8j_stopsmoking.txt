Hair

7 months in. Noticed something that I really didn't think about. My hair. It stopped falling out! Oddly enough, it feels so much stronger too! It's so shinny!

That is all I got for now. 

P.S: I am going to have tons of Corona Lights tonight. You know what the best thing is? I will not smoke and I will not have that crazy "smoked 2 packs in 3 hours" hangover tomorrow!

BOOM! How do you like them apples?

Carry on...

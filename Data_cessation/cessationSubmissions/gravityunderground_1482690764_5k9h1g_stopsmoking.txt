Even Santa Claus annoys the crap out of me.

Everyone is annoying and everything is bothersome. I feel like I'm walking around with a cupful of boiling water filled to the brim. One jerky move and yikes. Gotta be mindful that it's all chemically related to withdrawal. Can't wait until I get back to being a laid back, nice guy again.

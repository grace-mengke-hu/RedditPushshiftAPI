Just Hit The 48 Hour Mark! This is NOT easy!

So 2 days without a cigarette.. The cravings are becoming INTENSE. I'm getting hot flashes, headaches, chest pain and bloating. My breathing and sense of smell has improved ALOT in just 2 days of no cigarettes, however, this is a REALLY tough road. My brain is telling me to have just 1 cigarette and it will be ok.. but if I do that, I know I will just have another within the hour and I'm back to being a smoker. I really want to get through this, I don't want to smoke anymore because I want my health to improve. What are some things I can do right now to get my mind off the cigarette? Help me Reddit!

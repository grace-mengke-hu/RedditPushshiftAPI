Hey guys- I'm a "new" to Reddit, though a long time lurker. I quit yesterday, but I am using the JUUL. It's still so, so hard. I made it. I did cry once lol but just woke up, day 2. I hate the empty feeling... but what I hate more is that I even have that. Who is using vaping to help?

 Even with NRT it's rough, and that makes me feel so weak. 
17 years a smoker, and I'm 32. I'm so done. I have two kids that need me. I just wish I could turn every craving off from my brain. I've tried to quit twice before a long time ago, but I'm definitely way more "ready" this time.

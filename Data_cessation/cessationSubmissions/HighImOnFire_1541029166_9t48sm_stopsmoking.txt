Law of attraction; will it help me quit smoking?

I will get over this addiction and have healthy lungs again.

I will stop wheezing and coughing, and will bike further and faster than before.

I don't need nicotine.

I will not bike into town in an hour and grab a pack of over-priced smokes from the nearest convince store. (like last time)

I will not bum smokes off anyone, my parents, friends or landlords. (like the time before that)

I will not scrounge for cigarette butts and roll my own gross smokes. (like I've regrettably done before.)

I will never smoke tobacco again.

I will not snap on anyone during this.

I will not cave into the addiction or redirect it at others.

That is the last smoke I will ever smoke.

I will breath healthy and become better than I was the day before, every day forward.

I will remember that I wrote this.

Just copypasta'ing this here. Thinking if I commit to this enough it'll be the thing that makes me quit for real.

7 days non-continuous

Hi, I just thought I'd post what I have done so far. I stopped for 3 days using NRT, then I smoked about 5 cigarettes on the 4th day. I stopped again for three days using NRT and between today and yesterday I have smoked 3 cigarettes. I don't have any more cigarettes and I have about  nicotine lozenges left. I'm in an area where I cannot buy NRT. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on getting through this after my NRT runs out. (Probably by the end of the day)

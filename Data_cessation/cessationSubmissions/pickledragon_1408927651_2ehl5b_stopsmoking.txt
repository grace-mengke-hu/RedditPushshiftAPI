17 days smoke-free - and a blog about how pickles helped me quit.

I quit smoking 17 days ago. My smoking "wasn't a big deal" because I was "only smoking when drinking", but I ended up drinking to excess every night in order to smoke, and I was in a wickedly destructive positive feedback loop.

I read online that replacing smoking with another behavior worked for some people, and I had pickles on hand, so I went with that. I know it's bizarre, but I was desperate for a way to stop, and it actually worked.

I also read that publishing my journey would make me feel more accountable for staying off of my vices, so I started a blog. I've just been sharing with friends so far, but a buddy linked me to this subreddit and said it might be of interest to you guys. After getting acquainted with the page, I'm really impressed and inspired by the amount of support in these threads. It's awesome. I'm going to stay involved here - both to give and receive support.

Props to everyone here who has decided to stop smoking (and those who have successfully quit!). I'm finding that the process has been really empowering in terms of realizing that I have the strength to make positive change in my own life. I'm trying to share that in my blog.

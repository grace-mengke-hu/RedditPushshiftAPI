Question about second-hand smoke from a non-smoker.

Hey guys, I figured you'd be as good for answering this as anybody! I have a concern about second hand smoke that I am exposed to when I hang out with my best friend.

In the last year or so, he's developed into quite a smoker-- up to around a pack a day, now. He knows I think it's dumb, so I don't beat it over his head, nor do I think I should. But I am having more trouble getting away from his secondhand smoke than I was. It was one thing to stand several lengths away from him when he'd pop out for a smoke, but recently we've started going on long drives, since he has a new car and we both like to go cruising. If we're driving for say, an hour, he'll probably have smoked 6 or so cigarettes by the end of it, maybe 3 to 4 on the lower end. We might go for anywhere from 1 to 3 drives in a week.

He knows that I think it is stanky and gross, so we'll roll all the windows down, but I can't help but feel as though it isn't helping much (since my clothes and nostrils will still smell like smoke later.) I've become concerned about whether or not trying to 'roll with it' is actually an unwise decision, on my part, and I thought you guys might know.

In case it's relevant, they're menthols, and no, I've never smoked cigarettes before. Thanks in advance for the feedback!

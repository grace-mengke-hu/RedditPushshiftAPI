Day 8 and feeling great

I was a smoker for 40 yrs, was going to quit at 30, then 40, then 50, but always found a reason not to quit until...
Anyways I had a cold about 6 weeks ago and couldn't seem to shake the cough and mucous, along with shortness of breath.
Woke up Tuesday Jan 5th and decided today is the day. Was using NRT patches for a few days and then my daughter sent me the link for the smoke free app, which in turn pointed me to the Alan Carr book. Now I'm not part of any cult following, but I started reading the book on Jan 9th, threw away the patch and am happy to say I feel like a new person already. I realize I still have a long road ahead and there are going to be mountains to climb.
This was my first real attempt to stop smoking and I hope it will be my last.. The one thing that keeps popping in my head is "it's not what I've given up, it is what I have gained" 
Good Luck all

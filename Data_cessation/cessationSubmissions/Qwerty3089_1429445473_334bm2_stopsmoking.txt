Thanks for all the support. 20year smoker a few days shy of 2 months and couldn't be happier

So figured I'd share my success with anyone that cares. I never in a million years thought I'd ever be able to quit smoking despite many half hearted attempts in the 20 or so years as a smoker. About two months ago I decided that enough was enough... I tore up and threw out 3/4 of a pack, bought some patches and never looked back (and perhaps most important, found this subreddit/support group)
 
At this point, I'm completely nicotine free and haven't felt better. Being able to breath so deeply is sort of nostalgic as I've been smoking since I was 13years old. The last time air felt so 'fresh', was sometime in the early 90's lol. I took up running since quitting and am running 3-4 times a week up to 4miles at a time. Wheezing is pretty much gone and don't feel like dying is a possibility anymore. Don't get me started on the new found ability to taste/smell.

Anyway... I just wanted to let anyone on the fence about quitting know that it can be done. Cold turkey wasn't an option for me as the withdrawals were extremely intense so had to use a nicotine replacement to ween off it. Do whatever it takes and quit... It's not easy and you really have to want it for yourself but it feels great to not be under the thumb of tobacco/nicotine anymore.

There is no up side to continue smoking :)

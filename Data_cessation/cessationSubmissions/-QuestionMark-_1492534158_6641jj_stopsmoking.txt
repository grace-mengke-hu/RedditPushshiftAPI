After approx 1,100 days, I need to reset the clock.

Quit a few years ago, (lots of help from this sub-reddit too).   Had a rough fall season, and fell off the wagon over the winter.  Time to admit it and reset my badge.  Today's the day I return to being a non-smoker.  Thankfully my smoking roommate left for a vacation until June, so there aren't packs of cigarettes laying around the house anymore, so that should be a huge help.

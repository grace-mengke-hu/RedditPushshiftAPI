Nicotine increases the pleasure gained from activities. Once you're addicted, you'll never experience everyday pleasure the same again until you quit.

10 minutes after every cigarette, your pleasure centers in your brain drop below normal, and you experience dysphoria, albeit not extreme dysphoria.  If you're trying to quit smoking, look forward to being able to actually enjoy life again!

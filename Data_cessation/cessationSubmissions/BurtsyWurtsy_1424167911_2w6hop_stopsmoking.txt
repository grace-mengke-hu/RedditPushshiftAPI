Headaches after 3 days lead to me caving, suggestions for help

Yesterday I caved and smoked. I'd been having horrible headaches and this relieved them. I'd previously been smoking 10 a day and decided to give up cold Turkey.

Does anyone have any suggestions for alternatives? I don't want to go onto vaping because I feel that's just substituting my habit and I'm a poor student so fancy gums and patches are out of the question.

I'm going to give it a go again from tomorrow (lent starting it seems appropriate as others housemates are giving things up to so we can support one another)

Quitting cold turkey

I'm currently only two days into quitting cold turkey, didn't have much cravings until this morning but I'm starting to get a few spikes of just sadness and this shit ain't nice. I'm going to push through it all and get to where I want to be because for the first time in my 6 years of smoking I feel ready to do it but also the fear of nothing improving in time and always feeling sad, scares me and also makes me think what's the point but I already know why I'm quitting. Anyways just wanted to share my thoughts and tell me how you're getting on with your quitting journey!

So it's been 11 days. Is this... it?

Since I quit, I have hardly had any cravings.  I feel pretty much... fine.  Better, even.  I had one moment when I had a dream about something that made me angry, so in the dream I wanted a cigarette to calm down.  When I woke up, I still kind of wanted the cigarette, but it faded quickly.

So, is this it?  Is this what I've been avoiding?  This is the horrible terrible process of quitting?  I'm sure it differs from person to person but... no withdrawal?  No irritability?  Nothing?  I feel almost *no* difference between then and now, except that I've already saved over $60.

I'm sure I'll have my moments somewhere down the line... right?

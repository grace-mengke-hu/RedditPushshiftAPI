How do I encourage my boyfriend to quit smoking with me?

I want to quit smoking.  Its come to the point where I don't find smoking as enjoyable as I used to.  I never intended to smoke as much as I do, but addiction happened.  I have cut back drastically from two packs a week to about two packs a month.  I have gotten to the point where I don't smoke daily, but I still smoke occasionally

My boyfriend smokes as well.  I know he has cut back since I have started dating him from maybe half a pack to a 2-3 a day usually less if I spend the weekend with him.

As dumb as it sounds I like smoking with him, I know its a stupid habit, and a poor decision, but when I am around him its hard to resist smoking with him.  He doesn't pressure me into smoking though.

He does say he plans on quitting at some point down the road, but has never made a firm commitment towards it.   

We do have solid chemistry, and I do love him.  I wouldn't leave him over him smoking since I am guilty of the same thing and that would just make me a hypocrite.  I do want him to quit with me though, but I don't want to pressure him to quit if he truly wants to.  I want him to quit for himself and not base it on my desires (I do feel a contradicted because part of its selfish and part of it is that I care about him).  I want to be encouraging, but I don't know exactly how to bring up the subject gently.

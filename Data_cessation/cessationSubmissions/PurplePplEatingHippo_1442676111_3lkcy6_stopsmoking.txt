Day 3.

Well, woke up this morning and for the first time in 5 years, I didn't cough, nor did I feel like a smoke as soon as I woke up. Took awhile for the craving to come but it wasn't as strong as yesterday, yesterday was a struggle the fiend was real. Fiending so hard I could taste it, getting antsy, telling myself just one.


Well thanks to the cool cats on Reddit, and the people I have in my life atm I managed to stick it out and not even touch one. It was exciting to say the least. I feel, taking this wonderful journey one day at a time is what's needed.
My next goal. Going to the bar with friends tonight. So tmrw this time. Smoke free. 


Shout out to everyone else trying to quit. It isn't easy, the fiend is real, one of the hardest things you can do, but the end result is what makes it all worth it. Keep at it.

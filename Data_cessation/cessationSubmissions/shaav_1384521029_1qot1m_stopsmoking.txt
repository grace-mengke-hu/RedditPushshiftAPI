180 days! 6 months! I'm so happy! :D

I consider myself a nonsmoker now. :) The last few months I considered myself a smoker who quit, but now I have the confidence to say that I'm a nonsmoker!

Keep it up, friends! Life without cigarettes is so so so much better! :) And thank you for being there for me, this subreddit has helped me so much! :D 

You people are awesome!

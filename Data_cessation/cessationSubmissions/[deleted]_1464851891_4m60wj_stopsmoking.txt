Four weeks!

Man, these last three weeks have flown by!

The first week was relatively tough (although I have become a bit used to the first week after multiple quitting attempts). I was counting the hours in the first three days and counting the days in the first week or so.

But since day 10 and onwards, it has been relatively easy and I have been feeling progressively better ever since.

Quitting smoking is so worth it!

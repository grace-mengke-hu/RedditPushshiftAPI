72 Hours

Made it through my first 72 hours as of 30 mins ago. Was going to quit at new years but with college assignments and exams starting on the second and going on for two weeks had to wait till they were over. Ah well its done now and I have to say reading your guys stories on here was an inspiration so thank you

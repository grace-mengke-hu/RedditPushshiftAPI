40 days

Damn it has been 40 days already, I remember when I used to get a bit jealous seeing other people quitting for similar amounts of time, I thought I would never make it that long.

I'm definitely comfortable about not smoking almost all the time. I still get cravings sometimes but at the same time I find smoking disgusting (really hard to explain, weird how sometimes I crave something that now seems disgusting to me, the thought of smoking makes me a bit sick)

I also don't miss smoking anymore. I thought I will for rest of my life but I suppose that was just addiction speaking.

Thank you for all the support during those 40 days. First 2 weeks very insanely hard. the third week was kinda average. Things got rather easy after month.

I want to stop this before it becomes a problem

I'm 17, and most of my friends that I hang around with are active smokers, and when we hang out I tend to smoke 3-5 cigarettes at a time, not including cigars. Now they all could care less about how bad it is, Hell, some even brag about how cool it makes then seem, but I always feel like crap after smoking one, no matter how good that it feels at first. Well I haven't hung out with them for the last month (They're mainly all losers and deadbeats anyway) but I still sneak in the occasional cigarillo or cigarette from my parents. Last week after I was done smoking a cigarillo I promised myself that this was it, that I don't need this crap, yet this weekend I smoked one cigarette , and today I took a couple drags of another before putting it out due to sheer shame for myself. I have an addictive personality, and so I already feel myself having slight cravings (like this weekend) how could I stop this before it becomes a serious problem? How long will it take to get all of this junk out of my body? Thank you in advance.

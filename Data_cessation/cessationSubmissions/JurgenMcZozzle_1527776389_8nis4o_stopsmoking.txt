feeling really depressed

i've read that the depression is temporary, but how temporary? every single nerve in my body craves for a ciggie, my own brain trains to convince me that its not so bad and that im missing out.
how long will this last? I just wanna know its not that long.
also, if I smoke an occasional ciggie every couple of days or hookah will it slow this process?
last time I managed to go a full month I was still craving pretty bad.

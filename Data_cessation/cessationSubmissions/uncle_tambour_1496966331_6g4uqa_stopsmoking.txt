Does anyone else get smoking dreams?

I'm a year and change quit, and it's easily the best decision I've made in a very long time, but lately I notice that I've been having dreams where I smoke. Initially it was just dreams of me smoking, and now they're starting to develop like plot and motivation for dream-me to light up a cigarette. Is this a thing that happens to other people, or is my brain just trying to kill me in new and creative ways?

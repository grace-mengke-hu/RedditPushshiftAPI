Care to share your dreams with NRT?

Had my last smoke on Thursday morning, started the patch and am on my third full day without cigarettes. I'd been pack-a-day for about five years, smoking for 13, and had failed cold turkey and e-cigs several times. I understand that I'll still have to deal with the nicotine in a couple months, but for now breaking all of these psychological links and physical habits makes sense to me. And I already feel great; I have a lot more energy, my mind seems somewhat more focused as my body has its damn nic and isn't forcing my mind into these constant little loops.

Anyway, I'd heard of people having intense dreams while on the patch, and wondered if anybody might want to share theirs specifically or offer any advice for dealing with them. 

Personally, my dreams are very vivid to begin with, and I haven't noticed any severe differences. I've also been smoking more pot than normal the past few days, so that certainly has something to do with it. Last night I did have a dream where my front teeth got knocked out, which is something I get sometimes and seems to be stress related. But the "icky" feeling when I awoke passed very quickly, more than I can recall from the past.

Have a beautiful day!

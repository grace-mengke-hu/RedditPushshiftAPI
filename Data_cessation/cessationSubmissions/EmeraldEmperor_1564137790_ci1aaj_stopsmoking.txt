Addicted already after 2 months

As I'm typing this, my burning urge to smoke a cigarette has made me realise how I've made things worse for myself by starting to smoke 2 months ago due to work and personal stress. 

I still remember that first puff while on lunch break with a colleague -- the immense cathartic feeling I got kinda surprised me. From then on, I smoked 1-2 a day which eventually turned into 6-7. I should note that the urge to smoke is only there during work, so I do not smoke during the weekends. Perhaps the poor relationship with my boss coupled with being delegated monotonous, unsatisfactory tasks every working day is the trigger. 

I've just started using a vape but it's nowhere near the same feeling.  Even though smoking is sabotaging one my main goals right now, which is to build more muscle, I still don't *really* want to quit. My linear progression in the gym has stalled. In fact, I'm now getting weaker with every gym session for about 2 weeks now. That should've been my wake-up call but goddammit I still want to smoke.

Constant rumination of my loneliness, work stress and poor social skills isn't helping. I'm only fucking 23. I can't keep doing this to myself for fuck sake.

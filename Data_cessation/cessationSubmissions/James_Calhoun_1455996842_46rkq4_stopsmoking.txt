Anyone else here also experienced that the second month is really more difficult mentally than the first month?

Good evening!

So I've quit smoking a few times in the past, some attempts were a few days and some attempts a few weeks. In my experience the first month is more physically challenging, because you have to endure the common withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine cessation like feeling a bit depressed or suffering from insomnia.

The weird thing for me, though, is that its actually getting harder in the second month. Its more of a mental game now. I don't have any physical withdrawl symptoms anymore, but my mind keeps nagging me for that precious cigarette, which will ultimately lead me back to being a pack-a-day-smoker. I've read Allen Carr's EasyWay and watched the video also, so intellectually I know that cigarettes do not give me anything, on the contrary, they only suck the life out of you. But still, the nagging for a cigarette persists. The longest I've gone without nicotine since I've been a smoker is 42 days, so I'm almost passed that milestone. 
I'm curious whether (long term) quitters know what I'm going through and I hope they can provide some insight for me.

Take care.

Crazy Symptoms, Day 5

Hey all, I'm on my 5th day. In some ways I feel pretty good and in others I feel like i'm dying.

Cravings are awful, was wondering when the tightness in the chest goes away? I know part of it is healing i'm sure part is anxiety (I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder) but it's stressing me out to feel like there's a hand gripping my heart. 

Also I have so much energy I feel like i'm on Meth. I was excited to have some more energy but I feel like I have TOO much. I'm not seeing anyone else with this problem so i'm a bit worried now. I'm hyper active, can't stop talking on and on, I've been going to the gym to burn some of it off but it only helps for an hour or so. Has anyone else been this hyper? All I can think to do to ease it is I take a hit of pot when I get home (my bf smokes but I don't) it has been helping calm me down though. 

Just to clarify, i'm not panicking. I'm in a good mood-ish. Maybe a little anxious but mostly positive. I just can't stop feeling like i'm on speed. My eyes are huge and I can't stop running my mouth (though I can't focus on work either). Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Thanks!

I want to quit, but every time I smoke my "last" cigarette, I can only go a day without giving in and buying a pack.

I've been smoking on and off for the past 6 years of my life. The first time I quit was three years ago, and I was able to stay that way for most of two years. I had a couple cigarettes during that two year mark, but never really got addicted again. I could go weeks, even months without a cigarette. Then I started smoking full time again a little over a year ago. I attempted to quit a few months ago, and that only lasted two weeks before I have into my craving. My friends keep trying to help me quit, and my boyfriend is being really supportive of me. He hates cigarettes, hates the smell of them on me, and wants me to quit, but he isn't pushing the matter. I made a deal with him about a week ago so he can try to help me quit. Every time he sees me smoking a cigarette, he can take one cigarette from my pack and break it up and throw it away. I can honestly say the first pack didn't phase me much, but the second pack, I really cut back on smoking. What's the point of buying a pack when only half the pack is going to get smoked. That's just me wasting my money. That's another thing too, I'm tired of wasting money on these nasty little life suckers. I need help. Everything I'm doing isn't working. Please, any advice Reddit? I can't keep living my life like this. I want to quit and I want to live a long and healthy life, smoke free!

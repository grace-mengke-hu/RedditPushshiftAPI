Getting a head start

Been off the stinkies for almost 8 months. Still had the nicotine monkey on my back tho. I said I'd quit after this semester and got 2 weeks left. I'm sick of it - quitting today to get a head start. Just went for a run and feelin good cleaning up my room - good luck everyone.

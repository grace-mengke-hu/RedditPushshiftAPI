A Little get together.

So there was a lil get together at my house yesterday.  Two ppl smoked there it really didnt bother me but i notices.  Today is when the craving hit.  There was a pack of newports laying around that some forgot. I saw them and tho.  mhm who would know?  Then i remember i'd know and how much more id smoke and money i would spend getting hooked again.  So i fought off the urge.  It hit me hard,  haven't had a strong urge like that in a while now.  For ppl starting to quite or thinking of quitting read allen carr's easy way to quite smoking.  O yea this is a good song too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZaEUK7Jys&list=LLhUw71f78YSN-VRNr4SyP7A

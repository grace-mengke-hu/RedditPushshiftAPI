People are real jerks to smokers (anyone know anything about smoking tests?)

I've been smokefree for 96 hours now, and will be for another two days at least (trying to set milestones of "I'll quit for a week!" and then reassessing how I feel and what's next, rather than "I'm quitting forever!" which is a goal I'll clearly fail eventually). I just realized while grappling with withdrawal that nicotine addiction is the one addiction that's socially acceptable to just be completely passive-aggressive about. If someone has a meth addiction you're not a jerk to that person- you wait until they want to get better and then support them, rather than nag them about it.

I need to pass a smoking test soon. I'll have been smokefree for 5 1/2 days,  and I only smoked a maximum of five cigarettes a day this year; sometimes it was only 2-3. Can anyone give me any approximations as to whether I'll pass? I don't know any details about the test itself

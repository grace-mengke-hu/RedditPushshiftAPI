I want to stop but I'm anxious

Hi guys,

I really need your help. I want to stop smoking on september 5th but I'm really nervous about it. I tried to stop on July 1st but I failed because my brain was going crazy and it was telling me how much I loved smoking and how nice it is, etc, etc.

I want to try again next monday because I'm tired of it and it costs me way too much each month (my bf will be able to work part time instead of full time if we succesfully stop smoking).

So do you guys have any advice on how to deal with my brain telling me how much I love it?

Also, do you guys have advice on how to quit when you're a student (master degree). I'm always at home working on my thesis and I smoke a lot because of that. Everytime I read or work I smoke a shit load of cig. I'm also in a stressful time - my master degree is really not going that well- and I feel that I've developed a social anxiety through time (because I'm always alone at home) and I feel anxious when I get out of the house (if I meet friends or if I try to go out to study, etc) so I don't tend to go outside a lot.... Is anyone in a similar situation have some advice for me?

Sorry for bad english - not my first language.

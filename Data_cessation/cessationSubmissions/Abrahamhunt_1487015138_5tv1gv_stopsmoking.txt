Want to take the stop smoking seriously this time.

I have been smoking for over 10 years and in that meantime I have become a heavy smoker. It had a lot to do with being depressed and stressed in the meantime that pushed me to smoke more and more. I have tried to stop smoking previously but never took it religiously. Have tried nicotine patches, gum, pills and even the one where I push myself not to go out the house until most shops are closed so it would have been too far to get it. (backfired badly as I would not be able to sleep all night and be the first customer in the morning buying a pack, didn't have a car so it made sense). I smoke more than a pack a day (20 pack) and it's just really hard to stop, the worst part is when I wake up, I crave a cig or a rolly so bad that I have to smoke within 5-10 mins of waking up or I cannot function normally. I have been saying that I want to stop smoking for over 2 years now and there has not been a day in those 2 years that I have not smoked. But I have finally decided to take this seriously and basically fight my own mind, if you can call it that. After this post I will smoke my last cigarette (there have been dozens of "last one" in the past couple of years). But this time it feels different, I feel that I can do it and stop forever. I have been looking through stop smoking tips and quotes etc. I have decided to stop it in one go "cold turkey" as other method have not been effective at all for me. I stumbled on this sub while looking for ideas to stop smoking and have been reading some post which really inspired me to go through with it. Sorry for the long rant but the way I see it, it's a testimony for how I feel at this very moment and I can always come back to reflect on how I currently feel and how badly I want to go through with this.

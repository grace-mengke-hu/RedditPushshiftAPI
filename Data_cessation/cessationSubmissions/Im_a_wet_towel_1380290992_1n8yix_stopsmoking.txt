Day 4, some musings.

So Monday was the last day I smoked. Tuesday I wore a 21mg patch, and stopped wearing it on Wednesday. Here it is Friday morning. Yesterday was the worst so far. Between the anxiety, and the head games that I played on myself, I almost didn't make it. I will tell you this, the fact that I DID make it is an amazing morale booster. I feel better this morning, I mean I still feel the withdrawal, but not desperate. 

I wish that I could tell you that I did it myself, but my SO has been amazing. She never pressured me into quitting, or even asked, but I knew she wanted me to. I knew that I wouldn't be successful until I was ready though, and I think that she knew that as well. Now that I am quitting though, she is very supportive. When I start to fall into the deep cravings she talks to me, and gets me to think about something else. Its amazing how well she does it. 


Back on point though. If I can do this, trust me when I say that you can as well. You HAVE to want it though. No one can pressure you into it. It just won't work. The will has to be internal. We all know how bad cigarettes are, how damaging they are, no one can tell you something that you don't already consider. Ultimatums never work. 

Really not sure what my point is here...my head is racing, my body is urging me do harm it... It's going to pass.

I decided to quit! Read Allen Carr's book but still feel afraid! Good luck for me! :)

I am currently a Non Smoker. I smoked my last cigarette one hour ago just after I finished Allen Carr's book.
I felt fear and I still didn't feel that joy he mentions in the book. Maybe I read it wrong? lol
I am not trying to quit, I have already quit! I will read the book again to enforce what I already read!

Any suggestions?

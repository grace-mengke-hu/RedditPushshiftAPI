Quit cold turkey or use the patch?

Hey all 28 year old male here. Smoke roughly a half pack a day for the past 10 years. 

My quit date is this Friday. I've tried cold turkey a many times before and failed.

What can I expect using the patch this time around? I also have anxiety issues so I'm kind of freaked out.

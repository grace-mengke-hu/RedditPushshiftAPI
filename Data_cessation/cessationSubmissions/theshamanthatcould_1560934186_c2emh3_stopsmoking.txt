Trying again

This has got to be attempt 100 but I'm going to give it a shot. My lozenges are in my roommate's car.  A little while ago I made it to day 4, and I think I'm really tired of smoking still.

I keep thinking about how I want to quit so bad. I quit for 8 months years ago and it drives me up the wall that it's been four years. I detest smoking now, everything involving nicotine. It's crazy how you can hate a drug so lethally yet all it takes is a few minutes to fall right back into the hole. I keep thinking, when will it stop? Will I do this until I die? Maybe I should be buried with a pack of cigarettes sitting on my grave just so, maybe, I can keep fighting into my afterlife /s (lol) No I say that because my mate's step dad says he wants to be buried with a pack of cigarettes because he is so trapped

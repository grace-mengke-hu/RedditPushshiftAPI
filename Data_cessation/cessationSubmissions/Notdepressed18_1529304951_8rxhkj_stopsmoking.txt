Advice I can give my dad?

He started nicotine patches yesterday as well as gum and hasn't smoked since,  but he's been a pack a day smoker for around 40 years and im fearful for him to replase as he's attempted quitting in the past and never lasts long. But his health is declining very fast from all the cigarettes and he's developed COPD and had a few cancer scares so we are really looking for long term answers to ensure him living as long as possible. I know patches aren't exactly a complete solution but he's having a hard time finding his willpower and inner strengths to stop nicotine intake for good. He doesn't think he will be strong enough. This is my first time here, I guess I'm just looking for any advice you can throw at me, all will be greatly appreciated! :) thank you.

2 weeks, all thanks to YOU guys (and gals!)

This is my first few hours: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2yep77/the_day_has_come/

 

I've come a LONG way imo! If someone had asked me if I would have quit smoking, I would have told them hell no! Here we are!! 

 

I usually come here a few times a day to help stay on track. First week was cold turkey, second week I've been using 0mg nicotine (just flavor) e-cigs to help with the cravings.

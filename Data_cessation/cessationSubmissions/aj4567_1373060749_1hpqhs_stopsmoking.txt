Hyperinflated lungs (xpost with /r/health)

Ok, I'm not asking for medical advice on here, but I am asking for peace of mind. I went to the doctor today to get a physical. I'm 30F. On again/ off again smoker for 13 years, never a really heavy smoker. The most was maybe 1/2 pack a day. Now I'm a social smoker and maybe smoke a pack a week (and now I'm totally done). 
I told the doctor I'd been having some stabbing pains in my ribcage intermittently for the past couple weeks. Most likely it's gas or something, it's not in the same place and it's quick to come and go. I'm about to get bumped off my insurance, though, and so she agreed to do a chest x-ray. I got the results (via a message through the patient portal thing, very brief and I disliked that I couldn't ask questions). They said my lungs were clear but hyperinflated. I don't know how badly they are hyperinflated. The doctor said she wanted me to do a lung function test to make sure I don't have a lung disease.
Of course I started googling around and freaking myself out that I have COPD or emphysema. I am not in great shape, but I am not out of breath, don't have trouble breathing, asthma, or coughing, and am able to jog 2 miles with my dog everyday without my wind being too bad.
I read online that sometimes the xrays are just misread, or it could be caused by anxiety (which I definitely have, and I am also going through a really rough divorce/move/life change).
Has anyone else had this diagnosis and it turned out ok? Like I said, I'm not looking for medical advice, and I have already scheduled my lung function test for Monday- I just need some comforting words to get through the weekend.

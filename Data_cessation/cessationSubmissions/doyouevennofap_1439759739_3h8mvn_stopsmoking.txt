Parttime smoker ...

Hey reddit, 

I am here to ask you for some advice. Almost 4 years passed since my first attempt to stop smoking and still no victory. My problem (I know it sounds stupid) is that I don´t seem to be addicted to nicotine. I only smoke in social situations or when I drink alcohol. I can go months without a cigarette with no problem but as soon as I am out with some other smokers or I drink my first beer the urge to smoke is so unbearable I just give in (and I tell myself: how bad is it to smoke every then and now). Well the problem is that it´s not just a couple of cigarettes but I smoke away a pack or two. 

And the next day I feel like I am about to die. I know even though I am not a regular smoker it fucks up my health to binge smoke a few packs every weekend (especially now in summer where there are more social events). How did you manage to stay in full control when around smokers and when drinking alcohol? And I tried to not drink alcohol for months but honestly I dont want to give up this few beers now and then with my friends while going out ...

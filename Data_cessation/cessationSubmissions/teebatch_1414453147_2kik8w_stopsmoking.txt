Tomorrow marks one week!

I just wanted to tell everyone that you CAN quit. I didn't think I could, but look at me now. One week without a cigarette, and I'm asking myself why I didn't do this sooner. No stinky clothes. No bad breath. No chest pains. And best of all, there's no dependence anymore!

To anyone thinking they can't quit, **you're wrong.**

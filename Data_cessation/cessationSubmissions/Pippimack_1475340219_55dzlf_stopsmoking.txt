One month and I don't want a cigarette. I want a cigar.

I used to smoke around a pack a day and always wanted to stop. So when I kicked cigarettes it was a real relief. I don't want to go back. 

However I used to really enjoy the occasional cigar.

When I quit I knew cigars were out of the question too... but I still really want one. Thing is, I suspect that if I have one it'll lead me right back to cigarettes.

Does anyone here enjoy an occasional cigar? It's just so hard to accept I'll never be able to have another one when it was in fact the cigarettes that I quit. 

Next weekend I have an event that I know I'll want to smoke a cigar at... and I just don't know how I'll resist.

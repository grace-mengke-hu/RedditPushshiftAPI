Hello, from the other side

I don't think about smoking anymore, but this subreddit popped up on my front page so I thought I'd drop by.

I quit 549 days ago apparently. I probably stopped caring about smoking about 200 days ago.

I've saved $6500 since quitting and I've avoided smoking 10,000 cigarettes.

Come over to this side, things are way better over her.

I'm back, and I don't need to reset my badge this time.

Thanks so much to everyone on this subreddit. I was feeling pretty down about my relapsing, but after posting once and receiving some support, I've reached the first hurdle of 72 hours without as much as bumming a drag. I'm starting to feel really good, and I'm starting to feel more confident that I can continue. The cravings aren't as painful anymore, and the return of taste has been great. I've gone back to one of my loves, cooking nice meals for myself and friends.

Thanks again to those who posted on my original post and everyone who posts here on the subreddit. Now to keep it up!

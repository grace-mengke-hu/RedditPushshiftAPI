Hi guys. I am new to this sub. I am excited to discontinue smoking.

I am seriously addicted to smoking.  had my first cig when I was 12. I really started to smoke when I was 15. I am now 23 and have been considering quitting for the last few months. I put my first patch on this morning and have nicotine gum for the next week and a half. I know that I can't quit only using nicotine replacement, but since I have the patches and gum I will use them. 

Do any of you know any strategies that will help me for my first week?

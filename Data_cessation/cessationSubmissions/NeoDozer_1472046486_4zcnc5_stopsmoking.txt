It gets better!!

I passed my 1 year anniversary and didn't even realize I had until a co-worker asked me how quitting was going, yesterday.  And it was AWESOME to realize just how much less I am thinking about it.  I still get the random craving maybe once/month or maybe even every other month but it tends to be panic/emotionally distressed related, for me and not nearly as intense as they used to be.

I think that is the nature of addiction, though. When you are your emotionally weakest is when those little demons come out to play.    BUT even those cravings aren't the cold clammy sweat, tunnel vision, and shaky hands of my full blown cravings right after I quit.  These are just the seductive voice of addiction saying "Wouldn't just one make you feel better right this second?  You can handle one, just one and it will make you feel so much more in control."  And it is easier to choose to ignore when you know it is just your addiction speaking and that that a&&hole would lie to it's own mother.

So buck up new quitters! It gets better, you get smarter, and eventually you forget most of the time that quitting was even a thing!!!

I've made it 250 days

This should be a celebration, but I've never felt more miserable. It's Canadian May 24 weekend where you buy a 24 of beer and get drunk with your friends. I've partaken in this tradition for years, when I quit smoking I lost alot of people. Now I'm drunk and alone on my favorite holiday. 
I don't want any sympathy, I made my choices and I'll stick by em, but it'd be nice to hear how others have endured.

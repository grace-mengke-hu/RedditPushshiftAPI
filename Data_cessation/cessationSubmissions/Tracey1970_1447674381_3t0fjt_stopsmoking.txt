5 days smoke free for me also

It's now 5 days since my last cigarette. I am currently using the help of Champix. 
I stopped as I have Chiari Malformation. It's one thing to live with my symptoms during the day , but to be woken in the night by the symptoms pushed me over the edge and I had to do something about it. 
I'm taking it one day at a time, it's all I can do. Luckily I haven't had many cravings BUT, I'm sure they will come.

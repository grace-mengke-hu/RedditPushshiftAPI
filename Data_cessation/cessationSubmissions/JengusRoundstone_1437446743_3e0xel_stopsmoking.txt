48 hours, the cravings are really bad. When will they get easier?

My mind is playing tricks on me like hell right now.. I would almost do anything to smoke a cigarette atm (won't do it) because my mind is telling me that "It's not worth quitting if you'll always feel this bad about it".. I also heard 48 hours is the worst since the nerve endings are starting to grow again.

So when will this get better, because seriously I can't take this shit for much longer :/

EDIT: Stopped cold turkey, smoked a pack a day for 6 years. 
EDITEDIT: Thank you for all your support guys!!

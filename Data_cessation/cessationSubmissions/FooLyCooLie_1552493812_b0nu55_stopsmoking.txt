6 days

I had been a smoker for almost ten years. It's been six days since I've had my last *actual* cigarette. I have been sneaking off mixed bowls its here and there on my glass piece, but I'm trying to ween myself off the damn things.

The physical symptoms have been a lot worse then anything. I have days where I feel nauseated all day, and daily tasks make me feel as if I'm going to strain myself.

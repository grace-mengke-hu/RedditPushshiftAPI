Day 1

I started smoking 10 years ago and it has to be probably the worst decision of my life.  Now, when I think of it, cigarette controlled 10 freaking years of life.  I decided who to eat with, who to hang out with, when to go out, cigarettes after meal, looking forward to parties where I would be allowed to smoke and skipping parties where friends just watched movies.  I have tried quitting many times before and I have always failed.  One of the reasons is because I always did it secretly.  No one to hold me accountable for.  Last night, I broke all the remaining cigarettes and put them in trash.  I vowed to never smoke again.  I am posting this on reddit because I know this group is an awesome bunch of people encouraging and sharing quit smoking stories.

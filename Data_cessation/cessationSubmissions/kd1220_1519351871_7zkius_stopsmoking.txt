Realistic vaping experiences

I’ve read a ton of posts in this sub regarding people using vaping to quit smoking and wanted to get a better understanding of people’s experiences. I’ve got a mental pros and cons list but was looking for some feedback from others regarding my specific situation so I’m going to kind of go over a pro/con list below and ask for your thoughts. I know vaping gets a lot of negativity on this sub, which I completely understand, but I feel it may be the appropriate step for me. 


I have been smoking for over 15 years, a pack a day for almost 10 of those years. 

I live with two other smokers. We do smoke in the house. I also smoke in my car. I don’t feel like being able to vape “anywhere” will affect me that much because I can smoke pretty much anywhere now. The only place I go regularly that I can’t smoke is work/restaurants with friends where I wouldn’t feel comfortable vaping inside anyways. 

It’s not really quitting- I don’t necessarily feel ready to go cold turkey, especially considering my situation. I’m not to the point where I can be in a house where people are smoking and I have the self control to abstain when cigarettes are readily available. I feel a step down method would be much more successful for me. 

Costs is another thing I’m thinking of. I don’t really know how much vaping costs besides the initial cost of a vaporizer and a bottle of juice. How long does that bottle typically last? The last thing I want to do is give up cigarettes just to pick up a more expensive habit. 

I’ve been smoking since I was 15, so it’s definitely habitual. I feel like I do better with slowly weaning myself off bad habits, but I know it ultimately comes down to will power. So please- good, bad, let me know how successful (or not) you were using vaping as NRT while quitting.

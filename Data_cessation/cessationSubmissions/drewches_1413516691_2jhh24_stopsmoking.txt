Breathing Question

So, I'm at 27 days (woo hoo!) and I have this feeling like my lungs are full. I've had the feeling before usually when I was really wanting a smoke. Anyone else had something like this?

Edit: I should probably define "full." It feels more like my lungs are full of smoke. That tight feeling you sometimes feel especially after a cigarette.

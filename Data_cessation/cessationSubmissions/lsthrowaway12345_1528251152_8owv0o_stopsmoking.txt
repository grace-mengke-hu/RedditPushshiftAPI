For my husband: Best OTC sprays, gums, tablets, etc.?

My husband is a long\-time smoker who's really struggling with withdrawal. He recently ran out of a Nicorette nicotine spray he got on Amazon, which has been his go\-to for several months (he just forgot to order more on time), and he's tried gum and patches before but didn't feel they did him any good. Looking to crowd\-source suggestions of ANYTHING that's over\-the\-counter that has helped you all so I can pass the suggestions on to him to buy to hold him over until his new spray arrives.

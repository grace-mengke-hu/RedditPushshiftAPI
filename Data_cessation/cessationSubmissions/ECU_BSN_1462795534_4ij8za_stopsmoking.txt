Today is my 1 year anniversary quit date (5/9/15)

I quit smoking a year ago today. I never ever ever ever ever thought I would say these words in my life. 

I initially tried the patch which gave my heart a dysrhythmia. So one week into this and I was cold turkey. I have had not one cigarette in a year. 

I was a very confirmed smoker. 1.5 or sometimes 2ppb. There have been times of temptation but those minutes/moments pass. 

I can actually walk upstairs and jog for periods of time without feeling like I want to pass out. I don't stink like smoke 24 seven. Most importantly I feel healthier and have more energy than I've had ....probably in my whole life. 

I started at 15 or 16 years old and quit at 39. 

Here's my thing....I view this as any other form of recovery. I cannot smoke, ever, not even one. When I have a moment where I wish I had a cigarette I distract myself, drink water, go for a walk. But those days are fewer and farther between. 

If you're thinking about quitting and the time is right for you please do. In no time at all a YEAR will have passed!

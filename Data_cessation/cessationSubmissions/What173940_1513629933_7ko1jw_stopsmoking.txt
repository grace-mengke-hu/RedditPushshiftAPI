Day 42

Hi there,

Havent been here for a while.
Just a small update on my quitting.

I've had my ups and downs this quit and I've never come this far. Its twice my record in quitting. As I've never been able to quit for more than 3 weeks though I've tried many times in the 13 years I've smoked.

So... 6 weeks now.

I'm stil doing fine. Have been out partying a couple of times and didnt even think of smoking each time.
I went through times and didnt even feel close to smoking, as it would only make me feel worse.

I experience a strange nostaglia with the smell of smoke every once in a while. But I'm able to counter that feeling. Most of the time it smells really bad.

A lot of people around me are getting inspired and quitting themselves.

Well, its time to go for my daily jog.
I didnt run for two weeks, so its time to start exercizing again.

Let me know how you're doing :)
It's nice to talk to other quitters every once in a while.

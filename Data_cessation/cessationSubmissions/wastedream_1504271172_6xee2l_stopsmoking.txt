Day 3 fatigue..

Hello, 

First of all, I'd like to thank you! This sub is an enormous inspiration for me and I can now happily say that I'm done with smoking! 

I'm already noticing the positive changes, but the fatigue is beyond manageable (my brain is kinda turned off)... How long would it last and are there any ways to fight it? I'm exercising, eating healthy and not dealing with anything stressful, but I have a very important project that I need to work on...

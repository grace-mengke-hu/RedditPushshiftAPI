I have not smoked in 5 days but have been chewing tobacco instead. Does anyone else have experience with step down methods and the next steps?

I have been smoking for a couple years now and am trying to replace smoking with chewing as a way to completely be done with tobacco eventually. Any tips or goals I should set to help achieve this?

To my friends that chew, please read.

You may not know this but they make "herbal snuff" and "mint snuff". You can usually pick some up at your local tobacco store for about the price of a can of dip, it's feels alot like the real thing but it's not. I personally recommend smokey mountain, they put cayenne pepper in it so that it burns your lip the way you would expect tobacco to. It's not quite the same, but it helps a ton (better than sunflower seeds). So, I just wanted to raise awareness that this stuff exists, and is usually pretty easy to find (if they have it out here in the middle of nowhere, they probably have it where you live too).

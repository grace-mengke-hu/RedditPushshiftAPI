It's getting easier.

In the last 185 hours, I haven't smoked 5 packs of smokes. Day three and four sucked the worst. Had a buddy over yesterday and we spend all day in the garage, wrenching, watching football, and drinking beer. There were a few moments where I had cravings, but they passed real quick. I put all my ashtrays away too. I got this, baby.

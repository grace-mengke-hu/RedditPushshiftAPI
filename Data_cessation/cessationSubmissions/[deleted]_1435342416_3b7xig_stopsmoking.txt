Bizarre and totally unexpected benefit of quitting

When I was a teenager I basically lived in punk/metal venues. The result now is horrible tinnitus. For those who don't have tinnitus (roughly 95% of people IIRC), it is no fun. Sometimes it flares up and the ringing will sound like someone is crimping paper in your ear. Other times it's just a loud, loud ring. Most of the time you can drown out the ring by will power or distractions. But other times there will be days on end where the ringing is so loud that you can't ignore it.

I can hardly believe it, but since I quit smoking my tinnitus has slowly gotten better. Honestly I have a hard time accepting that quitting nicotine has really helped, but it is undeniable. I noticed about a month into quitting that my tinnitus doesn't flare up as often, and now two months in, I honestly haven't noticed my tinnitus in a couple of weeks. 

Has anyone else experienced this effect? Is it just a coincidence?

Juuled for the past 4 years every day

I'm finally realizing that my nicotine addiction is getting overwhelming. I'm a sophomore in college and it affects me physically and mentally on a daily bases. I'm currently at about a pod a day and  I often find myself out of breath simply from walking up and down the stairs to my room. I've tried quitting for the past few months but I always end up buying another pack of pods. Can anyone share helpful tips or tricks they used get the process of quitting started more smoothly? Also how do you get the counter for days since you quit? Thanks

Question for all ex smokers... when does this shitty feeling go away?

I have felt so sick since I quit. I can't breathe through my nose it's so stuffy, my throat is scratchy, and the amount of phlegm I wake up to in my mouth is unreal. It's worse than waking up in the morning after i smoked too many cigarettes. When does it go away?

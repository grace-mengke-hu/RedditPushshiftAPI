Over a week now!

I hope you guys/gals don't count disposable e-cigs against me because I've been through 3 so far. They usually last me about 24 hours, so I've even had a couple days with no nicotine at all.

My longest quit attempt was 2 months in 2011.

26, been smoking for 7 years...trying to healthy up the body with weight loss, exercise, better eating, and of course smoking cessation. It's really kind of hard to do all at once, so for now the better eating is suffering a little bit.

Good luck to the rest of you!

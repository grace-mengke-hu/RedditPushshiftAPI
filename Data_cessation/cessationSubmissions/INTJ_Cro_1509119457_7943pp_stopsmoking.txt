2 months, no cravings but angry

It is very easy not to smoke, but very hard not to be angry. I started insulting people and act like an idiot. It's getting better when i realize how stupid my behavior was. Also got sinus infection (maybe not related to this) feel tired all the time. Mood is getting better, I was so emotional last month. Actually lost some weight, hungry all the time but stomach works faster. Hope it is worth it, stopped drinking coffee too, now it tastes like dirt.

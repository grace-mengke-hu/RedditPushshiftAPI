Day 1

So a little backstory about me. I’ve had a long history of abusing substances I’m 19 and I first started smoking cigarettes when I was thirteen years old, when I was 17 I became addicted to cocaine and alcohol for two years (I am now 180 days clean as of today) and decided to replace cigarettes with vaping at the same time. I no longer crave cocaine or alcohol, and I can say for sure that nicotine is way more addictive than cocaine based on my experience. 

Today my vape broke, and so I bought a packet of cigarettes and smoked a few. decided enough was enough and started reading Allen Carrs easy way to stop smoking and I can say it’s definitely already changed my perception of nicotine addiction and I highly recommend the book; I feel much more confident about quitting this time and I think my vape breaking happened for a reason; I was going to be addicted to nicotine for a very long while if I continued. So here I am back to square one and hopefully after all of these years of dependency I can finally be free.

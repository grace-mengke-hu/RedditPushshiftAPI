What happens regarding weight gain after quitting?

In two days, I will have made the 3 month mark in quitting cold turkey, and I have never felt healthier, however I have noticed I have gained a looooot of weight. I don't really understand WHY because I made a conscious effort to start going to the gym literally the day I quit. Which leads me to another question: can you "gain" weight or weigh more in pounds/kilos from gaining muscle instead of fat?!???! 

When I tried the scales, I actually thought they were WRONG, or broken or something, that's how much I've gained since quitting, probably 2 stone / at least a stone and a half... They weren't broken though ffs :( Admittedly I have overindulged in food at times (sometimes violently) to get through the cravings however I thought that exercise would counteract binges. Anybody know a quick way to lose your I-quit-smoking fat? It's making me want to smoke again so I'll go back to my "normal" size and people have been talkin some BS about how smoking increases your metabolism.... Say it isn't so :(

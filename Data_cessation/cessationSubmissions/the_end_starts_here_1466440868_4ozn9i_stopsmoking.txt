Summer starts tomorrow, so let's quit.

Been trying to quit for a couple of years, been trying every day of the month so far but failing every day. So let's make this one stick, starting by resetting my badge. Also quit weed on the 17th, nofap and alcohol the 18th, (although I'm not a problematic drinkers, I just want my mind to be clear for a couple of months without any substances which influence me, in order to refind myself.) and now quitting smoking today the 20th. I call it the ultra challenge, lol. Even have exams now but it won't hold me back.

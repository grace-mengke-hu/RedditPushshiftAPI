Help for an alternative to smoking? (x-post from r/askreddit)

Okay, first off I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this in. But I am looking for an alternative for my parent's cigarette smoking habit. 

I've been trying to get them to quit for years, and it really hasn't changed a thing. My mother is developing some heart problems and high blood pressure, which may not be due to the smoking, but I'm sure it doesn't help. My dad smokes roughly a pack a day, and my mom half a pack. 

My girlfriend uses vaporizer mods, because she used to smoke, and that is her nicotine fix. I was wondering what you guys think about vaporizer mods(or electronic cigarettes), as an alternative. Also, which ones to go for, and prices if possible. 

This is an electronic cigarette for those who don't know: http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/attachments/e-cigarettes-public/260112d1381382411-vaping-public-mvp_in_hand.jpg

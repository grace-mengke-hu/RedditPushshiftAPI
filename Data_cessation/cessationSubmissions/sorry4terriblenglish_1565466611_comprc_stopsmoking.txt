Finally, I made it, today I quitted smoking

Hello, first of all, i would like to introduce myself a little bit and tell you about my story with smoking.

I started smoking when I was 15 years old or so. At first, it was something I did only when I went out with some friends, but soon it became and addiction. I remember that, the first time I smoked a cigarette for relaxing was when I had a (stupid) french test next day at school. Since then, I smoked more and more, until I became conscious that I was addicted to nicotine.

There were days in which I smoked a lot, other days not so much, but it was a routine. I reached a point in which I smoked a pack of cigarettes per day (usually 20). But I knew it wasn't something I should be doing, and I started counting the cigarettes I smoked daily. Then I gradually reduced the quantity. For the last year I have been smoking around 4 cigarettes per day. It may seem a lot now, but at that moment, I felt I was going the right way.

Then summer came, and as I don't have that much stress compared to the stress I have during the scholar course, I thought it was the right moment to finally quit smoking.

For the last month I have been smoking around two cigarettes per day. Not anymore. Today I smoked my last cigarette and I don't feel like smoking anymore. I know I have reduced a lot my nicotine addiction. But I still have some cravings.

It isn't going to be easy, but if some people have given up smoking, I can too! I'll keep you updated if you want. Thank you for reading :)

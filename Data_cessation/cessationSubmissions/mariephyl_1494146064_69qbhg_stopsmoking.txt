Women who quit smoking when pregnant and haven't started again

I just found out I'm pregnant, haven't had a cigarette in over a week. I'm feeling so nauseous that the thought is disgusting. I hear and know of so many people who quit while they were pregnant but took it back up again. I want to hear from anyone who stopped because of their pregnancy and has NOT taken it up again. Did you have cravings? I'd love to hear it keeps being easy, of course! I always said I'll quit at 30 or pregnant, whatever happens first. Well this has happened first. It seems like a wonderful opportunity to quit!

Finally going to do this (quitting smoking is easy I've done it a million times!)

So I've been on this sub for a few months now, and have had several quitting attempts. By best streak was 2 weeks with only 1 cigarette in between but then I started again. How do you find the balance between forgiving yourself (i.e. not giving up quitting after one drunken cigarette) and still being strict enough on yourself to commit to quitting? Wish me luck!

3 smokes left and i want to quit.

I don't know what to say, i've been smoking for about 2 years now and every time i tried i failed miserably after 2 or 3 days... How did you guys make it ? It just feels impossible to me, just thinking of never smoking again gives me anxiety, but i have to stop. I want and i need to stop.

How can i put all the chances on my side ? I've tapered down to 3-4 cigs a day now and i want to do it cold turkey once my pack is done. 

I think i'm posting this to make it kind of official to me that im quitting for good. Anyway wish me luck and i'd be happy to hear your tips

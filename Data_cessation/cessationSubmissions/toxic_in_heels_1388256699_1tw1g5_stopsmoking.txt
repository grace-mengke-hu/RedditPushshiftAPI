One year free!

Well I guess that's that.
Oh what a year it has been! I guess I'm supposed to write about how I did it: I used the "sick method" I came down with a bug and was bed ridden for two days. After not smoking for those days I thought "ok let's see how far we can go", also I read "the book" and took what I needed from it. I was constantly checking my Cessation Nation app and this awesome sub. My advice? Just keep fucking going. The cravings don't last very long and when you're out of the craving fog you'll realize that you have the strength to do power through. I'm not going to say it was a cakewalk, I smoked almost a pack a day for 21yrs and I had my moments; learning how to drive again without smoking (I realized that I started smoking before I got my license) was the hardest thing, but I just fucking did it because I was tired of huffing and puffing after climbing a flight of steps. 

I can breathe so much better and I smell like a girl not an ashtray! I'm around for anyone who needs any help.

My crazy stats, as of 1:50EST:
money saved: $1998.22
not smoked: 5474

One Week!

Honestly, this has been a much easier week than I thought it would be. I was a regular smoker of Marlboro Blacks, about six or seven a day. When I decided to quit, I knew by smoking blacks it would be difficult to quit cold turkey. So After that last pack of blacks, I went down to reds, to golds, to eventually silvers. I continued to smoke the normal amount of cigs a day, just less and less nic. Eventually I ran out of cigs in my silver pack and just like that I quit. I havent craved at all. So freeing!!!!

Thanks everyone, your support has been inspiring and helped tremendously!

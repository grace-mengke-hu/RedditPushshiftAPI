I quit smoking 2 weeks ago and it feels like I have food stuck in my throat.

There are a lot of posts about this, but I kind of just want to hear from people myself and be able to respond.

This lump that I am feeling feels so much like food food in my throat. I don't feel like coughing will get it out, but it feels like swallowing will. I have had this lump for about 3 days now and it won't go away so I know it's not food.

Should I be concerned?

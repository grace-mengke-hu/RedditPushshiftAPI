Never again

So I haven't had a cigarette in two weeks. I know some of you may say I'm not out of the woods yet but I am. Now that I haven't been smoking, I can smell how God awful they are. It literally smells like poop and I hate it. I can smell a smoker from 5 feet away and it is so fucking gross. I never realized how really terrible it makes you stink. I am so turned off from even being around people smoking. I just wanted to post this so maybe some people who are having a hard time will take into account your horrible stench and that it makes you smell like you constantly have Shit in your pants.

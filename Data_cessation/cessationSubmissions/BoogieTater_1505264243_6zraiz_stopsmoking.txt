Driving and Smokin'

Today i went out to the gas station to get some ice and cell service, by myself, a VERY rare occurrence. We have had a stressful few days, lost power from Tropical Storm Irma, no cell service, lost most of our cold food, the baby has been going out of his mind as well probably from being bored like us.  

Anyways, I was way over it, upset, and I asked my DH for a cigarette before I left and he said "after all this time you're going to puss out of quitting" but I still took it and I left. I drove all the way there and all the way back and I did not smoke it! I use to HAVE to smoke everytime i went somewhere (without baby of course). 

His words rang true, I came back in and handed it back to him and said "I'm not a puss" lol 

IT FELT GREAT! I knew it wasn't going to change my stress, I knew it would taste like shit, and I knew I'd be disappointed in myself. Anyways just needed to brag! Hang strong my fellow quitters you can do it!

Going into Day 3, feeling pretty good.

I'm starting day 3 and I feel great. I know this is probably the calm before the storm, but I'm not thinking like that. I haven't really had any cravings yet either. I've tried a few times before, but I think I did it right this time. Now hopefully my boyfriend follows suit!

Advice

Hi!

I'm going to attempt quitting tomorrow. I have been a smoker for a little over a decade, with the exception of the 40 weeks I was pregnant. 

Stress and withdrawal seem to be my biggest issues. 

I foolishly started smoking again, after I had my son. I really want to quit for him, my husband, and my health. 

My husband is a smoker, as well, and is going to quit with me. 

I'm looking for any helpful advice from people who have successfully quit. Anecdotes are welcome, as well. 

Thank you! :)

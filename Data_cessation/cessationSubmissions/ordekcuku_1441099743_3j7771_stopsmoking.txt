So, i stopped smoking.

And it's been 6 days since my last cigarette. I have a drinking problem as well and i'm staying sober too. Long story short, my libido is high as ****. I have random boners throughout the day and all of the women seem extremely beautiful and attractive. I'm happily married and have an active sex life but the last week it was far from enough. 

So, am i complaining? No way, feeling like 16 again is great (i'm 34M btw).

It's so awesome to get a non-smoking hotel room.

I went from Wisconsin to California to visit my SO for the holidays, and his family doesn't allow smoking of any kind so I was forced to quit for a week. This jump-start pushed me in the right direction; it was just what I needed to quit. I got a hotel with him while I was there for just one of the 6 nights, and it was so awesome to get a nonsmoking room with him. It was my fourth night not smoking, and I had zero cravings whatsoever. I had smoked a pack a day for nearly 5 years, which is a small number I know, but still it sucked the first couple days...My lungs hurt like hell while they're cleaning out, but still TA-DA!!! SMOKE FREE BABY!!

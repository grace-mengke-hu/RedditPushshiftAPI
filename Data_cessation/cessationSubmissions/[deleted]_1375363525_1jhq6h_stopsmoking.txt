63 days, 2 hours and 38 minutes ago.

That was when I had my last cigarette. I'm feeling some serious lung tightness, but all is well otherwise. I've dropped 31 pounds from running and lifting, and just wanted to tell you guys that where there is a will there is a way. The first three days I tried nicotine gum. It made me sick, so I just kind of cold turkey'd things. 
I used to smoke a pack a day or more from the age of 17 to 25. 
After a few of my runs I've coughed up dried blood, which is scary. 
I don't think I'm sick, but rather this is a symptom of recovery. 

Don't get discouraged if it's hard, and don't say, "This is too stressful. I need a cigarette" when things are going bad. I literally had a fresh pack ready to be smoked when my grandmother nearly passed away that I had to force myself to throw out. I twirled the little white stick in my hand for about two hours before I finally could let it go.
 I'm running three miles a day already. I was 242 lbs when I quit, and am getting lower every week. 211 as of this morning.

So, if you think, "I want to quit smoking", I recommend just tackling it head on. You'll feel great about the decision, despite how agonizing it can be. The trick I've learned is to not acknowledge the urges. I just don't have time for that shit.

Why do people relapse after so long?

So I've just hit 3 weeks. I was using NRT for the first 7 days, then just binned it and went cold turkey. I've attempted quitting several times before with e-cigs, patches, gum and always failed within a week. I don't know why, but this time without any planning or anything, I felt like I sailed through these 3 weeks with only the odd hard craving. I've smoked for 11 years, 20 a day for most of that.

I was wondering, I see people having relapses after 30 days or even 100 days. How does this happen? What should I be looking out for?

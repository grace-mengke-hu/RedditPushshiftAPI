Knowing you can, slipping and restart

So how did I feel.. I realised I liked the smoke free life, I liked how I felt how I smelt. When I slipped, I felt guilty cross disappointed, but with the help of family and here, I shook those feelings off and focused on the positive, yet still my head would not get back in gear.. So how did I get there initially.. I read stuff, focused on what I wanted, why, how I'd feel.. I set a date twn days in the future, in fact it was more than that, but I had a very clear stop date.. So that's what I'm doing this time, I see quit 4 life lady this eve, but do I wish I hadn't given in to nico? You bet!! But I've told myself off, I've cried, and now that's past, I can't change that, but I can change where I go now, and I'm heading back to freedom from nico and my life being mine %)

I cracked today

I quit September 17th 2012, and didn't have a single smoke after smoking a pack and a half a day for 13 years. Today I cracked and had three because of some shit situations that came up. Normally, I handled high stress like a champ and didn't even think about it, but things piled up on top of each other and they were available. I had 3 cigarettes. I'm just venting because I'm scared I'll start up again...help.

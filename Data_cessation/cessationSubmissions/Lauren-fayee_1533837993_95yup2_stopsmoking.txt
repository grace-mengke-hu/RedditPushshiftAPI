[Academic research] MSc project - differences in mood across ex-smokers, current smokers, vapers and non-smokers. **ex-smokers (6 months+) if you are interested in my research please feel free to complete**

I am currently conducting my Psychology masters research project and I am in need of participants! This research will require you to complete a series of questionnaires online, which will take no longer than 15 minutes. This research project is looking at the differences in mood across current smokers, vapers, ex-smokers and non-smokers.

If you are over 18 and fit into one of the below categories, then please follow the link to take part in my research study. 

\- Current smoker (must smoke at least 5 cigarettes a day &amp; have been smoking for at least 1 year)  
\- Vapers (no longer smoking cigarettes and using vaping as a method to quit smoking)  
\- Ex-smoker (must have quit smoking for at least 6 months and smoked 5 or more a day before quitting)  
\- Non-smoker (have not smoked more than 20 cigarettes in your lifetime)

If you have any queries about the research or you would like any more information, then please do not hesitate to send me a message. Thank you in advance for taking part in this research!

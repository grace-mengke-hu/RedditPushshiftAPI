Quitting today. Any advice to control weight gain?

I've decided to quit smoking. I'm tired of coughing and phlegm. Hopefully i can repair some of damage i've done to my lungs. I quit once before and when I did I gained about 40lbs. I broke up with my ex and picked up a pack to help deal with the stress and continued for 3 years. I've been wanting to quit but the combination of addiction and fear that I will gain weight again has been holding me back. Any advice on how to quit smoking and keep the weight off?

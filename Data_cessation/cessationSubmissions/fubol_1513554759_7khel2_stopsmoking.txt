Quitting vaping?

I hope this is the right community but it seems to be the best bet since there’s no /r/stopvaping! I’ve never smoked regularly (aside from a few cigarettes bummed off friends), but I have been addicted to nicotine for about 6 months due to me stupidly buying a juul to fit in with the trends. I was recently informed of some medical reasons that might make nicotine affect me more negatively than most, and decided it would probably be best to stop.

I tried cold turkey for a few days and it wasn’t that hard, but I quickly lost motivation and went back. For me, the physical cravings weren’t that bad, it was more of the routine of vaping that kept bugging me. Hitting my weed vape helped a lot, but obviously I don’t want to be high 24/7 so I can’t always use that.

So I was wondering from anyone who has quit or tried to quit vaping: would it be worth buying a Suorin with 0mg nicotine juice to maintain the routine of vaping while still going “cold turkey” from nicotine? Or will that lead to additional problems that a full quit wouldn’t create?

I know I could taper nic levels but I’d rather get it over with quickly, so I’m kinda set on a 0 nicotine path forward. I’m also aware of the dangers of inhaling any particulate, and I do eventually intend to stop vaping altogether, but my immediate medical need is to stop nicotine. So I’m just wondering if anyone has tried going straight to 0mg juice and if it’s easier than no vaping at all.

Thanks!!

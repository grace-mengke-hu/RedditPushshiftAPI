Finally quit smoking weed + tobacco out of a bong

Okay going to keep it nice, short and simple here. I was very addicted to smoking poppers/batch bowls/whatever else people call them (basically 50% tobacco in my bowl, topped off with 50% green) and smoked them out of a glass bong for about 3 1/2 years. I just quit a little while back and have been going strong for the past couple of weeks! Will be hitting 4 weeks of no weed OR tobacco tomorrow :)!

What really helped me was realizing that I can actually still get high without the tobacco. I know it's harsh as fuck which is why I ended up getting a vaporizer. I tried my hardest not to smoke for a couple days and to fight/resist every urge I got. Then I would smoke (just weed) at the very end of the night with my vaporizer and I would get pretty stoned. Did that for about a week and thought hey fuck it if I can stop the tobacco I can stop the weed. Now I'm just trying to see how long I can go without smoking at all haha.

Just curious though, I use to spit/cough out black stuff (probably tar from the tobacco) but since I've quit it has reduced by a lot. The first week or so after quitting was pretty bad, I was coughing it all out and am assuming it was just me clearing out my lungs. But the last week and a half or so it hasn't been as much and I've noticed quite an improvement. Just wondering how long I should expect to keep coughing it out? Anyone else who has gone through this horrible addiction please share there thoughts/experiences about this? I just want to make sure it eventually stops, and if I've done any major/permanent damage to my lungs. Fingers crossed!

Thanks in advance.

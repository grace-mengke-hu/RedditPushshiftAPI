Minor relapse :(

After being smoke free for just over 100 days, I had a few puffs last night after drinking heavily and staying up until 4am. 
Feeling soooo shitty and regretful this morning!
I’m not going to re-set my quit date, since it was only a few puffs one night and NOT to be repeated!
However, I’m pretty disappointed in myself and I kind of feel like all that hard work is down the drain.

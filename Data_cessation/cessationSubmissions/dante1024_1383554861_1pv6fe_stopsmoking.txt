I hate the word "quitting"

So this is day 4 (badge is terribly inaccurate if it's still there lol).

I can't stand people referring to "quitting smoking". The word "quit" implies something negative. Giving up something good. I'm getting over an addiction. I've quit nothing. I've become more healthy.

In fact, one thing that I read on line referred to someone stopping smoking as "the quitter". And don't even get me started on government websites! All you ever see on them is the word "quit".

Does anyone else feel like this? Or is it just me?

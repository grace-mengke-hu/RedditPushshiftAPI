Two years off, still feeling effects

I started smoking when I was 14 on and off to be cool around my friends.  It quickly turned into an addiction when I got my driver's license and a job and had the ability to be away from the house for extended periods of time.  I quit once, for a boy, which was dumb.  Eventually I started smoking behind his back and went back to where I left off.  However, two years ago I just decided I was done.  I didn't feel like smoking anymore.  Over 2-3 months I quit smoking and started running.

This is my first summer running long distances.  I've never ran anything more than a 5k in the heat and humidity.  Well recently on my longer runs (over 5 miles) I started wheezing.  My bf became concerned and told me to go to the doc.  Well I just left and it looks like, even though I'm trying to be healthy, the 10 years of smoking has followed me in the form of reactive airways (a.k.a. asthma) induced by exercise.  

So please learn from my mistakes.  Obviously you are on this sub to try and quit and I'm sure there are a thousand reasons in your head that will try to keep you smoking.  I've said them all to myself before.  But here I am, 26, and having to use an inhaler for the first time ever because I wanted to look cool for my friends.  Don't extend your time smoking any longer.

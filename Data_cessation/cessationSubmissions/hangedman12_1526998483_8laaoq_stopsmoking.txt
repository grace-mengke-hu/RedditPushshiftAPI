Threw out my training wheels

I’m a cold turkey kinda guy, if I huff on a vape pen or lean onto patches/gums every day... I just fall over back into smoking. So I’ve been off cigs for a month and change now but did have one thing I would lean on in moments if weakness that I’m ready to say goodbye to.

I live in a very heavy smoking city that makes quitting extra hard so I’ve had to also stop going out drinking as most bars are smoking or put you in close proximity to that activity. 

So I’ve just been having a couple glasses of wine at home to unwind most evenings which is fine unless I have more than 3. It’s not often, twice a week at most but that’s the only time my cravings have been so bad that I have to do something to quiet them. So I had a little bucket I’d throw my butts in so I don’t litter my sidewalk. I’d smoke a stub out of that rather than get a whole cig somewhere else. 

This was very gross but that’s part of why it worked, it didn’t make me want any more than the couple puffs I had, the available stubs got smaller and grosser the more I used this crutch, and you’d be amazed at how much worse that tiny bit of tobacco makes you feel. I’d wake up the next morning and my whole body would object to that small intake so much I wouldn’t have a craving for a couple days after. Until last week when I had one and even as I lit it I wanted to stop, so I went back inside and threw the whole butt receptacle out.

Only the coldest of turkey from here on out. Wish me luck! 

Anyone else use the gross factor to try and retrain yourself out of smoking? Or have unconventional training wheels?

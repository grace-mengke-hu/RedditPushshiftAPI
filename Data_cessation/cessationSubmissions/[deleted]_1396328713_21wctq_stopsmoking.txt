It's been eight hours

I can feel the withdrawals heading for me like a tidal wave. I'm not going to have any until tomorrow morning, and then, bam. Every form of withdrawal at once. This is how it's always happened for me. I get fevers, cold sweats, and full body aches as well as the irritability, depression, etc. What can I do? Help me. I don't want to fail yet again.

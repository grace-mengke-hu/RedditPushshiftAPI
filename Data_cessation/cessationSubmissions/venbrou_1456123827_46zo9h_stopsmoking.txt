Trick I used for when cold-turkey failed.

I figured out how to use nicotine gum. It's a psychological trick. The idea is to retrain your mind to associate gum chewing with getting it's nicotine fix.  

Step one: Buy your last pack of cigs. Along with it, buy a box of nicotine gum and a pack of regular gum. Make sure both gums are the same flavor.

Step two: Smoke when you want. Chew gum, nicotine or regular, whenever you want as well. Get used to gum chewing.

Step three: When your last pack of smokes runs out, go buy more. But you're not really buying more smokes. You're buying more nicotine gum. This is where the trick starts.

Step four: Learn to savor that nicotine gum whenever you would normally smoke. You never really stopped smoking, you just found a different way to do it. Toy around with chewing regular gum in place of the nicotine gum, but don't make a big deal about it. Continue with this for the next week or so.  

Step five: Quit the nicotine gum all together. By now, you've probably noticed something amazing: Chewing a piece of regular gum brings the same calming, satisfied sensation that nicotine gum does, however short-lived it may be.  

Step six: Enjoy your new chewing gum addiction.

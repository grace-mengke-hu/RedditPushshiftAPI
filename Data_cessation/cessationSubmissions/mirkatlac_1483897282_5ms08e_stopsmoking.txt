Dreams about smoking

Hey everyone!
Today is day 8 without a cigarette (Woo hoo!) but every night I keep having dreams where I smoke. Each time it's a very realistic situation, where I drink too much, someone offers me a cigarette, I accept and smoke it, and even reset my badge in my dream. I always wake up confused if it was real or not, and I'm always glad to wake up still a non-smoker. 
I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light on how long I'll have dreams about smoking for? 
Thanks!

I slipped up

It’s been 9 months since I had a cigarette. I had tried quitting countless times and never made it more than a few weeks. I finally quit because I met a girl who I fell for almost instantly and I didn’t want her to know I smoked. I threw my pack away that day and never looked back, and it was one of the easiest things I ever did. 

We’ve been dating for a while now and had our first fight today. Work has been a clusterfuck lately as well, and today I just snapped. I left work at noon, bought a pack of cigarettes, went home and started drinking. That was almost 11 hours ago now; I’ve smoked almost a pack, and I’m sitting on my balcony drinking wine listening to sad music and working on finishing off the pack. 

I’m not going to let this start my habit back up. I didn’t handle my problems in a healthy way today, but it’s one day and it’s almost over. Tomorrow I start back at day 1.

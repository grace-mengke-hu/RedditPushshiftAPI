TMI - poop talk

I'm at 3 weeks + 1 day smoke free, 3rd day without a patch, and doing well. I still have my triggers, but life without smoking is becoming easier and easier. 

The point of this post was to confess one of my biggest fears regarding quitting: pooping. I have always relied on coffee and a cigarette to get things moving in the morning, but since quitting I have found that coffee can so the job solo AND my poop is a thousand times healthier! Perfect color, consistency, etc! Hell yes for regularity!! Anyone else have this experience?

The worst thing about quitting smoking are the bad dreams about smoking

I have tired to quit before many times and have always had this problem. This time i have quit smoking for about 11 days and i've already had two dreams about smoking. I dreamt last night i had smoked half a packet of cigarettes and had one in my my mouth, I felt upset by this and that i had failed again. When i woke up i obviously was relieved, but also pretty pissed off about the dream. Cigarettes are like the fucking devil and get in my head and try and trick me when i'm sleeping. Fuck smoking!

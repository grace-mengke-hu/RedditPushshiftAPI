The scary thing about quitting smoking...

... is how damn easy it really is. Why have I gone 12 years of feeling like shit when it was this easy to quit?

I'm 29, been smoking for 12 years. In that time I have given 1 serious attempt at quitting, which lasted for 2 years. I recall it being "easy" to do then, and it honestly feels easy to do now (just passed the 48 hour mark). 

Though my body is constantly trying to trick me into smoking, the only part of quitting which is tremendously hard is that original decision to say no to cigs. 

Here's to a healthier life.

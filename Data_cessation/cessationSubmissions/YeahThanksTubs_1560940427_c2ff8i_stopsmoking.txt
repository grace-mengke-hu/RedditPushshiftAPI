First time submit long time lurker. Collapsed day 6 into 7

I chose the wrong week but it still feels right. Yesterday I bought cigarellos to starve off what I usually want when having beers with my mates/co-workers.

Of course I ended up punching through them because smoking is normal with beers and co-workers/mates.

The cigarettes I had (four) tasted awful but the habit was satisfied. Where the fuck do I go from here other than "don't smoke". I don't want to vape or replace it just shake the hell out of the habit.

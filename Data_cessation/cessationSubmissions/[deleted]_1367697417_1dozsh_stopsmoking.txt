Day two. About to pull my hair out, but also a little proud!

Out of the blue I just quit smoking. I'm tired of constantly smelling like smoke and having a pack of cigaretts control my life. I've been almost a pack a day for two years, so my withdraws right now crazy. I've been subbing a dum dum sucker for a cigarette when I'm in the car and that helps a little. It's the hardest when I have my breaks at work, even more so if we had a crazy rush. I cry a lot, but this is something I really want.

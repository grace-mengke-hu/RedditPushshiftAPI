Bright red blood in phlegm

Guys please help me! Iâ€™m 9 days smoke free and been coughing since the 3rd/4th day. Initially my phlegm was clear and just barely I saw a bright red blood. Iâ€™m so scared! Iâ€™ve smoked since I was 21 and Iâ€™m now 25.5 years old. I usually smoked 5-7 cigs a day. Iâ€™m so scared!!! Please help ðŸ˜ž

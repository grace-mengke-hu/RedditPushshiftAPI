A few hours ago I smoked my last cigarett and I'm dying.

I tried to quit a few times before but I always loved smoking (well or my addiction made my brain think I love it).  
Now I am so certain to quit it forever. I want to quit. A few hours I had my last one, I even downloaded a smokefree-app... maybe those health and money infos help me better - when I have specific numbers in front of me.  
But now I can't think about anything but smoking. How I light one up, how I inhale all those nice, delicious, pain reducing, satisfying toxics. It's so hard. :( I don't want to be nervous anymore or that my body is shivering - and I don't want to wait a few days being exposed to that horrible feeling of withdrawal.  
It would be so much easier to abandon myself to the desire.

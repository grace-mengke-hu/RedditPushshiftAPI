Yesterday marked 6 months since I quit!

I have never posted here before, but I've been lurking for a while and I just wanted to share my milestone in case it inspires someone else. 

I am officially six months smoke free. I actually forget that I used to smoke, unless I am drinking or around other smokers. But the smell makes me sick, I am glad to stay inside and out of the Minnesota winter, and I am proud of myself every day. 

I quit for my nephew. He was born six days after I quit. I told myself I didn't want to be a chainsmoking aunt (I am already a lesbian with two cats, I am kooky enough). 

Here's how I did it:
- Good old Allen Carr. I devoured the book in a day and it was the first time that quitting made sense. Why? Because I stopped justifying my addiction. 
- I was already taking Wellbutrin (250 mg once daily) for depression and anxiety, and so my doctor kept me on that. 

AND THATS IT, YOU GUYS! You can do this! I smoked for eight years and at my worst, I was over a pack a day. YOU CAN DO THIS!

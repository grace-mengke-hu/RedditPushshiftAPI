Will power is a sailboat not a rowboat.

A rowboat is hard slow individual work. Too hard. A sailboat uses the natural forces around it to glide quickly. When quitting smoking don't force things too hard, but point in the right direction, call on good friends, and glide away from temptation. Happy sailing.

101 days? Wow. Look at me go.

I can't believe where I'm at today. It feels like it was just yesterday where I was stuffing my face with second servings and extra dessert all just to try and combat the nicotine cravings. Now here I am. 101 days later and thousands more to go. Yeah, I still think about it from time to time. But not like I used to. Toady is the day where I can confidently call myself a "nonsmoker".

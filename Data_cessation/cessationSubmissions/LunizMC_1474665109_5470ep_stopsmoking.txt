4 weeks

Feeling great, psychologically.  Haven't noticed any real physical benefits to be honest, but that doesn't matter. Can't believe I was in here a few months ago, complaining that it was too difficult. Seems a million years ago. For those of you struggling, or thinking about it, or thinking it's beyond your reach, think again.  It gets easier. Just get through the first three weeks, which are tough, no doubt. You will slowly stop thinking about it.

First 24 hours without a puff of smoke in 8 years.

Since 17 years of age, I've been smoking regularly. Not a day went past for me without having at least 1 cigarette to smoke. 
But yesterday I decided it stops, today!! 
And this is my first full day without even a single puff of smoke. 
Is it hard? Yes! 
Do I want to smoke? Yes! 
But what I want more is to quit, to get done with this awful habit, once and for good. 
Do I feel like I can do it? No! 
But do I think I can do it? Hell yes!! And I am going to prove it to everybody but most importantly to myself that I am stronger than what I feel to be.

Wellbutrin? Compare notes?

The docs put me on wellbutrin for other reasons, but it...it changed EVERYTHING about my ability to not smoke. 

For years I couldn't watch a 2 hour movie without thinking about having a smoke and getting fidgety and becoming incredibly preoccupied with he thought of smoking. But, on wellbutrin, day one, I hated the taste of my brand and couldn't make it through a cigarette. Its been a bit of a miracle pill for me in terms of not smoking I will ignore having had  basically all the other side effects for the first week.

Now it's been like 2 weeks and I suddenly have a persistent craving like I haven't had in the past. 

Is this typical?

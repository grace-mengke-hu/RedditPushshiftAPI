Quitting & Vivid Dreams

Since quitting smoking I can remember all my dreams and its weird because when I was smoking I couldn't remember any dreams; maybe only a handful every month or so. I never thought anything of it but now I can remember every individual dream I have in a single night. They seem very vivid and real that I wake up sweating. Yet my dreams are not about smoking at all. I quite like it to be honest.

I quit cold turkey without any help from pharmaceuticals, don't take any medication, and haven't changed my routine recently except for quitting so I'm assuming its caused by quitting.

Has anybody else experienced this?

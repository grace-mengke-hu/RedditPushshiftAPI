My smoking makes absolutely no sense

Currently 20 years old, overweight and a brass musician. I started smoking 4 months ago and my reasoning completely baffles my mind. It has been detrimental to me in every way. Most noticeably is itâ€™s effect on my lung capacity which I notice every time I pick up my instrument (bass trombone). I have struggles with body image issues and told myself that smoking could help me lose weight. Today this all changes. I will never smoke a cigarette again and will now make the changes to actually lead a healthy lifestyle. The right way this time. I will do this!

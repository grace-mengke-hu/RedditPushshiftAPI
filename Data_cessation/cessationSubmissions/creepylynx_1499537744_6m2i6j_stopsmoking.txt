I heavily overestimated my willpower.

When I was younger I told myself I would never start smoking. I told myself I had too much willpower to let a little stick take control of my life. I told myself after my first cigarette that I could give it or take it. That I could easily go without one.  So I thought I would go for another one. Yeah, that will be my last one. I don't want to become addicted right? 1 year later and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of not being able to lay in bed and do nothing without needing to go out for a smoke. I'm sick of not being to go to sleep unless I've had my dose of nicotine. I want this to end before I fall deeper down the rabbit hole. I'm only 16 and I'm ready to quit. I'm sick of lying to everybody around me. I just smoked a cigarette 10 minutes ago. And I hope to god that will be my last one. So. Day 1. Here I go. Wish me luck

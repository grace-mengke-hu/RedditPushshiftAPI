Not a cheer leading post, but I have to say it

I'm on my ninth day of not smoking, so all the nicotine has left my body. While this is an accomplishment, I feel sad today and that makes me want to smoke. I won't, because I'm committed to the health and beauty benefits quitting will afford, but it's a white-knuckle moment for me right now.

Why? Because the addiction of cigarettes for me has been in the emotional crutch, not the nicotine. They were my ritual to meditate by and center myself. I could be alone with my cigarette and my thoughts. They were my friends that got my neurons to fire the right way when I needed repose. Now I am lonely and sad.

"Exercise!" "Find a new hobby!" "Try snacking on carrots!" "Why don't you just meditate for real?!"

It's not the same, and you know it. In this moment, I just want to mourn the loss of a habit that's ultimately too destructive to keep up, but still provided a lot of comfort. The LOGIC of the cost/benefit of quitting is clear, but please, can we acknowledge the power of it's emotional hold?

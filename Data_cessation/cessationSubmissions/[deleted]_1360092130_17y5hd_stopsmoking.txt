Calm before the storm?

After smoking a pack a day for 14 years, I am on Day 4 of not smoking. So far I'm really doing okay. Yes I've wanted to smoke, but I just didn't. I'm feeling so good about myself and really positive. 
So my question is, Is it going to get harder before it's all said and done? I'm waiting for a breakdown or a tantrum, tears, something. I know this is one of the hardest things I have ever done and I feel like I'm in a false cocoon of happiness right now and it's all going to come crashing down at some point.

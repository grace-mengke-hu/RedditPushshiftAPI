My experiences being tobacco free after seven months...

I just wanted to share what it has been like being tobacco free for seven months at this point.  I rarely think about cigarettes, and I only have maybe one craving per week.  Usually this is triggered by a friend smoking a cigarette in front of me, or seeing a character do so in a movie or on TV. 

As far as appetite is concerned, I never noticed an uptick in food cravings.  In fact, I have lost quite a bit of weight recently due to a lack of appetite.  However, your experience may vary, especially considering the fact that I've never had weight problems in my life, and the cessation of smoking never had an effect on any of that.  

Looking back, I would say that the worst cravings were gone within about one week, and residual cravings persisted for about one to two months thereafter.  By about month three, I rarely experienced cravings for cigarettes.  Point is, grit your teeth, stick it out, and you will make it.  Get to the three month mark, and you are home free.

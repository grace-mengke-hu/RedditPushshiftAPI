Smokers cough won’t go away

I quit almost 4 months ago. I have had a cough for almost 3 years (smoked for 12 years) after a month my cough subsided slightly. But since then I think it hasn’t changed at all. I still cough when I my heart rate increases. I cough walking fast and cough a lot at the gym. Does anyone have any experience with a it lasting this long? I’ve been to the doctors for bronchitis a few times while I smoked. In fact every time I got a cold I would develop bronchitis. I had my first cold recently since quitting and no bronchitis :-)

i want to keep my heart healthy. can i get some advice?

hey guys. i dont lead the healthiest life. i kinda eat like crap right now since i dont have lots of cash at the moment and im fearing for my heart and arteries. sometimes i get these heart murmer things. they dont last long but its really concerning. can any of you give me some advice on how to keep a relatively healthy heart and lungs? and maybe what pushed you to quit or cut back. thanks

A bit more than 2 weeks now, but going back to work has been harder than expected

Hey everyone,

I have smoked my last cigarette 18 days ago, when I went on vacation. Before that, I smoked for 15 years, between half a pack and a pack a day.

My boyfriend is an avid non-smoker, and me smoking has been a source of (mild) friction before us.

So I made the decision to quit when I went on vacation a bit more than 2 weeks ago. For myself, it was never enough motivation to do it, but for my boyfriend, I could see myself doing it.

The first days weren't easy, but I got through them, and after a bit more than a week I didn't even need the crutch of the (nicotine free) vape anymore. Sure, there were cravings, and I had some really vivid dreams about smoking, which surprised me a bit....

Today is my first day back to work, though. My boyfriend flew home two days ago (we are in a long distance relationship), and I am sitting here at home, working. During the work day, the rituals of smoking were the most ingrained. Once an hour, I would get up, go out on the balcony, and have a smoke.

And so I have been craving really bad today. I expected it to be hard, but honestly not this bad after more than two weeks of being smoke free.....

5 days in and Im doing ok

So i have been trying to quit since I had my kids, their five now.  I have been smoking since i was 16, Im 34. I tried everything and kept going back. My fianc√© hated that I smoked and would refuse to kiss me. Finally I said  need your help. He said fine, lets make a deal, If you smoke I get to smack you (FYI he has never harmed me a day in our life). I shook on it and then later asked him if he really would. He said, "To save your life, yes". Oddly enough I believe him, and haven't smoked since. Although this may seem drastic, I needed drastic or I would have continued to die slow. Every time i get the urge to smoke, I think about the consequences and I don't do it. Normally I would think that I have time to quit, or i have this under control but I didn't. There is no hiding the smell, or the effects you don't see. After five days, my body has begun it recovery process and I am grateful. Im more grateful to have somebody who cares so much that they would go to those lengths to save my life.

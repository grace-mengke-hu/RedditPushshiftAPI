My boyfriend and I have gone a full 24 hours without a cigarette..

I feel wonderful, like I could take on the world! But he is absolutely miserable.. He is shaking and incredibly on edge!! We quit cold turkey and any suggestions on how to make his ride a little easier would be greatly appreciated!! :)

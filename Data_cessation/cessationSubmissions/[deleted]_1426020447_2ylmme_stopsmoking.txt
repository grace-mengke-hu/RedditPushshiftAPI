Hello everyone.

I haven't had a cigarette in what'll be twenty four hours shortly after posting this. I went to a Walgreens and purchased a starter pack of Fin Electronic Cigarettes. Does anyone have any insight into whether or not electronic cigarettes are an effective assistance into quitting, or any insight into whether or not they are (relatively) safe to consume? I've read about it quite a bit online, but I'd love to know what people online think. 

I just don't see myself being able to quit cold turkey otherwise. I can give up many of the habits involved with smoking - but the physical act of holding something, inhaling and exhaling the vapor, doing it after a meal - all of that is entirely ingrained in my head at this point. 

I feel like using e-cigarettes is surely at least better than using the real thing. But maybe I'm misguided.

My bank account

I know it hasn't been long since I quit but just had a look at my checking account and noticed how the balance really hasn't changed much since I last had a look at it ( maybe 1 week ago?) I'm not making $10 purchases every other day for smokes anymore and I can tell! Smoke Free App says I'll save just under $2000/year. That alone is a huge reason to stay quit! 

Other than the obvious health reasons, what changes/improvements have you noticed recently??

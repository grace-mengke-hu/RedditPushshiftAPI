Strong cravings after a month

I’ve been having incredibly strong cravings the last couple days, since I passed the month mark. It could be the nicer weather, could be stress at work, could be a rejection I got from a potential date, could be all of the above! 

Has anyone else had this after they hit a milestone? I think I was really motivated getting through week 1, then 2, then 3...now I just feel kinda blah. Like, what’s the point?

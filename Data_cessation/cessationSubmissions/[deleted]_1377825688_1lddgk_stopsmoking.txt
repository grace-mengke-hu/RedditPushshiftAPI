8 Days!

Dudes and ladies, an update.

I've been hella distracting/focusing myself with a new running training plan. It was definitely tough to feel a little handicapped at something I used to be pretty into (I'd only been smokin' for a year, so it was a recent memory thing). 

But it was way better to go suffer a little than to tell myself some nonsense like "nahh, I've had too many cigarettes to feel good working out, I'll just stay in". 

Today I feel like I have a new pair of lungs! Super positive and centered.

Thanks for being a source I could scroll through for good support vibes :)

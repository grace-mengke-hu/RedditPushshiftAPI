Never again!!!

So, I've decided to change my life completely, i'm tired of waking up in the morning and think that it's gonna be completely same as the previous day with all the lies I tell myself - I'm gonna quit smoking, start healthy lifestyle, etc. So, I've decided that this is the day, had my last cigarette yeterday at 9 in the afternoon and it's already 20 hours withouth a single puff, feeling proud, and the best part I don't even want to smoke, for some reason it feels so easy this time! Thank you guys, you are awesome ;)

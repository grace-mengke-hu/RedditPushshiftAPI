This time quitting is being much harder.

Started smoking at age 14. Now, at 48 yo, I quit smoking for a “gaziollionth” time. Longest I have stayed Somber was about 6 years. One day, after my mother was admitted in the ER, I though: “one cig will do no harm”... Well, here I am 13 years later and quitting again.

This time it is being much harder.  I’ve got a 10yo boy that I love more than anything in the universe an a Blood Cancer diagnostic that I received just 4 days ago.

Must say that for the first time the cravings are being the easy part. Dealing with my own stupidity and it consequences... THAT is being hard!

I will fight this two front war! And I will win!! I just cannot help but wonder if I had not given in to that 1 cigarette 13  years ago....

So please, when you are trying to convince yourself that  just one cig is ok (and it will happen several times), just think that THAT might be the one that could kill you!

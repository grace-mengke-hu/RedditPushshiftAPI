1 year! You’ve got this.

Hi! So... It’s been a year without smoking. I used to smoke 25 cigs a day, for ten years. I live with my boyfriend, who is still a heavy smoker. I used to caugh all the time and I thought It was normal. It wasn’t. I gained weight but it was totally worth it. Best decission ever. It feels great. 

Cravings will go away. You can do this. 

Excuse my English, love from Spain (a country of smokers...)

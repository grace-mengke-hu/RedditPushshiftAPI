Getting my head around 1 week ...

So here goes, i have just joined this page after being referred and reading many an inspiring story and seeing so much support and guidance. 

I haven't really tried to quit before , well we (my partner and I) have said yes we'll quit a few times previously and me being me sneakily buy a packet and hide them in my car all week only smoking when i'm away from the house. The reality is we need to stop and this my first real attempt at it. The cost of smoking in Australia (Gold Coast) is ridiculous approx $20 per packet of 25 so who the heck can afford that, but i guess you would always find a way. And no one wants to see a preggers lady do they , not yet but hopefully on the cards in the next 12 months. 

So this is my first proper attempt, no lies , no rubbish, no patches, supplements or any other crutches and i'm nearly a week in and doing GREAT. I find it very difficult at times and those voices in my head are terrible but thus far i have managed to beat them and will continue to do so. I am being a bit of a grumpy bugger to my partner we are both slightly irritable with each other (stopping together) but hopefully that will fade. I'm really not sure why I'm writing this but I just feel the need to get it out ! Good luck to you and I hope I can continue to remain strong !

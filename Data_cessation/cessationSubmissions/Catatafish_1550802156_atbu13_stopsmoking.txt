Some questions before I quit.

Started smoking at 16. I smoked for about 1 month, and I hated how I would smell, my fingers reeking of that shit etc especially when I had to hide it. So instead of cutting at 1 month my dumbass 16 year old self moved onto vaping because I liked the nicotine. I should've just stopped right then and there.

I have probably 80ml 0mg nic left, and about 30ml 3mg (have been diluting the 3m to 1.5 or so), and will quit once I run out. Hopefully I get through the worst of it during the 0mg part. I've always wanted to try West cigarettes so I'll do that tomorrow. Just 1 cig since I loved the West Mercedes McLaren as kid - always wondered what the cigarette tasted like, and I know I have to try it or It'll never stop bothering me.

**Finally, the questions.**  While I DO want to quit cigarettes, and vaping cause fuck that - how does the nicotine addiction work? I want to possibly smoke cigars every now and then (by every now and then I mean once a year TOPS). If I quit smoking for say 1-2 years, and I smoke a fat cuban will I go straight back to balls deep cravings from just 1 cigar? I know I'm just making excuses, but I still want to know. Yeah, I've never even smoke a cigar....

Also, any tips?

After 45 years as a smoker, I've been smoke free for 104 hours!

45 years. Damn. It's kind of hard to admit I've been a slave to tobacco for that long. I started smoking a week after my 13th birthday. Exactly 1 week after my 58th birthday I finally put them down. For good, I hope. I've been smoke free for 104 hours. 

I'm glad I found this subreddit. I have a feeling I'm going to need to hear other people's stories and progress - and maybe get a little encouragement when the cravings hit.

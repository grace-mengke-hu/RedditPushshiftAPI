Has anyone used supplements to lessen the withdrawals from quitting smoking?

I quit smoking a few years back cold turkey and the first 3 months were tough. I managed to get through it and after the three months I felt great. 

I’m in sales and I’m worried if I quit again it will affect my performance like it did my last job. 

Anyone try quitting cold turkey using supplements like 5 htp and tyrosine etc...

One thing I did wrong when I quit the first time is I drank a lot of sugar and caffeine so I’m sure that made it worse. This time around my diet is much better and now I’m working out. Weights and cardio. Still worried that I might go through that mentally unstable and unfocused state again.

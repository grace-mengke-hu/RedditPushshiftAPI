Seriously feeling the craves today.

Why did I ever start this disgusting habit?  And when do the cravings stop?  I am so sick of craving a cigarette.  Not that I'm going to run out and smoke, because quitting has made me realize that I craved cigarettes even while I was smoking.  I'm just super frustrated.

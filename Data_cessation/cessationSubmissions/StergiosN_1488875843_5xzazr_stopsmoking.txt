5th day

Started last Saturday. I was going well, carvings not extremely strong, till yesterday afternoon, when my wife announced me her decision to proceed to a hip surgery, as she is suffering from hip OA. I was started feeling bad, what will it be the outcome, who should care her, as I am partially disabled by a failed knee survey, after an accident some years ago, and I couldn't resist to stress and bought cigarettes and started smoking again. A defeat, for sure. I decided to continue. Even so! Problems are a part of life, smoking cannot help us solve them. Today morning I tried coffee without smoking. It succeeded! Smoke free for the moment. I am curious,what it will be next morning. All tips they say to cope with stress fail speaking short term. I think most of all counts the continuous and insisting will. Even defeated once, the war against smoking goes on!!! I hope I am the winner in the end. 
Keep on!! Give me  your positive vibes, I need it.

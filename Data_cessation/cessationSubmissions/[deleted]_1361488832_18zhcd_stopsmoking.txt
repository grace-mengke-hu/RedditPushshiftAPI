Photoshop penises to stop smoking

I have recently viewed a TED talk: http://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man.html.  Where the lecturer describes how a Turkish ruler abolished the wearing of the veil by making it mandatory for all prostitutes to wear one.  I think there are currently campaigns where governments are placing horrifying and gross images on cigarette packages to deter smoking.  I was wondering if changing the social undertone of smoking, like what the Turkish ruler did with the veil, would help people stop smoking?

For example, I propose starting a "Penises4Smokers" campaign where people find cool pictures of people smoking and upload photoshopped copies of the images with the cigarettes replaced by penises.

What I am really curious about is what got you into smoking and what sort of persuasions it would take/took for you to decide to stop?

60 days smoke free!

After I finished my first year of college, I decided to quit smoking. It was difficult at first, and I admit I relapsed a couple of times. It didn't stop me from wishing that I could be a normal non-smoker, who didn't worry about having a cigarette every few minutes or worrying about my smell.

It's been easier than I expected, mainly since I wasn't near college which is where I mainly smoked like a chimney. The real challenge will be going back and not slipping back into old habits. I've got great support though.

I want to thank everyone here. Visiting this subreddit made the insane cravings at the beginning bearable. Good luck on your own endeavors!

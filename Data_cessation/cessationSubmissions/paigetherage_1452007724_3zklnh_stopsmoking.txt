The fog is clearing...

Four days in, I have to say that my favorite unforeseen benefit of quitting after ten years of pack-a-day smoking is that my head feels clear. I might be imagining this, but I feel like I'm *smarter* now that I don't smoke. Thoughts are coming to me more quickly; I feel more motivated at work and more capable of taking on projects. I also feel so much more confident -- I can't believe I lived in the land of fog and self-deception for so long. It feels so good to be free!

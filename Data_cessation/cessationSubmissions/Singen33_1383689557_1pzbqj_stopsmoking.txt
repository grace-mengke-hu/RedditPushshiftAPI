Don't Even Know Where to Start..

Fellow Redditors, self hating smokers and those who have prevailed. I really don't know where to begin. I've been smoking on and off since High school (not in my final semester of college). I want to want to quit, im having trouble finding motivation. I's stressed to the max, working two jobs taking a full load of credits and looking for full time employment post graduation. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks!

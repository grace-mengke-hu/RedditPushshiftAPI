Just bought a box of snuff, has anyone had any success with it?

I'm aware that it's still bad for your health, and doesn't sort out the nicotine addiction in any way, but I'm just so hooked and want to wake up in the morning without having to cough up brown phlegm. To those who use it; will it leave my nose all stuffy and irritated? And is it worse than the bunged up smoker's chest? It definitely seems like the lesser of two evils. Of course the end goal is to cease nicotine intake altogether, but cold turkey is never gonna happen. I've tried and failed a few times now with patches and gum, and chewing tobacco is just filth.

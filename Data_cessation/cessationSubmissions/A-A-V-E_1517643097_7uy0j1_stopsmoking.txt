I caved in

I had gone four days without smoking and I finally gave in. It's just a small setback though. I haven't totally given up. I noticed that right before I had a rush of negative feelings and old regrets that I couldn't ignore. I realized that cigarettes enabled me to stuff down my feelings and distract myself. How do you guys deal with the onslaught of negative memories when they arise?

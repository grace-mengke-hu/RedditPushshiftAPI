Starting new again

So I went about 3 weeks without a full cigarette, but then the last 2 days I was having some delusional anxiety, and smoked about 10 cigarettes total in between those two days. Now that I have my emotions better under control, I am going to be restarting this quit attempt. And I will make it my last quit attempt! Going to proactively change my life and secure any weaknesses to make sure the nicotine-trap never finds its way to me again. 
Any advice from any successful quitters would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks everyone and stay sober!

Struggling

Strange as it is, on my eighth day and I'm really craving badly now. It's obviously not the nicotine, but that doesn't stop me thinking how nice it would be to smoke. I guess part of it is being a weekend. I'm worried I'm going to fail tonight and I really don't want to feel like shit tomorrow, which I will do. Essentially wasting a good eight days without nicotine and having to start again. I know it won't help and it will taste like shit too, but it's not stopping me thinking about it.

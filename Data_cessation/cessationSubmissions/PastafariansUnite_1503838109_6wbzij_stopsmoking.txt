I need help quitting you guys

Any tips or tricks that really helped you guys quit smoking? I want to quit so bad but generally don't last more than a day before a breakdown and buy a pack. I don't want to use chantix or anything because I already get super horrifying sleep paralysis and apparently chantix gives you "vivid dreams" No thanks. I suck at meditating. I have tried to avoid places I usually smoke but I mean come on, it's really hard to avoid your own front/ back porch. I hate everything about smoking but I am seriously struggling to muster the willpower to quit so I'll take anyone's advice. (Serious advice. I'm not gonna lick the floor or anything anytime I get a craving) What honestly worked for you? Thanks in advance for helping me live longer!

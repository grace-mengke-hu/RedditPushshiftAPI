New book to recommend that will help you quit :0

The Power of Habit, by Charles Duhigg is an extremely good book I've recently picked up. It explains how we make habits, and how habits are at the core of every activity that we do.

Smoking, as we all know, is a habit. 

So, if smoking is a habit, and you learn how to change habits, you should be able to quit smoking more easily. Right?

Well, it also explains keystone habits: habits that lead to other habits.

For example, when I quit smoking, I started exercising again, eating better, and got a lot more productive. It appears smoking was a keystone habit that was holding me back from a lot of my potential.

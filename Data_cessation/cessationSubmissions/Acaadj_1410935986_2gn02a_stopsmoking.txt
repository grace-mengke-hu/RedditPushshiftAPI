YES! I've been patiently waiting for my reset.

So. Melatonin didn't work. I'm awake.

What did I plan to do with my awakeness? I BOUGHT THE BOOK Y'ALL. I bought the goddamn book. And I fucking read every word.

I AM A NONSMOKER. YIPPPPIEEEEEE.

I can see why this works. It just did for me.

Thank you guys for the suggestion, and for not pointing out that my "willpower" way was highlighted in the book, and why I was not being successful. (IE... Calling me an imbicile.)

I love you all! Hope you are having great evenings/days!

I am resetted, and I am totally ready for my life now.

"Hey, ACAADJ.. what part was most impactful?"

I am paying for something to kill me.

Instead of getting that next pack, buy. this. book. Or don't. You don't know me. But I'm recommending it. 100x over.

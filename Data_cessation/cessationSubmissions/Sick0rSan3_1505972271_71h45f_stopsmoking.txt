To shreds, you say?

Hello /r/stopsmoking, I've been smoking these wretched things for ten years now and would like to stop, but almost everyone I know smokes, so I know I won't be able cut myself away from them completely. I'm curious as to how you guys and gals coped with the withdrawals when around people who are smoking? Anything you guys did while friends were smoking to keep your mind off of it? My quit day is tomorrow night, so I'll be shredding the last cigs before I go to bed. I chose tomorrow so I have the full weekend to get the worst of the cravings gone before going back to work. Any advice is welcomed. This time I'm going to try to stay strong through the worst and hopefully come out the other side a healthier, more productive person.  With a little extra cash to boot!

I've read Alan Carr, and it kind of helped, but only for a short time. Are there any other resources you guys would suggest? 

Let's do this together!

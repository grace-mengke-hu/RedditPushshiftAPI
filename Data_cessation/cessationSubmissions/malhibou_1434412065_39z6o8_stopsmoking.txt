8 days and 2 mini-victories

Mini-victory #1: Made it through a weekend without smoking (including two nights out with friends who smoke)! Sure, I got drunk on Friday and asked a friend for one, but he was kind enough to tell me no...so I got drunker and forgot about the cigarette. Not the healthiest reaction long-term, but it worked.

Mini-victory #2: Made it through a whole Zumba class without having to stop for half a song to try and catch my breath. I was totally red in the face and breathing like an angry bull but smiling like crazy :)

8 days feels REALLY GOOD.

3 days, but should be 3 weeks...

Really glad i can last 3 days, but there is a situation that is making it complicated. I have enough will power to not go and buy a pack, but i found out the chinese lady from the bodega sells units for 30 cents. So i quit 3 weeks ago but found this out and been cheating with the old lady. 1 or 2 a day. I didn't do it on the weekend by staying home. Today i have to go out and am afraid i can only think about the old chinese lady. HALP!!

Edit: went out, didn't smoke. Am safe till tomorrow.

Day 5: I wanna tell everyone...

I'm into day five and I really feel like this quit is the last quit. I was waiting to tell people until I was well on my way and I wanna tell my friends and family because they will be so happy about it. Is it safe to tell them and get their hopes up?

TLDR: I want to start telling friends and family that I quit but only if it's safe to get hopes up. Is it time yet?

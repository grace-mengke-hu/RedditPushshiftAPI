Starting a log for myself (4/26/13), maybe some of you can help keep me honest.

For maybe four years now I have been smoking about a pack a week (not much comparatively, I know), and probably 90% or more of the time only while drinking, but I want to stop.

On the one hand, a pack a week should be an easy thing to stop doing, and believe me, I have thrown out several low, half, or even mostly full packs in an effort to make this happen, but then I go out for a drink and even if I only have one cigarette, I regret it. Usually of course it's at least a few.

On the other hand, I usually can go for three or four days in a row at a time anyway because of my work schedule and when I can go out for a drink.

Anyway, I want to keep a log that I can come back to, on a public forum so maybe some of you who have been in similar situations can help, but also to keep it honest.

I'm not sure about the rules on me coming in here everyday commenting on my own post, but that's more or less what I'm looking to do. If that's a no-no, maybe somebody can let me know how to keep a journal of sorts on here for everyone to see.

Anyway, 4/25/13 will effectively be Day 1. I had a couple cigarettes Wednesday night, with none on Thursday.

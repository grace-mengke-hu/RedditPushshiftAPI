Quitting e-cigs. Advice?

First of all, I thought I had my habit kicked a year and a half ago when I quit smoking, but I essentially just went straight to vaping. Now it's giving me tachycardia and I have to give it up.

Has anyone attempted to quit e-cigs? How does it measure up to quitting smoking? Thanks for any / all advice!

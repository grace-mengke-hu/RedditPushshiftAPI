The Silent Reformat...

So... almost 13 years ago as of february I turned 18 and bought my first pack like an idiot. My entire habit was pretty small and as such i was very successful in hiding said habit. maybe 8 years ago i moved in with some people that smoked which made it way too easy to conceal and the habit grew somewhat rapidly. when i first started a pack would last me 2-3 weeks, towards the end i was on the verge of a pack every day or two. some may say that is lightweight but i honestly liked the habit but knew all too well i was doing something so foolish, to this day I believe it played a part in my eye disease that partially robbed my left eye of vision and killed my chances at my career of being a welder. the shame I felt sucked, I felt if it ever had seen the light of day people would look at me like a failure. so I hid it for 13 years. as of today i'm a week into kicking this stupid habit, this being my big secret (we all have one) has not made it easy as I couldn't go looking for support in the endeavor and was too ashamed to talk to anyone about it. I have already begun feeling the benefits of quitting and hope that it continues going well. I tried in the past but failed, this time i will not... to those in a similar position to myself, I know what it's like to face this alone. In short I just want someone to know that i'm going to see it through this time...

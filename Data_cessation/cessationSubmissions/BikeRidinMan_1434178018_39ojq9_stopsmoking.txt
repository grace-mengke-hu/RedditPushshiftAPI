I feel I must post here right now.

I’ve been on this sub for several months. I’m here to try to provide help for those that need help. I’m not here to show off my flair (I’ve been accused of this several times). One of the reasons I’m on here is to help me strengthen my resolve in other areas of my life. Specifically, I’m talking about alcoholism. I had 159 days and went back out. So now I’m back to day 1. Addiction is a horrible disease. I’m an addict just like most of us on here. I guess what I’m trying to say is that all we have is today. One day at a time. I know I preach this on a regular basis. I’m trying to help the new comers on here just as much as I’m trying to help myself.

That’s why I’m here. You guys are the greatest. I love our little corner of Reddit. I’m no different than any of y’all. We are all fighting the horrible disease of addiction. 

I had a long talk with my psychiatrist today. As an ex fleet sailor in the USN, we are all in the same boat.

Love and peace,

BRM (Jim).

Day 4: out of zombie mode

I used to set 4-5 alarms at 10-15 minute intervals. I could never wake up before the last one and even when I did, I had to drag myself out of bed. I felt like a dead man walking for the next couple of hours.

Not today, though. Today I woke up fresh on my second alarm, no problems at all. The boost it gives my confidence is unbelievable.

You guys have been great support so far, so thanks for that. Something tells me my worst days aren't behind me yet and I'm going to need a lot more of your support.

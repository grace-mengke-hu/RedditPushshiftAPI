Does anyone else vape?

So I've been using a vape for about three months and I was having a lot of trouble still craving cigarettes. A friend suggested upping the nicotine level (I'm now up to 12mg) and it's working so much better. It's been about a month without a cigarette. However, I am worried that I am just trading one addiction for another. I know I can start slowly weening myself to lower nicotine levels, but the idea terrifies me. Late at night, when the cravings are the worst, I'll be sitting here vaping for about 45 minutes. I get so anxious if I don't. Any suggestions?

Smoking as a coping mechanism. (2 months update)

It's been 9 weeks since my last cigarette and i've finally understood, with your help, why it is so hard for me to get rid of them. 

After my first post a response from Tamingthemonkey stayed with me, it showed me that the main bulk of emotions i was feeling were not withdrawl symptoms but suppressed emotions.
I realised that, along with sport and a few other things, cigarettes were part of a system, and it's just so hard to get my bearings and adjust now.


It is an emotional stabilizer for me, when i read people and their opinions about smoking they don't seem to understand, i was reading a thread a few days ago on a french subreddit about cigarettes and smokers, people mainly argued that smokers "wanted to look cool", that it was a habit with very little effects besides relief from cravings, compared to alcohol or other drugs, but it's not that for me and i'm sure to a few of you too. I don't drink at all, i dislike drugs, but cigarettes have this brilliant way to subside the emotional pain, while sharpening the mind, without overwhelming the individual... it was the perfect drug in that way.

i've traveled for most of the month of may, which helped a lot, i felt better, i really needed to get out of my head in a way but i came back home a week ago and...All i want is one pack of malboro reds and one dunhill menthol lights.

I will try to push through, i'm not giving up just yet, i almost doubled the cardio, i feel a lot better in the hours that follow so i do cardio twice a day, i also try to practice concious breathing as often as i can, but cigarettes would be such an easy answer wouldn't they ?

Anyway, i really needed to vent about all of this, thanks for reading, i hope you are doing well yourself.

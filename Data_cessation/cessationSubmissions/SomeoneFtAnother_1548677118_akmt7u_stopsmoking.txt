One month!

Feels like I have been on this journey forever. On and off and back on again. I even went as far as to consider myself a social smoker. I convinced myself I did enjoy it and I looked cool doing it or whatever. Plus it went so damn well with booze, coffee and made one hell of a dessert after a sumptuous repast. I started cutting back slowly. Stopped smoking during the week, saving the 'treat' for the weekend instead. Now I made it one month and I'm really happy with my decision to quit entirely.  It was all a lie and I gave the addiction a lot of sway over me. It's not a treat. I really am enjoying life way more without it. My sense of smell is back, the weekend runs are getting better, I don't miss the bout of fatigue that kicks in after a smoke. I visit this sub very often and the motivational posts go along way in keeping me on the straight and narrow. Thank you for the inspiration. Not another puff!

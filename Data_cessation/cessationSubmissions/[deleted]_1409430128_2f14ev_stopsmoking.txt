So I'm just wondering here...

I'm off the cigarettes 11 days now, but I've been on the e-cigs during the 11 days. I started on 12mg, I've dropped down to 6mg in the last 3 days, and I seriously can't stop puffing on the e-cig since dropping. I feel better, eat better, finally have breakfast in the mornings. Wake up in the mornings and can go on walks, I love my life at this moment, I feel like I want to be fit and keep my body healthy. Doubled with anxiety abd depression this shit is hard, but I need to stay away from these horrible death sticks, and I can finally see myselg foinf through with it after about the 10th time.

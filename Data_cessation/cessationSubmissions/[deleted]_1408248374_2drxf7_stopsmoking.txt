So shit...

I just wan't to reinforce to never ever temp yourself with tobacco once you've quit. I was a non-smoker for 4 years and I thought I'd be fine to have a toke of a flavoured hookah, 2 weeks later I was a full blown smoker again... I'm so angry that I took it up again... I've had a few failed quit attempts since taking it back up... After spending the last hour pretty much bawling my eyes out in the garden, I forked out the coin to attend an Allen Carr seminar (again). Not much to this post but I just wanted to tell my story, hopefully it will prevent someone from experimenting.

How to cope when stress hits?

So I'm on day three again and was doing great and feeling really positive. I am however going through some crap with my ex wife and just got a bill and letter from my lawyer. The bill was over twice as much as I was expecting and instead of our issues coming to a close like I was expecting, it looks like they are gonna blow up bigger than ever before.
My first reaction now is I really want a fucking cigarette. So how do others cope when stress hits to avoid lighting up?

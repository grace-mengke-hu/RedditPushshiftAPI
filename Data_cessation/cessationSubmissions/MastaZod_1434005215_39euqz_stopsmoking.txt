I had a bad dream...

Here I am... 89 days. Going to sleep yesterday. I dreamt that I had smoke when I was drunk two weeks before... I feeled ashamed and depressed, don't deserving this 89 badge and had to start over all what I have already done...

Finally, it was just a dream, but I know what will happen if I stop quitting. Now, I'm sure that I will not fail, I'm a fighter !

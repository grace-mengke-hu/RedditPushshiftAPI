Ridiculously hard to sleep

I quit about 3 days ago and now I'm finding it incredibly hard to go to sleep. I work graveyard shift and usually go to bed around 5 a.m., but now I haven't been able to sleep until around 1 or 2 in the afternoon. So I go to bed at noon and wake up really late at night. I've tried melatonin, breathing techniques, warm milk, etc...

Anyone have any kind of advice or suggestion that could help me? I don't feel like myself anymore :(

Day Seven. This is easy, right?

So just out of the blue, the wife and I decided to quit.  We've both been smokers for 25 years, and I was easily at 2 packs a day, while she stuck to 1.  Got ahold of the COQuitline, got some patches, but also, I read a book, The Easy Way to Stop Smoking, by Allen Carr, which sounded really silly, but I haven't wanted a smoke yet after the book.  Haven't used the patch either.  I'm just  blown away, like maybe at my age I can just say, "no," and stop something?  Mind blown.   Sadly, the wife is always nagging for a cigarette, and keeps finging them around.

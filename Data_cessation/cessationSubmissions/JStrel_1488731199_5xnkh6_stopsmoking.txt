Is it coherent to transition from tobacco + ecigarette to only ecig with the help of patches ? All of this with the objective to finally end my nicotine addiction in the future.

I managed to stop smoking and vaping last year with the help of nicotine patches, unfortunately I forgot all my patches and my ecig at my parents' home 10 days into my withdrawal and went back to brown tobacco...


I still have 20 patches and can buy more but want to be sure the withdrawal will be worth it (ie lasts or decreases my consumption).

Consequently I'm considering this process :

Now: tobacco (5 to 20 cigs/day) + eliquid (12mg/ml);
Step 1: 1 patch/day + eliquid (12mg/ml);

Step 2, 1 month in: 1 patch/day + eliquid (6mg/ml);

Step 3, 2 months in: 1 patch/day;

Step 4, 3 months in: 0.5 patch/day

Final step, up to 6 months in: nicotine free.

Should I first decrease the amount of nicotine/ml or quit vaping completely before I use the patches ?

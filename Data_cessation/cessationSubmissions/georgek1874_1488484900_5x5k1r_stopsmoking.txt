8 Hours in... feel like death

I have been a smoker since I was about 14 or 15, I am now 18. At college today I decided to spontaneously quit smoking at lunch, so it has been roughly 8 hours since I had my last cigarette and the cravings are TERRIBLE.

I have tried to quit over 50+ times to no avail, the psychological craving for the cigarette always seems to get me.
My mind always seems to rationalise having a cigarette when I haven't had one in a while. 

Any advice would be appreciated ;I am still committed to giving up and living without the shackles of nicotine.

UPDATE: it's been about 10 hours now and I have developed a dull headache, cravings haven't subsided and  have only slightly decreased in intensity 

UPDATE: just woken up and cravings are still intense, it's been 19 hours now

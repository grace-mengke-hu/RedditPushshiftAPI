When will the coughing end?

I'm on day 15. Eight days ago I woke up with what I think was Bronchitis. It was really bad for about 3 days, but I've felt pretty good the last few days. The problem is: I can't stop coughing! I'm definitely coughing way less than I was, but still enough to be annoying to me. It seems to subside for a bit after I exercise and is worst when I'm laying down. I have no other residual symptoms of illness. Had anyone else experienced this? And if so, when will the coughing finally stop?

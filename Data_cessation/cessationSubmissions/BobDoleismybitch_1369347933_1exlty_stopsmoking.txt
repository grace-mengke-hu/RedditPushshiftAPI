I guess I just need some encouragement.

I'm in the military, and as it happens a vast majority of my unit smokes. This is what led to me picking up the habit in the first place. I always thought I could stop at a moments notice later in life. But there was a blizzard which left me trapped in my house for 3 days. Being a pack-a-day smoker, it was the first time I was completely cut off my smoking for an extended period of time. The withdrawals shocked me. I'd always had cravings, but usually I can occupy my time and ignore it. (Not an option without electricity/means of travel) The first cigarette I had immediately after the road was cleared gave me the most satisfyingly disgusting feeling of my life. I hated that I felt that way towards a substance. But time and time again when I try to quit, I might go a few days, but eventually, usually at work, I start again. Bringing only more self disgust at how weak-willed I am. I finished a pack around two hours ago and I'm trying to keep myself from going to the corner store. When will this get easier?

Edit: Usual mistakes.

I stopped smoking last year in January and didn't even think about it

I've been trying to stop smoking 3 times since I was 18. My father in law died last year and it was a rough time for my gf and me because he passed away suprisingly without being ill. Being healthy and being there to help my family and my gf is now really important to me. I just stopped buying cigarettes. If you want to quit you have to 100000% change your thought process when you smoke. It does nothing good for you

I think differently about life now. Smoking was just a thing to hold onto when I was bored. I don't miss it a second and I'm happy that I spend my money on cool stuff.

Just wanted to tell my short story how i stopped to smoke.
I hope you will stop too.

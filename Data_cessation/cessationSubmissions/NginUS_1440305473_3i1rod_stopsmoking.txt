Having _such_ a hard time quitting.

Hi,

I've been meaning to quit 'tomorrow', or 'when I run out'. And I always give in to the cravings a day or 2 later.

Right now I observed myself self-medicating, wanting a smoke b/c I'm distressed about quitting/running out.

I have so many worries, my life is in turmoil, thus my strength is low. I'm about to run out of food for the month w/o any means to go food shopping again, due to a lack of finances. Before food can become a priority, I have to come up with $20 to cover my cat's asthma medication, otherwise he has attacks that I can tell pain him.

I really should have saved my last $25, but smoking was on my mind, and I gave is like I always do. Now I hate myself for spending my cat's medicine money.

Please say a prayer for me.

Thanks,

-N

So ive been milking my last pack for about 4 days, now every time i smoke a short i feel soo sick.. why?

is this normal? or could it be something like me being pregnant?  even when i only take a couple puffs, my stomach churns, and this is new (past two days).... i havent missed my period yet or anything, so I'm hoping this is normal?

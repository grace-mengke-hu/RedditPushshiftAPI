Gave in to a craving...

On 20 days smoke free. But had intense cravings earlier, and had one cig. However after a few puffs I realized that I was gaining no real pleasure from it, and stubbed it out halfway through.
Feel bad for giving in, but at the same time, it was a realization that going back to that lifestyle isn't worth it.
I hope I don't give in again. I dont want to, I can't.
Here's to living as a non-smoker again ladies and gents!!!

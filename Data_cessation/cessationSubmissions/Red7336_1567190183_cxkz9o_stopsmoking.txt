I made a sub for people looking for someone to check in on them every once in a while

 [My Buddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBuddy/) is a community of kind Buddies checking in on eachother every now and then. Our goal is to make sure no one is left alone with their dark thoughts for too long.  
No pressure, no commitment, no need for small talk, just a simple message to/from your Buddy to make sure everything is going okay and no one is in a dark place by themselves

PS: The sub is mostly for heavy stuff (trauma, Eating disorders, abuse, addiction....etc)

so relationships, friendships, annoying coworkers, finances, children/ parents....etc (as hard as these things can be) do not belong on the sub.

This is mostly for survivors, depressed, suicidal, or isolated people that need to know that someone cares.

(I've mostly announced this sub on subs for mental illnesses, and since this is not one of them, I added this PS here so people know what to expect beforehand.)

Advice when around smokers

If you're trying to resist the urge to smoke and still hangout with smokers. I suggest you have something to keep you occupied while your friends smoke. I found it to be tremendously helpful to hold a bottle of water, chew some gum, even eat some sour candy instead of smoking. Also helps with other triggers like riding in a car or on ten minute breaks at work. I hope this helps! Keep up the good work everyone

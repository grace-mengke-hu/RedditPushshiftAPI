Stopping for a Week: How Do I Maintain It?

So I'll soon be going on vacation and for 10 days I will not be able to have a cigarette. I've made it a personal rule to never smoke around family members, and for ten days I will be constantly surrounded by family while on vacation. I've done it before where I've gone this long without smoking, but as soon as I get back from vacation I start up again.

I'm a bit of a hypochondriac. Every time I get a cough, or have a bit of pain somewhere I think that my smoking has caught up with me and I'm dying. I got to the doctor and he tells me it's just a cold or something innocuous and I'm not dying. He of course immediately chastises me for smoking. Good man. But I'm so tired of it. I just wanna quit and live my life without worrying about life-threatening ailments that I'm only increasing the chances of getting.

I tend to smoke at work and while I'm at certain bars. I intend to avoid those bars for a while as I avoid smoking, but it's become part of my routine for work. What can I do to prevent myself from starting up again once I get back from vacation? What replacement habits have worked for some of you all? What have you done to prevent yourself from smoking when that smoke break you've always taken has come around?

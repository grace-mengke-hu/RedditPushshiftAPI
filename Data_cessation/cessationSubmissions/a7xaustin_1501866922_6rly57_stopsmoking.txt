Smoking dreams (A question for the long term quitters)

Hi hi hello! Day 26 here, and it's been very easy for me. 

After the third day, it's been a piece of cake. 

However, this strange phenomenon has happened a few times now. 

Dreams of smoking, and then waking up and actually *feeling* a sort of withdrawal. 

The first time, I was smoking all day in my dream, and when I woke up, the rest of my day I was tired, edgy, and feeling like I was going through physical withdrawal again. 

I just woke up from a dream where I smoked a few cigarettes, and it feels as if my lungs are heavy right now, and I have that "morning craving" that I haven't had since after day 3 which is so peculiar! 

I'm not going to cave or anything, it's not like that. 

But my question is, long term quitters, have you had dreams or experiences like this? 

If so, have they lasted into the long term? 

What is your take on the experience? 

Also, I am grateful for your presence on this sub always helping perpetuate everybodies support/success! 

Thank you and have a spectacular day!

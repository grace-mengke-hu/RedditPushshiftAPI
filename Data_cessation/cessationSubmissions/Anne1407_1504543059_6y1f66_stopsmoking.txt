From patches to cold turkey

I quit three weeks ago today. I used the 14mg patches. Today, I decided to stop those. The feeling of having nicotine in my body at all times, is not what I want to experience. I bought pills of 1mg for when I have an enormous craving, but apart from that, I'll be going cold turkey. Wish me willpower.

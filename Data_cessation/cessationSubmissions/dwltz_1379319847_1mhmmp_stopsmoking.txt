Almost at three weeks

And I'm feeling great. I haven't really had any cravings, my mood is actually changing for the better right now, I feel more healthy and I'm spending less (and having more) money in my bank account than I've had in some time! This might be one of the best decisions I've ever made and so far just visiting and reading this sub has helped and inspired me a ton!

Today is my last day of smoking

Got a text from my sister that said my mom went to the Dr and they found spots on her left lung, it is still undetermined what it is and wonâ€™t know till end of next month. That being said I have decided to quit this habit in order to improve my health but also to show my mom support and hopefully she joins me quitting this garbage!

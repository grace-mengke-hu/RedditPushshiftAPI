Yesterday I was at the Kendrick Lamar concert. When we went outside at the end of the concert, a couple of my friends started smoking and didnâ€™t knew I was stopping. One of my friends offered me a cigaret, which I despite having some withdrawals rejected. Resisting can make you feel so much better!

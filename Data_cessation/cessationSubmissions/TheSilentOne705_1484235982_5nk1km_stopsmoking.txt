You know what I find to be the worst part right now?

The mood swings. They're so hard to deal with right now with work and personal projects. What do you do about it? I listen to post rock (alt-rock with little to no lyrics) and indulge my dietary desires, as well as work on my personal projects, but it's still really rough. I overslept for the first time in a long time today and had to drag myself out of bed.

So what do you do about yours?

EDIT: I took some advice from /u/sigh1987 and took a half-hour walk after lunch, which improved my mood a lot. Definitely recommend, and thanks /u/sigh1987!

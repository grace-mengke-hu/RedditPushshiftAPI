New Here! I want to quit! Have a few questions!

Hi Guys,

I am new to this subreddit and I am really looking forward to quit smoking. 

I have been smoking for the past 4/5 years. I smoke 1 pack per day and I am starting to worry about my health. 

I am 27 years old and I am very much looking forward to have a healthier and better life without smoking. 

I once quit for 7 days, I definitely felt better but I had some anxiety bursts through those days and I just gave up and started again. 

Here are a few questions:

1 - Are there any tips? Should I just stop and pray that I will be able to keep to the program?

2 - I am currently dealing with anxiety with a therapist. One of my main concerns is that when I quit, I would have my anxiety increased. Any ideas on how to deal with it? 

3 - One of my fears is gaining weight. Any suggestions on how avoiding gaining some extra few pounds?

Thanks for your attention! :)

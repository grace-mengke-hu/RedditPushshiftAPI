day 3 / 10 hours Free

Morning, Happy Tuesday!

2nd time quitter here (quit cigarettes back in 2012 haven't smoked till 2016, but picked up an ECIG)

Smoked Ecig (mostly juul &amp; other pod systems)
This month has been a weird month for me. I thought i was getting over a nasty cold, then had food poisoning. I had constant phlegm and irritation in my throat *it felt like my throat was closing in* I did some internet digging and i self diagnosed my self with ACID REFLUX / GERD. (Although my stomach it self doesnt burn my throat is constantly feeling pressure and gassy)

I read online that Nicotine relaxes the throat and can cause the acid to go back into the throat, so i decided it was tiem to quit. My mom's been telling me to quit, my wife's been telling me to quit. Day 3. Lat night i had a basketball game, and just couldnt get my self to focus. I felt anxious to get my day started and wondered what life would be like without my vape in the office. Here i am in the office writing this, its not too bad but i sure do miss it. I told my co-workers and i told them its just something i gotta get past and go through with. I want to live long for my wife, i want to have kids and see them grow up. One thing is through all this theres always a positive. I've gotten closer with my church, and have been praying more. I also am taking part in bible reading in the morning and just looking for God to guide me through this. 

I cant wait to look back at all this and laugh and see how much it has changed me. Time to GROW UP!

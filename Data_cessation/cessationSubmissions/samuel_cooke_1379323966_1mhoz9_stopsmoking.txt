Hopefully this time I can have the willpower to go through with it

I have being lurking this sub for a long time and reading all of your stories today has finally made me come to the conclusion that it has to end.

I started smoking at 13, this was mainly because my friends at the time were smoking so I though I would try to fit in by doing the same as them, the cigs were dirt cheap because there was a woman who would sell 20 cigs for Â£2 ( they were fake ) so at that age my spending money helped me buy my cigarettes.

Now I am 17 and I am hoping to go to university next year, I have come to the realization that there is no way I will be able to afford to keep up this horrible habit. Over the past week I have tried to quit, never made it past two days mainly due to parents still smoking or friends at college. Hopefully this time I can kick this pointless habit for good and I can make this 1 day badge into a 10 days badge, then a 50 day badge and hopefully one day it will be in the triple digits.

Sorry for the wall of text but I needed to get it off my chest.

Congratulations to everyone on this sub who have being able to kick it for good! Hopefully I will be able to soon.

Just went 3 days without a smoke, then broke it by having one

First time poster here, ive been smoking for about 4 years and have talked about quitting for too long. As title says i just had a smoke after 3 days smoke free and all i can say is that it makes you feel like shit. Im posting here because i dont want to stop smoking for a few days, i want to be permanant. Could someone please comment some tips or something that has helped you, anything will be appreciated. Thanks in advanced for taking the time read this and help. For all you still trying to quit im in the same boat as you and i hope it works out!

150 days?!!?

Holy crap it's been 5 months.

I caught myself the other week being disgusted by someone smoking. That was pretty cool.

I feel like I'm way more productive at work since I can concentrate more easily and not just living life one cigarette at a time.

Also, last week I started couch to 5k and tonight I did my best workout to date and felt great!

Thank you fine folks for the inspiration, support, and just the right words to go into my brain and tell me why what I was doing was so bad!

For those of you who are in your first couple of days: believe me when I say the pain is worth it. So, SO worth it.

I'll post again after my first 5k (second, actually, but I pretty much just walked the first one, so I don't really count it)

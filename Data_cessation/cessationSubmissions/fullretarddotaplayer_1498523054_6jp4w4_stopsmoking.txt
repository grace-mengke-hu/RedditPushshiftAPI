Hello. I'm gonna quit!

Hi. Must start saying I'm sorry if this goes against the sub rules (I couldn't find any) and also, sorry bout the bad english as it's not my first language.

So, I'm soon to be 24yo and have been smoking since 19. Used to be a casual smoker (1/day or sometimes only having one at parties/weekend). Started smoking 1 pack a day last year and mixed this shit with every other habit I have. Now I can't do any physical activity without having that cig after it. Can't drink without it. Can't game, can't chat in public places. 

It's eating a lot of my money and I just had a realization that all my clothes and stuff must stink cigarettes and my nose prob isn't working well as I can't notice it.

I have tried stopping before and I didn't feel anything in my body. Idk how to explain it, lets say mt body doesn't tell me it needs nicotine, its all about the habits mixed with smoking. I have no idea how to stop. Maybe get addicted onto something else? lol  I noticed I smoke less while gaming if I have a glass of water nearby but what about the other activities? Should I become a water addict? hahaha

Anyway, sorry about the rant. I'm having what I want to be my last one right now. Not gonna buy more and gonna carry a water bottle everywhere.

TLDR: I want to stop and would love tips! Gonna become a water addict.

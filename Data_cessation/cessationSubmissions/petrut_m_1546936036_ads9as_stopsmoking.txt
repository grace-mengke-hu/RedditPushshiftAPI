Here we go, again.

Currently on Day 2. 4th attempt in 10 years. This time my motivations are a little more forward looking, I want to be around to see my daughter grow up and get to have a part in all of the milestones she's going to reach. 

Approach: cold turkey, Tic-tac's as replacements when I get a craving, Don't give up rituals (Coffee)

From previous attempts I know the first 3 days and after 2 months are the breaking points for me. Usually It's after 2 months that I fail with the "It's OK if I have a smoke, I proved to everybody that I quit...."

Wish me wisdom and willpower.

I just wasted an entire week

I have smoked consistently since I was 16 years old. I am now 21 and I am done with it, but I am just unable to be done with it. I just absolutely love lighting up. The calming sensations, the familiar motions, the ability to just sit and relax and smoke. I love it all. But I also hate being a slave to my desires. In my life I want to climb mountains and sprint through trails. But it just doesn't seem like I can ever kick this fucking habit. 

How can I convince myself that I don't love to smoke? How can I just stop. Forever. Without that thought that I will eventually pick up another cigarette at some point, and suck down a full stick of calm. I don't know what to do or how to quit for good. 

I use the app, and I just blew 6 days, 19 hours, and 25 minutes of not smoking for two cigarettes. What do I do now?

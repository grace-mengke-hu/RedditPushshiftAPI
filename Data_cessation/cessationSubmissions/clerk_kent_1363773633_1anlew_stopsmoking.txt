It's been a month apparently

Hey, I've now stopped smoking for a month, and truth be told, I don't even miss it now. I had tried to stop before, but for some reason it's a whole lot easier this time around.

Thanks guys, I've loved coming here and seeing your positive words towards everyone else giving it a go. It's very motivating.

Now I'm trying to convince my mum she needs to quit too...

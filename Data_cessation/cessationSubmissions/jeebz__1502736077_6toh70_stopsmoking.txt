Stopsmoking, I need your help.

Facing another relapse now. Hit four months yesterday but also found out on the same day that my ex of three years is now dating another guy, less than two months after leaving me. 

Handling this very badly and my mind constantly keeps going back to chain smoking a pack of cigarettes in my car. That's how I've always dealt with grief and sadness and that's where my brain is taking me now. 

I'm feeling very, very low and tomorrow I'm going to work and scared I will crumble. The vape isn't cutting it atm.

Free camels

On one of my night walks that help me cope and sleep since I guess insomnia is one of my withdrawal symptoms. I see a pack of camels on the sidewalk. Pick it up. Almost full, only 1 or 2 missing!  I think of the poor sap who lost it. I threw it back on the ground. Didn't smoke any! One of my proudest moments, bring on day 7!

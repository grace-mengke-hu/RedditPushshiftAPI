Will nicotine-free e-liquid help for quitting smoking?

So I broke down today and smoked a cigarette for the first time in over 3 days. Recently I've been looking into e-cigs, and found a lot of nicotine-free liquids that seem appealing. I've heard if there's a higher PG level you'll get more of a throat hit, and that combined with a tobacco flavor seems favorable. But does anyone have any experience with that? You think it'd help? Thanks in advance! :^)

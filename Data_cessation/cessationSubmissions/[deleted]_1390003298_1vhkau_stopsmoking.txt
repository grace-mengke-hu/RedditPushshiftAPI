I REALLY want to quit.

So, i  just had a eureka moment. I'm happy. With my life, my girlfriend, everything. 

I use smoking as a crutch because i have certain mental disorders, and i feel like it relieves stress.

But this is nothing in comparison to what i could have if i quit. I have a future planned with my girlfriend, we're getting engaged in 6/7 months. I don't want to be the guy who promises his life to someone and goes and smokes it away, leaving her on her own in her old age while i'm lying dead/dying because of me being selfish right now.

I also wanna stop because i know i'm stronger than that. I honestly want to quit because when i look at everything i could have, smoking is nothing in comparison. I want to be healthier, i want to lose weight (i'm already counting calories and eating well, etc). 

I currently have 5 smokes left out of a pack of 10, which i won't lie, i will be finishing. But after that i wanna cut down and eventually quit. I don't wanna die and leave my family in tears. I don't wanna die and leave my SO distraught. I don't wanna have kids for them to look me in the eye and ask me if daddy is going to die. 

I would like any advice you could give because i am so fucking done with killing myself. I just want help.

A Very Vivid Dream

Last night at a small NYE party, I had the worst craving I'd had in quite a while. Being 8 months in, it doesn't happen much any more. It might have been spurred by a 'friend' of mine/old smoking buddy offering me a cigarette despite knowing how long I've been quit. (I think she tries to sabotage due to jealousy--she wants to quit as well, and feels like it's unfair my quit was so 'easy'--it wasn't, she just didn't see the hard parts).

Well last night I had my first smoking dream in a while. But unlike the others, where you wake up feeling guilty until you realize it was all made up, in this one I knew it was a dream. I looked at the cigarette in my hand and thought "This is stupid. Don't waste 8 months." And then I thought "Well, it's just a dream. It doesn't even exist. You can smoke it if you want to. Just ennnnjooooy it." So I did.

Thanks, subconscious me. ðŸ™„ Everyone else posting about how their dream self says no to cigarettes, and here's mine trying to game the system. I should reset my counter just to spite the bastard.

Happy New Year everyone! Here's to my first smoke free year in a decade. May all your cravings be managable and all your friends be supportive, and may you triumph even if they're not.

after 30 years i quit. bout time. feels like stepping of a ledge.

Hello quitters, glad to join youze.
Feeling sorta dazed, marshmallow brain.
I feel like my neurotransmitters are like these blind newborn birds in a nestconstantly chirping for food. 
anyway.
I must say that this community helped me make the 1st step.
So, thanks and keep on quitting !

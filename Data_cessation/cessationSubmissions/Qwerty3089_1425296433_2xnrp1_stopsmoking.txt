Second day as a non-smoker

So, after smoking for the past 20+ years I've decided to quit for good. I've had many failed attempts in the past but I really feel good about this one. This subreddit support system is hopefully the missing link I need as the vast majority of my friends are all smokers.

I was sick of nasty smelling breath, car, hands, clothes, etc and constantly making decisions that revolved around smoking. The long term health effects has also been weighing on me for quite some time. I'm using the patches to wean myself off and so far so good. I've had a few small moments of weakness but searching google for images of smoking related illnesses does an amazing job of curbing it lol. 

I also have a wonderful girlfriend that's being very supportive and dealing with my tantrums like a champ lol

So yeah... Anyway, thanks for participating in this subreddit. Reading through the posts here has been very inspiring and it's great that you all support one another. 

I do have one major concern though and perhaps you guys/girls can give me some advice or tips... What do YOU do in social situations with alcohol involved? That's always been a rough one for me... Even as a smoker lol (smoking like a chimney)

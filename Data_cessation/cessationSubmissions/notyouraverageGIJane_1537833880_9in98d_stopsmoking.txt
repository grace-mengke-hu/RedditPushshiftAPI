LPT: Check if your work has a quit smoking program!

My work (like many places I have worked at before) offers a quit smoking program as one of my benefits. It is a stand alone benefit but my health insurance also offers a similar program. 

They offer a lot of things, but most specifically, it pays for your quitting method, whether that be a pill subscription or patches or gum etc. For example, the pills cost about $300 since insurance doesn’t cover them, patches run ~$60 every two weeks and gum is another $50-$60 for 120 pieces iirc. Meaning that quitting smoking can be a HUGE investment and the one thing that always stopped me before was not being able to come up with 2 weeks worth of cigarettes money on one day considering how I am paid. 

With this program, I am staring at 8 weeks worth of patches and another 120 pieces of gum that was shipped to me at no cost. I also have someone I can call when the need gets to be too real of wanting to smoke who can offer me alternatives or just listen to me bitch and moan if I need it. 

I can say I’m 5 days in and with the help of this program and some long over due determination, I think I have this beat.

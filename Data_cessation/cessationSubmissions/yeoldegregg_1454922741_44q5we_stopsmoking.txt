Day one

Quitting cold turkey today (or, when I wake up since it's 1am here haha). Over the years I've had a few attempts at quitting for good but have always fallen into the habit again.
I'm very motivated to quit because this time it's for me: not for anyone else, a new boyfriend, nobody.

Wish me luck!

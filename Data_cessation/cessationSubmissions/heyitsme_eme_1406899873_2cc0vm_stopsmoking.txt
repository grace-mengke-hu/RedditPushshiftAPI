I am scared, but it just makes me want to smoke more.

I'm looking for advice, encouragement, anything really.

I'm 24 and I've been smoking since I was ~15. It's been mostly menthols, and about a pack a day (less when I am less stressed of course) and I WANT to quit. I look at pictures of cancerous lungs and hear stories of people who have had major problems from smoking, and it terrifies me like you wouldn't believe, sometimes to the point of tears. However for some reason, it makes me want to step outside and smoke another and I have no idea why. I've tried almost everything you can think of to slow down/ stop smoking, and it just doesn't help.

At the beginning of last year, I found out that I was pregnant. I quit cold turkey that day, and had no problems for a little under 9 months. When my daughter was 10 days old, after a few days of craving a cigarette, I gave in and had one. Now, I'm back to square one. I can't just stay pregnant for the rest of my life to ensure that I will not smoke! (FYI: I do not smoke in the house or in the car, or anywhere that my daughter can see.)

I hate the smell, I hate the taste, I hate the feeling, I hate what I know it will do to me if I don't stop, ASAP. Any advice, encouragement, or recommendations are welcome. I just really want to quit, for myself and for my family.

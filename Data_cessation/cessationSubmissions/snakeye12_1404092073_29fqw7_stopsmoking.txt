Day 0- Confindence Destroyed

I'm temporary living in a new city where I got my first blue collar job. Blue collar workers love to smoke and being around it has exacerbated this disgusting habbit. I went from 2-3 cigarettes to over half a pack in a day. A few hours ago I was sitting at a stop light with my window cracked smoking. This car rolls up next to me and this cutie rolls down her window in the passenger seats and looks at me wanting to say something. Her friend says something I can't hear but I hear her reply. "I saw a cigarette!" And rolls up the window. I've been wanting to quit for a while but nothing really pushed me to do it until that moment. This shit is not worth it.

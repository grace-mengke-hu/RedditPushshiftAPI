Cravings down!

I have been struggling with cravings, as is expected. It was lovely yesterday because it wasn't until about 9 p.m. that I had my first craving! I was driving in my car, one of the places I used to smoke, when I had a craving. It lasted only a few seconds and then I was reminded of how disgusting my car smells because I used to smoke in it. I'm getting it detailed soon to get rid of that smell.

Has anyone had success with taking vitamins to help with smoking cessation?

Hi everyone! I’ve been trying to quit the last 2 weeks with the help of a vape, this subreddit and Allen Carr. The vape has helped as well as the book but I’m still smoking around 3 cigarettes a day. 

It’s a huge improvement from a pack a day but still. I was doing some googling last night and found some posts on Reddit about taking a supplement called NAC to aid in quitting. Short for 
n-acetylcysteine. The post I found was from 2014. 

Was just curious if anyone was familiar with it or knows of something I can take to give me the boost I need.

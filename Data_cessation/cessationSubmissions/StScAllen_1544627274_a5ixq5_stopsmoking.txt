Interesting data on success rates.

I found a study showing how your odds of quitting improve the further you make it.  I took the data and made a chart with various milestones on it.  The original paper only provided data points for certain intervals (shown in peach) I estimated the remaining buckets (in blue).  I think there is some fascinating information in here.  

For instance, if you look at month 3 something amazing happens.  You switch from odds against to odds for.  To put it lyrically: At three months... **every bookie in Vegas would put money down on your success.**Â  Or another angle, Card counters have worse odds (51%) than you do!  Making it 3 months is HUGE.  
There is some more fascinating stuff in there but I didn't want to ramble. I did a mini blog on it here if you are interested.

I'd love to hear any analysis you have from the data.  The actual paper is cited at the bottom of the chart if you are interested.

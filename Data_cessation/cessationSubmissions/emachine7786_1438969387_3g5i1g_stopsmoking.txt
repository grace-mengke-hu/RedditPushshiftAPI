I didn't quit, I escaped!

I've been listening to Allen Carr's book all day today at work. If you haven't read it yet, you really should. I especially liked that he said we aren't quitting smoking, we're escaping it's grasp. Also, highly recommend the Audible book, nothing like a soothing British accent telling you to escape smoking. :-)

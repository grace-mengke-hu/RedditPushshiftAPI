Relapsed after 2 Months!

I quit smoking on 1 November 2018 and everything was good, but this New Year’s eve, I had a really strong urge to smoke and idk what happened, I borrowed one and smoked. I smoked a couple of ciggs that night as I went out, but the next day I woke up, I was really frustrated and angry at myself! 

But the good part is that i’m 6 days smoke free again and have no cravings(so far). I hope I don’t relapse again!

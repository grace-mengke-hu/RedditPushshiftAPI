4 hours from 5 days :)

I feel like I really have this now. I get a craving every once in a while, but I know I don't want to smoke anymore. Had a really stressful past couple of days but didn't smoke.

I paid off 2 credit cards so that makes me even more excited. It's FREEZING outside and windy, and I'm so happy I don't feel the need to go out there. I'm extra happy because I want to leave this habit in 2018, and I'm actually doing something about it. 

I remember when I'd say that I'm quitting, and feel really stupid because I couldn't get past the first two days. I did this several times. I felt like "Oh, I only made 1 day. Oh, I only made it 2 days" "Everyone must think I'm a joke". But really, that's a triumph in itself. One day leads to the next. Don't feel bad that your number is small, just keep going. 

Really grateful for this Reddit Community &lt;3
You guys and gals are awesome. :)

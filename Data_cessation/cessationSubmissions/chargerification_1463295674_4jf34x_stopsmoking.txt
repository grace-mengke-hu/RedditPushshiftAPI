Pure Abstinence

I was fanatical about weed smoking, onsentatiously so. Eventually picked up cigarettes and a few other things along the way. Quit everything else entirely, 9 months off addictive drugs including alcohol. Cigarettes were a tough one but fighting tooth and nail with myself will have to be what i do, to keep my teeth and nails. Nothing qualms stress like a late night cigarette, just had my last one after coming down off acid. Hoping its my last nail in a coffin i made too many many nail holes for but always kept them hollow. Deep breaths and water. Flair me up 1st day

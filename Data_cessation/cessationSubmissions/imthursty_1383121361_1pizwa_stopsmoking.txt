I think its time, where do i start?

I'm new to reddit, stumbled accross this subreddit, as a smoker of 4 years i think i am starting to really recognise what smoking is doing to me, ive tried a few times before, without any support at all really, 
the past times ive tried ive just gone cold turkey, is this the way to go?
i smoke around a packet a day, 19 years old, very stressful life...
any help would be greatly apreciated on how to start.. and ofcourse other peoples storys do help.
on a side note, if i have posted this wrong i apoligise... agan, new to reddit.

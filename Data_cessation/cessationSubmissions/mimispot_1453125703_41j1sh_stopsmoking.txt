Sleep deprivation makes me spend money

One of the side effects of not smoking is of course saving money unless you are the CEO of Phillip Morris. But then again if you are the CEO of Phillip Morris: you are the reason I hope there is a hell.
But one other thing that I noticed was that I am having a much easier time regulating my sleep patterns: I can go to sleep or stay awake much more easily and feel like I am much more in tune with my body. And did anyone ever notice that sleep deprivation leads to reckless spending? It totally does and it's quite mindblowing. So in addition to the money saved from not smoking, I saved money because I'm less reckless and I also saved money from quitting drinking because I dont want to expose myself to alcohol just yet.

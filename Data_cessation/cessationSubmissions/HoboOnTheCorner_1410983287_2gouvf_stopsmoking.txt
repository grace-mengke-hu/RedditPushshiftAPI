It's time, but I need some advice.

I have been smoking a pack a day for almost ten years now. On monday I smoked 1 cigaratte. yesterday i smoked a half. The problem is this morning i woke up and felt pretty sick. Like really loopy kinda twitchy and very nauseas. So I smoked a whole cigarette already. (I just woke up) I guess my question is: Is this an effective way to quit? Or should i really just buck up and suffer through withdrawals. 

I have had terrible anxiety the past three days and it has been awful. 

anyone have any tips on dealing with the anxiety?

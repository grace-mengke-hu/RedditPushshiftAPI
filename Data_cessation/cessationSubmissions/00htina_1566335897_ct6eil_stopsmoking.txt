Drinking ended my smoke free streak

I was doing so well and then drinking with friends lead to smoking a pack in two days. I had been a month smoke free! 

I just have to avoid drinking around people who I know who smoke for a bit longer because I can drink and not want a cigarette but if I’m drinking and someone I know has one I get a craving. And that’s literally the only time! 

I’m so disappointed in myself!

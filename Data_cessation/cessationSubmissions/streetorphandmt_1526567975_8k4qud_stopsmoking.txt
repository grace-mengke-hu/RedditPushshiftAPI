What's the best advice you could give to someone about to quit?

Been smoking at least a pack a day for about 10 years. I hate it. I need to quit for good. Over the past couple days I've cut down substantially. 3 days ago I had 10. 2 days ago 5. Yesterday was 7. I'm currently smoking my first one today right now. Normally by now I'd be half way through a pack. 
I can't do vapes or patches or anything. I've tried them before and they actually make it worse.
I feel like I'm making progress but it's so fucking tough. I stopped drinking alcohol and coffee so I won't be triggered.
What else would you recommend?

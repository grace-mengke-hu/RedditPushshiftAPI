Work stress + interpersonal conflict = CRAVINGS

I have a new co-worker. We've been working together just long enough that I have begun to get hints of her particular kind of crazy. I've tried to be nice, but last week she called me and was extremely upset (and quite rude) about something that is, truly, an insignificant, minor annoyance. She wanted emergency attention to the "problem," and I didn't have the time to give it to her. Then I told her not to yell at me when she's mad about something unconnected with me. So then we didn't work together for three days. Today, we work together, and whoa, she's pissed. Won't return a good morning, cuts me off when I am trying to politely convey information relevant to our workday. It hits me tonight that she is saving it all up for our staff meeting tomorrow, with our boss. Panic. She's new, but also above me in the org chart, although not my direct boss. I think my boss will back me up, but you can't be sure. I hate this kind of thing. 

I am so irritated and anxious. I want so badly to just have a smoke, relax about all this, and go to bed. I just have to keep telling myself that neither this woman nor this job are worth getting cancer over.... Right? Can't let her mess with my nine-day streak....

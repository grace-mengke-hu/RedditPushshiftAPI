Stopped on Christmas and bought a pack again today

I've been following this subreddit for quite some time and I successfully had managed to stop smoking for over a year before and then fell right back into it.  I'm a 28 year who was silly enough to pick the habit up when I was 24. I smoke about 10 a day and to be fair I never realised the hold cigarettes have over me. It is the feeling of complete powerless that I do not like. Not smoking since Christmas Eve was so easy because I was at my parents and the fear of them realising I'm a smoker always outweigh the need for nicotine. My problem is that when I get home and back into my old routine I go buy a pack. Today I justified it because I was stuffing my face with everything I could get my hands on and I told myself I'd rather be a smoker than a fatty boom boom. Yet I managed to stay clear from buying a pack until I got home and a friend called me for a good old chinwag. We always light up during those conversations and sadly I crumbled when she said that I'm not fooling anyone and I should just buy a pack. I smoked 4 already out of a pack of 10. My boyfriend has asma and he's been so supportive of me quitting now I'll have to confess. He'll be back in town on Sunday. I'm going to try again and honestly speaking I'll probably will finish this pack tonight. Any words of encouragement are very much appreciated.

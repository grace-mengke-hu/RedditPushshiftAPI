10.5 days and still going strong!!!

Don't get me wrong this is not "easy" by any means. There have been a few times this last week that I've really wanted one. Each time I focused my thoughts on wanting to be healthy. I have started walking with the dogs longer every day, several times a day actually. My workout session with my personal trainer was a lot stronger this week. I had a lot fewer thoughts of quitting the workout session early this week. 

TLDR: Mood is improving, Motivation is Improving

For those with > 10 days, Thank you for your advice..
For those with < 10 days, Stick with it.. remember why you quit!!

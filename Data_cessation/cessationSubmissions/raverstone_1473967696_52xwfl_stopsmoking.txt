165 Days, but...

Hi guys, first time posting here, so today is my 165 Days since i stop smoking.
But since 2 weeks ago i got some personal problem and i smoked a cigarette while drinking 2 days ago. To be honest the taste don't delight me anymore, taste so bad already.
But i am affraid one cigarette could lead to smoking again. until now i feel no urge to smoke at all (which i found it great)
What do you guys think about this. i don't wanna start again but feel really guilty to myself at the moment.

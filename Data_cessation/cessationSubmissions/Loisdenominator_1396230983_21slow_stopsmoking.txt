Mad Men starts in 2 weeks, onscreen smoking at its best

I was getting worried because I was under the impression I had quit after the last season ended. I looked it up and it turns out that the finale episode was June 23, 1 full day after my quit date (or day 2, at night).

My memory sucks evidently, but I'm pretty impressed with myself realizing that I watched the show in the full throes of withdrawal and not only did I survive it, I was not even traumatized by it.

Bring on season 7!

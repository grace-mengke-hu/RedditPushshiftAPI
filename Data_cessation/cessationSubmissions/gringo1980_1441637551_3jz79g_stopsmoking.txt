Well, I failed

My girlfriend and I were going to stop smoking together.  She quit about 3 weeks ago, and she hasnt complained about it and it hasn't bothered her like it has me.  She just goes on not smoking, I am envious of that.  I have kept it up in secret while she went on smoke free.  Yesterday around noon was my last one of my last pack, so I tried to make it my last one.  She left to run some errands and the craving just over came me and I went to get some more.

The problem is, I feel so bad, because not smoking wasn't even that bad.  When people quit on tv they are up all night and their eyes are blood shot and they are going crazy.  It was really nothing more than a little anxiety.  No headaches, no bloodshot eyes and going crazy, just a little anxiety, and I feel pretty shitty since I just gave in to something so little.

Guess I will try again another time.

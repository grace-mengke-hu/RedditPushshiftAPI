Forgot my patch today.

I am rounding out my third step of patches, only a week and a half left. And I just now noticed I forgot to put it on this morning. This happened once before on step one and that was a lot worse. I will finish my course of treatment, because I want to be successful, but I will not put on a patch today. And I also will not smoke. Come too far.

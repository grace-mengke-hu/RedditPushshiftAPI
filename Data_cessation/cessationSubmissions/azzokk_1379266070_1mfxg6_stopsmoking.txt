Currently 8 days in and feeling great!

Hey all, 

I quit eight days ago after taking a good hard look at why I was smoking in the first place.  Little history, I have quit many times in the past and it always felt like a struggle I was never going to win, and within six months to a year I was back to smoking.  This time I really feel like I am ready to be done with this and move forward, it feels good to be a non-smoker again.  

I only had a couple of days of physical withdraw symptoms some irritability and cravings, but now I am feeling better about the whole thing.  

I think what made the difference for me is I quit while I was on vacation, and had time to just chill, or keep my hands busy during the withdraw pangs.  Low stress, lots of family around to give me some encouragement, and able to focus on the reasons I am doing this.  

The hardest time I have had so far is at work, I miss my little smoke breaks, but I do realize that I get more done at work because I try to keep myself focused on the job at hand.  

Anyways yay for me, will try to toss some more updates out when I hit a new milestone.

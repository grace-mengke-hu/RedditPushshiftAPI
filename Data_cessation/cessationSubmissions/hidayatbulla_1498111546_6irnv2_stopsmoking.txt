Today's the day. I'm done.

I've been smoking for almost ten years and have wanted to quit since then. But unfortunately, I'm what you'd call a serial quitter. The longest I'd gone without smoking was three days, thanks to Alan Carr's book. But of course, I couldn't stick to it. Cigarettes have taken away so many things from me, and yet I continue smoking. But not anymore. I'm done. I'm going to go have one last smoke and then get myself a badge. I'm posting this here so I know I have the support of all of you wonderful people. 

So here's to a fresh start in life. :)

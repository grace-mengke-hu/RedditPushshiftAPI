Holy shit I made it a day... holy fucking shit...

So I've been lurking and posting here a bit from time to time, and never have been able to make it past a day. Well, here I am! Yesterday I had a fat bowl of weed and did what I normally do afterwards, smoke a cigarette at exactly 7:00PM, knowing that the next day (today) while I was at work dreading not having a cigarette, I would know that as soon as I clock out for the day at 7PM that that would be one whole day.

Well, it worked. I cleaned up my ash tray (a cup), threw away all reminders, and just started smoking weed in my bathroom instead of my patio, because the patio reminds me of where I would smoke ciggs. Plus, weed doesn't make my bathroom smell, where as I'm sure ciggs would. Anyways, I had a great night getting really high in my bathroom and playing games lol and subbing ciggs for snacks, then today at work I just tried not to think about it. I made sure to pack plenty of snacks, and when I felt things were slipping, when I felt like I was considering smoking, I took a few deep breaths and got out of my chair. Going to the bathroom, even if I didn't need it, drinking some water, splashing water on my face, all helped. I am now 24 hours and 19 minutes free from cigarettes! HOLY FUCK SHIT BALLS.

Help With Nicotine Gum: Namely, Is There Anything That Doesn't Taste Like Satan's Own Infernal Taint?

I'm trying to quit, going slowly (I'm also in the process of quitting drugs and drink so cigarettes aren't the top priority; yet I'm still giving them attention when I can spare it), and have a box of Nicorette gum. I bought the box months, maybe even a year ago. 

Now, I remember the gum tasting stale and generally acrid, but now it seems especially bad. I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that I've had the gum for so long -- is there an expiration date on this shit?

Regardless, the gum always has and still does taste like a mossy pile of garbage that has been left in a moderately-well-lit room at room-temperature. I can't fuck with that. The first second or so is/are okay, but then everything goes to shit, and I'm stuck gnawing on a stale, flat, nasty glob of stickiness.

So, in summation, or, **tl;dr**: Is there any nicotine gum that doesn't taste like shit -- or, better yet, that tastes *good*? Thanks in advance for the help, everyone.

Update: Down but not out. What I've learned

Not sure if my flair has updated but here's my last [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/84lm3y/didnt_realize_i_passed_the_2_month_mark/?st=jfot804a&amp;sh=9923833e)

# What's Happened

1. The Juul got way to expensive for me, spending *$20* every *two* days.    

2.  I bought a pack. Got halfway through and the moment the 10th one hit my mouth I may have vomited a little. 

3. The smell was absolutely overbearing, people at work immediately knew I fell off the wagon.

4. My boss came from a family of smokers (I didn't) and let me know he was proud of going those three months without actual boges. 

5. Then the coughing. Started back up immediately. 

# What I've Learned

1. You find support from people you really don't expect, support is there if you look for it. 
2. I've gained a few pounds since quitting, but how is being not able to breathe going to help me when I put on my running shoes
3. People notice you're a smoker. Don't pretend no one will notice like I've done for years.
4. Maybe the massive nicotine content in the juul just made not not want boges? Or maybe a bit of the [Garcia Effect](https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Garcia+Effect)?
5. You may be down, but you're never out

I just ran out of smokes. Been cutting way down, sometime 4 a day, unless it's a crappy day. Should I go get some?

I really don't want one, but I will at 6:30 Am with my coffee and it will be cold as hell at 6:30 and a PITA to walk to the store. I think I am getting COPD, sometime I wheeze and my throat is sore. I smoke American Spirits and become panicked when I run out. I have stopped so many times, last time for a year. I started a new job and the smoking area is outside my office. The smell made me want one so bad I finally gave in, now I have smoked for one more year. I am quitting this job (way too much stress, no wonder all the x smokers start again when they work here) but don't want to wait until I quit the job to quit smoking, I can't quit until May 16th. 
Tell me something to help me quit.

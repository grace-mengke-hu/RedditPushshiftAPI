Day 3 confession and struggle

I am on day 3 and this has been more helpful than anything else. I can be honest in my comments and thoughts about quitting smoking. And I have some crazy ones. That's the addiction speaking I know that but still somewhat shameful. I.e. Boyfriend is not a smoker we met and I never hid it or anything but as time went on I think he was over it and has been bugging me to quit to save money and my health so he doesn't have to die alone etc. and I've wanted to quit for a while because at 10.11 a pack in PA I have way better ways to spend my money. So multiple attempts and restarts in the last couple months and here we are. One of the craziest thoughts has been if boyfriend and I broke up and he moved out then I could be at peace and left alone with my smoking. How insane is that?!? I feel guilty just thinking that especially in the face of being told I love you and i want you live longer so we can grow older together- and I'm secretly fantasizing about being alone so I can smoke? Ugh. I feel crazy and like my emotions are out of whack. I am oddly calm this go around (either 3rd or 4th attempt in the last 6 months) but I have moments of insane thoughts and just absurdness. I feel less like myself without smoking like I am giving up a part of me.

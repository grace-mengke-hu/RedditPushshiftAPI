I have been through a bunch of shit......but not once did i smoke

So I have been smoke free for about 9 and a half months now. Just in the past month, I've had to move out of my hoarder mother's house and tell her that she is dead to me because she values her possessions more than the son that was willing to try to help her. I had to move into a friend's house for the time being just to avoid the homeless shelter, or sleeping on the train. I don't even have enough money in the bank account to be able afford a room for rent with a shared kitchen and bathroom. I'm afraid that at anytime, I could be asked to leave because the landlord doesn't allow people to stay in my friend's house for overly extended periods of time. Also, the fiancee that I'm trying to bring to the country hasn't been exactly been supportive of my fragile emotional state and has had the attitude of "just build a bridge and get over it." Trust me, with all I have been through, if I were to build that bridge, I'd be the first one to jump off of it. Yeah, I've probably been drinking more than I should be, but not once did I think about picking up a cigarette. With all the things that have gone wrong in my life, at least I could do one thing right.

Stay strong. You can do this.

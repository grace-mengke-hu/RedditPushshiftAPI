7 days

Finally quit last Sunday with the help of patches and nicotine spray.  I barely think about cigs during the day but the craving is worst 1st thing in the morning and last thing at night and doesn't seem to be getting any less despite changing my routine to take my mind off the urge.
Anyone have any tips please?

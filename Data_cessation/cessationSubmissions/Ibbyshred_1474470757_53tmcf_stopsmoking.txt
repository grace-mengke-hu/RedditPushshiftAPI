Nicotine patch leaking?

So I've smoked for 15 years and I've tried to quit numerous times. I'm using the Nicoderm CQ 21mg patches now and I've been good for 3 days already. Surprisingly I haven't had a single urge to smoke and I'm pretty confident if I can use the patches as suggested I'll be able to finally kick the habit. However, this is my 3rd day using the patch and I think it's leaking? I can feel the area of the skin around the patch feels cold / wet so, I'll push my shirt down on the patch/skin. Once I do this I can feel with my fingers the shirt is wet. I just smelled the area and it actually smells similar to E-juice. 

Has anyone experienced this before? I'm at work, I don't have another patch or cigarettes with me. I'm worried about taking it off. I'm also worried about keeping it on, I'm getting the liquid on my clothes, I've gotten it on my hands & then typed all of this so it's on my mouse and keyboard. I can't find anything about this online. Some advice / opinions would be great.

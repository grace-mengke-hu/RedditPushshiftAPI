Stomach ache and bloatedness after quitting and moving to ecig

Hey folks,

13 days without an analog cigarette. I tried cold turkey but it wasn't for me, so I picked up with an ecig and have been using that for about 10 days now. 

Since then I've been having real nasty stomach pains, bloatedness and gassyness. 

I wanted to ask if this is a symptom of simply stopping smoking analogs or more likely due to the eCig? 

I really don't wanna go back to analogs but holy shit this is painful. 


Thanks in advance

Getting sick may have done it for me.

Have tried many times to quit.  Have patches and ecig.   
Have read Allen Carr's book.    
But going to the store to buy some food always seems to do me in.  

 It is so easy to ask the clerk for a pack at checkout.  
Haven't made it past 24 hours until now. (2 days).   
Caught a bad cold two days ago, haven't had a cig since..   
 Sick enough that I haven't gone out to the store, so that temptation is gone.    
 It helps that I can't taste or smell anything, and  the ecig just
makes me cough.    
  I had a chance a few years ago after a motorcycle accident landed me in the hospital for a week.  They used nic patches,
and I didn't have any thoughts or cravings (or opportunity, with
 a broken leg I couldn't go anywhere).      
Kicked myself many times  after smoking what was left of a   
pack when I got home, off to the races and back on the   
treadmill of a  pack a day.
 This time is it !!!!!!!

Itches

It itches,
I sit here, 
twiddling my fingers,
tapping my feet,
clenching my teeth.

It itches,
that needling sensation,
under my skin,
in my bones,
crawling inside my head.

It itches
Do it,
don't do it,
you want it,
you hate it.

It itches,
gnawing,
scratching,
out of reach.
smiling,

It itches.

What do you think is the best way to get someone to stop?

I know that it's a sentiment almost impossible to communicate to others, and that you are the only one who can help yourself quit. I know that. Have you ever actually helped someone to stop or to consider stopping?. Do you think you were helped by someone else, with or without their knowledge or intention? Tell me your experiences please.

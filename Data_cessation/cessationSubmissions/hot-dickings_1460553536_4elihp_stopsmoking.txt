Almost at 6 months and...

I'm no longer fighting the battle against the *enemy* aka *cigarettes*, but right now I'm just fighting a battle against *me*.

I've hit a point of normalcy where I crave them for nostalgia, or as if I have 100% control over my addiction. It comes in waves. I didn't experience this after my initial 90 days were up, so I have no clue what's different. I guess I've forgotten how horrible cigarettes are, and my brain only wants to remember how good they were. I miss the sensation of smoking, I miss the social part of smoking, but I don't miss being a smoker. I have no intent to jeopardize my progress so I don't need advice on fighting the cig cravings, I just want to stop wanting to smoke. :-(

I know there's not much else I can do to remedy these cravings, but they're really aggravating. I smoke in my dreams a lot, which is also really annoying. It's always the same.. someone offers me a cig, I say "Yes! Why not?" I smoke one, it feels awesome.. then I realize I've ruined my progress and I'm a big phony. The dreams kind of weigh on me when I wake up...

**For those 6+ months into it, are you still experiencing these waves of "nostalgic cravings" or does it eventually go away?**

Day 29, hardest challenge yet

Last week has been really easy, but today I got an insane craving after class this morning. Was sitting in my room for a solid hour just contemplating using some of my roommates dip, trying to rationalize it to myself like "I've already quit, putting a single lip in isn't going to hurt anything". Ended up with the can in my hand twirling it for 10 minutes, but the idea felt completely wrong though, and now it's passed and I feel like a normal abstinent person again.


Remember not to let your success be your downfall. The first week is easier in my opinion because you know it's going to be tough and you can power through it with enough willpower, but once you believe you've already quit, you start trying to justify how a single smoke or dip won't do any harm. 

The feeling I have now knowing I have the power to be completely tobacco free for myself and my family, and will continue to be, is better than any fucking cheap buzz I can get off these cancer leaves.

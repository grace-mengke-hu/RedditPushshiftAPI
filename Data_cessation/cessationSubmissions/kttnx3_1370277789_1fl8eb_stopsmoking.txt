I've done horrible...

I can't even go a whole day without a cig. I tried to yesterday and ended up yelling at my 7.5 month old. :(  She's getting a new tooth(which makes 4 coming in at the same time) and is super cranky. I get so frustrated when she cries for hours a day. It's hard to console her when she's in pain.

I've cut down to a like 5 a day at the most. I just want to be down to zero but I don't want to yell at my daughter. :(

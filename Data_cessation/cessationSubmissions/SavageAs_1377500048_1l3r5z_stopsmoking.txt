I guess I'll just quit now

Until this moment, I was planning to quit in two weeks.

I woke up today with one cigarette left and no money and I'm quite sure I would have bought a pack if I had extra money. I decided to just embrace the opportunity and suck it up.

I made it through day one. I'm expecting it to get worse tomorrow and to be the worst on day 3 before it gets better.

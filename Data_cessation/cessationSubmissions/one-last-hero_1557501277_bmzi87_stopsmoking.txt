Three years ago today I quit smoking, it’s been a tough journey but it was worth it! To everyone who’s struggling: Stay strong! You can do it!

I’m at a loss for words, but I’m grateful for that decision that changed my life even if it’s not that much of a change. I’m glad I took that step and quit smoking for good.

The journey continues, 1095 days and it’s still counting!

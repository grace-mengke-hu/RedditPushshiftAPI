I'll be in great temptation tomorrow, and just a thank you for this 5 days of help everyone.

I am going to be in huge danger of smoking tomorrow, I am going out with a friend with who I started smoking, and we always smoke when we are together and he isn't very helpfull with my quiting attempts, since he always tell me go smoke one when ever I quit. And also, saturday is smth like my smoke day, tradition to buy my favorites and you know rest. Just wanted to share with someone, I find this subreddit so incredibally helping I can't thank you enough.

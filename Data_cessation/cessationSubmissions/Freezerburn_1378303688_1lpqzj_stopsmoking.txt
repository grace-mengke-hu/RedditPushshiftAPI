Looks like day 27 and doing fine without tobacco.

Every once and a while I'll find myself just thinking now is a good time to light a cig while waiting for the computer to do something or I'm waiting whatever.  Still the cravings the first 3 days were the worst of it all.  So far I'm doing alright, I do miss the social part of smoking but I'll be better off without it.  Boy did I get sick about 4 days after I quit.  Just hacking up flem, I had to take the day off cause I was coughing so much.  it's gotten better and the coughing is less and less.  Mostly just sneezing now with loads of mucus.

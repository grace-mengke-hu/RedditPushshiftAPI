Well I messed up, but I'm still coming back.

Hey everyone, 

So I'll try to be brief but the last few weeks have been really shitty for me. Just over two weeks ago my gf's father was killed in a terrible flood in Laos. Naturally, she is devastated and the whole situation has been really bad with emotions running high and everyone scrambling to figure out how to move forward. 

I was really close with him. We had become really good friends (sometimes even to the envy of my gf). While the loss has obviously been more difficult for her, I too feel really depressed over it. Both her and her father are smokers so it's sometimes tough to be around them but after nine months I thought I wouldn't give in. But here I am again at the start. 

Anyway, after grieving with some scotch I found a pack of his cigarettes and just smoked the whole thing in an afternoon. This was two weeks ago and I'm still coming down off the nicotine sickness. 

I wish I didn't but I hope I can communicate to others that it does not help at all with the grieving process. I hope for me this is the last time I learn this lesson and I can go on to finally get that one year star. 

Stay strong everyone. Wishing all of you nice smoke free days.

Hi everyone! Day 5 and still iffy about this.

Just wanted a place to talk about quitting smoking and my situation.

I did NOT choose to quit; I am currently a nurse, as well as a nursing student trying to finish a degree and one of the hospitals I will be working/learning in does not allow any of their workers to use nicotine. I was unaware of this until I took a drug test and my advisor informed me that I would have to quit smoking cigarettes if I wanted to continue with school. WHAT.

I've been smoking since I was 16. I am now 23 and have quit every other drug that I have been addicted to, with the help of cigarettes. Letting go of this has been rough, but I am 5 days in, the longest I have ever gone without a cigarette in 7 years.

Ahhhhhhh!!!!!

I'm still on this sub, unfortunately

Yesterday I went to the city with some old friends - all who smoked. The windows to the vehicle didn't roll down all the way so I was basically stuck in a hot boxed car. I was offered probably 10 cigarettes throughout the day and I declined every single one except one, and I gave it back immediately..I enjoyed myself yesterday, a little, I spent all the money I would have spent on cigarettes since I quit. I ate great food. However, I realized maybe my friends weren't really my friends. I used to smoke a lot with them. They don't understand why I've quit... "Why quit when you've already started?" One said.. I wanted to punch her in the face. I wish I had friends that didn't have to smoke after every small event, such as eating. Or sneak liquor into a seafood restaurant. I know a total of 4 people who don't smoke. We barely speak to each other but it's fucking 4.

It feels like these cravings are just periods of anxiety and depression and nicotine is the only way to fix it in the long run. I don't know if I can continue with my quit.

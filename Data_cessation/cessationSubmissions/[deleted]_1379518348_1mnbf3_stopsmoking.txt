Trouble breathing after quitting smoking - couldn't yawn

Three times, after long (3-9 month) quits, I've experienced trouble taking "fulfilling" breaths.  This would lead to yawns which I couldn't finish.  This symptom lasts for months until I finally break down and smoke, after which it goes away.

This seemed crazy to me - I BREATH BETTER WHEN I SMOKE.  I always assumed it was anxiety showing up after I quit.  It made quitting impossible - not being able to breath right for months, knowing everything would be better if I had a smoke.

This time around, I looked into it more.  It seems as though smoking trains your body to pull in more oxygen through increased red blood cells.  When you quit, the added oxygen can cause hyperventilation.

After not being able to catch my breath right for the last few weeks, I started taking shorter breaths this morning.  Sweet relief!  Almost instantly, my chest felt right.

Guess it's time to learn how to breathe again.  Just a note for anybody else out there experiencing the same thing.

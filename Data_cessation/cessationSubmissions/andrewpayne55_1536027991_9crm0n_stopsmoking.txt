I messed up

Last Friday (day 59) I got drunk and I ended up caving. I knew what I was doing and I knew that I was throwing away everything that I had worked so hard to achieve.
I woke up on Saturday feeling like crap and I am still so furious and disappointed in myself. 
I have managed not to smoke since and I am going to try and be more careful in the future, but does anyone have any advice for what to do if I find myself in a similar scenario again?

I just paid $76.86—roughly 12 packs of cigarettes—to motivate myself to quit smoking.

And for good reason, too... I just signed myself and my husband up for our very first 5k in March!

He and I have been smokers since about age 17 (now 24) and I'm starting to feel too old for this crap. He always told me he'd be more motivated to quit if there was some sort of end-goal with a hard deadline pushing him to do so. Well... now we have it :)

Wish me (us) luck! I'm trying to make today my day 1. I know reading through everyone else's success stories will help me through the roughest parts, so thanks, everyone, for being so awesome!

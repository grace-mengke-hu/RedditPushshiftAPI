My girlfriend quit smoking and just passed the one week mark. Is there any way I can be more supportive?

My girlfriend smoked for about 16 years. When we met I was a smoker as well but have since quit. 
The last week has been really hard for her and I do my best to try and keep her positive. She is starting to feel like she has no interests, bored, lethargic and has no sex drive . I want to find more for us to do together but she just can't seem to get out of this funk. I want her to be happy, I just don't know what to do. Any one have suggestions? Tips? Similar stories? Anything?

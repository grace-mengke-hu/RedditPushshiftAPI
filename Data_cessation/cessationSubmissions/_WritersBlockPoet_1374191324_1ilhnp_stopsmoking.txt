Made several attempts to quit smoking but still having a hard time. Advise? Tips? How you quit?

I actually enjoy smoking, but I hate everything that comes with it. 
Financially right now smoking isn't even an option.  I've tried quitting several times in the last few years. Longest I have made without a smoke was 3 months, with the help of the patches.
Everyone I know smokes, so socially it becomes unbearable. I always say "this will be my last pack" and find myself walking over the the corner store to grab my pack.  It needs to stop. Any advise? How is quitting working for you? How can I get over the cravings when Im out?

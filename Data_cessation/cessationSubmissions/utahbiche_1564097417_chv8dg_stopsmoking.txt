Heading to 50 days away from tobacco &amp; tips

Just wanted to share my journey as a non smoker that has been such chaotic :) 

I went to live in China couple years ago and though that smoking cumulated to pollution wasnâ€™t the best idea for my health. Even cigarettes are very cheap there, I managed to quit cold turkey without much effort. Once I moved back to France, two year after being a non smoker, I bought one cig paquet and became a smoker again as simple as it is. 

After one year and half of smoking, I was tired of coughing in the morning and being the slave of nicotine. I removed cigarettes from my life 50 days ago without daily use of substitutes.

Here are some tips that are working for me: 

- Have support : on Reddit , friend, family or gf/bf. you likely have more success rate if you are supported.

- Take Benefit of a change in your life : you got a new situation, new routine ? Include stop smoking. 

- Emergency cases: I always carry a nicotine patch in my wallet in case of I would not be able to deal with a craving. For example I was sipping a glass of wine with smoker friends and... the temptation showed up. Patches helped me a lot to avoid to smoke in this kind of situation. 

- Save money : I invested in bitcoin instead of spending money in cigarettes.

- Stay motivated : always remind you the benefits of being a non smoker. Read studies, reports, figures for instance. (Last one I read : https://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf)

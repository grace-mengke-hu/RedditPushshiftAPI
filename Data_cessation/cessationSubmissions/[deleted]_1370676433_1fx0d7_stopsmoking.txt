Quitting tomorrow

I've made it once for a whole day. I've gotten back in to cardio and want to lose the only thing keeping me from running 3-4 miles. I know it feels good to beat the head game and tell myself "All I have to do is say no." I'm taking another shot at it tomorrow. Advice? Lowfat/healthy snacks to curb the jones? What can I probably expect on day 2? 3? Help would be appreciated from successful quitters (get it?) Smoked for 11 years btw

1 month in

I haven't puffed one in a month. I'm pretty proud of myself.
I used the vaporizer for two weeks with 12mg, 1 week of 9mg (mixed 12 and 6), and 1 week of 6 mg. Today is the last day. I'm out of cash, and I'm not planning on staying hooked on the vape.

The withdrawals are coming... 

I'm about to freak the fuck out. I've been deep breathing for an hour now.

Thanks for the "subject?". It's a nice way to vent. 

Stay strong on your journey everyone!

When does the fogginess go away?

Hello.

I have tried to quit multiple of times, and failed due to extreme withdrawal symptoms.

I started smoking when I was in middle school and in college now (so.. around 7years?).

Every time I tried to quit, there was this "fogginess" in my brain that just won't go away. I can't do anything. I can't think clearly, or focus on my work.

Because I am a student, this withdrawal symptom affects me the most.

I really want to quit, because I can tell the addiction and the craving becomes stronger each day. (I can't last more than 2 hours now...)

When did you guys find the fogginess in the brain go away? If you guys ever felt such thing..

Thank you in advance

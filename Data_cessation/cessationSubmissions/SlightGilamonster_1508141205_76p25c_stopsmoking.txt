Secret smoker for 15 years, stopped 1 day

I've been a secret smoker for 15 years, but yesterday I've decided enough is enough.
I was organizing everything in my life just to have the opportunity to smoke without anyone noticing.
Since nobody knows that I've smoked; nobody knows I've stopped... so I come to you, Internet-strangers, to get some support :)

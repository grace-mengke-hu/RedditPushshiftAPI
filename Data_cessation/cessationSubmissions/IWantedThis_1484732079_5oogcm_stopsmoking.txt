Weird dream after 24hours!

I had a weird dream last night after 24 hours of not smoking. I quit cold turkey on my birthday after 7years pack a day.

Dream/Nightmare: I was back to high school (where I never smoked though) and I was running here and there finding a place to smoke. I couldn't find a place where I could smoke legally and was immensely restless. As far as I can recall I didn't end up smoking in the dream. 

I woke up with a very good feeling though, was able to take deep breaths. At office I could actually figure out the colleagues who smoked and that was a big turn off! Feeling so good.

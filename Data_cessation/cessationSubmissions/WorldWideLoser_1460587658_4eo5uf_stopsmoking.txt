First day of my thousandth time quitting, but I am going to make this time the last.

Just wanted to post as a show of respect for this subreddit, I don't post much but reading the posts here have motivated me to go at it, this time all chips are in. I have decided to move out from a place of bad influence where I would booze and smoke cigs everyday and just generally feel bad. Throughout the days while going on with life cigarettes helped with the stress of feeling as though I was not making progress or doing what I want, they calmed me, then night came and I would drink and smoke almost a full pack. I am now trying to change my life for the better. Quitting cigarettes will be a reminder everyday of what my goal is. Everytime I see someone smoke or I crave one I will think of the self deprecating state I have been in and use that as motivation to keep looking forward and trying my best to do all I can in this life and find out as much as I can about myself. Heres to day one and to whatever day you may be on, stay strong and don't look back. Cheers.

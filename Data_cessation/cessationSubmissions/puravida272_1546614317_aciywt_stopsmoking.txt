Day Four

Hope you are all doing well. New year and we’re all breathing air!! I heard somewhere the brain understands positive statements more than negative ones so my mantra and rule is breathing air (instead of Not smoking). I even caught myself in a craving and my brain said nope rule #2 breathe fresh air. Not sure if any of this is making any sense lol. 

Day 4 and I have some things to accomplish today. A list unfolded as I was journaling last night and now it’s time to put this extra time and boost of energy into some productive tasks. I aim to take it slow, at a sloths pace even. If you’re trying to accomplish things today remember to be easy on yourself :) we are healing and perhaps that’s the greatest priority for a little while.

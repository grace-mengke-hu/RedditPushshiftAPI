Anybody have some advice?

Hi!

I'm quitting today. Had a smoke this morning and decided it'll be my last.

I didn't want to quit because I felt completely fine as a smoker, but this past week I've had the worst sleep of my life. My guess is that it is due to quitting smoking while simultaneously quitting my addiction to internet pornography, because if I don't quit both then I will never quit either. I have to clear the addiction pathways in my brain so that I can be completely clean again.

Last night, I woke up at midnight and didn't fall asleep until 2AM. It was terrible! I craved something, but I didn't know what. I ate some snacks, drank water, tried meditating, and still felt restless. Eventually, I gave in to porn because I knew it'd help me sleep. Big mistake!

The insomnia caused by nicotine withdrawal is killing me. I lay up all night long and can't keep my eyes closed. I tried melatonin, but didn't work. I'll try a slightly higher dose tonight.

Anybody else here experience terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal? If you have any suggestions I'll be very appreciative and take them to heart. I want to get past this initial hump, and part of it involves knowing how long the dreaded restlessness will last.

Thanks, everyone. Good luck to you all.

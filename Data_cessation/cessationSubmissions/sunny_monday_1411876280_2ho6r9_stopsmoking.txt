Im never quitting again!

Ugh. It has been 12 days. It has been ridiculously hard. So hard, I dont ever want to quit again. 

I am using a vape to help me through. Despite that, I have had every symptom on the planet so far: eating like crazy, constipation, couldnt think/concentrate at work (totally made some big mistakes as a result and also snapped very angrily at my boss), Ive got weird acne, my mouth is really dry, I can hardly sleep.

Ive quit before but dont recall the withdrawal symptoms being this horribly bad. Im determined to never quit again.

I've Failed, & am Having Trouble Getting Back to Being a Non-Smoker

Late last month, god made it clear to me while I was meditating (& while praying) that he wanted me to quit smoking. So I did- with great difficulty. I threw my last 4 cigarettes away & started eating hard candy when I had cravings. Yesterday I was on day 4, & nicotine patches came in the mail. I put on 2 of them & felt a bit better. Today I bought a pack, & am on my way to having smoked 1/2 of them soon. I'm afraid of what the consequences will be that I disobeyed god- & even with that fear, I'm struggling to stay stopped when I get to be between cigarettes. The fear makes me want a smoke, but it's having that smoke that would bring about the consequences I'm afraid of. The insanity of it is that I still go & have 'one more'. I hope god will forgive me for failing. I'll be going to bed early so I won't be smoking, then will try again in the morning. I'm torn regarding staying stopped tonight. This fear of the unknown consequence makes it harder to stop- I feel the need to self-soothe w/ a smoke. That's what's making it hard right now. In the meantime, I pray that god grants me the strength to stop, & won't strike me down with terrible consequences. I know I'm in the wrong- especially when it comes to god's will. But it's SO hard to stop.

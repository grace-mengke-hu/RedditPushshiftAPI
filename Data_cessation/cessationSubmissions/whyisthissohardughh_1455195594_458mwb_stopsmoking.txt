The cravings, the hunger, the anger

I am a 23f and this is what feels like my millionth attempt to quit. I am only 2 days in this round and I am cranky, hungry, craving, and coughing. Every part of me wants to just go buy a pack and deal with it but then I think of how my body is now that I've inhaled these chemicals for the last 9ish years. I want to stay smoke free but whenever something happens, good or bad, my go to is a Newport menthal. I go to the gym already and that just seems to kick up the hunger that always seems to be there now. My husband just quit as well, he is 3 days in and we are at eachothers throats because we are so on edge and irritable.  Does it really get better? Because this is taking every bit of my will power to keep going.

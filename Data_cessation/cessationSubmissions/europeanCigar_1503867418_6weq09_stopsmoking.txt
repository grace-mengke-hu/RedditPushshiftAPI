First time drinking

So i was procastinating to get some Beers. Because everytime when i have some drinks i crave cigarettes hard. Had my first football game of the season today and as is tradition after the match we had some drinks.  Because the weather was topnotch we had the drinks outside. I decided to stay and force myself to resist the temptation. Im really glad i did it and that i did not smoke a cigarette. Almost at day 17 and im feeling great!

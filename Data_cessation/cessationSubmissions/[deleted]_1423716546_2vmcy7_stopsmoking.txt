Day 7. The withdrawals have come back.

After many botched attempts at quitting, I'm finally determined to never smoke again. 

Things have been going well. As expected, the first three days were tough. I felt like I was on top of the world on day 5. Now, I'm back in bed watching Netflix and I can't move. I don't feel depressed. I just feel like withdrawals are kicking my ass again. I'm dizzy, light headed, my nerves are shot, and I feel like I can't function.

Has anyone else gone thought this? Is it normal to really start feeling better, and then suddenly and unexpectedly feel like shit again?

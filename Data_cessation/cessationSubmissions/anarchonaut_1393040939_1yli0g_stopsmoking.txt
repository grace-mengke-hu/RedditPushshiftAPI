50 days! Feeling proud albeit nervous. Thanks for all the support.

Haven't gone this long without a smoke in ~6 years, and I am feeling fantastic. I'm doing my best to maintain abstinence- I've finally realized that I cannot even have just one. It's getting more difficult now, as I am studying abroad in Chile and it seems that more people smoke here. Also, there aren't as many restrictions as there are in the States. Still, I know this is no excuse to start up again. The cravings are far less frequent nowâ€¦for all of you just quitting or thinking about it- it gets easier! Thanks to this community for all the support and inspiration. Stay strong everyone.

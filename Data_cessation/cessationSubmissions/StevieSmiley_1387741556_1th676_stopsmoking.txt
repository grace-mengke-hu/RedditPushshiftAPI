The Reveal

About once a month I go to the smoke shop - not for myself but for others. Besides, it's not for me to tell them to quit or what to do with their lives. It probably wouldn't do anything anyway but piss them off. ( Like I would have been, as a smoker ) It doesn't actually bother me, and since it was a trigger was probably a good idea to take care of it early.

Last month when I went in, it smelled pleasant. Just something about tobacco places always had that alluring quality to it, like... aahhh such a refreshing place to be! 


 This month was way different. It's like someone lifted a rug to reveal 
the mold under it. I could still smell that weird allure but under that smell it was this totally gross - almost gagging aroma - practically like an ashtray kinda smell. I mention to the owner(?) that I quit 2 months ago and that the place started smelling kinda gross, and surprisingly he seemed to agree!

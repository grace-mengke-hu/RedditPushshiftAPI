Secondhand smoke?

Hey guys, first time poster here with a question? Today marks 14 days for me! yay! The past two weeks have been a challenge, but has been slowly getting better and better EXCEPT for today. My husband is still smoking and I have been around him everyday since my quit except today. Crazy cravings and I've been so irritable. Im wondering if there is still nicotine in my body since I have been around him while he is smoking and I'm just now finally starting to really withdraw since I am no longer around the secondhand smoke?

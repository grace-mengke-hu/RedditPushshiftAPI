90 Days = Feeling Great!

Hey if any of you guys are quitting today, let me tell you about my favorite nonsmoking thing right now.

Smells.

Holy balls everything smells amazing.  

I love rolling down both windows on the highway just to smell everything rushing in.

I love the sous chefing for my SO in the kitchen way more now. 

Instead of trying to cut the peppers quick so I can go smoke my pre-before-dinner-cigarette before i have my before-dinner-cigarette, I take my time, learning how to cut, smelling and tasting organic veggies (I can afford them now that i've stopped smoking ($5.10 x 90 days=$459.00 so far!) enjoying having the monkey off my back instead of feeling the pressure in my chest, smelling like ashtray.

Unwrapping GTA5 with the shrinkwrap smell....ahhhhhhhhhhhh........

Rain on fallen leaves. 

Even my sweat in yoga class right now smells more sweet than it did during my 3 years of yoga practice as a smoker.   

Just sharing.  This has been the simple enjoyment I revel in.

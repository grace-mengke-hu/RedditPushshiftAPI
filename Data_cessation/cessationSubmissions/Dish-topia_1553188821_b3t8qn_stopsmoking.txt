Vaper Taper

So I know the general attitude of this sub is that cold turkey is the best way to quit and tapering is not. I've read Allen Carr and quit using his method for more than a year, but I started smoking again a couple years ago. I re-read Easyway a few times and couldn't maintain my quits. Maybe it's because I work with so many smokers. I don't really know.  What I do know, is that I have switched to a vape (one of the little usb stick style ones) and it's scratching that itch. It's been 16 days since my last cigarette and I don't miss them in the slightest. Vaping is a much more pleasant way to get nicotine and I love that I don't stink like I used to.

However, my end goal is to become totally nicotine free. For the last 2 weeks I've been a friggin choo-choo train. Vaping all the time. It's tough, because there isn't really an end point. When you smoke a cigarette, you get to end, stub it out and then have another one later. With the vape, I don't even have to go outside, I just pull it out and go at it. Having it in my pocket all day is kind of dangerous. I can vape in my apartment, at work, almost where ever so I end up vaping almost constantly.

So today, I'm working on getting the vaping in check. Instead of having my vape in my pocket all the time, I keep it in a drawer. When I pull it out, I start a timer on my watch. I puff on it for 5 minutes and then put it away again. When the timer gets to at least an hour, I can take it out again and restart my timer, repeating the cycle.  My plan is to keep increasing the time in between sessions until I've quit.

Another idea I've been toying with is refilling my cartridges with a mix of nicotine and no-nicotine juice and slowly changing the ratio till it's zero nicotine. I just worry that as the nicotine decreases, my vaping will increase.

Either way, I'll be updating this post with my progress.

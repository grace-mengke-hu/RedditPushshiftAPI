I made it through my first fight with my SO without grabbing a smoke!

All my quits in the past I've blown because I can't handle having my SO mad at me for being on edge from quitting. When we had our inevitable fight last night, I was able to breath my way through it and before I knew it the fight was resolved and I Didn't smoke! 

I think I may do it this time! Fingers crossed.

Went to an open mic yesterday. Sets of just two songs each, rotating between a bunch of young local talent. While some friends were outside smoking, they missed the best set of a guy who played piano tributes to Mario and Luigi to Piano Man and Mad World. Presenting #082 Magneton. See you tomorrow.

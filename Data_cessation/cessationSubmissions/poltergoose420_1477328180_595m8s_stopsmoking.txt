I'm thinking about quitting because I can't figure out why I'm even smoking

So it's like I go to community college and there's nothing to do between classes so I keep going out to the smoking spot which I like because there's people there I talk to and smoking is what goes on there so I just started buying packs. But I feel guilty about it because it's costly, my parents don't know and I don't like keeping anything from them, and it's bad for me and the actual act of smoking doesn't make me feel good. Also I've been going to school like two hours specifically to stand around talk to people and smoke . I need help quitting but I don't know where to go instead of the smoke shack and I really don't want to have this conversion with my parents. Advice?

Heart beating fast before I sleep?

Hello guys,
I was wondering if anyone has any insight to whether quitting cigarettes creates a higher heart rate for some people due to possible anxiety/panic attacks from withdrawal? I get it when I'm in bed, for maybe 10-15 minutes max. 
Have any of you experienced this?

Just stopped three days ago, Chantix route. Struggling.

I stopped smoking on Christmas and started on Chantix. I used it before last year and I had quit for three months, for the duration of the medication without any problems. I moved from Austin, Texas to Minneapolis around the same time I ran out and ended up going back to smoking.

This time around, I'm really struggling. I want to smoke so bad. Muscles are all tense. What's hardest is that I'm a recovering alcoholic, almost four years sober, and an extrovert. I don't know what to do at parties without cigarettes. And it sucks to just have to give up one more thing.

But I really want to quit. I hate the taste, the smell, the expense. It does nothing for me, it makes me and my girlfriend worry about cancer and me not living long. I don't want it in my life but MAN I want one right now.

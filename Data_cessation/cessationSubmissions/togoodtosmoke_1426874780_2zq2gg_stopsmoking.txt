Quitting

Hello fellow non-smokers. I'm a long time lurker and i decided to create an account so i could post here. I'm actually surprised that this username was available. OK so, I am 22 years old and I haven't smoked the last 23 hours. I really want to stop, I just do not want to smoke anymore, I dislike the smell, I feel like a prisoner every time I have to get out of a bar/office/room to have a smoke... I know it is not worth it at all. I have no problem staying smoke free while I am at home or office. But I find it extremely difficult when I am outside with friends, having a coffee or beer (especially when I am drinking alcohol). I need your help reddit, please share your experience with me on how you managed to stay smoke-free.

P.s How do i get that badge?

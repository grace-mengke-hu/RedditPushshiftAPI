Friend started smoking

I have a friend and we were talking about how if you do quit smoking before you turn 30 98% of the harmful effects will go away, and you can live a normal life.  He took this as to mean he can start smoking until he is 30.  Is there any evidence of permanent irreversible damage and other life long effects of smoking?  Is there any evidence I can show him its not ok?

Third Week

Did anyone else find the third week hard? It'll be three weeks tomorrow for me, but I've felt like arse all this week, no cravings, I've just felt ill, dizzy, nauseous, anxious, just shite.

First week I felt rubbish, the brain fog was ridiculous, second week I felt really good, I find it odd that the third would be worse than the second.

It doesn't really matter because I don't even think about cigarettes any more, even when I wake up, and used to go straight for a fag, I don't think about them any more, nor get cravings, I just feel unwell.

I'll hit 90 days the day before my wedding!

I still get cravings quite often. When I do I always read through the posts here and look at my tag. 88 days today! On Sunday I will wear my wedding dress and smell like me! I won't accidentally burn my gown from smoking a cigarette in the wind or some such nonsense. I won't be anxious to go outside in between the ceremony and cake cutting. I won't suck three down due to nerves and smell like an ashtray right before I stroll down the aisle on my Father's arm. My husband will (hopefully) remember that I bought the same perfume I used when we began dating just for this special day. I feel more accomplished the higher this number gets. While it has become easier as time goes on, I still think about it every day. I will not smoke again.

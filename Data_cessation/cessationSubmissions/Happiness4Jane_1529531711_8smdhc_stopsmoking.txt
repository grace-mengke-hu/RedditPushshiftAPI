3-weeks free today! Instead of smoking 10 cigarettes with coffee in the morning, I run 4 miles. I love it! I feel strong and energized. Distract yourself with something that makes you feel awesome! It helps. Take it from a lady that smoked a pack a day for 25 years. I barely even think about it now.

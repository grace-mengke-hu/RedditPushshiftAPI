Two weeks tomorrow, and a victory.

I was taking turns off and on a for couple days at a time since my first attempt.  Been away from this sub a little while now, sorting myself out in other areas.  Just updated my badge to show I quit for good on the 5th.  

Last night I went out drinking with friends (Hopslam release, for you beer nerds.  It was beautiful.).  Stayed 'til close and I didn't even think about it when the smokers stepped outside.  I know I'll have harder days, but last night was so easy and encouraging.  I feel great.  

I sleep at least an hour less most nights, I wake up rested, and I dream again (I kinda missed that).  I'm motivated and pursuing desires and needs I used to just choke and stifle with a cigarette.  Once I had the nicotine out of my system, my anxiety and depression both improved dramatically.  I hope you already know these things are coming, but if you're doubting, let me assure you they will.  It's worth a few weeks discomfort.  

Reading your success stories helped me, so I hope mine will give someone else a little pull up and out of the stuff.

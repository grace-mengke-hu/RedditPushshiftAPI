I’ve had enough

A habit I wish I would have never picked up and I’m fed up with it. Just broke the remaining cigarettes I had left in my pack. Been having weird feelings in my neck which has only increased my horrible anxiety that I struggle with daily. I’ve lurked here for the longest and just wanted to vent a little. Hopefully I can beat this once and for all.

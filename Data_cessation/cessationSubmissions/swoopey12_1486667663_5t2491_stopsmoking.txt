E cigarette tapering is going pretty good!

I slowly switched over to only using an e cigarette over a 3 month period and it worked! Now I have used this vape over the past 2 years and I just want to quit because I've read studies that state nicotine can actually worsen depression and anxiety even though people say it helps with those two things for me it doesn't. So the past two weeks I would measure a set amount of e liquid I can use per day to prevent me going through a lower nicotine bottle faster than a higher mg bottle during his taper. I started at one 12mg nicotine 30ml bottle for the first week, second week I dropped it down to 8mg and now I'm on a 6mg bottle next is going to be 4mg , 3mg and so on. The only problem I encountered was having less of a throat hit at 6mg but I countered that by getting a very menthol flavor that cools the throat. Virtually feel no withdrawals yet but it may be a different story when I get to 4mg per week. Definitely beats cold turkey or the nicotine gum which I tried to taper with   plenty of times but couldn't because it may be the hand to mouth motion that's ritualistic at this point. Cold turkey is unimaginable but I think there's really a chance to succeed here!

[PollS] What methodS and techniqueS worked for you?

Long time lurker and first time poster here. Thanks so much for all that you have shared so far.

I was wondering if I could ask you to complete a couple of quick polls. I know there have been a few polls in the past, but most have been single-answer ones. I'd like to see what method**(s)** and technique**(s)** worked for those of you who have quit.

**[Methods poll here](http://www.strawpoll.me/14455804)** || **[Techniques poll here](http://www.strawpoll.me/14455822)**

Many thanks in advance! Feel free to leave comments if you think I left something out or if you want to share your combinations :)

PS: My quit date is December 1st.

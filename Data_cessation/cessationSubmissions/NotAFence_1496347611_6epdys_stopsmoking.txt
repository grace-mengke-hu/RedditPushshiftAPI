Nobody warns you about this downside of quitting smoking!

It's been over 100 days since I've quit and I have to bring up what sucks the most..my heightened sense of smell! So while this means I can appreciate a walk in the park much greater of my morning cup of coffee as well, I can also detect when you haven't used a deodorant or what you had for lunch! Haha 100 days in and never felt better..if you're thinking about quitting, take the plunge! Why be addicted to something that just reduces your quality of life and is slowly killing you? Do remember everybody who picks up cigarettes believes they're invincible to cancer and other deadly diseases..until they get it! Good luck and happy quitting :-)

Almost 10 days

I been saying I am a non-smoker for the last ten years for a variety of reasons (excuses).  Kept saying I can quit whenever I wanted and for the most part I really didn't smoke on weekends.  I do live with my parents and hid the fact, got defensive if they got into my car and honestly after suffering from a terrible cold, I decided my grandma's birthday would be the day I quit.

I smoked initially a few cigs a day, bummed them at bars, then people started asking to bum from me...yadda yadda yadda... I became a non-social / social-smoker.  

Right now I puff a few times on an eCig but only when the cravings are more unbearable.  And honestly I am doing that now less and less and I think by day 21 I should be completely nicotine free.

I feel great, never better.  Amazing how being a decade long "non-smoker" how much of a smoker I really was, even though it was only half-pack a day but seeing the stats in Smoke Free really is making this better and the encouragement from real life friends and now the reddit community is going to make me really quit for good this time.

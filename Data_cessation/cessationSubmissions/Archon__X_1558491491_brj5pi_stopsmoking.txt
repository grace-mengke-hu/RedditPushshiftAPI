Coming up on a week

Hey all, been smoking for 15 years and finally it looks like I'll be able to quit. Been smoke-free for almost a whole week and I've replaced the time I'd spend smoking with going to the gym every day... I like swimming and I'm going to start lifting and the endorphins of a good workout really help take the place of what nicotine would give. I'm feeling better already physically and sleeping better :) Anyway, everyone stay strong! Absolutely nobody is glad they started smoking and every person who was able to quit is glad they could. Hard to argue with a consensus like that!

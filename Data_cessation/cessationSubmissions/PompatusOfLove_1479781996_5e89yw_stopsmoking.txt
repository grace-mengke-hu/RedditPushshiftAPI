I quit smoking 17 years ago. I still relate to quitters and that's why I lurk this sub

I quit on July 29, 1999, at the stroke of midnight.  I was in a bowling alley.

I was 26 years old.  I had smoked since I was 16.  I am 43 years old now, and quitting is still something I count among my life's most critical successes.

I lurk to remind myself how far I've come.  I comment now and again to encourage you guys.

Never underestimate how serious your battle to quit is to your future!  Don't look back!

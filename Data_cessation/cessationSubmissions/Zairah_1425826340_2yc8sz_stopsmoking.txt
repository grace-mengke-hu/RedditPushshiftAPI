Help me finish it!

So 9 days ago I stopped smoking (almost). I was a pack or more a day smoker for 20 years. 

I started with the Step 1 patch. For 3 days I had zero cigarettes. I had my wisdom teeth out so honestly those first 3 days were easy as I was drugged up and sore. The next few days I cheated a bit just a drag a couple times a day. I decided to step down to the step 2 patch 4 days ago, and I didn't even notice a difference. I was still cheating twice a day though and still am. I have a couple drags of a smoke in the morning and in the evening. Likely doesn't even equal a whole smoke total. 

I LOVE not smoking. I read Allen Carrs book, and totally agree with most of it (other than the patch thing, it's really helped me). I feel free! We went on a long road trip yesterday, didn't have to stop for my addiction. I love waking up in the morning and not jumping right out of bed to go outside. I love watching a movie without having to take a break. I love not being stinky. I love that I might not die as young now. I just love all of it. 

I know forsure I am going to conquer this addiction but I seem to be prolonging taking that final step and I don't know why!

Talk me out of those couple drags a day, guys!

Will someone be my quit buddy?

I've tried the smartphone apps, I've tried the gum - I just always seem to relapse whenever stress hits. 

I think having someone "out there" who I've made a promise to would be really helpful. Ideally someone who's also just quitting, and who could reach out to me in a time of need/craving, or vice versa.

Would this be helpful to anyone else? Anyone wanna be my quit-time partner-in-crime? Get at me!

How the fuck have you guys done it?

Read Easyway, quit for a few months and got back into it. It seems that book only works for your first attempt. I've made many half-hearted attempts to quit over the past few months, quitting for a few days at most and then being hit with a ridiculous urge and then just buying a pack. I'm currently working out pretty routinely so I use that as motivation to quit, but it doesn't seem enough. How'd you guys do this?

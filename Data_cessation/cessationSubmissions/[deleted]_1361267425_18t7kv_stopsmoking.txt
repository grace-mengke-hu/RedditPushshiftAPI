Quitting today - Also new to sub so hi!

Hi all, newly active redditor and now 'ex-smoker' of about 3 hours. I want to quit because I hack up so much shit I can't breathe when I get into my flat. I'm only on the second floor!

It's been fucking me up nigh on ten years so I've been quitting every time I feel like I can give it a shot/don't have any coffin nails left in the morning. 

So here is my line in the sand, today I just didn't buy a pack on the way to work and I feel a bit giddy, like I can do anything.

I await the crash nervously and was looking for advice on combating the quitters blues - this is what gets me much more than the physical stuff.

EDIT: Cracked after a big pub lunch but I'm still committed to quitting!

Peace out and good luck to all in your endeavors to quit!

Okay guys...

I'm currently 16 days in being smoke free! These are my thoughts.

Wasn't super hard to quit smoking since I've been wanting to for such a long time. 

Benefits I have noticed so far:

- Far Less Anxious!
- WAY MORE energy
- Better Breathing
- Overall Happier 
- And for the guys, a topic that really isn't talked about but my sex drive has sky rocketed! I have better erections and over better organisms. I've been noticing for the past year or more that during sex my erections wouldn't last lost I would go soft in the middle of it but I was totally into it. Now holy crap! Im never going back to smoking! I honestly thought I was having signs of erectile dysfunction turns out smoking fucks up your sex drive too. 

Downfalls I've noticed:
- Was super tired for the first week and a half 
- headache for the first week 


If you want to quit do it now this will be the best thing for you. You can do it, i was a smoker for 10 years it's kind over matter. I wish you guys the best!

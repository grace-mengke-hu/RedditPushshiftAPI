I'm not a smoker.

I just *stopped* smoking, I just *didn't buy* another pack. This time was different. 

It wasn't a conscious effort, no one was harassing me, this time it "wasn't a big deal". I just stopped. It's kind of dumb-founding. 

Every other time I've tried to quit, it's been a hell-raising stress-fest with a terrible stigma around it. It's not this time. I didn't tell anyone except my husband, I didn't need to.

I am using a non-nicotine vape to make the hand to mouth habit a bit easier. But, I'm about three days in and I'm not using it as much as I used to smoke regularly. It helps me curb the morning smoke and in the car smoke, these are my strongest cravings. I just finished lunch and I'm here writing this instead of making a trip outside. It's the little things that feel victorious.

So far the worst thing I've experienced is that I'm VERY sluggish and my brain seems hazy. I also have a pretty bad headache and my gums are sore :/

I'm taking 1000 mg of vitamin C 3 times a day and a multiV, biotin, folic acid and b12 in the morning. Idk of these things are helping. Just throwing it out there.

Cold water has been the best so far at curbing mild cravings. I've been drinking tons.

I wish everyone in this sub the best of luck. I have really enjoyed reading everyone else's experiences, so I wanted to share mine since I felt like you all might understand.

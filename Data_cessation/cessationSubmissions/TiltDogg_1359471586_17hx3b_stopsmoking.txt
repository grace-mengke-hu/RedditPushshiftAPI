Let's hear your stats - I know you know 'em!

Well, thanks to a killer Subreddit, Alan Carr, and some mental re-tuning (a constant necessity in my life)...  I am just over three weeks free from the bonds of a freakin' plant.  I thank you all for your stories and entertainment, because I am certain that I have won...  There would be no premature celebration.  I'm sure you all have done the math or have a trusty app, as I do, that tells you all of your amazingly, jaw-dropping, personal statistics.  So let's hear 'em.

By the numbers...  this is my 23rd day without a cigarette.  I had smoked at least a pack per day since 15 and I am 34 now.  I would have smoked 515 cigarettes by now, assuming I continued to smoke at the rate of when I stopped.  I have saved $123.60 USD.  

I'm not even touching on the health and social benefits.  The self confidence, etc...  Why was I so stupid?

Edit: to note that it SAYS I have saved 2 days 3hrs 30mins...  but I'm not real sure what the equation is to figure that out...  I am skeptical.

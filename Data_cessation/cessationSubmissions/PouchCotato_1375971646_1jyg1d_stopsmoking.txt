Didn't think that my body was damaged yet...

I started smoking 7 yrs ago and I am 29 now. A month ago, I thought smoking has not done any harm to me yet...A full body check-up showed good results, blood reports were normal, I exercised regularly for the last 1 year, I ran regularly since the weather got warmer this year...all while smoking 10 cigs per day. 

One month after I quit, I now realize that my breathing, walking, running, exercising, climbing a staircase, bathroom singing has become much much easier! Over the years, I was conditioned into thinking that a certain amount of effort was required to do these tasks. Smoking had made me think that I was normal and this is how normal people feel after doing such stuff. 

I thought, its normal to abruptly stop deep breathing because it hurt my chest; its normal to pant after climbing 2 flights of stairs; its normal to clear your throat throughout the day; its normal to wake up and feel a little dizzy/disoriented. 

Just after a month, I now truthfully remember and feel how I was 7 years ago! Of course energy level has varied according to age but breathing, taste, smell has zero problems now!

If you still smoke, your brain may be convincing you that you are fine and normal but quit for a week and you will realize that you were not!

73 hours smoke free

I went cold turkey, started reading Carr book . Not finished yet .  what I feel is like smoking is a prison . I never in 10 year of smoking noticed exactly how much I’m addicted and how I would always make sure to get my hit. I despise the feeling of bing dependent on anything or anyone yet Ive willingly inslaved myself to cigarettes . Bottom line , yes I’m still getting cravings but they have already been less then the first day. Every day I’m learning how to dissociate everything I got myself used to sense I’ve been a teenager. But for the first time I’m completely committed, don’t know why other times I broke after two hours and now I’m going strong ! Hope everyone is feeling good today .?

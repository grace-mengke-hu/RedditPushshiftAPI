Thought I'd share some tips

Yes I know I am only one day in and maybe all of this is known already to most of you, but in case it isn't, here are my tips and tricks.

Read Allen Carr's Easyway, if you have the patience for it. If not, watch this video, it distills the idea. Watch it again and again if you want. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4SG-Ez7iKk
It destroys any pro smoking arguments you may (think you) have.

Personally, I cant just dance away without zero cravings. It is a real struggle going cold turkey. Here is what helps me in those moments:

I keep a list of reasons I dont want to smoke. I whip it out when my addiction starts messing with me and tries to convince me I can go ahead and smoke, "just one":

My health
My money
My children
My wife
My independence
My self esteem

There is no such thing as "just one cigarette"
The cigarette does not stop your craving, it creates it
I am bigger than my cravings
The urge to smoke is not mine, it belongs to my addiction. 
Only by not smoking will I ever be free of this returning discomfort
I am not my addiction

This too shall pass
Stop
Breathe
Now go do something else

This is my list. Try making yours. Look at it when stuff gets really bad and the addiction messes with your decision to quit. 

In addition to this, I whip out the photos of my kids and my wife and look at them for a while to remind me that I would rather like to hang around them for as long as I can.

Also...

Exercise! Nicotine hijacks your dopamine receptors. Work out to get some nice healthy dopamine and endorphine relief.

Drink rediculous amounts of water.

Try mindfulness meditation.

Eat something sour or salty.

Brush your teeth.

Have a shower.

Dont surrender your thoughts to the nicotine. Push your mind onto something else. 

Hope it helps. Good luck everyone.

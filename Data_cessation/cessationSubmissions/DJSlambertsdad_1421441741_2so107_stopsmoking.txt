Today is day 16 cold turkey after at least 30 cigs a day. I thought by day 15 the hurt would stop but the cravings are still strong... Very strong.

I am trying to not focus on the cravings but not very well right now. I'm getting to the mindset that I'm just putting off the inevitable, I'm going to fail so why wait. 

WOW this is such a bullshit mind game while the body hurts. I'll just hang on one more day.

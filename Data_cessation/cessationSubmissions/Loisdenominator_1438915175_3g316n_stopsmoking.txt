Can someone link me to the Easy Way video

I'm sorry to do this. I have seen people rave about the video but have not actually seen it myself because I read the book and never really felt curious enough to click through.

I want to send it to a friend who has started the quitting process but keeps going back and forth. I'd recommendthe book, but he's kind of a brainy guy and I have the feeling he'll be turned off by the writing style.

Thanks in advance. Perhaps it'll be useful to others who will be reading and have yet to see it.

P.S. 777 soon :D

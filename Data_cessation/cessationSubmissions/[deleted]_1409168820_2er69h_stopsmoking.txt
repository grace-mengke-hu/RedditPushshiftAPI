I can't tell if I'm still sick or withdrawing

I think I haven't had a cigarette in two or three days. I got really sick and haven't had a cigarette since so yeah like three days. My palms are sweating balls, I can't focus on anything, I feel stoned as shit and I don't even smoke (no focus, cloudy etc) and my stomach feels weird.

I'm used to irritability (which I don't have), anxiety (which I do have) I'm not necessarily thinking about cigarettes and I'm using a low does ecig so I should be covering my nicotine a little. Are any of the above things normal though? I feel like I'm going a little crazy.

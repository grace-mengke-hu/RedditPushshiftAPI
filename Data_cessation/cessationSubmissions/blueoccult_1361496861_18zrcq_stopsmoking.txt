Week Two, Still Smoke Free

Just wanted to check in and say that I have been a full two weeks without a cigarette.  It's been hard, but I have done it.  The cravings are starting to subside, and I rarely get the urge any more.  Now it's usually just when I am around triggers (ie, my smoker friends, watching a tv show where a character smokes, when I get really stress) that I crave them, but I am able to keep myself in check.  I really want to thank BoremUT for the advice he gave me the post where I declared that I quit.  I honestly don't think I would have been able to get this far without it.  So thank you. :D

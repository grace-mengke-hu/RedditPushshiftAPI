*~* 100 days smokefree! *~*

Hi guys ,
Wow. 
I actually did it, 100 days smokefree today with 3000 cigarettes not smoked!

I'm still using patches / vaping and plan to come off these at the end of the semester. 
Yesterday I was there as a family friend passed from COPD. 

I was smoking 30 a day, so if you think you can't do it - it can be done!
Today is also my birthday!

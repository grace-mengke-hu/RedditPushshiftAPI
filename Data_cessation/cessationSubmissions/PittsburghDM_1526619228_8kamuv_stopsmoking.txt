10 days largely smoke free with a question

Today will have been day 10. I went from slightly over a half a pack per day to 1 per day. The last 2 days nothing. I'm happy with this achievement so far and have to thank several of my co-workers and friends who kept me on the straight and narrow.

 Now a question, Is it normal to get a chest cold while doing cold turkey? I've been out of commission hacking phlegm for the last 2 days. Is that a coincidence or is that from me quitting? 

Thank you

Quitting today, it is about time.

I'm optimistic it will work this time. Like a lot of smokers, I have tried to quit so many times. I once made it 63 days, and I can remember feeling so much better. I crushed up and threw away the rest of my pack on my lunch break. I'm using my 10 year-old daughter as my motivation. I started at 19 to impress a girl I lost my v-card to and she eventually ended up cheating on me. Worst decision I ever made. 

I'm so ready to have my life, energy and time back. I have no motivation for my life and I have a great life, but smoking ruins all of it in a way. Wish me luck.

2 weeks.... First real post addiction craving.

15+ days in and I'm having this very real, "I just want to have one" feeling. I know it's crazy, I know there is never just one... This isn't even a boredom, physically addictive, or emotional craving... it's a 100% mental thing and I'm trying really hard to put it past me. Anyone have any similar experience?

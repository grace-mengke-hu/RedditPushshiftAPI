Checking back in!

I am checking back in and I am in shock that I am at 54 days. I started with the E cigs, and have not used them in about 16 days! Honestly I am a bit surprised by how easy it was this time, but I just stayed strong, used the E smokes as my crutch eventually getting down to 0.0% nicotine and just quit all together. Hope you all stay smoke free too!

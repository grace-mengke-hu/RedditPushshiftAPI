2 Days until quit date.

Whelp, attempt #1023... well not really of course but you get what I'm trying to get at.

I set my quit date on the 20th of December. I seem to be smoking a lot more knowing it's getting closer. I'm watching more motivation videos on YouTube also. Help me get  into the mind state. I'm also setting a regular exercise program going to help me through the cravings. Nothing major, just quick 5-10 minute low impact workout routines. I am hoping that'll turn into full on work out with Cardio and weight training.

A little about my background first. I am turning 40 on February 6th, 2018... which is 48 days after my quit date and I'm excited to get it started. My mind is in the right mood and my heart is set on quitting. I'm currently 245 lbs standing at 5 feet 11 inches. so yea, I am overweight too. Been smoking since i was 14.  that's 26 years of smoking. literally MORE than half my life. I need to quit, before I smoke my life away. I honestly don't think I'll see 60 let alone 55 years of age if i keep this up. Will be keeping a journal that'll write in ow and then when needed. also will be taking "Before" pics of myself. hopefully the comparison will further motivate me by the time I've hit my 40th Birthday...  
anyways... looking forward to keeping those of those whom are interested in my progress updated.

2 more days . . . then no more.

Thoughts on zero nicotine camping?

Haha FML the title is meant to say VAPING. Auto correct is a bitch.

Hi guys, 


Four days strong, down in no small part to this awesome community .



Wanted to see your thoughts on using a zero nicotine vaporizer as a way of replicating the sensation of smoking without the nasty nicotine. 



I've used it intermittently since stopping and I've found it really helps get rid of the cravings as I can seem to trick my body into feeling satisfied by the vape. 



Wether this is a long term solution, I'm not too sure. But until I stop getting cravings it seems to be helping pretty well. 



Anyone else tried it this way? And feedback, ideas etc? Is it going to delay my recovery at all? 




Thanks.

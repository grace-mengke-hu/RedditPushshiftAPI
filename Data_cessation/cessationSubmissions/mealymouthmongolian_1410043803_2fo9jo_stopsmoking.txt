What do non-smokers do on break?

I know this sounds odd, but one of the biggest obstacles for me has been taking breaks at work.  I really just can't wrap my head around what a non-smoker does when they go to break.  I sit in the break room and I am absolutely bored out of my mind.  I can also see the smoking area from the break room so it is absolute torture.

I have tried just not taking a break, but then my day feels like it drags on forever. I don't want to just sit and eat on my break which is what I see everyone else doing.  I'm sure it's just me.  I was perfectly content to fiddle with my phone and talk to the smokers, I guess I just need to adjust to doing it somewhere else.  It does not help, however, that I do not get service in the break room.  Only out on the smoke deck.

Just turned 30, fed up of being an addict - time to act my age and quit this nonsense!

Hello!


I guess I'm in the same boat as many here: Started smoking at parties when I was young, became a social "habit" at University, and just never stopped. Now I've been smoking for 13 years, and am currently smoking around 15 cigarettes to a pack a day. *regret*


I hate everything about smoking, the cost, the smell, the fact I am killing myself, the pitying looks from non-smokers, **AIRPORTS**, the stress, the coughing, the paranoia about not being able to smoke, but most of all it is really depressing being addicted to inflicting so much unhappiness on myself. 


Like all of you (I assume) I smoke to feel normal, not because I get any pleasure from it whatsoever.


I am 30 now, and enough is enough! Thank you for reading my little vent, I needed to get that off my chest :)

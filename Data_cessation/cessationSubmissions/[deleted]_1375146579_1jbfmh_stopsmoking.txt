I never thought I make it this far

Tomorrow will be day 400. I still don't feel 100% safe in saying that I've quit smoking. In fact, as much as I feel like *bragging* or whatever, I feel like the past couple of weeks have been tough. I'm getting tired of outsmarting my own troll brain.  

I'm nervous about spending time around smokers, about getting drunk, about camping - I just feel on edge. My common sense tells me that this too shall pass. My past experience tells me to not let my guard down.  

I guess I really just wanted to share - to touch base with *someone* who knows what the hell I'm dealing with. r/stopsmoking has been better than anything else for helping me quit. Cheers!

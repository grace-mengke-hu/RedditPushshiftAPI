Dust your self off

We've quit more times than we've ever cared to acknowledge. We have felt defeated even in the beginning of a quit based on all the previous attempts to quit and have failed.

For the first time in my life, I'm allowing that accepting voice inside me to emerge and have some authority in my life. Just because I've quit and failed in the past doesn't automatically mean I'm gonna fail again. The worry, anxiety, craving, confusion, lies, and deceit that come with the process of removing this addiction from our lives will most likely be present yet again. The crucial moment that determines our time smoking or not smoking is the moment we decide how we're going to interpret these feelings and thoughts within us. The feelings and thoughts can be present in our selves, seemingly demanding us to do what it is telling us to do. The action is whether or not we're going to stop by the gas station on the way home or if we're gonna drive by it.

Can we allow ourselves to feel the pains of wanting a smoke without smoking? I think it's very possible we can.

I'm beginning again. My goal is to not smoke. My action is bringing awareness to the pains of readjusting to a smoke free life. Allow myself to think, "AH! I want cigarettes now!!" and have that be the end of it. No further action is necessary. Because I can survive without the smoke. Every single craving is possible to get through without picking up and lighting a smoke. 

I always heard, "you'll quit when you're ready to quit". Are you ready?

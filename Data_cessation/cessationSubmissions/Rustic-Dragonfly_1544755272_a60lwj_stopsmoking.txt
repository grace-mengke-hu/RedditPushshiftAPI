I stopped smoking one drunken night.

I wasn't planning on quitting. I just did. I got drunk one night and looked at my pack and threw them away. 7 years I smoked from aged 12-19. I started far too young. Thought I was cool. Grew to hate it. But could never quit or work up the strength too. Even when I said I would I'd hide a pack away. Well I'm proud to say that I'm completely away from smoking. I don't look back and don't want to. It's behind me. You can do it.

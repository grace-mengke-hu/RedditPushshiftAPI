Any tips?

Today my father went to the doctor. He has a large growth at the base of his tongue. Friday he will have an invasive surgery to remove it where they will go through the front of the throat. The position of the growth is so covered in muscle that they have no choice but to completely sever his vocal chords to get to it. After Friday, my dad will never speak again. 

A dental abscess inflamed by cigarette smoke, I feel like this is my cosmic sign to quit. Not only for myself, but in solidarity with my dad. 

Please give me some tips and tricks to not relapse. I want to be an inspiration to him.

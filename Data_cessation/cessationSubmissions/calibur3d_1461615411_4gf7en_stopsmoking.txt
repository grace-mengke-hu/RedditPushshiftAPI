One year smoke free

When I first stopped, I joined this sub, and I checked it every day just to see my flair and how many days it had been since I quit. After a while, I would only check it every few days, then every other week, then once a month, and here I am at one year. I love the support this community has provided for everyone who seeks the desire to quit, from those just starting out to those who haven't smoked in years. Even those who broke down and had a smoke, you guys would pick them back up and tell them to never give up trying. This sub has had a profound impact on my life this last year and I truly believe without you guys, it would have been much harder to achieve this goal. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

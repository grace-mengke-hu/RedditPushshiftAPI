I relapsed after a month. Badge?

Really not happy about it, but it happens. I've been under a lot of stress but I finally collapsed. Tomorrow (technically today) is a new day. I've never gotten a badge on this subreddit but maybe it's some extra encouragement.   

Keep up the good work, everyone. Just remember... It's okay if it happens. The next day is the start of quitting again. Take it day by day.

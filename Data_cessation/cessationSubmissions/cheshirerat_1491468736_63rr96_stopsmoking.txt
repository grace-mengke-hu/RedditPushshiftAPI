A string of fuck its and 3 days

So sometime last week I got some info on Vuse, both good and bad. next day I was buying my smokes and said "fuck it" and bought one. Figured worst case scenario it doesn't work and I eat 20 bucks. Immediately started vaping in addition to rather than instead of smoking. Fast forward to Monday morning, I'm coming off a shit weekend with the coming week looking to continue the trend, have to wash clothes then go to work, pulled an all nighter and just ran out of smokes. Suffice to day it's about as shit a day and I could anticipate. Figured "Fuck it I got the vape I'll buy cigs later". On the drive I think to myself "Maybe I should quit today, I mean today is gonna blow anyway if i get through today I really don't have much excuse when I have a bad day in the future. And if it's really that bad I can always buy a pack at lunch." 

Lunch rolls around I feel like shit, plan on buying a pack but buy some cartridges instead. On the premise of "Fuck it, it's not like I'm gonna not feel like shit" and "At least I can vape in my car" (bought a car a little while back and decided not to smoke in it). After work I was too tired to stop anywhere so I just when home and slept, but I was slightly proud of myself. 

It's now Wednesday night and I haven't had a cigarette since. I know it's not a permanent solution but it's a step in the right direction. There's no real moral here not actually entirely sure why I'm posting it but fuck it, hope it's a decent read.

Has anyone tried switching to cigars instead of cigarettes?

I've been smoking for a month now. I've been addicted to nicotine since I was 16, turns out I had chronic fatigue caused by sleep apnea (I had big motherfucking tonsils). So I would use it to give me a stimulant throughout the day. I stopped ecigs after 3 years because I could start to feel them having an impact on my lungs. 

Then, I switched to dipping. That only lasted about 6 months because I noticed my gum lines start to recede. I mainly used it to study, then it turned into me dipping all the time. 

About a month ago, after the dipping phase, I started smoking. It started with me bumming cigs and loving them when I was drunk. Also, the meditation and social aspect drew me in hard. Hell, my gf who doesn't even smoke told me I looked hot smoking a cig. That quickly went away when she realized smoking had started to become a problem for me. 

But here I am now, a month into smoking cigs with a huge love/hate relationship for them. I'm thinking about switching to cigars because then I won't be tempted to smoke them all throughout the day. It'll be a once in a while treat. 

Any thoughts?

EDIT: I didn't make it clear in my post but I want to stop smoking entirely. From my own research, I found that cigar smokers are less likely to get lung cancer in particular. So for now, happy to say that this is my last pack of cigarettes. Sad to say that I'm switching to cigars. But, I'm limiting myself to two smaller cigars per week. In the days I'm not smoking at all, I'm going to work on treating the god damn nicotine urges. 

Ice water, chores, deep breathing, running, basketball will all be used to their greatest extent. I'll make a followup post in a month to let you all know if I'm just being stupid or if it actually works to help the cravings and ween me off nicotine.

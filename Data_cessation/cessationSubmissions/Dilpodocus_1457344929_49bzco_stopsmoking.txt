2 weeks going strong!

Its been two weeks since I stopped and I have to thank the SmokeFree ap . Its been so helping showing me how much I've saved and what I am doing to my body that's good because of quitting. 

A list of things I don't worry about anymore

Dying halfway through my run
Reeking of smoke when I get home
Having to cleanse my scent before going home
Being unable to focus at my work
Missing a bus because the cig isnt finished
Panicking that I won't have travel card money and get trappedn in London and die

I'll admit its been hard, especially when my friends smoke but ecigs help and I haven't been to the gym in ages and I just want to kill it when it reopens after the renovation.

Wish me luck!

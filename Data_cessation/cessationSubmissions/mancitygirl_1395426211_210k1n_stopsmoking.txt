11 days of freedom!

Ok. So this was the day I was dreading. My first day alone since I stopped smoking. It was a beautiful day as well, always felt the need to smoke more when it was sunny. Went shopping, and so very nearly caved, stood outside the newsagents trying to reason with myself that one  wouldn't hurt, I deserved it, I could have one to realise it didn't need them any more. It was the devil inside me trying to persuade me. But I beat it, I walked away breathing in the fresh air and I'm so proud of myself that I didn't let myself down. For anyone who is struggling? We all know are hard it is, we all know how much we struggle and we all know how bad the cravings can be. These are cravings, they will pass. However hard it is, take a breath, realise how far you come, don't give in. Not one more puff. Good luck everyone x

Day 3 feeling the difference already

I decided to quit as my birthday present to myself.  I've noticed that the cravings haven't been that bad after the first 24 hours.  Will it get worse or is the first day the hardest?

I feel more focused, sleep better, and have more energy.  Oddly I'm sweating less I didn't even know that was related to smoking, maybe its not directly but I've noticed a significant reduction since quitting a few days ago.  

For those that are curious I am using the patch for about 10-12 hours a day and have gum for the really bad cravings.  I do avoid using gum unless is really bad, consequently I haven't used gum since day 2.

180 days report

This last month everyday is a struggle. I could have given up so many times. But I still said to myself..."let's just get through today"

I quit smoking for a girl I liked...but it never worked out with her. So now I question my reasons for quitting. But today I wrote a list of benefits I see to convince me that I should continue to stay off cigarettes.

Benefits I see and feel:

* The skin in my face is not grey anymore, it now has a natural glow
* the sclera in my eyes is whiter than ever.
* I do not cough in the mornings anymore
* I do not have shortness of breath in the mornings anymore
* and I do not wheez when I breath anymore
* My allergies are suddenly gone
* I now sense the smells of flowers, pine trees when I walk.
* No more stained fingers
* I spray cologne to my clothing and I like the way I smell now
* My mouth is not dry anymore
* I don't have bad breath anymore
* People who know I quit admire me for quitting
* I enjoy a meal at a restaurant without needing to go outside for a cigarette right after I am finished
* I am more relaxed in social situations without having to excuse myself to go outside to have a cigarette
* Travelling with others is much more enjoyable without suffering the withdrawl of cigarettes
* I have more self confidence for quitting smoking
* I feel more self worth for myself

The list of benefits is what really keeps me from smoking. I enjoy my life more. But I do miss that dopamine rush from nicotine. I guess that is why cigarettes are so addictive, because we crave the instant feel good sensation from nicotine. Anyway, that is my 180 day report.

Stopping- Smoker cough

I have stopped for 1 day 3 day as a trial. I know part of the procedure is to in-brainwash yourself. 
However everytime I get a cough from lungs recovering. This can get real bad at work. Serving customers and coughing where I can't talk or my eyes water up. 

What's the best way to combat this? 
I once tried swinging cough medicine which helped a lot not really a fix. 
I can possibly borrow somebody's spare inhaler so the airways stay moist.
Any ideas?

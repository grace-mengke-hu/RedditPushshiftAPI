Gonna try this again.

So 41 days ago, I decided I'd just stop smoking. Then finals began and I caved without even realizing it. Now that final's is over, I'm gonna take another stab at it. This time, with no school since finals are over and summer has arrived, I'm hoping I can handle the cravings, so when my next semester starts, I'll be completely smoke free. Wish me luck!

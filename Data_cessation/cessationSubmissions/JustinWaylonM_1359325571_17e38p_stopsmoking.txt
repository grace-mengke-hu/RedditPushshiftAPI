Just passed 4 months yesterday!

I don't know what to say. There is smoking in every aspect of my life, friends smoke, family smokes, etc. But I'm making it. It's so crazy to think of how horrible I felt so long ago. I used to get Strep Throat every 5 months or so and my face broke out constantly. My face has cleared up, and now that my throat is healing, I can actually start introducing singing into my songs. It only gets easier. 

I literally have no more cravings, and it feels great. And on top of that I have saved nearly $216. Haven't smoked 616 cigarettes. It's surreal.

I hope everyone has such success, I believe in all of you.

We are capable of great things.

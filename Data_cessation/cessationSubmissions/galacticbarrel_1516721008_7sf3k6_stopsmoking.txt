Help - husband lied after 22 days.

Today is day 22, and I found out that my husband didn't quit like he said he did and he's been hiding it from me ever since. Not only is this upsetting to me because he lied (and obviously fighting with him makes me want a cigarette), but knowing he's still smoking has given me the worst craving! I've been thinking about it all morning. I don't want to give in but my brain is so angry with him for lying and I keep thinking "if he can do it why can't I have just a few? He lied to me, I'm upset, I deserve it!" Please help!

Today I start my new life without cigs

I never considered myself a smoker.  For gods sake I just started what 2 years ago and I have smoked in my entire life so far of 22 I would say maybe a maximum of 200 cigarettes.  I started because I love marijuana and since I can't smoke that right now im my life I use cigs for the lightheadedness.  Well I'm done man I don't want to get cancer and die.

I'm going to throw away my Newport 100s soon and that will be that

This is my pain, tobacco withdrawls

Background story, I am a marijuana user. No intentions of quitting the stuff. My struggle comes from about 6-7 months ago when we were introduced to rolling tobacco mixed with weed in a bong bong, commonly known as a Mole (mocha bowl). Anyways, it got to the point where my friends and I were smoking these things once every 45 minutes.

I haven't smoked any tobacco product in 2 weeks, and I have been experiencing OUTRAGEOUS irritability and night sweats. I have been able to manage all cravings by just smoking weed, and I really feel no need to get back into tobacco, however this last Friday I smoked a ciggarrete at a party just for fun. 

Is this going to prolong the time it takes for my withdrawl symptoms to fade? Has anyone else experienced night sweats after stopping smoking tobacco? I just want to know that im not the only one who is going through this, even though I doubt I can be.

Give me your food for thought please! it will mean alot

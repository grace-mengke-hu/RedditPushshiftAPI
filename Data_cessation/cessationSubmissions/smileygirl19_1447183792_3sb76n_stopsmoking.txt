21 days smoke free!

Well, finally hit three weeks! Cravings are gettingvmore manageable every day. I was able to drink without smoking twice. The first time was pretty rough, but the second time was much easier. Got into a big fight with my hubby, and shocked myself by not smoking. Yayy! I think there is truly light at the end of the tunnel. I smoked for 25 years, and quit cold turkey.

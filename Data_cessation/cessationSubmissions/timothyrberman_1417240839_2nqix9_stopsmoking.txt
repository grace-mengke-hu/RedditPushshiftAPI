Smoke free for the past three weeks now

On June 1, 2007, I had quit smoking and that lasted for approximately four years. Since 2013, I had started smoking again and due to being sick for over a week (2014), I had not had a cigarette. Now that I am better, I have no desire for smoking again and have been tobacco free for the last three weeks. This is good because part of my work is to talk with clients about tobacco cessation as part of their own recovery plan.

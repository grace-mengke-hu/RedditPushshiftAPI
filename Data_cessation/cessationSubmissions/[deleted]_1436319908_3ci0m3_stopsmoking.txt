Finally finished Allen Carr's book

I finished it today on the train and most of the book was stuff I was telling myself as I was quitting. It really resonated today though. I'm miserable with my life and I hate where I moved to. As I was walking back to my house I just started crying because i fucking hate it and thought to myself "i could use a cigarette right now" then immediately I was like no wtf is wrong with you that will fix absolutely nothing.

I do kinda miss having something to distract me from how unhappy I am with literally everything in my life though,  lol. I guess it's time to grow up and learn to deal with shit like an adult huh

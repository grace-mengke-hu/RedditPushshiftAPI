I feel like quitting has made my depression worse.

Like I said, I feel like quitting smoking has made my depression worse. I am only 10 days and 7 hours into quitting. I need to know if anyone else with depression has felt like this after quitting. All I ever feel is disappointment and wanting to die and occasionally my brain will ask for a cig. I feel like I wasn't this depressed before quitting, honestly can't remember.

Day 1 for me! Not too excited.

Smoking and I have a love, hate relationship. But I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time from the amount I smoke. I'm 20 years old and I smoke a pack a day easy. I've been doing this for two years and this morning I decided I was done with them. Been wanting to do it for a long time. I could use some words of encouragement if anyone has some to offer!

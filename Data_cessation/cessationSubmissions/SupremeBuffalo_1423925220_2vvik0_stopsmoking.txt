I made it!

So I went to a major party yesterday, and I knew it would be really hard to not smoke, especially when everyone around me is smoking like crazy. Anyways, I made it, haven't taken a single puff. The "alcohol instead of cigarettes" method works, although I ended up in a hospital because of it. Worth it.

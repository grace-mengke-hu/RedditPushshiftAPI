Relapse

Any advice from someone who's been just steps away from a full on relapse but stopped themselves from it?

I've smoked 4 cigarettes on 4 different occasions over the last week. Each time I had a different excuse. I told myself that today is going to be the last one. I'm scared because this isn't the first time I've said this. But I also do feel like this time is different. Anyway, I'm starting over at day 1 because at least for now, today was the last time I will ever take another puff.

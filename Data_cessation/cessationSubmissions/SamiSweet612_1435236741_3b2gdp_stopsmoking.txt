/r/stopsmoking I finally did it! I quit cigarettes!

I did it!!! Thanks to you guys on this subreddit for all of your posts, tips, and advice.

I saw a bunch of mentions of 'The Easy Way' by Allen Carr and although I was doubtful, it really is the easiest and most effective way! I previously tried patches, cold turkey, meditation, hypnosis, and acupuncture (I made it a few weeks to at most 3 months). I also decided to give Wellbutrin/Zyban a try since the reviews are mostly very positive. However the drug and I do not get along well and I experienced very awful side effects for the two weeks that I took it.

I don't know why I never thought about reshaping my thought patterns before but this book has certainly done just that.

Thank you all for the help and support you've given me :-)

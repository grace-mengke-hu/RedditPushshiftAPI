Documentaries about Tobacco Industry, Smoking?

Hi there, I'm coming up on 24 hours smoke free and feeling mad anxious and crawling out of my skin. I've been reading a bunch of posts and comments here, and I so relate to all of them but wondering why the reality of why I'm quitting isn't sinking in. I've set quit dates multiple times in the last few months, but I never last more than 1 day. Last year I watched the documentary Earthlings and immediately went vegan afterwords. It wasn't an easy shift, but I never lacked commitment or resolve because the documentary made such an impression on me. I'm wondering if there's a similar documentary out there that has inspired you all or aided in the resolve to quit and stay smoke free?

My parents don't like the fact that they smoke, but can't kick it.

About a year ago I came home from college, I knew my dad smoked occasionally but he kept it at work and never did it around my mother or I. My mother used to smoke in her teens and 20s, but quit when she was pregnant with me, and didn't smoke except for <10 times over those 21 years. Anyways, when I came home my parents knew that I had taken to smoking a cigar from time to time, and my dad, I guess it was an excuse to do it more, would bring home cigarettes and cigars. With cigarettes in plain view, my mother started smoking occasionally, and it has ramped up over the past year. They have tried to quit several times, and once they're gone my mother would be fine, she can quit on her own. The problem is my father. He will go about a week and then cave, call my mother and ask her if she wants them. Sometimes she'll cave, most of the time she won't. Sometimes even after she says no he'll say "too late, already got them." Honesty it pisses me off that he does this. They both no I am not happy with the fact that they smoke, and I've tried to be supportive of their efforts to quit. When they tell me they're trying to quit and a week later my dad comes home with them, I want to smack him, as my mother has bronchitis and has never been the healthiest. I stopped smoking cigars to help motivate them, but as I am moving out tomorrow to return to college, I don't know what I can do to help them. I would hate to watch my parents' lives be shortened by this.

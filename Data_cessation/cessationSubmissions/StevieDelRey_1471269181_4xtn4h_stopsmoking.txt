I (22F) am trying to quit smoking for the 4th time. Almost 10 hours of no smoking.

I started smoking when I was 20 years old after I fell on some hard times. It started with bumming some off of friends then I was on to buying my own packs. I don't know why I thought this would help me get through my problems. Now that I've overcome my issues, smoking has become the problem. I feel like it is stopping me from being the person that I want to be. For example, I am huge into running but obviously my performance has been declining which I feel is due to smoking. My confidence has also taken a jab. I don't mean to brag but, I do tend to get quite a bit of attention from the opposite sex but smoking is definitely taking its toll in that department too. 

To top off all of that, I have had to deal with mental health issues since I was young. Because of this I have pretty shitty coping skills and stress management. Smoking was always a way of getting out of the house/workplace for a couple of minutes so I could be alone to dwell in whatever I needed to dwell in. Everyone at work smokes and most of my friends smoke too.

I've never been one to open up to people and usually keep to myself. Never have I reached out to anyone about my attempts to quit smoking. My lack of outreach could have also have been a contributing factor to my past quitting failures. I want to try and have a support system this time. I think it will benefit me.

So I don't really have any questions right now. I guess I was just posting because I wanted someone to know that I'm quitting and I mean it this time!

**EDIT**: Thanks for all of the kind comments and encouragement. Support does feel great after all :)

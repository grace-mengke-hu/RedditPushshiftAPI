Day 9 and going strong

Over the last year I have quit smoking for a few months here and there, but always fallen back into it.  This past July I quit buying packs, and would just bum off of my boyfriend or friends.  I would occasionally go a few days here and there without a smoke, but nothing too substantial.  Finally, 9 days ago, I just quit.  I find running to be easier now (duh!) and am glad that I am not a pack a day smoker like I was a couple of years ago.  After 14 or so years of smoking, it feels good to be done.  I'm hoping I can keep this up.  I'm avoiding drinking for now because I know that's one of my triggers.

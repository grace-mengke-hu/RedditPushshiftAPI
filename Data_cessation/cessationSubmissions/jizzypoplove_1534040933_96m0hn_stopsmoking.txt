Day 5. What's next?

Hi everyone.

I'm starting Day 5 of not smoking. I have been a pack a day smoker for about 10 years.

It's been easier than I thought. The cravings haven't been as intense as I expected and I feel healthy overall, mentally and physically.

My question is to experienced quitters and pausers. What happens next in terms of withdrawal symptoms and any other effects? Will it be more or less the same for awhile? I'm sure these things vary from person to person, but I'd like to hear your stories about day 5 and forward in order to best prepare myself for the coming days.

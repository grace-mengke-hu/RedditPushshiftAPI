Quit 17 days ago - coughing question

Hi Folks,
Got a serious cold and somehow didnt smoke for 3 days. Still off them now after 17 days. So got really lucky to not really feel the nicotine cravings. 
Had a major confidence boost yesterday. Went to an all day open air festival, got really drunk but did not feel the need to smoke. Although about 60% of my mates still smoke.
Feel really good about that:)
So now the question, how long did your quiting coughs last? Hardly ever coughed when I smoked but now I somehow keep on coughing
Loads of coughing but not a lot of phlem getting out. How did it work for you?

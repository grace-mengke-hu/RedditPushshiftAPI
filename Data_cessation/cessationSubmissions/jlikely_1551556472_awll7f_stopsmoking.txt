Day One - Attempt 1 Million

For about the millionth time I'm on the couch battling my way through day one. Recently was on the nicotine lozenges but they were messing with my gums and causing a bit of pain in my mouth. Stopped with the lozenge and back came the cigarettes.

Lasted a year with the replacement of lozenge to cigarette. Anybody have any less harmful substitutes or advice on how to trick the mind when a craving hits?

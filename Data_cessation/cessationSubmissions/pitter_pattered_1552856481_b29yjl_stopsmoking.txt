Relieving stress?

I'm a stress smoker. I don't need a cigarette until (usually my job) stress gets to me. Like, haven't smoked for weeks, shit blows up epically, and I find myself borrowing a smoke in the crew smoking area. 
What I'd like to know, is how everyone replaces the habit of using a cigarette to feel calm. What do you use to chill out when SHtF?

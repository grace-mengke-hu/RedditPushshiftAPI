6 days down

Looking forward to tomorrow and being able to say it's been a week !! 

Honestly wasn't sure how this would go and it's not been easy - I've suffered with anxiety in the past and it has reared its head in a big way. Determined though that I will defeat smoking forever !!

Thanks to everyone for the posts on here they've really helped and even made me laugh a few times.

 Good luck all! Xxx

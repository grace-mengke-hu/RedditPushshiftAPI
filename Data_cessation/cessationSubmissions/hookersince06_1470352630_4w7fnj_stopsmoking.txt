Day 2. This sucks.

So, the app on my phone just gave me a badge for being smoke-free for two days.

Whoopty-freakin-doo!

I'm totally freaking out and know my mindset is in the totally wrong place because I'm **MAD** that I don't ever get to have a cigarette again, for the rest of my life.  Normally I'm a pretty positive person but I'm juuuust not feeling it right now. One day at a time right?

**Right?!**

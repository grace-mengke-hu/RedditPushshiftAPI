I quit a few weeks ago because I figured groceries were more important.

Yep. I'm broke as hell and quitting cigarettes seemed like a no-brainer. (I also quit smoking weed, too, that shit is expensive.)

I quit on March 9, so it's almost been a month without them. I can actually breathe and smell and taste things now. It's so refreshing!

I just recently started coughing a lot, which is good. 

Unfortunately all two of my coworkers smoke and sometimes we're in very close quarters and it's gross. I feel like I'm suffocating. I should talk to them, but I haven't yet.

For the most part I've had (mildly) supportive people around me. My family is 100% for it, since I was the only smoker in my immediate family. When I told a coworker I quit he turned around and offered me a cigarette, which I immediately declined with a roaring: *"Fuck no."*

Went drinking with a buddy and he offered me a smoke after I mentioned I quit, too. I declined that one, too, and we're not really friends anymore because he can't respect my decision to quit smoking weed.

Surprisingly annoying cravings and dreams of smoking

I thought they'd stop but they still happen sometimes. Had a good week of minimal cravings, hardly a passing thought. Then bam, walls of cravings for two days, intensifying in evenings and making me sooo crabby. Then dreaming of smoking. Over 6 weeks and really thought this would be over with. It can get easy to get worn down and the high of having quit has worn off a bit. Other people forget youve quit, or don't understand it still is taking energy to stay quit. I truly understand what a beast this addiction is. I am humbled by this. I honor everyone on this journey! It is much easier, but I can see why one must keep being vigilant for a time because the brain starts its tricky addictive thinking at unexpected times. Not caving, just venting. I'm very happy being a non smoker! Woohoo!

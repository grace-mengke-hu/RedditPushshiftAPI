How do I get my mom to quit?

My mom lives far away in the middle of nowhere.  There aren't really hotels to stay at.  If I want to see her I generally get stuck staying at her place for days.  Or she comes to my place for days. 
 
I can't stand being in her house.  After 18 years of being subjected to second hand smoke I am utterly disgusted by it.  She smokes indoors.  It makes me sick.  I don't want to bring my wife to her place, either.  I'm ashamed and embarrassed.

I really don't want my mom coming to my place, either.  When she walks into a room she makes the whole place smell.

I don't know who to tell her that.  I don't know how to explain to her that literally her smoking is damaging our relationship.  I know she'd love to be a bigger part of my life, but her smoking is so disgusting.  The smell is so awful.  It's like trying to have a relationship with a grown adult wearing a diaper full of shit at all times.  

How do I tell my mom she stinks so bad it's preventing us form having a relationship?

Acne after a week

I was wondering why I suddenly started looking like shit. My eyes are bloodshot, my skin looks greasy and full of blemishes, and I'm getting hives all over my back, arms, and chest. Then I realized it was probably my quitting. Any idea how long this will last? I work in sales and looking like a monster does not help my confidence and anxiety when talking to customers all day.

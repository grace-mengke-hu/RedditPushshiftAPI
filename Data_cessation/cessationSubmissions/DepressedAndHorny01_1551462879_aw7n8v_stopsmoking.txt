Just started smoking and need to quit.

Hey, so I'm a college freshman, and on campus there are lots of smokers, so i tried it and became hooked. 

I had like..a pack or two till now, and i decided i need to stop because i started to feel shitty when i don't smoke, it's been 2 days since my last one and i feel like shit and feel the urge to smoke.. withdrawal symptoms? How long do they last? Is there a way to make my life easier right now?

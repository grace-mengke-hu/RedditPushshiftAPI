6 months? 6 months!

 I picked up a lighter the other day and marveled at how foreign this device is to me now, whereas 6 months ago it was an extension of my body. It has not been easy, there have been near relapses, but I can proudly say I feel like Im further and further away from ever going back to smoking. I understand it will be an ongoing struggle at times, but thats a  burden I will gladly take over inhaling tar and hurting my body. I can directly attribute my quitting to reading the stories of others and relating to people on this sub, great community we have here. Even though people move on from this sub, as did I, Ill never forget the resources and help I have received from here. See you guys in 6 months!

I almost drove to buy a pack...

Ugh!  Very close call right now...... I'm having a dinner party with out of town family tomorrow .... I am planning the menu and starting the prep. This is my favorite thing in the world to do! Cook for loved ones!  I get so pumped up. I wanted to smoke to get the mojo going. This kinda snuck up on me.... I did all the tricks... Finally changed my clothes into a dress I can't wear outside the house. (Bra-less... Haha.. Who knew) it worked. Cake is in.... Vodka strawberries marinating..... Check...Stromboli dough kneeding.... I'm cool. Now.
What a test. I kept signing in to read your posts.  Thank you everyone, this subreddit helps me so much! I cannot use this as an excuse.... That's my problem, I'm creating this myself.  Slow down. Dinner party is not important!  My 40 days smoke free ARE IMPORTANT!!!!  Join me in not smoking tonight!!!!!

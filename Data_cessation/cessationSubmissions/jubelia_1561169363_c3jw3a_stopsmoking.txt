Any advice to get my grandma to quit smoking?

Hi all, my grandma is in her early 60s and has probably been smoking since her 20s. I really want her to quit. She's not in good shape. She's got gout, CONSTANTLY coughs and high blood pressure, it's heartbreaking. I've been lucky to have a young grandma, there's a higher likelihood of her being there for things like my wedding day for example (of course I just want to improve her quality of life too). I know that would mean the world to her. But due to her habit, I don't see it happening. 

I tried getting her off by getting her an e-cigarette. It was one of the kinds that you fill the cartridge which you eventually have to replace. But I think that was too difficult for her to operate so she never gave it a shot. I just had the idea to get her an e-cigarette that has those pods that are easy to replace. But I thought maybe it'd be good to get advice from people who've probably tried different nicotine replacement techniques. Even if I got her to cut down, it'd be great. Also, she doesn't like sweet things and I don't really know much about e-cigarette juice flavours so maybe they wouldn't be great for her. 

Thanks in advance :)

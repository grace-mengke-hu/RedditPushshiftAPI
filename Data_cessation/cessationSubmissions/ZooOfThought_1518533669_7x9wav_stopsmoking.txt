Its been more then a year.

I smoked a pack a day for 10 years. If I just knew how easy it could be it would be more then 5 years now. Stop telling yourself its hard to quit,  its not hard. You get irritated a bit and the rest is your mindset. Yeah it sucks when its been 3 months and you still have that wondering thought of lighting up but at that point it's easier not to smoke then it is to feed the craving. To quit I did everything people warned against. I drank,  ate greasy foods,  hung around other smokers,  drove around, and yes it did make it hard for a few weeks but from where I am now I'm so glad I faced the hardest challenges up front. Just don't have the next one.

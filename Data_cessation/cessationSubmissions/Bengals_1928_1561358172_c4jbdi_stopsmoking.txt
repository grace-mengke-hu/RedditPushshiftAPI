New here, Hi!

I’m(23F) currently reaching day 14 of switching from cigarettes to “vaping”. I’ve smoked every day since I was 11, I know it doesn’t amount to what some people have accomplished but this is the longest I’ve went without an actual cigarette in almost 12 years. My question is, what are some tips you guys might have on completely quitting? I’m trying to pace myself so that I don’t give up completely as I’ve done far too many times in the past. Chewing gum had not worked.

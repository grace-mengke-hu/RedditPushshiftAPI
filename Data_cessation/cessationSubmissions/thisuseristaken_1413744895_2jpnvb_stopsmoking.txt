Need some kind of healthy replacement

Hi everybody. So its been two days since I quit, and something I'm finding harder than the nicotine withdrawal is having that feeling where sitting idle without a smoke in my hand just feels weird and really takes away my focus. Do any of you guys have something that makes for a healthy alternative just to keep my mind occupied? I was recommended licorice but I don't want to consume all that sugar either. Any help would be appreciated.

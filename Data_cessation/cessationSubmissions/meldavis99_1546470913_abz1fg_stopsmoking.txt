Day 1: 19 hours strong, but using NRT.

My biggest, immediate goal is to stop smoking. The nicotine weaning hopefully will occur during the time that I break that simple habit. 

I am using nicotine lozenges to quell those cravings, and have some green tea and mint chewing sticks to help with the oral fixation. 

I am in a surprisingly good mood today, although I have been a little foggy. The NRT helps with that, to which I have only had 2 lozenges. 

The slow start at work has helped out a lot. Not as many stressors to react to as I tone down the amount of nicotine I intake. 

My energy level is a bit down and I feel that my allergy congestion is still lingering. That, I assume, is likely to my lungs beginning to clear themselves of the built up gunk from smoking. 

It was surprisingly easy to have my morning coffee and drive to and from work without a cigarette or lozenge. I have been cutting back on my coffee strength the last few weeks too, so there are no surprises there. 

All in all, an okay day.

76 hours with the patch. First time in 13 years that I have made it this far. Wow

I will be honest, I never thought I would make it this far. I tried (a) slowing down (went from a pack a day to just 5), and (b) to quitting cold turkey (made it 21 hours). While I could remove the "fluff" cigarettes, I just could not remove the critical ones (the ones that will make your skin crawl without). Finally, I bought the patch (step 2) as another attempt to get away from it. I am at 76 hours, and doing ok (I morn my stupid evil friend). 

I am learning new ways that my mind fights me (smart mind knows every trick to fight me). The first two days were hard to get use to the patch (learned that have cigarettes at all around me was really dumb). The 76 hours is the amount of time I have had zero cigarettes. I can smell the smoke, and to be honest it is disgusting already to smell. I am getting better, day by day.

I am writing this just to get my thoughts and feelings down on paper. I ponder how this evil product is still allowed, and how I got here. I do not want to smoke, I just have to make it hour by hour, day by day. I know the stats, and if I can make it just 2 years then my chances of going back to that life are significantly reduced.

I will win, I have to win, I want to live. Thank you.

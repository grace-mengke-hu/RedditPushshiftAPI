Almost at 2 weeks! Need to vent a little.

Somehow week 2 was harder than week 1! Fewer cravings, but I I'm just getting a little tired of the whole "Welcome cravings because every craving resisted is a huge victory" frame of mind. It's still true, but it's lost its charm, really.  

I have a very busy/stressful next couple of months:
1. A couple of parties this weekend. Alcohol and social settings are tough. 

2. Travelling next week. Flying and travel in general is really stressful for me. 

3. Grandma is on the way out. (It's ok. She's 93 and is very ready to go.) Funerals and family are sad/stressful.

4. General Holiday fun/nonsense.

5. School just started up again, and I'm taking a heavy course load. 

6. Powerlifting competition in 6 weeks. I'm coming in VERY heavy for this competition (20 lbs and climbing!) Its becoming pretty obvious that I'm going to have to go up a weight class. Not the end of the world, but it sucks that I'm training my ass off and dieting hard, but I'm still gaining weight.  Cigarettes definitely increase your metabolism.


It's actually good that I'm busy and stressed. The only thing that makes me want to smoke more than stress is boredom. I'm not going to be bored for a while, that's for sure!

This subreddit is an inspiration.

I quit smoking on Feb 7th of this year and it has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’m not super active in this community although I always try to post words of encouragement when I’m around. But you guys are an awesome group of people.

Over the last 3 months I’ve really turned my life around in some good ways. I’ve started working out on a regular basis, I’ve been eating much healthier, I’ve quit smoking, and I’ve starting cooking most of my own meals just to name a few.

This community inspired me to do these things and more. I feel like I’m finding the drive, determination, and confidence I had years ago as an 18 year old again. Which is something I had lost over the last 5 years of my life due to some unfortunate circumstances.

The positivity you guys are overflowing with has helped me lift myself out of depression and many bad habits. Thank you all for being the amazing people that you are.

Whether you’re new here and have had many day 1s of failed attempts to quit smoking or you’ve been a non smoker for the last 5 years, just remember, this is all worth it. You are so much more than just a passing nicotine craving.

I can’t speak for everyone out there but for me this has been about learning to love myself. My past is me but it doesn’t define me. It’s never too late to make positive changes.

Sorry for the quick stream of consciousness but I just had few things I wanted to say.

Take everything one day and a time and you’ll get better and better one day at a time.

Will i stop enjoying things after quitting?

So for example everyday when i wake up i brew myself a cup of coffee, grab my headphones and cigs and start listening to music, walking around and just enjoying myself, but its hard for me to imagine enjoying this without smoking. Is this just my mind telling messing with me so i don't quit or will i really stop enjoying things like this?

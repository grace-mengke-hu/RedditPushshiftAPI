[New to reddit - not sure if this is the right area. anyways..] How long after you quit should you expect the smell from your breath and fingers to go away?

Long story short, I'm encouraging my girlfriend to quit before a habit turns into an addiction. She said her last one was wednesday night and I do believe her but I just keep thinking about the fact that i definitely smelled the faint smell of cigarettes on her fingers as well as a bit on her breath. I mentioned this to her but she was very insistent that what she was saying was accurate. I didn't want to question her too much because then it looks like I think she's lying and probably would just stress her out even more.

Also relevant, I am working out of town for the next while and have been for the last couple weeks. Only see her fri-sun.

How long should it take for the smell on her fingers and breath to go away?

(sorry if it's a stupid question but I've had other friends start smoking and I didn't say anything and I really really regret that. I'm not making the same mistake again especially with someone I care about like her)

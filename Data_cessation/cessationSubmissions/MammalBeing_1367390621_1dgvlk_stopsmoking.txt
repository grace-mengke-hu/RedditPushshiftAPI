I want to stop smoking because I know how much it's affecting my health. One problem though...

My problem is that I actually like the way certain cigarettes do taste. I have been smoking American Spirits recently and somehow they make me smoke less. But I like the way it tastes and burns, no matter how much I want to quit. 

Any advice for my problem? I've been smoking for 13 years.

100 day club

Made a 100 days today...wow, after 10 years.  I woke up and just decided to quit without a necessary reason.  In the meantime I've been around a lot of smokers, chain-smokers, etc., but never felt tempted.  What has helped me most of all is exercising an hour a day minimum...my new addiction.  thanks and best of luck to everyone out there trying to quit.  It's hard but so many things do eventually improve

Boobs

Quitting so I can have a breast augmentation that I have wanted ever since I knew what tits were. I thought itâ€™d be easier with such incentive but, of course not. The sweats, loss of sleep, moodiness, irritability, is so real and I find myself begging for a puff. Been a smoker for 12 years. HEEELLLLP

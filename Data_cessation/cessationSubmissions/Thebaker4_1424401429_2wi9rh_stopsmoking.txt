Really need help on quitting. (Long read)

I've been smoking since I was about 14. I'm now 19. I started using an ecig when I was 18 because I thought I was bad off smoking 2 cigarettes a day. I smoke Natural American Spirits. I also grow my own tobacco (agronomy major). My dad had a heart attack when I was 5 (he was 40). After that he still smoked 2 packs a day. He got on Chantix when I was 15 I believe. I saw it really changed him because he was depressed and not sleeping but he's been cigarette free since then. My brother's mom died in October due to a heart attack (we have different moms). All 3 of my brothers have quit smoking since then. I was born 2 months early and my lungs are effected due to that. I started vaping heavily and got to 36 mg nicotine. I am now probably a pack a day smoker. I smoke 3-4 cigarettes depending on how stressed I am from school but still use my ecig pretty much non stop. I can't go long at all with nicotine. Maybe an hour or two. I would like to get on Chantix. Do y'all think it's a good idea for me? I take Zoloft due to depression caused by my anxiety as well. I've quit opiates and benzos in the past but I really can't quit smoking. Thanks for reading.

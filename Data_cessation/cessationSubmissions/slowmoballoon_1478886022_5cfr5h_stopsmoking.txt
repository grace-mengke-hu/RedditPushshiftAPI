Life happens

Since I have quit smoking 53 days ago, my world feels like it's falling apart a little more each day. I'm craving a cigarette so bad that I am tempted to pick up a butt off the ground and smoke it. I still haven't smoked but the disgusting urge is still there.       

In these 53 awful days, I have racked up more debt than I ever could imagine. I shit blood. Visited the ER. Had an endoscopy. I can't eat cheese anymore. I may have Crohns. I was kicked out of my apartment. My ex roommate is harassing me. My ex roommate is refusing to give me my rent and deposit back. I filed a lawsuit. My car battery fried and died. I failed an assignment. I missed an exam. I signed up for therapy. I only see hate everywhere. I'm a fucking mess. But I'm still trying.      

I'm sinking. I feel like I'm drowning. And my new therapist says: "This too shall pass." And I want to punch him.       

Any advice. I'm sinking :(

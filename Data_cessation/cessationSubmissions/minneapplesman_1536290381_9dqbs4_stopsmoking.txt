Are withdrawals better or the same if you taper?

Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been smoking for about 8 years, went 2 years free but got back on the wagon around 4 years ago when I thought it would be ok to just have one when a friend offered.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently went from around 14 cigs a day to about 6-7 without thinking about it as my stress level at work went way down. I figured I might as well quit. Went cold turkey for around 4 days but I found myself being a huge asshole to my wife. Decided if I smoke once in the afternoon before getting home I would be much better tempered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does a gradual reduction in nicotine have any impact on nicotine withdrawals? Am I just prolonging my nicotine withdrawals if I smoke once a day or will it help my mood gradually adjust to being smoke free? I'm angry in the morning before I smoke my afternoon cigarette as well as snacking like crazy all day.

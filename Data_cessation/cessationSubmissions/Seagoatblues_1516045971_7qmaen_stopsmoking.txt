I’m almost 2 months cigarette free after 10 years of smoking.

Just wanted to thank everyone for recommending Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking. This is the longest time I’ve ever been smoke free since starting. If you’re still trying to quit, I highly suggest that you give the book a try. Here are some cool things that have happened since I’ve stopped smoking: 

•I can feel my hands again/ they aren’t ice cold. My circulation came back very shortly after quitting. 

•I don’t smell like smoke anymore. Neither do my clothes.

•My teeth are whiter and my gums already look healthier

•My diet has improved and I don’t skip meals anymore. 

•Strangely enough, I feel more confident and in control of my life. 

•oooooh that smell, can’t ya smell that smelllllll? Seriously though, I smell EVERYTHING 

If you want to quit, you can do it. 
Don’t underestimate the power of your mind. 

I am really looking forward to seeing more benefits as I continue to be a nonsmoker. 
 
Thanks again, r/stopsmoking!

Preparing

Hi there, first things first. My English isn’t that great 🤙🏼 but I just quit smoking in my car for 3 days now and I really enjoy the rides to everywhere I go again without the smell. Only I don’t have the right mindset to stop again. I read the Allen Carr book , vaping, stoped with pills also cold turkeys but still a smoker. 

I like this sub a lot lately, enjoying your story. Some are inspiring, and with some I can “see myself”. 

I smoke a package a day and in the weekend with some alcohol it can be 2/3 packages. Feel bad for myself and people are with me at that moment. 

To be honest I can’t wait to be a “non-smoker” back to the good old days when I didn’t have the carvings for nicotine. But again don’t have the right mind set. Do you have any “tips and tricks” for me? 

Thank you😘

15yo trying to quit. Help please :)

I've been on this website quite a lot during the past week or so- specifically on /r/stopsmoking. I'm a 15 year old boy and sadly have been smoking for 3 years or so and have always knew I needed to quit but I would 'forget' the next morning that I had quit the night before, and smoke a cigarette in the morning. (15-30 min. after I woke up) My nicotine addiction is mild but my mental addiction is far worse. I assume, during the most important years of the brain's development, mentally I am a smoker and always will be. But I haven't ever really tried before and now I'm 24 hours in without a cigarette. Also haven't smoked pot in 24 hours, but that addiction is far less significant, at least to me. Despite my short term memory completely destroyed where several times a day I'd forget what I'm trying to say mid-conversation.  Even though I'm looking for help, I'd like to give some advice to you guys. Check out Stoicism philosophy. It's a great self-improvement, mind altering, brain training philosophy used by many; and formed in the Rome's prime. Julius Caesar even followed the philosophy, up until his death. 

My best self-tip is a non-smoker DOESN'T smoke. There's no negative affects of becoming a non-smoker, health wise. BUT I constanlty needed to tell myself today to suck it up, and don't let yourself down. I just don't know how long my motivation will win the fight. AGAIN, I'm only on the first day, trying to convince myself one at night isn't too bad. BUT, fuck that. I'm almost passed one day. Suck it up, you pussy!

SO IN CONCLUSION, I have severe problems with boredom, or atleast I did on my first day, which is today. :( I try and remind myself this isn't abnormal and the brain needs to get used to the 'non-smoking' lifestyle. But, when you quit, how did you occupy your time? 

THIS IS MY FIRST POST BE NICE :) much love

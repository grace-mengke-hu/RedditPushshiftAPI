So I took a puff the other night...

because my friend passed me her rolled cigarette instead of the joint we were sharing, and I didn't notice until I had already inhaled. It was gross. I immediately went to brush my teeth, and she was extremely apologetic. It was an honest mistake. As weird as it may sound, I'm chalking this up as a victory. There was nothing inside me that wanted anything to do with that. I'm a non-smoker. A non-smoker who will no longer be sharing joints with someone who is simultaneously smoking a cigarette. Just wanted to share this and wish everyone good luck!

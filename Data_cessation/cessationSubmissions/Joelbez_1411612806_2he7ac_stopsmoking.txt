4 days free, and I feel good.

I've smoked since I was 21 years old. Yes, when I started drinking (I actually waited till i was 20, but was able to buy my own at 21), I picked up the habit of smoking. My mom and dad smoked when i was a child, but my mom was able to kick it. My dad told us he'll likely die with a smoke in his hand.

Fast forward almost 7 years and here I am. My lung capacity is garbage, making softball tough to play and I'm not even in bad shape. My clothes smell like trash because of that stale, nasty stench. My beard stinks and my wife rarely kisses me (not because of the whiskers, she digs em). My daughter doesn't seem to mind, but she doesn't know any better, being 9mo. old.

I'm a big gamer, as I've been playing since I was about 4. It's what I do to keep out of trouble. I play from 0-4hrs a night after my wife and daughter go to bed, and my computer is getting kinda crappy for its age. I wanted a PS4, my wife said no. I offered to quit smoking ahead of when i had originally planned if she'd authorize the purchase after I worked the OT.

I realize there are people who think that my wife/kids should be enough of a reason to quit, and that quitting for something material is just going to make me relapse, but that's not the case here.

I'm tired of my jackets and coats smelling like smoke. I'm tired of wasting money on cigs. I'm SICK and tired of being winded after running 4 bases. I don't want my daughter to grow up thinking it's ok to ruin your lungs.

My aunt Pegi died about 6 years ago from Emphysema and breast cancer. She could have beat the cancer because it was fairly early, but the emphysema was what killed her.

I miss her, and I always will. I refuse to put my daughter through that. I won't let my shitty habits ruin her childhood because "daddy had to go smoke."

I'm 4 days smokeless, cold turkey, and I'm going to beat this shit.

Thanks guys.

anxiety anyone?


Here is my post from the anxiety subreddit:

Can anyone relate to this? That smoking could be the culprit here?
I was a non-smoker for 2 years after 15 years of shame, now I have smoked about 6 months again, 2 months maybe a pack a day.
Did you ever feel fine and dandy in the mornings, then took a cig and it was all downhill from there (anxiety-wise)?
Has anyone had some sort of constant state of anxiety/panic because of the cigs?

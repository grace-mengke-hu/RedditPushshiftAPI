First attempt questions

So I've decided to try and quit smoking. I am a 22 year old male, been smoking for a few years about 10 cigarettes a day. 

My main problem is I like going out on weekends and find myself smoking a pack a night when drinking. I can't imagine going out without smoking... Any suggestions on how to help solve this problem? 

Also will I always want a cigarette when I am drinking or will that eventually subside? 

Cheers

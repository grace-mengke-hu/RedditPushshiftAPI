Just starting.

Well hello there. I started smoking a few months ago during Air Traffic Control  school to help me calm down and relax. I'm not part of that school anymore, but I've still got those urges for a cig every now and then. I know the health risks, and I want any and all help to quit for good. I've tried cutting down, and vaping. Didn't really help. Lots of advice and tips would be very appreciated.

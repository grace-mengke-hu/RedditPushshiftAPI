Using dreams [update]

I was having issues with dreaming about smoking. It would give me a complete sense of guilt and wake up in a cold sweat.

I thought I would update since my previous post.  Now that I have been smoke free for a month and a half, I had a dream that I told someone that I quit smoking. I consider this a huge achievement!

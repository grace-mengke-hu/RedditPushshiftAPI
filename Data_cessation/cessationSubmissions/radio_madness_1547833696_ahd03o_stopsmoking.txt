2 days in. Anxiety sucks

I'm actually quitting because it triggers my anxiety, but right now the withdraw is triggering it just as bad (I also quit caffeine at the same time too). I don't want to smoke, just want my anxiety to go away.

Keep at it everyone! We can do this together. You can be 2 minutes, or 2 decades into your quit, you're always doing the right thing!

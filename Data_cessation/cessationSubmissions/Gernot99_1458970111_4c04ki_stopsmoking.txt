1 month smoke free SOO WORTH IT - here some stats and how I feel.

I stopped cold turkey a month ago. I decided to go cold turkey because I wanted to experience those cravings, mood swings, anger and frustration in order to (hopefully) never start again and never again let addiction dominate my body and brain. Additionally I wanted to get that nicotine out of my body ASAP. I am by far not there yet after a month, I still have cravings, I still have sometimes that itchy feeling to having a smoke, but I keep telling myself: I do not smoke and then those 2-3 minutes of cravings pass. 
I thought I post some stats after 30 days of quitting for those here who need additional motivation (I smoked more or less a pack a day):
Time not spent smoking: 50h,
Money saved: 175 EUR,
Cravings resisted: 150,
Hours smoke free: 720,
Cigarettes not smoked: 600,
CO not inhaled: 6.000mg,
Circulation improved: 35%.  
I think those number are really shocking, cannot believe that I waited so long for finally doing this step and stop inhaling those cancer sticks.
If I could do it for a month, everyone here can do it - let's just keep the golden rule: not another puff, no matter what.

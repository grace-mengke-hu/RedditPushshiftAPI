Quit smoking on new year's eve along with hundreds of thousands of other people. The trick to being successful is never having a single smoke again.

I have struggled to quit smoking cigarettes on and off for the past 10 years.  I quit over a year ago only to start back smoking after a tough breakup.  There is NO excuse for having another smoke after you've quit.  If you have ONE, you will end up right where you left off when you quit smoking.  I had a cigarette that was offered to me at a concert one night, then the next day I started bumming from friends at work.  Less than a week later, I bought my first pack in over a year and undid all of the hard work I put in trying to quit in the first place.

This time, I will quit smoking forever.

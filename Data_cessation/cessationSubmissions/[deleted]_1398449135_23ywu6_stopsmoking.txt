Day 8...

So, it's day 8. Everyone at work is very encouraging. I was able to drive some non-smoking coworkers to Friday afternoon lunch today which is something I would have never done when smoking. My car still kinda smells like smoke.. but it's way better and my coworkers were very tolerant. They know I'm quitting so I'm guessing they are trying to be supportive by driving with me.

My boss keeps saying how brave it is that I'm making this change (I'm also getting gastric bypass surgery which is part of the reason I quit smoking) and, while I do appreciate the kind words and encouragement... I don't feel "brave". I feel more desperate than anything. Before quitting smoking I felt like I was literally going to drop dead at any moment from a heart attack, asthma or cancer.

Today, I breath MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH easier and feel SOOOO much better. I mean.. in only 8 days I've gone from barely able to walk without getting winded and "holding the wall up" while catching my breath... to walking everywhere with little problem and it doesn't phase me one bit. No struggling to breath... no feelings of almost having a heart attack.

BEST... DECISION... EVER!!!

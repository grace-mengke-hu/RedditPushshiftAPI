124 days and getting tougher.

I don't know if anyone else has had this but I've stopped smoking for 124 days. I didn't struggle to start, there was no pining, I was ready to stop. 
I have been getting some very strong cravings. More so than at the start. The temptation to just have one is very strong. 
It feels strange that the cravings are getting stronger the longer I stop. Is this something others have dealt with?

best decision of my life

I've been smoke free for over a month now.
Stopping smoking was the best thing I've ever done.  I feel sooo much better.
I was in mild depresion before quitting but didn't want to admit it. I was always quitting what ever I was doing or got excited about, now I feel so much more focused and determined.
I am a lot more positive, anything bad that happens I know it's not the end of the world and that I have evrything that I need. I am so happy, I am very grateful for the position I am in, even though my parents are a bit conservative it could be much, much worse. I don't have the right to complain.
I have changed so much since quitting smoking. Every aspect of my life has improved.
I even got money to upgrade my pc.
I realized a big thing about myself, I was deppresed because I was doing what others expected me to do. I was a programmer, I was a smoker, I was this and that.

Quitting smoking made me realize that I don't have to identify myself with such labels even though others label me that way.

All that I've said pulls so many strings that I have yet to unravel, Since I'm positive and feel that I have everything that I need I'm not forcing and pushing my gamedev for money so I can move out. I am doing it because I had a cool idea or something, and that gave some great ideas, my creativity has boomed.
I enjoy life and art and music, everything is better.
I am so happy I want to cry.


I usually don't post things anywhere, but this time I had to post this in hopes it motivates someone or gives them hope ;)
thank you.

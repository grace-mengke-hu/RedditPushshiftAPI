Feeling great

I’m 18 days strong. I smoked for 4 years and this is the first time I have ever quit and I can’t imagine lighting up... I’m disgusted by them now. I have quit cigarettes but am currently using a nicotine replacement in e cigs when I get a bad craving but I’m not using it as much as I thought I would. I feel like my lungs open up wider when I do breathing techniques for stress..and I can do more cardio at the gym..and best of all, I don’t have to stand out in 30 degree weather to get my fix.

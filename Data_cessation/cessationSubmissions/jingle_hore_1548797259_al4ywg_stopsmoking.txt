1 month, 6 days, 5 hours plus a lot of anxiety

This is my 4th time trying to quit, and my second longest attempt. I'm having crazy cravings today that won't go away. Anyone else have anxiety as a trigger? I went off my anxiety meds because my hair was falling out, and no way to change meds because I lost my insurance. How do you manage your anxiety in a way to not give into the cravings?

When waking up, sensation to still be a smoker

Hi guys, 22/23th day (I have to see my badge after posting this) . Feeling proud of myself and generally feel good. But each morning I wake up, my mouth smells like I have smoked a pack each past day. Can you relate with this? It's not a really shitty feeling, but neither a good one , hope it goes better.

Have a nice day!!☺️

One week today!

In times past when trying to quit, I would brag to friends that I was at 'one week' or 'two weeks' without smoking but that was with the occasional drag off of others smokes but this time, I haven't had even a drag in a week :) I went to work last night, which is the hardest place for me to resist, and even though I wanted one Hella bad, almost sweating the craving was so bad, I just walked around the parking lot for my break and went back in and worked twice as hard. This is the very beginning of a long and hard journey but I'm glad to be able to genuinely brag about my progress, thanks everyone for the support that has gotten me to where I am

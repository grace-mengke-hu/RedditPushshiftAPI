It feels like i lost a huge part of my identity

I know it might sound weird. I had my last smoke 35 hours ago and i am using 21mg patches. I used to smoke for almost 18 years, since i was 14. A big pack a day (27 smokes). The patches are working a lot, my cravings are down to a minimum and i notice that right now, its mainly the habit that i miss. 

But the thing that makes me so sad, is the feeling that i lost a huge part of my identity. I dont feel like myself. Smoking suits me so well and i am wondering of this feeling will passðŸ˜ž

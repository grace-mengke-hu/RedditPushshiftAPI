40 days and counting

I would like to think I finally did it!  40 days is the longest period of time I haven't smoked since 2006.  I've noticed I feel a lot and I mean a lot better now that when I started.  I don't suffer from headaches nearly as much, and I feel fresh when I wake in the morning.  My lungs don't feel as tight as they used to.  And most importantly my children will never know their father smoked!  I wish you all luck in your quit and I'll be here to repost as I go!

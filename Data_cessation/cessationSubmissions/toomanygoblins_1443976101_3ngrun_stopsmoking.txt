Everyone around me smokes...

Hey I was hoping someone in a similar situation could give me advice. I quit smoking about 4-5 months ago (don't remember, don't keep track). After that I quit weed about 2 months ago. But none of this is fun, makes me happy, or is satisfying. Everyone around me smokes, I think I have two friends that don't smoke and those friends smoke weed regularly. My girlfriend smokes both. I'm starting to lose enjoyment hanging around my friends and girlfriend because I just have to struggle in my head and sit there with a smile on my face, last night I told her I was having a hard time with it and she cried about how she is bad for me and I ended up taking care of her then I went to bed and had 3 dreams (nightmares) last night about smoking. 

I don't want to just be by myself all the time but I'm exhausted from being around anyone in my life who does these things. I can never relax around my friends or girlfriend. Maybe I'm exaggerating because last night was so hard but this fucking sucks. It would be so easy to just buy a pack and just blend in again, don't worry I won't but I need some suggestions, advice or just words because I'm running ragged.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the words, it was exactly what I needed I don't like to ask my friends for help so I guess I needed an outlet. I'm gonna continue walking this path smoking wont make me happier and I only know that it will lead to regret maybe not tomorrow or the next day but eventually.

Hooray for all the New Quitters Here! You're Making A Great Decision!

It wasn't all that long ago when I took my last drag from a cigarette after smoking heavily for years and years.  I have almost zero regrets in my life except for starting smoking so young.  

It gets easier, but one needs to stay resolved.  Each craving at a time, transcend it whatever way works for you best.  Breath is life and and smoking takes the breath away.  Breathe deep now that you are non-smoker and feel your body smile.

Day 4: feeling grumpy, temptation setting in

I used to smoke around ten per day but decided to quit for my lifeguarding course, I'm feeling grouchy and I can tell its having an affect on people around me. Did you guys feel the same? 

Also worried I'm being tempted into asking my friends who smoke for a cigarette next time we're drinking. The whole 'one won't hurt' mentality; can you still be a quitter and socially smoke once in a blue moon?

Thanks for reading and good luck if you're in the process!!

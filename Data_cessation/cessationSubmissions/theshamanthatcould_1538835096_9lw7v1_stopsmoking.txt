I think I can do this

I've tried so many times, but a lot has changed since my last attempts. Things have been moving up for me for a long time now. The previous problems in my life are so much better. Not being able to save is a big problem, but if I were to quit buying nicotine or wait to pay off some debt, maybe I could. Telling my niece how drugs are terrible, yet pulling out lozenges is embarrassing beyond belief.

My mate's aunt died recently, I want to do this in her memory also. She was incredibly unhealthy and died in a diabetic coma like a month ago, it was really hard to watch over the year's I've known her. That really drove me to really think about quitting again. I want to live a long time, and not just another half of my life at this point.

Lozenges are hidden by my mate right now, I have no idea where they are. My mate thinks I should never throw cigarettes or anything away that can be used, so I agreed to it. Give me your voodoo, I know this is it :-)

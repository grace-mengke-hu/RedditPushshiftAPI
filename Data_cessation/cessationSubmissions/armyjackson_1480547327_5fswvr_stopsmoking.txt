100 days...

I can't believe i've made it 100 days.  
My history-
Born to a smoker
Raised in a smoker's house
Started smoking at 14
Tried to quit several times. 
Smoked as much as I possibly could til I met my husband 6 years ago.  
Started using the nicotine patches.  They worked pretty well except for when they fell off, or were sweat off.  Did that for 5 years which kept me from smoking as much, though I did still smoke occasionally.  
114 days ago I started Chantix.   100 days ago, I quit Chantix.


It's still hard.  I get grumpy at times for no reason.  I know that if I had one cigarette I would feel so damn good.. but I'd be stuck in that routine again.. 

Best thing that I've noticed in these 100 days is that I don't get sick as often anymore. 

If I can do this, you can do this.  
I did not think I could do this.. I believed that because I was surrounded by it my entire life, I couldn't do it. 

You can do it.   It's not easy.. but you can.

My little method of quitting whenever I got in the habit

I like smoking socially, and have stretches of time where I like smoking when I'm working on something because it would force a break of what I was doing and reboot my mind.  I would inevitably have cravings at what I would think were personally inappropriate times, and when I would smoke because I thought I needed to, I really didn't like it because it's a drug that has a physical effect on you.  That was the realization that really made me dislike what I was actually doing once I was losing control.  So, once that realization kicks in, it's not that hard for myself to want to quit.  It's like taking a drug break which makes it more sordid than just a smoke break.

My trick that has always worked is if I want to smoke, I tell myself later.  When I would have a craving, I would associate that feeling with postponing actually smoking.  That gave me enough incentive to wait.  This would allow the craving to subside until I was clear-headed enough to feel like I had a rational choice and I would choose not to smoke at that point.  Next craving comes, I would postpone it, up until the point that the postponing of smoking was associated with the craving, so I would essentially never smoke.  The postponing break was, in some way, psychologically as fulfilling as smoking.

I believe this creates a little mental trick to not feel like I was depriving myself of something I enjoyed, which I could never really justify for my own well-being (I guess I'm a bit nihilistic). 

Anybody else ever use this same method?  I find it very effective so I thought I'd put it out there.

*I want to add that not smoking actually feels really good compared to smoking so that would be the primary motivation behind all of this, anyway. I would compare how I felt smoking to not smoking, and not smoking physically and mentally feels so much better, so I don't enjoy smoking beyond certain situations  (like drinking/hanging out).

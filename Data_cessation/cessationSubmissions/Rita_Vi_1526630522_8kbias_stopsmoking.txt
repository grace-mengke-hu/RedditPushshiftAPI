Can you get addicted being a year smoke free after smoking just one cigarette?

Do you think that after all this time you have much stronger will and can stop after one cigarette? 
I quit 1 year and 3 months ago and haven't had a puff but I was just wandering if it gets easier for those who had a puff. Thoughts and/or stories??

Another random benefit to quitting...

It's that time of year again for the wildfire smoke. I live in a small city in the Rocky Mountain West, and it's in a valley where the smoke from all of the regions wildfires just sort of collects and sits over the entire city. Every year. For like all of August and September.

Usually this is the worst time for a smoker, because the wildfire smoke in the air just exacerbates all of the damage you are already doing to your lungs, and everything burns, and you feel sick all the time. But I've noticed a huge difference now that I'm not a smoker anymore.

Just one more thing to add to the long list of benefits of being a non-smoker!

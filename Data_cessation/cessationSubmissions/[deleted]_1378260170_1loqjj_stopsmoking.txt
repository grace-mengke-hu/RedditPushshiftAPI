Surrounding environments that don't help

I've been smoking for over 8 years now, and I haven't tried quitting yet. But I'm truly considering it.

The only thing I'm afraid of is the people I'm constantly surrounded by. Most of my friends smoke, everyone at my work smokes *inside*, at home literally everyone smokes, the places I go to for fun and chilling out, serve shisha. In my country smoking should be banned in doors, but it's not really enforced, so even in public places people smoke, and here, 29% of the people smoke, where I'm sure most of them are heavy smokers.

So what has been bugging me is that even if I tried to quit, the environments I'm constantly in won't be helping at all, and would be very unaccommodating, and the support I should probably get from my family and friends will be counter productive. 

Any suggestions on what I can do?

**TL;DR** Everywhere I go people smoke, and almost everyone I'm close to smokes. How can I remain strong once I decide to quit?

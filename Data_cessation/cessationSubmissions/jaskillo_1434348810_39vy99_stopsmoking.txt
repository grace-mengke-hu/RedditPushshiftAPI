Had nose surgery, dying for a smoke

I've decided that this surgery should be the point where I stop smoking. I've been cig free rot he last to days while I prepared for surgery and had hedaches, rage fit's, the works. My wife has been very supporting. I tried to sneak for a cig and she got really mad and that made me decide I was dropping the habit. Any pointers?

Currently on 3rd day smoke-free after 30 years. Found some Nicorette gum from a previous attempt. Used it up and just bought some more.

Strangely enough, leading up to quitting, I would have the urge to smoke, light it up, then NOT ENJOY IT. Got my intake down to 3 - 8 cigs a day prior to quitting. I believe my withdrawal is predominantly psychological, not physical. 

I have the urge to smoke a few times a day, but follow up that urge with the memory of how I DO NOT ENJOY the actual act of smoking. Thus far, that has quelled the urge.

This morning I got up and 'forgot' I usually smoked with my coffee. It was weird but good (until I remembered, lol.)

On a previous iteration of this goal, I quelled the 'smoke while I drive a car' urge by pretending to smoke a carrot strip. I got a lot of raised eyebrows from passing motorists. Do I care? 

Please hold me accountable and/or give me some tips that are helping/have helped you!!!

Question for the ones who used the patch.

I haven't had a cigarette in two weeks. I'm on the step 3 of the nicotine patches, though and using them only when I have a really bad craving (the majority of my family smokes and the temptation is always in a drawer somewhere). It was very difficult for me to quit and the patches helped tremendously. I even went a few days without them before a rough day hit. So a question for you patch users. How was it getting off the nicotine stickers completely? I know 7mg isn't much, but nicotine is still nicotine in my mind.

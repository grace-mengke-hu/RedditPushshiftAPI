Journal

Like many others, I decided to throw away my packs and start a smoke free 2014.  
  
It has now been 24- hours of smoke free living. Badgebot will start day 2 some 4- hours from now I think.  
  
I'm thinkin I'll update this journal as time goes by and when I have something to say. Heres my thoughts:  
  
**Day 1**  
First day has been flying by with a hangover from new yeasrs party.  
This has truly been a blessing, topacco is not the first thing on my mind now :D  
  
I did start a new habbit at home. When ever I get the feeling "I need a smoke" I go and start playing piano for some 5-10 minutes. This seems to help a lot.

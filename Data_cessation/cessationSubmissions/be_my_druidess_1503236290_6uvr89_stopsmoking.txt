Smoking my last

I'm sitting in my car on my break at work smoking the last cigarette in my pack. I don't want to buy more. I know I don't want to smoke anymore. My chest hurts, it's too expensive and I'm in my 30's now and don't want wrinkles. My problem is this fear that I can't quite pinpoint. What am I scared of? I'm not sure but I am. Really scared. What do I do when I'm stressed? How will I spend my breaks now? I've been smoking for almost 15 years. How do I fill that time? I quit once before about 10 years ago for 6 months...then went to a family reunion. Went right back into the habit. Any advice would be much appreciated. I really want to do this I'm just not sure of how to stick with it.

Thanks for all the suggestions! I can't wait to start keeping  track of all the money I'm not spending!

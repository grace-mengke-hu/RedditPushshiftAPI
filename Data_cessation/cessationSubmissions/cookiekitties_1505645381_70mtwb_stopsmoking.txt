Smoke-free for 4 days and no one is caring.

Hi everyone! 
I decided to stop smoking after I went to Iceland and had amazing adventures that led me to cut back for a couple of days, which made me feel the physiological differences. How I was able to breathe easily and how I could sing again. 
  
Now I've told my friends, family and boyfriend about it and no one seems to care. 
I used to smoke a pack a day, sometimes more. My boyfriend especially hated it and said after almost every cigarette how disgusting it smelled or how much he wished I would quit. 
When I told him I finally had, he just said "that's great" and talked about something else. 
  
  
I realize people might be wary of talking about it too much in case it makes me think about having a cigarette again, but I'd just wish people could be more supportive and happy for me in my decision (which is really hard right now). I'm open about the fact that I'm struggling and every minute is an active choice not to have one, but I feel like I'm talking in to thin air. 
  
I really just need to vent and hear I'll make it.

[RANT] Tomorrow is my 31st birthday. The next day is when I start my life free from nicotine!

Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my story. Tomorrow I turn 31. Tomorrow marks 11 years spent with a cigarette in my mouth. 6 months ago I decided to hit the reset button on my life. I ended a decade-long relationship, moved into a new place, started dating and started getting help for my anxiety and depression. A lot has changed in 6 months. I've  met an amazing new woman who has helped me grow up, and continues to help me be the man I want to be. I promised her the day after my birthday, I was going to quit. I'm not quitting just for her, though. I'm quitting because I'm sick of not having control of my life. I'm quitting because I want to have money to go on trips and take her out on amazing dates. I'm quitting because if she and I decide we're in this for the long run, I want to be around and healthy for her and her angelic 4-year-old daughter. Even if she and I don't work out, I want to be around for all of the joy, despair, excitement, monotony, adventure and mundanity life has to offer. I'm ready to grab life by the balls and make it mine. Cigarettes are only going to take away my power to do so. In short, I'm quitting because my life belongs to me, not RJ Reynolds! This weekend....I celebrate...MY INDEPENDENCE! Any and all tips, encouragement, etc., are welcome and appreciated!

Day 5: the first time in ten years that I went for a run and muscle fatigue stopped me before chest pain did. Also, THE SMELLS.

I have stayed in pretty good shape despite smoking between half a pack and a whole pack a day for the last 10 years. Still, it was time. I was tired of feeling like shit, so I quit on Monday and have been using the patch. 

Today, on my first run since I quit, the first thing I noticed was that I could actually *smell* the dirt under my feet. Then I noticed the grass, that dog 50 yards away from me, the ice cream shop up the hill, that lady's perfume... I felt like I could even smell the sunshine! Before I knew it, I had been running for 20 minutes without stopping, whereas before I had been doing this halting, run-walk, coughing-fit-every-few-minutes, total suffer-fest. 

I AM A HAPPY GIRL TODAY, Y'ALL.

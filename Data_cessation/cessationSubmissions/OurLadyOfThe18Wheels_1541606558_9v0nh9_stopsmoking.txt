The depression is the worst.

I tried to quit last year and was doing well until I lost my home to mold and all the stress that went with that. I relapsed and waited until things calmed down to try again.  Since then I keep suffering from horrible depression and the only thing that seems to make it go away is to start smoking again, it's like the lesser of two evils. 

I've seen people on here talk about depression being a side effect of stopping smoking. How do you deal with it and how long does it last? Currently it's my biggest hurdle to overcome.

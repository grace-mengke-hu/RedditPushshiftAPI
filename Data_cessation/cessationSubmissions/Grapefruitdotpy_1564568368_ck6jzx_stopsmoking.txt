Question to ex nicotine patch users

So I am at day 5 with the help of nicotine patches. I want to use the patches for 9-10 weeks, because they really ease my withdrawal symptoms and allow me to live a normal life. 
So my question is how you felt when you stopped using the patches after months? Did you still have withdrawal symptoms?

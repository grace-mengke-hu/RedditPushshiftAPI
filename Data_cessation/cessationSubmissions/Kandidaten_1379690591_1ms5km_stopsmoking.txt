10 days smoke-free. Problems with my mood, cravings and co-workers.

So I have managed 10 days without smoking. Having that extra money on my account feels great and my sense of smell and taste are close to restored.

I do have problems with my mood though. One day I can be jolly happy and bouncing around everywhere until the next day hits where I will be sad and annoyed.

My co-workers ain't really helping either. They know I quit smoking, yet they keep asking if I want one. I was so close to say yes because I felt so miserable but I didn't.

Thank you for reading. Venting here feels great.

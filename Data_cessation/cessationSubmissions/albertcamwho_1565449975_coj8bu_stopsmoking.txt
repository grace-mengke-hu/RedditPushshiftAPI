Day Sixxxxx

Reporting after my last post 17 hours ago, Satan himself was clawing his way out of my dopamine receptors and into my subconscious (I'm not even religious but that's how bad the withdrawals got) going smoke baby, smoke smoke smoke and I said "no asshole I'm not going out drinking on a Saturday evening for a reason" and even though he tried to do his tobacco nitty gritty on my sober titties he failed and I am approaching the 144 hour mark as of now.

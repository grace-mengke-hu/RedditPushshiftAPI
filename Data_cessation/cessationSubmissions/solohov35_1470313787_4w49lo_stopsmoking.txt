Trying to quit for almost 9 months

I decided to quit smoking 9 or 10 months ago after watching the documantary made by allen carr I think. I didnt smoke for 3 or 4 days then I smoked 1 I think I dont really remember then started not carrying cigarettes with me but borrowing 1 or 2 from my friends. I kept that up for I dont know how long sometimes I bought packages myself. I used to smoke 1 pack a day I smoked 1 pack once or twice since 9 or 10 months but I couldnt stop really smoking. I borrowed so many cigarettes  from people  they started to act out so I paid for their coffees if we are sitting at a cafe house  etc.  I decided to never smoke once more todat around 2:00 oclock . I live with my parents they think I quit for good 4 5 months ago so I dont even want cigarettes when I am in the house but as soons as I go out I want to buy a pack and most of my friends smoke so I cant hold myself but smoke 1 cigarette and all you know I end up smoking more than one. I will go out now and I am afraid I am going to smoke again and I am more afraid I will go back smoking 1 pack a day. I also cant say people I quit smoking because they wont believe me. Do you have any suggestions I dont know did any of you going through something like this?

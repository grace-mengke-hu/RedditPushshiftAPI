Trying this out

Been smoking 14 years. Pack a day smoker, sometimes more. Coming here for some support. I'm two years clean from opiates and cocaine (crack also) so I know I can do this. Heading into work now for a long stressful day. At 8 hours now without a cig but that includes me sleeping. I can do this. Let's go!

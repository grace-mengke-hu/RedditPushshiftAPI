Day 3 after so many failed attemps

I'm 54 and have smoked for over 35 yrs and have been quitting every month for the past 3 yrs. I just stumbled onto this page somehow and thought to myself "wow this is exactly what I was looking for and need" I get strength from the post and have been reading these non-stop since I found it. It reminds me of the fellowship and strength I find in AA. Thank you to all who post and share your experience, strength & hope here.

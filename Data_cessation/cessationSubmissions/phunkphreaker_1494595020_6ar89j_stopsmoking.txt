One year! Wooooooooo!

After many YEARS of attempts, I can finally say I DGAF about cigarettes anymore even slightly. It has been somewhat over one year as of today. 

Never going back neva eva eva evaevaevaEVA going back. Just wanted to share!

Couldn't have done it without the support and things I learned here. Alan Carr's books and video were the most helpful for me, for those just starting. That was really the game changer. 

You can do it! Start now. Never give up trying. 

See you wonderful people NEVER again. ;)

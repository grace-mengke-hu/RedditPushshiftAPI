I'm tired of people on here saying 'Just read Carr's book!' 'Just try this hypnosis app!' 'Just take Chantix/Wellbutrin!' 'Just vape!...'

...'Just do the patch, gum, hypnosis, acupuncture, cut back, et cetera et cetera and on and on...

Here's what I know today: It doesn't matter what crutch I try to force myself into to try to force myself into quitting.  I can make it about 5 hours and then I fold. I can't tell you how many nearly full packs I've thrown out or torn to shreds in past 3 months only to speed to store to buy another pack and repeat the insanity.
I've tried EVERY stop smoking trick available. ALL of them, so don't try to suggest one more or I'll scream.
I was able to quit recently from September until the end of December because I WAS READY. I had a meltdown on New Year's and bought a pack because I didn't want to drink again and my brain told me it was one or the other. (5 years sober.) 
AA people will lose their shit when I say this, but in MY EXPERIENCE, this is all willpower. When hour 5 rolls around and my brain starts the dialogue 'You're so bored and aimless- a smoke will help, you can quit tomorrow...' I fold. 
The feeling of being smoke free was great for so many reasons & the feeling of being a smoker again only feels good for the .1 second of first drag and then it's all regret and self-loathing. 
What's my point? 
(As I light another cigarette)... I guess I just want someone to say the one perfect thing that will trip my willpower back into gear... maybe there's someone out there like me (long time lurker) who's fed up with hearing stupid suggestions.
I know: take a walk, drink water, take a nap...
If I weren't me right now I'd tell me to shut the hell up and just quit.

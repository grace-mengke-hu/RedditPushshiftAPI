It's been 1 year since my last cigarette

I smoked everyday for about 4 years prior. Woke up one day and just didn't want it anymore. The thought of another one made me sick. So far I've stuck to my guns and haven't touched one. It's been a challenge tho since my mother smokes, but I'm at the point where it doesn't bother me.

To everyone else out there who is struggling, Hang in there guys, you can do it! It's really mind over matter.

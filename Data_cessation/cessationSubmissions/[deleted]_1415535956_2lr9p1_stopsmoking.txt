One Week

I've been smoke free for a week now (thanks to Allen Carr's book), and I know for sure I'm not going to smoke ever in my life. I've wanted to quit as soon as I realized I was a smoker (this was 7 years ago), but didn't really try seriously, or gave up early because like many people, I thought it was hard to quit, that I wasn't strong enough and thought I had to sacrifice something that helped me. Once these illusions are gone, the reasons to smoke are gone as well.

So fellow quitters, stay strong and get that "HELL NO I'm not smoking that cigarette" attitude, be happy to finally be free of this poison and you'll make it ! Good luck !

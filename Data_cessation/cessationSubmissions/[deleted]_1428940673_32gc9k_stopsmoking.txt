Ex-smokers, has your skin condition improved?

I have recently quit (9 days without smoking), and I noticed on my StopSmoking app that I'm 40% of the way to normal skin hydration. I've always had dry skin and even eczema and wanted to know if quitting has helped remedy any of your skin conditions. Thanks in advance!

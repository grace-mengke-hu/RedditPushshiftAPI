One day at a time

Don't think of not smoking for the rest of your life..  Think of it as one day at a time.  In the morning do a self mediation and tell yourself JUST FOR TODAY I will not smoke... And do it all over again the extra morning.   Etc etc.  Sometimes it's 1 hour at a time or 1 minute at a time.  Don't forget- mind over matter

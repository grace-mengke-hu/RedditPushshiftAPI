Day 15. Worst craving yet.

Hello fellow redditors! Long time lurker here.

I started smoking when about 14 years ago when I was 15. Now I have been without cigarettes for 15 days. 

I Just wanted to say thank you to all of you. I have tried stopping few time before but this is the first time I have been withouth ANY cigarettes for more than 2 week. I think this is because of you guys. I have checked this subreddit almost everyday and it has helped a lot.

Today I had really bad craving. I have been stressed for few months because of work and money. I was just going to buy some cigarettes but reading this subreddit gave strenght to manage this craving. 

Thank you once again.

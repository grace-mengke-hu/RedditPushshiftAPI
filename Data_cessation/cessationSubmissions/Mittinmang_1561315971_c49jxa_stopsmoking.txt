How do you deal with relapse?

I've just started to quit and I've achieved my first 24 hours!

Ive tried quitting before. June 2018. I relapsed, I tried again. 3 times within a short amount of time and that resulted in me giving up. It took one whole year to try again. Now I'm afraid. What IF I relapse? Will I stop trying again?

How did you all deal with relapsing?

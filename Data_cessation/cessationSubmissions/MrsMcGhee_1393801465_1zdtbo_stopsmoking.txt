Ashtray Kisses

Today is day twelve without smoking a cigarette! I feel great and I've only cried 3 times!

My husband still smokes, but he's been cutting back. Now, I love this man to bits. I really do. But, holy guacamole do his kisses taste awful. Is that what my mouth was like when I was smoking? Yuck!

I had one non-smoking friend that would push me away whenever I would try to hug her. She would cover her mouth and nose every time I would come inside from a cigarette. The whole time I though she was just being a bitch. She was. She was being a big ol' bitch. I did stink, though.

I'm glad that I smell better. I hope that Mr. McGhee will quit sometime soon so that we can both smell delicious together!

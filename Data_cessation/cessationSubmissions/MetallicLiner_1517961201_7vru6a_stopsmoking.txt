Update: Nicorette Journey

I’ve posted on here before about my serious nicotine addiction. The addiction goes back 20+ years. I seriously considered myself the most nicotine dependent individual alive... it was that bad. 

I started as a smoker in my teens. Smoking about a pack a day until age 31. That’s when ecigs came out. I got on the ecig train (blu) and supplemented with nicorette gum.

I ditched the stick and went all gum. Nicorette. I’ve been chewing it nonstop for the past six years now. I was more addicted to Nicorette than I ever was w cigs or dip. In some ways it became the new dip for me. I chewed about 10 pieces of 4mg fruit chill a day, sometimes more. And ironic enough I’ve probably spent more $ on Nicorette the past six years than I ever did w cigarettes, for over 20 years. Nicorette rips a hole in your wallet. 

I finally said enough is enough this past week. I was at target and got some generic nicotine patches. I also bought some trident to replace the Nicorette.

I am on the step one patches which are 21 mg. I chewed over 10 pieces of 4mg gum a day which adds us to 40mg, so I had my doubts that only 21 mg would satisfy. On day five now. So far so good. I haven’t been able to even tell a difference. 

I plan to stick w the program and decrease nicotine levels over time. 

Thanks to everyone here for your advice and support. I’m ready to leave nicotine in the dust. It’s a helluva drug.

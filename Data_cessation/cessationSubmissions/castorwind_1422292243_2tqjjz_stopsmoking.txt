Day 1 starts again

I tried quitting so many times and failed many times. Trying again now. This time I will keep a count of hours I didn't smoke rather than days. I just had my last and there is no turning back. Wish me luck and pray for me. Thanks. I will post my progress here. 

Edit: 8:48 mins so far... Taking it hour by hour

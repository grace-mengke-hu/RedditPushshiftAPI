I threw a burning cigarette at someone who tried to get me to smoke again while I was drunk.

Luckily no one got hurt. I had quite a few drinks, and he was nagging me to take a cigarette and blowing smoke my way. So finally I got pissed off and said, ok light me a cigarette. Soon as he handed it to me, I threw it at his face. I'm not proud of my actions, but I am still smoke free and on day number 9. Why do so many people act this way? What is the fun in trying to break someone's will?

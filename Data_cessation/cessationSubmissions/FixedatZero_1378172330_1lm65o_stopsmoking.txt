It's been 15 hours, I'm craving a smoke like mad but I feel like this is it. I'm really going to give it up this time!

Third time lucky I guess. I ran out of smokes yesterday and instead of buying more with my last $20 (in Australia smokes are very expensive), I just bought food which i needed more than something that'll kill me.

I don't get paid for another week, I can't and won't be able to get my hands on any more smokes until then... but by then it'll have been a week and if I can go a week without a smoke then I can go the rest of my life!

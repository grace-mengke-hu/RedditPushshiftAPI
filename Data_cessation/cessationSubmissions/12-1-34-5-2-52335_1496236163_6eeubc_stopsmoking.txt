Just downloaded smoke free app. 50th time trying to quit.

Smoking (and drinking) is my guilty pleasure. I feel like I am stuck in a rut where my entire life is based around cigarettes and beer. I've tried to quit smoking dozens of times and I feel like the only way it will happen is if i quit smoking and drinking both at the same time. 

Beer seems to trigger my inhibitions to smoke and lately money has been tight, and from looking through my past spending, the majority of my paycheck goes to these two disgusting habits. I've begun to grow a beer belly and wake up to coughing fits at night and early in the morning. I am looking for an alternate lifestyle.

My routine has been :

1. Wake Up and go to work

2. Stop for beer and smokes on my way home. (approx. $25 usd)

3. Play video games and drink about 6-10 beers.

4. Repeat.

On weekends I'll wake up in the morning, have my coffee and once I'm done with that I'll smoke a cig and have a beer at 9:30am. I am at my breaking point. I still function as a member of society but lately my health seems to be deteriorating at an alarming rate. 

If anyone has any advice on how to swing my life around please don't be afraid to speak up. My one other hobby is dirtbiking but even then I always bring beer and cigarettes with me. I don't know how to kick the habits out of my life while also keeping my hobbies(video games, dirtbike) without always associating the two.

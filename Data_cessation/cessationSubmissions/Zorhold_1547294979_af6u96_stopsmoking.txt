Day 5 now - First real test passed

Hey guys, daily post for reflection and maybe advice!

I'm on day 5 now (118 hours) and passed my first major test yesterday! I went to a party, had 2 beers (I didn't want to drink at first, because I was scared of relapsing, but my friends assured me, they'd have an eye on me) and didn't smoke, although several of my friends did! Of course the cravings came, but I was able to stay strong by myself!

Today is my first day back at work, so that's the next test. Chewing gum and toothpicks are plenty, so I'm confident. To my quit date bros and sis and everybody else: Let's not smoke together! Stay strong, we can do this!

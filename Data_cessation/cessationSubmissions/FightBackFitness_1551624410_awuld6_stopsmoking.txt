Feeling great! Already noticing considerable improvements. Better mood, decreased stress and anxiety levels. More interested now in things I used to do. Iâ€™ve started gaming again which is a welcome distraction. In general I have an overall desire to get fit and healthy. I have cut my smoking in half with nicotine chewing gum and have made a promise to be fully off cigarettes when I hit my one month! But one day at a time. Keep on keepin on my friends, your all amazing!

I quit smoking almost 5 years ago but got drunk last night and smoked 3 cigarettes.

I guess I'm because I feel terrible about it. It took me so long to quit. I tried so many times but whenever I would break my quitting streak in the last that would always make me lose motivation and completely start again. How can I make myself realize the 5 yrs is still valid and important?

Smoke or no smoke.....

With or without a cigarette.....

Wives or girlfriends or husbands or boyfriends will continue to fight with you

Children will continue to raise hell

Boss will continue to screw you

Juniors and subordinates will continue to irritate you

Colleagues will continue to try tripping you over

And the moron at the end of the street will continue to be a moron......

Amidst such hostilities, the best that you can do to yourself is not to smoke.......While others are so keen to make life difficult for you, why add to it yourself by smoking? 

Add to it, the incentive of making people jealous because you could quit and they couldn't......

Awareness of appreciation (day 14)

I've gone out to play basketball today. I was a bit moody and my blood flow was somewhat fucked. 

Just running alone with a ball and breathing a lot makes you more aware of your lungs, breath, heart, body...

You become more aware of the good things that come with not smoking even though you may still find yourself a bit irritable and speculative.. 

With this appreciation of your body that comes with physical activity your mood increases, blood flow (makes you think better too), it really makes the idea of smoking way way less invasive than usually.      What other things have helped you?

Gave in on day 3

I've been trying to quit for many years. I did quit in 2012 after smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 5 years. I did it cold turkey but I never got a full year of no cigarettes in. Every once in a while I would smoke a pack. In April 2017 I started smoking regularly again and reached 20 a day again.
Read Alan Carr's book with a good dose of skepticism. But it did work. Smoked the last cigarette before bed and woke up next day without any urge to smoke. Refused a free cigarette and went to the grocery shop and didn't buy a pack. Day 2 started off well too but in the evening my brain started rationalising.
I didn't need to smoke but I wanted to smoke. I know it does nothing for me and only does harm. I know every cigarette causes the empty feeling instead of getting rid of it. But I still wanted to smoke. I felt like why shouldn't I have a vice. If I could smoke 2 cigarettes a day I'd like that. Despite the continued misery it would cause me.
So today in the morning bought a pack and smoked one. Don't feel too bad about doing it either.
Anyone else feels the same way? Any advice for me? Scold me if you'd like.

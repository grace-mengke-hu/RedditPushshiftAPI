The One-Month Itch... *Gulp*

I'm about a month in and I feel very pleased with myself. However I know that the first month is the easiest, for me at least. I'm buoyed by the novelty of not smoking and the speed at which life seems to improve. The memories of how much I hated smoking are still fresh in my mind. 

But at this stage, it's always tempting to have a big hedonistic blow out  night where I get wasted and buy a packet of cigs. I tell myself it's so easy and enjoyable to stop smoking that I can start again for a bit and I'll just stop again. Deep down I know it'll take me months or even years to find the motivation to quit again and I should just never touch another one. 

But Jesus it's tempting. These next two months will be the most difficult. 

How does everyone else feel about the one-month mark?

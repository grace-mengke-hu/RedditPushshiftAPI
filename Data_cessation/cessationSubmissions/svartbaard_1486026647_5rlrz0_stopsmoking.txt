How to deal with the total lack of concentration.

I just started again after a bit of a relapse (should reset my badge), but I would really appreciate advice on how to not totally lose focus! Normal cravings are okay but the feeling of not being able to concentrate on anything drives me up the wall every time I try to quit. This in turn causes my mind to freak out. It sort of feels like there is a fire which I need to put out, no rational thoughts and reasoning apply.

Then I usually just light a cigarette to keep my mind from totally spinning out of control...which leads to relapse every time.

Thank you very much. I really need to beat this disgusting addiction.

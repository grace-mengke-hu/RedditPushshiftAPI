23 days in - I feel free.

I got my tonsils out on April 28th. I stopped smoking two days before that per the request of my doctor. I figured this was THE time to actually quit. I've tried many times in the past and always failed. I'd get in my car and need to smoke while driving. Going on a walk with a cigarette or two. Joining my SO out on our deck for a morning cigarette with our coffee. Going out to the bars.

Well now I've done all those things without actually having a cigarette. Without actually NEEDING a cigarette.

It feels so good to know that I can actually quit. That I can save $100 or more a month and put that extra money towards my student loan debt. 

Last year I quit drinking. Now I've quit smoking. I feel so much healthier and positive about myself. Hoping to keep coming back here for more support and to support everyone else.

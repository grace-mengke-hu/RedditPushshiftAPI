Quit Smoking while doing NoFap and I'm one month smoke-free.

One month ago today I quit smoking and a few of my friends have become more conscious of their smoking habits, while one of my friends is now currently on day four! It feels good that I've helped encourage them to try and I've been as encouraging and supportive as I can be, for my friends and for myself.

Also, I think what actually helped me quit so easy was NoFap. Not the approriate forum, I get that, but I am on day 20 of that and my life is changed so much in that time. I was never addicted to PMO or anything, but I had a history with it and I decided to give it a try. Months and months of relapsing, until one special day I stopped smoking and for actually quite a few reasons, I tried NoFap at the same time. Now I'm healthier and feel like a better, more constructive and creative person with newfound ambition and all this other stuff. I still have bad days, but I can turn it around much easier when I remember that I've quit smoking. I encourage everyone here to keep on keepin' on with their quit and that if they truly want the change, anything can happen. Thank you!

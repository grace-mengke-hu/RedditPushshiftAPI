84 hours down, still feeling good.

Now it hasn't been super easy but I don't feel like shit like I thought I would. I haven't noticed a difference in taste but damn I can smell everything! I can smell every smoker. Even just a faint smell of cigs I can smell. It's a whole new world to my nose.

I haven't really coughed up anything but I smoked for 20 years so I guess that will come later. I have a lot of
 energy and my mood has been pretty positive.

How are you guys doing out there?

Update: 97 hours down and drunk: still nicotine free!!

How it feels to be 15 days smoke free.

It feels normal now but I wanted to share what I've really noticed since I've stopped smoking.

They're so dam expensive. I've already saved a lot of money.

I wake up and I'm less afraid... less fear and panic. I don't have that panic about having to smoke my first smoke of the day. It's great to get rid of that fearfulness.

My lungs. They have really opened and worked better, I'm sure this gets even better too :-) when I was a smoker I had a sore chest and heart. And I still smoked.. Pure addition. Feeling my lungs and heart return to normal is fantastic.

My legs have better bloodflow. Less tired after exercise. Less moody. Smell really good, used to hate feeling dirty and smelling so much. Eye sight is better, food tastes incredible. I'm much happier.. No longer being a slave to nicotine.

Just wanted to share this info to help anyone out there. If i could, I'd share this with past me! I tried stopping smoking many times and read the Allen Carr book which helped.. Ultimately it's really your decision and you can totally do it if you make that decision certain and final.

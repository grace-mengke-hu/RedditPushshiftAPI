Hey guys I'm a little conflicted.

So I've gone over 5 weeks without a cigarette and I've been pretty proud of myself. Well I was talking to a friend and telling them about my achievement when I brought up the fact that I occasionally smoke marijuana. He pretty much told me that whatever streak I'm on should be restarted since I'm still inhaling a different form of smoke. That's been in my head all weekend and it's making me feel guilty. What do you guys think? Should I reset to the last time I actually smoked anything period or let it be and focus on avoiding cigarettes.

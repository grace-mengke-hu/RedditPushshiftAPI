13 days... Easy during the holiday, but now i'll be heading home

So I (F25) quitted smoking 13 days ago. It's not my first try and I already knew, the best way to quit is when i am somewhere else, somewhere i'm not used to smoke. I thought it would be a good idea to quit in my holidays in spain and it worked. "Fortunately", i got ill the first week, so i didn't really have  cravings. I am 25 and started smoking when i was 14 and i smoked a lot. I smoked at least a pack a day and  a lot more when i drank some beer or went partying. In a few days I'll be heading back to Germany and i know on wednesday i'm going to visit a party of my university. I am some kind of nervous, because i know the last time i tried to quit i just gave up during the evenig... I really need to stop smoking. I'm also living with roommates and 2 of them smoke. It will be the first time after almost 2 weeks that im going to smell it again. What are you guys doing, when you go out with friends or spend the time with people who smoke?

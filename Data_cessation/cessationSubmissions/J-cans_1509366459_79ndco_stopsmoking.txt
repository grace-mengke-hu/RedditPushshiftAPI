My two year story

I was sitting ok my couch on October 21 2017. It was not late but dark none the less. I was watching a movie with my girlfriend when out of no where, my phone chimed...... 
"who the f@&amp;k could this be" I thought to myself as I reached for the device. "Who is that? She asked........
It was 10:30pm and it was my smoke free app alerting me to the fact that I had just crossed the two years quit mark. 

I cannot describe the feeling of getting that alert. I had stopped counting, stopped waiting for that next level of achievement. 

It has been two years. I started smoking at 15 years old and continued for the next 20 years. I had so many chances to quit in those twenty years. It feels so good to now have two years not smoking under my belt. 

This post isn't to pat myself on the back though, it's to provide something to look forward to. Quitting is tough in the beginning but as living proof, you can do it. 

Thanks to the developers who made smoke free and thanks for the support of the Reddit community, I'm looking forward to the next 20 years of not smoking!

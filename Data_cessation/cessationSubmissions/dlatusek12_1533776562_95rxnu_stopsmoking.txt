4 Days Cigarette Free 🤟🏼

It hasn’t been easy but I’ve come this far and more motivated than ever to never touch one again. My girlfriend and I quit since we came down to Key West for vacation and I’ll admit we’re sucking on plenty of lozenges and smoking a JUUL but we’re already beginning to slow down on them! Love this life.

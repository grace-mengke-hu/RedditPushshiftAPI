Anyone get dizzy?

Anyone get dizzy when fighting a crave?
I've been struggling a bit this morning, as I get into my Monday morning work routine and pound back the coffee.  I found the coffee to be triggering me, so I dumped it out and switched to some fancy tea, and now I'm feeling kinda dizzy... not sure if it's the tea or the crave....

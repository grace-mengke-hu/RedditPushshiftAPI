Mind=Blown.

So I wanted to share my experience and hope this makes a difference to some of you fellow smokers. I have been a pretty ongoing smoker since about 17 and have been getting some pretty harsh feedback from hubby and friends about stopping, obviously. Listen- it's not that easy. I took a good break for about three years while I was pregnant and my son was little but lo-and-behold, hanging around it leads to temptation, and leads to the drag. Needless to say I was back on for about 7 years, and tried just about every solution everyone else has looking through this thread. We were visiting family in Aurora, IL last Christmas and I stumbled upon some girl behind a table with samples of "nicotine pouches". If you haven't heard about them, they are really life changing, I have managed to be now going on 11 months smoke free. I recommend starting with the pouches when you're driving around or traveling and can't get a smoke break, then eventually it led to me completely stopping. I have tried both Zyn and On!, but my preference is with on! pouches as they are a lot smaller and seem to last longer. It's a new concept for us here but I did my research and the product is made in Sweden which has the lowest smoker rate in the world so they must be doing something right! 

Kudos to the guys at on! nicotine, my family and I are eternally grateful for your product, and for the rest of you that are looking for a solution, I really recommend giving them a try.

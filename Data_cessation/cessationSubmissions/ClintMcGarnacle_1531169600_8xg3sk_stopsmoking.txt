Panic and depression since I've quit smoking

I quit cigarettes on Valentine's Day and quit nicotine altogether about two weeks ago.  I hadn't had a panic attack since I started smoking but I've had several since I quit tobacco.  This leads me to believe maybe the MAOIs in cigarettes held the panic attacks in check.  Has anyone else had a similar experience and if so what has helped?  I've been exercising and I cut back on alcohol but that has only helped so much.  I don't want to go back to smoking but my quality of life has gone downhill.

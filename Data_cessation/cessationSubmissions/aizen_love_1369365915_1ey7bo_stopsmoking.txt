Day 5 and questioning.

It may just be the withdrawals still going, but I really am dealing with a lot of shit right now. My best friend committed suicide in December (I haven't really dealt with it.), I flunked out of school trying to deal with the suicide. I've known cigarettes for so long that I don't know if I can handle this shit without them.

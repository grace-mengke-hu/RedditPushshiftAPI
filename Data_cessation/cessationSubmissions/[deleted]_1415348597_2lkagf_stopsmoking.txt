After almost 174 "day ones", according to fiance, I am now day 4.

Not really a heavy smoker, at my "height" it was maybe a pack a day, and over the last 175 I've gone from that to like 3 to 6 a day. But I struggled, and continue to struggle with it. I feel like I can't sleep the last few nights. I keep struggling on because I know I need to, I need to quit smoking, quit drinking, and quit all these vices taking me away from life and the world. How many more "day ones" am I going to go through? Any advice at all to help me regain sleep?

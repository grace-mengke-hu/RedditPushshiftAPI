Second thoughts and concerns I am having

I have never been on this subreddit so I am truly sorry if this is not entirely relevant

I had my last cigarette on November 21st and switched over to an e-cig with 18mg of nicotine. The reason I quit is because my girlfriend of over two years had been increasingly given me a hard time for my12 cigarette a day habit. The first week was easy but the past week has been incredibly difficult. If I'm around someone smoking its incredibly tempting but I have so far avoided it.

However the problem is that we have been having problems with our sex life for the past three months and me quitting has just increased my frustrations. So the problem is that part of me now wants to smoke again out of spite and resentment and I am wondering if you guys had any suggestions over how to get over these feelings

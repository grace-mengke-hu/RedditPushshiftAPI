9 days in and I had to get my daughters dog put down

I have been doing really good up to now but today I really hated the fact that I had quit smoking right now. My daughter and I had 2 dachshunds, half brothers, that we both love and today we had to get her lovely guy, Samwise, put down. He had developed a tumor and was in pain and there was no question that it was the right decision to take the pain away and let him die in peace. It was all I could do to not go and buy cigarettes. It was only through really talking to myself and realizing that smoking was not going to make this any easier or less sad, in fact, all it would do was make me feel like shit for smoking. I really loved my Samwise and will miss him terribly but am glad that going back to smoking is not his legacy to me

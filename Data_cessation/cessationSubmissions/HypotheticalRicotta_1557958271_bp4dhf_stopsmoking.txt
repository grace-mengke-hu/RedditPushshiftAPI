How many of you have quit drinking?

I'm 8 days in, haven't drunk in 9 days, until today. And I've only had a single beer. That's all the excuse that I needed to accept a cigarette when offered. I feel terrible because I didn't even feel like I needed it this time. I'm just so accustomed to using alcohol as an excuse to indulge in the filthy habit.

I'm cutting myself off now; I don't think I can currently enjoy alcohol without smoking, but I feel like this is a bit of a wake-up call in terms of my excuse making. my mouth feels so filthy after that one cigarette, and one of my immediate reasons for quitting is that I'm going to need my wisdom teeth removed (unrelated to smoking).

I'm curious to here what you all think of drinking. Is the association an actual thing? I obvious don't trust myself with any sort of excessive drinking but a beer to two doesn't seem to be a problem, and historically I could hold out longer than a single drink before reaching for a pack.

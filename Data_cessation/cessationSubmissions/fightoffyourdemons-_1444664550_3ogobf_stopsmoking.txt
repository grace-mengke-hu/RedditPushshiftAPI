Alternatives to smoking for study breaks?

I quit smoking about six weeks ago but now the semester is underway again and I need an alternative. 

I caved and bought a pack of cigs today and going from the sixth floor of the library, down to outside for a cig is the perfect 10 minute break from studying.

When I'm back to quitting smoking how do I get out of this habit and form a new, better one?

I'm also trying to lose weight so want to avoid end up in the cafe downstairs snacking when I need a break

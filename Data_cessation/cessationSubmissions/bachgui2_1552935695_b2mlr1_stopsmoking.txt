Failed the first day, after 18 hours, now I fucking hate myself

Me and my wife tried to stop today, she failed in the morning, i went through all day without too many problems and then out of nowhere i started to feel weird, started dissociating, i was in fear of having an anxiety attack, and i bought a pack of cigs.

I hate this addiction

I hate myself for not passing just one fucking day without cigs. I'm feeling like a piece of trash right now...

I idolize smoking, and view it as 'cool' - This continues to prevent me to quit. What do I do?

As the title says.

This is probably one of the more uncommon reasons as for somebody to quit smoking, as it tends to be a phase that a lot of people get over within a short while of beginning, but I just can't stop seeing it as utterly badass.

It doesn't help that I watch plenty of 80s action movies, and everybody's just got a fucking death stick hanging out of their mouth at all times, and I just can't help but see it as cool. The glamorization of tobacco within the film industry is still prevalent today, however and I'm unfortunately the biggest sucker for it.

When I was a child, what really sparked my interest in smoking was the [Knox dance scene from Charlie's Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oyP0QHjty8) - This is really what kicked it off for me, and made me interested in smoking as a kid. 

What's even worse is that whilst I'm comfortable with switching to vaping, I can't at all find it anywhere near as fun as puffing on rolled tobacco. I just see vaping as a necessity, and relatively un-enjoyable. 

Am I doomed to smoke forever like my mother? I'm sick right now, for the third time this month. I'm only 22, I only started smoking six months ago, and my body (especially tonsils) aren't too happy about the change, needless to say.

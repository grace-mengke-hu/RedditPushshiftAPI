Day 3 nicotine free

I quit smoking about 2 weeks ago. But 3 days ago I cut out the aids (gum and vape).

It's been pretty rough. Been anxious, my chest hurts, I have brain fog out the ass, lungs feel heavy, tired a lot.

But through all that. I'm starting to feel normal in a sense. I can smell and taste better. First thing I noticed was how awful my breath was from all the smoking. I can smell the weather again if that makes sense.

It's totally worth it. And I can't wait to tell you guys when I make it even further!

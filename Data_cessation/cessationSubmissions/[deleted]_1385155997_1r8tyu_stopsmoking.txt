First post! need some help to make sure this pack STAYS in the garbage

Hello all,
Firstly, I think you all are wonderful.
I quit smoking after 7 years (I'm 23) on 11/12/13.  After a particularly annoying day at work and a demonic 30 minute craving I bought a pack of Marlboro red 72s, my ex toxic best friend.  It certainly didn't taste like it used to (bc I couldn't even taste them at all) but it felt good.  Now I'm home, I smoked half of another one, and threw the pack in the trash.  My first plan was to quit again on Tuesday morning after my night shift.  I've decided that this is a stupid plan and I shouldn't touch another one.  I'm sitting here with a beer and a kitty, terrified I'm going to be digging through the trash tonight.  
r/stopsmoking, do you have any advice?   I've been trying to fake it till I make it after reading most of Allen Carr's book (being enthusiastic trying to make my self agree that being a nonsmoker is the best me I can be, that I've been tricked into being a happy nicotine addict).  I've been feeling successful until my drive home. Ugh.

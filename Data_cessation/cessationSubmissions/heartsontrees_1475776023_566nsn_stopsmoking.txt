New to this subreddit, trying to quit. Any advice welcome!

Hey everyone, I'm a 31 year old female who started smoking about a year and a half ago when my ex boyfriend got me into it. I've tried to quit cold turkey a couple times but ended up going right back to the cigs. My life is super stressful lately which is a trigger for me because I use smoking as a stress reliever. I also smoke when I drink. 

I want to quit for health reasons and for myself first and foremost, but also I have a 4 year old daughter and I don't want her to have to be around this. Also, smoking is getting in the way of my relationship with my boyfriend. He has wanted me to quit for awhile and has stuck by me through the countless times I've tried, but I can tell he's getting frustrated which really just starts a vicious cycle of the stress/smoking. Anyone have any advice on how to quit and to deal with cravings in a different way? 

Thanks everyone!

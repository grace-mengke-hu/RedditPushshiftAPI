Champix help!

I’m day 12 on Champix and although it’s working and I am about to reach my quit day, the side effects are unbearable! Nausea and vomiting unless I take with 3 pieces of bread. Sleeping had also been weird lately, it’s like I am sleeping in one hour periods with strange dreams and not to forget the low mood and motivation. I know without Champix my will power (I have very little lol) is not enough but not sure how much longer I can stand feeling like this. Has anyone done anything different to get done much needed relief?

Nicotine and Pregnancy

I've been lurking here for quite some time and I really appreciate everyone's strength and honesty.

I started smoking when I was 19, am now 31. I've been trying to quit for the past year because I feel like shit all the time. I quit drinking over 3 months ago, which was scary and necessary.

I used to say for 10 years "I'll quit smoking when I'm pregnant."

Well, I had a positive pregnancy test on Friday (planned). And I just keep hearing myself saying that and it's been great. I wish that I could have quit on my own, but this little bundle of cells that will hopefully turn into a person one day is what I needed for it to really click.

Good luck everyone, and I will not smoke with you today!

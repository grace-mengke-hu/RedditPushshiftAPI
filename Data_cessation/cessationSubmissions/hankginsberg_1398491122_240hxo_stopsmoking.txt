3 months and some days in. Feels like I'm back on Week 1

It's been a while since I felt like I was struggling with this. And this subreddit was great for the first few weeks of quitting. So I wonder if anyone can explain the 3 month thing...

For the last three or so days, I've hit the biggest wall in weeks. I wake up craving and the craves come in waves and last for an age. I'm tired again for no reason and I feel agitated but listless. WTF? 

On a positive note, my sense of smell continues to return to the point where New smells wash over me and go "what's that smell?" And gather it's scent up like Grenouille in Suskind's Perfume.

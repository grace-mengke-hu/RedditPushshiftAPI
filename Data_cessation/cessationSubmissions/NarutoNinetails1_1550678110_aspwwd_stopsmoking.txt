3 days without smoking - nervous to go on my nightly strolls because I feel the temptation may be too strong

Hello all, I am new to this subreddit, just found it and it seems like a great community! Thanks for reading my post, any advice and criticism would be greatly appreciated.

A little background - I've only been smoking for 3 months and have gone through about 3 packs a week (20's) stupidly picked the habit up at fucking 23, when i should have had more sense.

I feel like now would be the most opportune time to quit, I honestly never had any intention to quit smoking because I enjoyed it so much, but I realised I should get out before I get in too deep so this recent stretch has been my first attempt. 

My favourite time to smoke would be during my nightly hour stroll through the City Centre just appreciating music, puffing and enjoying the lights and busyness lost in my own world.

I've literally been going on these walks everyday for 3 months and found them super enjoyable and therapeutic, but haven't gone the past three days for fear that it would tempt me to smoke, initially I even thought whats the point of going on these walks anymore as honestly smoking was half the enjoyment, but I still miss them.

I actually still have a 3/4 deck in my room, cant bring myself to throw it away. Never crave it during the evening if home, only if I ever randomely wake up at 3am which for some reason has been happening for a few months.

I mean the common sense solution is to leave wallet and cigs home, but I live in a really friendly town and I've shamelessly scrounged dozens of cigs from people before and I'm worried I would be tempted to do this again. I've even made acquaintances that like to smoke with me whenever we occasionally bump into each other and we always cover for each other with smokes if the other is out

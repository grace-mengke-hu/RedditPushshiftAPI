Had a thought for a tactile quitting aid. Suggestions/Interest?

So, for back story, I have a family member that is trying to quit smoking, so I know how much of it can be the ingrained physical routine.  

Long story short, I accidentally made an aluminum rod that was remarkably close to the dimensions of a 100mm cigarette on the lathe. Despite being a very occasional smoker (like once a year), I found myself holding it and fiddling with it as I would a cigarette.

Like I said, I know that the feeling of "oh god what do I do with my hands now" can be frustrating for people.  Would a nice, polished aluminum or brass (possibly wood also, but later) tube in common cigarette sizes be useful to scratch that itch?

I know that they make dummy cigarettes and stuff, but those LOOK like cigarettes, and the flavored ones seem to reinforce the "PUT ME IN YOUR MOUTH".  I'm more thinking something that you could keep in your pocket or purse, and if you had it out on your desk at work, or at your table in a restaurant, it just looks like a little fidget bar.  I was thinking maybe even cutting little rings toward one side to draw your fingers to the "filter" side. Given the time and stock cost I would say one of these would be about 15 to 20ish bucks shipped.

Anyway, I would love any feedback or suggestions.  Like I said, I know how hard you guys are working for it, and I would love to be able to help.

Thanks!

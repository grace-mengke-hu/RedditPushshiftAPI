Day One Finally Over

Today is my first day of officially quitting. I've been building up to this point for a while - just exhausted of smoking, and everything that smoking brings with it. I've been smoking for 10 years, since I was 17, and I'm ready to stop. 

I've tried using patches and going cold turkey before, but neither of them did the trick. I always found some way to justify having a cigarette. My doctor prescribed me Chantix, and after a week of taking it, cigarettes have finally started to taste like the sh*t they are. I luckily haven't experienced any major symptoms yet, and I hope that this time I'll be able to stick to quitting. 

I set my quit date to today, and had my last cigarette over 24 hours ago. While today was really tough (I had two intense craving episodes and two milder ones), it was doable. I'm taking it one day at a time. I think I'm going to try to avoid alcohol for a while, too, since drinking and smoking is one of my main triggers. I'm excited to work towards a healthier body. 

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone in this community for sharing their stories and their struggles. I've been visiting this subreddit for a few months now, trying to build up the will to quit. Reading the posts, and seeing how many people have been able to successfully quit for years, really helped get me to this point. I wish everyone lots of luck and success in staying clean!

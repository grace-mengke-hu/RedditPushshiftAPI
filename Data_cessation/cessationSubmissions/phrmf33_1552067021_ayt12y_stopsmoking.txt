Crazy cravings

Ill be 4 months smoke free in 6 days, but today I've been having these strong cravings to smoke. I can imagine how awful it would feel if I did it, but I can't shake the cravings off. 

I think I will not smoke, but the feeling of missing something, of missing it, is really stronger than it has ever been. Has anyone been through something similar?

Thanks!

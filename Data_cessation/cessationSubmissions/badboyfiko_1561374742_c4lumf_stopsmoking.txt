One month in and struggling

Today is my 28th day smokefree and I really lost all motivation. I don’t even see a point in quitting anymore. I don’t even wanna be a non-smoker anymore. I feel like I’d rather have all the downsides of smoking than live a life in this constant war with myself and not enjoying it at all. Any last words from you guys before I go and get a pack ? Maybe someone will say something that will give some more strength.

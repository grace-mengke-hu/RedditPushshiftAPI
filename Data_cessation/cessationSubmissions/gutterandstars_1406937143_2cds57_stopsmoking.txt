Had a pub night with friends. Managed to not smoke. Yay!

Just day 14 but I wanted to thank this sub reddit n whoever came up with the idea of the badge...had a night out with pals n I managed to resist the urge , when 4 of my my pals were smoking...     
a question I get asked is how long will I continue this non smoking phase? I honestly don't know and feel that there will come a time in the future when I will light one up, but its not gonna be today.

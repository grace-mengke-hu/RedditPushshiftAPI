Thats it, I'm quitting today!

Hey everyone, today is the day I quit smoking. I'm 22 years old, and have been smoking for 4 years now. I have made a lot of attempts to quit this year, but I relapsed every time. This time however I really want to commit myself to succeed. A friend of mine is stopping as well, and I'm sure that this will make it easier. 

So wish me luck, I'm motivated by all the success stories on this sub :)

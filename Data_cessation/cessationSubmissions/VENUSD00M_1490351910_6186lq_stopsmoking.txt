Quiting after sleep.

Hello 

I am 27 years old male and have been smoking since 17. At first it was only a pack per week for a year and then it started increasing rapidly and drastically. For the last 5 years I have smoked 2 packs per day. While I'm writing this my pack has 7 cigarettes left and I bought it just 7 hours ago. 

My worst deal is coffee. When I'm having a regular huge cup I smoke 3 to 4 cigarettes with it, and I usually have 4 to 5 cups per day. I really love coffee.

On top of that there is this gaming thing. While I play videogames which is 40% of my free time, I usually don't even notice that I just had one..so I light another one.

I tried quiting once in 2015 and I was without a puff for 5 long and horrible days. I couldn't sleep at all..nights felt like nightmare. Days I spent thinking about them and how sad and pathetic I am for not being able to smoke anymore. Those memories of me smoking kept flashing in my head..it gave me a feeling like happy childhood memory would do. I kept thinking "But why do I have to stop, I can end this right now" i had a feeling of being forever sad if I stop smoking. it was miserable. I kept comforting myself that it will be alright " look my grandma is 89 years old and she still smokes,it cant be that bad" So yes I gave in and smoked like a little bitch that I am. 

I have a wife and a 2 year old son who are exposed to my smoking habits.

I need to stop before it is too late.
Starting tomorrow morning I will no longer smoke.

I had to write this somewhere and this sub seemed okay with it.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. 

Sorry for my bad english

I bought a vape cigarette contraption last Wednesday, haven't bought a pack since. Still experiencing mild withdrawals even with the ecigg.

Mostly irritability. I get REALLY irritated without cigarettes, and even with the vape I'm experiencing some mild mood issues. I've smoked for 7 years. Quite heavily for the past 5 or so.  Cigarettes were like Xanax to me, and I LOVED them. 

I know it's killing my lungs, and I need my lungs to be healthy so I can continue to smoke copious amounts of cannabis for the next 5 decades or soo. 

Thus, I can't smoke tobacco any long. The vape has helped tremendously with the cravings, and I can knock myself down to a lower nicotine level at anytime.

I feel like weaning myself off nicotine has already helped tremendously. I haven't went this long without a cigarette since I had my wisdom teeth out. 

Regardless, if any of you are having troubles with constant relapse, I HIGHLY recommend trying vaping. It may still be nicotine, but you can control your intake and you AREN'T getting raped by as many carcinogens while you wean yourself off. Do it, folks!

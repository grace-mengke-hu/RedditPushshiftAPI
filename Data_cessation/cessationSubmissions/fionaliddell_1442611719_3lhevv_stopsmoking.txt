Day 3: Living with smokers is difficult but not impossible.

21 years old, smoked for four years. Beginning a career as a professional singer/musician, I am well aware of the opportunities that smoking could rob me of. Entering my third day of no fags. Finished Allen Carr's book on Tuesday night and have passed it onto my roommates but neither of them show any interest in quitting. So, for now I'm living under constant exposure to cigarettes. However, by applying Carr's method to my situation and by reminding myself to keep a positive attitude towards being a non-smoker, this has by far been my most confident quit. Hope I can continue to enjoy the company of friends (smokers or non) with the frame of mind of an ex smoker/pro musician! Good luck to all those out there beginning their journey. We dinnae need those shite fags! Get out and enjoy life as a healthier, freer person. :)

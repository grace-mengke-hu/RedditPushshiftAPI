6 months! It does get easier.

Today is 6 months cigarette and nicotine free for me after 19 years of smoking. I quit cold turkey. No patch, no gum, no vape, no nothing. 

I don't think I could have made it through the first couple of weeks without /r/stopsmoking and Joel's Whyquit Youtube videos. It's been tough, but I did it, and I absolutely feel better than I ever did when I was smoking. I still have a little bit of post-smoking weight to lose.

These days, I only (mentally) reach for the (non-existent) pack of cigarettes in extremely stressful moments...but even those are decreasing in frequency.

I'm happy and comfortable with my role as a non-smoker. 

For those of you who are considering it, or struggling through those first few days/weeks: It is possible. You can do this!!

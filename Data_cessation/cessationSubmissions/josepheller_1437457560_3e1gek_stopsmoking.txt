All my packs are the "last pack"

I have been telling myself for weeks now that this is the last time. The last pack I'll need to buy before I can quit for good.

I've made all the excuses I know of. My life is too stressful right now. There's a lot of other changes I need to deal with first. I can keep this pack for a while and just have one now and then. It's all crap.

The truth is my life has been pretty heavy lately. I moved across the country. I started a new job in a new city where I know practically no one. My father is chronically ill, probably from the pack he smoked every day, and I'm nowhere near him should the worst happen. To say I've been stressed out is a vast understatement.

But that's all just an excuse. In the grand scheme of things, my life has been going great! This move was a leap of faith, and so far it has paid off with the best job I've ever had. I love the city I live in, even if it gets lonely and I feel lost from time to time. My wonderful, talented, almost too-good-to-be-true girlfriend moves out here in less than two months, and we will have a chance to make a life for ourselves together. I could not be more excited...or more alive.

So I need to stop with the excuses. I want to enjoy this beautiful life I have been granted. I want to get up in the morning and run through the park. I want to go out at night after a summer rain and breathe the cool air. I don't want to keep pretending I need this filthy habit as a crutch to keep me centered and present. And I don't want to wait any longer to get started.

So I will do just that...right after this pack is done.

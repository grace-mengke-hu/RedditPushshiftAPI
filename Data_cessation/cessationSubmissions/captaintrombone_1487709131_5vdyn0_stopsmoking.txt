Day 4 no nicotine

I was a social smoker and a snus user for 5 years.  I have now gone 4 days without nicotine .  I'm 30 in may.  I wanted to be in the best shape for then.  I always get nervous to put on weight.  I cut out alcohol a month ago and now on to this.   I no longer will be a slave to any drugs.

The cravings are coming! Help!

I have been a smoker for 8 years. Watched Allen Carr's stop smoking video on youtube the 17th, and thus i had my first 24 hours with no cigarette in 8 years. I've made it 7 days now.
I've been out drinking, gone out on breaks with my smoker friends, been to a smoke-inside pub while drunk for hours and I've made it through with honestly less effort that I thought it would take.    
I've honestly been really good to keep calm and tell myself I don't need it. Then I would forget right away that I wanted it. I've been able to cast away cravings in SECONDS.

But THIS whole day I've been craving a cigarette and I keep justifying in my head why I deserve it and can handle it and make it "just one cigarette". It's been a constant ongoing battle in my head for 7 hours. I have thought about nothing else but if or not to have that cigarette. Now I feel like I just want to have it so I can move the heck on with my day. 

I almost didn't post this so I could feel better if I end up smoking (not convinced I'm not going to)    
Have any of you guys felt like this? :(

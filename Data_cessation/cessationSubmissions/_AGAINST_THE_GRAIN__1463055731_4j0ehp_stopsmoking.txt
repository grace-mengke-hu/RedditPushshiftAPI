How I quit vaping (E-Cigs)

I'm not sure if this is allowed here, but I thought quitting e-cigs (vaping) was similar enough to quitting smoking.

**I wanted to share a simple trick** I discovered along my journey to end my addiction to nicotine, because it's hard to find a lot of resources or accounts of quitting vaping on the internet (as opposed to quitting smoking). It's not guaranteed to work for everyone, but it most certainly worked for me when nothing else would.

**For this method, you will need:**

* Your regular vape setup
* Your favorite e-liquid (in your usual strength)
* Zero-nicotine e-liquid (preferably similar in taste to your favorite kind)

**What I basically did** was simple; I filled up my tank in the morning (as per usual) with my standard juice. Throughout the day, I *slowly* drip-fed my zero-nic (we'll call it the 'imposter' juice) into my tank, on a pretty consistent basis. If there was even a little room in my tank at the top, I put some zero in. If done correctly, the transition is **so seamless** that you won't even notice what you're missing; the 'imposter' juice will already be adapted to your taste buds (or, at least it was for me).

**Why I believe this worked so well** for me is because the psychological symptoms outweighed the physical ones on an almost 10:1 ratio. Instead of perceiving negative side-effects, I instead felt my **heart beating slower**, my **breathing becoming deeper** and my mind becoming clearer. 

Well, anyway, I hope someone finds some value in this. Thanks for reading!

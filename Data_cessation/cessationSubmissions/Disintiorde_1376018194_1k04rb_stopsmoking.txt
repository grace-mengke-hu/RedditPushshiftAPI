Has anyone found a good way to counteract irritability for the first 4 days?

I have quit smoking before for long periods of time, and am familiar with the withdrawal effects and how long they last for. Just a side note for those who haven't quite yet and are still thinking about it, it is very do-able and not as bad as you might think. Possible loss of sleep for the 2nd and 3rd night. If not sleep loss, there will be sleep disturbance. Unless you have sleeping medication, then you will sleep fine...but the quality of sleep might not be so great. For example, very little REM sleep (which is the most important sleep) so you might not feel rested. Other than that you will be irritable for the first 4 days, especially 3 and 4. After that you are riding the gravy train...just gotta deal with those little annoying cravings that last about 3 minutes.
But back to this post, have any of you found a way to decrease the irritability? I can deal with it, but I just don't want to annoy my girlfriend. Even though I can explain to her why I'm irritable, it's still an annoyance that I would rather not distribute.

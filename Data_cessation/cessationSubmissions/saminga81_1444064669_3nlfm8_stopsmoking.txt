Day 3...

Yesterday, I was hounded by cravings that nearly made me go insane.  I'm happy to say that I did not break.  However, I did smoke 1 this morning.  It wasn't my brand, tiny and quick.  (4 puffs)  This was 5 hours ago.  
  
Now I haven't had a single craving for those 5 hours.  I smoked up to 2 packs a day 4 days ago.  For me not to have any cravings since that one bastard of a cigarette is amazing to me.  As long as I can keep that up I should be fine.  
  
Thanks to anyone that (up or down)votes or responds.  I really appreciate the help and support.  Because of you guys, I actually think I can do it this time!

I can easily go a week on vacation without smoking or even thinking about it, but trying to go 24 hours at home in neigh impossible. Thoughts?

Just got back from 4 days out of town. Not once did I think about needing a cigarette. Decided to try quitting this morning, it's 16 hours in and I'm white knuckling my kitchen table wanting one so bad. How is it so easy in other environments but at home it's hard?

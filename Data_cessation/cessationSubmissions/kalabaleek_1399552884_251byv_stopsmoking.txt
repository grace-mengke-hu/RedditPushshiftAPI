One shaky week after 16 years with 1 pack/day!

Right, so a dear friend of mine was the reason I'm even here writing this.

**I'm as I said a shaky week in after smoking around a pack a day, every day for the last 16 years.** First three days was barely doable at all, so I had around three ciggies a day first two days and around five the third as I was out on a cruising night drinking beer. But compared to 20 a day it was still a huge improvement so I still count the first of May as the "quitting day".

I haven't had a single puff since monday morning. And it's a very surreal experience to not smoke anymore...

What it was to finally convince me to f*cking do this at last was my friend bringing two products I absolutely love that he said he payed for with the money he saved after he quit smoking.

***I'm an avid sim racer that really want to get a new set of solid pedals and an equally solid shifter for my rig, but I've been unable to buy it as I'm always smoking up all my extra cash.***



So what he showed me was this app **[Get Rich or Die Smoking](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GetRichOrDieSmoking&feature=related_apps)** where you can add a product you want to buy, set the amount of ciggies per day and the cost per pack - and the app will show you a percentage steadily going up towards 100% funding.

So I added **[this beauty](http://eu.fanatec.com/Shifters?product_id=676)** to my product list and it REALLY is encouraging me to avoid smoking! Combined with a mindset that I'm only fooled by these ciggies and nicotine chewing gum I'm breaking out of the claws of these bastard cigarettes!

**Thanks for this sub, it was a nice read to see you all in the same boat more or less. :)**

Trouble keeping blood sugar under control?

So i'm day 3 into quitting. Although I am not diabetic, I work for a company that manufactures glucometers and am in the habit of checking my BG after meals. Since quitting, i've noticed my BG is significantly higher than normal after meals with no change in diet. Example I ate a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee and an hour later took my BG and got a reading of 120. Normally would be somewhere in the 90's when in my regular smoking habit. I'm going to assume my BG is going to take a harder crash than normal when it does finally come down. I'm now starting to think that many withdrawal symptoms are actually caused by larger than normal swings in BG? Anyone else w/ similar experience? Thanks

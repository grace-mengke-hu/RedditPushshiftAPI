Going to quit again today

So, in february I decided it was time for me to quit. After a couple of half-attempts, I decided to watch trough all the Whyquit video\`s that finally made the "click" in my head to not touch a cigarette again, no matter what happens.

It turned out to be easier then thought. After a couple of days, the withdrawals wore off and I was a happy ex-smoker with only some moments of wanting a cigarette.

Unfortunately, 4 months after I had a couple days of heavy stress. After four months of quitting, the stress seemed to have induced the worst cravings I had since my quit date. I was feeling so overwhelmed, that I had a "Fck it" moment and decided to get a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of wine. Two weeks later; I was completely back to square one.

I Want to stop this ridicilous habbit for good. I have seen how better my life is when I\`m not hurting myself and feeling guilty  for it. I really, really want to become a non-smoker. I\`ve come to a point where health is no longer even the main reason for quitting any more. I\`ve seen "trough" the addiction and see how foolish it is. I don\`t want to go trough life as a fool anymore!

The one thing I\`m afraid of, is that I will relapse again when I get another period of despair where my logic thinking seems to disappear and I feel to have no power over my actions at that point, and I will make the mistake again.

I\`m going to do some more reading up and preperation and in 3 hours; I will smoke my last cigarette (Again :( )

I was bad, but it was worth it.

After 21 days of being free from smoking... I had one. Because I thought I missed one (it was offered to me). I thought it would scratch an itch in me. 

I HATED it. It instantly made me feel dizzy & nauseous. My lungs didn't feel relieved,  but rather they were instantly feeling dirty. On my way home, I coughed up black phlegm on the side walk. I wanted to rewind time as it didn't make a single positive thing happen inside of me. Oh, except one thing I guess, something that clicked: I don't want to smoke. I think that last cigarette was the thing I needed to prove I don't need/want them anymore, and to me that is so worth it. 

What a wonderful feeling.

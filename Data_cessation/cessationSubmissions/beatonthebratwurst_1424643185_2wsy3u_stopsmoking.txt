I just passed the one week mark overnight.

It's still quite fucking difficult. I'm pretty moody and am having problems with insomnia, and I have a couple moments each day at least where I catch myself thinking "AAARGH THIS IS RIDICULOUS I CAN'T POSSIBLY NEVER SMOKE AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I SHOULD JUST GO BUY A PACK!"

I'm not going to do it though, I'm in this for the long haul. I'm grateful this community exists, I find it very motivating to keep coming back and reading others' success stories.

Edit: Thanks for the support guys, I'll keep powering along one day at a time :)
Edit 2: I think my badge is a day behind my actual progress, possibly because I'm in Australia. I'm actually on 8 days now but it still says 7.

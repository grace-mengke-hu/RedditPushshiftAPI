Figured it was the perfect time

Been smoking since I was 18, i'm only 25. Went to go get my wisdom tooth pulled, they said no smoking for 3 days. I'm on day 5 now and I must say this is more difficult today than it was the last few days. I know I can do it, I feel like I can alreay smell/taste better. Getting urges has been tough, but I figured mine as well do it now.

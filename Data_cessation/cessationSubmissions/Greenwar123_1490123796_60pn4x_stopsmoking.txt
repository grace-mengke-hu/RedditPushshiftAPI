3 days in, and just relapsed.

I'm 30 years old, and I've been smoking since I was about 15 years old.

3 days ago ago I decided that enough is enough and tried quitting cold turkey. 

It had some immediate benefits for me, such as lowering my anxiety levels but it's the **fatigue** which ultimately got me to relapse.

I literally couldn't give two shits about anything, I slept all day and couldn't bring myself to be productive at all.

   

Does anyone here have experience with fatigue after stopping? If so, how did you deal with it? What helped, did it ever go away, etc?

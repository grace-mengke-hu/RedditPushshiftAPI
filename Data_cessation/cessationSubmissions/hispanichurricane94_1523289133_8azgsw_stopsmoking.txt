Really need help guys

I quit smoking before a few months ago after being diagnosed with gastritis (h Pylori still unknown, tests are in but waiting for the results). Was quit for five weeks but I've always struggled with clinical depression and those five weeks were miserable because I realized smoking (10-15 a day) was my way of dealing with the depression in general and really anything unpleasant in my life. My biggest triggers to smoke were being sad or angry. That being said I started again because of that and the doctor said I need to stop again so that the gastritis can heal. Been quit four days and I'm really struggling, and admittedly have smoked two cigarettes since I initially started. What I'm asking is for tips on how to stay quit when depressed?

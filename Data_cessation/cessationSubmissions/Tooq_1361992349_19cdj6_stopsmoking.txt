Day 366

Just a quick post to those thinking about or trying to quit:

I quit abruptly last year after having a heart attack while playing hockey.  The heart attack was mainly job stress (I own a company), but smoking for 24 years was really not helping either. 

Yesterday I celebrated one year of being smoke free (and heart attack free!) with a quiet dinner at home with my family. I sitll get the odd craving here and there but it's not a big deal. Once you get through the first couple of weeks, it gets easier and easier. I still do everything I used to do (go to the pub for beers, hang out with friends that smoke, etc), I just no longer smoke while doing so. Nicotine is a bitch of a drug and will trigger anxiety about not having cigarettes, not being able to smoke, etc. Just take a minute and realize that if you cave in, you reset the clock. After a few weeks, the cravings will have less impact and it will get easier to be a non-smoker. After a few months, you can go days without a craving, and near the one year mark, a few weeks.

If you're trying to quit or have quit recently, hang in there. For the first time in two and a half decades and since I a was a pre-teen, I know what a day without coughing and hacking is like. I feel better, smell better, and have more energy. You can get there too. Good luck.

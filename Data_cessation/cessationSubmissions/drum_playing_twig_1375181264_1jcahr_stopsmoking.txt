24 hours - Dear God, I can't do this. Help!

I'm sweating, pacing back and forth in my apartment. Nothing gives me joy. I could be watching the greatest films, playing the best video games, listen to the most awesome music, eating the most delicious food and everything would be dull by comparison to what a couple puffs would do. 

All I can think of is cigarettes. I can't focus on anything so I'm just sitting here battling the urge to run to the grocery store and buy a box of bad habit. I don't know what's keeping me.

Heeeeeeelp!

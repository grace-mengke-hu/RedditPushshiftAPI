I broke after a week

I've been reading this sub the past year. Working up the courage? to finally quit smoking.

  


I had an ear surgery last Wednesday. Walking into the hospital at 7am in the morning I tossed away my half full tobacco, my packet of cigarettes with 18 still in it as well as my lighter.

  


I felt so much better the past few days than I've ever felt before. The taste in my mouth right now is horrific. I'm cold sweating. I promised everyone I'm done.

My coughing has stopped, my throat isn't sore anymore after a little over an hour of no smoking, I'm sleeping better at night and it seems like my sleep apnea has gotten better or even stopped as I'm waking up early in the AM without a clock refreshed instead of tired... I thought long and hard about it tonight. I thought I wanted this "last one".

Instead my chest feels heavy and I feel like shit.

  


What have I done..

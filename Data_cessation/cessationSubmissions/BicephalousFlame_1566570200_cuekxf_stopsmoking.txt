I quit smoking 5 years ago

I was smoking, I had no intentions of quitting and I loved it. Then, out of nowhere I felt this faint pressure on my back, probably from sitting so much time, but I got really paranoid suddenly "What if it is cancer?" I thought. I had this realization of the possibility of smoking giving me cancer, like the kind of revelation you have suddenly about the idea of dying, like, holy shit, I'm going to die. So I threw my pack and never looked back. I tried it a month ago, just to know how it was, it was horrible, the throat hit and the taste were just awful. I still like the smell from afar tho. There is no point in this post really, maybe that fear can help you overcome your cravings? Dunno, good luck!

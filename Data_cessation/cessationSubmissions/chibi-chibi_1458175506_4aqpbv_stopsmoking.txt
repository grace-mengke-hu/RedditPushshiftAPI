Hi! It's been 26 hours since my last cigarette!

My doctor prescribed me 14mg nicotine patches. So far I'm not really that bothered. I'm sure the cravings will get worse. I find that playing my 3DS and reading help tremendously since I wouldn't normally have smoked while doing those activities.

I also have an electric cigarette with 18mg nicotine in it. I don't use it a lot, but I think it really helps with the cravings. If I get the idea that I want one really bad I just puff on that for about 5 minutes. 

I really hope I can kick this 18+ year habit. It does help that I can spend the money I used for cigarettes on new books and 3DS games! :) 

What do you guys do when you get cravings? I had quit for 10 days a month ago but stress from a small fight with my SO made me buy a pack. I'm trying to remain stress free this time around and am taking Klonopin 1mg twice a day so that should help, I hope!

Thanks for listening, and good luck to everyone trying to kick this nasty habit! :)

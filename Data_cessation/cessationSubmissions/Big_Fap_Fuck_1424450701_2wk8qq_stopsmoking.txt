50 days I've done so far

SO it has been 50 days so far. And boy do I feel a whole lot better. It is like a return to my childhood frankly. I am 27 and had been smoking since about 20 years old. So 7 years. Anyway, I love not smelling like cigs. Being able to smell things again with my nose. Not trashing my car with cig smell. Being able to actually workout somewhat efficiently. Admittedly I have very far to go in that department. But before when I tried working out, it seemed so futile. I love that my inverse for possible romantic partners has expanded fully. I love being quit, it's just great in every way. Still staying vigilant of course, but also just working hard on quitting marijuana and joining nofap. Anyway, thanks to this tremendous community. You guys were so helpful in getting me to where I am today.

Happy to answer any questions you might have.

For my future

For me. For my fiancee. For the family we will have some day. I am breaking the habit. I've lurked around here long enough, it's time to act. I work in the oilfield and constantly have people around me smoking. I didn't bring any to work and had a couple from a co-worker yesterday. But when I woke up this morning, I told myself I didn't want to be a smoker anymore and truly believed it inside. I want to see my children grow up. I want to grow old with my future wife. I will be healthy. Today may only be day one, but today marks the day I am no longer a slave to tobacco. You all are an inspiration and helped to remind me that I wasn't the only one fighting through the addiction today. I can do this.

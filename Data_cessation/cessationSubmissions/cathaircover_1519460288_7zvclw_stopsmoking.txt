Ready to quit but scared.

I honestly don’t think I can quit cold turkey. I’m 26. I started smoking when I was 11...typing that out is pretty disappointing. 15 years! I went through puberty addicted to nicotine! My brain doesn’t know how to function without it. What I’m trying to say is I’m a full blown addict. 

I’ve never really attempted to quit. Ive tried to just wake up and see how long I can go before I cave...normally its about 2-3 hours. One thing I notice every-time I do this is I get extremely light headed and I feel completely out of it. Is this a normal experience for most people? Getting light headed to the point where I feel like I want to faint?

I get scared thinking about what I’ve already done to my body at such a young age. What if I already have cancer? Is there such thing as a smokers physical? I feel depressed thinking about what my body would look like if I didn’t start at such a young age. I’ve always struggled to put on weight and I know smoking is one of the reasons. 

I’m also a coffee drinker. Coffee and cigarettes have been a dear thing to me for a long time now. I’ve stopped drinking coffee (for now) because I know thats a huge trigger for me and I’m trying to lay some foundation. Ive been reading this sub for a while now and I think weaning off with vaping might be the better route for me. I’m going through some very stressful stuff in my life right now and I think if I went cold turkey I’d kill myself. Literally. 

So tomorrow I’m going to buy a vape and see what happens. I’m trying to end this post with some type of conclusion but...honestly this is the first time I’ve really talked about my smoking habit to anyone, so...thanks for listening to me vent.

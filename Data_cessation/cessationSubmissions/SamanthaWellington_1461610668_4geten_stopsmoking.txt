Smoking Diary, and did any of you successfully quit after 'cutting down?'

I've been reading a few threads on here, and read from a few other resources that argue against cutting down smoking cigarettes in favour of quitting cold turkey, for various reasons. I can't really see any alternative in my case, I don't like the 'feel' of e-cigarettes, nicotine patches make me feel strange after a while, and quitting cold turkey simply isn't going to happen, not at the moment at least.


Over the past few days I've kept a smoking diary, because I tend to smoke at the same times each day, so I can objectively try to cut down certain cigarettes at certain times. Here's yesterdays...

* 3am - Couldn't sleep
* 6:45am - After waking up
* 7:20am - After breakfast
* 7:55am - Walking to the bus stop
* 8:05am - Waiting for the bus
* 8:30am - Before registration
* 9:15am - After registration/free period
* 9:30am - While studying/free period
* 9:45am - While studying/free period
* 10:00am - While studying/free period
* 11:15am - Break
* 1:30pm - Lunch
* 1:40pm - Lunch
* 2:00pm - Lunch/studying
* 2:15pm - Lunch/studying
* 3:30pm - After school/walking to the bus stop
* 3:45pm - Waiting for the bus
* 4pm - Waiting for the bus
* 4:40pm - Walking home
* 5:40pm - After studying
* 7pm - After dinner
* 7:20pm - While studying
* 7:35pm - While studying
* 8pm - While studying
* 8:30pm - After studying
* 10pm - Before bed


The past few months I have been smoking particularly heavily because I find it relaxes me while I study, but since October or November or so last year this is a pretty typical weekday. I don't smoke quite as much on weekends.

I'm throwing it all away, right now.

Needed to post this to keep my resolve moving forward...I've been smoking hookah on and off for 7 years and regularly for about 2 years.  There have been times where I've thought I was addicted, but then I would think, "You're not sucking dick to get shisha, so you're not addicted.  If you need to take a week off to go see family or go out of town, it's not a big deal."  But for the past few days I've had a pretty nasty cough.  The kind where you wake up at 4:45 AM because you're hacking up a lung.  The kind where you're spitting green mucous into the sink.

When it started, I thought there might have been something in the hose that I didn't clean out because I was out of town for a few days.  This morning I woke up coughing and decided to look it up on WebMD.  One cause, in particular, aligned with another unrelated health issue I've been having...smoking.

This morning I've started to realize that while I wasn't sucking dick for shisha, I was giving up a lot for a quick high.  Over the summer, I didn't do a lot of things I had previously enjoyed doing because I was worried about having enough time to smoke.  When things popped up in my day it raised my anxiety level because I was worried if I would have enough time.  I would lie, or at least not tell the truth, about what I was doing so I wouldn't upset my friends/family.  It was running my life in these small ways that you don't see when you're in it.

So right now my hookah, shisha, hoses, coals, and all of my other hookah accessories are going in the trash.  If I'm going to do this, I need to get it out of my sight.  I don't plan on there being much physical withdrawal, but I know there will be psychological withdrawal.  Filling that time, trying to replace the habit/addiction, anxiety, trouble sleeping, etc.

So that's why I'm coming to you!  Any similar stories, experiences, or just support will be greatly appreciated!

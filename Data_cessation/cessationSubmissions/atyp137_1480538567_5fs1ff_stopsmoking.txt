Need Quitting Partner?

So.. Ive tried everything to quit, recently therapy has helped, but its expensive and not available in tough moments. Was just wishing someone could be there that I could message about it - there are people in my life who i can talk to but theyre too invested and not smokers themselves.

I dont really know what Im typing, about to buy a pack, pretty out of it right now. On a scale from 0-10 the difficulty of quitting for me has been 9.9999 and counting. Someone figure out what Im trying to say here,maybe i can help someone too

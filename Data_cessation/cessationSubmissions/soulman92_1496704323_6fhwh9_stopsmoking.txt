Just relapsed after 2 years

Bought myself my usual pack of smokes on the way home from work and I've already had 2. Been really stressed in life lately with family and personal reasons which I guess isn't much of an excuse but I finally caved after 2 years. Don't really know what I'm doing, I feel like smoking anymore of this pack is just a bad idea but I'm kinda just giving up and figuring what's the point. Sorry for my rant, kinda of on my own on this and didn't know what else to do

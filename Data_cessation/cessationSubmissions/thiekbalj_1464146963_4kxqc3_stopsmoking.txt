The nothing method

I've tried everything, but I haven't tried nothing. I've been on this insane carousel for 3 years now after breaking a one year quit (2012-2013). Been on this sub off and on, reset my badge 2 dozen times. This morning I had 3 solid days in, and now at the end of the 4th day 3 packs of cigs (!!!) bought and thrown away. I'm really good at throwing them away, I've learned. Not so good at not buying them, not being an addict. So here I am, staring down midnight again, kids sleeping and I know that as they say in AA, I've reached bottom. There's nothing romantic about any of this, as a small part of me still believes. I've tried to understand this shit from every angle, tried the 1-800 quit line, meditation, running, Freedom From Nicotine, Allen Carr, etc etc. I know it's all in there and that I haven't gone deep enough (obviously) on any of these methods; at this point, I feel 'incurable'. I know that I'm not, that anyone can do this. So I'm going to move on to the nothing method: no buying it, no reading about it, no obsessing about it. These 3 things have been my undoing, I believe. I want to just begin again to re-learn my sober self, and adjust to being comfortable in my own skin without this insidious, trap-filled drug, without any and every moment of stress 'necessitating' a cigarette. Because it's not necessary; it's nothing. Thanks for listening and all the support and hard won insight that new and old quitters here give-it is truly life saving, I am going to join you all for good today.

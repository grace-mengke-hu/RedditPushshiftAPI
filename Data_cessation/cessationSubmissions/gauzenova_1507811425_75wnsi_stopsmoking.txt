Beating the temptation on the daily commute

I commute about an hour (sometimes up to 2 hours depending on traffic because DC is actually the first circle of hell) each way to work, and I usually smoke like a chimney the whole way. Well this morning it was in the mid 60s and I'm a weak little princess who hates the cold (aka anything below 75) and instead of bitching to myself about not smoking I rolled down the window for about 10 seconds. The cold air and the smell of smog from all the other poor bastards on the highway at 6am hit my face and I rolled the window back up and realized I don't ever have to sit through that again. Didn't even have a single craving the rest of the way to work. 
Hopefully as the weather gets worse and worse that'll be more motivation to keep smoke free.

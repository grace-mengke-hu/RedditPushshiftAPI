New subscriber, very happy to have been exposed to such an encouraging sub!

I quit on May 15th, which incidentally was the fourth anniversary of when I started smoking. The way I started smoking was, I went to an EDM show in 2010, took some drugs and smoked a pack. Been hooked ever since.

I'm excited to slowly start seeing the health benefits: breathing easier, tasting and smelling better, reacting to stress differently. This subreddit seems like a great community and I'm happy to be a part of it now. Thanks guys

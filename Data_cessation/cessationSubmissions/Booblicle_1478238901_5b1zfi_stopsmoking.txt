1111 days.

I don't really have much to say, but hope you all the best. It really is possible to quit, despite how far out of reach it may seem.  I smoked for more than half my life - 25 years. And never really saw an exit until I came across /r/stopsmoking and more importantly, a book that explained everything I wasn't figuring out for myself called **Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking**. I know there's going to be plenty that say it didn't work for them, or that there are other methods. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's not. But I've done much research along my path if only to prevent failure. That book in my opinion lays out the truth for you to see and use. Most of what prevented my failure came from it, and of reading the failures of others, so I do not trip over the same sticks. 

Speaking of sticks. Last month I came across , not one, 2 new packs of cigarettes on the ground on different days. I actually picked them up and gave them away to someone that 'needed' some cigarettes. I'm such a heartless bastard.

Smoke Free app

Hi, stopped smoking for 23 days now, quite happy about that!  Quit cold turkey but found the smoke free app for iphone really great.  It gives you all the stats about time money and health, but also, more importantly, it gives you a daily mission.  This is really a very good system for me, it makes you spend some time to try to reprogram your brains into being a non smoker!  Clever app, thanks to the makers!
One of the missions on the app was to try and help others by posting on a site what helped you... so this mission is completed!  thanks to all on this blog, you've helped me also!

Anyone here have any advice on how to quit vaping?

I've been addicted to nicotine for about 11 years. I started with smoking cigs and I got addicted to nicotine gum and nicotine spray. Then about 3 years ago I started vaping and for two years I rarely touched cigaretts. Now I've been fluctuating between smoking and vaping. I'm so sick of nicotine's control on my life and want to kick it for good.

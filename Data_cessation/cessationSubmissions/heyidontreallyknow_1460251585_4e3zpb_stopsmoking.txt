New Years Quitters -- 100 Days!

I know this is a couple of hours early but WE DID IT!

I've quit for a longer period of time before, but this has been my absolute best quit so far. I've had absolutely no cravings over the last 100 days from the moment I quit. I feel Allen Carr's words have finally sunken in.

Anyways congrats to the rest of you who have also stuck to your new year's resolution and keep it up!

Posted here a couple days ago about bad cravings, was wondering if anyone has tried taking chantix.

First of all thanks for the responses on my previous post. I just saw my psychiatrist and he recommended I give chantix a try. Now I do struggle with depression and anxiety and he said it can affect depression. I was wondering if anyone has tried it and if they had any negative/positive effects from it

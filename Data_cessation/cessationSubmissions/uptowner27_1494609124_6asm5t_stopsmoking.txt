Quit smoking a week ago due to a cold and feeling extreme withdrawal symptoms. Has anyone had these for extended periods?

31 smoke about 5-10 cigarettes daily for the past 5 Months. Prior to that I've been a social smoker (like 5 a month and often 2-3 months without any) for about 7 years. 

I caught a cold and had been smoking since the death of my dad. Figured let's quit. The withdrawal symptoms I have been feeling are unlike anything prior. Massive fever for the first 4 days peaking around 103, nausea, extremely dizzy and could barely walk. It all peaked 2 days ago with horrible feelings of anxiety after a hard decision call and having borderline panic attack. No one knows I smoked and people are getting concerned at what is wrong with me.

Im still extremely tired all the time (fell asleep on a couch for 2 hours today while working) and my head feels like it's in a vice constantly. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? I know asking how long is subjective but a friend just told me she had similar stuff for 2 months and gave up and started smoking again. Can it really last that long?

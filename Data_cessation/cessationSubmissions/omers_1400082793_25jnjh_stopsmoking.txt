100 days without a single cheat... feels good.

I quit cold turkey 100 days ago today and unlike previous times I've tried to quit I haven't had a single cheat in that time... no cigarettes, no prime times, not even a passing drag. 

I quit with my partner who has in the last month started smoking again but I am not letting it distract me from my own need to quit. For the first time I feel like this is "the time" and that I am a non-smoker. 

I wasn't going to post a milestone thread but there is something about my quitting that I think can help others: **I work in nightclubs and I throw 'raves.'** I'm a DJ and I'm a party promoter so every single weekend I am either at a club or a party and I am a drinker. The idea that "I am having trouble quitting because when I go out and drink I have to smoke" is nonsense and is only true if you make it true. 

When my cravings were at their worst and I knew I had to go to the club I didn't change my drinking because that would have been trying to control two things and would have made it more difficult, instead I controlled the voice in my head that was telling me that drinking and cigarettes were somehow linked... Drinking and cigarettes are no more linked than my morning routine was linked to smoking, or coffee was linked to smoking. The bond between the two is not unique, and it will only be a problem if you buy in to it being somehow special. 

You can drink socially without cigarettes.

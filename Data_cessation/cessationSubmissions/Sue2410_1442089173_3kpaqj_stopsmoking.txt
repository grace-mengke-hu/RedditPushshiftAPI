Fallen

after 3 weeks I have fallen off the wagon, smoking a whole packet over 2 days I am so angry with myself, I have a constant head dialogue that goes you want a cigarette no you don't yes I do etc. SMost times my logical self wins but yesterday I lost it. determined to keep going. very difficult sometimes as I live alone and don't work so there is no one to say you can do it, but I Will.

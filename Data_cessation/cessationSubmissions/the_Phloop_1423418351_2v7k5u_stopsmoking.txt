Day 1: My teeth itch.

I'm not joking.

This is me, about 18 hours since my last cigarette. My lungs feel like a gunked-up air-filter and my skin is crawling. I'm twitching ever so often. But the worst part is my teeth. They itch in a way that I can't scratch. I keep feeling for my cigarettes in my pockets and panicking because they're not there.

This is going to be a *long* 72 hours.

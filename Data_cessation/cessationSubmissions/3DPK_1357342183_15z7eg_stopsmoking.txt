I'm fine without a smoke until I think about quitting.

Then the anxiety piles up and I start to freak out. Any ideas on how to just keep my mind away from everything? I'm starting to think that subing to this reddit was a bad idea as it keeps putting the idea of quitting in my head and makes me freak out again. Though the thought of watching my days increase is making me happy.

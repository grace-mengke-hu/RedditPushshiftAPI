Three weeks down. Life is so fucking good.

At 31, I've smoked for half my life.  I'm about to round a month of non-smoking and I feel awesome.  I'm over the headaches, irritability and now I'm seeing smoking for what is:  Fucking bullshit

I don't feel like a hypocrite at the gym.  Food tastes better.  I'm saving money.  I have more self esteem.  I've put myself at less of a risk of cancer, dementia and Alzheimer's (the correlation between mental degradation and smoking was the last fucking straw).  I'm more productive, not just at work, but while working on projects and doing hobbies and chores.  It's awesome.

There has been one benefit I didn't expect as well:  Dating is a thousand times more fun and easy.  I never realized how many great girls might have been interested in me in the past that I never had a chance with because smoking was a deal-breaker.  I'm crazy about the girl I'm with right now and I can honestly say it wouldn't be happening if I was still smoking.

I never realized the best I could achieve was a percentage of my potential as long as I nursed my stupid addiction.  I'm at %100 now, I can fucking do anything.  Every cigarette was a reminder that I was weak, there isn't a part of my life it didn't affect.

Never Again.  Onwards and Outwards.

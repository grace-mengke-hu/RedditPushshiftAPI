Wanted to quit for a while, ended up quitting by accident while on vacation, worried I'll start again when I get back home.

I've been smoking for about 7 years now, and have failed to quit numerous times in the past. Now I'm on vacation with family, who are all against smoking and I feel bad if I did it while with them, and haven't had one for 5 days now. This was not planned, and I still have cravings but I'm trying to manage them. I really want to stop for good, might as well since I made it this far. I confident I can stay smoke free for the rest of the vacation which is another 4 days, but I'm worried I'll get right back into it when I get home.

I've noticed your environment really makes a difference, surrounding yourself with judgmental non-smokers might actually work haha.Where I live in Philadelphia, there are a lot of smokers and many of my friends smoke so it's going to be more of a challenge. So I'll give it an honest shot, as I've already made it over the 3 day hump.

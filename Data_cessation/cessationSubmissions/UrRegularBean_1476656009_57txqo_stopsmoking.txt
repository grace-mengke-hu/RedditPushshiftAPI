why I thought I didn't need to quit, and why I was wrong

So this is actually my first post on reddit. I really love this thread because it gives me confidence I'll be able to quit, love you guys. I thought I could give you something back with sharing my story.

When I started to smoke I saw no harm in it. I thought I had some 'good karma' or something for living a healthy lifestyle (regardless of smoking, ofcourse), which was ofcourse something I told myself. What harm could it possibly do? The horrible pictures on the packs of sigarettes, that won't happen to me...
I did not smoke a lot. Maybe 15 cigs a day, for about 3 years. Compared to my friends, it was nothing. Because people in my environment smoked a lot more I felt like it wasn't that bad.

Then someone told me about how smoking influences the way your body can recover from fitness exercises... (suprise, it's not good ;) ) So, I started to browse about what smoking acutally does to you... And yeez. I thought I knew. I mean, I knew, but not really, I closed my eyes for it. Even in moderation, smoking is the worst... 

So about 100 hours ago I quit. When I want to smoke I workout instead, or walk around the block. Even only now, I've never felt better! My energy levels are way up, I feel more motivated to go to the gym and can concentrate better.

I'm soo happy that I quit! I'll never touch a cigarette again. And I wanted to motivate you guys... Even when you smoke a little, you can feel a lot different when you quit!

Thanks for letting me get this of my chest. :)

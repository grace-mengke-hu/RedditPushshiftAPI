How to support/encourage a friend who wants to stop smoking?

Hello! 
Note: I honestly do not know many people who smoke/used to smoke (hence, I’m sorry if any of my phrasings are rude/insensitive; do let me know!!). 

Background: 
Last year, one of my good friends decided to stop smoking. When she first told me that she hadn’t smoked in 2 weeks, I said I was proud of her and told her to keep it up. Around first week of the new year, I met her again and she was still clean. 

But then school started and the stress got to her, so she got a pack of cigarettes and slipped one. (I didn’t really know whether it was ok to say “its ok” though, so I just continued listening) She told me about her struggles and as far as I could tell, she sounded kind of hopeless about quitting, especially since she tends to want to smoke when she feels too stressed. AFAIK, this is her first attempt at trying to quit. 

I did ask if she was open to getting professional help, (also for the benefit of her mental health) because I don’t think I’m in a good position to really help (other than listen and provide support of course), but thinking back on our conversation, I hope it wasn’t the wrong thing to say.  

Anyway, I’d like to ask, what are some things that I can do/say to encourage my friend? I’ve offered to work with her on finding new things that she can do to distract herself from wanting to smoke/relieve stress, so if anyone has specific suggestions that would be nice :) 


PS: e-cigs aren’t allowed where i am, so it isn’t an option  :/ 


Thank you! 
Hope everyone will be happy and healthy :)

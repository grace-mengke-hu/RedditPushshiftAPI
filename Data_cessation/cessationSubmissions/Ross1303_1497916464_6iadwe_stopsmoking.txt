5 days in

I've tried to quit a few times lasting anything from a day to a few months before. 
Some how this feels different and I dunt know why.

I went off last week out of the blue and bought the nicotine mini lozenge things and just decided I'd had enough.

Wow I'm night and day different so far. 

I'd been on say 15 a day maybe a few less. Have been at it 10 years minimum but recently I've been cursing myself each evening and promising to stop after the last pack had finished.

First day I was all over the mini lozenges and they helped out but have been using them less n less. I have had 1 cheeky puff of my wife's vape pen each evening but yesterday I went until 7pm without so much as a lozenge and today I took nothing with me to work and have simply had one puff on the vape.

My energy is through the roof compared to recently, my mouth tastes normal and my potential hypochondriac pain in the neck has completely disappeared. 

Oh n I've had a good few beers over the weekend and not a thing... drinking n not smoking has been the hardest thing in the past.

I do have bits of the day where I'm thinking a cig would be nice but they don't last long at all.

I know it's a long road but feeling positive so far. 

Anyone else felt madly more energetic early doors? Recommend this to anyone

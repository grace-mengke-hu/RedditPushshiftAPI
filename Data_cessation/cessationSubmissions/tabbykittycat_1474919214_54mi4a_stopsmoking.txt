I am done. Today!

I just finished what is my last cigarette.

I am ashamed that it has taken me this long. I am 11 weeks pregnant and quitting has been a struggle that I didn't expect to face, but I am done! I know the cravings will be hard, especially because my SO smokes heavily, but I am determined! I am hoping that this sub and sheer determination will allow me to stick to this. Any advice or success stories would be really appreciated!

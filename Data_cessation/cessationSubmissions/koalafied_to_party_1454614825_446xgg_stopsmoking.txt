Day 5- getting the hang of this

I had my last cigarette on 1/31 and it feels really good to be able to breathe again. After smoking at least 1/2 a pack every day for the past 8 years (with the exception of a few very short stints of failed attempts at quitting), this isn't as hard as I was afraid it would be. 

But I don't feel very proud of myself and I don't think I will until I have at least a few months under my belt. It's like, I've been here before and I failed so I don't want to start patting myself on the back to soon. Also it's such a bad habit to begin with... Like I don't throw myself a parade every day for not poisoning my grandma, why should I be so proud of not poisoning myself? I'm still glad that I quit and I really don't even crave them that often or strongly... I'm just kinda lamenting lost time to them

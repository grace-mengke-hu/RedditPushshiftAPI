Just decided to quit

It's not the first time I'm quitting. Have gone months without a single cigarette but get back into the habit somehow. Worried that this time it's gonna be the same. I have smoker friends and they think it's alright so I think one or two cigarettes now and then won't be that bad. Any tips or advice? I'm a medical student so I know all the health effects (I know it's bad). But sometimes I feel like I should live doing stuff like this and enjoy life, however short it is. Sigh.

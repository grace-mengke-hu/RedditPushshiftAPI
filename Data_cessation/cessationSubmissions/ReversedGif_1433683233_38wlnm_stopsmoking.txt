Estimating number of cigarettes per day

I'm trying to convince my mother to quit smoking and I'm planning to buy some NicoDerm patches for her, but I don't accurately know how many cigarettes she smokes per day. She herself occasionally smells of smoke, her breath often seems to smell of smoke, but I only occasionally do see her smoking, as she tries to hide it from me, and only ever one cigarette per session that I see.

What's a likely number of cigarettes you'd need to smoke per day to see this?

TL;DR: Mother smokes some not directly observable amount; Should I start her with Step 1 or Step 2?

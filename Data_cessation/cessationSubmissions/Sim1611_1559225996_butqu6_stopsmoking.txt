Ahh, the challenging moments!

So, just over three weeks not smoking, some NRT, but not heaps. Mainly reframing some thoughts (affirmations, CBT, Smoke-free app, journaling.) 
Have made it fine through some social events with cigarettes and alcohol around. Made it ok through some tricky times alone and after a couple of glasses of wine.
Tonight though, hardest. Relationship breakup messages, and “I’ve never loved you” messages, and lots of blame coming sorta out of the blue, and also from a drinking, adjusting medication, and low mental-health ebb from my (ex?-)partner has pushed the cravings up high along with the sadness.

Still, I haven’t smoked. Couple of nicotine lozenges and trying to keep my heart n mind from slipping into a slough of despond...
I am still a non-smoker. I love breathing fresh air, and I won’t use this as an excuse to punish myself!

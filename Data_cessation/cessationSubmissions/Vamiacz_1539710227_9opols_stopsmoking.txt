Today i realised that my 100th day without cigs that i've been waiting for already passed

Hey guys, i was posting here about 5 months ago that i cannot stop smoking for over a week and i was worried that im just too weak to stop. Well thanks to this subreddit and /u/WhiskeyRider69 and /u/unwashed_masses comments i found motivation to start over and i feel great about it. Thanks guys it meant a lot to me back then and it means a lot right now.

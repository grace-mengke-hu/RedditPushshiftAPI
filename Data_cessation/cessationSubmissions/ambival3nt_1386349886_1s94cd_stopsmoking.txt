Hello. In the midst of a massive shift of self.

Quit drinking 48 days ago. Today is the day that I get rid of smoking as well. The r/stopdrinking sub has been incredible in helping me abstain from drinking so here's hoping you folks are just as awesome :D

Wish me luck. Just gonna headbutt this thing cold turkey.

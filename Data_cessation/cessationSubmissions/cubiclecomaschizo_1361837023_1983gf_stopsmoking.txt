2 weeks and doing fine.

After somewhere around 8 years of smoking (20-25 a day in the latter 5 years) I've made the choice to quit. Granted I'm using Champix, I think I'm doing fairly well. No real cravings and don't seem to miss them so I'm more than happy and figure I should've done this a while ago.

However, there's one issue I'm wondering if anyone can advise on: I find myself over eating a bit. Ok, a bit more than usual. I already have a bit of an over eating thing, but now since I've quit smoking I find myself simply wanting to eat when I'm not even hungry. It seems to be out of shear boredom and in the last 2 weeks my belt line has reflected this. Not terribly... yet. But I don't want to let it get out of control. Any suggestions on a snack I can have in the office or at home? I already take some mixed nuts to work, which do me over well until lunch time. But I'd still like some alternatives. I'm thinking gum for the most part. Does anyone have any other suggestions or alternatives I've not thought of to fix the need for an oral fixation?

Repost of a PSA: *Beware of the "I smoked again and hated it" post*

Recently, a heavy flurry of this kind of post has been appearing in this subreddit again. It's nothing new but needs to be seen again after many  recent posts making exceptions for cigarettes that "don't count" since  they made them "wiser" or a {worthy cigarette";  It has been discussed before so here it is [One of the Many , Many Warnings and Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6ggxqr/psa_beware_of_the_i_smoked_again_and_hated_it/)

Remember, this is an archived post so you won't be able to comment  within that link  but you can do that here in this one. 

Thanks to the Original Poster and Commenters!

Triggers

So I recently decided to quit smoking. I’ve already gone down from 12 to 6 cigarettes a day and started using nicotine gum to help with cravings. 

I didn’t realize how many situations trigger me to smoke, and that I had such a set routine for smoking. Even just getting in my car makes me want to smoke, even though I took the ashtray out and chew gum.

Any advice on how to handle triggers while first starting out?

I really think we should have a sticky or something in the sidebar with links to Allen Carr's book or the video.

Because I've got to give this another go. And out of all the things that have ever helped - I quit the longest using the "Easyway." But I need help again. Anyone have the links? I'd prefer the video, but the .pdf is fine too if thats all I can get.

Thanks!

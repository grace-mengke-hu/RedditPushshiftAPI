Guys I have quit smoking, but I can't go a full day without just 1 cigarette.

Title says it all.  Basically I woke up a week ago and decided I wanted to quit.  I'm fine the whole day, until evening rolls around.  I just have to have 1 single cigarette.  Is there no harm in just having 1 per day?  I don't think I can do this cold turkey thing.

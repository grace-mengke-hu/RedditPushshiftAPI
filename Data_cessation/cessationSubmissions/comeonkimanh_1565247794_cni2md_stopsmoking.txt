Vietnam’s culture made me start smoking habitually

I lived in Vietnam for six months as a volunteer training special education teachers on new techniques and methods. I worked in schools in both Saigon and in rural areas. Everywhere, people smoked - and you could smoke anywhere you wanted, inside restaurants, cafes, literally wherever. Oh, and a pack of Jets was only $1 US dollar. 

Prior to Vietnam, I smoked only when I was drunk, but not every time I got drunk, I never even bought a pack myself, just bummed them from friends or strangers. I was fine with this because I didn’t have a lot of smoker friends in college and I tend to be filled with social anxiety so I didn’t always ask even if I wanted one. This, I was fine with. One or two cigarettes in one night, every couple months. Light social smoking, I called it. 

Then I moved to Vietnam and found myself overwhelmed and stressed with my volunteer duties. Normally, when I’m stressed, I smoke weed, and had that method from about 18yo to now (24yo) (I still smoke weed). But, I didn’t have access to weed in Vietnam and I wasn’t going to play around with the drug laws there. So, I resorted to smoking cigarettes as my stress reliever. 

Then I came back to America, and I was sure that I could just stop because I was back in the environment in which I didn’t smoke habitually before. Well, the habit followed me. 

I’ve been a habitual smoker for about 1.5 years now, and I want to quit. I notice it getting worse, more cigs more often. I’m at about 7-10 cigs a day. 

Also, I find myself loving the feeling of being high on weed and smoking a cig. Does this mean I need to stop smoking weed too as to not trigger the desire of wanting a cigarette after a joint? 

Just seeking advice in the general realms of how to quit, if I should quit weed too, or if I should go back to using weed as my sole “relaxer” when I’m stressed (generally all the time).

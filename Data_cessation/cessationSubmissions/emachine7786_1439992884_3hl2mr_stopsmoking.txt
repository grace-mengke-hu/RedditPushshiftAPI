One week down!! :-)

I am so excited to say I finally completed an entire week nicotine free!!! It's so amazing how many things have changed. My sense of smell is incredible (much to my chagrin in some cases), my breathing is better, smoker's cough is almost gone with the exception of coughing up all the junk in my lungs, my fingers are no longer yellow, and all my clothing smells like drier sheets. I couldn't be happier! I did it, YOU can too! :-)

Have another infection, guess this means it's time to quit.

I'm spewing up truly disgusting stuff and I can't help but blame it on my cigarette habit.  This is the second time I've had a respiratory infection this year, and I'm sure smoking has made me more susceptible to them.

I've only been smoking for six years but have spent over 20 grand on cigarettes, and that makes me so sad.  I could have gone on the trip of a lifetime and finished my tattoo sleeve.  I could have spent it on literally *anything* else and it would have been a better idea!

My body is telling me to stop and I'm going to listen.  I'm out of smokes and will not buy a pack today.  Thanks for listening.

One last pack

So I got one last cigarette pack and I want it to be my last. I’m in the midst being done with drinking, but cigs they are tough man. Mostly because it’s a manageable addiction. With booze I was pile driving myself into a slug fest of anxiety filled hangovers. With smoking it’s a great bullshit break from stress. How did you guys quit. I was successful for 2 weeks before but drinking screwed that’s up. So I think if I keep the booze away i will be good. How did u guys beat the hump?

Just quit! Question for you guys

So it's only been two days but so far so good. I guess my main concern are facing all those moments where I love to smoke. For instance, I often get coffee outside with friends in the Spring and have always loved smoking as we watch the day go by before us. I feel like I will miss smoking immensely in those moments. How are those instances for you after not smoking for a while? Do you actually miss it or does it just seem like you'll miss it when you first quit?

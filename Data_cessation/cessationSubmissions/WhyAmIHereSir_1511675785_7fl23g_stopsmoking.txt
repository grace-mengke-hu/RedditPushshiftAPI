My younger brother just started smoking. I am at a loss. Need advice

I just need advice. I have two brothers, one older and one younger. Growing up my dad was always an avid smoker. We all HATED that he smoked and constantly begged him to quit. Well, he now has horrible heart disease and nearly died of a heart attack a couple years ago. 

After my older brother went to college, he came back... a smoker. That was 7+ years ago and he has never tried to quit. 

My younger brother just graduated highschool and is taking a gap year, if you can call it that. He has absolutely no direction in his life and just sits in his room all day. Well, I went in his room and it reeked of cigarette smoke. I have told him year after year, month after month how absolutely devastated I am that our older brother and dad still smoke and now he goes and does this. I am BEYOND pissed. 

I want to know if there are any words or pieces of advice you can share with me. I haven’t confronted my brother about this yet and I want to do it right. I want him to know what he is risking and how horrible of a cycle it really is. I just don’t want to come off as the bitchy sister. I really care about him.

F*** it, I'm done. The struggle starts today, and I will celebrate everyday that I spend nicotine-free

I'm done with the headaches. I'm tired all the time, there are days I have to stay in bed for hours because of how crappy I feel; and I know cigs have a lot to do with it. Have been on and off, spending days at a time not smoking, and the difference is shocking. But now, after 3 years of addiction, I'm hopefully dropping everything for good. 

Felt like posting this would help me make this a definitive thing. 

Wish me luck, and good luck to all of y'all.

What's your resting heart rate and how do you rank?

One of the most tangible aspects of quitting for me was to see how my resting heart rate improved within days of not smoking.

As smokers, we all dread the big C, but are far more likely to develop cardiovascular problems.

At any rate (pun intended), my resting heart rate before quitting was 80 bpm on average, and I used to think this was ok because I exercised regularly. Within days of quitting it dramatically dropped to the 60's! I just measure again and it's 62, which rates excellent formy age group, right below athlete level: http://www.topendsports.com/testing/heart-rate-resting-chart.htm

I measured with the heart rate app called Cardiograph, including those pre-quit measurements.

So, what's your resting heart rate and how does it rank?

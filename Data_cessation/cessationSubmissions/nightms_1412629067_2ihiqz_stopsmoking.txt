Sorry for I have failed.

So, the early morning of the sunday I had a conversation very tough so I smoked 3 times a pipe ( I guess it's like 1 cigarette, don't know, and I din't pass it). I was very proud for manage almost 3 months and now I feel shit, I hope that now that I had a relapse the hellish cravings don't come back. It's a strong path but i chose it and i need to be stronger.

P.S. Do I have to remove my badge an request it again?

What should someone, trying to stop smoking, do?

My dad's been smoking for almost 48 years and he's finally trying to stop. He's been slowly smoking less. What can help him? Some of my friends have suggested he use e-cigarettes, but I don't know if that would help.

Also, he's been sick more frequently and for longer durations. Is this because of the nicotine or lack of? He also doesn't eat healthy food. Is it because of that or a combination of the above?

9 day check in and 25lbs gone!

So exercising 40-50 mins a day 5 days a week is really staving off the depression I was having and having a doctor that actually listens I'm noticing is probably the most valuable tool you can have!

I'm not talking about the normal everyday oh you have to quit doctors, I'm talking about doctors that will sit there and explain things to you and ways you can cope.  Also will listen to your struggles and even depression.

I live in BFE and had to travel all the way to Lansing, KS for a doctor that would finally listen.  SHE IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME AND THE BEST PART......I'M LOOSING WEIGHT NOT GAINING IT! 9th day, 25lbs gone (had 3lbs of water weight come back on on cheat day but then it's gone now) by the time I'm one month quit who knows lol might be 50lbs lighter.

Having the right tools like doctors, NRT some times, exercise like a gym to MAKE you go.  I mean you spent even just 22 bucks a month on a gym membership don't you want to get your money's worth?  Also eating right, I notice when I eat lower carb I have lower cravings. It might be the sugar thing....

Quitting smoking can lead to another thing and another thing and another thing it really can.  Before you know, YOU'LL WANT to eat healthy food or you'll want to exercise instead of smoke!

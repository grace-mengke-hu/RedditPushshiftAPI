Boyfriend and I stopped smoking yesterday...

He texted me, "I'm quitting smoking right now." I said, "okay, I will too." And had one last cigarette when I got off work. Haven't smoked in... 19 hours? Something like that. I'm not too crazy yet, just a little short tempered. 



Anyway, we lay down to go to bed and he pulls out Snus. What? I thought you quit smoking? Maybe chewing and smoking are different? He said he didn't want to talk about it and went to sleep. 



I don't know what to feel about it all. I feel cheated in some way. Like, I'm going through withdrawals and he is just fine with chew in his mouth.


Whatever, I suppose.

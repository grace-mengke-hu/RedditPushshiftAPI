Almost 2 years with no cigarettes.. I want a cigarette.

I quit smoking almost 2 years ago after being a half a pack a day smoker for 5 or 6 years. 

I quit cold turkey, and was very excited to see my life improve in many ways-- I did better at work because I did not have to leave all the time to have a smoke break, I smelled better, my skin cleared up, I could breathe and best of all I was able to dive head first into physical fitness. I started working out like crazy and taking HIIT classes and spin classes, and I even ran a half marathon.

Well for the past couple of weeks I've been begging my friends for a cigarette when I'm drinking. Luckily, no one has given me one yet. I've thought back to the days a few years ago and I'm nostalgic for that time. I feel like I lost a friend in my life (cigarettes). I can't really explain why I want to smoke so bad but I do want to smoke.

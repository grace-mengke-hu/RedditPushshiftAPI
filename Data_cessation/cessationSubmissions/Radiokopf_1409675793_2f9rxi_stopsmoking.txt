Bearer of the purple badge!

I've made the first 4 weeks and i dont know what to say: it wasnt hard at all, or it was a hell of a ride. I guess both would be equally true. The main thing to keep: not smoking. Im kind of ill with sinusitis, somehing i always got when i quit for 1 month+, last time it took 2 to break out. It wan't until this time (the 3rd over a month) that i start to belive its comes with the better cirulation of the sinus and is a normal sign of regeneration.

Friday it will be a Month and i will have my star, i will have to wait 3 Month then until i get purple again :(

Also, and i dont know if it comes from beeing sick, i thing i have the first toughts about "starting again". I did not forget that the most fall back to the drug after 4-6 weeks :) so i will not

Have a nice day!

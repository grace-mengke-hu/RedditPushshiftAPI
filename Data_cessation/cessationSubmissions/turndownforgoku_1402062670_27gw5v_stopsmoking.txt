Can barely hold it together

I'm only 16 (nearing on 17) and I've failed at quitting more times than i can count. This is the first time I've felt resolute about doing it, but its come to that stage where I feel like smoking is what allowed me to keep a check on my stress levels even though i know its not true I cant help but feel that I'm gonna go insane.

Why did I quit smoking again?

I stopped smoking a month ago. It wasn't exactly a big deal, yet I'm not sure if it's worth it.     
I started smoking in order to self-medicate my depression/bad mood issues, and the nicotine did a great job helping me feel better. Now that I quit, I've reverted back to the old ways: sad and anxious. Social smoking was also great and helped me meet tons of new people.    
Do you guys know any alternatives(that don't involve psychologists and other annoying stuff) to that? Sure, the health benefits of quitting are strongly visible and plenty, but what's the point if I'm sad all the time?

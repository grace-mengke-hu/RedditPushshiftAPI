Hello.

Hi my name's Loi and I just turned 18. I quit nicotine about for about 2 months now. I started off with vaping and then it turned from mods to juuls and then i broke my juul and the onyl access to nicotine ending up being darts and i just kept intaking more and more nicotine. The entire experience from first starting till me quiting was probably only 2 years but the withdrawals were terrible. Recently however any time im stressed i get such strong urges to smoke or vape again and with most people my age have vapes its such a hard urge to resist. Any good advice on resisting these urges? Advice and encouragement would be helpful!

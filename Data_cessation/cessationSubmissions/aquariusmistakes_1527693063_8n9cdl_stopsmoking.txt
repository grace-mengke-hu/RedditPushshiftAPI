So I had 3 cigarettes left, I just smoked half and tore the other 2 up

I just went outside to smoke, and halfway thru my cigarette, I felt disgusted! I threw it out. And I just tore up the last 2! I know in a hour or so I will crave another one BUT I am tired of this life! I'm tired of smelling like smoke, I'm tired of my friend walking away in disgust when she smells the smoke when I light up when we go out to eat or hit the town. I'm tired of the cravings controlling me. I know that if I don't stop now. I will die. 

So here begins NOW the journey of quitting cold turkey. I'm sure I will be posting here frequently. But I am determined and willing to get thru these cravings.

God be with me!

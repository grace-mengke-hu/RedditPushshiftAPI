Day 2 Disaster

After an easy day 1, day 2 was a disaster:

* Woke up at 3am with a bad case of night sweats. 
* Couldn't get back to sleep.
* Was really tired all day and was dozing up while working at my desk.
* Had to take a full break to go nap inside my car.
* Angry and agitated all day.

The good parts:

* Acid reflux is all gone! No meds!
* I have a nose and it works.
* Took the best dump of my life today. I'm not sure why some people say smoking helps constipation, for me it's the opposite.

Got home and now I am in a better mood. Ready for Day 3.

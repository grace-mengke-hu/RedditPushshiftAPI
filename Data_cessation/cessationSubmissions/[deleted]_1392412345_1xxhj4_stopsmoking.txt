After wish-washing around for a month, it's gotta be today

I "quit" smoking on New Year's and lasted two weeks. Then a good friend who I highly associate smoking with came to visit and I broke down and sat outside smoking cigarettes and drinking with her all night. Then I lasted another week but the seal was broken and slowly I've been smoking more and more cigarettes more and more frequently. I bought my first pack a couple of days ago. I've been getting fed up with myself about it and today, I saw the article about how cigarettes exacerbate depression. I figured, what the hell, today's a better day for quitting than tomorrow. Here goes nothin'.

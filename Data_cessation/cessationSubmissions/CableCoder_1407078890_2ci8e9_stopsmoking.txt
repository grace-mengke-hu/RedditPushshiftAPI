4 Days in, still going strong

Thanks to this sub, the app MyQuitBuddy, and walks, I'm still going strong!  For the first few days, my body definitely didn't like me.  But I can already feel the positive effects.  My skin is becoming less sallow, and my teeth are becoming whiter.  
  
It is still tough in passing moments to say no.  Walking by an ash tray, or someone smoking on the sidewalk.  I feel like I can smell them from a hundred feet away, even when driving behind someone who is smoking.  But whenever it gets too bad, I pull open this sub and read about all you fine people!  
  
Seriously, thanks to everyone for sharing their stories.  I never had a support system before, and it is amazing how much more effective quitting is with one.  
  
PS:  
Thank you Australian Government for the My Quit Buddy app.  That thing has saved my ass more than once.

Had a very stressfull few days - about to cave.

In short, my hometown is [almost completely destroyed](http://euronews.com/2014/05/19/obrenovac-serbia-s-flood-hit-ghost-town/), my childhood home (my mother's house) is completely flooded. It took us two days to find all the members of the family in the various evacuation centers around Belgrade. I've been volunteering with in the centers during the weekend so I managed to keep busy enough not to think about it. 

However, the work week came, and it's coming back in waves. I'm a programmer who works from home, and I currently work two jobs, one of which is tedious and the other very demanding (I'm the only guy doing the job of a small team). And I'll be working both of them for the foreseeable future, seeing as my mother and most of my family are jobsless now. And of course I'm worried that I might not be able to pull it off at all. 

I wouldn't blame myself if I caved and started smoking again - I simply don't want to because I've made huge progress. Still, I get these terrible cravings and sweats at least three or four hours per day, and I can barely think of anything else. If anyone has any useful advice, please share. Thanks!

fucked up on my first day.

So i stopped today and i fucked up today. All day long I've been in a shit mood, sleepy and motivated, and I fucked up, went and bought a pack 10 mins ago and smoked a cigarette. I was so disappointment in myself I threw away the rest of the pack. sorry i just needed to share this with someone.

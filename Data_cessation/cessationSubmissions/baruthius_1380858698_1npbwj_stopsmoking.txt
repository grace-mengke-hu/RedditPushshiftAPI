6 months 100% clean today. Thank you all so much for being amazing!

Today marks half a year of being totally clean. I went from smoking a pack a day to just quitting cold turkey and i feel fan-FUCKING-tastic. I have so much more energy, I'm eating healthier, I've saved SO much money, and I can exercise. That last one is key. Not only am I gaining the benefits of not smoking, but I can also run without having to stop after a couple minutes to cough my lungs out now, so that's great. I just wanted to let you all know that it is absolutely possible and that it is unbelievably worth it. I don't really post much here but I read all of your comments and posts and I love how supportive this community is. Keep on keeping on, friends.

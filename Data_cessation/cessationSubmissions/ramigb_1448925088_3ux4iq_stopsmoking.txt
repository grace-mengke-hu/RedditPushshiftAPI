24 Days and the real bad carvings just started is this normal?

Today was a very hard day! i had some strong strong craving! nothing has changed i hang out at the same "smoke infested" areas i hang out in always and i see the same people and deal with the same stress! is it normal to have real intense craving now? i thought it's just the first three weeks! :( i appreciate your feedback guys. 

edit: spelling.

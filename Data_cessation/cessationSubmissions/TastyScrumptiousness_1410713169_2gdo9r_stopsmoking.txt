Day 1!

I smoked my last cigarette about 3 hours ago. I quit previously for a whole year after reading Allen Carr, but then stupidly had "just the one" at a party and fell right off the wagon. That was about 5 years ago and there have been multiple failed attempts to stop again in that time. The difference this time is that I am starting a whole new chapter in my life, I finished my rat race job on Friday and starting back to university tomorrow for a full time masters. New life, new habits, and the last thing I want to is to know where the smoking area is or start making friends with the smokers. So I sped-read Allen Carr again over the last couple of days, and I am absolutely determined that this is it, I am now officially a happy non-smoker!!

Just wanted to share with all you lovely quitters :)

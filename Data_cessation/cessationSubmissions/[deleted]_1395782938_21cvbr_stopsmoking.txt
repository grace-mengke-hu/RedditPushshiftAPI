2 weeks in. Can't sleep.

I always thought sleep was supposed to improve, but I am waking up every night around 4 am, then going into what I call dozing. I slip into a dream state, but never really fall back asleep. It is making me lethargic, and grumpy, Has anyone else had this happen? I am using an e-cig so that is probably causing it more than the not smoking, but I am desperate to get a good nights sleep.

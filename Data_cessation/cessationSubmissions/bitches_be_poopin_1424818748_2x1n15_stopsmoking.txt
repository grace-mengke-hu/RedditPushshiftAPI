About to get crunk for the first time since quitting

Not really. I've never been much of a drinker. Plus my fantastic SO quit drinking a couple years ago, so our home is alcohol free. I usually only drink a couple times a year. My best friend's boyfriend is out of town so we're having a lady-date sleepover with snacks, a pillow fort, and RuPaul's Drag Race. And since work's been a nightmare for a few weeks, there will be wine. 

I haven't had a sip of alcohol since I quit smoking, so I'm nervous. I mean there won't be any cigarettes or smokers around and my friend is super supportive of my quit and won't let me trip up, so there's no real reason to worry,. But just the thought of booze has my addict stirring. 

Send good vibes, my most excellent friends! I won't smoke tonight (in my fort) if you won't! 

Edit/Update- It was totally fine. Our fort was too awesome for me to even think about smoking. You guys should all make forts.

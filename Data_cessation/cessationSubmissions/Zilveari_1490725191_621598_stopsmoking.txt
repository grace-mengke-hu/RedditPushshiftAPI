Never stop trying to stop

Thought I would pop in for the first time in a while.  I never thought my flair would get this high.  Started smoking when I was 14, continued for nearly 20 years.  I always that that I was a weak human being.  Weak-willed, no determination, etc.  Tried to quit half-heartedly a bunch of times to no avail.  
  
But even for someone like me who deals with anxiety, depression, self-loathing, etc has managed to kick the habit and stay off of it for over 3 and a half years.  It took a lot of attempts, but I made it.  I was unemployed by layoff, ran out of unemployment, was deeply depressed and couldn't afford to see a councilor or get drugs.  I couldn't afford to smoke, but I kept buying them.  I lost weight because I had started trading nutrition for nicotine.  
  
Then I had a moment while watching a documentary about addiction.  Or it may have been a history show, not sure.  I can't remember the exact line that was said but I remember the thought I had.  That when I smoked a cigarette I was not making myself feel *better*.  I was making myself feel **normal**.  That expensive habit did not make me feel better than other people.  It put me BACK to normal.  
  
That one thought fucked my head up.  That thought was what lit a fire under my ass.  I had a pack and a half left.  I was done.  I forced myself to taper off and not buy any more.  I stayed away from my car.  I stayed away from World of Warcraft.  I sat in different furniture at home.  I ate at different times of day.  Anything I could do to not trigger it.  A week later I was dry, and this time I was finally successful.
  
Even if you relapse, DON'T GIVE UP.  Gather strength from everything in your life that you love and try again.  And again.  And again.  It's never too late to try to quit.  Even not smoking for a month could give you more time to spend with your family, friends, bug collection, anime waifu, whatever.

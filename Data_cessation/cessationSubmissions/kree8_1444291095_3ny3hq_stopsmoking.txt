Please let it only be two...

I'm ready to quit. I have been at this many times before but recently my body is just not feeling right. I have to make this work. I got liquid for my ecig but what I really need is discipline. I woke up today and instantly lighted up during my morning ablutions then again for the morning cup of tea. 

I'm going to take this hour by hour.

cheers everyone and all the best with your goals.

edit: I'm up to four cigs for today. :(

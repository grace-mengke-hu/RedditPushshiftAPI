Allen Carr's Easyway

Read the book but i don't feel the "excitement"... i mean, should I? Really? Do i need to keep reading it until i feel it? I think i understand his message pretty well. Does something just click in your mind? I guess his references to being a miserable smoker that doesn't smoke with a life of always wanting a cigarette vs. a happy non-smoker are making me nervous... obviously I'd prefer the latter.

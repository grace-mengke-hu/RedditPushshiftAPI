Can't seem to stop thinking about cigarettes

Obligatory "I've been lurking on this this thread for a while." I'm relatively new to Reddit, but I need some advice on how to quit for good.

I've been smoking for slightly over three years, averaging about 15 cigarettes a day. Being a broke college student, I ran out of money and I cut off cigarettes for two and half months. After a really depressive couple of months, I lit up again and increased my intake to about a pack a day. I read Allan Carr's book and it helped tremendously. Now, I can't seem to find the motivation to quit. I got a new job with aggravating colleagues, and while I know that's just an addict's excuse, it feels legitimate.

As a premed student nearing graduation, I need to quit soon. Not only that, but my campus is going smoke free in August. My biggest problem is that I never noticed benefits in those two months I quit. I have always had pretty strong cardiovascular health, so I didn't notice breathing any better. Even two and half months in, I was still thinking about smoking almost daily. Does that get any better? I need to know there is hope.

I'll be rereading Carr's book soon, but does anyone have more unconventional tips? Will I ever stop thinking about smoking? Will I ever be able to go drinking without wanting to light up? Thank you in advance for the help! Keep being awesome, guys!

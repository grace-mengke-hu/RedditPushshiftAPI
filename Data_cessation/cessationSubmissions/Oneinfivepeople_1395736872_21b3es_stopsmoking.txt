A personal story to motivate you to quit

On Friday night my Dad's heart failed - he lives alone and I happened to be visiting earlier than usual and he was rushed into intensive care and survived. The cardiologist consultant explained that he had already had one heart attack in his sleep, and his heart had another on Friday before failing in the evening. 

He has smoked 20-40 cigarettes daily, with only a few small quitting attempts for 60 years. Even with the lower end of the estimate, that's HALF A MILLION CIGARETTES. 

If he continues smoking, he's been given 6 months to live. But with stopping smoking, he's got between 4 and 5 years. Years with pain control. And frequent medical monitoring. And home adaptions. And an oxygen tank. And exercise. And a new diet. And home help. And deterioration which will mean giving up driving toward the end. And palliative care.

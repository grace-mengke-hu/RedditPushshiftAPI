Quit buddy?

I've been a lurker for a few months here. I really want to take the leap and quit finally. I'm reading Alan carrs book right now. 

I'm hoping to maybe find someone else who wants to choose a day to quit with me, we could kik or Skype text, hold each other accountable, talk  through cravings or whatever else. Anybody interested? 

Btw, I'm a 26 female, and June will be 10 years that I've been smoking, I'd like to say I'm a non smoker by the 10 year mark!

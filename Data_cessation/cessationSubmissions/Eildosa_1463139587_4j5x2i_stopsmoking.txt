So I went cold turkey, but...

Hi, I've been smoking 1 to 1.5 pack a day for the last 5 years.
4 days ago I stopped (monday afternoon), as I lit a new one I looked at it and said 'no more'.
I still have my pack on me, it kind of make me proud to know that it is there and that I'm not
using it by my own will.

First day was hell, when someone talked to me I just wanted to punch him, I needed silence.
Second day was bad but not has bad.

RIght now I still get craving sometimes, it's more about situations.
I had the habit to lit a cigarette each time I went outside or after a meal, in those situations
my hands go in my pockets without me realizing it, then I'm being made aware by my brain that 
there is no cigarette in my pocket and that I want/need to smoke, it usually last 10-20 minutes.

My problem, I also drink, and as you may know alcohol greatly enhance the cigarette feeling.
I was to a bar last night, I didn't smoke but I wanted to and it made me really sad to not
being able to.

I mean ok, when you are a regular smoker your hourly cigarette do not produce any effect, they
just allow you to not start feeling the withdrawal.
But when smoking while being drunk you get the same pleasure as when you took your first cigarette,
for every cigarette you take during that night.

Which brings me to this question :
Would it be possible in 2-3 month to smoke 1-3 cigarette once a week (when drinking).
Or would it turn me back into a smoker right away?
I have 4-5 friends who are not smokers and just smoke 1-3 cigarettes when we go out to get
some drinks.
But I fear that just one cigarette would reactivate all my habits (need to when going outside, 
after a meal, etc)

What do you think?
Thanks.

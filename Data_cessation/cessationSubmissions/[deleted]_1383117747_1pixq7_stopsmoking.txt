About to lose my only reason to not smoke

I have had recently had a severe cold, tonsil trouble (can't really translate) and my throat simply hurt too bad to smoke, I was barely even able to swallow without feeling terrible pain. So although I wanted it really badly, I knew it wouldn't feel good and it might only make things worse if I smoked. Now I'm starting to feel better, and I'm scared that I'll lose the one thing that was keeping me away from smoking, and I don't know how to motivate myself. 
Also I still have 3 days off-school so I'll be home alone all day, everyday and a part of me keeps telling me that I shouldn't be wasting such opportunities to smoke (being home alone and not smoking = waste of home aloneness).

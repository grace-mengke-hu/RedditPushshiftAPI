Day 1

I'll be back in 7 days hopefully with good news. I have quit for extended periods of time but I have got back to a pack a day. It hurts to do my normal excerise routine and I'm so gassed I can't bring myself to do go for a jog. 
My coworkers, friends and even some family members smoke. I used a vape for the first month then quit for almost a year last time. 
I recently just got some new vape oil in varying strengths and I plan to stop consuming any aids in a month or so. (Roughly the supply)
I'm dissapointed I relapsed but deep down I really thought I had it under control and it was my decision to enjoy the that first cigrette again. Oh was I wrong to do that, I totally underestimated how it plays tricks on people.
I really hope I don't come back for a week or it probably won't be good news.
Right now there are a couple changes I'm making in my lifestyle and this was a no brainer.
My triggers are after lectures, working at my night job and drinking. As long as I put myself in non-smoking places I should be okay. 
I'll be reading other new quitters, it's nice to know that other people are going through it too.

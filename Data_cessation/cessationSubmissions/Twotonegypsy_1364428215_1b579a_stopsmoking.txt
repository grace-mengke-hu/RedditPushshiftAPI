I made it one week!

And my chest hurts like a bitch!  But not in the normal way like I have a lack of breath, it is more like my lungs pushing the nasty gunk out of themselves.  God it feels good!  I am becoming a nonsmoker.  That is my goal.  When I friends and family and coworkers no longer think of me as a smoker, or notice me as one.  

Honestly this sub has been great help.  On my days off from work, when I sit on the computer and start to get that itch I go onto /stopsmoking and know that it is possible.  

Edit: I forgot to add how I started my awesome journey.  A guy at worked asked me if I have ever done a German inhale?  I said "What is a German inhale, like a french inhale?"  He said "No.  A German inhale is when you take a nice long drag, than hold it and swish it around in your mouth for about 15 to twenty seconds, or until you feel you can't really hold it any longer, and then suck all that and some air in as quickly as possible.  Like just open your mouth and inhale as hard and as fast as you can."  So I tried it... and I fucking started to die.  I coughed as hard as ever and couldn't stop coughing for the entire day.  Every cig after that tasted like shit and made me feel nauseous and gave me the worst headache.  Honestly, I think that stupid bar stunt saved my life.

Trying NO-vember

Going to attempt to say no to several things beginning yesterday. Soda, cigarettes, and candy. Also, as much as possible, I'm going to ride my bike to work when weather is forgiving. I'm hoping the bike helps with the nicotine cravings. I hear working out can help. I've been smoking for seven years now, and every cigarette now is more a reminder of my inability to quit than it is an enjoyment. I'm glad this support group is here.

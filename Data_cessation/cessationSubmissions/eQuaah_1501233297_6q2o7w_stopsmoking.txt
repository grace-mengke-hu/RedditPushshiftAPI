Stopped smoking -> better at video games

Hello ,
I'm really curious about if smoking effects our cognitive behavior in a way that I'm getting better again at video games like COD where you need relatively fast reflexes and make those tiny movements with your controller , because my hands are trembling way less and don't feel so numb anymore.

I know smoking constricts your blood vessels in your hands and feet but I didn't know that it had such an effect on cognitive function 
I'm now again at 16 days smoke free and everytime I hit the 10-12 day mark I notice that I enjoy video games way more in way that I'm as good as I was "young"/ before nicotine addiction.

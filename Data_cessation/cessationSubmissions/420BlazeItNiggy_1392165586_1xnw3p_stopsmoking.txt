Newbie question

Hey guys. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 days, but I have been smoking my electronic cigarette. I feel like my sex drive has increased already and returned closer to how it was when I started smoking. Do you think it's a placebo effect or could it actually be returning already? Thanks guys.

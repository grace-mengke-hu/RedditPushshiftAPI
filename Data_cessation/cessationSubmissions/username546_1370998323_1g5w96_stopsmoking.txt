Quitting without nicotine withdrawal symtoms. How do you tell yourself not to sneek one once in a while?

I know it sounds crazy, but I can't be the only one. I have smoked off and on since when I was 19(24 now). I started as a stress reliever, then I quit for a number of months after almost a year of smoking. Then I picked it back up before my first deployment(stress again), and when I got to Afghanistan I quit after a month for another 11 months. When I got back I started drinking again and bought a few packs while I was drunk. This lead to a few off and on months of about a pack a week. Heres my issue:

I don't have any withdrawal, so I feel like as long as I give myself long breaks I shouldn't down right quit. I can't be the only one. I keep rationalizing it because I will go all week without one, or more then I'll get a pack for the weekend or whatever. Whenever I stopped smoking I had the wish I had a smoke after dinner blues, but never the short temper/head aches/ or anything else.

I'm turning 25 in a month a just need to make sure I don't make the same mistakes next year

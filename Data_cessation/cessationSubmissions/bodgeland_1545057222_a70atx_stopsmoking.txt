Found out I'm gonna be a dad- Day 1 no cigarettes

Last Sunday I found out I was going to be a dad. I couldn't be more thrilled but I have to stop smoking.

Told myself that after work on Friday I would stop- but I had some cigarettes leftover and ended up smoking 4 on Saturday night. Had the last one in the pack on Sunday morning..

Its now Monday morning and I'm almost at 24 hours. Threw up this morning due to acid reflux (not sure if its related to the quitting but i normally do not get it). I Resisted the urge to buy a pack on the way into work but it is literally all I am thinking about. 

Wish me luck

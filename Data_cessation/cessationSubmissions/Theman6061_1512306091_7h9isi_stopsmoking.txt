Hey guys! Need some advice

I have been using snus. This snus stuff is only sold in sweden and maybe some parts of russia, ive been using it for 4-5 years and i really want to quit, Snus doesnt have "0,8" mg of nicotine in one bag.. its much worse it has 12-24mg. The one i use has 22mg per bag, and now this is my first day without snus so how do you guys keep yourselfs occupied when you have cravings? Playing games or reading a book? Just want some tips because i know the first 5 days are gonna be hell, especially at work

Anyone addicted to spliffs?

Not sure if this should be posted to r/leaves instead, but all I do all day every day is smoke spliffs, something about the weed mixed with tobacco just hits so nice- smoking weed by itself just isn’t the same. However I’m pretty unproductive when I’m just choofin spliffs all day plus the tobaccos, well, we all know how shit it is. I don’t know if it’s just the addiction telling me that MY addiction is super hard to shake 
 cuz it actually does chill me out and help me relax and feel good .... so then I justify relapsing.
Anyway I can’t be the only one addicted to spliffs? It’s been like six or seven years maybe that I’ve been smoking them all day every day - hate smoking ciggies by themselves and don’t really smoke weed by itself either— has anyone else gone through this?

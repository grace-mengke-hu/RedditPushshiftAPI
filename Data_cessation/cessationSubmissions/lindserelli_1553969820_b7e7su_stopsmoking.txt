One week today, and I definitely don’t feel healthier.

...because I came down with Bronchitis the day after I quit. I have never been so sick in my (lucky, healthy) life. I’ve coughed so much I puked a few times. My whole body aches. I had to have a conversation with my doctor about when to go to the ER to help me breathe. All of this has absolutely solidified my commitment to not another puff, ever. Is this what COPD feels like? My god, I want my lungs back. If you are on the fence, I hope my misery inspires you to kick the habit. This is my third go round quitting, but I know it’s my last.  I don’t ever want to live like this. Also I’ve saved almost $40!

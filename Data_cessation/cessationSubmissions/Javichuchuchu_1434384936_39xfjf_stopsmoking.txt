My 2 cents...

First reddit post ever. Big fan though!

It's been two days. I've quit several times, it's not too hard for me to quit (even though I smoke 20-25/day), but this is a problem too: I fall back easily, thinking that I can quit whenever I want. Which, in the end, is obviously not true... Anyway there I go again. My best was 5 months, let's beat it.

I wanted to share a nice idea I use to motivate myself (using it myself now, big cravings). I don't try to picture myself not smoking the rest of my life and get desperate about it. 

I picture myself smoking forever. And concentrate on the bad stuff: outside when raining, after every meal. Nervous and insecure if you don't do this ritual every half an hour. The rest of your life. Doesn't it sound horrible? Addicted, forever. All it takes is 1 cigarrete...

Hope it helps someone!

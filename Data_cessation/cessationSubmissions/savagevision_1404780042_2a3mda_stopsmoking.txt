Day one almost over trying something I found on here this time.

Tried quitting a couple times in the past cold turkey, none of which were successful.  Found this sub and started reading for about a month when I saw one post that basically said: "The patch and exercise."  So thats what I'm putting my faith in this time.  I'm going to post on here when I feel bad too.  Wish me luck

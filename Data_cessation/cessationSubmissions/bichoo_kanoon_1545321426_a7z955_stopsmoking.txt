Once and for all!

I've just finished Allen Carr's book and I'm going to light up my final cigarette, and be done with these turd sewage sticks for good. But this stupid little part of me ( the little monster) tells me I'm just 20 and I can take the gradual process and give myself a little bit more time( I know the book tells there's no correct time, now is the correct time). But Please tell me just about anything to help my rationale faculties take over and use it to tell that monster to shut the fuck up for once and all, and resort to it each time it tries to meddle with me.

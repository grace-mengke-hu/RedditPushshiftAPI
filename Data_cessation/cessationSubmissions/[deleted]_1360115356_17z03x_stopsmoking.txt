1 full day and 6 hours, with sleep ahead.

Well, here I am. Don't even want a smoke. Had a couple breakdowns in the past. I couldn't get passed having a half of a cigarette a day. Now, I just get mad at myself for being so stupid about smoking when I have the urge. That has helped tenfold. 

Thanks everyone else for sharing stories. Gives me something to look forward to!

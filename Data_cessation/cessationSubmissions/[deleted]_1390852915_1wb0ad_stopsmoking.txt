Need help or advice or.....

I want to quit. I hate smoking. But a part of me loves it. 

A buddy bought me a vaporizer. Its a good crutch. Its been three weeks since I bought a pack. Although I bum 3-5 a day from co-workers. I need advice regarding stopping this behavior. I just want to be done with them. Completely. And I want done with the vaporizer.

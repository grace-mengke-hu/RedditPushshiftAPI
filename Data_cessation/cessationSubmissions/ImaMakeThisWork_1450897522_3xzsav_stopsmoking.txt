What do you think of occasional smoking?

I've been smoke free for over a month now. I'm really feeling like smoking a little right now. If I smoked a single cigarette today, would it count as relapsing, if I didn't smoke after that?
Of course, it is hard not to smoke after that 1 cigarette, but if I managed to keep my quit after that.

I'm at my brother's birthday party.

EDIT: ended up smoking. Learned my mistake. Time to try again.

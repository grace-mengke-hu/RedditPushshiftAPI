1 week down

One week without cigarettes after smoking for 10 years and I feel great. 

Wondering if smoking a blunt will cause withdrawal symptoms/cravings because of the nicotine in it? I smoke weed daily and I really feel itâ€™s helping me quit. But does a blunt here and there make quitting harder by reintroducing a small amount of nicotine? 

Also wondering if you all have any tips for a quitter who is dating a heavy smoker?

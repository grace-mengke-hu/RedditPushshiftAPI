Got a month to quit. Taper or other methods?

Going on a two week family holiday in a month, can't smoke while I'm away because none of them know I smoke and are all v anti-smoking.

I smoke rollies, between 5-10 a day. Not too much I know. Would a gradual taper be my best bet?

Only been smoking for 5 months or so... But get the cravings and are increasing quite a lot lately.

Mainly started as a distraction for mental health reasons, as a time out when I needed it and has actually worked really well for that reason.

Any advice? Probably been posted here tons of times, but any help appreciated! Also been keeping it secret from my OH and family who are really anti smoking so advise on keeping it that way, avoiding smells/other signs of smoking would be beneficial too.

Thanks guys and gals x

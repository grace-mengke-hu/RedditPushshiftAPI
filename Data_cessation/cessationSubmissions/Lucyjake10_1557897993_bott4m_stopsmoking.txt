Every morning I say I am going to stop

I wake up every day and say that’s it I am not smoking anymore !! I have been saying it for so long . I have stopped for various amounts of time before ranging from 10 years too a few days . 
I was diagnosed with a brain tumour 2 years ago , had most of it removed but left with a bit due to it being attached to the main artery behind my eye . This should have been enough to make me stop you would think !! 
My biggest problem is the minute I feel stressed it’s the first thing I do light up !! 
Also the other biggest problem I find is my husband and daughter smoke and we sit in garden and chat etc while we smoke . It sounds ridiculous when I say it but I don’t want to miss those times . Yes ridiculous I know !! 
Please any help and advice grateful received , particularly as I know my life could be short with my brain tumour 
Thank you for listening 
I have been reading your posts every day for a couple of years and it’s so inspiring

Relapsed...seriously back to square one. Please don't think you can have just one!

So I was quit for a year and 8 months. Had a stupid fight with my husband and thought "I'll show him!" Went and bought a pack and smoked only one cigarette. Threw the pack away. But I was immediately addicted. I had physical withdrawal. I didn't recognize it at the time and had a day off work so I talked myself into buying another pack just for the sake of having some time to myself....Had one whole cigarette and a couple puffs of another before I threw them all out again. 

Wtf was I doing?!? Talk about a total waste! So here I am, two days later, and I'm almost climbing the walls with anxiety and just all-out physical withdrawal. I can't believe that two cigarettes was all it took. I've quit for long stretches in my life (once for 4 years) and when I've relapsed I always smoked the whole pack so I never realized how addictive these things really are. As much as they helped me to calm down in the moment, it barely lasted a few minutes and the taste is truly nasty. I really don't want to go buy another pack - I cannot be a smoker again for so many reasons. It's just not feasible in my life right now. This addiction sucks! 

Whatever you do, don't think one puff won't hurt. Don't think it will take a whole pack before you have a problem. This stuff is ridiculous! I didn't believe I'd feel this terrible withdrawal from just a couple. I truly thought I had outsmarted it. Don't be dumb like me. Don't have another puff - ever. Unless you want to suffer through withdrawal again.

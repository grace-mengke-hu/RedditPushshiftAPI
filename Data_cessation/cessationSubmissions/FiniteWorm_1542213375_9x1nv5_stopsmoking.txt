Day 1

Actually, the past 3 days have all been Day 1... Maybe posting and asking questions here will help me stick to it.

Today after work, I plan to buy a SHIT ton of snacks and play video games. I figure that when I get a craving, instead of thinking, "I want a cigarette," I'll force myself to think, "I want a treat." We'll see how this strategy plays out.

Usually I'll have a couple beers after work, but--along with having its own set of problems--that always leads to me smoking. So, I've gotta cut the both out completely.

What are your guys' strategies to get through cravings?

Hours away from 1 Week

Days 5&amp;6 have been harder than I thought... I know doing cold turkey is the best way for me.. I just need to stay vigilant... I was a pack &amp; half smoker for essentially 30 years.. I had 2 successful quits .. once for 2 years about 20 years ago &amp; 9 moths about 3 years ago. Cigars got me back to smoking. Agh.. so stupid..
Any how.. now 45 years old.. can’t do it anymore... my biggest problem is projecting about possible  future relapses.  I need to stay in the day but it’s harder than I thought

I didn't smoke for ten days because I'm sick. Where to go from here?

Soooo I had a mean cold with really bad coughs the last few weeks and managed to not smoke since 7/1. 
Now the thing is, how will I keep it up after I'm back to normal? 
I figure the physical side should not be hard, after all I didn't get any nicotine into my system for a while; but cravings will definetly be an issue. 

Did anyone here manage to stop after a forced break?

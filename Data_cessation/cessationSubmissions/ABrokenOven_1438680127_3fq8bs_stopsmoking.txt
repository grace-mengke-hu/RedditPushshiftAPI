So... How do I go about resetting my badge/day counter?

Slipped up yesterday, wasn't a good day for me and I found a box with a couple left in a jacket I hadn't worn in a while. So obviously I did the stupid thing and smoked them.

Here's hoping this time goes better.

Edit; And I just realised I was on the six month mark, great.

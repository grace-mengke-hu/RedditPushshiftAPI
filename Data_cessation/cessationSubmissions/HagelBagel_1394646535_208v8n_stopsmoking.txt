Is a point where you start to feel normal ....

Half way through week 2 and still feeling a bit off ... much better , much fewer and lighter cravings, but still like I haven't got my sea legs yet.  Are these symptoms normal; are they permanent?

- trouble sleeping; smoking dreams
- slight lethargy through day
- feeling of anxiousness, trouble concentrating
- dull, metallic feeling in mouth

Thanks for any insight.

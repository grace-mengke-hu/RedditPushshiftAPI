I quit yesterday.

Yesterday, around noon, I smoked my last cigarette. I've made it 26 hours. Sleeping, once I was able to fall asleep, was the easiest part. Waking up was the hardest. I'm craving one extra hard right now and thought I'd come here for some inspiration. 

I work in a bar on the side, as a bouncer. I was a very social smoker. I might smoke half a pack a day regularly, but at work or when with friends it was nothing to smoke a pack to a pack and a half in 5-8 hours. I think those situations will be the hardest part. I thought about letting myself smoke socially, but limiting myself to only so many cigarettes, or using snus. I'm not sure either of these is a good idea, as I'm not really quitting. 

I do enjoy smoking. There's just something about sitting around with friends with a few beers and some Camel Lights that is just enjoyable to me. I'm sure you guys can relate. Also, 90% of my friends smoke at least socially.

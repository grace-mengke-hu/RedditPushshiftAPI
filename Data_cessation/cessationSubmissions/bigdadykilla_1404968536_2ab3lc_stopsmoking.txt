Does anyone lift weights?

Hey guys,

I'm 23 days no nicotine from over a pack a day for 9 years. I went to the gym last night to lift for the first time in almost a year and I felt like I was lifting on Mt. Everest. I got dizzy towards the end and sucked down a half gallon of water.  I could barely catch my breath and just felt miserable all night after. 

Is this my body or am I just incredibly dehydrated?

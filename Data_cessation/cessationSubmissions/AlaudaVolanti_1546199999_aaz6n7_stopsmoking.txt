20 days in!

Yesterday was weird, got a lot of cravings out of nowhere, a headache and a cough, but I'm so far into this now that I'm going to call myself a non-smoker officially! Very excited, very proud! 

Also, I've heard that people who quit cough up tar, is that everyone after some time or very heavy smokers?

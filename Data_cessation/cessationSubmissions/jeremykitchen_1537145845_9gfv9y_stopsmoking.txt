y'all can do this, I know you can!

I was just perusing reddit and remembered about this sub. When I quit I reset my badge here to keep track of how I was doing, and after a year I unsubbed because I was honestly having craving triggers from seeing posts from here, and after a year I was fairly certain the hard part was behind me.

But let me tell you, it feels REALLY GREAT to see that little \`1940 days\` in my flair. That's a whole hell of a lot of days. That's over $10k worth of cigarettes I haven't smoked.

For those of you trying to quit, hear this: you can do it. I know you can. It's not going to be easy, but it gets easier. That part of your life becomes more distant. You'll soon wonder how you ever smoked in the first place.

I can't give any really concrete advice on quitting smoking other than read this sub. Read this sub religiously. Read everything in the sidebar. Post if you need some encouragement. Post when you're feeling proud of resisting a craving. Post when you're feeling proud of one more day quit. Because you should feel proud. I'm proud of you. I'm cheering for you. And so is everyone on this sub.

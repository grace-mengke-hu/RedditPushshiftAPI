I still don't understand why I smoke

Yesterday I read Allen Carrs book 2 times and smoked my "last" cigarette at 6pm. I woke up at 2am being absolutely disgusted by cigarettes and I thought I finally got it. At around 7am I had another cigarette. While smoking it I realized that it doesn't even relieve my nicotine withdrawal. I'm still nervous, if not even more nervous than before. The more I smoke the more cigarettes I need to even come close to satisfying the withdrawal. Smoking does nothing for me and keeps me stressed 24/7. And even while realizing that, I keep craving cigarettes. I have no rational reason to keep smoking, yet my brain screams "CIGARETTE!". It keeps screaming that before smoking, while smoking and after smoking. The only solution to this is to stop giving nicotine to my body and yet I simply can't stop. What's wrong with me? How do I solve this problem?

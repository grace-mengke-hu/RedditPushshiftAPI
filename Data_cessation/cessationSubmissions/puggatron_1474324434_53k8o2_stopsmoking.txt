First time in weeks my parents aren't home

Now I really want a smoke but I'm trying to resist. What can I do to prevent relapse? I want to go outside like I used to, sit in a lawn chair behind the garage and smoke, but I am still trying to quit, help please

Edit: thanks guys, I didn't smoke today:) I played Xbox and had frozen pizza so it was all good

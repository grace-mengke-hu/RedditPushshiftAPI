Headaches around 30 days?

I dont ever get headaches, not ever, and today I have the slightest headache. It's not constant, it only hurts when I cough or laugh. Maybe it's because I got crappie sleep last night idk... on another note my sleep completely flopped on me. Before I quit it would take me about an hour or more to fall asleep.... now I fall asleep in minutes but wake up about 4 hours after I fall asleep and then wake up every hour after that till I just get up. Also start having vivid dreams after i go back to sleep. Shits creeping me out. Anyone else have this happen to them?

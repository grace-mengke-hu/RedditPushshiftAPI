wtf... WHY do I find quitting smoking super easy this time?

I mean, I am on my 3rd day of not smoking and find it so easy. I know my triggers and can get in front of them and not really care. I mean, wtf? Thing is, day 3 is sometimes said to be one of the hardest and I had NO craving today, really. wtf...

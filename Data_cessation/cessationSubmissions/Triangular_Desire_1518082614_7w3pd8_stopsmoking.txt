Well I did it!!!!

I caved to the demon. My brother killed himself last friday and I am broken. I started with one and then 2. Bought a pack. Smoked one and threw them out. Bought another pack a few hours later. Had 2 and angrily stomped on them.  I bought a blu and chain vaped it gone in under 36 hours. Im a smoker again. I thought I had won. I kept seeing all the 4-6 month relapse posts the last 6 months claiming confidently â€˜not me! Not one puff! Never again. Ive never felt so defeated in my entire life.

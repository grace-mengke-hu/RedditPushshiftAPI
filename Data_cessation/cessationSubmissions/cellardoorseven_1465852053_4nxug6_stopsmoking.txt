No cigs for over a week and feel great, hoping my love of social cannabis use doesn't make me relapse...

I'm 20 years old and smoked pretty consistently from the age of 17. I would generally smoke half a pack a day, sometimes less or more depending on the stress happening in my life. I've tried to quit at least 10 times and now have done so successfully. I tried cold turkey, nicotine gum, vaping, cutting back, none of it worked. I didn't think that maybe cigarettes were contributing to my stress but now I'm really glad to be free of the illusion that cigarettes benefit you in any way. What helped me was waking up one day hacking my lungs out and really realizing that I was paying a lot of money to essentially kill myself. I couldn't participate in aerobic activities or go up a flight of stairs without wheezing and coughing. My doctor diagnosed me with asthma and gave me an inhaler, when in reality it was just my years of smoking already catching up with me. I realized I had to stop now or it was just going to progress and get worse. I wanted my lungs back. So I read EasyWay by Allen Carr and went cold turkey again, this time it worked.

I still, however, use recreational drugs in moderation, mainly cannabis. I don't really have a problem with it as the smoke is nowhere near as toxic as tobacco smoke, it's not anywhere near as addictive as nicotine, and Whenever I'm with my friends, it seems a lot of them prefer to smoke blunts. The other day I was in a situation where my friends were smoking and had rolled a blunt, which uses the outer tobacco leaf shell of a cigarillo as a container for the weed. I hit it, even knowing that it would just reintroduce nicotine in my system which is something I'm trying to avoid.

Should I abstain from smoking blunts in social situations because I've quit nicotine? Could this create the potential for me to relapse and pick up smoking cigarettes again even though I'm fully in the mindset of having quit cigarettes?

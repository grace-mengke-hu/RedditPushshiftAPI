ALMOST A YEAR?!?!?!

I'm almost at a year! I have to thank this subreddit for its support and recommendations. Allen Carr's Easy Way worked so well for me, haven't had a serious craving since I read it, and I first heard about it from this subreddit. Thank you so much to everyone who contributes to this subreddit, for supporting each other and always showing positivity any time I read through the posts. I am so excited to pass a year and I can not believe how it feels so much longer than that already!! Stay strong, to everyone on here who is ready to quit or who has already, you're fcking awesome and you got this. Nicotine's got NOTHING on us!

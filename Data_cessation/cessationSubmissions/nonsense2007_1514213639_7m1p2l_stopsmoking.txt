Today is day zero.

Here is every reason I can think of why I just smoked my last cigarette. 

* The best Christmas gift I can give to the people who love me is not having to mourn me. 
* I'm 34. I need to do this before I have worse irreparable changes to my body.  
* Smoking isn't fun anymore. 
* I'm too broke to smoke. I'd rather buy so many other things. 
* My parents both died of cancer before they were 60. I don't want that, and I know they wouldn't want me to still be smoking either. 
* I want my house to smell better.
* I want my fingers to be less yellow. 
* I want my teeth to look better. 
* I'm actively harming myself by continuing to smoke even when I'm coughing a lot. 
* Nicotine worsens the chronic illness I have. Why am I working to improve my health while simultaneously ruining it?
* I can name at least six people who'd be absolutely over the moon if I quit smoking. 
* I too would be ridiculously proud of myself for quitting smoking. 
* I'm trying to change a lot about my life in the next 3-6 months. Having an extra $14 a day would make that A LOT easier. 
* I've started smoking in bed lately and that's always been a hard limit for me. That's really effin' gross. 
* I want to be able to taste things better. 
* Some of the weakest-willed people I know have quit smoking. I'm better than that. 
* I want better for myself. This is one big way to be that. 
* I want to accomplish something I can be really proud of. 
* I really hate coughing. 
* I don't like driving in the snow, but I end up having to when I run out of cigarettes. 
* I hate being angry when I have no cigarettes.

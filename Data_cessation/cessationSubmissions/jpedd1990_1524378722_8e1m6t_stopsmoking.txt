I know its stupid.

I've got a drinking problem and I like to smoke when I drink. Been drinking tonight and have been staring at my pack of smokes for about an hour. Bought a vaporizer Friday and it does the trick. I'll light up 1 tonight just because I want to finish the 4 I have left. 

Just felt like posting this. Idk if its good or bad. If bad, sorry.

P.S. I'm working on both my problems by "quitting" smoking and weening myself off beer.

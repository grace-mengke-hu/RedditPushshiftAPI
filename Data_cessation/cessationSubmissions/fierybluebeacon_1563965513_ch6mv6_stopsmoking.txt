I quit smoking over a year ago, but I'm slipping again and could really use some support

I quit cold turkey, and in the past year I've only had a handful of cigarettes during difficult times and drunk nights, but I recently have started having a few a week, and the amount is only increasing. I've moved to a new city where there's lots of smokers, and moved in with a partner who smokes, not to mention going through a few difficult things that have made me crave them. I don't want to build up those habits again because I remember how hard it was to break them the first time round. Any supportive words or advice would be greatly appreciated!

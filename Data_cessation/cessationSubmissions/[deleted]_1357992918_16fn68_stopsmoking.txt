10 days in the world of non smokers now!

I'm ten days in now, and I'm still hanging in there. I haven't even come close to smoking. I know the Chantix is a big part of why I've managed to avoid a lot of the misery, and I'm SO grateful for it! I'm also relieved that the crazy dreams have been mostly highly entertaining. I hope everyone else out there quitting is doing well, we can do this!!

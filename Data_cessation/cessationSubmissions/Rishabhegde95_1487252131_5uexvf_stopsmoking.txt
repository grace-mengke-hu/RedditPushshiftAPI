Starting again

I had quit for 100 days then things got messed up and I started smoking again , it's been over a month since I started 
and then I heard my relative got cancer inspite not drinking nor smoking then i realised that I am taking my life for granted  and I want to start the process.
Hopefully this time I quit for good and am really thankful for the this community for helping me last time.

Fuck cigarettes.

Here we go

I’ve been tobacco free for just over nine months. I got sick of smoking one day and threw away my cigarettes and bought a Juul. I just ran out of the last pod I had and threw the whole thing in the trash. We just found out my wife is pregnant and she quit smoking four days ago so I feel like I need to as well. I had been thinking about quitting nicotine altogether anyways, so seems perfect. Wish me luck! I’m sure I’ll be around here for a little while as it gets difficult.

Ideas to eliminate the occasional binge smoking???

I quit smoking in 2011 for the first time after 20 years of smoking and my quit lasted 4 years. Relapsed last december for 4 months and then quit again 3 months back.

However, I binge smoked last night during a night out. Have done this before. I dont seem to crave on subsequent days when I smoke with alcohol. I can go without a smoke or craving as long as I dont drink.

Anyone been through this? I want to stop even the occassional smoke but to do that I need to quit drinking altogether and I dont think I am ready to do that yet. 

How do I stop this occasional binge so the neural pathways can heal more fully? Any ideas?

Thanks guys...

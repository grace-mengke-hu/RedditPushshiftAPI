After a few failed attempts i'm now 9 days 10 hours smoke free!!!

So it was hard for me to quit cold turkey i tried a few times and didnt make it past day 4 sometimes not even a day at all. i am now using the patch nicoderm cq and its helping me alot stay away from cigs. i dont keep them on when im about to go to bed so ive been sleeping very well until yesterday. I had a dream that i was smoking and it felt so real i woke up in the middle of the night looking around the house to see how real it was or if i even did smoke, is this normal?
Also if your having a hard time quitting try the patches, i was thinking of stopping the patches early but decided to go through the whole NRT

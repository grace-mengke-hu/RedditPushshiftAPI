Hair Loss with Smoking?

Hi guys/girls. I am 27, I've never smoked in my life until I started my PhD. It has been around two years since I started my PhD and I only smoked while out drinking, that would be one a month. I had a candidacy exam last month, and that meant that I was very stressed, couldn't sleep, and I turn to cigarettes as some means to 1) procrastinate and 2) release stress (which is a bullshit reason I know). However, I have only actually smoked since January, that would mean maybe 1 pack every 2 days or so. Probably a 1.5months ago I noticed that my hair was thinning, but it wasn't just in "getting old" thinning, but all over, just my hair wasn't thick anymore. I went to the doctor, and they said that it seems that my stressful lifestyle along with heavy smoking would make my body react like this. I am currently craving a pack that is right next to me, and today I bought nicotine gum for the first time. I am mostly stopping out of vanity, since my hair keeps getting thinner. Has anyone else been in this position? How do you think I should approach this?

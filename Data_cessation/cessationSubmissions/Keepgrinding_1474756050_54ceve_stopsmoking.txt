Stop putting your head in the sand

Yeah I know you are hurting. Mental and physical problems that nobody understands.. Oh poor you. So you deserve a cigarette and yeah your life is so hard and.... 

F U C K that shit. Cancer doesn't give a shit about your excuses. It might come around at 25, 36, heck maybe you'll be lucky and the cigs will kill you at 90. One thing is for sure they will make your life shittier. Let it go, or life will let go of cigs for you. Either through disease or worse death. 

Let go of useless attachments like cigs no matter what situation. 

Sincerely yours 
with tough love,

2 weeks ... but not getting much positive effects?

Hi,

I quit 2 weeks ago ... and I expected some kind of (gradual) energy boost but ... I'm experiencing the exact opposite. My work-productivity & motivation are down A LOT and I don't feel more energized at all.Which is a little curious as I now eat double of what I used to eat.

I don't feel better ... far from it really. I eat a lot more, which is good cause i'm a skinny dude, who didn't eat enough but this also doesn't seem to put more energy into my body. 

I realize I have to stay quit but I guess I expected it to be more rewarding on a physical level.

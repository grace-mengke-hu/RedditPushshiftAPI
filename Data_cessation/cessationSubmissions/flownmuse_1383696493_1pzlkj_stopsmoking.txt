Increased Spice Sensitivity?

OK, so it's my fourth day smoke free. After work I picked up some Buffalo Wild Wings (Asian Zing!) to take home for dinner... the same spice level that I usually get, but tonight I can barely handle them! Usually they give me a nice warm glow, but right now I'm drinking a glass of milk to help dial things down a bit. Is this common?

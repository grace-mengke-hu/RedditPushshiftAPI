Resetting my badge after 33 days

I am angry at myself,after 33 days I went to a party and after a few beers i gave in.The most frustrating thing is that i have gave in before I have touched those things,I knew i was going to smoke after the second beer and I staid at the party.
I feel strange and a ashamed,but I am not going to quit quitting!
So...here I go again!
I just needed to vent,thanks for reading.

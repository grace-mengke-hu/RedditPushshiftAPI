Patiently waiting for my app to hit 100.00 saved. ;)

I LOVE the "quit it" app for iOS. I check it every single day to see where I am at for savings and how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, and of course, how many days, hours and minutes I've been clean.

I'm super excited because this morning I woke up and realized I'm on the brink of saving 100.00!! 

This quit hasn't been much work, to be honest. It's been easy breezy... But it still takes self control to keep from buying them when I pop into 7-11 and things like that. 

Anywho, I just wanted to share. Thanks you guys. This sub has helped me feel like I'm part of something phenomenal and that I have people in this journey with me. 

Good luck and stay strong!!

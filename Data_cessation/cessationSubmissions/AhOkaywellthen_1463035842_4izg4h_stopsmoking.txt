Alright then!

It annoys me that I smoke. Last cigarette was yesterday night right before going to sleep. I just woke up. Normally I would make a coffee, and then immediately fall back in to the rhythm of lighting these bastards every hour or so.

I can't really find a nice method to make me stop smoking which I believe in.

last time I tried to stop I had a friend slap me literally in the face every time I smoke. It worked for a while, then I just started not telling him when I did smoke. It was worth a try.. Haha, but feels a bit stupid to write that down now. Anyway!

Now I just do it.

Edit: smoker for 16 years

Day 2 and this sucks.

Feeling anxious, agitated, and cigarettes are all I can think about. I hope this gets easier. I'm tired of depending on cigarettes to function. I just have to keep telling myself that all the justifications I keep thinking of for reasons to smoke, are just my body and mind withdrawing from nicotine.

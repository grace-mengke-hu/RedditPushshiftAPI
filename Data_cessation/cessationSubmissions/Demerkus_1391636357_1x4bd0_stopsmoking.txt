3 days in, all going good so far.

I know this probably seems like nothing to you guys, but it's been exactly 3 days since I last lit up and it's only getting better, being able to taste and smell things far better than before!

I haven't brutally murdered anyone for a pack yet and I'm not even falling for the temptation when I'm walking past smokers in work, or from the smell left by my Mum's partner in the kitchen as he smokes when he's alone.

I really hope I can keep this up and not give in to the short moments where I can hear my mind muttering to go and buy some.

A little back-story and a thanks.

I have tried to quit smoking countless times, always to no avail. As of late it was really starting to get to me. I was just feeling really smelly, tired, and my throat always seemed a little irritated. It was getting really old. So, on January 6th I smoked one last cigarette and pitched my pack.
It has been easy in some ways, and hard in others. Honestly, I only really crave one after I eat or when I'm with my co-workers. I work for a cleaning company, and the women I drive from location to location with are heavy smokers. It's kinda like a gas chamber in the vehicle. I feel as though they smoke so much it almost kind of negates that I've quit. Really hate that. 
At any rate, being able to come on here and read all of your posts has TREMENDOUSLY helped me. You're all an inspiration to me. I feel as though I'm not so alone in this endeavor with all of you here to help me out with your words of wisdom. Thank you a million times and good luck to you all!

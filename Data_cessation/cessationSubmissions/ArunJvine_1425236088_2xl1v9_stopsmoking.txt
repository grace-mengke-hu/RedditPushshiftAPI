Four days of being a NON SMOKER!!

I have been smoking for the past 4 1/2 years. I smoke under the following scenarios, 
1. After a good meal
2. Right After work (work not stressful though) 
3. With alcohol (occasionally) 
4. with certain smoke buddies 
5. When I have nothing to do. 

I usually smoke 2/3 cig per day and today (fourth day of the cessation),  I ve some moderate cravings, but I avoided myself.  
I use gum,  when I have this cravings. 
Hope i can quit all together.  Any suggestions/ advice would be deeply appreciated.  Thank you in advance!!

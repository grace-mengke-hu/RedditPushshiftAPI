Here we go

I'm sure this sub gets a lot of these posts but I have to put it out there that today is my first day and I don't want to tell friends/family until I'm at least a few days in. A week ago I quit smoking weed (was an all day smoker and gave up a lot of good times and friends because I would rather stay home and get high.) Last Thursday I accepted my first adult job offer which I start at tomorrow. And today I gave up cigarettes. I'm taking control of my life and it feels pretty good.

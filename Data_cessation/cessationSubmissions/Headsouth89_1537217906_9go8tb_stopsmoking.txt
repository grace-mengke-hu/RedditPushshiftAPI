On day 3 after a little hiccup

I’m on day 16 of taking Champex and I was a smoker for about 15 years, started at school when I was 13 and now I’m 28. 

I decided to stop smoking because I have just moved in to my own flat with my bf and my 9 year old. I wouldn’t be able to smoke in the flat and I’m too lazy to walk down 2 flights of stairs to go for a fag in the cold and the rain. Moving out on your own is a terrifying feeling and it’s no 1 on the most stressed time in my life ever.  The pennies saved from quitting will help the family in the long run too and my daughter will like giving me cuddles and kisses now because I don’t smell ☺️

The first week on Champex was the worst, I was an emotional wreck, couldn’t stop crying, was cranky, and most of all proper struggled with sleep (I’m not a great sleeper anyway). At my 3rd appointment at the stop smoking clinic I just went in and cried at the poor lady. It made me feel so much better. If anyone is struggling on Champex make sure that you keep to your appointments, that’s what these guys are trained for, to listen to us and support us. 

I went out on Friday night, child free and all that jazz, with some work colleagues, and made the mistake of buying some fags after a few drinks. I smoked the whole 20 pack. It made me feel gross, like when I woke up in the morning with the dry mouth and ashy taste. I’m feeling good now, like I know this is what I need to do and I’m never going to have a fag ever again! 

I feel like I’ve just jabbered on but it’s keeping my hands busy haha.

Does anyone else not enjoy drinking as much anymore?

I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but I definitely don't enjoy it as much anymore now that I don't smoke. There was something about enjoying a great beer (or 5) and a cig. But on the bright side I've had much less hangovers, and you can't be mad at that

8 months

So it's been 8 months since i had my last cig.  I miss smoking, and I always will, but only because of nostalgia.  I dont need to do it, I dont want to do it, but i still miss it.  I've moved on in my life past it, and I dont ever want to go back.  Hell, the only reason that I'm still posting here is because I want to make sure it sticks.  I've quit for a year before and relapsed, so I am taking no chances.  You all here have been great inspiration for me, and I wanted to thank you for that.

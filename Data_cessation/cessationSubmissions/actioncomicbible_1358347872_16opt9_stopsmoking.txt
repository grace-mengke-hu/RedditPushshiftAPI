So close to the top but I failed...

Went 317 days. Smoked at a party. Nothing else much to say besides I am a huge piece of shit.


Don't let this happen to you guys. **DON'T**. It has ruined this whole week for me and destroyed my confidence in myself. It's a really horrible feeling. 



Update: thank you all for your encouraging words. I may be overreacting and being too hard on myself but that feeling of pride when someone offers you one and you say, "No thanks, I don't smoke." is just...wonderful. I feel like I let myself down over the weekend. Im going to be way better in the future. 365 coming up!

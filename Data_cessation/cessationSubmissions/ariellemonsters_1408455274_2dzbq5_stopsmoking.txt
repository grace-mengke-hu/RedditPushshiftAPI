Quit with my SO, can't stop bickering.

Hi all,

My boyfriend and I quit smoking together only a week and a half ago. This coming Friday will be two weeks, no durries. He smoked for 9 years and I did for 5.

I'm feeling good about quitting and we know that we're going to be healthier (and richer!!) for it, but WE CANNOT STOP FIGHTING. I am so, SO irritable, and he is so, SO sensitive. And everything he is doing is annoying me. And every time I get annoyed at him, he turns on the water works and weeps like a tiny baby, which is extremely out of character for him (kind of hilarious though, but mostly just irritating).

I know it will fade with time, but how long will it take?! It's putting a bit of a strain on our relationship - I know we won't break up over it, but it is definitely tarnishing what once was flawless.

If you guys have any tips on how we can work through the stages of withdrawal together and motivate each other to be happier and healthier, please let me know! Otherwise, we are very proud of our self control :)


Thanks everybody - we are proud of you all too!

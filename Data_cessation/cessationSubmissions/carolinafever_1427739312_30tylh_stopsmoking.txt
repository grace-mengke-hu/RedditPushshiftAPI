Signed up for 10k in a month. No choice but to quit.

I forced myself to sign up for a 10k and it requires me to stay quit for completion. I have quit numerous times before but each time picking up "just one for cig" did not have any consequences. But this time, I have a consequence. 

Hopefully, this will be different from the 1,800 times before I tried to quit.

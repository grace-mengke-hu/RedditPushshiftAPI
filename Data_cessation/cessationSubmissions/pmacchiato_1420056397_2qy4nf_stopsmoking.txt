Couple Days In (again), the struggle is real

My cravings get strong whenever I'm talking to somebody on the phone, which I do a fair amount since I live away from family/friends now. Yesterday while I was talking to a friend, I drove to three gas stations and parked each time, resisting the urge to go inside and buy a pack. I look forward to the day that I can talk on the phone without that urge, but I can't keep going back to smoking if I want to ever rid of it. This sucks. Happy new year people. Good luck and stay strong.

Alan Carr's easy way helps

Pack a day smoker for 17 years. Now clean for 3 weeks, not even a puff and no desire either. Have unsuccessfully quit earlier too. Somethings different which I tried this time and feel that it helped was from Alan Carr's book the easy way to quit smoking. Instead of thinking of yourself as a victim who is missing out on something great think of yourself as a proud intelligent person who's successfully given up a stupid habit. When you see someone else smoke instead of feeling sad feel happy that you have been able to accomplish something that they haven't been able to. Please understand that this is conscious conditioning of the mind. Really helped me get over the initial days. After that anyways the improvements you see in your health will kill any urges to get back into the cycle. Remember that even if you take one more puff everything goes down the drain.

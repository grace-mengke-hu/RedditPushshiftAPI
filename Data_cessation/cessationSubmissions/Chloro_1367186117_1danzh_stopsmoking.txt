New place, new habits. I'm done with those death sticks.

I just moved in to my new place today and I got a week off work. I figure it's a great time to quit and get through the withdrawal. The only thing I liked about cigarettes was the stress relief, I didn't even like inhaling the stuff. It was destroying my health and my wallet.

So here's my plan. For the next few days I'll keep my mind busy by setting up the new place. I'll drink a lot of water, and if I get an urge I can play video games or take a walk around the new neighborhood. I'll visualize my cravings as an ugly rat-like creature inside my head that keeps begging for nicotine. But I'll kill that parasite by starving it. The days of self destruction are over. 

Wish me luck.

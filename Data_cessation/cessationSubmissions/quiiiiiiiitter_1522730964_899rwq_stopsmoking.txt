[Update] Chantix and quitting?

Hi folks— thought I’d provide an update... I just completed by third day of not taking Chantix/ninth day not smoking. That stuff (Chantix) was messing with my head so I decided (after discussing with my doctor) to stop the medication &amp; go cold turkey instead. Chantix helped me through the first week, when my triggers were really strong. This week (I’m currently smoke-free 9 days) I’m feeling capable of doing this on my own, but aware of how hard it’s going to be. 

I still have difficulties sleeping, vivid dreams, and some depression &amp; anxiety. These have all improved, though, since I stopped taking Chantix. Those little pills are really strong! I support anyone who’s taking them to confide in friends, professionals, and family, because I didn’t realize how strong of an affect it’d have on me! 

Thanks for the support around here. I love reading everyone’s experiences. Good luck, fellow non-smokers!

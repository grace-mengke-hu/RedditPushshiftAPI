Depression after quitting?

I’m ashamed to admit I just relapsed after two days of going cold turkey after reading Allen Carr’s book.

Call it a placebo if you will but I feel like it helped me. I hardly even wanted to smoke.
However, by the first night, all I felt like doing was crawl into a ball, fall asleep and never wake up again.

I read somewhere that nicotine pangs can temporarily cause low serotonin.

Has anyone been through this sort of problem? How long does this last?

I still intend to try and quit smoking again soon.

2 weeks!

This is when I would normally fail. But I have been just staying positive.  Also the people I live with are slowing down and trying to quit! I am happy that people around me are trying to be healthy.  Also had my first class of brkrim yoga last night. It was intense but it was great feeling to finish. I could have done better but baby steps. I only get to go once a week but at least it is something! If I just keep this positivity then I know I will quit for good. But I still have cravings, actually everyday i still want ro smoke. I just don't give in. It is hard but it is worth it.

shit I thought i was done with the hard part.

I'm not sure how many days it has been, probably 10 I guess since I've left smoking (on mobile app, can't see badge)

last few days have been breeze wheeew
but today was such a screwed up day. 

and I think depression hit me yday?
is that normal? 
my head is clear but I feel a bit gloomy and alone in the world kind of shiz, tho weird thing is that din really made me wanna have a cig.... it that normal?

my cravings today were highly intense and lasted longer but I din smoke  :D

I have gone from craving cigs more than 5 times an Hr to around 5 cravings in a day and that feels Ô∏èepic!!! 

this place is such an epic place!!

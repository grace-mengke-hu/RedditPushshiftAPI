are e-cigarettes good to stop smoking?

I wanted to know if e-cigarettes are good to help me stop smoking.  
well, i have tried multiple times to stop smoking but here's why i couldn't, i'm really passionate about Web Development and i spend my day learning and doing projects. When i try to stop smoking i lose my focus on what i'm learning/coding from all the cravings -i need to finish things so i can land my dream job- so i'd go out buy a pack to stop the cravings and focus on my learning/coding. I thought the other day that if i used an e-cigarette it would probably aid in the process of reducing my smoking without actually losing focus until i stop or maybe it'll be a healthier solution.

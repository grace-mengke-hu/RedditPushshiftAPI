Quit after 15 years after seeing a hypnotist.

My pack+ per day smoking turned into vaping constantly throughout the day. Vaping is just as bad, maybe worse...and undeniably harder to stop. Whenever I'd try, I'd go back to smoking cigarettes.

I tried cold turkey, nicotine gum, less intense ejuice, etc...nothing worked for long. I never thought I could quit, so I took a shot in the dark and sought the help of a hypnotist. Surprisingly, it worked and I can even be around my smoking friends...even a smoking patio during a night out at a local pub, and still there's no desire.

I can go on and on, but before this becomes a huge wall of text, I'm happy to answer any questions if you're wondering about hypnosis to quit.

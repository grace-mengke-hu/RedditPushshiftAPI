Trying again

So I made the biggest mistake by having that "one cigarette" 2 .5 months ago and now im back to square one, lying and sneaking around ruining all the progress I made over the 6 month I quit. im hoping posting here will give me the motivation to quit which im struggling to find again. Being an addict sucks, why do we return to the shit when we have experienced how good life can be!

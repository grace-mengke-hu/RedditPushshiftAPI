Sinus infection

Hey I'm at three weeks and change. I've been sick which sucks but on the bright side when I wake up in the morning lately my throaght feels as though I've chain smoked two packs the previous evening. So that helps me to remember why I quit. It would be nice if I was not sick though. ...The cravings I used to feel in the morning are no longer existent but my bowels are still strange so I might need to change my diet a bit or something of that nature. In addition to qutiing the tobacky I'm buying a house. (We just closed today!) and also I just switched to day shift from nightshift.   Things are changing in my life and that's good and exciting. Also a little unreal at times.. I really appreciate this sub reddit and all guys and gals posting on it. You lift me up and also guide me when I have deep anger or the fear.  Anyway that's all for now. Good luck to all of you fellow quitters. I'm sending good vibes your way.

Quitting. Again.

Been putting this off for a while now. Intended to stop in February, but last night was when I decided to really commit to this. I quit back in 2012 for about six months and it felt great. Don't remember how I got back on it but 2013 was spent as a full time smoker. 

13 hours since my last cigarette and I'm feeling good about everything right now but I've done this before and I know the battle will be tough. I'm looking forward to seeing the numbers on my badge grow.

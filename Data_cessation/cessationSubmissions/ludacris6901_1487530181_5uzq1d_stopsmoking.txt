Ugh i caved in after 34 days cold turkey

I was doing so good until about a week ago and ive had this little voice in my head to start smoking again. Its been unrelenting and so annoying. I finally caved last night after drinking some beers. The weather was nice all weekend and all i wanted to do was sit in my rocking chair outside like the good old days and smoke.  And thats exactly what i did. I dont know why i wanted to so bad but just did it so that the stupid voice in my head would finally just leave me alone. Going to smoke today, then soak whatever is left in water and start day 1 over again tomorrow.  

Im not really upset with myself. I learned something new that i will be able to overcome next time. Cant beat myself up about it too bad. Just wanted to share to get it off my chest.

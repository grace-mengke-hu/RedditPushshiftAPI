30 days in and having some cravings

I quit a month ago with the help of an e-cigarette. I started out with 12mg liquid and went down slowly to 0mg. That was yesterday where I reached 0mg. Now I'm starting to get stronger and stronger cravings. The e-cigarette doesn't give me that feeling of sweet relief anymore and honestly it feels silly to "smoke" something with 0mg nicotine. But I'm going to keep it up for a few weeks in hopes that it will get better. Eventually I want to put down the e-cigarette too. Wish me luck.

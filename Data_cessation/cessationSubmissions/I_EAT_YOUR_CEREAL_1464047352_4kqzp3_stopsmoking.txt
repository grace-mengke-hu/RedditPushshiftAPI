Day 1 here we go!

I've been smoking for 6 years and I'm trying to change my life. I've been a lazy person and am now picking up sports and going to the gym. After a couple months I can barely run 5km straight and who am I kidding, it's the smoking.

It's going to be a tough one. I don't think that I'm addicted to smoking as I don't smoke or feel the need to smoke when I go home (to my parents), it's going to be hard because of the culture I live in and my anxiety. Whenever I'm in a stressful or awkward situation smoking gives me something to do. Living in China where you can smoke literally in the hospital lobbies is not going to be easy, it's just part of the culture and *all* men smoke.

At the end of the day my parents have never been smokers and they don't know I smoke. I cannot imagine how they would feel if one day I was in hospital in cancer.

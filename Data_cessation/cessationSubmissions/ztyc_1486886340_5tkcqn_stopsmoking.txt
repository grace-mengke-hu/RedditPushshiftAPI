First time trying to quit, any advice would be appreciated!

  Hi I stumbled upon this sub a few days back and have really been inspired by some of your testimonies and journeys. 

A little info about myself, I started smoking a few years back when I sort of mixed with the wrong crowd and have been hooked ever since. Used to smoke a pack a day but now probably about three a week. I'm currently in the military and there's occasionally a few days in the base where we have a lot of free time and I find myself smoking the most during then. Smoke quite a lot during the weekends too as I occasionally go partying and those drunk cravings are really hard to beat.

Been trying to quit a few times now but Those haven't been very serious tries imo. I would say I'll want to quit and maybe try some supplements but go back to smoking a few days later. Recently however, many things have prompted me to start taking quitting seriously, mainly financial reasons as I have to save for my studies later on but definitely because of other factors as well such as family and health.

I used to not feel anything when buying a pack but recently I've felt a sense of disgust when I purchase my weekly three packs because I realise I'm spending most of my pay on cigs... so I've decided this time that I'm really going to try my best to quit.

I'm just wondering if any of you would have some good advice such as would going in cold turkey be better or maybe a gradual decrease etc?? And a Friend of mine who knew I was planning to quit got me a book called "the easy way to quit smoking" by Alan Carr and was wondering if the book helped any of you? 

Thanks!

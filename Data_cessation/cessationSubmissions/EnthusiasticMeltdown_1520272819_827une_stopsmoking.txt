Started smoking again after two months of being smoke-free. Feel disappoined.

So I was trying to get my life back on track lately and decided that quitting smoking was a good thing to start with. I tried using Allen Carr's method but I failed. But I managed to quit using cytisine tablets (similiar to varenicline / chantix - popular here in Eastern Europe). While it was nowhere near as tough as quitting cold turkey - it resulted in a fair deal of suffering on its own.

Then a few bad things happened - my life became screwed on several levels. Dropped out from the university, became socially isolated, learned about my medical condition and had a hard time getting over a breakup. I felt (and still feel) very depressed and anxious. I resorted to abusing alcohol and amphetamines as a result. And while non-sober and full of negative emotions I started smoking again a few days ago.

I simply don't care about cancer now. I don't care about wasting money. I could stop smoking now and suffer mild withdrawal for a very short time but I don't want to. Somehow nicotine helps me cope with all that in a primitive self-destructing way (as some sort of mild self-harm coping mechanism).

But I feel like shit for failing again. I always fail to keep promises I made to myself. Not only in case of smoking but in all other life's matters as well. Seriously I think I need to work on other life's issues to get back on track and then will be the time when I will be able to quit nicotine for good. I think I need help with my mental problems first.

I'm thinking about switching to vaping soon - I will be able to maintain my smoking habit and ingest nicotine without all those negative effects from actual smoking. Seems like a good idea? I know it looks like rationalizing and making excuses. It feels shitty too. Be honest about your opinions.

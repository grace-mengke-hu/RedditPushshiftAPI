Something to consider about where your cigarette money is going (think about this before you relapse)

Phillip Morris isnt run by good people - they dont use your money to  fund medical research or help homeless veterans. They use it for more advertising to lure in children, many of whom will die from their products.  

Read that again. You pay a company money to make you feel misreble and ultimately kill you, and they spend that money on advertising to lure in more children to pay for their own slow painful deaths, and the cycle repeats. 

The only way for this cycle to break is if we all quit.

The only way to quit is to not smoke a single cigarette ever again.

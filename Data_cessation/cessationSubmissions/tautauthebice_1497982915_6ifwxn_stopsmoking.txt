I used to count people who never had the misfortune of being addicted extremely lucky. But after wrestling with quitting for a year i have a new understanding

I started my journey a year ago. At first i made myself believe i could do 1 a week. and pretty much managed it as a social thing for a few months. The initial quit was extremely hard. 

But im glad that after 6 months of that im now in the mindset of actually disliking cigs. I now know that there are zero benefits to smoking. They dont do us any favours. they only take from us and leave us worse than we were before. there is no stress relieve because the nicotine addiction made us stressed and uneasy to begin with. Its so great to not feel shitty every few hours without a cig and having every activity be ruined because the thought and worry about when the next cig is gonna come is more important than anything else.

The peace and serenity you get when you dont give a tiny rat's ass about cigs is far more stress relieving and calming than a cigarette could ever be. They made us stressed in the first place.

I used to think it would never happen for me because i always saw myself as that guy with a cig. whenever im faced with a difficult task, as long as ive got the cig its all fine. traffic jams were bearable. boring hangout. cigs were just convenience. 

But probably the biggest reason ill never go back to cigs is because after the nicotine addiction died, i realized that cigarettes actually dont taste good. theyre tolerable. i swear if it wasnt for the daemon that forces you to smoke i bet the majority of the human race would not smoke. its just too much work. the ash gets everywhere. your mouth tastes and feels like shit. u smell like shit. and its expensive. its so nice to be able to treat myself with anything i want every once in a while. want a stress relief? go on a vacation. free of charge. courtesy of the death sticks themselves.

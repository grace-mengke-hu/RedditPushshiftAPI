1,5 of not smoking- sudden cravings

I’m actually just looking for a little kick in the butt.
I haven’t smoked for a year and a half after smoking since I was a teenager- that was more than 15 years of on and off smoking. I was sure I was safe, even started to have a bit of a snooty attitude towards smokers- and now, bam, I have huge cravings. A little voice tells me “won’t it be nice to have one, just one... every now and then”.
Oh man, I’m not fine with that. I would really appreciate some wise words as it feels I’m in a bit of trouble and really do not want to pick up the first smoke!

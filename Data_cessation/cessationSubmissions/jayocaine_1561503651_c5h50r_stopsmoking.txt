Second attempt.

I read allan carr's easy way to quit smoking the first time around and it was so easy to quit, I went 3 months (longest I went before that was 8 hours). Then I messed up, got drunk with an old pal and had a puff. So I want to quit again, but I heard Easy way doesn't "work" a second time? How the hell is that possible, that's silly makes it sound like some hypnotism mumbo jumbo, which it clearly isn't. I likely just need a reminder, but I could be wrong.  


Who here has read Easy Way a second time around?

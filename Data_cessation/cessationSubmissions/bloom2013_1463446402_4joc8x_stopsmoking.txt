First social gathering.. Any last minute tips?

I wanted to wait a bit before being around all my smoker friends and booze .. But I couldn't get out of this thing tonight. I'm trying to see it as better now than later scenario.. Like I might as well deal with all these triggers now, while my guard is up and my resolve is strong.
I'll be careful with drinking. Any other tips or words of encouragement will be welcome cause I'm on my way there and I'm really nervous.

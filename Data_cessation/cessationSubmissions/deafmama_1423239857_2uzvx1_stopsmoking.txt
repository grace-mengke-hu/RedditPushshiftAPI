Today is 2 weeks smoke free!

I'm 37, had been a pack+ a day smoker  since I was 14. I "tried" to quit many times before but I never succeeded. This time around has been tough but not nearly as bad as I expected. I honestly used to think I'd have to find a rehab in order to quit. Now that I quit I've realized my patience has improved (I used to hurry my kids and husband through conversations so I could go outside to smoke) my anxiety has greatly improved. I'm no longer afraid to go places for longer periods of time bc I don't have to worry about if/when I can smoke.

My only negative is that I'm so spacey now. My "life clock" was fine tuned to those half hour cravings. My schedule was worked around my smoking habits. Now that I'm not having as many cravings I can "lose" 4 hours to watching Netflix and not even realize it. I forget to start supper earlier or swap out the laundry. Small things but annoying even so ! I'm giving myself another 2 weeks as a "quitter" and then moving myself into the "non smoker" stage, working on being more organized, starting on task etc. 

Thanks to this group I've gotten to 2 weeks today!! This group and cinnamon mints. Loads of cinnamon mints.

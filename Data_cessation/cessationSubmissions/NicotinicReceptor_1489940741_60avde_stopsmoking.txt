Withdrawal symptoms and cravings make me feel like a little wuss

I started smoking about 9 years ago when I was diagnosed with Type I bipolar disorder. I've fluctuated between a few cigarettes a day and a pack a day at various points; currently fighting to keep it down to 3-4 smokes a day.

I'd like to quit, but I'm questioning my dedication. Smoking has become associated with a lot of things for me - hard thought, stress relief, celebration, just relaxing. If I'm sufficiently distracted I can make it through a day or maybe two without a smoke.

But inevitably, I keep running into a brick wall when the nicotine withdrawal gets to a certain point. It's literally physically painful and mentally distressing like very few things I've experienced - and I've lived through a fuckton of physical pain and mental distress.

Patches seem to make it worse somehow; my theory is that I'm used to high but brief doses of nicotine at various points in the day, and patches give me a tiny but steady dose throughout the day. It's like they remind me of what I could be getting but just tease on the edges of giving enough. (This is true of both Step 1 and Step 2 patches which I've tried at different times.)

The bottom line is that no matter how much I want to quit, it doesn't seem to be enough. As soon as the cravings start I will literally start pacing around and itching. They don't seem to get easier, only worse. Again if I can distract myself really well I might make it for a day or two but then it gets so intense I can't function, and I wind up buying a fresh pack and lighting up yet again.

If this is what it's like for everyone, I have the most intense respect for those of you who have toughed it out and managed to quit for significant periods of time (let alone permanently).

Not sure what I'm expecting from this, just had to get it off my chest I suppose. Ten minutes clean... here's hoping that this time is different.

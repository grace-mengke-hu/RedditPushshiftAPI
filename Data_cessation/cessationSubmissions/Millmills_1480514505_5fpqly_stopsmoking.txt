25 Days in!

Hi everyone, 

I've been lurking this sub for a while now and wanted to thank you all for your support. When I first found this sub I tried quitting cold turkey and ended up having to reset my badge every day for a week straight. I got an e cig and that has helped me quite a bit. I just switched to zero nicotine and hopefully soon I can get rid of my e cig completely. It has helped me quite a bit, especially when I was out with my friends drinking.

Here are a few things I noticed so far:

* I was pretty pissy for the first week, but since then my mood has improved

* About 3 weeks in I began coughing up phlegm in the mornings. Did this happen to anyone else and how long did it last?

* Cravings are worse for me at night and when drinking. I've tried to avoid heavy drinking
.
* The SmokeFree app has really helped me. Something about not wanting to re set the timer back to 0 keeps me motivated for some reason. 


I Just wanted to post here and talk about my experience. Good luck to everyone else that is quitting out there. You got this!

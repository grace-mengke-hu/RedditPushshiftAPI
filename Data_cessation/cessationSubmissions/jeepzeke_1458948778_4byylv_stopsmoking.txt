I really think I am going to make it this time.

Nine weeks in and cravings are small and very manageable. What is different this time is that when I see a cigarette, either on TV or in person, I don't think "mmmm that sounds good", instead I'm thinking "I used to do that and if I do it now it won't taste good". I know this from my COUNTLESS attempts in the past. I know that ashy, less than satisfactory taste you get from that first cigarette back. So for those who have tried too many times, just keep trying, eventually you'll make it.

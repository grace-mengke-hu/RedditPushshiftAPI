Should have quit during the semester...

I just finished up my school year and gave myself an ultimatum of stopping smoking as soon as the last final went in (but I actually stopped a little before that!)

As is turns out, I was using smoking as a reason to procrastinate. Now it's like, "No smoke breaks? Hmm... guess I'll just do x." "Still no smoke break? Well I did x, so I'll just do y."

I honestly feel fine, but MAD. I have wasted so much time! Those stupid things made me so tired, lazy, and complacent. But hey, maybe my apartment will be consistently clean for the first time!

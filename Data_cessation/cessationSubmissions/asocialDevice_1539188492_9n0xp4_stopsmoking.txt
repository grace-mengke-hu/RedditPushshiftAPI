Today I mean it

Been smoking for 14 years. I managed to quit for two years, but fell back on it last year. I've been telling myself I'll quit for the last few months. I can make it a day before I find some excuse.

It's my crutch. And I'm crying just thinking that I'm losing that but that's the silliest thing. 

I've done it before and i can do it again.

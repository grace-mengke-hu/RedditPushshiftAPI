Wellbutrin and nicotine?

Hey guys, so 30 days ago I quit drinking and doing drugs (hopefully for good!) and it’s been a pretty dramatic change in my life but I’m loving how much my life and mood is turning around. However I kept nicotine in my life. I figured quitting those would be fine for now and quitting nicotine at the same time would be way too difficult. This past Friday I was prescribed Wellbutrin for depression/ADHD and one effect I did NOT look into was the fact that it blocks the majority of nicotine’s effects on the brain! So Saturday and Sunday I had been feeling extremely irritable, anxious and smoking so much to overcompensate for the relief I couldn’t seem to get. Aaaand this morning after googling , I now realize why lol. I figure now would be a good time to quit anyways, but do any of you have successful experiences with Wellbutrin? Did you find it helped the cravings at all? I feel like my cravings have still been pretty intense, but when I smoke it just makes me feel sick, yet the nicotine craving isn’t relieved. It’s kind of driving me crazy and I just want to drink but I can’t do that and I feel like the next few days are going to be hell.

Having a bad day?

I have had a bad day!  Nothing went right today,  I am exhausted and extremely stressed out!    My mind was saying that it's because I have stopped smoking and it's just to difficult to do this, but then I remembered that when I smoked I had bad days too, having a cigarette could not have stopped those events happening and would not have resolved a thing.    Don't be fooled by a bad day!

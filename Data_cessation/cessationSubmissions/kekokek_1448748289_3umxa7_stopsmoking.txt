Just ran for the first time since I quit smoking!

Quit around 2 weeks ago, and ran for the first time today. I've always been a solid runner and was always in shape but smoking had started to prevent that for me.

First run, ran 2 miles and a solid 5-6 mph pace, I felt like i died. I felt like I died and was never born again. I feel like I got pummeled in the butt repeatedly for 5 hours straight by a 10 foot long pole. I felt like my girlfriend cheated on me. I felt like throwing up what I had last week. I felt like castrating myself. I was dry heaving and my insides hurt, but I felt fucking awesome. You don't really notice it, but once you get back into running after stopping smoking, you can feel your lungs literally start to heal itself and start to expand more.

TL;DR: Running feels good

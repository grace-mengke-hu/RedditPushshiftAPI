Advice to quit smoking. New here ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone Iâ€™m looking for advice to quit smoking because I need to respect my health more. My boyfriend has been a big inspiration as he used to smoke and quit and now heâ€™s trying to help me quit after many failed breaks from smoking that didnâ€™t last long. 

Currently I have a vape which I use 0 nicotine in that we bought together yesterday, a whole bunch of snacks and a pack of smokes. The plan is to have very little smokes and wean off of them through the week with the vape to fill the gaps and snacks when I want another too soon. 

This plan seems foolproof but Iâ€™ve been smoking since I was in public school and have accepted that I am very addicted to cigarettes. Iâ€™ve struggled many times just trying to take breaks when it wasnâ€™t affordable. Iâ€™m also addicted to Reddit and my boyfriend suggested I reach out here for advice. 

Iâ€™m wondering exactly what you all did or are currently doing to quit smoking. Iâ€™m looking for anything paid or free including snacks, lifestyle changes, and distractions. I really hope to hear back from this large community and thank you if you read all my rambling!

My love and hate relationship with smoking

I started smoking when I was 18, loved smoking ever since. Since I m 20, I smoke around 20 cigarettes a day. I thought of giving up when I was 23, and went cold turkey. Didn't smoke for almost a year. Life became tough with education and future, so, got back to smoking to relax. Thought of smoking 3 or 4 a day, in 15 days I am back at 20 to 25 cigarettes a day. Now I am 25. Planning to stop forever no matter what life surprises me with, in future. Searched for help and found this sub Reddit. Now, my last 10 cigarettes for the next 5-6 hours. Going to sleep after 5 hours. I m gonna post updates. Wish I can give up like I did 2 years back.

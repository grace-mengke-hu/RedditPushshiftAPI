Hopeful

Hello, all!

I am pretty new to this community but not to quitting smoking. 
I keep failing my quit attempts and have been trying to do it cold turkey every time. I’ve tried the gum which wasn’t successful but today I bought patches. 
They are really helpful! I haven’t had as nearly many cravings as before and I’m not feeling incredibly emotional and irritable. I know it’s still nicotine but I am hopeful that this time around I can kick it!

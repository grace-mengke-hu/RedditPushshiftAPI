Thinking of starting a nicotine anonymous meeting in my hometown or other form of support group

I decided to check and see if my town has any Nicotine Anonymous meetings, figuring I could use all the help I could get but it seems there are none anywhere in the state of Iowa.

Have any of you all been to meetings of this grup? Does it help? any advice on starting one or if I should do a different sort of group?

Had a really hard time last night, but not because I wanted to smoke...

My wife made tacos for dinner. I have smoked since before we were married. Half-way through my first taco, I had to put it down and I said this: "Holy shit, have these things been **this fucking delicious** *this entire time*??" To which, of course, she said yes.

That's when I nearly cried, because of what I'd been missing. For twenty fucking years. Oh. my. god. That's why I had a hard time, because I was so mad at myself...

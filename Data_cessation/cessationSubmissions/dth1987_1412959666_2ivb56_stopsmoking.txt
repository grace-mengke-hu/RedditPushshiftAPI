Quick question

Just was wondering a few things, as I'm attempting to quit. I've read a lot about people tasting and smelling significantly better after FULLY quitting. 

Also, I get random bouts of semi-dizziness and a general feeling of uncomfortable light headedness. Hoping these will let up too.

What have your all's experiences been post-smoking? Have you all noticed a big health improvement? I realize this sounds very elementary, but to me, there is a huge difference in hearing real results vs. articles about "what to expect".

I need to quit because I'm going to be a dad.

Hey y'all I was wondering if anyone has any experience with chantix or bupropion? Im going to get some patches tonight and see a doctor on Friday morning. Any tips or advice would be much appreciated. I'm a heavily dependent smoker, more than a pack a day and very addicted.

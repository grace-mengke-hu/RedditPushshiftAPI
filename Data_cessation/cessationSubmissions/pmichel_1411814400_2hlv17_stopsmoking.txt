Long term smoker finds freedom!

I've got to tell you I am feeling fabulous!!  

I am 53 and I smoked for 40 years. Been trying to quit the last 20 years or so.  What finally did it this time was the realization that I want to, deserve to, feel good. Smoking did the exact opposite. Smoking was instant self loathing for me.  I could never feel good about myself while I was smoking. Smoking was in fact CAUSING me to feel bad and holding me back from reaching any other goals as all my time was spent smoking or trying to quit. Once I really got this it became easy. 

I also, and if this offends you quit reading, no need to bash me, I prayed.  I prayed for help in walking away and not looking back and I believe that prayer was answered.  I have not really been tempted since I quit... maybe one or two fleeting moments but all it takes is remembering how awful I felt, drenched in nicotine, in my hair, on my clothes, wearing stale smoke like a stinking cloud you couldn't wash off, the taste in my mouth so awful and yet I would sit there and smoke one after another unable to stop, scared to stop. Addiction indeed.  
I am never going back!  This is my first post but I read daily and all of you have helped me so much. 
Thank you! 

if you are on the fence, come over to our side. Life is SO much sweeter here!

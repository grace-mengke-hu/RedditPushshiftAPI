Depression and work arounds?

Hey, I'm doing pretty well - 9 days in cold turkey with 0 slips but I'm feeling pretty terrible depression.

I was a 15 cig to full pack a day smoker and it makes sense with the loss of stimulation that something would happen, but it's getting really hard.

Has anybody else experienced this? 

I read that some herbal supplements are good for this, has anybody used any to success?

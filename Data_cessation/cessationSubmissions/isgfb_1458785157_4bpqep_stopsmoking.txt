10 days smoke free after 23.5 years of smoking

My sister in law sent me a link to Alan Carr's book. I started reading it and quit on page 30. I work at home, so I basically slept through the first 3 days and read 1Q84 when I was awake. It felt as though I would never be able to work, or do anything, again. I got out of bed on day 4 and managed to start getting some work done by day 6. 
My wife was very comprehensive with the aggressive zombie I turned into those first few days. 
My previous quitting attempt was in 2011 and it lasted for 6 months; after having an argument with my wife, I grabbed a pack that was lying around and smoked 2 that day, then 2 the day after, then 3, then 4...
I'm running every other morning, day 8 was amazing, day 9 so so, today was fine. Feeling so clean is amazing.

Intense cravings after 80 days. HELP

I quit smoking almost 3 months ago. I've been pretty moody since then with some anger/crying fits. It's partly because I'm very stressed - graduating, looking for a job, active in a lot of organizations, bf problems - but I really think a cigarette will calm me down a little. I just keep thinking of how relaxed it makes me. Any advice? :(

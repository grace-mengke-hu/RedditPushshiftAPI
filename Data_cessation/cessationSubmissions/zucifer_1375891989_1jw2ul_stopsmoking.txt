Instead of Focusing on # of Days I've Quit, I'm putting it in terms of Money Saved/Packs I HAVEN'T Smoked/Minutes I've Prolonged My Life By

I've tried to quit 1028039 times before, longest I have ever made it was a little under a year. I was on Anti Depressants at that time, which I've read makes doing hard things like quitting smoking much easier. I've tried the patch, the e-cig, the gum and had little to no success. 

This time I'm cold turkey-ing it and feel great about my decision! I'm  focusing on how many packs of cigarettes I HAVEN'T smoked and the money its saved me. So far I HAVEN'T smoked appx. 3 packs of cigarettes and I've saved about $21 dollars, And that's only 5 days!! 

If you take any stock in the 10 minutes of your life lost every time you smoke, I've already prolonged my life by an hour!  So what about the rest of you, how many packs HAVEN'T you smoked, how much money have you saved, and how many more hours/days/years have you prolonged your life by??

Insomnia while quitting?

Hey all! I recently just made the big step of dropping my smoking habit and it's going quite well but I've noticed it's been a bit harder for me to get to sleep due to anxiety that's probably being triggered by cravings. Last night was a particularly bad bout resulting in me barely sleeping even in spite of having taken melatonin to help me reach the dream world. I've been a zombie all day. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what you all do/have done to combat it?

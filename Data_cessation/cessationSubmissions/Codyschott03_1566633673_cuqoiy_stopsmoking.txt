Quitting vaping because of back pain

I know the effects of nicotine on your body. I have had back pain for almost 5 months and I am only 23.... Iâ€™ve decided to quit and see if that will help. I was just hoping I could get some insight on how long I will have to wait to see if my body can recover and some of the best habits to quit smoking/vaping

Almost through day 3.

I just posted 2 days ago, so I'm sorry if I'm posting too often. I just find that writing out what I'm experiencing is helping.  
I'm having physical withdrawals. Obviously. I smoked ~15 cigs a day for 12 years. But who cares? It's not painful, it's just slightly uncomfortable.  
  
The larger issue I'm having is my stupid brain telling me I should be smoking. Like earlier today I did a bunch of work in my yard. I worked my muscles, sweat like a pig and achieved some productive things. So what does my brain say when I'm all finished? "Sit in the shade and have a smoke, you deserve it."  FUCK THAT.  

I need to learn this new life. I was a kid when I started smoking. I don't know what it's like to live without it. What does this new person do to fill the gaps throughout the day?   

  
I'm going for a walk, thanks for listening.

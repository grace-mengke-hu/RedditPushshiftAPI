I just ripped up my cigarettes, and threw them, and my ashtray, into the garbage. I live in a house with 4 heavy smokers who smoke indoors.

Today is day one. I just finished reading Allan Carr's, "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking". I understand that I will have withdrawl and I feel nervous. However I have no desire to be a smoker. I smoked my last cigarette and reflected on how disgusting it actually was, and thought about the pain in my chest. I'm excited and thrilled at the prospect of having clear airways and better circulation. 
I'm not going to ask you to wish me luck, because I don't need any luck. I just need to not smoke. 
Living in the house with other smokers might make it difficult at times, but my grandpa always said, "Just because it's hard, don't mean it aint worth it." 
Peace and love <3

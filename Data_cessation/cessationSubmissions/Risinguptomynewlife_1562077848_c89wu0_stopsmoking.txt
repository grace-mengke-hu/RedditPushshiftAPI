Throat ache and coughing

So around 48th day i started coughing and my throat started hurting. Do you guys think it might be a withdrawal symptom? 
I tried looking at my throat, it doesn't seem so severly inflammed as it used to get when i used to smoke. It is just little bit red. But right now making me feel feverish and starting to hurt more in my throat.

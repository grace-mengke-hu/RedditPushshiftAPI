Almost 2 days and so sad

I haven’t smoked in almost 48 hours (25 a day/ 7-10 years). I want to feel proud but I just feel sad and a sense of loss for my good ol’ pal the cigarette. 

I’ve got some nicotine gum and have been keeping active but I’m struggling to sleep a lot and feel sluggish because I’ve been eating non-stop to keep distracted. I haven’t had extremely bad cravings surprisingly, I just feel on the verge of tears all day. 

Has anyone else felt like this? When did it get better?

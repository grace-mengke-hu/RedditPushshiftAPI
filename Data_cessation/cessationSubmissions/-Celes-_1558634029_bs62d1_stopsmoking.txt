4 days smoke free, having extreme dizziness/balance issues?

I was a 2 pack/day smoker for 5-6 years and decided I was done. Cold turkey stopped without any real craving issues or other symptoms so far... except for this insane dizziness and subsequent issues with balance/muscle weakness.

Is this normal? I know it has “only” been 4 days but... this is all new to me. Thanks.

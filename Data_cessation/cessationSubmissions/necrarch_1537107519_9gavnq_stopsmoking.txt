Stopped smoking 5 weeks ago, but...

Hello. I've just discovered this community and wanted some advice.

I've been smoking for 4 years (not that much, but still), and have decided to stop, mostly for health reasons. However, I still smoke weed, and my friends and I have always smoked spliffs, even the non-smokers. However, I feel like these spliffs set me back, and I'm unsure on how to approach the situation.

I feel like I'm more addicted to the cigarette and the smoking itself, rather than nicotine, but I don't know and would rather get some information before any potential confrontation.

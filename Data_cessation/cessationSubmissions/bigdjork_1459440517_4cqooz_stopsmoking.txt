1 month!

Finally got my star, been the longest month ever, but I really do feel like the worst is over. For anyone reading this who hasn't started or is just starting, keep with it!!! After 30 days I'm seeing things more clearly. I've still got a bit of a smokers cough, I still can't run up stairs without wheezing...but I finally clearly comprehend how not worth it it is. I still get the odd craving but I know now that smoking helps nothing!! I feel like I'm finally breaking out of nicotine's spell :)

EDIT: Thanks guys. BTW...$283 saved and 515 cigarettes not smoked. Adds up fast.

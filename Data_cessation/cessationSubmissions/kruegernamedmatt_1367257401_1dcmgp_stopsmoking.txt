2 hours in and i can already tell I'm gonna need a lot of help

Basically I have smoked a pack a day for the past 6 years. Pretty much every hour, on the hour. It's hour number 2 and I'm feeling like i can't even function. I've already gotten irrationally mad at something that didn't even matter but it altered my day so apparently, "Fuck that thing!" I guess I'm just here for some motivation and probably to complain a lot. haha

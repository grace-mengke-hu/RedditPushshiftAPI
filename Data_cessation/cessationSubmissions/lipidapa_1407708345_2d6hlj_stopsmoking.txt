Should I continue with the patch?

Hey everyone. Thanks for all the awesome posts and encouragements. 
I am on my day 10 since I stopped (~20 years). I am wearing the 21mg patch yet my patches will run out in 4 days. I wonder if I should continue with the next step or get rid of the patch completely? 
I would really appreciate your advice especially if you have had similar experience. Thank you in advance for all the help.

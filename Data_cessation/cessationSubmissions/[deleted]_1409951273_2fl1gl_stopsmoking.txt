Accused of being a snotty ex-smoker

I'm on the 6th day of what is probably my tenth attempt at quitting. I've always been a heavy smoker (20-30 a day) and I'm absolutely sick of always relapsing, so I'm really putting all my strength on this attempt, hoping it will be definitive.

However, one of the reasons I believe have made this so hard is that my closest friends and some close family members all smoke... a lot. Significantly, my partner is a ver heavy smoker (40-50 a day) and has no interest in quitting. 

Funny enough, it's not the constant temptation that's a problem, but rather the lack of support. I feel as if smokers think that my attempts at quitting are somewhat of an affront to them, like I've failed them and became one of those "health-obsessed, self-righteous" people that I myself used to hate.

So these people close to me *say* they are proud and wish me luck, and yet I know they wish I were still smoking. I've heard many comments around me along the lines of "ex-smokers are so snotty, they are the worst, much worse than non-smokers ... health-nazis, blah blah". It's brought me down to the point where I don't want to tell my partner that I'd rather keep my car smoke-free now, because I know he's just going to roll his eyes.
Obviously it's not an option to find new friends or clear these people from my life. But I was just hoping for some advice on how to cope with these kinds of attitudes and remarks.

Any advice or support would be much appreciated.

Books for me to read - my SO is a smoker

My SO is a smoker and has promised to stop.  Not that it's too relevant, but he is 30 and has smoked for about 15 years, with a few years off in the middle.  Unfortunately, he was supposed to stop 3 months ago, and he still smokes a pack a day.  Whenever I mention it, he gets extremely angry.  I tried to look on Amazon, and I found tons of books for the smoker, how to stop, etc.  Are there any books that I could read to better understand what he's going through, give more support, etc?

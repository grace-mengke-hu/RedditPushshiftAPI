Tight throat and swollen tonsils.

I quit smoking 3 weeks ago will be 4 on Thursday. I've had throat tightness for almost a week and the swollen tonsils just happened today. Just wondering if it's a normal process of my body cleaning itself or should I get checked out. I have had swollen lymph nodes since I was 17 they couldn't find the issues to why they are. Most part I'm healthy beside the lymph node, asthma, and I'm a thicc boi too.

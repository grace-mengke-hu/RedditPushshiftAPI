Look who's earned that glorious Smiling star... This guy!!!

Celebrating my 365th day without so much as a drag, tomorrow will be my actual year (leap year), I've been looking forward to this flair for a while.

To all the new quitters, like everyone says, it does get easier.  Just keep avoiding that next smoke, then after a while the only thing you're still consciously avoiding is standing downwind of smokers.  It smells awful.  One of my favorite parts of quitting was when the smell went from mmmmm cigarette... to ... ugh god... cigarette.  After smoking at least a pack a day for over 13 years, it's really great to know I have no interest in it and being certain that I'm not going back to it.

According to my smoke free app, after a year, I've saved $3,650, and not smoked a staggering 9125 cigarettes.

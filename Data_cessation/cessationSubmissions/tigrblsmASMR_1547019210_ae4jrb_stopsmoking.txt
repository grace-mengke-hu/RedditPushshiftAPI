I quit.

I really quit. I read somewhere that it takes the average person 11 times to quit to actually quit. I’m sure I’m at 50 but this is it. I started smoking when I was around 8 years old. No really. I’m 26 now. It’s been about a month since I’ve had a cigarette. My mother told me she quit at 36 and never smoked again. This gave me so much strength and conviction. I think it only appropriate if I do it 10 years sooner, because I should aim to be better and I want to make sure she knows how much I admire her life and her story. How much she influences me. We were all so unconscious, but she did a HARD thing and she said we were the ONLY reason why. She never wanted us to smoke. I just wanna make my momma proud in my 2 chains voice please pray for me 🙏🏼

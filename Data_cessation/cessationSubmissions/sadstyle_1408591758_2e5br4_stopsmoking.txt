"I don't smoke" or "I used to smoke but now I don't."

For a job interview, I was asked if I smoked and I instantly replied "I don't smoke." Then it hit me what I said and then added, "I used to but now I no longer smoke." 

I was glad that the first thing to come out was the former, because it was similar to the mindset I had prior to picking up smoking. I corrected myself because it felt like I was misleading them. 

I am probably making a big deal out of it. But is there a difference between a non-smoker and ex-smoker (apart from health stuff of course) when you describe yourself post-quitting?

I'm ashamed

I've been smoke free without a cig in 10 days. I'm really drunk right now. I'm probably not going remember this in the morning. But I smoked one. Does that make me a bad person?  I'm going to see replies to this in the morning and remember than I drank and smoked. I guess I need to reset my badge. I feel like shit right now. Damn it brain.

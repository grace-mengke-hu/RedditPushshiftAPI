What quitting smoking feels like to me

To me It as if you've lost a wife, significant other, or loved one and that is all they can think about for days weeks months except doing it to yourself on purpose along with the thought of that you can fix this by having another smoke and all will be well...I have been through this with a girlfriend in the past and I know the feeling will go away after time, and if I could have fixed the feeling I would have...in time I realized that relationship was not meant to be and neither is smoking...I know this will get easier with time it has to...

Sleep problems. Help

So basically I’m on my 5th day of being smoke free (quit cold turkey). I haven’t been able to get proper sleep since the start of my quit. Im getting about 3-4 hours of sleep and I really cannot take it already.. how long does this torture last for you(if you have it) and is there anything to help out with this issue??

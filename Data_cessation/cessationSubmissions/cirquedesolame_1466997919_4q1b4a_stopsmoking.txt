What do I do for a break?

50 hours in, cold turkey, not as easy as allan carr told me it would be.


What do I do for a break? Lets say I clean for a bit and I want to take a break what do I do? When I play music I will write for 45 min/1 hour then I would have a smoke and reflect on what I've done/what I have to do. I don't enjoy walking for no reason, besides, that's far more effort than lighting up was. I am an editor by trade, what do I do to take a break and reflect on my work?

QUITTING CAN BE A HAPPY PROCESS

Almost 5days
 This morning, I felt so happy and free, waking up without the need to put smoke on my chest to start the day or to be in my normal state.
Quitting is a happy process, I now spend money on ice cream, food, and face/ hair masks and taking care of myself, it feels so refreshing.
I also woke up happy and talked to my parents and had a long talk and also with friend, I no more need to take break and go smoke and come back woth a weird smell and vibe.
Truely, this is freedom.
Our thoughts shape our reality, stay positive and be proud of yourself, this is an experience that will make us develop skills so that weâ€˜re stronger than anything.
Lots of love and blue butterflies.

Day One - Need help

So I'm 13 hours into day 1... My skin already feels like it's crawling. I've been a smoker for about 15 years, with the mentality "it's taking off the years I never really wanted anyways" What are some tips to help get through these withdrawls. I literally want to rip my skin off it is crawling so badly.

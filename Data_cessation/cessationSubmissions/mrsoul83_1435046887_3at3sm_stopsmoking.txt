My experience with a hypnotherapist

Hi all,

I just went to see the most renowned hypnotherapist in Paris yesterday evening. The guy is specialized in quitting smoking, and also wrote a (fairly well reviewed on Amazon) book about it.

I did it because the doctor's nephew is a good friend of mine, and I got a discount thanks to this. Otherwise, the price would have been a show-stopper.

We had a group session (6 people sitting in comfy leather armchairs), and the hypnotherapist talked to us for about an hour and a half. 

He had a low and calm voice, and the one thing that struck me, is that he never mentioned the cigarette once.

Instead, he said stuff like this : "Your body was sleeping for a long time, but now your body is awake, and you know it doesn't want this unhealthy habit to be part of your life anymore."

We were listening to him with eyes closed. I swear my left neighbour felt asleep for a couple of minutes, as I could hear this breathing. 

This was a strange experience to be honest. I am pretty sure I did not went into "transe" or "semi-conscious" state, because I was really conscious when he said "at 5, you will slowly come back", but on the other hand, I can't recall the full monologue he had for almost 90 minutes. I remember parts of it, I remember I was also very relaxed.

So, how did it go ? I honestly don't know. One strange thing is that I had the worst cravings yesterday night, the worst since I stopped one week ago. I guess time will tell, and I will let you know if you are interested !

Cheers to all of you, and stay non-smoker my friends :)

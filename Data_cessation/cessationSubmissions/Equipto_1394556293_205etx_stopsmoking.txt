Very strong cravings at 143 days.

Now before you go trying to talk me down, its okay, i'm not going to smoke. Fuck cigarettes. I haven't had a craving in a long time but for the past 10 minutes its been extremely strong and honestly, painful. 

This is just a reminder to those of you earlier in your journey that no matter what, it is not worth it to cave in to the cravings. If I smoked a pack today, 143 days from now I would get this bad panic craving. Fuck that. We must never take one puff again, no matter the circumstances. We will be free from this eventually, but it is a much longer road than I ever thought.

No way in hell am I walking down this road a second time, hopefully by 365 days the cravings will never rise again. Good luck guys.

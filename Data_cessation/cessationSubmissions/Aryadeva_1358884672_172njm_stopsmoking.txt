Round Two. Let's go.

Alright, team, I'm trying again. Smoking my last cigarette as I write this. I'm sick and tired and anxious and life is too stressful - I can't deal with cigarettes bringing me down too. 

My last attempt lasted three weeks and ended because I okayed myself a few cigarettes, started feeling withdrawal symtoms from them and then started up again in order to overcome them. Goddamn - if I have to deal with panic attacks again it is not going to be pretty, but there it is. Better that than feeling wretched all the time.

Wish me luck, guys. I've read Mr. Carr and know that he's right - smoking only bandaid's the wounds it creates. If this is going to be a trial by fire, here's to the cauterization.

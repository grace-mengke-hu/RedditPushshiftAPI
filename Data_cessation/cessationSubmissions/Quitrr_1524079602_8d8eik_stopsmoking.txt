2 Months Today

My Smoke Free app finally reads 2 months today!  

I have tried to quit more times than I can remember. This time is different though. I am not mourning the loss of cigarettes. Sure I have cravings, although they are much less now than in the first couple of weeks. In past quits, I have always longed for a cigarette, that thing that I shouldn't have, and eventually always gave in. I never realized that I wasn't gaining anything from cigarettes. 

This time I read Allen Carr's book and watched the video on youTube. I purchased the Smoke Free app for my phone. I like the missions for each day on the app. I wrote down all of the reasons that I am quitting. This time it is going to stick. 

This site has been a huge help for me. I have it up every day. I rarely post or comment. The positivity here is great and I know it motivates SOOO many people. To all the people quitting and myself we can do this! I will not smoke with you today.

I literally. Cant. Do. This.

I want to quit. I do. I hate spending a quarter of our income on cigarettes. My husband quit. I feel tired all the time. I have no patience with my toddler because I’m constantly waiting for my next cigarette. 

But at the same time I do NOT want to give it up. It’s my ONE THING. My husband gets to go out, go to work, go hunting, go for coffee, go for a workout, do all this crap. Until my daughter goes to daycare in September. I CANT DO ANYTHING. She’s super difficult compared to other children her age and uncooperative and I just can’t get a damn break because my parents are in the USA, I live in Greece, and my in-laws refuse to do any babysitting. 

The ONLY way my day goes by is putting my daughters toys out on the balcony where she plays with the hose and I smoke my day away. I hate my life right now and just HATE that I have to give my cigarettes up. 

Any wisdom or pep talk or even tough love will be helpful.

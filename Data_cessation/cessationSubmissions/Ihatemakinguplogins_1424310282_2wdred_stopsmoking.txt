Help quitting gum

Smoke free for 5 months. I don't get cravings per se but I definitely experience certain triggers. I know they're behavioral. I know smoking won't help but chomping on Nicorette helps a lot and I don't think it's the nicotene.

So... I'm looking for gum. Not sugary-as kid stuff. Not sugar-free crap (taste makes me ill.) And something that the flavor lasts as long as Nicorette because I LOVE THIS STUFF! *sigh* Fruit Chill & Cinnamon are the best.
 :-P

Any ideas?

P.S. Been lurking here the whole time & you all are awesome!

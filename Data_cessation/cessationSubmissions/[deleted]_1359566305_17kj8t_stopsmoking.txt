Here we go again!

As some of you may remember, [I had a bit of a setback a couple days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/17e43c/ive_failed/) Well, 2 days and a pack later, January 30th will now be forever remembered as the day that I quit smoking for good! Thanks to everyone for your words of encouragement. Honestly if it wasn't for that I would have probably kept going for a month or 2 until I hated myself enough to give it another shot. You guys are awesome!

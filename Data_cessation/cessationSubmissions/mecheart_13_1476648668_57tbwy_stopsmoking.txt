First time trying to stop! tips?

I just turned 21 and have been smoking since I was 12. There have been phases where I have slowed down because of things happening in my life, but I always come back to it. Mentally I'm at that point where I really want to stop. It's affecting my hobbies, my carrier, and my love life. But at the same time I do still enjoy it... What can I do to change my way of thinking about cigarettes?

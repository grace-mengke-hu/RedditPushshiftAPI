Am I still quitting if I have an e-cig?

I have been smoking about a pack to a pack and a half a day for about 4 years now. I recently realized that I used to run 10.5 miles and have money in my wallet. Now money is wasted and I huff and puff after 3 miles. 

I've tried quitting many times but 90% of my friends smoke and were at the age where bars are our typical hangout. 

I bought an e cig just to try it a whole ago but now want to make a serious push to quit smoking. Will using the ecig keep my lungs fucked up?  Will it keep me addicted to the point where quitting it is as hard as quitting smoking?

Any answers, tips or suggestions welcome. 

Thanks guys.

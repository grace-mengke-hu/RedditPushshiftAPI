After 13 years, I finally did it!

I finished reading Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking on Saturday, and have not had a cigarette, nor even the desire to have a cigarette, since.  I went from almost 2 packs a day to nothing and I feel great!!

I've never been so relieved.  It feels amazing to think of myself as a non-smoker now.  Finding that book is the best thing to happen to me in a long time.  I highly encourage anyone who has tried other methods (cold turkey, patches, gum, etc) and failed to pick up a copy of the book and read it.

I've tried numerous times before and it never stuck, but this time I just know I'm done.  I've smoked my last cigarette.

Not a smoker yet, don’t want to start

I’m not a full time smoker. I have had smoked a pack a day for a few months years ago and have had the occasional cigarette here and there. I’m not addicted though the urges are there. I seem to want to smoke a cigarette when i’m around them knowing that I won’t really go out and buy a pack. I smoked 5 cigarettes in the last few days just from friends and family. I fear myself eventually saying fuck it and buying some. I’m 20 y/o and the fear of bad health isn’t that scary to me. I don’t have much fear of it for some reason. Maybe because I think health issues wouldn’t arise until far later. I feel like I can also afford it and easily will when my career rises in the future. I have a lot of family that do it and see my 75 y/o grandfather smoking more than a pack a day and he’s still very active. I kinda want a reason to be like “Ok no I don’t need to do this”. I also feel kinda cool when I smoke a cigarette. But then I will smoke one, not want to smoke one. And then 10 minutes later want to. It’s very confusing.

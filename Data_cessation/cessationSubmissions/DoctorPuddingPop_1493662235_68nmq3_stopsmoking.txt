1 year today!

Still can't believe it's been an entire year. It's crazy when you reach the stage where you vaguely remember what being a smoker is like and forget all the things and routines that came along with it.

If you are new just know you can do it!You are giving yourself the best present by even attempting to quit. Be proud of any hours and days you have and keep being proactive in your quit!

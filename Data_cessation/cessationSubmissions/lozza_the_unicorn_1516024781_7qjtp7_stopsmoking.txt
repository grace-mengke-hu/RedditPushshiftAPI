I've been a redditor for 1 year, since the smoking app i have suggested this site.  That means i have been seriously trying to stop smoking for 1 year.  I have been pretending to try for about 4 or as many as 10 years.  This quit attempt has been an absolute breeze, in fact I'm frightened I'll be tricked by my own mind back into smoking cos its been so easy.  "just have one" it says "you're so good at stopping, you could easily have one" what a wicked mind! so i've changed my badge and im on day 13 smoke free.  i really feel like with every quit attempt I've grown mentally stronger and each time im better at it, one of these times will be the time i manage to stop for good - i really hope its this one

Allen Carrs book helped me like it helped most folks here, but also
Paul mckenna hypnotist - how to quit without gaining weight was useful and of course you guys - what a community well done everyone

Just one day

Maybe it was because it was a cheaper cigarette than I usually bought maybe it was because scotch was the only thing I consumed that day  but after feeling sick in a stuffy smokey casino floor smoking disgusting cigarettes I haven't picked them up since. I keep the rest of the pack from that night in my car my most craving place and just the thought of having to smoke from that pack has kept me smoke free for a week and a half

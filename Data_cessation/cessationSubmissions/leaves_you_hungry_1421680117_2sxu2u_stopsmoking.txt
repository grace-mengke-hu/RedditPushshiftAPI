Over a year, and still going strong.. Thank you r/stopsmoking!

It's been a month over a year now. The first few months were really tough. In all honesty, I think it took me about 3 months before I felt like I could be a productive member of society again. But then, things just started happening. I started noticing how energetic I felt all the time. I got sick less frequently-- and when I did, I was sick for maybe 25% of the time I was when I was a smoker. 

I really tried to invest in not smoking I read Carr's book. I joined a live support group (which I found super cheesy, but weirdly effective). In the end, I think that the reasons I had failed before (I'd tried to stop smoking at least two dozen times prior), was that I simply wasn't willing to commit. Committing meant really putting effort into not smoking. And this meant being willing to put my time, energy, and dedication into not smoking.

It's been a year, and I told myself that I would improve myself with a major project every year. Last year was the year of no longer smoking. This year is the year of getting more fit. I'm a little late on that, but eating right and exercise.. getting my weight under control (100 kg).. these are my projects for the new year. 

I know it will be a long haul for not smoking, but I feel ready. I am happy to have "graduated" from r/stopsmoking to r/fitness. In a set of all the factors that contributed to my not smoking, I can't really gauge the effect of any one source. But you all were my first step, and I can't thank you enough.

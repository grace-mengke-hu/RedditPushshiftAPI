Wow, day 17 and no cigarette cravings. Day 13 for my boyfriend.

When I quit I told my boyfriend that I don't want him to feel pressured to try to quit right away and that he needs to wait until he's ready. I went and got a new e cig (I was using one of those shitty Blu e cigs before) and he came with me. He had one cigarette left after we bought it. He had his last one that day and hasn't smoked one since! We both love the e cig and already got a bunch of different flavors of the e juice.

I've gone jogging a few times since I quit and it was so much easier. I can run farther and faster, my skin and teeth look better, I can have sex longer, and I can lift weights longer. I even added 5lbs to my dead lift. I was concerned about possible weight gain but my appetite has stayed the same and I've counted my calories. I've lost two more pounds since I quit and I'm looking and feeling good.

Cigarettes are so stupid. I don't know why I even started, or why I didn't quit sooner. This is great! We can all do it. I'm so glad this subreddit is here.

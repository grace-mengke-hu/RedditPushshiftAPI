3 month finished. Thank you guys. But I have one question regarding 'party smoking'.

Hi,

So i did it to this point. Really great community. Everyone in here is so supportive, that's excactly what you sometimes need to stop smoking.

I just want to remember at this point how addicitve this shit is. 
Well, I'm only 16 years old and started smoking when i was 15. In the beginning i just wanted to try it because it "looked cool" and because I was really curious about smoking. Man you get addicted to cigarettes so fast. They also got an effect on me in another way: I got so slow at running, it's a shame. And my body overall felt somewhat "strange". Can't really describe it, just not a good feeling.

I decided to quit after a party and it really worked. Drinking tons of water is definitely what helped me. I had so many cravings considering I haven't really been smoking for a long time compared to other people who have been smoking for years or even decades.

Well I did it now. My Body gets in a better shape again and I think I recovered overall from smoking. Thank you guys, the posts and support are really great in this sub.

I just got problem, reddit: How can i avoid smoking at parties and stuff? Because don't get me wrong, I really don't want to smoke again, but smoking at parties with other people can get a conversation going or help to talk to people you don't really know. It's hard to describe, i hope you know what i mean. If someone at a party asked me to smoke again I'm not sure if I can always say: No, I don't smoke. Can anybody help me to avoid this party smoking?

TL;DR: Tell your kids really not to touch cigarettes, they are dum and don't know what they do.

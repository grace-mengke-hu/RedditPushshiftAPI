Why do most smokers smoke a pack a day

It seems like most people here smoked a pack a day, why 20. I smoked a pack sometimes 2 if it was a stressful day. But generally 20, is there a reason for 20 cigarettes a day?
Or is it that those of us who smoked as much as 20 a day are the ones who find it harder to quit a that's why we've all gathered here in th subreddit?
What's your thought?

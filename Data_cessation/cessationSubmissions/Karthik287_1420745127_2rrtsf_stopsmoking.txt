I messed up

I messed up. I was upset over some personal problems I've been having and some things that have been happening around me that are beyond my control. I went for a long drive and managed to find a shop that is open at 1am(not too easy in India). I bought a pack and smoked 3 cigarettes only to find that they didn't calm me down, they didn't help me find a solution to my problems and I didn't even enjoy them. If anything it only made me realize that my decision to give up smoking was most definitely the right one. I really don't know if I should reset my badge or not. I do know I don't want to smoke cigarettes any more.

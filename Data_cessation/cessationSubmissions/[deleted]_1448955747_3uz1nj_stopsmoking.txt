Sick of smoking. I've already quit. Using a vape have questions.

I'm currently taking a few puffs on my vape of 3 mg nicotine e juice. 3 mg is the lowest amount of nicotine besides 0 mg that you can get. I'm wondering if I am switching my dependency to the vape juice?

My cravings aren't terrible but they've been noticeable. I'm going to quit the vape once I've not smoked for a week to make sure no nicotine is in my system. Is this a good strategy or should I put the vape away now?

I think I need help right now guys

I am drinking and well, it's been a while since I've had a decent drink and well what do you know.. I feel like having a smoke.

My plan is to finish my jack and coke here and go and buy a 10 pack of cigarettes. Will I buy another pack soon after? Probably..


I havent smoked for months at this point and before that it was a matter of a year or so, can anybody help me.

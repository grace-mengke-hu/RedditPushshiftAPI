withdrawl symptoms?

im 17 years old and quit juuling 21 days ago im just curious to if its normal to feel spaced out and derealized still, its like brainfog sorta from time to time things just seem weird but then seem normal, and ive been having panic attacks numerous times a day where it feels like my heart is pounding, so if i could please receive some advice id appreciate it

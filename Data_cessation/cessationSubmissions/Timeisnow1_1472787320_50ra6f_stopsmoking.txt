7 miles in 7 months

I smoked for over 15 years at a pack a day.  The only time I ran was when I was running to the store for a pack of cigarettes.    Well I never thought I could quit smoking but I tried.  I also started running at the same time, ( if you call it that)  I could only run a few minutes and I would be out of breath and I was out of shape.
  Running kind of turned into my new addition I run almost evey day trying to go further and faster.  I started to eat better just so I could go running without getting pains.  Well today I ran 7 miles which is over 10 k and this is also my 7 month of not smoking.   I never thought I could do it, and if I can do it so can you.  

It does get easier,   I hardly think of smoking now, it will be days without cravings and if I do get one it is usally just a thought.  I still have the occasional dream about smoking that gets me going. Life is so much better being a non smoker and the month of hell is so worth the end result.   

Good luck to all of you just starting out keep going one day at a time.  My advice is try to find a new addition preferably one that is healthy.

Four days....and I feel terrible.

I started chantix last month. On February 29th, I had my last cigarette. The following day went surprisingly well since the chantix had done its job. Day 2 was a little rougher and ended with a headache and a very small fever (99.4). Day 3 waking up felt like the worst hangover ever, despite having not drank - headache, soreness, nauseous, light headed /dizzy. Is this normal while quitting or should I go to my doc? Chantix is helping cravings, those haven't been a problem, but I have felt like utter shit since a few hours after my last smoke. Please advise. :(

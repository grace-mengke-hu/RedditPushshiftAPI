Day 2...

Nighttime is when the craving hits hardest.  So now Iâ€™m in the tub so it will keep me from heading to the store.  I havenâ€™t taken a bath in ages ðŸ˜‚.  It was really touch and go there though, almost walked down to the garage instead of up to the bathroom.  It will get easier, right?  

Have an event tomorrow where I will be drinking...always a major trigger for me and Iâ€™m nervous.

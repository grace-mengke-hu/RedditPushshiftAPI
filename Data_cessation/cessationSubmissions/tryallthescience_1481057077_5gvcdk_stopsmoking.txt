Putting together a care package for my husband who is quitting tomorrow. Any advice?

Background: my husband has been smoking about a pack to a pack and a half a day for about 15 years. We're talking about trying to have children soon and he decided to quit smoking. I quit just over a year ago.

I want to put together a package for him full of things that would help him get through it. I'm going to be including lollipops, sunflower seeds, gum, and straws. He has an ecigarette already (which he hates). Is there anything else I should be including? It seems like a bad idea to be relying mostly on food, but I know that the oral fixation is the main problem with him.

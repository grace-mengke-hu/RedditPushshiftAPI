Pain in the chest?

Hey guys :)

As you can see,i didn't smoke in the last 11 days.
It's my first attempt to stop smoking ever and i'm actually doing great.
I'm 24 years old and i started smoking when i was 15.
I'm not having any problems when it comes to avoid smoking cigarettes but in the last few days i had several situations where i had serious pain in my chest...i also had to cough badly here and there...
I never had the smoker-cough in all these years and i never felt bad in general...
Don't get me wrong...All this won't discourage me from stopping my smoking habits but i am kinda worried because i have never experienced this and it feels really bad...
Anyone got any experience with this?

I feel depictions of cigarettes and smoking should be treated like other content that's known to be emotionally triggering.

One of my biggest struggles is seeing people smoking. In movies it's the worst, but even pictures or gifs online. I think, just like people often post [CW: Rape] or [CW:Self Harm] before content like that, and are generally considerate of what they post without warning and where, it should be more of a common practice to have a [CW: Smoking] or [CW: Cigarettes] in places where one wouldn't be expecting them. 

Edit: The point of this is less to convince you guys and more just to express this opinion I have. I know it won't really happen.

My N.O.P.E. update

So it has been almost forty days and, let me tell you, this community has really helped me get through the last month or so. I am still worried though. I've quit before and then started again, so my life right now is being constantly vigilant to signs that the nicotine monster is trying to take control again, which includes convincing me that I can "just have one."

Quitting is easy. It is staying quit that is hard. I keep trying to tell myself that this is my chance to do it all over again. Us smokers always say "I wish I had never started," but when we quit, it's so easy for us to slip down that path once more. I'm trying to make this my second chance to have that moment again. To look at a cigarette and say "No. I'm not going to smoke that" like I wish I had done so many years ago.

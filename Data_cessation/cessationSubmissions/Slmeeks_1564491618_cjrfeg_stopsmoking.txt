This one will stick...BECAUSE of my relapse

I have never tasted something so terrible!! Then it made me so sick I curled up on the couch for over an hour thinking I was going to die!! It’s incredible how the disgustingness is masked when we are used to the smokes. Can’t believe I used to do that 20Xs a day and freaked out when I couldn’t smoke!!

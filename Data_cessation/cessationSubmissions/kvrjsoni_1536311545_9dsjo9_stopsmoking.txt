Second Attempt (Cold Turkey)

6th day today after my previous slip up on 12th day. Now I don't think about smoking that much. I try to avoid places where I'd have smoked. Like I'll be avoiding clubs and drinking for a while now. Also when I pass by a smoker the smell feels weird, I don't like that smell, it doesn't feel like I was ever a smoker. I think I can make it now!

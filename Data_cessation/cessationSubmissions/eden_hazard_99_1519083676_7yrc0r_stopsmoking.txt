What to do when taking a break?

I used to step outside and smoke while listening to songs to take a break every two hours when I'm working. 


Ever since I quit, I've had no reason to step outside of my workstation. Those breaks really helped me refresh and get my mind focused before I got back to work. 


What other things do you guys do to replace those midnight smoke breaks?

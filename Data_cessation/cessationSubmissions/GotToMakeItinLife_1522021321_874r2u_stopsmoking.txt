Keep buying packs of cigarettes to throw them out half way through? Keep quitting.

I have thrown out over 10 packs of cigarettes. I haven't smoked in almost 4 months. I was never a daily smoker. However, I have smoked tons of cigarettes especially when drinking which I gave up then switched to cigars and even dip tobacco (which I know I can't do anymore because of those damn mouth sores I get from it). 

I know it is because of stress. I have an anxiety disorder. I am managing it the best I can. I have tried nicotine gum, electronic cigarettes and patches. 

Damn, it is so tough to kick this habit for good especially when I go around people who smoke. A lot of my friends do. My cousin and brother smoke those vaporizers which I stumbled on back in 2007 when they just came out and hit the market. I buy and sell goods. I knew there was money in it and shop have capitalized on it. I would be loaded now. I also started a job in admin order processing which is stressing me out. They barely trained me and I have to process orders using SAP. It is only for a year but kinda sucks.

Sorry for all the bitching and moaning. I guess I need to vent. I feel a relapse coming on. I am so tempting to buy a pack of Marlboro Lights it's ridiculous.


EDIT: Has anyone tried hypnosis to quit smoking?

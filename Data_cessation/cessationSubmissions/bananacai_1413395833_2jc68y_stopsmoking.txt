.. Its been a long time since my last smoke.. I caved due to everything going on in my life today... I lit it up, had 3 drags and threw it away in utter disgust. I'm even more upset and disappointed in myself... I can't believe I broke. 

I suppose that warrants a restart, either way. Don't make the same mistake I did..

Stay strong fellow redditors.

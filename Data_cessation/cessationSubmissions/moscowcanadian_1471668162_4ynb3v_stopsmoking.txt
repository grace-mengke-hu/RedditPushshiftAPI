A little over 3 weeks in, feeling great! Worried about big transition.

So I finally cut tobacco out of my life completely a little over 3 weeks ago. I was on the patch for 2 of those weeks but am now nicotine free! I am wondering if anyone had advice about transitioning my life style. I am working in the wilderness now around a few smokers, but will be returning to Toronto in the fall for school, living in a frat house and will see plenty of smokers. Any advice?

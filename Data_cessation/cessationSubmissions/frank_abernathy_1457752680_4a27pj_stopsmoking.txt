Warm Weather

I quit in October and it's been easy as long as it's been winter, as I never really want to go outside. But it's starting to get nice out and I remember enjoying sitting outside and smoking and it's making some of the cravings Coke back. I don't think I'll cave - I'm pretty committed and I am happy being an ex-smoker. But does anyone else get more cravings once it gets a little warmer outside?

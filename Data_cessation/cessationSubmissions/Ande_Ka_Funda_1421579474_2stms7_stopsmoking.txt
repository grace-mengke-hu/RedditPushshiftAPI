Slipped after day 17 :(

Didn't have one puff till now. Even today had no craving or anything.

Missed gym for past two days in a row and also over ate for the last two days. Gained about a kg and was feeling so shitty about myself.

I instead smoked a cigarette and made everything a million times worse.

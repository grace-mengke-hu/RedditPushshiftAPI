Anyone have any luck with the Nicoderm CQ patch?

Went to the doctors today, and we discussed my want to quit smoking. He picked a date for me to start the patch (December 1st) and he'd see me another month later to see the progress and lower the dosage if needed. He also told me to menthol are more addictive than regulars (which is what I smoke) and told me to grab one more pack of menthol and then after that, switch to regulars. I quit cold turkey when I was pregnant back in 2013 but it was much easier back then because I had another human growing inside me. I know I don't have the willpower to quit without any help. So I'm going to stick with the plan we spoke about and start the patch December 1st. I've read a lot of good things about Chantix but I co-sleep with my son and don't want the vivid dreams and all that associated with the pill.

Has anyone had any success with the patch? Any side effects I should be aware of? Tell me about your experiences!

TLDR; How was your experience on Nicoderm CQ? What should I expect?

Is it normal?

I had one pack of cigarettes 6 months ago during my school's graduation night. It was a special occasion, I was drunk, and everyone was smoking. I was perfectly fine afterwards, no effect on me (that I felt). A couple months ago I started university, and things haven't been going so great for me. The thing is, during one of my low points two or three days ago, I started thinking of going out and buying a pack of cigarettes, and smoking them just to have something to do. I tell myself that it's just one pack, and that I won't get addicted. But I haven't bought them. Since then it has been pretty much driving me crazy whenever I'm alone. I just keep thinking about going out and buying that one pack. 

My question is, is this what being addicted feels like? And is it normal that it's happened 6 months after I had the only cigarettes in my life?

Thank you very much.

Nictotine-less Ticks and substitutes

So I have found that since I quit smoking, I am biting the inside of my lips more. I always used to, but this has become daily. ...like my lips heal themselves when I sleep, and then almost right when I wake up, I bite them again.  I think it is a nervous tick from having quit smoking. Anyone have any relief or substitution? Currently on day 18 of no cigarettes and no nictotine. _smoked for 14 years. -Care

Stopped Smoking midday Thursday 27.08.15

Been wanting to quit for a while, having last smoke as close to midnight as possible on a Sunday, beginning Monday and folding before the day was out using lame excuses. 
On Thursday it finally dawned on me that I wasn't getting anything out of smoking aside some temporary relief from stress (which was mainly brought about because my nicotine levels had dropped). 3.5 years weed smoker, 2.5 year cigarette smoker. Stopped weed around 6 weeks ago, my mind is much stronger which has made this decision easier for me. 
Benefits so far: stains from fingers have vanished, feel better about myself, stronger mind, sense of smell and taste have improved. Negative sides: anger, agitated, moments of pacing, coughing up brown speckled phlegm(benefit to me but to others gross), occasional ranting?! 
Pleased with my decision, hopefully any damage Ive done won't be enough to cause any problems for me in the future.

1 month today!

I never imagined I could be so happy as non-smoker. It always seemed like I would be missing something without smoking in my life, but I was SO wrong. My life has improved drastically in the past month, and it feels like so much longer since I quit. It's only 30 days compared to 10 years of smoking, but I know it's going to get even better from here! 

I also just started reading Allen Carr's Easy Way, and I really wish I had read it before I quit. It would've helped me tremendously during those first couple weeks I'm sure. But I'm reading it now, and I still find it really helpful! So I definitely recommend it, even if you've already quit. 

Lastly, if you're in those first 2 weeks, hang in there, it's so worth it guys!!!

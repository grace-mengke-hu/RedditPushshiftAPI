Almost 24 Hours Smoke Free

I'm on my first smokeless lunch break at work, which was always one of my biggest triggers for smoking. I'm doing okay, I read through some posts on here, called my mom, and got a coffee. 

I'm so determined to succeed this time. I'm not trying to quit, I'm absolutely positively quitting for good! 

Finding this subreddit yesterday was the final straw for me. So many people saying that if they could do it I could too, so here's hoping!

Thank you all for your positivity and I hope you're all doing well today too!

My last Day 1

I've tried more than 20 times to quit. This is the last time. I feel sick every time I suck on one of these things and they no longer gives me the good feeling I used to get. I am opening a new chapter to my life, and it's going to be a life where cigs are not a problem. Usually, the first month is where I crack. I will not let that happen anymore. I've got almost six months of sobriety under my belt; I can't wait to be six months tobacco free.

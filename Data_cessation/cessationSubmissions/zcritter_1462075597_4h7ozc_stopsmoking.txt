Almost had a drag tonight

I am disgusted with myself and yet still craving at the same time.

Friends birthday dinner, much food, laughs, wine, etc...a couple actually got to the dinner and sat down in front of me, and I could smell they'd smoked a cig before coming. It made me embarrassed for all the times I'd tried to pass it off to my parents that I was quit. 

One of my closest gfs is a trauma nurse and still smokes heavily, I rearranged our purses and saw 2 packs of 'our' cigs. This quit I haven't really been around still smokers (we live far), so of course all through dinner I'm on my I don't smell high horse in my head, yet as soon as We step outside after I am envying them lighting up.  I even ask my gf for a drag and she goes are you sure, before another (a mom who quit for years but started again) stopped me and said don't, and another one of my gfs (stepping down via ecig over a year and 1 month e cig free) basically helped  talk me down. I was saying maybe if I taste it and know what's it's like it will remind me I don't want it. 

If I didn't have really good friends, smokers and non, I might be a smoker again. 

I was worried about the 2/3 month complacency ... I was right. J saved my ass. SMOKERS saved my ass.

A quitting app that won't notify me very often?

Hey everyone!

I've been creeping this sub a lot today. I've wanted to quit smoking for a long time. I gave it a fairly honest effort about 6 years ago but I relapsed and that was that. It's been a thought since then - but nothing that really came to fruition.

This last year I've been thinking on the matter more, as I'm almost 30 and 30 has been a "cut off" in my mind. This has been multiplied by my boss who often gives me shit about smoking and tells me to "grow up". Lol. He quit 6 or so years ago. He's a very blunt person.

ANYWAY... My question is in regards to accountability. Last year I lost 30 pounds using myfitnesspal and what really helped me was weighing in and posting my reaults on Instagram. It was pretty embarassing at first, telling everyone what I weighed. But as I continued and posted my results I felt pride and my friends/acquaintes would give me supportive feedback. It might sound childish but it truly kept me accountable and on track.

Im wondering if there is an app that logs how many days you have been smoke free, something I could screen shot to post, but DOESN'T notify me of how long Ive been smoke free/other things all of the time. I just feel like constantly being reminded of smoking isn't going to help my cause.

Thank you so much and good luck to everyone!

I’m not perfect yet?

Had to laugh... I’m rushing around work and I haven’t smoked in almost four days. Found myself thinking actual words, “why aren’t I skinny yet?” 

I haven’t been eating clean.  I quit smoking. 

I’m so proud of myself, and not to diminish my four whole days of being smoke free, but this was clearly a symptom - not everything will be perfect because I did one awesome thing for myself.

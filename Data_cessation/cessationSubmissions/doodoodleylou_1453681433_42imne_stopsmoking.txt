Pretending to smoke.

So I quit smoking just over 2 weeks ago and I found what helped me the most was pretending to smoke unlit cigarettes.

I know this might not work for everyone, but it really helped to have them around for when I was drinking or having a stressful day.  I realized I didn't have to give up the hand-to-mouth fixation part of my addiction if I didn't want to. 

I just told myself I am aloud to like anything I want about cigarettes- the action, the smell, the imagery, the nostalgia- I just don't need to light one.  I'm finding the more time passes the less I care about any of these factors anyways and the less I feel the need to pretend to smoke.

Keep it up fellow quitters!

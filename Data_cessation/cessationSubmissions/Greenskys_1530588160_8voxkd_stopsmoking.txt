2 Months today.

I’m at the point in quitting where the initial Adrenalin rush is gone.  My lungs have felt great for a while now, I can feel my circulation and stamina has improved. And for that reason, I have been having stronger cravings than I had from the get-go.  

It’s not easy an easy task what we are going through. Every day is a bizarre struggle, But knowing I’ve gone this far after 10 years makes me stupendously proud of myself.

Crash

Yup. No excuses. Dealt badly with work stress. Fell back on panic, an old response. I know better.

Let me feel bad a bit.  Ashamed for a day. Pick myself up. Dust myself off. Firm up my resolve. Reset my badge. I will rise again.

No advice required. Just fessing up. Promising to lick this problem once and for all.

3 days without smoking! My girlfriend hates it and is always on me to quit. We just got back from the beach and I haven't had one since before we left Thursday.

Think this was finally the kick I need to quit. Back to work tomorrow with fellow smokers. I think if I can get through tomorrow I may finally have the breakthrough I've desperately needed to quit. Wish me luck.

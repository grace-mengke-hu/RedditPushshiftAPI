A WORKING smoking ALTERNATIVE if you can't QUIT.

Hi everyone, I've been around many smokers in my life and most didn't have the will power to quit completely. This will ultimately lead to bad health effects in the future for them. Everyone knows it's better to not inhale anything, than to. The problem with smoking is not only that your burning tobacco, but the ingredients that your burning creates further problems. Your will start to cough up black tar, and it will get hard to breathe.

SO what's the ALTERNATIVE to QUIT?!

Many smokers don't take this method seriously, and pass it off as just as harmful. Despite most doctors agreeing it is at least 95%-99% healthier than smoking. Once smokers have switched to "this method" they have seen that they are no longer coughing up black tar, breathing has become easier, and overall they can expect to now live longer.

The alternative to quit smoking, is VAPING. There have been many test done, recently some on YouTube showing one month of smoking vs one month of vaping. Let's just say that one cigarette turned out to leave worse results than a whole month of vaping. In this test, they used cotton balls to act as the lungs. Then they used air pressure to suck in either the vapor or smoke, and it would be blow out another tube on the opposite side. With smoking, black tar was left everywhere.. but with vaping the cotton was clear white with a little moisture on it. A fun fact, scientist say you inhale more water vapor when showering then you do when vaping. So, does this confirm the 99% safer claim? Well, not completely but we can definitely see that is is much safer.. we just cant 100% estimate how safe it is exactly.

WHY is it SO HARD to QUIT?!

Well, first off you're most likely addicted to nicotine. Now you ask "doesn't vaping contain nicotine?"

Yes, but no. You can get it with nicotine, and you can also get it without it. Many people think nicotine is the harmful part in cigarettes, when in reality most scientist say it's just as harmful as caffeine. Switching to vaping will provide you with the same experience as smoking, just with more flavor options, and less health effects.

My WHOLE POINT in this LONG essay?

If your addicted to nicotine and you don't want to quit it, why smoke cigarettes when there is a healthier and more enjoyable nicotine alternative out there? There are small vape devices that resemble a cigarette such as the JUUL, you can also look into the Suorin Air. I would suggest getting a high nicotine e-liquid when you're first quitting. I've seen the high content really keep most former smokers off of the bad stuff.

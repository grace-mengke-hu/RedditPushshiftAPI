A little diary if you don't mind

I am not smoking for more then 3 days for the first time in 13 years. That was hard.  Getting over chest pain was bad, but time after eating was worst to hold clean. I almost bought pack just now but I stopped at last second. So I thought I need diary to keep it rolling. If its allowed, I will be sharing my thoughts and struggles here. 

First of all I am 27, started smoking at 12 so I am smoking for most of my life. Since I was 15 I do it every day, and got through normal stuff like giving up 1000 times etc.  I read that book about giving up but it didn't work. Maximum time without cigarette was about 3 days. Now its been more then a week I am not smoking so I think I have decent chance to finally do it. 
I don't wanna go into details, but I gave personal promise to God that I will give up. Sounds stupid, but I kinda owe something to higher forces. And that is the only reason that keeps me from cigarette. Hope it is gonna be good start.

Is was 4 months clean...

But then drunk me decided that one cigarette woukdn't hurt. I already bought my own pack and I can't seem to stop. I don't even want to stop because nicotine got me in it's trap again. 

I can't explain to you guys how shitty it feels to give in. My advice to everyone here is to try your hardest to stay strong. Nicotine is your enemy and if you smoke the only thing you do is admit defeat.

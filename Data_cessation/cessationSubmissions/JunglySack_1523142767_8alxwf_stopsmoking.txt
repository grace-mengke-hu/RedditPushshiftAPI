Tips for stopping?

Hi
I won’t get into personal details too much, so I’ll make a long story short
I started smoking cigarettes when I was 15 after I got in with the wrong crowd at school. I’ve been smoking since then (I’m now 19 turning 20 in a few months). I know that it’s not a SUPER long time to be smoking, but I find it hard to quit because I was so young when I started. I currently go to a college where everyone-literally everyone- smokes cigarettes. I’ve tried to quit during my two years here but because wherever I go people are smoking, it’s very difficult to resist the urge. For those of you who have successfully quit, I’m wondering if you have any advice to help me when I’m around people who smoke? I can last when I’m alone but as soon as I’m around people who smoke I crave it and I can’t say no when someone offers. I hate smoking and I’ve smoked so many cigarettes in the last few weeks and I know it’s disgusting and I want to stop. I really want to quit but I just need help being able to resist smoking

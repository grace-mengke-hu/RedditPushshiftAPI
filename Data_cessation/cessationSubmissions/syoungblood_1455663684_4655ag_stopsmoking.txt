My first post: Almost 11 years a smoker.... How do I quit?

23F. Just finished my last cigarette of my pack. I have been thinking about quitting (again) for a few months now. Longest I have gone without smoking was about 2 months, and that was with an e-cig so i'm not sure that counts. 5 days was my longest going cold turkey. I've been told you won't quit unless you truly want too. How did you know when you were DONE? I don't want to die from this.  Sometimes I really think I don't have the willpower to quit. Tips, tricks, anything would be helpful!

6 days smoke free, now vaping but worried I'm not getting healthier?

Hi everyone, 

Finally bit the bullet & stop smoking after 10 years (17-27). I used a vape to ease the stress, 12mg of nicotine in the juice. My worry is that I'm not experiencing any nasty withdrawal symptoms. I actually want to cough a bunch so I know my lungs are working again! 

Small effects so far: a few mouth sores, sneezing quite a bit (have bad allergies, heard smoking actually helps control them)

Sounds a bit silly, but I'm worried the vaping is inhibiting my body from regenerating post cigs. Is that possible?

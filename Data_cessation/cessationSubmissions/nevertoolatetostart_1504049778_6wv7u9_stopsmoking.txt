once quit for a month...

hi yall... i started smoking at 18 and am a pack a day smoker since then(i'm 23 now). 

i tried quitting(actually quit) for a month then i had the histeric feeling that my midterms were close and i could not take them without smoking to cope with the stress and i know that was bullshit though.

i relapsed just because of the fear i guess now i regret it and try to quit again but i need to find motivation somewhere. do you guys have any ideas? i'd be glad... share your experiences with me

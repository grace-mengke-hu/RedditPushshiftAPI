My Christmas gift to myself.

I quit smoking today. And by today I mean I smoked my last cigarette this morning. I knew it was today I would quit when my usual 'I should quit' line of thought was assaulted with a counter remark in my brain 'Then don't buy another pack. You keep saying each pack is your last one. You're out. This is it. Do it now.' 

So here I am seeking support and giving myself the best Christmas gift: giving up nicotine. I'm bummed at the prospect of gaining* weight and being bitchy but I plan to be as mindful as possible. 

Huzzah! I can do this.

Yup. 

I can do this.

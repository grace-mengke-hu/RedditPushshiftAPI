This time it has to be different

Hi everyone. I'm not sure exactly why I feel I need to make this post. I suppose I just needed to make a public announcement of my commitment this time. I have been trying to quit smoking for the past couple years and have been consistently failing. I am hoping that this time I quit - today - it will be different. I have been smoking since I was 20. I'm 25 now. I know that if don't stop soon I will die because of it. And while I don't feel I have too much, or too many people, to live for now, I know that someday I will and someday how I act, and what I choose to do will directly impact on others lives. So today I have quit smoking, not just for me, but for those that I love and those that love me.

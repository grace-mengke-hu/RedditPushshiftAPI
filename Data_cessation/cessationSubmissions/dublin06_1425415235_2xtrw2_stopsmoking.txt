Quit a week before my exam, wrote my exam fantastically yesterday, feeling real good!

I did have my doubts. Wouldn't it be really stupid to quit during 'Pr√ºfungsphase'? However, smoking hadn't helped my stress much during the last exam, so I decided to quit smoking as soon as I finished Carr's book.

Am I glad I did! Whew. It was hard during the day before the exam, at times all I really wanted was to feel the filth of the smoke rush through my throat, somehow I felt it would make me feel better. I really have no clue how I held on, but somehow I made it through the night. For the first time in years, I was able to stay up all night learning. I showered, cooked, walked my room a hundred times across and what not to relive the anxiety. They all worked! I remembered how stupid I was just a week back, when I was anxious, I used to just grab my jacket, change shoes, walk out into the balcony for a smoke, suffer the biting cold and come back to my desk feeling just as anxious. There were couple of instances when smoking did actually help me relax, but after reading Carr's book I know what was exactly happening inside my body.

So, the exam went really well yesterday, and I can't help but make the positive association of quitting smoking and doing well in an exam for the first time this semester! Of course, it is extremely ridiculous, but if I've spent so many years associating so many positive things that happened to me with smoking, then I'm going to just do the same with quitting smoking ;)

Thank you all for making it so easy this time around!

After 5 days I relapsed, and the whole week has been a relapse week. But here's to going at it again.

Last tuesday morning at work I had decided I'd had enough. I threw down my pack, stomped it nice and good and threw it out. I felt liberated as one day turned into two, turned into three and eventually 5. 

But after a weekend of controlling cravings and trying not to freak out on people, I caved.

I bummed a cigarette off of a friend at work with the old excuse: "I quit a few days ago but just want one to tie me through the night." Big mistake.

The next night was the same, going to be a one smoke night, until early in the morning when I bought a cheap pack because "I needed it and it was cheap". Fuck.

I did the same thing as before after a few cigs. Crushed the pack and threw it away.

Yet another time happened tonight. Cheap pack to hold me over until my weekend (an hour away) so I could try fresh after leaving work.

Another pack half smoked and now destroyed. 

I know I have better willpower than this. I was even starting to feel the positive effects and yet I caved. I felt disappoited that I had smelled like an ashtray for 5 years and never noticed. And with one crappy string of days I threw away a good string of healthy recovery.

I knew my weaknesses and caved. I knew the whole time when I was buying the packs or bumming just one that it was a bad idea. I feel weak.

But... Here's to round two. The final round. No more. I've had it. I want to be able to do things and not feel like dying, or worry about hiding things from people who don't know I smoked. 

Please let this be an inspiration that "just one more" will turn into "just oooone more". Then oh fuck you bought a pack.

I'm gonna do it this time.

Always get bedridden sick when quitting.

Over the past 4 years I've been at maybe 2 cigarettes a day. The highest I've been at was half a pack a day.    
    
 I'm in my late 20s but remember taking my first puff at 6 then gradually having it become a whenever-I-could-sneak-one-in habit at 8. So I honestly have no idea what it is like not having cigarettes in my life as they have been with me since I was a kid.  
       
I notice every time I try to quit I have no problems besides the common withdrawal symptoms. Around the 4-5th day I become extremely sick. Cold sweats, shaking, vomiting, fever, hallucinations, low blood pressure, fainting, dizzy, the whole works. It amazes me how addicted I still am after reducing to 2 cigarettes a day. Even worse, when I finally cave in and get a few puffs in, my body goes into overdrive on needing more and more and it becomes a worse need for more than 2 cigarettes a day then I've ever had. This even happens when I switch to ecigs.    
  I'm trying this out again with a new kind of ecig and hoping i won't get sick as a dog this time again. I'm on my second day which is supposed to be the hardest time but I'm fearing the end of the week. I can abstain from smoking as long as I don't get so sick that I can't go to work. Any suggestions?

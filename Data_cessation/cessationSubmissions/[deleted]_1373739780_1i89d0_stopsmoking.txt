The dreams

In my last post I included a post-script about the dreams I've had since quitting, but I thought they deserved a whole post. I've had several dreams when I've found myself buying packs and chain smoking in the dream. The entire time, I have this awful feeling of despair, somewhat unlike regular sadness or what I usually feel when I'm smoking. Anyway, I wake up and the fear hovers for a second before I feel a great relief. At first I was worried these would be recurring, but since then I really don't mind. All it does is remind me I've made the right decision. It's funny how we spend every waking second wishing we could quit when we're smoking, then as soon as we quit we are filled with worry and doubt. The fact that the little monster's following me into my dreams just tells me how desperate he's getting.

Day -1, and advice for the lurkers who are afraid to quit like I was.

Hi there! Long time lurker here...

So tomorrow is the day. I chose this day because I moved to a new city for a new job, which will start on Monday.

It may seem like a bad choice as it will probably be stressful, but:

- I'm starting a new life, and many things will change. It makes sense to me that the fact that I'm a smoker can change.
- I'm on champix (I think it's called chantix in the us), so the withdrawal symptoms should be mild. I started 1,5 week ago, and I think I already experienced them. So I'm probably good physically-wise.
- Hell, the perfect day never comes. I'll be busy and focused on Monday so it should be easy to forget about those damn cancer candies.


I'm also reading (for the 4th time) Allen Carr's book. If it didn't work for you, maybe reading it again will help, seriously I get a new perspective each time I read it.

It's in this book that I found **the advice I have for people who are not yet to the point where they decided to quit:**

1. This fear is the product of smoking. Once you will quit, this fear will be gone, and it's one of the best part of being smoke free. Non smokers don't have this fear.
2. The worse thing that can happento you  is... that you may quit smoking. I mean if you don't quit, nothing will change at all, so the only thing that can change is you being free and happy. Is that so bad?

I found that thinking of it this way is very helpful, so I wanted to share I this group.

Good luck! Soon we'll all be free like the others on this sub who make 5 years reports!

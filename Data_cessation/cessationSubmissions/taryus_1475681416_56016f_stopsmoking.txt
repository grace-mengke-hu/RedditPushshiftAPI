Been casually smoking for ~6 months, it's time to stop.

I've been going through a depressive period for a while and picked up this habit.  I've always hated it and never thought I'd do it myself. For me, I do it because it gives a relaxing headrush. 

It started out a couple of times per week, then once at the end of a tiring shift. Now it's twice or three times a day.  I noticed I only really get the urge to smoke at work. I've told myself many times that this would be the last pack, the last cigarette, but I just had a moment of realization.  I just bought another pack because fuck it, what's the harm in just one or two smokes per day, right? I was close to not doing it, but I caved.  I just had a smoke and realized that it doesn't really get me buzzed the way it used to. I don't want to go down this road and kill myself slowly. I know I'll get urges to smoke "just one" through the coming weeks, and that's the true challenge.  

I'm going to get rid of this pack. It ends here.

Panic attacks

It has been 8 days since my last cigarette. And all I can think about is how I don't want to do what I do for work and more. I'm an electrician apprentice and have only done it for one year out of a four year apprenticeship. I'm 25 with an associate degree I just am having thoughts that I have wasted so much of my life doing nothing and not knowing what I want to do. I'm just going crazy thinking about it. Is it normal to have this kind of anxiety during the quitting process? Thanks for the rant space. Stay strong every one.

Day 3...feeling weak

I am on day 3 of quitting, which most people say is the 3-day hump, and the hardest bit of quitting.  I have smoked since I was 16 and I am now 30.  Woof! It's been a long time....  I quit for 2 years before and was feeling great.  Then I took a trip to Europe with my wife.  It seemed like everyone smokes in Europe, even more than the US!  I started to casually smoke at clubs and with new friends while on vacation.  One thing lead to another and I was back to smoking full time (1/2-2/3 pack a day).  I woke up on Wednesday morning and said "Fuck this!" I have had trouble breathing at night and definitely winded during activities.  The problem is that this is the most stressful week at my job, architecture field.  We have an enormous deadline Friday (today), and my stress levels are so high that I am struggling to keep up the momentum of quitting.  I just had a tough moment where I actually had the cigarette in my mouth ready to light and then decided against it!  Not sure if I can make it through the day.  I know it sounds like an excuse, but my stress levels is the main reason that it has been so hard for me to quit after coming back from vacation with the wife.  Thanks for listening, really just needed to vent to random strangers on the internet.

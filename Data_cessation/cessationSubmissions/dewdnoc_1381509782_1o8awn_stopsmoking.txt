Look at that! I get a star with a number 2 in it!

Today marks 60 days for me without a Cigarette. My first two weeks were pretty rough, but I learned a few things about myself. Surprisingly, after the initial 3 days of withdraw, my biggest hurdle was coping with being free of the addiction. I never realized how much of what I did was dependent on smoking. Little things, like visiting a friend and going out to have a smoke to 'catch up' or stopping by the gas station every day to buy a new pack and get a snack. Even watching the clock while sitting at my desk waiting for my next smoke break. Really, it was like re-discovering life. Everything I had done over the past 11 years revolved (in a major way) around smoking. For me, quitting smoking (and any form of nicotine) changed my life. I feel empowered: I know if I can quit smoking I can do anything. I decided to combat the weight gain commonly associated with quitting and have started jogging 3 miles a day. I've lost 8 lbs, and hopefully by Christmas time I'll be at a weight I haven't seen seen in years. Thanks to everyone who provided support, and remember: If I of all people can quit, so can you! Just take a breath and remind yourself WHY your quitting, and you can do it!

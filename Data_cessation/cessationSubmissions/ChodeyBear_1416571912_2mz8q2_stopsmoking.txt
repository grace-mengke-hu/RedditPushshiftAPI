Life dragging me down + coming off the patches tomorrow

I'm taking my patches off tomorrow, hurrah! I'll have my mouth spray to gently bridge the gap for a couple of weeks before stopping that too. I'm excited but fed up of the constant bad mood that comes with stepping down, I totally get why people advocate cold turkey as it's probably quicker, but I'm not sure I could have dealt with the intensity. 

Life is getting me down, I've had constant situations testing my patience recently. People at work being arseholes, the fact that I have a completely incompetent counselling tutor, clients at work constantly demanding I do shit for them (to be fair, it is my job), some of my volunteers being unreliable, the list goes on and on. 

It's not perfect timing, but then it never will be and I have absolutely no urge to smoke, just need a few 'there there's to get me through :)

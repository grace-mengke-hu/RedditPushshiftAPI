Needing a serious start for this quit time now

I've been on this sub for a while during the many times ive tried to quit on and off. Today im deciding I wanna get serious and stop to go back to get my hands steady to start studying art again and for running. I miss them both so much which is why today I wanna start more than any other. I've stopped cigarettes but have been using a small vaporizer with high nicotine to get started but I wanna drop nicotine period. I started reading the book suggested by everyone by Allen Carr and have been vaping some less but am deciding enough with any nicotine period today. I'm wanting to ask if this book is really effective and I'm also gonna try some tea I found off amazon that was highly rated and wondering if anyone else has tried it to help kill cravings? Also if anyone has had any advice on staring to run again after stopping smoking at all?

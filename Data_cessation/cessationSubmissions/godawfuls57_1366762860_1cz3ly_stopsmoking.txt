Made it through the man trip.

Joe, my best friend served in the Air Force with me. Every so often, i travel out to PA to hang out and generally catch up. He was unfortunately kicked out of the USAF for weight gain even though the USAF took both of his knee's. it is customary as soon as i walk through his front door, a shot is poured and a cigarette or cigar prepared. This time is generally spent telling stories from our trip to Iraq, getting shot at, family and where our lives are now. i was sweating a million and one bullets at this point. And then the worst. Joe, who is 6'4 and right around 350 lb ( he's a brick shit house) came barreling up the stairs and said," to the truck!" ..... well of course i ran to the truck. we drove for only a few minutes but ended up at his campsite on the side of a mountain with a bonfire engaged (courtesy of a mutual friend) and three bottles of b-e-a-utiful moonshine on folding chairs by tents. shit........ three days of gun shooting, three days of shine, three days of temptation. I left for PA Saturday morning at 0730 and didn't make it home till today at 1250. i didn't smoke one cigarette. I'd be lying if i said this was easy, by god it wasn't. I'd also be lying if i said i didn't use my phone (alien blue) every time we went into town to get on this sub reddit and look for similar stories. i quit nicotine because i want a family. i quit nictoine because when i do have kids, i want to be able to run around our yard and not tote around oxygen. today I added my first badge, because now... i know i can do this. 

thank you all so very much.

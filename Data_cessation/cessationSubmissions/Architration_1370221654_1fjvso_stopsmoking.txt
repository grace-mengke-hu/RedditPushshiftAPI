I made it through the first 24 hours.

I didn't want to get a badge too early because I honestly wasn't sure I could make it past the first 24 hours. But I did. And it is the first time I have gone this long without smoking. I think I can do this, friends. I'm really losing my mind with cravings, but I think I finally have the confidence to make it happen. Awww yeah!

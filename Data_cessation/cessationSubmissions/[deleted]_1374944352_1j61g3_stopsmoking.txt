I know it's an old site and it's pretty ugly, but whyquit.com really helped me get through the first few days and continues to do so.

First I'd like to thank the sub for advice and motivation to quit. 

This helps me a lot.  Check out whyquit.com, there's a bunch of stories, videos and forum posts about quitting and it is pretty good info.  If not simply informative, it's motivational to not relapse.  The stories are terrifying and remembering some of the pictures and sadness helps with the tougher times.  

Best mantra from the site: "Not one puff.".  Sounds corny, but while hanging out in a group where everyone keeps going out for a smoke or at work where everyone is always smoking and my dumb brain says, "Just have 1; it'll be fine!".  It helps to think, "Not one puff." 

Hope this helps!

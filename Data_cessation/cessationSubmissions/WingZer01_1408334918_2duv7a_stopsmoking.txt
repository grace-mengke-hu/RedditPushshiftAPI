How to cope with the urge to smoke when driving.

I am going to try to quit, and smoke my last cigarette tonight. During past attempts, I could resist the urge when having coffee or a drink. However it always seemed to be that I would crack when driving. In another week, I will be unable to avoid a 45 or so minute commute on weekdays, but I can keep drives short for now. I can avoid coffee and alcohol which increase the urges, but I can't avoid driving. So I'm wondering what advice you all have. Thanks in advance.

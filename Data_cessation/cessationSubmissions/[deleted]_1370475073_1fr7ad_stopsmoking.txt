And I haven't caved. (Uplifting thread about tragedy, and not caving.)

I quit smoking four days ago. 
The first 48 hours were hard. I got really angry for no reason it seemed. 

Then it started to get super easy. Last night, my life flipped. You'd think with all sorts of trauma/tragedy happening at once, you'd cave right? 
Whats the biggest trigger for lighting up again? Stress. 

Here is how my day went yesterday.
-Phone call- 
"Your uncle got in a Motorcycle accident and is in ICU." 

That alone should make you want to smoke right? Don't even do it. Just deal with your situation. 

Then, I get in my car to do some shopping. I'm doing 60mph (in a 55) and I get cut off at an intersection. The guy blew the red light, I manage to slam the breaks and get the car to a comfortable 40mph before slamming into a tree. 

This is my first car, and I'm reeeallly broke right now. I took a ride home from a passer by I didn't know, because I was 30 miles away and don't know anyone here, and have no cell phone. 

No harm done to me, but it's turned my way of living around. I don't even have a grocery store in my town. That's 30 miles away. 

I didn't cave. I didn't smoke. 
I got wicked upset, and wanted a cigarette, but I knew if I started, it was just going to add the stress of wanting to quit later in life. 

If I can handle those stressers and not quit... So can you! 
Stay strong even in your worst day. 

Smoking isn't going to cure stress. I promise.

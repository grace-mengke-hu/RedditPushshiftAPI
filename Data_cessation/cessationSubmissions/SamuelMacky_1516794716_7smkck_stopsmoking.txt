Day 3, voice is 50% gone. [Cold Turkey]

I dong feel massively ill but my voice is starting to go and ive got a really bad blocked nose. What are you guys suffering with? 

Also, i know most people dont think its as simple as this, but for me ive mange to quit by just not smoking - sounds obvious but stops me needing any fancy expensive shit. As long as i dont have a cigarette im a non smoker.

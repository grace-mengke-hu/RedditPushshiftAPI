Hey, that's a star I have right there.

I just wanted to stop in and thank the /r/ for all of the encouraging stories and support I've read here over the past month. It really has helped.

To everyone who hasn't made it to where I am yet, just keep on trying! I've had good days, bad days and occasionally very bad days. Just keep telling yourself your one simple goal is to not smoke and eventually it gets easier!

Cheers.

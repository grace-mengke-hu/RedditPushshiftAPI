quitting smoking is like time traveling

Preparing next week to actually quit, so I did an experiment to see how bad withdraw would be by waiting till noon to smoke. Holy crap. Time has slowed so much. All I want is a cigarette I had no idea it would be this intense. I get up and walk, I  feel like time has gone by but it's only been a minute. Don't even get me started on the anxiety lol, I feel dizzy as hell. I feel like I'm in shitty Max Payne stuck in bullet time lmao. Jesus how did you guys get through it? I have to prepare for the next week somehow.

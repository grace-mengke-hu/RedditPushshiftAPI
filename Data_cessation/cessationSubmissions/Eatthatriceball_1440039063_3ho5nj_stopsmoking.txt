17 days and I'm feelin' myself

Hello wonderful people! Let me tell you how proud I am
of all of us! Can not believe it has been 17 days since I decided to quit- at this point I don't even think about cigarettes anymore. I am now focused on running- today I ran three miles and didn't have an asthma attack, woot woot.
It's funny seeing my co workers go out for smokes, then come back and try to mask the smell off their clothes with perfumes and cologne- can't believe I would do that too, and it doesn't even smell pleasant at all. I also started oil pulling to satisfy my oral fixation for a cig in the morning, my teeth are so pearly white now! 
My anxiety is also under control! Haven't had as many panick attacks since I stopped smoking- not sure if this has anything to do with anxiety, but whatever, I feel great! 
I just wanted to stop by and say, if I can do it, so can you! Distraction is key!! And after day three, it gets easier, TRUST ME. I was punching Snuffles the Panda plushie on my bed by day three, but we made up, phew! 
Hang in there guys!

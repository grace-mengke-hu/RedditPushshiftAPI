Just found this subreddit

Giving up cigarettes was one of the things I put on my 2015 to do list, but only really started making an active effort for about a week. I've gone from roughly 30 a day (Pack and a half) to about 4-8 a day. It has not been easy, and has made me a more difficult person to be around. I've tried in the past and failed, but am determined to see it through this time. Been smoking for about 15 years. I've found that marijuana helps a little, as I can get high and zone out on Netflix or video games for greater lengths of time and more easily tune out cravings. Advice and encouragement welcome.

Just checking in at 251 days, after my first completely smoke free semester, figured I'd answer any questions by those of us not quite as far out of the woods yet.

I'm proud to say I made it to this point, this is the longest I haven't smoked cigarettes since I first picked them up. 

I've got many problems in my life, and cigarettes were one of my solutions for a long time. Prior to my 20th birthday I realized that I needed to start the long process of shaping myself into the man I wanted to become, I was in the worst shape of my young life being about 20 pounds overweight, a smoker, and a drug dependent individual, failing school and social life following a long bout of depression and isolation.

I haven't conquered all my demons yet, but I managed to get a few of them under control, I'm getting school under control slowly, I lost the weight, and my social life has improved. I'm not about to pretend to you guys that I know where this is headed, but I think it's a good direction. Ask away if you guys have any questions for me.

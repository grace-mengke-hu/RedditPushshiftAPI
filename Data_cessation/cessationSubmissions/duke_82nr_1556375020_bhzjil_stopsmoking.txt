My first serious attempt going cold turkey - need your input on a long business travel.

This forum with all the success stories and that simple stop smoking app has really helped me stick to it. 

I just hit my 1 month mark and it’s feel great.

I travel quite a bit and an upcoming trip to China is freaking me out. I’m going to be around smokers all day and they show respect by drinking exotic tea and smoking fine tobacco. How do I sail past this ? I want to not smoke but also don’t want to come off rude with my hosts.

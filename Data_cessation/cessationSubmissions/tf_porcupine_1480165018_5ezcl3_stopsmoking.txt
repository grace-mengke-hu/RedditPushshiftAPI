Smoke free for 1 week! Never thought I had the guts.

So i was a 15-20 a day smoker for 3 years. Cigs ran my life, I had to plan everything to always find a place for a smoke in my schedule. I would go through anything to get my smoke, so I knew quitting would be hard - i was that hooked.

Two weeks ago I came home with cold, which is just about the only thing that lowers my appetite for smokes. I went to 3-5 a day for 3 days. That was when I thought I would try to quit ( altought I am going through the most stressful months in the last 5 years of my life) and now I am smoke free for 1 week already! First 3 days were super hard and there have been some tough situations during the week (football match, poker game where everyone smokes, night out), but I made it through.

What helped me ? Allen CarrÂ´s video set my mindset right. I bought an e-cig with nicotine-free juice for first months to cope with the "What do I do with my hands" habbit and to help me with resisting the triggers. I just get my e-cig whenever I feel like smoking. It feels nothing like a cigarette and there is no nicotine but it helps with the cravings a lot.

I feel so much better every day. Love this. Everyone keep strong and good luck. And get your badge, the fear of losing mine prevented me from giving in to at least 1 craving !

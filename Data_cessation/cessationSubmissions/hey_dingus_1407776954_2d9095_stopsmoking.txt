14 days!

Two whole weeks! What really helped me was going away for a family reunion for a week. I wasn't going to smoke around my family, so the second night I light up my last cigarette and decided that I just wouldn't buy another pack.  
  
For anyone reading this that wants to quit, if ever you have an opportunity to go away on vacation (or elsewhere) for a couple days, use that as a starting point for your quit. It's too good of an opportunity to pass up.

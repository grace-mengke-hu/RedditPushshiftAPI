Is this normal

Last night at work I had to leave. I've been smoke free for 3 weeks now and the stress after an hour at work gave me a panic/anxiety attack. I've never had one in my life. I couldn't breathe and was on the verge of having a complete meltdown. As soon as I got home (25 minute drive) I was fine for the most part. Still had some trouble breathing but that eventually subsided too. Has anyone else had this or something similar happen to them?

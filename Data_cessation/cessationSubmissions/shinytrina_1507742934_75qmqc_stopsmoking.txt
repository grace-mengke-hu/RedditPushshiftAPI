Feeling sick after visiting a client who smokes

I had an in home visit to do today and the person that I went to go see smokes.  Now he never smoked while I was in his apt, however, the windows were all closed and the place was 3 shades hotter than hell.  By the time I left I was feeling sick.  I was never so glad to get outside.  Still feeling sick almost an hour after leaving.  Reminds me of what I will never do to myself.

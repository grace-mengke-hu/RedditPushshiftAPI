Feel like crap. Ugh.

Hey everyone, I’m feeling a bit down right now. That might be an understatement. I’m 103 days into my quit, and this morning decided to partake in a little 420 action with a buddy (I’ve got the day off). My friend had what I thought was a just a regular ol’ joint, and asked if I’d want to smoke it with him. I’m a one hit kinda guy, so when I lit it up I took a pretty big drag. After inhaling, I immediately started hacking up a lung- my friend had rolled a spliff and failed to inform me that there was tobacco in it. I got a massive head rush and became really nauseous. Like I said before, I’m 103 days into my quit and this shit happens to me. Do I have to reset my clock now? I stopped smoking it after that one hit and now I’m feeling like complete shit. This sucks.

help with coping with smoking withdrawal symptoms

I am asking  this question in behalf of my father . he is 60 years and has been smoking for 31 years . he has tried to quit before but never succeeded. Now that he has retired and has loads of free time he is really trying to quit smoking. But after 2-3 days he is experiencing fatigue,headache. I am worried that he will return to smoking if this continues to  go on(he already a heart attack before though that may not be related to smoking but the doctors have told to stop nonetheless). What should he do to stop this and help with the cravings. For now he just consumes chewing gum when he feels like smoking.

Champix/ Chantix and mental health?

Hey, first time post here. I've been smoking for about 4 years and have tried (not very hard, I must admit) to quit a couple of times. I signed up for a quitting smoking study and this is how it works.

It's a double blind, so no one knows what I'm taking. I'll either be given nicotine patches and placebo pills, Champix pills and placebo patches, or placebo patches AND placebo pills. 

I've heard very good things about Champix, as both my brother and father used it years ago. However, Google has scared the hell out of me.

I won't know if I'm taking it, which is scary. I have a history of depression and anxiety, but the depression was years ago. I sitll have anxiety, but it's not too bad anymore.

Should I pay attention to these horror stories? Many of them are from like 2007, very few from the last year.. I'm just nervous, I suppose. I heard about people comitting suicide out of no where and psychosis and hallucinations.. Scary stuff.

Should I go through with the study? It's a good motivator to quit and I also get paid.

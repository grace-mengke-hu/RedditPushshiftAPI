Bought a pack. When will this end.

So after going a day without smoking, I ended up having a piece of nicotine gum when I began feeling the worst of the withdrawals.  2 hours later I was at my father's house (he smokes) and bummed one off of him

On my way home, I bought a pack.  I can't even begin to express how angry I am.  I almost didn't even want to come here and post.  I am starting to think that there really is no easy answer to my smoking addiction.  It comes down to me.  No piece of gum or any NRT substitute is going to do it for me.

I have to do it.  But I have failed so many times it makes me sick. Why am I even posting this?  

Anyway, I will try again to quit.  I don't know if I should just throw away this pack or smoke the whole thing.  Anyway guys, thanks for all of the support and guidance.  But I know deep down this comes down to me, there is no internet forum, NRT, vaping device, or anything else which is going to magically cure me.  Its likely going to be a difficult road no matter what route I choose to quit, including cold turkey.  So I might as well accept it.

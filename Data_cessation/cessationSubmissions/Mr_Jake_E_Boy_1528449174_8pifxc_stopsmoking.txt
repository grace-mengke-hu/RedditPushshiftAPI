What to Do When Not Smoking?

Hi Reddit,

I will try to keep this short, if you take the time to read it, then thank you. 

I have been successfully smoke free for a week now and as such have saved $130.90 (Australia taxation is honestly disgusting).
Previously was smoking 17-20 cigarettes a day, mid strength (blue)

I keep having these moments of freedom where i dont have any pressing tasks. Id like to relax but the first thing id always do before any enjoyable activity would be have a cigarette. Also when i was bored or even having a great time. My brain tries to convince me i miss the feel of inhaling smoke in my lungs too and that despite the cost and health risks i am depriving myself. I conciously know this to be false and that, that is the drug addiction talking. This leads me to my TLDR.

TLDR: Seem to have replaced smoking with drinking. As a non active person, what can i do instead of smoke to fill the "void" of not smoking?

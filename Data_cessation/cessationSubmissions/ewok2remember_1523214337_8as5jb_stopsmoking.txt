Needing a few pointers.

I've recently quit smoking, and I'm doing fairly well managing cravings. What I can't manage are the fast mood swings. When I'm by myself, it's no problem. But I find myself too often becoming short with my wife and child, and with very little awareness until after the fact. Does anyone have any tips on how to manage this?

4 Visuals That Help Explain Smokers Cough & Quitting Timelines

I was totally unprepared for the amount of coughing, phlegm, chest tightness, and lung congestion that came after my quit. Now I'm finally facing the effects of my light smoking, a month after I quit. I had no idea! 

I'm a visual learner, so I wanted to share some videos and links I found helpful when researching WTF is going on with me. 

1. Ask Harvard Medical School - why am I coughing more? Cilia regrowth diagram. https://youtu.be/7ONpUoDmZ-M

2. Bronchoscopy of Healthy Lung, and tissue sampling. Visual starts at about 3:45 https://youtu.be/KqZc1JqArco
(Fun fact- stabbing the lung causes no pain because there are no pain receptors in lungs. My notion of being aware of lung health via discomfort was totally wrong.) 

3. The smoking lung - what happens after 60 cigarettes. https://youtu.be/tCdOAzyKplM

4. Map of bronchoscopy and anatomy of breathing airways. Helped me understand what all the quit timelines were talking about. https://youtu.be/ThYHLG50pH0

Allen Carr's book was the reason I able to quit weeks 1-3. Never experienced any noticeable health effects from smoking, just needed justification to quit. 

These cleansing symptoms and health side effects I'm experiencing firsthand now are why I'm never having another smoke. 

TL;DR check out the links about to see what the cough after you quit is trying to cleanse.

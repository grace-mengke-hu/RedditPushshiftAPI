Is it better to quit smoking cold turkey or slowly smoke less?

I recently quit smoking, and its one of the hardest things I've done. Right now its all I think about and I'm right on the verge of starting up smoking again. Are the cravings worse when you quit cold turkey rather than slowly smoking less? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, because I'm having a really tough time. Thanks in advance, guys.

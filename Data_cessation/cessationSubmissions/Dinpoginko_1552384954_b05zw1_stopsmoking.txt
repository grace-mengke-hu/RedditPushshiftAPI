I broke my record of 5 month

last night it was raining and it was really cold so i took mother chicken with her babies and put them into a box so they dont fell cold. And they are pretty happy inside box i closed box but let it open a little. but when i woke up in morning and happily went to checked on them they were all dead becuase box got fully closed and they all died inside of it. I had raised her from when she was just a little chick i got really sad and for 20 minute i was just hitting her so maybe she might start breathing again. I kept sighing and almost cried there was noway to make this sadness go away so i just went out bought a pack and starting smoking. I know all of you are going to hate me for this  but i loved them more than anything i watched her everyday until she hatched her eggs i wanted to keep them warm from cold. I really loved her but because of my stupidity she died. I deserve hate.

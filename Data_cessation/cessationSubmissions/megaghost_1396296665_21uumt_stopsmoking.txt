Today is my last day

I'm not relying on tomorrow being special due to ceremony or anything else, I just like to have an easy to remember date to recall while I count. Either way, I'm done after today. I'm quitting for my wife, my unborn child, for my stepson, for my mother, for my father, for my sister, my niece and my dead grandparents. Mostly though, I'm quitting for me. It's been nearly 20 years and I'm too old for this shit. There's nothing that makes it worth it.

Questions about herbal cigarettes.

   ***D I S C L A I M E R :*** I am well aware that anything (within reason) will do some form of harm to an individuals respiratory/circulatory system when smoked. I ask that you please save your "any type of smoke is bad" comments... I get it.

   I'm a 21 y/o that has been smoking three packs of No. 27's every week for the last 5-ish years. Recently, my aunt quit smoking herself and gave me a few packs of organic mullein cigarettes to try. Much to my surprise, they are the ONLY thing i have smoked during the past 8 days. I had some serious withdraw symptoms during the first three (from the lack of nicotine I assume), but I haven't touched any type of tobacco or nicotine product since. But now I'm down to one pack of the mullein cigarettes so I'm currently contemplating if I should improve the concept further by rolling my own herbal cigarettes or if I should try cold turkey. If I stick with the herbal cigarettes for a bit longer, I will use a legal herb (besides tobacco) and some [very thin cigarette papers](https://www.amazon.com/ELEMENTS-Ultra-Rolling-Paper-Leaves/dp/B0066WG7VW) to minimize the cumulative pollutants as much as I can. But sadly, almost every forum/article relating to herbal cigarettes that I've seen told me either **(A):** They cure cancer and turn you into superman. OR **(B):** You will die the instant you look at one. *Obviously* I'm exaggerating, but the posts supporting and rejecting their use are very close in number. So i'm sure many people like me are left with more questions than answers.

   -The first question that came to mind was: 
      Should I include a cigarette filter in my herbal cigarettes? Or will I be better off just throwing in [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/Raw-Rolling-Papers-Unbleached-Filter/dp/B005JFFY02/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?
      ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515410282&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=joint+crutch) instead? Im not concerned with taste or feel of the smoke, I simply want to know if one causes more harm than the other. 

   -I *really* hope someone reading this is smart, because my second question is a little more difficult to answer:
      An individual collects some pure tobacco, mullein, skullcap, sage, and green tea leaves, each herb is organic and dried/cured perfectly. The individual then places an exact gram of each herb in different airtight 
      containers and burns them (the containers started out with more than enough fresh air to complete the reaction). When the herb has burned completely, which container will have the largest carbon monoxide %? 
      Also, which container will have the highest % of polluted air in general?
   
   To reiterate, I am fully aware that anything I might smoke will produce carbon monoxide and other pollutants that will do some form of harm to my body. I just want to know if certain herbs will produce more or less than others. 

   Also, it's worth noting that the main reason i started smoking in the first place is simply the act of smoking itself. I can't put into words why, but **IMO** the feeling of exhaling smoke is one of the most satisfying things in the world. That being said, I *do* have the intent to quit smoking completely. But I believe that if i can find a way to stop my nicotine addiction first, I'll have a much easier time ending my smoking habit altogether. Is that logic flawed?

A big thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and respond! 

EDIT 1: Sorry if this post isn't suitable for [r/stopsmoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/). I couldn't think of any other sub to ask.

EDIT 2: **TLDR**, is it worse for you to have a filter in cigarettes? And does all dried plant matter produce equal amounts of carbon monoxide.

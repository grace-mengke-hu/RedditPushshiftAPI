Every second is eternity. I have lost interest in my hobbies. I am hungry 24/7

I decided to take a big plunge cold turkey. I am on day 5. I quit smoking cigarettes AND went on a strictish diet at the same time.  Sometimes I have moments of clarity, but most of my day is spent living on 3 worlds at the same time. Fidget fidget fidget fidget! 

It feels terrible. I'm hoping withdrawal is gone soon. I can't seem to calm myself long enough to do any of my hobbies. 

I end up going to bed mad early every night b/c it's better than being awake hungry and niccing.

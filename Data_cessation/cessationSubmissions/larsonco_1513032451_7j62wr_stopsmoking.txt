Quit smoking after Bronchitis

Hey everybody; I've quit smoking after 10 days of pretty nasty bronchitis.  I smoked off and on (albeit less) through the first four days of the sickness, but, was able to quit.  I've been over the majority of the sickness since Friday (four days-ish) and still haven't smoked!  The biggest thing I noticed was that I can smell cigarette-smoke on my friends and coworkers--I can't wait to start cooking and eating again and see what food really tastes like!

PS I'm using an app called "smoke free" which tracks how long I've been smoke-free, how many cigs I haven't smoked, how much money I've saved, improvements to my health, etc--It gives me daily missions--today's mission was to come on here and read testimonials and I'm so glad I did, because it's made me smile and cry! Cheers!

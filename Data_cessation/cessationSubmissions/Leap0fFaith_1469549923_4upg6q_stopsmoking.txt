That first day...

I don't understand how you guys make it past that first day. Something fucked up keeps happening that triggers me to not being able to handle my shit. I'm trying to go cold turkey. Sunday, 6 hours in, my work truck breaks down me. I'm stranded over 3 hours. Literally broke down across the street from a gas station. Go in to get something cool to drink. In my rage I bought a pack. Yesterday, flush what remained of failure pack. I made it 7 hours before I couldn't handle my shit and broke. Those stressful situations that life throws have become my trigger. I'm nic'ing, I'm stressed out, is leading to a perfect storm of 'fuck it.' How do you guys get through stressful situations when you are going through the grinder of having a nic fit?

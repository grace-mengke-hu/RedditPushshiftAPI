KEEP GOING

I'm at 2502 days, so just shy of 7 years now.  I periodically check in and browse the sub a bit here and there.  I see a lot of newbies and I get excited.  I don't see many old timers posting, but I thought I'd just chime in real quick.

It's now been so long since I smoked, I can't really remember being a smoker.  I quit when I was 23, a week before my 24th birthday, so it's not like I'd been smoking forever.  This  anniversary will mean I've been a non-smoker about as long as I was a smoker (assuming we just count my life from when I picked up that shitty habit at about 16).  Hell, I'm no longer a "non-snoker;" now, I just "don't smoke."

It gets so much easier over time.  Temptations fade away.  You find new activities or hobbies to fill the gap.  You save so much money (seriously, I now invest all of the money I used to spend on cigarettes).  Food tastes better, so you gain weight from eating, but the you work out more and your stamina goes up (though you probably won't lose ALL of your new food weight haha).  You even make new friends that aren't smokers.  Your family will probably still smoke, but eventually you won't get cravings if you're near them while they're smoking.

I'm not here to brag, I just want to say that things get better and you will absolutely thank yourself in the long-run.  Please keep kicking ass!

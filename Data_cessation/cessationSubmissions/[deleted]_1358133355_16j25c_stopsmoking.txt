After 15 years, I'm on day 4....

Bought an e-cig on Wednesday last week. Had my last smoke Thursday night. It's now Monday afternoon (where I am) and I still have 7 or 8 proper cigarettes left in a packet that I didn't even look at all weekend - completely happy with my e-cig. My husband is still smoking properly and even being around him smoking (in the car, etc) isn't bothering me. Thought my downfall would be smoking with a beer but one beer was fine - more than that, perhaps, and I'll notice a difference....

This is the only time I have ever attempted to quit in 15 years (I'm 31 now) and the longest I have gone without a real cigarette in that time - I have always been that person saying I'M NEVER QUITTING, I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE SMOKING - but I suddenly just decided to do it last week. Out of the blue. For me, the *real* addiction is the ritual of having a cigarette, so the e-cig suits me down to the ground.

I'm actually starting to think that I prefer the e-cig!! Can smoke at my work desk ;)

If you're like me, and it's the whole ritual of smoking that you love most, then I could not recommend an e-cig more.

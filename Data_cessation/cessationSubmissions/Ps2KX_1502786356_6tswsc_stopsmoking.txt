14 days coming up!!

I must say, I did not expect to last this long. So far stopping has been easier and in some ways harder than I expected.

The urges can still be quite intense but I keep remembering: I can start smoking again every time I like... but also remember that I will have to deal with these two weeks again.. and more intense.

With the exception of a few times a day, I don't even miss it anymore.

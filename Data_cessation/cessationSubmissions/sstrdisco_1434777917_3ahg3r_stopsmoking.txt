Faced a new trigger this week and won!

Camping and smoking, the two always went hand in hand for me. Went camping, a quick over-nighter, yesterday and was fine. There were three of us, and only one person was a smoker. I was really surprised that I did not have a craving for a cig. So yeah, faced that and just had a nice time :)

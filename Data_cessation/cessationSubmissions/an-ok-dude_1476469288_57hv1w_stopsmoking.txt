When do you know you won?

After chewing about 6 cans a week for 14 years. I decided enough is enough. I did two 2 days of 21 mg nicotine patches, 2 days of 14, and 2 days of 7, I'm currently 11 full days of zero tobacco. For the most part I'm fine now, but it seems like once a day I still have extremely strong cravings followed by extreme exhaustion. When does it fade?

This is brutal.

Nicotine Substitutes and your thoughts

Hey guys, I've been a smoker for 15 years and this is my 3rd time quitting. Unlike the last times I'm using gum, blu e-cigs and a supportive girlfriend.

Before I never saw the benefits of nicotine substitutes but this time I'm giving them a try. Today is day 3 and I'm having a hard time not going out and buying a pack; I'm also running low on my e-cigs.

I guess I wanted to ask the community how you guys feel about using nicotine substitutes vs going cold turkey and if anyone had any advice for me about using substitutes. Thanks guys!

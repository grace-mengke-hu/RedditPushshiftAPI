Using Chantix

Hi all. So I fell off the wagon pretty hard a while back and it just hasn’t stopped. I hate so much all of the sneaking out to smoke, hoping I don’t smell, hoping I can get back to my desk (and my hand sanitizer and body spray) before someone stops me and notices I smell like an ashtray. 

So with all of that being said- I know this sub leans heavily toward the cold turkey method, but I wanted to know if anyone has used Chantix and what experiences you have had with it. I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow, and I’m planning to ask about it. So any input or personal experience would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!

It's not the first time I quit, but I am confident it will be the last.

I was planning on quitting October first, but I didn't have my last cigarette until five days later.   Those few days had some weak moments while I attempted to go cold turkey.  The real problem I had was the system I created for myself at work.  I used a cigarette break as a reward for getting my work done.  I was enjoying my smoke breaks too much, and that is what made it hard to quit while I was at work.  I had to replace that feeling.

For the first two weeks, I bought two disposable, flavoured vaporizer pens, and continued to treat my breaks as rewards for completing my tasks.  I went outside and puffed on the vaporizer, which contained no nicotine, and watched the smoke leave my mouth.  This really worked for me as the motions gave me comfort and my workdays had the same pacing as if I still smoked cigarettes.  As I came upon the two week mark, I didn't buy another disposable vaporizer, but I continued to go outside for some of my breaks as I got used to giving up that practice altogether.

After a week or more of no longer practicing my reward ritual that I was so accustomed too, I feel that any cravings or desire to smoke is getting lesser and lesser every day.  I do have moments where I find myself wondering if I sure have a cigarette, but then I quickly remind myself of how well I am doing and to put it out of mind.

I am going to do my best to avoid cigarettes for as long as I can, and if I have one while I drink with friends, I am not going to beat myself up.  I am just not going to let myself get into a habit.  In fact, I am going to do well with avoiding any negative habits altogether.

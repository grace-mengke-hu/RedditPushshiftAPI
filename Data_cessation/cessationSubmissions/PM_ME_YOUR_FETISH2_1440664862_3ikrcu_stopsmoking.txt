36 hours in. Will constantly update thread.

I'm quitting for health reasons. I wasn't a huge smoker. A pack would normally last me 4 days to a week but it is still smoking. I've had minimal cravings so far. My friend who was a heavier smoker is also quitting and is having a tough time. He said he got cravings 4 hours after. I'm also quitting drinking, because drinking leads to smoking for me and vice versa. Wish my luck. I'll post back in 12 hours or so.

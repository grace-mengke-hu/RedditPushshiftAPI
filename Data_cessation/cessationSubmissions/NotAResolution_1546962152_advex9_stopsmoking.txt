18 years old, ridiculously addicted to vaping. I know I need to stop.

So this isnt really a new years resolution, but I've been vaping for about four years, addicted for two. Like everyone else, it starts off as something cool to do at parties with no nicotine, then one day I decided I'd buy a bottle of 3mg, then 6mg, then one day the variety store only had 18mg, and then juuling and 50mg nic salts came out, and before you know it, the second I woke up I needed my vape immediately. That's the stage I'm at right now, but today I woke up feeling a little different.

I feel like I have no willpower at all. I've tried to quit before, but everyone around me has a vape so it's so easy to just ask someone for a hit. Woke up this morning and decided to take an Ibuprofen instead of vaping but I'm only like 3 hours in and feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. Could use some tips.

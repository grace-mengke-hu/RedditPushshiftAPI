Another reason to quit smoking, more time! But what do I do with it?

I've been trying to quit smoking (currently on day 11) and the one big thing I've noticed is how much more free time I have. I smoked a pack a day, and each smoke took 4-5 minutes, so all the sudden I have an extra 1-2 hours in my day. When at work I'm just able to get more work done, but at home I find myself more bored than usual. What are you guys doing with your extra free time, if anything?

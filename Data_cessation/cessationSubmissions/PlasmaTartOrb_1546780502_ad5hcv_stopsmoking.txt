What to reward myself with during a study break?

Hi all,

To all new quitters this January: keep it up! It gets easier :)

Since I've quit smoking, nearly two years ago, I've really missed the cigarettes during study breaks. It feels like it affects my concentration a lot. I try to use the pomodoro technique and used to reward myself with a quick cigarette break. Nowadays however, I don't know what to reward myself with, so it seems less effective. I can only take a few cups of coffee an candy isn't a good alternative either. Browsing for a reward seems dangerous too, because of the sucking in effect.. Has anyone noticed this too? What did you find helpful?
Thanks so much!

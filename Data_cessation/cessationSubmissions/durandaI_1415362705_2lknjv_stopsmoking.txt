I had a dream last night...

I quit both smoking and drinking within a week of each other (around 3 months ago), and it's been messing with my sleep ever since (insomnia, vivid dreams, recurring dreams, etc).

Anyway last night I had a dream that I was out with friends on the beach in Chile somwehere and I decided that, because it was a dream, I'd have a cigarette.

And then I thought, "You know what, better not even smoke this dream cigarette, because then I'd have to reset my badge on reddit and I don't really feel like doing that".

This may just be my subconscious telling me that I'm spending too much time on reddit. Or it might mean I'm actually committed to this. Either way, I wanted to share. 

Oh, and hey, it's been over 3 months! Cool.

day three and a pleasant surprise

day 3: wake up, curse the skies, cry a little bit over something super trivial (for real though) and then brush my teeth. 

I went to do my normal tongue scraping, and realized the blanket of yellowy plaque I usually scrape off my tongue each day and night was GONE. goodbye, tongue sweater! I hated you. I still hate you. don't come back.

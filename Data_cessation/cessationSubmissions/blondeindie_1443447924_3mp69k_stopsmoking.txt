Boyfriend is quitting smoking and gets crazy night sweats. Any suggestions?

It's been about two weeks of no cigarettes at all. He started quitting over a month ago, but the last cig was two weeks ago.  Almost every night, he wakes up with intense night sweats. I'm proud of him for quitting. I want to support him the best I can. I know that he's having a hard time sleeping due to the sweats. Does anybody have any tips for this? How long do they normally last? Thank you!

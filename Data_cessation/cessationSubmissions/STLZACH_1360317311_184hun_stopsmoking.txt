When do things get better? (Update-ish?)

I posted here a few weeks ago after I had quit and had a lot of problems with rib/chest discomfort, and extreme anxiety issues. 

My doctor prescribed medication for my anxiety but sometimes it doesn't seem to even work, and I get really stressed out--Like, grown man crying stressed out. 

I have a lot to be happy about, I'm young and things are just starting to get fun in my life but I just can't stop thinking and it's getting really hard to sleep at night.

I just want to know if these symptoms normally last this long or if I'm ever going to feel not shitty about everything ever again. I don't even have urges to smoke at all, that part of my life is behind me but I'm having a really hard time with the side effects. Should I look into getting a patch or something? What are the pros/cons of patches? What about e-cigs?

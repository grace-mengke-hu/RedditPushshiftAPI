One Month

Cold Turkey.

I feel super proud of myself. I really did not expect to see myself get through an entire month going cold turkey. I thought I'd have relapsed before I hit the one month mark.

But I didn't.

And I persevered. I battled through the awful cravings I had for the first week, I battled with myself when I went to peoples houses that do smoke, and see them light one up in front of me.

Now, every time I refuse a smoke, it's a small victory for myself.

Advice to people currently quitting or looking to quit, it does get easier. The first week sucks hard, but it gets easier everyday. I promise.

Just wanted to share.

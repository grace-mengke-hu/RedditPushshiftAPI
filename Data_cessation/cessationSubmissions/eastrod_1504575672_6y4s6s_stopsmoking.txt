reset to day 1 but not giving up!

Made it to 3 weeks up until yesterday. Had a rough weekend, held out through a flat tire episode on Saturday but by last night and a few other stressful situations, I caved. The worst part is, I knew I didn't need it but wanted it anyway. 

Regardless, after beating myself up most of the day today, I have decided that I still the desire to quit and stay quit this time. 

Resetting to day one but still better than giving up!

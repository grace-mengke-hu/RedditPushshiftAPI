The urge continues...

Going on 8 weeks no darts after 20+ years, no cheats either. Having a few drinks tonight and for whatever reason I'm being hit with wave after wave of cravings. That little voice, "just a puff, it doesn't have to be a whole smoke, hey there's cigars you haven't touched yet..." and so on.
The little voice and cravings get easier to deal with everybody, dont give in to them!

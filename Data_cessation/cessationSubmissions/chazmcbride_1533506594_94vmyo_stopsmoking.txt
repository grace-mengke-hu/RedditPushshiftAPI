42 days deep. Pretty decent week. I feel like my focus is coming back. Normal cravings which are easier to push away, although every time I walk past someone smoking I do miss it. I don’t know why I miss it because let’s be honest there is nothing to miss. I am definitely loving coffee more for sure

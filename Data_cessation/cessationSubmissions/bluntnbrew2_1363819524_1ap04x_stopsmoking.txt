Made first account for this

Well, I've been smoking solidly for about three years.  It started off with buying a corncob pipe oddly enough.  I saw Gandolf puffing on his pipe in the fellowship and decided to go buy a pipe myself. It progressed from there with a mixture of cigars and eventually cigarettes. I smoked about a pack a day. I feel like it got deeply intertwined to who I am as a person by smoking with my gf from highschool. We hid it from our parents together, cruised while listening to music together, and had really meaningful discussions while chainsmoking the whole time. Well, we broke up after three years together. I ended up in a possible depression scenario...I was valedictorian at my high school. I went from a great nationally recognized university to a state school to a community college after we broke up. I just couldn't bring myself to go to class, and I couldn't stop smoking. I also picked up smoking marijuana on a daily basis. 

We broke up seven months ago, and I still think about her. Still kind of in a fog. Even now as I type this. Buuuuut...

 I've stopped smoking the weed just because my level of use was abuse. And after a seemingly infinite number of times of trying to kick the nicotine, I think I'm done. Smoked my last one this morning. And with that hopefully ill start to feel more whole. Less like a zombie. I still feel like somethings wrong upstairs but I know I don't want to smoke and need to quit. I know that, and I know I used to be intelligent. Im hoping I can just follow that voice in my head and get back to being me. Thanks for reading if anyone does, and I apologize for my incoherence in this post.

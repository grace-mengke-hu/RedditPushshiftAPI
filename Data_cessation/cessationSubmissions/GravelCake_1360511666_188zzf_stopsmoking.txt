Stopping after 2 years. Have some questions for you all.

Background story: Been smoking for 2 years (ages 26-28, did not smoke at all during teenage years). Last 6 months I have averaged a pack a day.

Today, I was on the treadmill for the first time in about 4 months. I can usually do 30 minutes at a good pace, no problem - I get tired, but that's the point isn't it? This time, it took 20 minutes until I felt that I couldn't get enough air. I could breathe, but it was a very real physical sensation that I didn't have enough lung volume to satisfy each breath. Add to that dry coughing and a sudden, general lethargy.

It's about 1 hour ago since I was on the treadmill, and my breathing is back to normal. But for a while there, I felt a **panic** that I have never felt before.

So: Enough is enough. I am quitting cold turkey, now. No cigs left in the house either, so good timing I guess.

Questions:

* Having smoked regularly for "only" 2 years. How will my cravings stack up against those who have smoked for say 10 years, or through their teens? Will it be an easier/quicker process?
* What is the most difficult thing about quitting?
* What is the most rewarding thing about quitting?
* Finally: How long, with very light cardio 5 times a week, will it take before I start noticing an improvement in my cardiovascular system?

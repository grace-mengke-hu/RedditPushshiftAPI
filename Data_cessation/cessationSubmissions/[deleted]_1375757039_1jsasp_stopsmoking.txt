Is it normal to still be anxious a month after quitting?

My anxiety has been progressively getting worse, to the point where I'm almost unable to function. I thought that the withdrawal was supposed to have been finished by now, or at least gotten better - I'm in a worse state now than I was at the supposed peak on day 3. Do I just need to stick it out some more? If so, how long?

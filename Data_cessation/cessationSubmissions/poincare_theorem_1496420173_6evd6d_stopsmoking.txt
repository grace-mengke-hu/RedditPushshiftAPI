Uranium

My brain slips into the room and leans against  me 'Psst.... feel that empty incompleteness? Your missing something!' 


'Yes' I reply, 'my health after twenty years of smoking.'


'No no man you just need another cigarette! Promise last one! Just to celebrate your quit! A sneaky cheeky one. No one will ever know! You've proved you can control it, we could have just one a night. A treat!'


'Do I look like an idiot!? Should I inhale some uranium as well?!! No. Because no one would inhale cancer causing chemicals for fun, and pay money for  it! Take your cancer sticks and go away!'



I didn't smoke yesterday. I didn't smoke today. I damn well won't smoke tomorrow.

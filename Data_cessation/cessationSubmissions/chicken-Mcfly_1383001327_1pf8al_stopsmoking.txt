Smoking in my dreams

Hey guys

well this is what happens. a few nights ago was asleep and in my dream I saw myself smoking. 
This is wierd, since I've been 28 days without smoking and seriously I feel good, I started to play sports and run, and finally the insesable cough its over. I don't feel anxiety anymore. then why is this happening??? what does it means??

This sub feels like my only friend right now

I want to start off by thanking everyone here and saying that am sorry if I'm using this sub wrong I just feel like I have no where else to turn. I currently attend college and I live with my girlfriend who made me quit smoking. Since stopping I've realized how critical she is and how much she runs me down. I think I used to cope with the constant digs by smoking. Also, without smoking and calling people, or going to my smoking friends house, I realize how little I actually talk to people. I have this fear that I only called people out of habit and that they genuinely don't want to talk to me. I just feel very isolated and while I thought quitting would bring me closer to my girlfriend and parents who pushed me constantly, instead I feel more alone. I don't want to smoke again because I've learned this has to be  for me now, but I've never been this depressed in my life. Is this a symptom of withdraw or am I just seeing things clearly for the first time?
**TL:DR Quitting smoking has shown me not that I want to keep smoking, but that I really just don't love my life**

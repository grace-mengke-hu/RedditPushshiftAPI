Day 4: 100% Nicotine Free but the temptations don't stop.

This morning when I woke up, my first thought was "I did it! 72hrs down & the nicotine is out of my system" & it felt amazing just to know that. I noticed that I'm extra phlegmy this morning & I'm thinking that's my body saying "ok, she was serious, guess it's time to start pushing this shit out". Knowing that I'm already getting healthier is a big motivator to keep going. That is the train of thought I woke up to & I felt nothing but strong in my convictions BUUUUTTTTT.... upon getting out of bed to let the dogs out, I see the pack of ciggs my friend carelessly left on my table. The evil little nicotine fiend in me instantly re-doubles in size & suddently I feel like I will explode. Split-instant mood swing. And the monster inside me is telling me "your friends passed out on the couch, powerless to stop you mwahahaha" and "one cigg won't kill you, you can stop again right away" and "the weather is beautiful, it would just feel so good to go sit in the sun & smoke ONE cigarette" and about a million other things in the timespan of about a second. Then I made a determined move & slowly repeated to myself what I said when I woke up... I DID IT. 72 HRS DOWN. THE NICOTINE IS OUT OF MY SYSTEM. and remembered how proud I was just a minute ago & I quieted the monster. This is the worst craving I've had so far. I'm so happy I took the time to talk myself down & I will think back to it the next time the monster shows itself. 


TL;DR: kicked the nicotine cold turkey & it's out of my system. Had a massive mood swing & craving but didn't light up. yay for me!

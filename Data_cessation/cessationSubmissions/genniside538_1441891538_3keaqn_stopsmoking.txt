My Last Summer of Cigarettes is Officially Over [rant]

Background: I went to school in St. Louis, and back in '08, you could smoke in bars and indoors and that kind of fun stuff. I was a stoner, I loved to party, so I quickly picked up smoking cigs and brought the bad habit home to Boston. That was 7+ yrs ago.

I got my MPH at BU. At BU I met [Dr. Michael Segal](http://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/michael-siegel/). He played a major role in the CA legislation to ban smoking from indoor establishments because it violated worker's rights, health and safety. He did a great job of separating the facts from fiction regarding cigarette's, and I walked away from the class with one goal: quit smoking before 30.

For the most part, if you quit smoking before 30, and never touch tobacco again, the risk for many cigarette related diseases goes down to levels of a never-smoker. He taught me that smoking at a young age isn't a death sentence *as long as you actually quit*.

So I spent the last year knowing that I was turning 29 and that the next 365 days would be focused on quitting, ensuring that I would never pick up a stick again by 30. And sure enough, labor day happened...

Summer casual dress code at work ended. I'm back to my monkey outfit (suit and tie). And I'm not smoking.

Its been what, almost 60 hrs? And my head hurts. There's so much pressure and stress in my jaw. I can't focus on shit. I'm irritated and feeling really stubborn. junk in my throat is coming up. I feel like I'm about to start bawling at my desk...

but I haven't smoked

I haven't bought a pack

I haven't bummed a cig

And I don't care that I'm miserable. I DON'T CARE!! I have to be miserable in order to get through this. It's part of the process. I can accept that. 

But fuuuuuck...I can't believe how hard this is. addiction is a bitch guys...a fucking troll

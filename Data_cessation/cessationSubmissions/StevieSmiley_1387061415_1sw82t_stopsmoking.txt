broke new ground... well kinda.

Yesterday I had a very unnerving experience of vertigo and found myself pretty much laying on the ground. I've never experienced this type of sensation, and it scared me shitless. It was like my head being on a rollercoaster and with it a bit of weakness. It lasted for about 15 seconds and i practically passed out. The closest I've ever came to this in the past has been an equilibrium imbalance I frequent, which is generally a feeling that my head just tilted. In fact, when it started, this was what I thought it was. Anyway. It so happens that my mother also experienced such recently (its been suggested to check for co , which we've done but not have discovered anything )

Anyway, you're probably wondering how this relates to smoking. As unnerved as I was, my first reactions had nothing to do with smoking. In fact it barely surfaced as the proper thing to do and I quickly calmed down and relaxed - very unlike when I smoked and was constantly on edge til I had one or 2 or 3.

Sure, this stress related issue is pointed out constantly. But there's nothing quite like experiencing something like this first hand. It just seems to reinforce my own commitment and totally convinced myself  that I'm done.

As for the vertigo itself, I'm really hoping it was just a random occurrence  or that we do find it was indeed co. If it happens again though, I'm definitely  going to the hospital - insurance or not.

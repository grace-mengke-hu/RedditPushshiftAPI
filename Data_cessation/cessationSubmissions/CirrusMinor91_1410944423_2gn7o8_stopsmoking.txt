starting trying

Hello fellow redditors. it has been on my mind for some time that i should quit smoking. I am 24 y/o and been smoking for the last 9 years. when i first started smoking i was just a kid, doing it because my friends did it and because i liked the social aspect of it. after all this time i still very much like smoking but i think i should make this change about my life. i love drinking my coffee with a cigarette i love smoking one after i eat (it has a "seal the deal" feeling to it) and i especially like smoking a cigarette after having sex. the thing is money is not a problem, in Romania smoking is not that expensive, its 3-4 euro/pack. as a matter of fact if i think of it it was a bit expensive, that's why i turned up to smoking rolled tabaco. got to like that.
well that is my story and i wanted to tell someone that i might try quitting. i don't want to tell it to friends or family because they will be all like "you won't quit, you're a pussy" so from today or maybe tomorrow i will start saying no. Godspeed

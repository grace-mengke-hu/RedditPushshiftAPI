New here. Day 1 complete.

Hey everyone. I'm new to the group here. Hope it's alright for me to share where I'm at.

Had my last cig about 5 pm yesterday. It's now 10:25, so I'm almost a full 30 hours in. This is gonna be tough, but it's time for me to quit and take control of my money and my health. I'm 25, casual smoker since 16, full-on smoker since 19. Recently was smoking about a pack a day before about a month ago when I got the flu. My smoking slowed way down(about half a pack a day), but now it's time to quit!

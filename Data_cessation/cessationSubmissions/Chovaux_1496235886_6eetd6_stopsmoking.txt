May 31st, World No Tobacco Day

Happy No Tobacco Day to you all!! This community is absolutely amazing. If you're struggling to quit, why not make that today? I will do my part and encourage my friends/family about not smoking at all this beautiful day. Life is much better being tobacco free. Stay strong, take a deep breath, and keep your chin up. Thank you all for your stories and support!

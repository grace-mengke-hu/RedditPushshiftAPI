Slip-Up Cigarettes

I’m 37 days free so far. This is my first real quit. I did try once very many years ago but don’t recall much about it. 

I’m wondering what everyone’s experiences are with the ‘oh shit I caved in’ cigarette. That first one after a quit. Does it taste disgusting and make you feel weird? Or is it like having an orgasm? 

I’m not planning on doing it by the way. I’m just curious.

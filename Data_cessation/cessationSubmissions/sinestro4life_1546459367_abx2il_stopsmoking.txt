trying ti quit smoking with anxiety and stressful job

Hello,this is probably a common question, i suffer from anxiety and have a very stressful job. I am trying to quit, but when ever i don't have a cigarette i get very depressed or my anxiety starts coming out. Any advice will be helpful. Thank You

is it better to go cold turkey or cut down?

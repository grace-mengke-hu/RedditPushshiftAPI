Some Reality For Me: 45 Year Puff Master

Yea.  I smoked for 45 years.  30 heavily.  Now, first time quit, simple cold turkey. O'er 100 days in.  I'm styling. But I still think about those "glorious" smokes.  But I just can't and I realize after smoking so long it's gonna take me some time, probably the rest of my life to just say to myself, "just can't do it anymore" ... that's a little sad to me... but man, I love breathing. I love being the master of my life.  

See... I've had a few brewskis.  I'm missing a smoke.  I had a craving, but what I did is use that energy to post here.  And now I'm over that little desire.  =)

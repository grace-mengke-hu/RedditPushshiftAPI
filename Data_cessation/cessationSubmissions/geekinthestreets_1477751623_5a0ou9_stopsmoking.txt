A testing week

So last weekend I suffered a bit but I came out the other side. On Monday I sliced my thumb open while trying to be good and occupy myself by cooking. I like cooking and it's a distraction from the nicotine goblins. The thumb is fine. It's just difficult to do some stuff and occupying my hands while having small cravings didn't really happen. Oh and it was my busiest week of the month at work. Cue me slowing down to about 75% capacity.

I get to today. I've had a great night's sleep and the thumb is healing nicely. I got up to do a bit of shopping and while I was out, some idiot rear ends me. Everything is being sorted by the insurance company and I already have a courtesy car. The stress of dealing with it has been taken away. However the shock of it coupled with my thumb injury this week is testing my resolve to keep going somewhat. I could really go for a ciggie right now. I'd go for a walk but I'm afraid I'd just go and buy some.

Today is Day 3...

Hi folks, I am new here. I finished off day 2 yesterday and on the way to completing day 3. I am quitting cold turkey. I've quit many times before, and one time it was for 2 years! But sadly, I quit being a quitter :-(. For me, the early stages of the quit are usually easier for me. No major side-effects so far other than restless sleep some nights. I am feeling good and confident about this quit. Worrying about the future won't help so I take it day by day. I know my trigger is usually in the summer time around vacation-time and usually involves camping, beer and sitting around a campfire. Anyways, glad to be here. I hope I can contribute in some small way to the community here. Cheers !

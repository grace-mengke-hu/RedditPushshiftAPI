Feeling really low tonight, I've got a lot on my mind. Really craving right now. I know I won't smoke but it's making the rest of it just that much more difficult.

I've tried to write out what's going on in my life, but it just sounds so petty when I read it back to myself.  I don't know why I can't get my mind to slow down.  I just poured myself a beer and am sitting down in front of the T.V.  I just keep telling myself that the most important thing is that I don't smoke.  Everything else will work itself out and there's nothing I can do about it tonight.

How do I get past the first day?

Hey everyone. I've been wanting to quit for a while now. So I have a few questions. Some background info. I'm 24, been smoking since I was 16. Between 16-18 I was on one smoke every few days. After 18 I somehow became a pack a day without even realising it. Now I smoke roughly a 25 gm pouch every 4ish days. 

1) how do you get past the first day? I had to "quit" for about 8 hours last week and I went crazy. Felt like there were a few hundred insects in my brain gnawing away. I can't imagine being able to get through that for 24 hours let alone 2 days, a week, a month or even a year.

2) how did you guys get motivated? I logically want to quit but I find that I make the decision to do so and the next day I forget about it and go back to my normal smoking habit or I keep saying to myself tomorrow will be the day and it never is.

3) when is the best time to quit? I'm currently at uni and I can't imagine sitting exams or doing assignments while my emotions are in whack and not being able to concentrate. Should I wait until the summer holidays or say fuck it and do it tomorrow?

I just came to a realisation

So.. it's day 5 smoke free, which means 50 cigarettes not smoked which also means about £23 not spent on harming my body. I have realised I was spending over £1600 per year for the privilege of basically killing myself. 

I was paying good money to kill myself! Money I could be spending on making myself better, maybe I will buy a bike and get fit, buy some flowers for my girlfriend.

I can feel now the rest of this journey is going to be a lot easier.

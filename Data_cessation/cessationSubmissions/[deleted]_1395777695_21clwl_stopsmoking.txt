I'm on day 10. Cold turkey. Already starting to feel incredible! How many of you were pack-a-day smokers like I was? (story inside!)

I turned 26 a few days ago and decided that I'm closer to 30 than to 20. My Wii Fit U said I was obese (It said "That's Obese!"). I started to do yoga and light exercise but my lungs were just not having it.

I decided how ridiculous it would be to try to lead a healthy lifestyle and be a pack-a-day smoker at the same time. I decided that I'm opening a tax-free savings account (I'm in Canada) with the nearly $5000 ($15.50 a pack here!) I'll be saving every year and I'm going to be buying a nice mountain bike in a few weeks once the trails are fully open. I'm also going to cycle to work year-round like a tonne of people do in this wilderness city. 

Anyway. I'm pumped that I could do this. My room-mate/lovely friend hides her pack and doesn't smoke in the car in support of my dedication. I have a fake cigarette or water vapour/vegetable glycol E-cig in case I try to slip back into the ritual but I haven't even needed this yet.

Tricks on how I succeeded so far:

- Skipped the morning coffee altogether for the first few days..I then had tea instead. Today I had coffee at work and no cravings.
- Told my co-worker not to ask me to go out on breaks with her for the first few days and not mention quitting or ask me how things were going.
- Supportive roomate, but not too congratulatory.

 I find that I used my birthday as a symbolic *I'm older and need to change NOW* kind of passage..You have to WANT to quit to succeed. 

**Edit** I've been coughing quite a bit in the last two days because my throat is super itchy..is this normal? I alleviate this by drinking a tonne of water.

High stress work environment.. Cant go more than 3 days..

How the hell do you deal with the stress and anger with quitting? With what i'n doing for work i can't seem to go more than 3 days without a cigarette..

I dont know if i have it in me to quit so long as i'm working for my current employer.

How do you guys do it?

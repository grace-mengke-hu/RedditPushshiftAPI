My boyfriend has me buy him his smokes

So my boyfriend smokes a pack a day and lost his id he also has no insurance or registration right now for his car...he expected me to loan him my car to drive out of state when it’s in my moms name....I told him that’s up to her and he didn’t say it but the way he was acting toward me made me feel like he was blaming me....so since he has no license bc he lost it I decided to not buy him cigarettes...bc if he wouldn’t have smoked all month he could of bought the things he needed to go out of state...he has now flipped our couch over and the pieces are separated and is basically throwing a fit...I love him but he is gonna he mad at me for a while...I think it’s for the best though...does anyone have tips for dealing with a smoker going through withdraws

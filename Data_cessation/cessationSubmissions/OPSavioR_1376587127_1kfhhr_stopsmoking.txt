Today is the day

Ive smoked since I was 16 and now Im 19 turning 20 In a few months. Im Getting my first paycheck tommorow. I will not spend anything of it on smoking or nicotine substitutes. Ive wasted so much money on smoking Ive missed out on alot and I have no money saved, the paycheck is all I got. Wish me luck.

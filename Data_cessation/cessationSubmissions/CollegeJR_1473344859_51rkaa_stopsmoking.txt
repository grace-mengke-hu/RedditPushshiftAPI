Quitting = increased anxiety?

I haven't smoked in over a year. It was sometime around the beginning of July 2015 I think. Anyways I rarely even think about smoking but when I smoked I feel like my anxiety wasn't as bad and it'd helped me relax. Have any quitters noticed that they're more stressed and anxious?

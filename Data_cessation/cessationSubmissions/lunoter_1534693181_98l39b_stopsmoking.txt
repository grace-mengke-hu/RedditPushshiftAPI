6th day on Champix

Hi everyone,hope all of you are having an easy going while quitting.

Mine’s been relatively easy thanks to the miraculous champix except for the odd intense craving which I can manage but as of late I seem to have this “saudade” for the throat hit or that rush,the smell of tobacco as it came swirling out of my nose,drinking tea and smoking late into night whilst listening to jazz and chatting up with my buddies,that sorta thing.

How can I beat this longing ?

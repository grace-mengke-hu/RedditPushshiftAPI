This is hard

My badge is incorrect. It's only been 18 hours.  I didn't even realize how much nicotine I was using until I decided to stop.  My brain is completely obsessed. I can't even focus enough to write more here.  People talking to me is infuriating.  I just want to be alone for a few days while I ride this out.

p.s.  I should also say that I have about 22 months free from alcohol.  I don't remember it being this harsh.  Not to say that was easy though.

After 6 successful months of chantix, the real challenge is yet to come

Today is my last day of chantix which I've been taking for 6 months now. The stuff really worked for me and I had only minor side effects but zero desire to smoke. During the 6 months I had maybe 2 cigs per month (usually when drinking) which I would usually put out halfway through because I didnt really want it. I should mention that I was a 21 year, pack a day smoker who had tried various methods to quit with little success. Three days was the most I could go without a smoke. I'm pretty stoked about not smoking. My clothes and breath dont stink anymore, which my gf loves btw, and I've had my teeth cleaned as a reward and hopefully as a deterrent to starting up again. But, I feel like I'm very dependant on the chantix and I know my will power isnt very strong when it comes to smoking. I really dont know what to expect over the next few weeks as the medication leaves my system and Im left to fight this on my own. What kinds of things can I do to make sure I stay a non-smoker? 

As a side note: The anti-depressant qualities of the chantix seemed to really help with other problems in my life and Im wondering if asking my doctor for another but similar medication would be helpful to me.

Also, I should thank this community for a lot of good advice and support over the last year. It was a big help and major contributor to my success.

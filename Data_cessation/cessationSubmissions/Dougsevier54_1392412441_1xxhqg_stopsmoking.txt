What do YOU do when the urge strikes?

As my counter shows, I'm 12 days in. I'd like to think I'm past the major urges. Even with Chantix, I still find myself (not very often) saying "I'll try and have a cigarette".

When I say that, or when that thought comes into my head, I simply go into my 6 y/o little girls room and ask her to sing me a song. By the time she is finished, I couldn't want a smoke less! Works every time! 
-If I want one when she's not around, say she's at school, I will actually sing the last song she sang to me! 

Anyhow, I'm curious as to how you all actually get through those urges yourself!

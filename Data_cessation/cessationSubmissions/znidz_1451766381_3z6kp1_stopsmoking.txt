Reset me :( (267 days)

What a shitty start to the year!  
  
I can't believe how the craving can sneak up on you and pop it's ugly head up when you're at your weakest.  
  
I quit 267 days ago. But I had two roll-ups today.  
  
Things have been hard with my GF the last few weeks and we kinda-ish split up this afternoon.  It's probably fixable.
  
Every time we've seen each other lately we've ended up arguing. I've not been the person she's needed me to be and thats led to me pushing her further away when she needed me to get closer. I've been stressed about needing to find work. My contract ends in two weeks.  
  
Anyway ALL of my vape rigs are broken! Couldn't get hold of replacement coils for my eGrip. My K-Box refuses to fire and I had to return my Nebox as it leaked a whole tank.  
  
I AM NOT a smoker again! Getting a replacement vape rig tomorrow. I'm not going to let it get me down.

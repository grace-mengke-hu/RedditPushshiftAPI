Today I'm gonna earn that big fat 1 on my badge.

Today at 23:30 it's going to be 7 days, and I'm going to be out with friends, have a few drinks, and have a good time.

Strange thing: Watching other people smoke doesn't induce cravings, they're triggered by other events.

Anyways, wish you all a good day, don't forget enjoying yourself!

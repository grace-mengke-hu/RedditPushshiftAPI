I'm ready to stop this forever. But I don't know how to manage stress without smoking. What helps you most?

Just threw away my last empty pack, and I'm determined to not buy another. 

For some context: I work at a non-profit where I am essentially the only responsible employee. Because of this, I'm constantly in a state of stress and cigarettes were my only coping mechanism. (I'm using past tense to try to train my brain to think of smoking as something I used to do.) My smoke breaks were also the only way I could get five minutes alone without someone putting something else on my to do list. Also, I just plain old like doing it. I'm relatively confident in my ability to fight off cravings in a vacuum, but I don't really know how to handle stress without nicotine and some quiet alone time. I also know I'm about to be especially irritable and I'd really like to avoid blowing up on a co-worker or employee. If you're like me, how did you start handling anxiety, especially in those crucial first few days?

I'm about to try and quit again

I have about a quarter ounce of tobacco left and I have no money for more unrolled.

I have been steadily going through the last of my bag (started with about 7 ounces of old tobacco) I don't know what to do, I feel like when i get a job again I'll just buy more :( 

I want this to be the last bit of tobacco I consume, what are some things I can do to get my mind off of it, occupy myself... just generally distract me from it?

I have like maybe 2-5 cigs left

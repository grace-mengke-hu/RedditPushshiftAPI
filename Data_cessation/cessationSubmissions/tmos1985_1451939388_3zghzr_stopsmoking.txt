Got a craving? There's a solution. Exercise!

I just went for a 20 minute run for the first time in years non stop. 

I can honestly say my chest has never hurt so bad and I actually nearly got sick. But after all that it really just makes me more determined to run faster and for longer without those dirty cigs.

I would encourage everyone to stay active as much as you can. Even if it's just a walk around the block. One hour later and I feel great.

As of now 24 hours without smoking or craving a cigarette

I've been smoking a pack every 2-3 days for the past 10 years. About a month ago I decided to get on Chantix. I deal with severe PTSD and depression and those were two of the main reasons why I felt compelled to smoke. I was never able to quit before. Chantix really helped me. I had some bizarre nightmares but the compulsion to smoke diminished significantly during the second week when my dosage increased. Last week I went down to 2 cigs a day, the past three days I went down to 1 cig a day. Today was my quit date. I smoked my last cig last night and haven't had another in a little over 24 hours and the best thing is that I do not want to. I had an amazing day and smoking didn't cross my mind even once. My husband and I took our dog to the park, then went to a restaurant sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a drink and dinner. There were people smoking at the table next to us but I didn't want to at all. It's liberating. I'm looking forward to my first cigarette free weekend in 10 years.

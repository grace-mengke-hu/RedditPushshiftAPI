Any advice on a particular problem?

Smoked for about ten years. I recently quit smoking for a month. Then i had one. Then three smokes a few nights later, then i bought a pack and it was back to the races. Since then I've been desperate to get where I was months ago when I quit. I listened to Allen Carr before that successful month, and I gave him a lot of credit because it was easier than I thought. That month was the longest I'd gone without.

Now I keep trying and failing over and over. I start to quit about twice a week, and it hardly lasts a day. I don't like how this has become a pattern. If anyone has had a similar experience, I would appreciate any advice. 

And, this being a support group, if anyone has any generic "Hang in there, Baby!" type things to say then by all means go ahead.

3 months in and I'm still getting cravings

Is this normal? It's been 3 months since I last smoked but I still get major cravings. For example, yesterday I was sitting on my bed for over half an hour debating to myself whether or not to cave in and buy a some cigarettes from the local shop. I also find that I dream of smoking 2-3 times a week. Has anyone else had experience with this?

I started smoking when I was 19, so I smoked for nearly 3 years, which isn't anywhere near as long as other people who don't get cravings anymore. It's like a constant battle to stop myself from starting up smoking again.

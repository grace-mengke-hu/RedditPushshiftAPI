When you stopped, did you know this was it, or were you fearful you would fail?

Read Allen Carrs book almost completely and hit a wall when he says that you need to be completely sure you are going to stop, else read onlyway or attend a seminar... I am not! How can one be?? Do I proceed and possibly fail or wait until I'm sure??

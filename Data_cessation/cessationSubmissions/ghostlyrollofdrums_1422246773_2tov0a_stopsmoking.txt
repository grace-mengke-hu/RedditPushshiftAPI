3 days without NRT and really struggling

Hi. I'm 24, been lurking around here for a while. I started smoking when I was 16. After failing to quit cold turkey I started to use a vaporizer. I started with the 1.6mg juice, and today is my third day of 0% nicotine juice. It's nice to not really get anything from the vaporizer, it's more of a mental crutch now that I hope to dispose of soon. This is my first time trying to quit smoking. 

On my first day without any nicotine whatsoever, my boyfriend and I had a massive fight, which led to me crying in the middle of a nice restaurant.

The next day we were still angry at each other and barely talked. I went out to lunch that afternoon with my mom, who told me that she wants to separate from my dad and move back to her home country. I cried at this news. She is tired of watching my dad (who is very sweet and kind despite being an addict) kill himself with cigarettes, alcohol, and pot. 

Anyway, I'm sorry to vent all of this to you guys, but I just wanted to share that you can be beyond stressed and not cave in to cravings! I've wanted nothing more than to go buy a pack of cigarettes, but I keep telling myself that it's just my addicted brain telling me I want them when I really don't. I'm also motivating myself to stay away from cigarettes because, if I start smoking again, I will never be able to save enough money to get my own apartment. I'm not sure if it's a combination of nicotine withdraw and these major changes in my personal life, but I haven't felt pain like this since I was a severely depressed teenager.

I'm struggling to not want to smoke but I am going to keep fighting because I know they do absolutely nothing for me.

TL;DR: Really stressful first three days without nicotine, but I am surviving and haven't relapsed.

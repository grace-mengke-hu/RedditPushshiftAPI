Booyah! One week.

One week free. Almost exactly 19 years after starting, I've quit a few times before but this is a totally different feeling. So much easier, especially after the first couple days of withdrawal. 

Props to this joint for passive support (as I lurked), and pointing me towards the Allen Carr book ($10 on Amazon). Gives a good alternate and positive perspective that helps a lot.

I also use the free version of the app "Quitnow" that's a good little reminder of the positive things I'm doing by not smoking.

The 24-hour gym is my friend. My wife still smokes (she's reading the book now), and was tough at first, but now I just curl my lip in disgust and flip off the pack she has on the porch as I go in or out of the house. My neighbor thinks I'm flipping her off, but I don't like her anyway so two birds with one stone.

I sometimes get a craving, or try to negotiate with myself. (Remember, that cancer stick is a terrorist and we don't negotiate with terrorists, MURICA!) Particularly since the wife is still smoking, but on the path to quit, I thought today "Well, I'll go ahead and smoke and quit *with* her". Then I mentally kicked myself in the ass and considered the following which has become a bit of a mantra:

1: Dummy, do you realize how nasty it's going to taste, and make you hack?

2: Dummy, do you realize how awesome and clear your sinuses and chest feel right now, and how awesome everything smells and tastes...like when you were a kid? Don't wreck that shit.

3: Speaking of "like a kid", it's pretty nice having the stamina and "bloodflow" of a teenager with the knowledge of an adult, if you know what I mean (giggity).

4: Dummy, you know how you look at these trailer trash girls who hang onto their abusive meth-head boyfriends, and the keep making excuses for them and going back into the trailer for their beating "because he loves me"? That's a smoker, and the smokes are the shit-bag babby-daddy. Fuck that noise.

After four years being smoke-free, I'm outta here.

It was a bumpy road. I quit cold turkey, slipped up, and then I switched to vaping. Vaping helped me wean off nicotine for *real* — and then I finally quit vaping six months ago.

You can do it. I smoked for 10 years. Make a list of what motivates you to quit. Keep it with you. If you're not ready to go to a bar that allows smoking, go to one that doesn't. Don't tempt yourself unnecessarily. Go for broke.

I love you all, and I support all of you. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.

❤️

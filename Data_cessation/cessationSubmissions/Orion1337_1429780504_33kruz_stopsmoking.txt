5 Days smoke free today

I felt like posting because what I'm experiencing with quitting isn't quite what I had expected. It's been a lot easier than I thought, I have only had a handful of cravings so far and the only thing I seemed to notice was how foggy my senses seem and some slight irritability on day 2 and 3 but nothing I couldn't sort out myself.
I've been exercising regularly and drinking very large amounts of B12 and water. I get a bit of a head ache if I'm not drinking water like a fish, but that's okay...I feel great!

I guess day 5 isn't a huge jump and I probably have a lot of work to go but I feel like I have it in the bag. It's all mental at this point and willpower is all it takes.

I smoked a pack a day for around 3 years and decided to quit cold turkey because it's a pointless habit and waste of money.

Two Weeks!

Just want to say thanks everyone! I mostly lurk, but this subreddit has been a huge help. I have been getting my life together one thing at a time and I finally got this monkey off my back.

I rarely get cravings anymore and I can easily use logic to put them at bay. Thanks again everyone, keep on keepin' on.

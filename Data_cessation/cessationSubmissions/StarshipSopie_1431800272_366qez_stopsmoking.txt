I reset my badge today

I had a really stressful conversation with an old friend last night and I must've smoked 5-10 cigarettes in the span of a few hours. I feel disgusting. This morning I woke up nauseated, smelling and tasting like cigarettes. My throat hurts and it's hard to breathe. I'm done. 

Not smoking today won't be a problem, it's going to be in a few days when I've forgotten this feeling.

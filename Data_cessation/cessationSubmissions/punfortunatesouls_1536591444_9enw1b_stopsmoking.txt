Day 3 without Nic

I'm on day three of no nicotine. I've been smoking and vaping almost daily since February. Today might be rough- days 1 and 2 I spent at home but I'm at work all day today. Work has been one of my biggest smoking/vaping triggers. Having a JUUL made discreetly vaping at work way too easy. All I had to do was dip into a corner where the cameras couldn't see me. No smell, didn't even have to go outside.

I didn't bring anything to work with me. No cigs in my bag or car, the JUUL is at home, and I can't leave to go buy anything. So I won't be tempted, but I feel pretty irritable. Trying to breathe through it.

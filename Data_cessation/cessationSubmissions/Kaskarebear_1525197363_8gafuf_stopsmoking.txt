To: My old “friend”

You have been in my life for 15 years, half of my life. You were there when I was stressed, bored and even during some social anxiety. We’ve shared many cups of coffee, long car rides and some pretty epic parties. However, it’s all been a lie. You were never there for me. You’re selfish, controlling, expensive and are toxic to myself and my loved ones. I found some new friends, a community that have already ditched you, they are better without you, and I will be too! 

Signed,
I’m done with you.

Day 20

I almost smoked today. I had that thought, that we all know very well, "One won't hurt". I can't tell you how many times I have quit, gotten through the worst part and then followed through with this thought. Today I decided to change this thought to "one will kill me". Now that the positives are starting to become a new normal and the pain of quitting is fading I have to be extra vigilant against the "one more" that have always lead me back to "I'll quit tomorrow". 

I am chewing the gum which I know is cheating in the Carr world (and I get it). I am still hooked on nicotine and I will have to surrender it soon but let me say that not smoking for 19 days is huge and I can finally envision not ever smoking again. I LOVE not smoking more than I crave cigarettes and today was proof. 

Tomorrow is Day 20. I have not not smoked for 20 days in a very, very long time.

Not sure if quitting now would ruin everything else.

I just quit the booze for a second time. Used to be an alcoholic, relapsed Saturday after my father figure's funeral but back to sobriety. The only thing left to kick is the nicotine addiction.

I know I'm the only one who knows how my brain is, but I've already been struggling with a short fuse and just trying not to drown in sadness without the use of alcohol. I can barely focus at work, just due to processing grief. I've been chain vaping like a fiend and feel like shit. 

I can't tell if quitting nicotine now would be too overwhelming and cause me to go back to the booze, and to stop processing my grief in heathy ways. On the other hand, this is such a life shaking event that it almost makes sense to pile on a couple of hard things and just get through all of it at once. What do you think?

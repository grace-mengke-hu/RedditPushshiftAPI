Quitting around friends who smoke + alcohol gives you a black belt in self-control.

Whenever I come back to this sub, I just admire my badge for a minute and remember all the times I really wanted a cigarette, but resisted even with alcohol involved. My friends all smoke and smelling it around them was soooo tempting for at least the first two months. But after it started to smell bad again I knew I was basically in the clear.

This extends to other parts of your life as well. Successfully quitting is an enormous accomplishment, and is a testament to your willpower, patience and self-control. Honing these skills applies to just about everything challenging in life, and looking back on every time you stayed strong is a great way to remind yourself of that.

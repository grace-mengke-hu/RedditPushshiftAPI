Needing to refocus

I came back to browse this sub today because I've been thinking more about smoking this weekend than I have in a while  I remember when I first quit all I thought about was cigarettes, I remember wondering if I'd ever stop thinking about them first thing in the morning when I woke up.  I did though.  I made it to week five and got more comfortable, it didn't pervade my thoughts as it once had.

I checked in here less and less, didn't feel the same need as I had before..until this weekend.  It's been fairly constant.  I even made a coffee and thought I'll get the ashtray now and have a.....damn, I don't smoke anymore.  Shit, why did I think that?

Then today I see a few people on here who are quit about the same length as me, and some have slipped.  Now I'm afraid.  I don't want to slip, but I do want this horrible feeling of want to disappear.  I can reason it out in my head, I know what  is best, I won't smoke...but I hate the feeling of want.

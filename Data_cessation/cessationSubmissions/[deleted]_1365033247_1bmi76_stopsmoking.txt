Reddit and Allen Carr

Early Sunday morning, I am sitting outside having my morning smoke.  As part of the ritual, I am browsing the new links in reddit that have collected while I slept.  I've only been out of bed or maybe 10 minutes, when I see a link discussing the relation between how soon a smoker has their first cigarette in the morning and the likelihood that they will get lung or oral cancer.

I snicker to myself considering the coincidence and start scanning the comments of the thread.  

Someone links to /r/stopsmoking and I check it out.  I see many people suggesting Allen Carr so I buy the audiobook an head to work.  

At 5:30pm on Sunday afternoon, I smoked my last cigarette.  It has been 3 days so far.

I recognize my cravings for what they are and am surprised how easy it has been.  I've tried chantix, e-cigs, willpower, and have failed miserably.  But for some reason Carr made the light come on.  

Three days down...the rest to go.

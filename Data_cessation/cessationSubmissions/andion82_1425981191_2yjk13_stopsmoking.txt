Everything tastes SO salty after quitting

I did not notice a great enhancement of my taste, but everything tastes 2x more salty for me. Yesterday I was having microwave popcorn and it was... disgusting.

I was the kind of person that always put more salt onto already seasoned food: soups and salads specially. I always loved salty food. Sunflower seeds, dried and salted cod (typical here in North Spain),  fish cooked in salt... 

Do any of you experienced the same? I'm really curious about more side-effects, what was the most surprising for you?

I'm looking forward to experience more side-effects myself as months pass, because I'm never smoking again. Period. Thanks for the encouragement /r/stopsmoking ! :)

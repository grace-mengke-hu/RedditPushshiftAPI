Quit 5 years ago... Smoking again. Don't know what to do

I quit in April 2010 after smoking for over 10 years. I quit because I had leg surgery and couldn't make it out of the house for a week. I'm in my last year of university now with 20 days left until my last final exam. I recently started smoking a few with a friend at school for some reason. I just bought a pack, i'm hiding it from my girlfriend, and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice? I'm not the type to reach out but I don't know what to do. :(

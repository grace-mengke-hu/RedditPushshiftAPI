Smoking weed after quitting tobacco

So i quit 2 weeks ago after smoking one pack for over 10 years and it has been going really good so far.

However im a regular pot smoker, smoked pot before starting cigarettes and i decided to take a break till the end of summer with weed too so that i dont risk smoking cigs again since i had this unhealthy habit of smoking tons of cigs after a joint.

So while im very very confident that im done smoking cigarettes,  i plan on smoking pot again once the next semester starts and im back to the student lifestyle. 

Does anyone have any experience to share how it was for them to smoke weed again after quitting, did yall feel the urge to smoke tobacco again and any advice on how to smoke it? I always rolled joints with tobacco and was thinking using the bong since spliffs might hook me back on tobacco. 

And before anybody advices me on quitting weed too...i know, i know but that i cant quit right now. Not until i at least graduate since weed is just too big of a part of my life now as a student (damn, i sound like a junkie).

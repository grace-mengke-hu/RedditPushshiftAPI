3 year smoker, min 1/2 pack a day

I have been fighting with my addiction to nicotine since I began smoking. It started out as an occasional thing when I was drinking and over the course of a couple months turned into an aggressive habit. I have been smoking a minimum of half a pack a day for three years, though often It’s more, up to a whole pack. I want to quit deep within myself but every time I try, something causes me to go back. I work in an extremely stressful environment around a lot of smokers, and my parents smoked my entire life growing up. But I want to quit because of the goals I have set for myself for my future, I simply know I can’t achieve my goals without quitting. I need advice, strategies, literally anything to help put me on the path to kicking this bullshit habit. Any help Is appreciated

Finally cleaned my smoke pit

Yes, it took me a month, but I haven't wanted to hang out in my smoking spot due to triggers.  Today I was feeling strong and went out there to clean the 'ol ashtray and throw out any assorted butts and empty packs floating around. 

I thought I'd feel cravings for one, but instead I just felt disgusted at all the toxic black sludge and reeking odor of countless nasty cigarettes.   That shit used to go in my lungs.  I'd have done anything to keep sucking them back in my nasty little smoke pit.... and for the life of me I cannot remember the appeal.

Win.

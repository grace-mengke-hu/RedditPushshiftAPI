Forgot it was 9 months!

Hi! 

Smoke free reminded me a few days ago I’ve been smoke free longer than if I’d been to term with a baby! Yay. 

Anyway, I used to live on this site, it kept me going so I want to say to those of you starting, struggling, persevering...

It is the best thing you will ever do in quitting! 

Any withdrawal symtoms go completely.
You do not always want a smoke. That’s a lie! 
Life is easier without them.
If you gain weight, you will lose it. 
If you’re angry at the world and would gnaw your arm off for a smoke, don’t! Being a smoker becomes a past version of you! 

I’ve just done a sprint triathlon, go to the gym everyday, stopped drinking, got in shape, stopped being smelly, stopped having a chesty cough that sounds like it’s from the depth of hell... etc etc.

It’s so good to be free! 

Good luck wherever you are, and keep going no matter what :)

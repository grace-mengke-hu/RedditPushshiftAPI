Cravings are tough

The cravings never stop..
You just get better at saying "no"

500 something days clean
But this has been a difficult day with multiple triggers and cravings. 

I'm recently in between jobs and feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety. Who else but an old friend to try and comfort me? 

I still really do feel your frustration and difficulty quitting after all this time. It's hell the first week, it's hell the second week, and every now and then it's hell for a day. 

Looking for an easy way out.. Gum, e-cigs, even saw myself buying a pack to ease the tightness and irritability but DONT do it!!!!

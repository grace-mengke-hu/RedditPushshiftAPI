A month's results of quitting

I attended a funeral of a family member last month. He passed away at 39 and had many health issues such as heart complications, etc. All I could think of was "that could be me in 5 years".

The next day I said I quit! By 11am I had caved and purchased a pack of smokes. That's when I realized that I just can't do it on my own. At lunch break I called my Dr's office and got an appointment for that day. I wanted to try Chantix despite all the weird things I heard about it (messed up dreams, depression, etc).

I began taking Chantix the next day. It's been one month and one week since I started taking it. I smoked regularly (about a pack a day) for the first week. The second week I smoked lightly (3-5 cigs a day) for 3 days, then just stopped. No agitation, no anxiety, I just stopped. However, I did smoke when I went out to the bar. Instead of my usual ~16 cigs at the bar I smoked about 5. It wasn't from focusing on not having any, it just simply happened that way, I had no desire for more.

Since then I haven't had a single sober cigarette. I've also successfully gone out to the bar 3 times without having a cigarette. I did fail one night at the casino and had about 8 over a 13 hour period while drinking, but I'm trying not to beat myself up over it. I'm really happy that so far my failures have been limited to when I am drinking, and I haven't failed every time.

I plan to continue using Chantix for a total of 3 months. I can smell things I haven't been able to smell before. I can smell cigarette smoke on people's clothes. I don't wake up completely congested and my slight but persistent cough has disappeared. 

I've been smoking for 13 years. I turned 34 years old two days ago. I want to live. I've never had this kind of success before when trying to quit. I know this will be it.

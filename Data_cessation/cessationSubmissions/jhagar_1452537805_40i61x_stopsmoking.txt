Fighting complacency, preparing for the ambush.

I've made it 10 days now, thanks in no small part to help from this forum. Cravings are dropping off to once or twice a day and I spend most of the time not even thinking about it. As encouraging as it is to be here, I know from past experience quitting that the biggest threats from here on out are complacency and arrogance.

For those of you who've made it long-term, how do you stay vigilant long term and still enjoy it? How do you prepare for that ambush that comes weeks/months after you quit when you've had a couple drinks and you're suddenly ready to say "why not"?

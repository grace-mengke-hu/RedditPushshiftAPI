Day 12 Avoiding everyone

The cravings come and go but are always due to some sort of trigger.  For me it’s living among smokers.  My co-workers, friends, family all smoke so for the last two weeks I’ve mostly avoided everyone.  Work is the hardest because I used to really enjoy that quick break outside chatting with co-workers.  Now I’ll take quick walk breaks outside and that helps.  I look forward to a time when I can be around smokers and not be triggered.

I made it after 4 weeks!

Hey everyone,

First time posting in this sub--been a lurker all throughout.

I would like to thank each and every one of you for continually supporting everyone in the sub. Without you guys posts, this journey would probably have been more difficult.

For those who are still lurking, thinking about quitting, I highly recommend the "Smoke Free App"! It is a great way to put things in perspective, or somewhat of a tangible artifact to see your results.

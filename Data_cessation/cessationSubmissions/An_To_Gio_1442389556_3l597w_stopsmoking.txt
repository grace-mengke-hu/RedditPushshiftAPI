Almost two months smoke-free

QuitNow! Pro tells me I've been smoke-free for 59 days.
To all the quitters-to-be: it doesn't get easy. It gets hard in different ways.
For instance, yesterday my parents left around two boxes of cigarettes and keep on smoking in my face: I'd rather have been able to run 1500 km by the end of the year than not to be able to climb a flight of stairs without panting.
You won't be struggling with physical craving after a few days.
As for me, I've been struggling with boredom: cigs helped me structure my days for so long that I found it hard to adapt.
I gained 4 kilos (8,8 pounds) but I shed them and I'm currently back at my ideal weight (1,8 m and 72 kilos = 5'9" and 159 pounds).
Before quitting write down your triggers and your stressors, don't think sheer willpower will get you through a nasty addiction like this.
It's funny, but I hav also decreased my coffee consumption (and I'm the guy who was given a "Coffeine junkie" mug back in the day).

failed last night after 9 days. starting again.

this sucks. i wish i hadn't gotten drunk.

lesson learned: i really cannot handle my alcohol and if i want to quit smoking, i apparently have to quit drinking too.

if i make it through the next few days again, i'll be surprised. i already want to just give up and quit quitting, but i am going to go to the gym instead.

Time for a smoke! No, I don't smoke.

One day down. I've been down this road many times before.

As I'm relaxing after work, I fall back into this weird place where I'll think, "I should go smoke a cigarette." Then I remind myself, "No, you don't smoke anymore." Then about 45 seconds later, it'll just pop right back into my head again. I'm caught in a loop here, and I can't find anything to occupy my mind to distract me. so Even as I type this, two parts of my brain are going in circles with each other:

Time for a smoke! 
No. I don't smoke. 


...


Time for a smoke!
No. I don't smoke.


...


Time for a smoke!

So it's not the worst thing ever, but it's super annoying and I look forward to these thoughts and impulses becoming less frequent. I know I can live without cigarettes. I just don't like feeling like I have to prove it to myself constantly. I can't wait for it to feel normal.

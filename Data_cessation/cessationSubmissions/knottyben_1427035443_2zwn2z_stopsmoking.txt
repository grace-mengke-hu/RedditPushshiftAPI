This time, with gusto!

I've quit before. Two months here, three weeks there, you know the drill. It's difficult, as we know. 
BUT TODAY IS THE DAY. 
I've heard it said before "Quitting smoking is hard because nobody cares if you smoke or not."
The saying is something like that. 
Well, tell that to someone with a pregnant wife. 
My baby mama can't stand the smell of me. It's really quite sad not being able to cuddle with my warm preg when i get home from work without going through a sort of cleaning routine to get the smell off of me. 

But those days are over. In 7 weeks, I'm going to be a dad. 

People have told me "You have to quit for you, not for anyone else "
I say fuck that, because if it wasn't for my wife and unborn son, i wouldn't even think about quitting. 

I just turned the faucet on my half full pack of American Spirits after giving myself the 8 hour head start of sleeping.

Shortness of breath after quitting?

Hello /r/stopsmoking

I quit 11 days ago. Haven't had a single one since then which I'm really proud of! I was feeling pretty good the first 9 days... however the past couple of days I've noticed that my breathing is much shallower than normal. It seems to be only when I'm at rest. Is this a normal side effect that others have experienced and if so, can I expect it to go away?
Thanks for any help!

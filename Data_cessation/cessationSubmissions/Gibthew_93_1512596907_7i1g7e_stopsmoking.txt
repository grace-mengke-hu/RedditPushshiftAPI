Conquering Temptation! (in progress)

So today my wife's uncle passed away and she is pretty upset.  We decided on Monday of this week that we weren't buying anymore cigarettes.  However, she broke down and bought some today.  I've resisted once today but I know it's going to be much harder to resist when I have the constant opportunity to have one when I get home.  Is there any insight this great online community can share with me to help hold true to a smokeless life?

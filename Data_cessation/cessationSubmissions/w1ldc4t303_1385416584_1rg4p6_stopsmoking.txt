My biggest obstacle: my mood

I have been working on quitting for few months by slowly reducing the number of cigs i have everyday, and slowly destroying the associations i have with smoking.

ie I no longer have a smoke right when i wake up or right before bed or right after a meal.

But i make it almost one day into quitting before i start feeling crabby, like REALLY pissy.  I'll even know in my own head that its not a big deal and that its only because my body is crazing nicotine, but it doesnt help. the smallest, stupidest shit just makes my blood boil.

Anybody else experience this? or know a good way to deal with it.

I work in an office so i really cant be getting pissy at ppl for no reason.

HELP!!

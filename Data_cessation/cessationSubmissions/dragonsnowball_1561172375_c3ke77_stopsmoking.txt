A Quitting Smoking Meditation

I'm breathing in fresh, clean air
I'm breathing out all the toxins from cigarettes

I'm breathing in better circulation 
I'm breathing out the nicotine that constricts my blood vessels 

I'm breathing in better lung capacity 
I'm breathing out the tobacco that harms my body 

I'm breathing in air that will keep my lungs alive
I'm breathing out the filth of cigarettes

I'm breathing in patience
I'm breathing out the hold cigarettes have over me 

I'm breathing in new ways of seeing things
I'm breathing out bad habits as they're becoming old

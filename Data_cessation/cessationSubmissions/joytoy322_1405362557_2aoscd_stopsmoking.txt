When does the physical withdrawal stop?

So I'm approaching the 48 hour mark. Even though, I've been considering today day 3 because I quit at 5:30pm on the 12. I know it doesn't make sense but I guess I considered the rest of that day day one because I generally stay up to around 4am. 

Either way, am I almost out of the woods here? I haven't had one craving so far but I feel like crap. It's anxiety and bit of dizziness. 

I'd like to say though that there's NO WAY IN HELL this could scare me into smoking. On the day I quit I knew I was done for good. I just want to know if I'm almost out of the physical crap because it certainly sucks >.>

Day2

Today is my second day without a smoke.  My youngest son wants to comfort me, my oldest son said “again “ my daughter is staying away and my husband has stopped too! I cant concentrate or complete one task or thought. I want to cry! But instead I’m yelling.! I could really use some encouragement!?! Thanks

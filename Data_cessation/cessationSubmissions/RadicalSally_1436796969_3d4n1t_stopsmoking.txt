I survived vacation

I went on a two week trip to Europe and managed not to have one cigarette. It seemed like they were everywhere. There was even a cigarette dispensing machine next to the bakery in the little Bavarian town I stayed in for the majority of my trip. I came close to buying a pack several times as I walked by it, but resisted. It seemed like everywhere we sat down to eat (outside usually because the weather was beautiful) someone near by was smoking. Perhaps at home I don't notice it as much because I'm usually at work, or because cigarettes are banned in most restaurants - even if you're sitting on the deck. 

But I made it. So glad the friends I stayed with were all non-smokers. If they weren't I don't think I would have been able to resist.

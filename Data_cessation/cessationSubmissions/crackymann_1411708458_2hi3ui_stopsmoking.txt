Tomorrow i'm going to fail.

I know it's going to happen.  

The vacation i've been planning for months. I leave tomorrow. It will happen. I'll be on the beach. Someone will crack open a hard pack and tilt it towards me. I'll inhale sharply through my nose hoping to catch a whiff of the tobacco leaves. I'll break down and say yes. It will be glorious and I will deserve it and ... 

It won't be worth it. So inebriated, I may enjoy it for a second. But very shortly I'll recoil, my eyes opening wide from the rush of nicotine. It will feel heavy, and uncomfortable. I'll wish I hadn't been so selfish.

Observations from the cusp of four weeks

Hello friends. I haven't been all that active in the sub, and for that I apologize. I offer words of encouragement when I can, but for the most part, this sub has helped me just to see the struggles other former smokers are going through.

I'm here to tell you all that it gets better. I had the worst day I've had since quitting yesterday (ex-fiancee drama, professional failure, THE WORKS), and at one point, my best friend said, "Man, I think you really just need to smoke a cig and chill out."

Believe me, he meant well (I was in a very bad place, I don't blame him at all), but I turned that shit down so emphatically I almost surprised myself. One drag=one cig=you're a smoker again.

TL;DR Cigarettes are like that nasty ex you still hook up with. Stop it.

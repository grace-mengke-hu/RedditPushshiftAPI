Tips on making exercise easier?

Hey friends,

So despite what my badge says, I'm actually into my sixth day of no smoking and so far I've been really impressed with myself; I'm handling my cravings, keeping my mood in check and my spirits high with relative aplomb. But tonight I went for a run after God knows how long and you can pretty much track my whole run with my trail of loogies. Every fifty steps or so I'm basically hacking up a lung and choking on phlegm, it's terrible! So my question to all of you is how have y'all handled this? Are there methods to purging all of this excess, stored up phlegm, or am I destined to suffer through this until my smoking related congestion has minimized? Looking forward to any tips or tricks y'all might have. Thank you, and keep up the hustle!

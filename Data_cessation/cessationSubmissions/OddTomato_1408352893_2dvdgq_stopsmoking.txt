One Cig A Day

I've been smoking since I was 21, but I've never been a heavy smoker. I often smoke when I drink (perhaps 3/4 sticks, over a span of 5-6 hours), and on a daily basis, I only have that one stick a day. At most, two. It still gets me all phlegmy, I still dislike it but I think the fact that I keep telling myself "It's just one stick, homie", is kinda making it tough to completely let go. I do not buy a packet of cigs, even. Just opting to a.) bumming one off a mate or b.) buying just one stick (it's possible here). 

I want to quit completely, but I need that push, because I keep telling myself one stick ain't all that bad.

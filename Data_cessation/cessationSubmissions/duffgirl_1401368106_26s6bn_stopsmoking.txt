After ten years, I'm three days in without a cigarette

I am considering getting an e-cigarette.  Mostly so I have something to do with my hands, and so I can get some nicotine (with the aim to gradually decrease the amount) but without the smell, the chemicals, etc.  Are e-cigs a good idea or...?  Don't know where to start.  Since I'll still be getting the nicotine does it even count as having quit?

I have the Quit Now app and it's nice seeing how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, and how much money I've saved, but the health benefits must surely be skewed if I continue to intake nicotine... will I still get health benefits from having switched from analogue to digital, so to speak?

Starting smoking Easter 2004 when I was 15.  Never thought I'd go  this long without lighting up.

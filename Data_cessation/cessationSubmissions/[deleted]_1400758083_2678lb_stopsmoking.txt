Starting tonight...

Ran out of cigarettes around midnight and I decided I wouldn't buy any more a few days ago. Tonight seems great for it! My relationship with my gf seems like it's going to end... and I'm drinking heavily (yay for mid-week "weekends").

Smoking is such a habitual thing for me lately. I think I've been smoking for around 7-8 years. I don't even remember at what point I started, or why. And now it seems impossible to quit.

I've been following this sub for like a month now... and constantly telling myself I'm gonna quit... but it practically feels like I'm giving up a part of me. I don't know how to explain it better than that, but I'm sure some out there will understand.

And with that, my semi drunken ramblings end. Hopefully I can stay cigarette free from now on...

Edited for spacing... forgot you had to double return.

Mental well being significant improvement

Ever since quitting, I have felt a increase in my overall health. My stress has gone down drastically in life and my amount of anxiety and panic attacks has decreased significantly. Quitting smoking has led me to be able to work out more and i have decreased my overall mile time by four minutes. I am now close to my pre smoking shape and only getting better. I am happier in life and no longer face criticism and judgement from my friends who always told me to quit. I want to thank this sub for the motivation it gave me to stick to not smoking despite all my temptations to go to the store and buy a pack.Thanks and good luck to you all, its the best decision I have made.

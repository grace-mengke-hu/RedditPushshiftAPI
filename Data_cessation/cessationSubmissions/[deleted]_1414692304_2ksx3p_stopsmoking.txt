Somebody Talk Me Down, Maybe?

So... 8 days in. Almost no cravings anymore. I'm really doing well. But...

I'm a little scared. My throat feels like there is a lump in it. Off to the side of my windpipe. It's been getting worse over the past, maybe, three weeks. It's kind of freaking me out.  I have just recently switched jobs and do not have health insurance until next month. Could this be throat cancer? Am I being paranoid or something?

whew..

Anyways, any ideas? Just wait til I have insurance and try not to think about it?

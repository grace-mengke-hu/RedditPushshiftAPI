I think I'm giving up for now.

I'm almost 8 days deep and I'm at a really bad spot in my life. I don't want to go into details but I can't handle the stress without smoking. I want to quit eventually and I know I'm capable of it now, but right now I can't. I'm a fucking pussy and I'm letting everyone down, sorry folks.

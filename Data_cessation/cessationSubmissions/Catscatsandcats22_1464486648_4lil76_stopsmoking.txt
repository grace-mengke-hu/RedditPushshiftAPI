Struggling - 9 days

Hi everyone,

Recovering heroin addict and graduate student here. I have a few months off the H and 2 months off all drugs and alcohol, but for some reason kicking the cigs for good is really killing me.

I'm just writing here to introduce myself to the community and try to find some support here. A lot of people smoke cigs in recovery/NA/AA programs, and I just don't want to do this anymore. I've been told it's not as big of a deal and to perhaps focus on other problems than stopping cigarettes, but i've been trying to get off these things for a fucking year and i swear to god it gets worse every time.

I'm dealing with an extremely difficult assignment that is due soon, as long as great nervousness in seeing a family member that i was estranged from for many years on tuesday. please help me stay off these things!!

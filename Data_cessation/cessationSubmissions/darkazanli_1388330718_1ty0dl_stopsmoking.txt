I've been smoking since i was 12 years old, now i need to quit - i need help

hey guys, so i've been smoking for the better part of my life.

to be completely honest i have a love-hate relationship with smoking, as i'm sure many of you do. i love to smoke but i hate what it's doing to me.

i have tried quitting countless times but since i have been smoking for so long, its more then just an addiction, it's part of me. it fits in just perfectly between my fingers and it feels just right in my mouth (thats what she said).

so i need some advice on how i can quit, chances are i have tried it before but tell me anyways

p.s. i've heard of this Alan Carr guy and his book, has anyone here had any success with it?

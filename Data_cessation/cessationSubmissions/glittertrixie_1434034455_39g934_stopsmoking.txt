Fell off the wagon, got right back on

New poster in this forum but I need some support, gang!  My latest quit is going well (8 days!) but I've fallen off the wagon a couple times this week.  Had one Tuesday, one today.  I'm down to this from half-a-pack a day for 8 years.  I'm doing well, right?  RIGHT? *breathes*

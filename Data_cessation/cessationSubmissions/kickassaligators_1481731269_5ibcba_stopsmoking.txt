Setting your self up for success

I'm 40 hours into my latest attempt at quiting and feeling very positive this time around because I feel I've self up to succeed rather than to fail like times in the past e.g. Trying to quit a week before  ads holiday etc.

Ways I've set my self up to succeed:

1. Quit caffeine cold turkey. Not only has this really reduced my general anxiety but It was good test run for dealing with cravings.

2. Meditating. I've built up a fairly consistent habit of meditating at least 15 minutes daily which I've found makes it easier to recognize.

3.  Be healthy. I ordered a load supplements to take every day specifically aimed at helping with nicotine withdrawal as well as daily exercise and healthy eating.

4. Picking the right time. I intentionally put it off until after a potentially stressful weekend away with my GF's family even though I was feeling enthusiastic prior to going away. 


What methods do you guys have making it easier for yourself whilst going through withdrawal?

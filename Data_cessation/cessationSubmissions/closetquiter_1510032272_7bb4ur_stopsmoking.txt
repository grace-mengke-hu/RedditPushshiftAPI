Vaping?

I quit 42 days ago by getting a vape. I am doing 6mg nicotine, and plan on going down to 3mg next refill. I think it has helped with the habit of having one on the way to work, after coffee, after lunch, etc.  I’m not going back, but I’m afraid my addictive personality will like the vaping and just continue smoking a vape...  thoughts on my approach to quitting the cancer sticks?

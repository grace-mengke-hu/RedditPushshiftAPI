Super-ultra craving stopped

Okay, so sorry for spaming, but this is madness. Last night almost drunk smoke, today nearly smoked with my brother, then everyone leaves, I finish my garden work and I see my mothers cigg on the table. Things happen in fastforward, and I was outside with a cig in my mouth (unlit). I've been like that for 15mins, and did not smoke. Was thinking that this would be a perfect environment to smoke(time, weather, etc) but it really is as they say. These things are even better without the ciggs. Just wanted to write it out of myself.

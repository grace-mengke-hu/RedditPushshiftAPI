emotionally speaking, the second week is the worst to me

I'm legit on a rollercoaster lol. If I remember well last time (little more than one year ago) that I quit (also the first time) I also had similar emotional turmoils.

So, today I feel melancholic because my room mate, who is also colleague of mine and with whom I've shared so much in the last year, moved today after 9 months of living together. Now, this wouldn't be that dramatic normally but right now I feel like a little girl moving towns.

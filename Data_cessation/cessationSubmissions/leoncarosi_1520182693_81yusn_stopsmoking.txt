Stay Strong, Quitters!

Some lazy Sunday in the far-flung future, I hope you also happen upon this subreddit again by chance, see that your badge is over 2000, and realize how far you've come from these first few difficult days. 

If you can make it to three days, you can make it to a month. And if you can make it to a month, you can make it to five years, no sweat.

Keep at it! Believe in yourself! You're better than some dumb addiction!

For real, though, those first three days are torture. I especially hope you guys in the throes of that realize it gets so much better.

Stay strong!

Quit smoking 2-3 weeks ago, still snusing. Withdrawals anyway?

So as the topic says I quit smoking a few weeks ago.
A few days ago I noticed some dizziness, which is still there from time to time. Also a little anxious (maybe due to the dizziness) and a general craving for a cigarette although I am still using snus.
What the hell is in the cigs that I am not getting from snus?

FYI, The snus goes out the window in a few days, tried stopping both cold turkey but that was too much for me.

Anyone with some "inside information" on this?

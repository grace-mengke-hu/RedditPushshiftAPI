An easy ride... until these week 6 cravings hit

I am about 6 weeks into my quit. It has somehow been the easiest thing I've ever done. I've barely craved. I've had casual patio drinks and way too many campfire drinks and been clubbing and camping and hiking and to the beach. I've seen my non-smoking parents and chain-smoking friends and spent days without seeing anyone at all. I feel like I've hit every trigger possible at this point, but now, six weeks in, I've been getting the worst cravings of my entire quit.

I don't feel like my life has actually changed much since my quit, except that I'm maybe a little happier and a bit less smelly. I do have more free time, as I'm not wasting 5 min x 15 cigarettes a day (an hour and 15 minutes every day, over 55 HOURS in the last 6 weeks), but really that just gets folded into other tasks. I've spent my new found non-smoker wealth on upgrading my hiking gear. Life is, ostensibly, NORMAL. So WHY NOW?

What is it about NOW, after all of this, that is making me want to cave and buy a pack? I've been thinking about it non-stop for days. There are supposed to be no triggers left! Tell me I'm an idiot, please!

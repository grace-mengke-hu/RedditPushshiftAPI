My friend is trying to quit and gave me his cigarettes. How should I go about helping him?

He just came back from a gap year in Europe where he started smoking. He confided in me that he started, and doesn't want me telling any of our friends. For context, we are all in college, he is a friend from high school and we are all back over the summer. He wants me to help him quit, and I am overjoyed that I can help him. However I don't know the best way to go about this. He says just to give him one a day, and when the pack runs out that will be it. But is it better to go cold turkey? I don't want him to resent me or anything like that for not giving him any at all, and he can always go and buy more if I hold back. What are your thoughts on this? How can I help him best?

My Mindset Towards Addiction.

To celebrate my half a month free of cigs I just wanted to share my philosophy towards addiction.

I have quit looking at porn and quitting cigarettes both right around the same time. I have been doing the former for 12 years and the latter roughly 10. 

I see addictions as that lazy, house guest who sleeps on your couch without paying rent, eats your groceries, borrows your cell phone and runs up your bill, and tracks there shitty muddy shoes on your carpet. 

The fact of the matter is, you HAVE to kick them out. It's not an option. In the first few weeks, you will most likely miss them, and miss them dearly. You will make up all these phony redeeming qualities about them. 

You will miss all those hilarious jokes they crack and how they kept you company. 

But you know what?? FUCK 'EM! You have a life to live kid. Now that they are gone, you don't have to worry about your cell phone bill getting run up, your place smells better and your carpet is cleaner, you don't have to worry about all the mooching. 

Good luck and STAY STRONG! You got this!!!

About to smoke my LAST cigarette! Wish me luck!

I have been a pack a day smoker for the past 11 years. I have quit a couple of times but always fall off the wagon, hard. I am so ready to be done. I am a 26 year old decent looking lady with a gnarly smokers hack, its seriously disgusting. The price of cigarettes in my area is up to $16. That is an obscene cost to be spending every day. I'm going out to the garage to smoke the last one, then having a nice hot bath with all of the nice smelling things that will finally linger on my skin rather than be replaced with the smell of smoke in a couple of hours. I just wanted to introduce myself and post to make myself accountable. Happy to meet you all : )

My Secret Double Life

I was hoping to hear some other peoples stories and thoughts on this. I smoked for years while hiding it from my parents. Looking back, I'm sure they knew. Whenever I came home from college for a weekend or whatever, I was craving a cig the whole time. Sometimes I'd sneak out and drive around and chain smoke a few.

I started dating this amazing girl while I was smoking. She hated it, and I wanted to quit anyways, so I quit. I still smoked on and off for a while while hiding it from her. I'd smoke with friends and make sure to shower, put on clean clothes, and brush my teeth before meeting up with her. I was just so disappointed in myself that I couldn't bear having her be disappointed in me too.

Since I've quit, my anxiety has lessened a bit. I no longer have that fear of being "found out." I don't have to hide cigarettes or lighters or try to erase or mask the smell. I feel free.

Anyone else go through all of this? Wanna share your thoughts or stories on the secret double life?

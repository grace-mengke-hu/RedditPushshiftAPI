Bloody hell!

I can not believe that it has been 49 days!!!! It feels like a million years ago! I still get those moments where I desperately want to smoke but most of the time I don't even think about smoking at all. I can't believe how easy it has become. I used to update my smoking app every day and come on this reddit at least three times a day. This is no longer the case :D I don't really use either any more but both are still there in case I need them which is a great help! Thanks very much guys and good luck to any newbies :)

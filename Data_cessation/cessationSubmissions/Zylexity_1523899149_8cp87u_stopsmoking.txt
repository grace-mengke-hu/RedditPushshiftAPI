Anyone else have this weird feeling too?

I quit all 17 days ago and its been a pretty good time so far.  Cravings are minimal now, but I just have this constant feeling of something missing.  It feels like my body knows it wants something all the time but it's not really a bad *craving*.

Anyone else just have this almost constant feeling of weirdness? Like something is missing, but it's not directly related to smoking and its not really a craving.  It kind of feels like a permanent craving but very very very subtle.

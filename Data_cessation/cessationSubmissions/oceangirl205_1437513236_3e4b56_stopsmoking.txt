49/f Scratchy and hoarse voice since 2012 and getting worse PLEASE HELP

I went to the doctor back in 2012 when I had health Insurance and they did a laryngoscopy and found  throat polyps. They were going to do a biopsy and I NEVER returned. I lost my job, and Insurance. My home foreclosed and my  auto was repossessed. Its been extremely tough dealing with depression and on top of that this throat issue is getting WORSE. When I talk to people that I don't know over the phone they constantly mistake me for a man because of my voice.  My throat is always red and in the back of throat when I look in the mirror it looks swollen  to the right side. Any advice would be gladly appreciated. I am not going to lie. I have been a heavy smoker for years and I am now living with my 23 year old son who is totally against me smoking and has bought me a VAPE to help me stop. I have been smoking for about  25 years. You would think the unknown would make me quit all together but when I get stressed at times the vape doesn't seem to work. PLEASE  HELP

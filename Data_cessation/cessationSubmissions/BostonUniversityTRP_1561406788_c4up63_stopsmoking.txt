Adult Smoking Behaviors Study at Boston University

 

**Are you interested in seeing if you could quit smoking for one day?**

The Translational Research Program is currently conducting research examining different strategies to help people tolerate a 1-day quit period. Participants are asked to come in to the research program offices (on the second floor of 900 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, 02215) for an assessment visit, followed by individual 90-minute treatment sessions over the following three weeks, and two assessment visits the following week. This study is reserved for individuals and families with low income. Participants can earn up to $198 for completing all study visits.

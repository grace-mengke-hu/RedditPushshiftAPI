How long before you trusted yourself enough to have a drink again?

My friend is having a little going-away get together at the local brewery tonight, and it's only been 3 days since I quit, and drinking is a big trigger for me. I don't want to isolate myself by not going, and I want to be able to have a beer with everyone, but I'm worried about it. How long did it take before you were able to do that kind of thing again?

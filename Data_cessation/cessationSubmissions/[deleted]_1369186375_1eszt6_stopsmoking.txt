Drinking while quitting smoking.

I have drank a little since I've quit and I didn't have an overwhelming temptation to smoke so tonight I was going to relax and drink a little. I would like to know, however, if it is unhealthy chemically to drink during nicotine withdrawal. I know withdrawal is a symptom of your brain returning to the state it was in before nicotine and I want to make sure I won't muck anything up while drinking during this healing period.

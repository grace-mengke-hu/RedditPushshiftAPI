First timer here, have a dew questions.

First time seriously trying to quit here. I got easyway off of amazon a few days ago, and I have a few question.Will getting out of the house help? I have a sink full of dishes, an a bunch of other cleaning projects to keep me busy on this first day. But when im done do you think going out for some lunch or something will help or hinder the process?Is smoking pot a help or hindrance? As legal Oregon smoker, I toke daily, but im worried I might feel more inclined to reach for a cigg when I toke. Has anyone here tried to quit while smoking pot?Last one: Should I throw out my last couple smokes or keep a couple for emergency? Like if I can't make it, ill have a couple just in case.If anyone has any other advise for me please do share, ill be checking back in regularly all day. Ps: sorry for walloftext

At 7 weeks in, I figured the triggers were over. No. No, they are not.

Having a fight with my husband and in the past I'd escape him with a long smoking session while outside. I don't really want a cigarette and I'm certainly welcome to go out side if I like...it's just a trigger, one I haven't faced yet. It will be over eventually. Meh.

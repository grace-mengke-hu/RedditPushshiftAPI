Bloating?

Hey guys! I'm just a couple days in to 0 cigs. Is it normal to bloat? I'm eating and exercising about the same, but I'm appearing very bloated and my weight even went up. This normal? Everywhere I look, it says it's normal IF I replaced cigs with food, which isn't the case at all. 

Anyway, thanks for any light you might be able to shed on this phenomenon.

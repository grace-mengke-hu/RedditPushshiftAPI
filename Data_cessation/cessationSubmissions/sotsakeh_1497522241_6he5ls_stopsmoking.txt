Do not think!

I made it. I can not believe I made it. 
After 20 years 1 year smoke free. 

There were many obstacles and many fights. I still want a cigarette from time to time. Specially when I'm stressed. But the urge is very soft, so soft that even my sometimes also soft resilience can handle it. 

The best advice I can give for the long run is: do not think... 
You made your decision.

Do you want to touch a unknown beauty on the street sometimes? Do you want to stick your finger in the chocolate cake at the bakery and taste it? You do not have to do it and (hopefully) you do not do it. More importantly we do not only not do it, but we do not obsess about it. But with fags, we think, we obsess and we cave... I did it many times ... Remember I'm talking about the quitting attitude of long time smokers after a few month. 

When I realized I can smoke, but I don't have to and it is the same choice as to grab someone by the covfefe
a short pleasure for a long time in jail (for most of us)
It got way easier to resist...

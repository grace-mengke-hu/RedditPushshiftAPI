I caved. :(

SO last week was terrible.  Many bad things happened and also [insert random excuse here]  I so desperately want to quit and stay quit.  I have had great success with the Allen Carr book but have found in the past when i relapse that i need to smoke for a while before i can absorb the message again.  I do not want to wait.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what else i can try?

How long does it take for the lungs to cleanse themselves?

Apologies if this is a topic that's been beaten into the ground. I did a search in the sidebar but found nothing.
I've been having issues with my voice since quitting, particularly my singing voice. I'm not a musician so it's not a real issue, but it's frustrating. I can't get to notes that were no problem before. I'd read that it's common for vocal chords to become irritated until they cleanse themselves after smoking but I'm not coughing much anymore, and when I do, it's dry. Wondering if my issue is something unrelated at this point. Either way, I'm planning to drink far more water from now on.

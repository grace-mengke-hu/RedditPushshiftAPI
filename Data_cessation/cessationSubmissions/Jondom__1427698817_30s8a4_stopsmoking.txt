Not even day two

Hello fellow stosmokers.
I attempted to quit smoking *yet again* and this morning I kept telling myself "I am not going to smoke today," I probably thought it about 10-15 times. However, as I left my house I literally went down the road to buy cigarettes. I have a strong urge to smoke right now. Help me please!

Recently went to the doctor because of chest tightness and trouble breathing. It has to happen now.

After 2 weeks of dealing with those symptoms, I went to the doctor, got X-rays, etc done, and he warned me that I was showing the early warning signs of COPD and that if I didn't quit soon it would likely be irreversible. I'm only 26 and that scared the shit out of me. I've quit a few times (once for 3 months) but always relapsed. That can't happen this time. Day 1, here we go.

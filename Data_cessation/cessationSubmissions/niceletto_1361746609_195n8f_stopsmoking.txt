Need to quit - not sure how to get through cravings

25 y/o guy from Vegas - need to get myself in better health through no smoking/drinking/caffeine, fitness & diet. Just finished nursing school with plans to join the Air Force in a few months. Unfortunately I was up to 8 cigarettes a day for about 3 weeks. Usually I can get myself down to 3 cigarettes a day without craving more, buuuuuuuut yeah, definitely going to need help in getting through the cravings to get down to zero. Thought I'd look to this subreddit for help from people who have gotten through it. I'm sure the # of cigarettes a day are nominal compared to others, but it's still rough :/

Any help for a guy who wants to get his health back on track?

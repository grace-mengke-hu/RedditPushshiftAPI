52 days and I smoked today

Usually a lurker here but some people knew the account was me and didn't know about my smoking. So here we are.

I feel absolutely disgusting and I regret it so much. I even noticed how much I could inhale as my lungs seemed to be more functional.

At such a low, both mentally and physically, now.

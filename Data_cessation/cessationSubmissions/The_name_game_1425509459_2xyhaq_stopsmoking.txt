Want to try again, but probably won't.

Here we are again. I want to give up, I need to give up but I just can't do it. 
I have Allen Carr's Easyway book on my tablet, I have read 5 pages. I keep thinking about when I don't smoke how healthy I'll be, how much more money I'll have, how much more energy I'll have. And I keep smoking. 

I set dates, New Years, tomorrow, next week, next month, and I keep buying cigarettes. 

I gave them up before, was off them for 2.5 years with the Easyway. I gave up when I was pregnant, no hassle. But I just can't do it now. 

I smoke a lot. I am scared of the withdrawal. I don't think the Easyway will work again. I don't want the pangs, the need, the side effects and the endless thinking about cigarettes. 

I am a coward, who is committing the slowest  form of suicide possible.

I quit smoking three weeks ago and I don't feel good.

33 years old. Smoked for 15 years. New baby. So I quit with the patch and an occasional puff on an e-cig.

I don't feel good. Well, my respiratory system feels much better. I was constipated. I wasn't sleeping well. Those have gotten better, but not great. I put on weight. I have a gut and my clothes don't fit well. I feel like a slob. I'd go to the gym more but I have a baby at home. I only have a couple hours after work to spend with him so I end up doing that. I'm grumpy and irritable.

Ugh, I just don't feel good. I know I have to quit but I don't feel good. I thought this would be more rewarding.

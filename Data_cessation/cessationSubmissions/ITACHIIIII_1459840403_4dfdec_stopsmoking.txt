Break conditioning with alcohol

hey

I've got a question regarding my smoking habits and how to break them. I know I am a smoker and I'm addicted, but maybe in a unusual way. I never smoked when I'm on a normal day. I never smoked at school, never at university and also not at my job.

But I have a problem when it comes to alcohol. I'm german, so I was allowed to drink beer in the age of 16. At the same age I started smoking when I had a few beer.
As I said, I never smoked the "real" way, on a regular daily basis. I recently had 1 1/2 years without alcohol (because of weight reduction) and didn't smoke any cigarette then. Then I drank two or three beer at a party and had the first cigarette since ages, together with beer. What the fuck. I knew about the problem and my main goal that evening was NOT TO SMOKE. But I failed it so hard. As a teacher I know from university that this is a classical type of conditioning.

The only thing I don't know is how to break it. I'm really helpless at the moment. Quit alcohol for months is obviously not the solution. I think maybe I have to train it. Higher the alcohol dosis until I get the need to smoke, then stop. That's my next try.

Do you have any tipps regarding this problem?

Thanks!

PS: Completely quit drinking alcohol is not an option. As bad as it sounds: at least beer and cider belongs to the german culture and also my whole social environment.

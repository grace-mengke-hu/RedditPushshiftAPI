7 days and I'm raging

I didn't smoke much, maybe 5-10 Marlboro lights per day, for two years.

Now I've not had one in 7 days, I feel no different from the day that I stopped. Cravings are just as strong.

The hardest thing is that I have no reward for doing something. When I smoked I'd write some code, or get some unit tests passing, then I'd head out for a smoke as a pat on my own back, or I'd eat lunch and I'd think at the end of this I will make a nice cup of tea, and sit in the sunshine and have a smoke.

Now I feel that I have no incentive to do anything.

Ah well, I'm still not going to give into temptation and have one, but right now I miss it so much.

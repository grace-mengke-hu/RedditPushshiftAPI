A few things I have noticed about stopping smoking after a month

In my case, it has not only changed my bad habit, but its changed my whole lifestyle, smoking was holding me back in more ways than my health, and these are a few things I have really noticed over my journey:

-Waking up feeling well rested and refreshed in 1000x easier

-There so many weird and interesting smells and tastes that smokers miss out on.

-You start to almost pity smokers you pass by on the street because you feel that you have discovered something that they haven't.

-You find an old piece of clothing back from when you smoked and you realise just how much the smell of smoke clings to you, no just to your fingers and breath, but to everything, and how strong it is.

-Its a strange and foreign feeling to not have your hands smell like smoke.

-The amount of energy that you have when not under the constant influence of a suppressant is unreal.

-The amount of money and spare time that piles up from not smoking is much more than you thought.

-You just generally feel a whole lot better all the time.

-Quitting smoking really isn't that hard, you just need to really want it.

Theres my two cents, hope it motivates someone in some way

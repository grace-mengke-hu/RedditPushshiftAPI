Today is the day.

After many failed attempts at quitting, and having countless “quit dates”, last night I️ decided mid-smoke to quit.  Today is the day. However, I take adderall. I swear my craving for a cigarette intensifies SO much  while I️m on I‎t. I notice when I am not taking I‎t I only smoke 3-4 a day. On I‎t I️m smoking about half a pack if not more. Anyone have any tips for a combination like this to help ease my urge?

Triumphant weekend

Hi friends,

I just returned home from a weekend spent at the shore, and I am feeling victorious. 

The weekend is a huge craving trigger for me, being at the shore is a huge craving trigger for me, and this weekend I had both of those together. I had a blissful weekend at the shore, free of the overhanging mental impairment of feeling helplessly bound to the cigarettes. 

The cravings did pop up as Friday and Saturday night wore on - and during the day on Saturday I stumbled across a pack of cigarettes that I had left behind weeks ago to be had at another time. In an encouraging surprise to myself, I persevered. Having one smoke-free weekend under my belt, I think, was a huge help. 

How were your weekends and how are you feeling?

Cheers.

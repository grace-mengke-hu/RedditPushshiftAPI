It's officially been over a week, my dudes

I haven't gone this long without smoking in over five years. It's been ONE WEEK and I'm so proud of myself. My coughing has also  lessened significantly. 

But the withdrawal symptoms are no joke. During that first week I couldn't sleep more than four hours a night and the headaches were awful. I felt overwhelmed and frustrated with myself; it almost felt like sensory overload mixed with brain fog and it was especially bad because I live in a big city.

I can't wait until these symptoms go away.

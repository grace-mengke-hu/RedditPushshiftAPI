Can't believe I relapsed over 211 days because I nearly broke up with my GF

I nearly broke up with my GF of 2 years over the weekend for stupid reasons over the weekend, had my first drink of alcohol last night in over a year, came home and she was sleeping waiting to move out today and I couldn't sleep and bought a packet of cigarettes.  Today just as she was about to move to her new house that I paid the deposit for I had this big feeling that I was going to regret this and we got back together.

The reason I tried to break it off were selfish, because I have had a lot of girls flirt with me during the last few weeks and I am not used to this, one even asked me out...It made me think superficially which was the wrong thing to do.. we've had a couple of moments like this but I am glad now since I don't think I would ever find a GF the same

I will go back to my e-Cigarette now, real cigarettes are disgusting after 211 days... I've struggled with this habit on and off the last 12 years, I'm 31.

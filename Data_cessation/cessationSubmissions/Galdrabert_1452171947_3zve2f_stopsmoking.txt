Panic attacks/Anxiety

Hey everyone!

It's been 10days without a smoke and 6 days without nicotine and I'm feeling confident! 

But last Sunday I had this mild panic attack and didn't worry too much about it. Yesterday I had another one and I have these strong feelings of anxiety today. 

Is this normal when quitting smoking? Have you experienced this? How did you deal with it?



Edit: I should add that I am a healthy 20year old male. I work out 6x a week and eat healthy. 

(I felt like an idiot smelling like cigarettes at the gym)

Withdrawal

So some of these symptoms I’ve read about and some I have not and I’m wondering if anyone else dealt with this or if I’m just sick. It’s been about two weeks since i stopped habitually smoking and about a week in I started feeling awful. My throat hurts and my nose constantly runs. I’m constantly thirsty and hungry. I feel almost feverish. Anyone else got these?

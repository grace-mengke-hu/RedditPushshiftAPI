Day 19 Mission...

Here's a list of a few things that have helped me so far. There are definitely a lot more useful things, but these have helped... 
-Chewing Gum
-Deep Breaths
-Brushing My Teeth
-Taking A Shower
-Exercise
-Calling Someone Or Texting Someone
-Going Onto Stop Smoking Forum
-Looking At The Progress On My Smoke Free App.

Hopefully, these might help somebody!

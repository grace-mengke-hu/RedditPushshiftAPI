Day 16 complete

Nothing much happened in the last 16 hours, no cravings. I feel a little pain occasionally on the front and side of the lungs region. Probably its related to quitting.

Secondly, I will be alone for the next 3 days starting today. I am craving for cigarettes. My mind says that its ok to smoke the three days and then quit it. Three days doesnt make a difference since I will quit after then, it says. My main challenge is to not to smoke these three days. Hopefully I will make it.

13 Days - I've started to forget, for hours at a time, that I even used to smoke.

I smoked for 10 years, anywhere from 5-10 per day.  Quit cold turkey because I despise having to stand outside in a new england winter to suck smoke into lungs that already hurt from the sharp cold.

I'm about 50/50 between "wow I'm not craving anything right now" and having that achy feeling.  I try not to think about smoking when I get like that, just to continue to break the association.  It's like a headache or a cold.  Just minor discomfort.  

Also my dreams are vivid (really awesome) and my mouth is always kind of watery.  I'm really looking forward to when my lungs heal and finally feel better.   I still read here constantly, but not as the lifeline that it was in the beginning.  Today it's like wearing a retainer - I'm not even giving these cravings a chance to get ugly.

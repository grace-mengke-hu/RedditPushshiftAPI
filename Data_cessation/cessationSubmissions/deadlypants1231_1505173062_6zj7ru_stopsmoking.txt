Difficult Time at Home

My marriage is not doing well. I have felt distant from my wife since the beginning of our marriage. I just never felt attached emotionally tied with her and I think it was my nicotine addiction that made me numb to that. I went just two days without nicotine and felt overwhelmed with positive emotion toward her. I cried for a few hours.  I am now on day 3 and feel as if I am experiencing a rich life for the first time in 10 years. I know there will be some difficult times ahead, but I know that suffering those hard times without nicotine is better than numbing myself to the good times. Good luck friends

Really glad this sub exists

I've been on /r/stopdrinking and /r/leaves for a while and never thought to look for a stop smoking sub. I'm 21 and have been smoking since 18, and now have my longest time without a cigarette. 8 days! I can't even imagine how black my lungs must be, but I'm excited that I'll be able to go on runs soon without feeling like I'm gonna die. LPT to anyone that's never smoked: **don't start**. They're freaking delicious and deadly.

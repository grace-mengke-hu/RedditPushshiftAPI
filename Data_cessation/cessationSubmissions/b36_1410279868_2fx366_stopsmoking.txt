Hi, r/stopsmoking. I have smoked half my life and I want to quit but I don't know where to start

Some say the only thing to do is to not smoke. Just don't do it. But I find it hard to do so. 
I have smoked since I was 13 and I am now 30. What is some good advice for me as a newb? 

Thanks for any advice. 

EDIT:

Thanks for all your answers! I have decided to give it a try right now. An advice I was given was to wait a couple of days just to prep my mind for it, but I'm out of cigs and I'm going to bed (I live in Norway). Tomorrow I'll go for a morning jog or/and bikeride instead of that morning smoke and coffee. Wish me luck, and thanks again!

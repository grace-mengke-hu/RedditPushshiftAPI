The view from 2 months

Background: 20-a-day 22-year-old, quit just over 2 months ago on my second attempt. Both times I used Allen Carr's Easyway book. I decided to quit because it was affecting my health, mood, money and 100 other things. Most of all, however, I was ashamed, embarrassed and miserable to be a smoker. Here are things i've learned. 

1. After a 2 months of not smoking I began to think of myself as a non-smoker rather than an ex-smoker.
2. Yesterday was the first day for 6 years where I did not think about smoking once, it's actually possible. 
3. People will tell you it's the hardest thing. Quitting smoking is easy provided you are sure of 3 things; a) I want to quit smoking b) This is going to be the time I quit forever c) I can and will never smoke again.
4. I still have vivid dreams about smoking and feel horrible guilt and shame after breaking my quit until I wake up. 
5. Using an app such as "QuitIt" can really help. It shows you how far you've come and how much you have to lose in a moment of weakness. 
6. Nicotine gums, nicotine patches, e-cigs etc will keep you hooked on nicotine. You need to quit and never look back. 
7. This might be the most important; ramp up to a quit attempt. Think about it seriously for a significant amount of time and know that this one is for real. Waking up one morning with a sore throat and thinking "That's it. I'm never smoking again" will probably fuel a quit attempt that lasts until the same evening. Don't bother. Smoke until smoking makes you miserable and you realise that quitting is a huge gain, not a loss. 
8. Marvel every single day at how far you've come, people will try to encourage you, especially non-smokers, but they won't understand. You and you alone have to encourage yourself through the quit. Be your own no.1 fan and realise that smoking is going to kill you and you need to be willing to die to quit.

Today's the day! 

I still have about a third of Carr's book to go, but something funny happened yesterday. It was about 5 PM and I ran out of smokes (I'd found myself cutting back more and more as I've been reading). Normally I would have walked down to the store right away to pick more up... but this time I had no desire to. I made it through the whole night without even craving one. Cut to this morning and I woke up without coughing fits for the first time in a long while. I'm still going to finish Carr's book, but I *know* that I'm ready to quit now. Wish me luck!

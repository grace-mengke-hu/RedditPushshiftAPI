Patches, no. Gum, no. Willpower, no. E cig, yes. 

I have tried everything and I finally found the miracle way out of overpriced cancer. I forced a few of my smoker friends to try vaporizers and they no longer smoke.

I recomend an ego twist battery and any atomizer that fits. Youtube it and read about it. It will likely work for you. I have never seen it fail when someone researches it and does not buy overpriced e cigs from gas stations or malls. Message me if youre finished killing yourself.

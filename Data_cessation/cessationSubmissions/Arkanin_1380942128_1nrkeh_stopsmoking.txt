Smoked again for the first time in 2 years... how likely is relapse?

Hey all, I don't usually drink but on a whim I downed about 8 beers and started feeling the overwhelming urge to smoke... I was jonesing so bad I felt like a meth addict, in fact I was doing my best Tyrone Biggums impression for my wife telling her that was how I felt. Honest to god I'm tyrone biggums. I was convinced I wouldn't sleep at all if I didn't smoke tonight and I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it until I caved. In fact, I've been wanting to smoke really bad for the last couple months, way more than before. I was cool for years but not in the last months.

So I bought a pack, then started smoking, I smoked about half of a cigarette (3 long drags) and then I was just paralyzed, I realized fucking this up would wreck my self esteem. I was paralyzed for a minute with half a cigarette in my hand, it burned out then I threw the rest of the pack off my balcony.

Anyway, how much damage has half a cigarette done to the last two years. Is this something you can recover from? How bad is this incident gonna be for the addiction I've been trying to patch up for years? Am I gonna be jonesing for a cigarette like a fiend tomorrow? Did I just royally shit up my brain chemistry?

I'm just trying to figure out what to expect. Thanks.

E: And thanks everyone for your support. Pretty sure I'm gonna be ok as of this morning. I needed to be told "just drop em again" and I appreciate hearing that from all of you.

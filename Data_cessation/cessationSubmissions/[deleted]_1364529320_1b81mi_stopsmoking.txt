easiest and most effective way to stop smoking! no hoax, no shock treatment. period.

hey!

i'm sharing what helped me to become a non-smoker over night, after 14 years of being *20 a day* smoker: [allen carr's **easyway to stop smoking**](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easyway-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364527759&sr=1-1&keywords=allen+carr).

this method's failure rate is under 5%. there is no hoax, no shock treatment nor agony during the reading of this book. best of all, the author insists you to smoke until you're finished with the book.

the method explains very clearly the reasons **why it *is* so hard to quit**. also removes all fallacies and illusions that keep us in the smoking trap for life. please give this book a read if you're serious about escaping the lifetime of slavery to the weed.

ps. there should be a pdf of this book lingering on the internets.

My A.D.D. Seems to be Much Worse

So, before I started smoking, I was diagnosed with A.D.D. and was on medicine for it.  About a year after my diagnosis, I picked up smoking and stopped taking my medicine.  

Now, five years later, I've quit smoking and it's been 85 days since my last smoke(YAY!).  My A.D.D. is back with a vengeance and it's gotten so bad that my superior has started to pick up on it.  That never happened when I was a smoker.  

My question is, has anyone else experienced a similar issue?  I want to know if it's normal for people who have quit.  It's almost like because smoking gave me a schedule to live my life by and now that's gone and I don't know how to manage.  

I've got an appointment to see my doctor next week to discuss options, just wanted to get reddit's thoughts.

Tonight quitting smoking crossed my mind.. Not the first time it did.

I've been smoking for 4 years. Not consistently but still.. Periods of my life when I was smoking a lot, especially when drinking. I think alcohol is a huge trigger to cigarettes. If you're gonna quit one thing you better quit both.
The most i managed to go without cigarettes is about 3 months. My friends and I were chilling at a house party, more like a get together. It really wasn't a full on party. A friend of mine, Marko, said to me:''oh Filip you can't live with outh those cigarettes'', as I was inhaling the smoke. To that I replied:'' oh you know I can. '' We there made an agreement in which I would not smoke a cigarette for 3 months.
I truly did respect that agreement.
After three months and there some I lit a cig.
Started smoking occasionally and then the excuse was oh I will just smoke when I drink. I started drinking more often. Then I said I'd smoke ehrm I had my coffee... Started smoking again.
Periods like this repeated during those 4 years of me meeting with nocitne.
Tonight a realization popped into my mind that I should decide if I'm going to stick with cigarettes or leave them for good.
I hope this community is supportive as 
r/stopgamimg community.
Any tips for quitting smoking. I'm surrounded with smokers and like a huge percentage of my country's population is actually smoking.
Just came home from a night out where I drank a bit but didn't get wasted and got choked from the cigarettes smoke.

Day One (8 hours free)

Spent the past hour reading this subreddit and downloaded the smoke free app. Decided after the Super Bowl that I wanted to try and quit cause I am starting to feel the effects of those skinny white assholes. Started smoking regularly at 18 and now I am 28 and feel I am ready. Tried two years ago and lasted 2 weeks, until I drank, then it was over. Plan on going cold turkey and not drinking for the first month.  TBH, not really sure what the next 48 hours are going to be like and I also will be driving for 3+ hours tomorrow for a job interview (driving = smoking and being stressed/nervous AKA pretty much setting myself up for prime temptation)

Anyway from what I've read so far on here, seems like a place I will be spending some time at as I begin this journey... any words of advice or encouragement will help a striving to be non-smoker out..

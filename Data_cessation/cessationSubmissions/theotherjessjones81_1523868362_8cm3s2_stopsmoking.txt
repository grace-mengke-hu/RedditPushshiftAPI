Getting through...

I'm working on my 2nd day without a cigarette. I'm using an ecig to help with the cravings, and so far it seems to be mostly doing the trick. I want to try to have a baby some time in the next year, and I'm just trying to get myself healthy before then. Thanks for reading, and for your encouragement. It means so much!

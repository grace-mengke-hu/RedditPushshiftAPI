Quitting was going easy and then this happened....

On Halloween I got extremely drunk like any college kid dressed up as a vampire would do and went to a party. there were a lot of smokers at this party and i ended up splitting 3 cigs with my friend throughout the entire night. 

Before quitting I was easily at half a pack a day on your average day and  a pack a day on a night I was drinking, so of course splitting three cigs wasn't anything like I would normally have done in the past, but since then Ive been having horrible cravings.

Before halloween once i got past the 2 week mark i didnt have any cravings. Halloween it was more of a social smoke than anything and drunkly reverting back to old habits, but my god the cravings now are killing me. i just want a cigarette :(

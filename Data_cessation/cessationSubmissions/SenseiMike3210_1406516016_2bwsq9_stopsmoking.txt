Thinking about quitting and I had a few questions

So I'm about a half a pack a day smoker and have been for about 2 years. I hate how it gets in the way of doing shit I want to do. For example, I'm going on a trip with my family next weekend and all I can think about is "when am I going to get a chance to sneak off and smoke?" "how many can I expect to fit in per day?" "maybe I'll smoke my e-cig in the bathroom or something." (Not that my family doesn't know I smoke, I just don't want to smoke in front of them) I don't want to deal with that anymore so I've been considering just quitting (sitting here trying out e-cigs right now to see how that works out) But I don't know what to expect. Can anyone give me an idea of what you feel for the first couple of days? weeks? After a month? And, something that's really been on my mind, will I always crave cigarettes?

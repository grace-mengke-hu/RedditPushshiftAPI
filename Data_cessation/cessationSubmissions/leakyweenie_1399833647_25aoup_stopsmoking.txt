Quit date

I decided a couple of months ago that my quit date would be when I moved to my new apartment. Headed into the last few weeks of my current residence I can already feel the anxiety of trying to quit. Wondering if you all had any advice for the next couple weeks before I try to quit completely on cutting down, and such. I've done things like cut out smoking after most meals and stuff of that nature, but what other advice may you have to offer? Thanks in advance.

The Early Morning Cigarette Is The Easiest Kick!

In my opinion...so much nicotine has left your body overnight because those are the hours you didn't refuel your nicotine craving, when those voices in your mind start chattering about how bad they want a cigarette, just know that that's the nicotine monster clawing at you trying to be fed....I'm about to go to the gym! Have a great day!

If you have trembles or shake that can become permanent nerve damage.

Nicotine affects the nerve-muscle junctions, causing tremors and shaking. In high concentrations nicotine acts as a nerve poison and it is used in insecticides. Cigarette smoking may lead to nerve damage and demyelination in the brain.

I tried to help a coworker quit and she shook all day no matter what she was doing. Just wanted to shed some light on the symptoms you may be having in the hopes that it pushes you to kick the habbit.

Good luck.

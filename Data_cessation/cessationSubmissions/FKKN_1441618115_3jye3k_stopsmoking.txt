I've been cutting back and trying to quit for weeks...

So, it's been a stressful time in my life, I've had relatives pass away, had a cruddy time at a new job, etc, etc. 

So, long story short, I've been on nicotine patches for a few weeks now, been playing around with ecigarettes, and it's all taken me far too long to have that "final" cigarette. I gave myself an ultimatum yesterday that the packet I had would be my last, I would not buy another. I had around 20 left in it.

Some prick (and/or pricks) stole it off my balcony last night (accessible from ground floor), and I've kept to my ultimatum, not had a single one, not bought another packet, and I live with another smoker (who's also got stolen).

Day one, tell me it gets easier?

9 Months!

Never thought I'd do it, even as early as this time last year while I still had a 3/4ths pack a day habit.  I never thought I could.  

I went on my honeymoon cruise in May, and wasn't able to buy my brand/anything even remotely close.  Ever since then, I've been smoke free.  Great timing too, considering on the same honeymoon cruise my son was conceived, due any day now!

Just wanted to post this to give others encouragement. Sometimes life just helps you do what you need to do when you need to do it, without much struggle or complaint from you.

New Quitter, slight caveat

So after about 10-12 years of smoking (with a 1.5 year quitting stint about 3 years ago) I've decided I am done with this unhealthy, expensive and overall disgusting habit. I've always been a self-loathing smoker, as in I hate the smell, I hate having to separate myself from the group to do it, all that stuff.

I had one cigarette left in my pack yesterday morning, I had it, and haven't had one since. Hooray me. Feeling very on edge today, every little thing that gets added to my list of tasks at work is making me feel like the world is coming to an end, but it is what it is. 

The 'caveat' I mention in the title is that, this weekend I am going on a camping trip with my group of friends who all smoke, I basically know that I will cave this weekend and have a few (At least) so rather than let that pull me down, I am going to smoke this weekend, on the trip, after not having one all week, then jump back to quitting next Monday.

Does anyone have any experience with a hiatus like this? Does it ever work or will I just fall back into it?

Thanks.

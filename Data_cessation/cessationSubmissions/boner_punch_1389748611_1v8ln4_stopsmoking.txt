Asthma increased from quitting?

I have suffered from asthma my whole life but I feel like it has gotten much worse since I quit smoking.  The first few days I felt great but the last 3 days my breathing has been really shallow and I feel like I'm coughing more than when I smoked a pack a day.  To make matters worse, my inhaler ran out and I can't get a new one at the moment.  Has anyone else suffered anything similar while quitting?

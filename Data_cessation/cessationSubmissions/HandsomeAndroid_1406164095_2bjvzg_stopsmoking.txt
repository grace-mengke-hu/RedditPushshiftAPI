A week and 1 day and NOW the cravings come?

I knew it couldn't be this easy. I'm on day 8 and so far it's been the easiest quit I've ever attempted. I found the right combination of vaping with a side of nicorette and I've barely even thought about smoking since. Even being around other smokers hasn't phased me. Until today. I've been irritable all day and when I caught a whiff of someone smoking outside my apartment it sent my brain into "must smoke now" mode. I'm in need of some serious backup r/stopsmoking, please help!

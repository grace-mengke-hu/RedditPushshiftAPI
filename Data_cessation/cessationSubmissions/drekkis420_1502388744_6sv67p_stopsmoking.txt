Quit smoking and diet.

Hey guys. So I'm about to quit smoking again this weekend. I'm also 30 pounds overweight and I need a drastic diet change. My last quit attempt failed due to me trying to quit smoking and eating junk simultaneously. My question is, how long should I wait before I start making large diet changes? I don't want to start too early and crumble under the pressure.

17 year old cousin just told me she smokes

Hope I'm posting in the right place. I'm 26 and my 17 year old cousin, a girl, just told me she smokes. She told me over text and I'm not sure if I reacted the right way. I just started telling her all the negative aspects associated with cigarettes, and how I was sad to hear this. She got upset understandably, and I'm still pretty upset as I'm writing this. I was hoping to get some perspective and advice on what I should say or do. My cousin and I are pretty close and I don't know what to do. While we were texting I was about to say that I won't speak to her unless she stops but decided against it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

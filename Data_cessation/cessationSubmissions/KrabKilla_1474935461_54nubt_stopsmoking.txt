I want to quit smoking for good.

I started smoking when I was 21. I went from 3-4 cigarettes a day to 2 packs in a matter of a week and then I started taking out the filter. I went 4 years straight smoking 45ish cigarettes daily to quitting and going to vaping. It's been a year since I quit smoking cigarettes completely besides the one every 4 months or so when I get stressed out.

I want to quit for good and never come back, but i'm a stress smoker and I "chain smoke" when i'm stressed out. I would go through a pack in a matter of 3 hours when I was super stressed out. I am not sure how to break that habit. I "tried' once and I was clean for 2 days before I wanted to rip someones head off.

Any advice on staying committed? Nicotine gum is out of the question. I do not chew gum under any circumstance. 

Edit: I should add that I smoke 12 mgs when I vape.

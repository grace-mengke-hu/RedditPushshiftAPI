I’m bumping up my quit date

I had set a quit date of February 21, but my experience over the past few days with the patch + lozenges leads me to think I can do this earlier than that. I have two packs of cigarettes left in my cupboard, when I get to the end of the day that I would need to buy a pack for the next day, I’m throwing the rest of them out and quitting. Sort of begs the question why I don’t do that right now... I don’t know, I don’t feel like it! Haha :) wearing the patch I’ve realized I can get through the cravings, but it’s been a constant mental back-and-forth: “my quit date isn’t for another nine days so I can smoke now, and I sort-of want to but sort-of don’t want to, blah blah blah”... it’s just been annoying. So I’ve taken the patch off and I’m not putting it back on until I’m actually quitting. I guesstimate I will probably quit on Wednesday (Valentine’s Day, yeah! Good present to myself 😁).


Putting the patch on early was a very worthwhile exercise though. Secretly I hoped it would magically make me stop smoking as soon as I put it on; of course that wasn’t realistic, but it did show me that I can function and go out and do things without cigarettes and I won’t spontaneously combust or go completely mental when I quit. I was not sure what was going to happen! It will still be a battle of course, but I feel like I can do it. Also, it gave me a little taste of what life will be like once free from cigarettes: no more carrying them around everywhere! No more structuring the day around when I can get a smoke break! Totally free to do whatever, whenever! Three hour movie? No problemo! Flight to Australia? Why not! Yay!

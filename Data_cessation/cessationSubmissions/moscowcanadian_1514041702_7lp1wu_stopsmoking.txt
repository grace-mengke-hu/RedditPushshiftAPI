Wow one week! I'm doing well... so far

sooo I'm back home for break and have been just mellowing out and not doing anything... including smoking cigarettes! I've made it a week cold turkey and am determined to keep it up. Any advice for when I'm out socializing with friends and I'm offered a cigarette?

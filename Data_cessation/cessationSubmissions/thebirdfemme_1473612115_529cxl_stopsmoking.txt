I can't even imagine being a smoker anymore

Sure, i still think i want cigarettes sometimes, but that's few and far between and i recognize it's not a cigarette i actually want.

Anyway, whenever i walk past someone smoking or am next to a driver who's smoking, it just seems so... foreign to me. Like i can't even imagine walking around smoking a cigarette anymore. 

Keep on being non-smokers!

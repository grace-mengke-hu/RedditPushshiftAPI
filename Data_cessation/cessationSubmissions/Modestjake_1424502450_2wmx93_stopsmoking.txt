Aww yeah. It hasn't been as hard as expected.

Randomly, drunk and high I decided to quit cigarettes. I've been thinking about it for awhile and everything just kind of clicked when my best friend visited and told me he quit. So five nights ago I smoked a cig and then watched the faucet soak 17 cigarettes still in the pack.

It has not been as hard as I expected. The positives outweigh the negatives already. I've felt myself get the urge to exercise a lot more and my mood has been all around lifted. 

Keep on keeping on!

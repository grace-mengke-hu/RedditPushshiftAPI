My Journey starts now

I've just had my last cigarette, it's 23:20 in Portugal so tomorrow my journey starts. 

I'm writing this here because I want to have a safe place to document the first moments. So if nobody minds I'll be updating this as each craving comes and goes.

I've set up some safeguards to help trough this. The major one being that my wife is taking all my money and cards for the day, so that even if my brain decides to try and trick me I'll need to make a lot of effort in order to smoke. I've just taken every smoke related thing to the trash.

I've tried quitting other times (not really quitting but smoking less) and it never worked because I'm capable of rationalizing almost anything, but this time I'm truly motivated. 

This time I WILL MAKE IT.

Updates:

Day 1 09:00 : been up for about 1,5 hours and no major cravings yet, just feel my head a bit numbed

Day 1 12:00 : had a few cravings, started snapping at people for no real reason, but still have not smoked

Day 1 18:30 : almost caved in and tricked myself into buying a pack. 

Day 1 end: smoked 2. Lost this battle but not the war

Day 2 end: smoked 2. For me not the best outcome but still a slight win. And I'm not demoralized, I will make it this time.

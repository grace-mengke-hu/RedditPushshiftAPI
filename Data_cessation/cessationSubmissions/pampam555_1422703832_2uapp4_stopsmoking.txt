This week will be awful

I quit last week. Everything has been going great, the cravings weren't even that bad. But now im on holiday (the only time offschool ill get in a veeery long time) and dad took me to the countryside where theres nothing to do and time flies 20 times slower. Also its very cold here, i hate the bed and many other things about this place. I didn't bring cigarettes because I thought I wouldn't need any. There's no place here to buy any anyway. How do I make it 

edit: thanks guys. I had a friend give me a ride to the nearest town, and I still did not buy cigarettes.

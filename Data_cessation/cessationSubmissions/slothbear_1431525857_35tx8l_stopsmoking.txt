One week almost down. Feeling good-ish...

The day after tomorrow will mark one week without nicotine. I started sometime around 18, and now I'm 34. I never really tried to quit before, but in the middle of my bedtime smoke, I said that's it. The past six days have been rough, but it's getting a little better. I wake up easier, and am waaaay less grumpy in the morning. I can already breathe a little easier, and I don't feel like my heart is going explode after a little physical labor. Those feelings have been helping me through the cravings that are still hitting....probably 3 bad times a day, but so far so good! I've been lurking around this subreddit since I started stopping, and I just thought I'd say hi.

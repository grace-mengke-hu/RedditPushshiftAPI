I quit yesterday and I had no idea how rough it was going to be.

I’ve been smoking since I was 16, I’m now 22. Last year I quit cigarettes and moved entirely over to the juul; I almost regret this more than starting cigarettes. I have been going through at least one and a half pods a day (about a pack and a half of nicotine) and I’m crazy addicted to it. I have been wanting to quit since the beginning of this year and yesterday I actually took the plunge.  I know I was going to experience cravings, what I didn’t expect was the emotions that came with it all. I’m a manager and I ended up snapping at my partners, crying in the bathroom, and disassociating so badly I didn’t remember parts of the day. My brain fog was horrendous. I ended up breaking and bought a pack of cigs, I only had three, and I gave the rest to another coworker. Today I’m struggling not to buy more pods. It’s all too much. I have no idea what to expect if my first day was that hard. I want to quit but don’t know if I’m even strong enough. My juul makes me feel good and in control. I do not like all of this anger and turning of emotions.

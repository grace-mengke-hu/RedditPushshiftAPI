Day 5, toughest day at work so far

Been craving for cigarettes constantly for the past 3 hours, since lunch. For those of you who can relate, it's that familiar feeling of tension and vertigo in the mid section. 

The main thing I've learned from my 3 hour ordeal is that you shouldn't bother rationalizing not having a cigarette; it's difficult to reason your way out of a habit that impairs rational thinking. When the thought of smoking pops up, just entertain it at arm's length, continue breathing consciously and let it pass.

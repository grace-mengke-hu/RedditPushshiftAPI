217 Days !!!

I can't believe it , I actually made it this far in my journey , I smoked a pack a day for two years , and tried to quit in the past but didn't have so much confidence in me to succeed , I gradually started to hate the routine that this addiction had driven me into, One cig after eating , A cig to relax , the morning one etc . The problem is that your brain is like a spoiled kid that wants something , and will do everything in his power to get it , in this case the daily dose of Nicotine .  It will try to convince you that what you are doing is perfectly normal , " Hey , why do you want to quit , I mean look at these guys , they do it  , It's normal , Look at them , they are so happy , Pick one up and light it , don't suffer any longer " , then if that doesn't work , he will pull out the big guns , Carvings , Mood changes , Anxiety , that's when most of us let our guard down , and we give in , I have been there , and it's not worth it , after that cig , I was like " fuck , what I have I done"  , I became to judge myself for giving in and started doubting that this will ever going to work , that's when I started realizing that the hole point of a relapse is to discover what your weaknesses are and to improve your defence . On the night of 29th march I decided it was time for me to win this damn battle , I went cold turkey , The first week wasn't so bad , the second one is when the mood changes ocurred the difference was that this time I was prepared and I managed to restrain myself from snapping on people , the third week was alot better , thoes changes started to faid away , and by the time I had 1 month in , I was a changed man , I no longer had that taste in my mouth , I started to regain my running resistance ,  I could  breath a lot better , the biggest plus was that I regained my confidence in myself . It does get better , don't be too hard on yourself if you relapse , try to know your weakness and learn from your past mistakes  , and the most important one is to believe in yourself and don't let other people discourage you. :-)

Resources to help with quitting smoking?

Hello! I am a graduate student at the Human Centered Design and Engineering program at the University of Washington and am part of a group conducting research to better understand resources to help people quit smoking.

Are you currently smoking or have you smoked cigarettes in the past? If so, would you be willing to take this 5-minute survey? Your responses are anonymous and will solely be used for research purposes. Thank you so much in advance! :)

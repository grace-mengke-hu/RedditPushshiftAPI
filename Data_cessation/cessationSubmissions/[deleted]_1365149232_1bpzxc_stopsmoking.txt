1 month today

Today I received my 1 month badge and this is the furthest I've gone of all my previous attempts. I'm 27 and had been a pack-a-day smoker for 10 years. In my last attempt I tried a combination of gum and patch. I quickly became strongly addicted to the gum and due to overusage I went through painful sideffects such as chronic canker sores and receding gums. Then on an overseas trip to SEA I resumed smoking due to being unable to find the patch or gum for sale.

This time around I was on the patch for about 3 weeks (28mg) with some light exercise each day, but stopped the patch abruptly due to running out and not being able to make an appt. with my GP in time to get more. Now after a week off the patch, things are quite fine. Still the occasional craving, particularly when drinking alcohol or after a big meal, but nothing too extreme. I feel confident that I will succeed this time. My only concern is that I have begun too put on a few pounds around the belly, so now I am looking for a good way to diet. Probably should exercise more.

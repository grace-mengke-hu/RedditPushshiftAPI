No withdrawal?

First post in this sub & i'm wondering if anyone else had the same effect. I decided to quit (19 days ago) and I haven't had a single withdrawal symptom.  
  
I'm not sure if it had to do with the fact that I also quit taking adderrall for ADHD and the withdrawal from that masked the withdrawal from cigarettes.. or if its a combination of that and starting a new medication to help with ADHD called Wellbutrin...  
  
Wellbutrin can also be used for smoking cessassation, but is supposed to take 8 weeks to start working.  
    

Any insight?

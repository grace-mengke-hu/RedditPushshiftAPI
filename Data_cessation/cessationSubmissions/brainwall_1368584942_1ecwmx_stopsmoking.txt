Any thoughts on tobacco/nicotine free hookah or herbal cigarettes?

I'm reading through Allen Carr's book right now and it is helping a lot. One thing that has become clear is ABSOLUTELY NO NICOTINE! What are your thoughts on smoking tobacco/nicotine free hookah or tobacco/nicotine free herbal cigarettes? Just for the time being to kind of absorb that wanting to blow out smoke feeling? Or is this just a cop out?

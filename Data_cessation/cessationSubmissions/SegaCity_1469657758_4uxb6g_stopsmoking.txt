If nicotine is the addicting drug that keeps us smoking, is it possible to slowly lower your dosage in cigarettes and stop smoking?

I'm not saying the nicotine levels in cigarettes should be lowered entirely, but I think that if every brand had a pack for a number of different nicotine levels then maybe we can be more aware of how far our addictions are? 

I feel like our governments are taking the wrong road to fighting cigarette smokers. It seems like this is more of a psychologically effective drug and it's never portrayed like that. 

Does the government not want to be seen as drug sympathizers? 

I'm not very educated on the subject, I'll show some links I read on.

EDIT 1: By the way, I live in Ontario, Canada and I was curious about my cigarette packs' nicotine levels. Guess what, it wasn't there! It's as if they don't want me to know...

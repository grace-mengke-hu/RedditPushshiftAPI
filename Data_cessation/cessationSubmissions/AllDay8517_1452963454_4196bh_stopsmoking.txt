I quit 11 days ago...

So I quit, I was on the patch for 4 days and then went cold turkey. I have been without nicotine for over a week.

When do these cravings stop, I am a mess of a person now. I can't leave my apartment because I know I'm going to buy a pack. 

I know if I go back on the patch, to get through these hard parts, I'm just giving in. I want to be nicotine free and not rely on any crutch.

Also, I have been smoking way more pot. Is it just as bad to smoke pot instead of cigarettes? I used to smoke three or four times a week. Now I am smoking a bowl every time I want a cigarette.

To everyone who's in the first two weeks.....

We (quitters) have been through this. We all have. It's not easy, but it's the biggest achievement you can earn throughout your life. Yes, you will still get the odd craving, but you'll be in control soon enough.

It gets easier, you'll feel good. I don't remember feeling this good without a cigarette. 

To smokeless months ahead for all of us!

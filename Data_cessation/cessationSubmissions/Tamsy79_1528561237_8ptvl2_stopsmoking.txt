Feeling lost

2 days and 19 hours quit...did anyone else not want to get out of bed because they were scared? Its the weekend and I don't know what to do with myself. I have lots that I need to do. Housework, walk my dogs, work in my garden...but I always start my weekend days with some cups of coffee and cigarettes. Weekdays were easy. Get up and go to work. Not today...how do I get motivated?

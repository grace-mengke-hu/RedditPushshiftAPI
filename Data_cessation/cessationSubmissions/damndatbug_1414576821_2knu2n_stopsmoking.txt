I am going to quit.

Hi reddit. 
This is my first post ever. I wanted it to be for a good cause. I have decided to quit smoking after 6 years of doing it. I've come to hate it. Everything reeks of tobacco all the time. So, Should I quit cold turkey or should I go about it methodically? What tips do you have? What methods have you used? Will I feel all murdery on the inside? Thanks for the help!

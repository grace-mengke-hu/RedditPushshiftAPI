51 Days without drinking, but I started smoking instead

Clean in 2019 so far, but I feel like I've replaced a bad habit with another bad habit. I'm not buying any packs, but whenever people offer me cigs at work, I can hardly resist. It's a social thing I guess. When everyone else is smoking, I feel stupid just standing there without smoking too. Sucks but oh well.

Trying to stop using tobacco. 6-7 days in.

First of all, I'm not a smoker, but I use another form for tobacco called snus. But trying to quit both of those things is the same. So I guess I could call for some help here.

I've been using tobacco since I was 15 or 16. I have been using it for 3-4 years and tried to quit several times during this period. Now I decided to try again and I'm nearly a week in. I've heard the worst days are are the first ones. But for me, it's only been getting worse and worse. I'm just so tempted to drive to a shop and just buy some. It's really bad. Each night since I stopped taking tobacco I have been dreaming about tobacco. And in each dream I take a snus. I need some advice pretty soon or I'm not going to make it. I'm training, laying off coffee and several other things, but it doesn't help at all. 

The problem for me is that I find excuses to why I should not quit with snus. And I kinda feel like I'm missing something when I'm not using it because snus just feels so damn good. It's not the same watching a film or playing a game without snus. Or a social situation with friends. I don't get the same feeling of relaxation, happiness etc. You know what I mean. So when I get in one of those situations, I can't help thinking that if I had snus I would have a better time overall. So that's my problem. That's what I keep saying to myself and it's kinda true isn't it?

Please help

Also, sorry for bad spelling and all that. Can't really focus without snus.

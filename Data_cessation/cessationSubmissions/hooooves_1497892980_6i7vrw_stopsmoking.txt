Quitting side effects question.....

So I dropped the cigs about 12 days ago and purchased a Bo E-cig from my local vape shop. Before this I was a pack per day for about 20 years. About 6 days into this transition I developed gum and tooth pain along with a couple canker sores. I've read that this is a side effect of quitting cigs but have any of you experienced something similar? If so, how long did symptoms persist? Thanks in advance for any input.

I can't walk a straight line but I can breathe!

It's an absolutely beautiful day here in MO. High's close to the 70s before it gets cold again. I got done with work and decided to do my workout outdoors. I put on my headphones, turn on my podcast (Benedict Cumberbatch on the Nerdist. Highly recommend), and start my workout. After 10 minutes of walking and finishing my jog up a large hill, I realized one very wonderful thing: I could breathe. Any shortness of breath I had was normal for the activity. I wasn't out of breath as I usually am. I was so excited, I didn't pay attention to where I was going, missed my step, and twisted my ankle and back by landing in a hole. But I could breathe better than I have in years and that almost brought tears to my eyes. 

I always joke I was a runner on hiatus. But now, I know I'm a runner in training again. I'm going to be able to do the 10K for my birthday. I could breathe and that felt amazing. 

It feels like, in the beginning, that we are losing so much when we quit. Some of us, I know I did, grieve. We feel so many emotions connected with loss. But oh man, that moment when you realize how much you've gained? Nothing compares to that. 

I found My Quit again today :)

I have a cold.

*This* is what a cold is like for non-smokers? This is NOTHING. This is a mild throat irritation that's already starting to leave after 3 days. The gallons of phlegm, horrible soreness in my throat that was only exacerbated by the cigarettes that I still choked down even while my body was screaming at me to stop, the requisite next 2-3 weeks of SLOWLY recovering and blowing my nose, now *that* was a cold. This is mildly irritating at worst, and really just an excuse to binge watch Jessica Jones for couple days in the middle of the week and eat tasty soups. If you are getting ready to quit or are just getting started, just wait until you get sick. It's awesome.

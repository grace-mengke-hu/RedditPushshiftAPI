[Club 31]Counting down 31 days smoke free

Below is everyone who signed up for the first wave. Let me know if I missed anyone. 

If you quit smoking before or on December 1 and you still want to join, just say the word below. 

How it works:

* Stay smoke-free for each of the 31 days in December. Get through the holidays. Get a month under your belt before 2015. (You may already have more days behind you. Great.)
* There will be a check-in once a week. Those who report that they are still smoke-free will stay on the list for the following week.
* Make a point of posting in this sub and commenting, to help people struggling. Stay positive. If your post is related in anyway to [Club 31], include that tag in your title.
* There will be a chance to join second and third waves later on. But you know you want the cred of being free the whole month.

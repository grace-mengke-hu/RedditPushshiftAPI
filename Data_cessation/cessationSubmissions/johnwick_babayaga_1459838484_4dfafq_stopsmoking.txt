Afraid of Cancer. Tried Quitting many times. Just wanted to share

I started smoking at the age of 19 due to exam stress a friend suggested me to smoke and I smoked two cigs and I felt dizzy. Now I am 26 and still smoking. I smoke on an average 7-8 cigs a day and the count increases on any special ocassion or weekends. I have tried to quit many times...at most I can go smoke free for one month. I quit daily in morning and start again in evening. I have read all the information on nicotine addiction and read Allen Carrs book two times. I cant tell my parents about it. I am from India and I couldnt get my hands on any nicotine patches. Although I could get nicotex or nicorette chewing gum. But my smoker friends told me they are not that useful.

**From last 3-4 days I am feeling a tight nerve in my throat, I dont know if it is due to minor cold or something else** I am afraid of getting cancer. I am well educated but sstill indulge in this bad habit. I think my addiction is more mental than physical. Dont know what to do? Just wanted to share this.

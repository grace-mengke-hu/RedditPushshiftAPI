Haven't smoked for a week this is how I feel...

I'm less anxious at work and the day goes by faster. I've been sleeping nicer and have been dreaming, which I haven't done since I can remember. My breathing is better and I feel more at peace with everything. Hope I can make it a month. Good luck y'all!

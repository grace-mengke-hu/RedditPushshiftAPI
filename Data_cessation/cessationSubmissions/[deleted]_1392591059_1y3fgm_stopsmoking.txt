After 3 weeks I smoked one

It was okay, I guess. After a few hours I started feeling sick-ish. The disgusting taste was stuck in my mouth and the smell on my jacket. It reminded me of a few of the reasons why I decided to quit in the first place. I don't think that cig will get me hooked again.. I think it would keep me going instead. 

Just wanted to share for anyone else who cracked. You shouldn't feel guilty even if you enjoyed it. Just try to remember all those reasons why you tried quitting in the first place and that relapse will disgust you and remind you to keep away from those nasty cancer sticks.

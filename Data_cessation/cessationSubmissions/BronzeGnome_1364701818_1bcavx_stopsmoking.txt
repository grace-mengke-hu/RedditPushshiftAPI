First week down...

This week was my uni's spring break, so I took the opportunity to quit smoking. It's been over 8 days, and I was feeling great. The withdrawals were pretty much over with by day 4, and I've read most of the easy way book this week. But today, I've had some pretty bad withdrawals that've put me in a shitty mood. Didn't give in, but tomorrow I'm going back to my house I'm renting at uni. I live there with 4 chain smokers. What are some tips to not give in?

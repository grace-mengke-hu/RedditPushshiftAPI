My sense of smell is back!

I never noticed just how much my sense of smell was affected by smoking. After a week of quitting, today it felt like my nose was reintroduced to the world. I work retail and I was smelling all sorts of things from customers that it was actually a little overwhelming. Canâ€™t believe I chose to live a different way for years.

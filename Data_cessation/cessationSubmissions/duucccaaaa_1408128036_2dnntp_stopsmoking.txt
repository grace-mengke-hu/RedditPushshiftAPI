Some of my friends are not happy about me quitting smoking

I noticed that some of my friends who are smokers would be happy to see me fail and start smoking again. It was kind of surprise for me because I expected, if nothing else, little bit of support and in some cases it was completely opposite. Did anyone else have the same problem and why do you think that is? When I was smoking if somebody told me that thay quit, eather I didn't care or it was motivation for me when I decided to quit.

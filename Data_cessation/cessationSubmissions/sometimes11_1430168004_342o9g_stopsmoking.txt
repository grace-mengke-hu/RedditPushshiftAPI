trying again

hi all,

after some time, i am getting back on the no-smoke train. haven't smoked today, so we're off to a good start.

i find that my cravings usually strike the hardest after some kind of social interaction. being a cloistered academic, most interactions with people give me that "jumpy" feeling that screams: run outside and have a smoke! 

i think what i've realized is that it's a crutch for a kind of insecurity. it gives you something to "do," and makes you look like you're "doing" something. plus you can rely on it to be there "with" you as you're conversing with another person, and provides the right amount of time to stop short a conversation.

so, the first key to any kind of recovery is acknowledgement of one's motivations and limitations. my limitations are none. i can do anything i want. i am atop of the world.

but seriously. i smoked for 10 years, started at 18, i'm now 28, and some change, so over 10 years. i never thought i would smoke this long, but here i am. when i hit 28, i thought, this has got to stop. i did stop but slipped up along the way. 

this may not be the right area to ask for health advice, but i want to make sure i am healthy. what can i ask the doctor to do for me? i've also been having random heart flutters more often recently--the first one i ever had was back in 2010 or so, but now they are a couple of times a day. i think it's time to hit the doctor as well.

anyway, glad to be here. looking forward to staying off of the nasty stuff.

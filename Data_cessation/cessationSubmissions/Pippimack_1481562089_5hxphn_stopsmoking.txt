Almost at 100 days.

I was almost a pack a day smoker for years - I have used this forum to give up so many times but I usually get to about 60 days and then start again... I usually start again because of some trigger like a big party or blow-out. I can't believe I've made it to 99 days. Tomorrow I'll be triple figures for the first time since I was about 13.

I actually had a couple of cigarettes about 70 days through on a night out but I knew it just wasn't the same. I don't know why but usually, that would have been me started again. This time it was different... I think. I sort of enjoyed them, but not in the same way...

I would normally have reset my badge... in fact I normally would have just started smoking again back to a pack a day. This time... I just don't want to.

It feels like a strange epiphany. I don't want to be complacent but I really think this time I've cracked it.

Your thoughts?

I don't even know how much money I've saved (but it's a lot) or how many cigarettes it is that I haven't smoked - these things are just not important anymore! It's not a special day, just the day I remembered to check my status. I hope that all of you get to experience this feeling and freedom one day, every day - hang in there, this is an awesome feeling :)

Mustering up the resolve to quit. Day 2 of an involuntary break from smoking

I'm half writing this for self therapy and half for advice so please read if you can and give your thoughts.

I last smoked yesterday morning. I didn't quit out of choice, I just can't afford to buy more until tomorrow. So whether I like it or not, I am about to go 48 hours without smoking, for the first time in about 5 months.

The last time I quit was in September 2016, and I lasted until December. I caved in WAY too easily and arrogantly ("One pack won't hurt durr!"). 

I know from that short period of abstinence that life is better without it. No stink, no disgustingness, no wheazy breath, no sense of shame. All round betterness. If only I can hack the cravings.

If I don't smoke tomorrow then that'll be 3 days. I know that when I can get to a week I tend to rise above it all together. If I don't buy tomorrow I can be almost half way to effectively beating it.

Do I want to beat smoking? It's so powerful, and I keep caving in and buying more.

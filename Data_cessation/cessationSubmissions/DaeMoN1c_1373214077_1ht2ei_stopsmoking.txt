Any advice for someone trying to stop smoking?

After having pneumonia a while back and just after being diagnosed with sleep apnea all the signs are pointing to the fact that I should stop smoking (losing some weight wouldn't hurt either). The problem is I don't particularly want to. 
  
I used to have terrible anger problems and found that smoking itself calmed me down as well as being a useful tool for escaping situations that caused me to be angry or uncomfortable. For that reason alone I'm a bit wary of stopping smoking. Apart from that it's now quite deep seeded as I smoke while I play games (between games of Dota/League of Legends for example) and when I'm out socialising, generally whilst drinking. 
  
The only time I have tried to stop smoking in the past I quit completely from day 1 and honestly, after the first 3-4 days I found that the cravings had almost completely gone and I no longer felt like I NEEDED to smoke but the real problem for me was that I wanted to which lead to me making the decision that I just didn't want to give up smoking.
  
But now, as I've said, for health reasons I feel it would be best for me to stop. What advice can you gentleman/ladies give me to make a better attempt at it this time? 
  
I'm also more than happy to answer any questions that would lead to better feed back from you find people of /r/stopsmoking.

Quitting When Surrounded by Other Smokers. Any Advice?

So the laws in my state are changing to age 21 to purchase nicotine products. Figured I might as well really attempt to quit now. I picked up one of those stupid Juuling habits in college last year, but it’s gotten ridiculously expensive and I’m already feeling some negative side-effects. I’ve tried to quit off and on to no avail. Problem is, my whole family smokes. When I’ve tried quitting the Juul, I’d eventually cave in after a stressful day at work and ask my mom for a cigarette. Any advice on kicking an addiction when you’re just surrounded with other smokers? Thanks

Also, it’s not even the nicotine itself that’s truly addicting to me. It’s the actual motion of it all. I’m so used to constantly hitting it. Any good tricks to simulate that habit?

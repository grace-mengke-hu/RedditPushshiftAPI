1 week - don't crave it anymore but going crazy with some "symptoms", is this normal?

Ok for the first 3 days it was hard. I stopped to take a "smoking break" but then I'd tell myself "nope". So that was the hardest part but I was feeling fine (physically). Felt healthier, in good mood. Just the cravings. After day 4... headaches, grumpy, I feel really angry and anxious. I don't even crave smoking any more. That part of the "habit" and going for it is completely gone (which amazes me) but I'm trying to relax and I feel so tired. My sleep has been awful, nightmares and all. Is this normal? Or is it from my own issues with anxiety? I just really want to know if this will pass and if it's common when you quit even if you don't have anxiety issues at all.

I've quit before for quite some time but I don't remember feeling this aggravated! My nails are almost bleeding and I stopped doing that months ago as well :/ Ugh! Stay strong everyone! The cravings for me were easier to deal with than all of these physical symptoms I'm having (but not sure it's just from quitting).

Any advice or explanation appreciated - thank you so much to all of you! &lt;3

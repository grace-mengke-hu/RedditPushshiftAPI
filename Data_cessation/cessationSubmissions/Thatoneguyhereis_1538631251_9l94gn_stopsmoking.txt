5 weeks no smoking!

I have made it almost 5 weeks so far and today pretty proud of myself. My roommate had a pack cigs laying out on the table. The desire to just grab one cig out of that pack and go out on the balcony and smoke it was very tempting but I decided no I quit now and not going to steal from my roommate. So Iâ€™m pretty happy with myself I was able to resist the urge.

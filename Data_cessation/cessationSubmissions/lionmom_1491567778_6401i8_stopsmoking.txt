100 Hours Smoke-Free Thanks To This Sub

I've tried to quit... a hundred times before this but on the second day, I'd always cave. 

I found this sub on the second day when I was 100% sure I was going to go buy smokes :) after reading the posts and comments, I didn't! 

Thank you to everyone here who cares and encourages each other! You rock!

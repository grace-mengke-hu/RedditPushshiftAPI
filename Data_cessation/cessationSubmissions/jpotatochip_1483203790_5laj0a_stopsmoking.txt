Tonight at midnight!

I'm here to say I'm quitting smoking after 6 years. It's my New Years resolution, my start to a healthy life, the start of my family as I just got married. But I want to post here for anybody that's with me. Here to help others or ask for help from others. Reply with your reasons, reply with the hurdles ur jumping, reply with the tough days as I'm sure there will be many. But let's stick together on the endeavor and make 2017 the year you become healthy, but most importantly the year you started looking out for you!

I will help my father.

My family respects each other's privacy and personal matters. We tend not to interfere if unnecessary. My father's been a chain smoker for 30 years. What the fuck have I been doing. How did I just ignore that fact even though I heard his dreadful coughing every day? 

I don't speak much with him, but I know that simply pleading won't move him. I'll first have to a research on cigarettes. Everything, including its history, early uses, effects, marketing, ingredients, culture, withdrawal effects, treatments, tips. I'll read the shit out of this subreddit. 

How should I present my research to him.. A written report? A presentation? A booklet? A letter? Under the guise of a school report? Will that offend him?

Should I or should I not include my bias towards the subject? Should I be selective about what information to include? I'll have to do my best to not appear reproachful. He's sensitive about that. 

I read some comments about how Alan Carr's book works well. I will read that too. 

How the heck will I convince him to get a medical check up and get into the habit of regular exercise. I'm not in the position to preach about that.

I don't know what to do. I'll have to be very knowledgeable about everything or else he'll find a way to start an argument. I won't inform him. I'll share with him. Oh shit he just coughed again. He get's up 4 in the morning to smoke. He can't even stay in venues too long. He used to be so good at tennis. What am I doing I should start right now.

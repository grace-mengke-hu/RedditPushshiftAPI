I think I'm ready to quit...Maybe?

Wow. My hands shook just typing that. At this point I get nervous just thinking about being without cigarettes. At the same time I hate spending money on it and I hate smelling like it. I hate that it takes away money that we (my family and I) could really use. My husband wants to quit as well and is going cold turkey starting yesterday. A bit of back story there...we live in a non smoking apartment and I caught him smoking in it and hiding it from me. 3 times. I'm the only income so I stopped buying him cigarettes yesterday. A bitch move I know but the other option is that if we're caught, we could lose our apartment. So he's already pretty cheery with me you can imagine. How do we go about quitting together, cold turkey and not slitting each others throats? My will power is shit. I'll admit that. I've been holding us both back for a long time and I know that. 

I'm at a loss. And anxious. :/

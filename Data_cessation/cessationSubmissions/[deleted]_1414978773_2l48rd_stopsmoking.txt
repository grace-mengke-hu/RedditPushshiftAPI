Just had my last.

I've smoked since I was about 17 and quit for a year around 21 and now I'm 22 and have recently been smoking, don't know why. I'd go out in my car, park up, watch the traffic and smoke. Why did I start again? I've had enough, I can spend my time better than sitting there harming myself. Tomorrow will be day one and there won't be another.

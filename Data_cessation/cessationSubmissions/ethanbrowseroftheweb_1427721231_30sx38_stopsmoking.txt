I'm finally fed up with it, today's the day I start.

I'm finally ready to give up the old, trusty, vice that is Cigarettes. I felt that it would all be a bit easier with a place to vent, so I hopped on reddit and landed here.  So here we go..
  First of all, I live in Indiana, and what sparked this specific urge to quit was the weather. With Indiana weather being the way that it is, it's been cold off and on, making my allergies go off the charts, and my immune system crumble apart to nothing. I'm 20 years old and have been an avid smoker since I was 14. I can remember my mom finding a rubber band stuffed with about 12 cigarettes that my friend and I took from random packs of his parents. 
  I've tried quitting cold turkey multiple times, but have always caved in while watching others smoke, or going out with the smokers when they do go smoke. But this time I'm going in with a new attitude, especially after finding this subreddit. I know when my biggest triggers are, but coping with them hasn't ever really been too big of a problem. After my morning coffee, first and lunch break at work, or while with friends to pass the time. 
  I was wondering, are these BIG triggers for every smoker, or are everyone's triggers a little more specific to themselves? 
  After checking out this sub and reading multiple suggestions of Allen Carrs book, I think I'll give it a read if I seem to struggle throughout these first few days. 
Any tips or solid motivation from others who are in the process and/or have succeeded in going cold turkey?

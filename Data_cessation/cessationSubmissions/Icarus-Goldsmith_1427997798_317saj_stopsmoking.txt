Hopeful but doubtful

Today is the day that I have quit smoking. This day has been coming for a while but this is it! No more cigarettes for this 23 year old! I’m very positive about it, I know it’s a huge lifestyle change but the myriad of benefits to my personal life and health hugely outweigh what small joy a cigarette will give me. I have tried quitting before (many times) to no avail. But this time I have a plan…

I am a university student who lives away from home, I smoke on average between 10 and 15 cigarettes a day. The reason I have chosen today as my quitting date is because I have come home for the Easter break for 2 weeks and I feel that the change in scenery (and also being away from my triggers at my uni house) will be a huge benefit, and get me off on the right foot.

My concern is my actual triggers. At university I live with another guy who smokes tobacco and pot almost religiously, (rolls joints with tobacco, yet claims he’s “quit smoking”). We both smoke indoors, and it is a very tiny house. My major worry is that I will (hopefully) have not smoked for 2 weeks, but I almost know I will give in to smoking again as soon as I step into that environment. I have a very addictive personality and find it hard to control cravings in some situations. 

I would like some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation to this. If there are any success stories which will motivate me or any methods I could try to control my cravings it would be much appreciated and will go a long way to help me finally quit for good!

P.S I know I will need to have a chat to my housemate to ask him to smoke outside from now on, seeing as there is not so much point in quitting if second hand smoke lingers around. 

TL;DL – Trying to quit smoking, live with someone who smokes a lot with no intention of quitting, how do I control my cravings?

Getting close to 6 months on my quit. Emotional cravings really suck.

I know physically the addiction is gone but emotionally is a different story. I usually come here when the craving hits, I read, interact and before I know it, the feeling is gone. It's been a bit more tough these last few times. Not really even sure how to describe it. I can say that between 5-7 pm is the time it usually hits me. I'm not giving in, just needed to vent a little...guess I'm just feeling sorry for myself right now. Tired of always being the "strong one!"  Anyway, my advice to you in this situation would be to hang in there. It will get better. So guess I'll just go to bed and repeat that to myself. Tomorrow is a new day, I'm off and I'm going to enjoy the crisp morning air with a steaming cup of hot coffee on the front porch. Later....

friends need serious help

I quit smoking and its been 22days i was doing good...But when i drink i temp to smoke and I smoked Not the first time It was two times in this 22days ... 
Yesterday had few beers and carving for cigg was so high and I eventually  lit up a cigg one after the other with a count of four...felt very bad and want to punch myself the day after .

Normal times i won't have carvings to smoke but at drinking it makes me so weak.

Please want to get over smoking while drinking please help...

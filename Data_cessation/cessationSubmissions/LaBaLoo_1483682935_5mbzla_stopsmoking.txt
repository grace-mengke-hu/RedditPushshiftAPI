In a few hours, I will have ONE WEEK of NO cigarettes!

One week!  Seven days!  I'm feeling so happy with this small success!  I'm still doing what a lot of people have suggested:  just don't smoke today.  Don't smoke right now.  Nonsmokers do not smoke.  I have become a nonsmoker!  I read and post a lot in this sub and was a lurker for many months before I committed.  I am very grateful to everyone here and thank you for the endless support and inspiration!  Stay strong and don't smoke no matter what!!!

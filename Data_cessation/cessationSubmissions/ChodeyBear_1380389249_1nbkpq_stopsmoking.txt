Any tips about when to take a step down with the patch?

So I'm on 3 weeks today and man I feel good :) I'm using Nicorette invisi-patches and started on the 15mg ones as whilst I was smoking 15-20 a day they were super light. 

According to proper instructions I think you're supposed to stick it out for like 8 weeks before starting to reduce the patches? I know at 3 weeks I'm still in the danger zone, but my cravings have really settled to 1 or 2 a day, and rather than being cravings they're more of just a passing thought. I've also made major breakthroughs like not giving in when I've argued with my boyfriend - previously that's usually been the death of the quit attempt!! 

I am reading the Allen Carr book so yes I'm aware I'm still feeding the addiction whilst I'm using patches lol. So I don't want a lecture :) but this is part of what's making me want to get on with cutting them down - the sooner I'm completely rid of it the better. Also the book is helping my motivation - it does a very good job of making you feel stupid for ever having smoked! With my motivation as strong as it is surely reducing my patches is possible? 

I guess I just want some advice from others who've tried reducing their patches at different stages, to see whether it's a good idea or whether its just going to be a big risk. 

Thanks in advance!!!

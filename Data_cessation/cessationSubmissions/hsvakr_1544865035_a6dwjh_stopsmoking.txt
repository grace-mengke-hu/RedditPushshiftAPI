Gross question about bodily functions after quitting smoking

So I quit five days ago and I CANNOT stop farting, seriously each day cigarette free is like another day with 10x the farts more than the day prior. When will this stop it’s kinda nasty and I know it has nothing to do with “eating more” or “eating healthier” because I’m dieting and actually eating less and eating healthy so what gives?

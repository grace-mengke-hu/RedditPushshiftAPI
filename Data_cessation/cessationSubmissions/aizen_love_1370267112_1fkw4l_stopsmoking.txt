I'm still having a really rough time. Help?

I chew gum like crazy. I have a camelbak which has helped the oral fixation. I've been knitting and crocheting to help. It's all worked a bit but I'm still going crazy. I want cigarettes all the time. I know there's no nicotine left in me. I just don't know how to continue with this. Please help!

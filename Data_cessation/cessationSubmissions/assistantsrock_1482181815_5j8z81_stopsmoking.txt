Stupid Furnace

So 16 days in and doing well but then husband texts that something is wrong with the furnace and it isn't working.  And it is -5 here today!  First time I think since I quit that I have felt stressed and all I want to relieve that stress is a cigarette.  Not another puff no matter what and thanks to whoever reads this and can sympathize.  😝

Quit drinking over a year ago, smoking is next!

I finally managed to stop drinking a little over 16 months ago, after trying for a couple of years.  I've recently decided that it's time to stop smoking too.

I've been reading the Easy Way and lurking on this sub (both at the advice of my AA sponsor), and it's really making it clear what a joke it is for me to be afraid of quitting after I've dealt with something as serious as alcohol withdrawal.  Another thing the book has helped me realize is that unlike alcohol, smoking isn't a crutch to deal with underlying emotional problems.  It's just something I do because I've been programmed to do that.

Anyway, I'm almost done with the book, and I think my current pack is going to be my last (my mind tenses up just thinking about that, but fuck that noise!).  Many thanks to everyone on this sub, one tool that getting sober and stopping smoking have in common is the power of community, and this sub has it in spades!

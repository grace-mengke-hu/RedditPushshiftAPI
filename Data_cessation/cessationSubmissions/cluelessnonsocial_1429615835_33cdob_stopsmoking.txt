Smoker for 7 years, 1-2 packs a day. I quit 3 weeks back. I have some questions.

I was a heavy smoker for 7 years, smoking 1-2 packs a day. I quit 3 weeks ago, and I have started jogging/walking in mornings. I don't experience cravings anymore. I was going through this subreddit and it raised some doubts in my mind.

Q1. I have not experienced any coughing or hacking whatsoever after quitting. Is this normal or is it too early for this. When does it normally starts. 

Q2. This is regarding my jogging and running. I try to cover 5-6 Km every day, in that 1.5 km is of continuous jogging rest in walking. I was very active in sports before starting smoking but stopped after i got the habit. This is the first time i am doing any physical activity after getting the habit. I experience mild pain in chest while jogging. Is this normal. When will it go way. Is it fine If i increase my jogging stretch gradually.

Thanks in advance. Any comments are highly appreciated.

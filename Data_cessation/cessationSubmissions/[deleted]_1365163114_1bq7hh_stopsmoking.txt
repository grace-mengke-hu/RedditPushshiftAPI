So I'm quiting tomorrow...

Any advice? I'm going to start the day that I go away for holiday that way I (hope I) will be less tempted to smoke.

I'm planning on exercising a lot when I am away as I have heard that will help, that and the fact that i'm out of shape compared to this time last year. I also have an E-cig but i'm not sure if I should use it or not, what is your opinions on it?

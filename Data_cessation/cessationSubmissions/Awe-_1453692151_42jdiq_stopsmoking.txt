What was/is your best quit mantra? Day 1, again, need inspiration.

Day 6 seems to be some sort of wall for me.  Staring a quit, over again.  Damn, so lame.  Had so much encouragement here. 
 I see you with the year celebrations and I ....  oh me, oh my ...I want what you have: freedom from this nasty killer trap. 
 Made it though today.  
 Any mantras that helped you?

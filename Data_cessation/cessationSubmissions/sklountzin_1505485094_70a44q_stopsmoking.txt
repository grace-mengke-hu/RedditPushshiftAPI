Feeling determined

So I quit for like 8 months last year. It was awesome, the positive changes were endless. Then I thought I was in control and had a few cigs one stupid drunk weekend. Now I've been smoking pretty much at my pre quit rate for the past 5 months and I've had enough. It's only been 10 hours since my last drag but I feel unusually determined to quit. Kinda the way I felt when I quit last year. Anyway just wanted to post on here to try and keep myself accountable.

We make Dentist very happy!

Just had my first appointment as a non-smoker at the dentist.
She was truly please that i had quit and encouraged me to keep on going, She is very much looking forward to my next check up on 17th oct. I should have purley white teeth by then.
P.s I just want to thank everyone on this sub reddit for helping me get this far. Keep it up guys, you are doing amazing things!!!

Need a little push

Hey fellow brave addiction fighters

I am in a very low motivation period. I had stop for like 9 or 10 months, with a very strict discipline, and sun is back, I am hanging out more, and mostly I realized I made half my social life around cigarettes (been smoking for 10 years, and smoked a lot). So when I stopped i felt very anxious because I had a very hard time socializing (I am very introverted, cigarettes are a good excuse to start a conversation...)

I felt a bit lonely, had lot of pressure with uni, and I started smoking again with my all smokers friends, and I bought a packet again, and now things got worse because I am falling in a very wrong circle where I'm convinced since I managed to stop for 10 months earlier (which was something absolutely impossible to me years back) i can stop whenever I want, but I still smoke at least twice a day, and i follow the same pattern i had before stopping (like bored? Cigarette) I don't know how to handle this, and I am afraid I don't want to stop anymore because it did hurt my social life and I had a hard time adapting myself to this... 

Anyone felt the same about their social life? Any advice to get a good rebound?

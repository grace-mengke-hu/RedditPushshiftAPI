One week and getting harder

Today marks the 7th day I've been smoke free, 5th day with no nicotine since I was using the patch the first 2 days.  On day 2, I was fired from my job and have managed to not light up.  Each day has been getting progressively more difficult instead of easier, and today I found myself with a cigarette in my mouth while I applied for unemployment.  I think the fact that this is the longest I've ever gone and that my post-quit cough is almost gone is what's keeping me from lighting it.

How long did it take for quitting to be easier for you?

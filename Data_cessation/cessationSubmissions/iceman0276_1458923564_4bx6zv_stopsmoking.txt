Here I go. 32 hours in, and I'm doing pretty good. Thanks for the support!!!

I've been lurking here, reading your stories. I have to say that it's been inspiring. What an age we live in where we can hear stories in real time all around the world. Anyway, I've decided to juice a ton this time and I'm going to try to stay away from alcohol. It's day two and I remember day two being kind of easy. I think my challenge will be tomorrow and the next day. I can do this!!!!

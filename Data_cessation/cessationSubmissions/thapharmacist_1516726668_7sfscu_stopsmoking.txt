Never thought I would make it 1 year today! Stay strong because eventually you forget you ever even smoked!

I made it one year today and never in a million years thought I would. I smoked a pack or more every day for almost 20 years and was the friend who loved smoking. No one ever thought I would quit and neither did I, I just thought I would try and see how long I could go. I am so stubborn I just never gave in. I now don't even think about smoking and forget at times that I ever even smoked. It is so weird looking back at the first month and how crazy I was thinking about it 24/7 and checking the smoke free app constantly, to now I don't even notice. You guys can do it if you want it! Just stay strong each day gets easier just remember that!

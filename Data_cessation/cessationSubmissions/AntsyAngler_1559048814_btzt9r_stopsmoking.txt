One Year of No Smoking (and 1000 days of not drinking)

Quitting smoking has been the hardest thing for me. I'm very happy to have hit this one year milestone. It gets easier with every month that goes by. I don't think I could have kept up my convictions to stay away from nicotine if I was drinking. I'm feeling healthier and happy to avoid wasting so much money on smokes.

Keep it up! It's worth it.

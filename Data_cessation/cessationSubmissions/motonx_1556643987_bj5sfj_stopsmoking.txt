This is going to be my last day 1 in my life

I’ve failed quit smoking heaps of times. The longest I’ve been was only a month and half. 
Life is not that easy, and bad and sad things happen outside of my control. I started smoking again because of the stress. I need to put my shit together. 
This is something I can control if I put my mind to it. I’ve got to do this.
Let’s not have another day 1 forever.

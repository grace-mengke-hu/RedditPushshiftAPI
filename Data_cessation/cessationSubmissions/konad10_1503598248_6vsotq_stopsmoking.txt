So..Let's go

Hello everybody
I'm 36, been smoking for more than 20 years..
Thought about quitting many times, always relapsed
Past 6 months I have reduced it to less than 10 cigarettes a day, and last 3 to less than 5
Today I finished Allan Carter's book, I smoked my last one and I 'm ready to go!!
Wish me luck!!

How to deal with the fatigue after quitting?

I finally managed to go 3 weeks without smoking cigarettes (thank god for vaping though, going to ween of that too soon).

My biggest problem: I can't go full days without feeling tired all the time. My blood circulation heavily seems to rely on smoking. When I tried to go 1 day without one, I didn't even fully wake up because my heart wasn't used to pumping through dilated vessels or some shit.

I tried to do some sports but I don't really have a drive and constantly feel tired. Caffeine only helps so much and once the effect of it goes away it even feels worse.

What can I do to finally feel actually better?

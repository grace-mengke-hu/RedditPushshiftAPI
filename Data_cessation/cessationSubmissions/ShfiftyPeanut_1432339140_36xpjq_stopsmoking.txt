Struggling

I posted here about 2 weeks ago, that I was quitting, since then, I've had a couple days where the cravings have gotten the better of me and I've had 2-3 smokes in a row. Some days I have 1, Some days I might have 2, others I can have none.

I've just purchased myself http://imgur.com/CMnD4t5

I didn't believe this shit would work in the past, and thought it would be easy... it's not easy, but don't be afraid to get help in the form of Nicorette patches/gum/spray's... they work. First time I used mine... it blew me away. It actually worked! This has given me renewed strength to get off the smokes. If you can get yourself down to the odd smoke here and there in your day like I did, get something fast acting. It actually works! I am over the moon.

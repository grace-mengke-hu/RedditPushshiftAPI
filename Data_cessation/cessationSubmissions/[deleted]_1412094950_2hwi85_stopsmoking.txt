My negative experience with bupropion (zyban or wellbutrin)

I noticed not many people have posted on this, so I just wanted to share my experience in case anyone is thinking of using bupropion to quit. All of this is merely how it worked for me, as I have seen it work very differently for other people.

**The upside**: I was very very scared of quitting and I was convinced I couldn't do it on my own. If I'm honest with myself, knowing I'd be taking a drug gave me the courage to quit my drug of choice: nicotine.

It actually does reduce the strength and the duration of cravings very effectively.

**The downside**: Bupropion drove me crazy. It gave me such horrible mood swings that I think it made the whole thing harder rather than easier. I never got to the right dose, and tampering with dosage only made things worse, since every adjustment meant new side effects and more violent emotional backlashes. This is obviously not good in terms of smoking cessation, since violent emotions will make you want to smoke, although as I said the drug was very efficient in terms of making cravings more endurable.

It was hard knowing which physical symptoms had to do with smoking cessation and which ones had to do with this new substance in my body.

After two to three weeks of trying to adjust, I abruptly stopped taking it because it was too much and because I had been reading on nicotine addiction, and re-evaluating my fears of quitting. However, this meant going through a period of adjusting to the lack of buproprion in my system. By then I had only been nicotine free for something like 5 days. And quitting antidepressants just like that is not a good idea, let alone pairing that with quitting cigarettes.

**My conclusion**: I should have gone cold-turkey from the start. However, as you can see from this story, I was not able to take the treatment properly and maybe I didn't give it time to work as it should. 

I saw my dad quit his 40-a-day habit with bupropion for 5 years and he didn't have such steep side effects at all.

**TL;DR**: Wellbutrin gave me horrible side effects which I think made things harder rather than easier. My advice is to try cold-turkey first.

I’m vaping and I feel like I’m cheating

I’m 29 and smoked for 13 years. On November 27, I smoked my last cigarette and have been vaping instead. In that time, I’ve dropped down to a 6mg nicotine level. While I’m glad I don’t smoke anymore, and while I’m only using vaping as a means to an end, I feel like I’m kind of an imposter. Did anyone else feel like this?

Also, I know a lot of people talk about coughing junk up after they quit, but I haven’t gotten there yet. I did smoke 8 cigarettes over the course of the day about 3 days ago and I’m hoping I haven’t completely erased my progress. I have had a bit of a cough today so I’m wondering if it’s because of those cigarettes or if I’m starting to purge my lung junk.

Cravings cravings cravings

Damn I want a cigarette. This morning I was trying to cook breakfast and I don't know why I just snapped and got so stressed out. I was just thinking just one damn cigarette would be fine. But then I started thinking about badge. And I'm not going out like that. But this craving hit me hard today. What do you guys do when a craving strikes? My girls needs "space" right now too so that's making me stress out more.

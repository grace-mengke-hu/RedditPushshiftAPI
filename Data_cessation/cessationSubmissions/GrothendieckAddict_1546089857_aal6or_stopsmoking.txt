Am I the only one having problems breathing?

Hey guys,

I'vr been smoke free for 5 days and 21 hours. Usually after 4 days your breathing gets so much better. But what I feel is the kind of breathing you have whenever you feel anxious, yet at the same time I don't feel anxious. It's kind of pretty weird, and I had troubles falling asleep yesterday. Does anyone felt the same thing while quitting? How long did it subsist?

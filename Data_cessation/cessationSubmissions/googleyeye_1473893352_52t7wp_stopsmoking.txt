I can't believe it has been over a month

I actually lost track of time until someone asked me. It will be one month and one week, 35 days, tomorrow. I still get cravings but I have managed to overcome them. My roomie offered me a cigarette, as did a friend, this week and both times I turned them down. I have also noticed that when I am riding my bike or hiking, my legs get tired before I get out of breath, which is new for me. 

This time quitting is for good. This time I got serious about it.

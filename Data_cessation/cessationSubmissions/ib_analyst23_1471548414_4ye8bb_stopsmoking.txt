Have you ever attempted to quit smoking by simply not carrying any credit cards/cash/other monetary items for a few days?

I was thinking of trying to get through the first few days of quitting by not taking any cash, credit cards, or other payment methods, so that even if i want to buy a pack, that I have no ability to do so. 

Has anyone ever tried this?

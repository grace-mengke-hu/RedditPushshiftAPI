Breathing problems, rant/vent

I know this just means my lungs are healing.  I've read all about the little hairlike things in my lungs that are trying desperately to work and clean all the gunk out of there.  

But damn, I wish my lungs would heal a little more quietly!

I can't get a deep breath without coughing.

I wake up every morning when my body decides I'm no longer allowed to lie down without coughing.

I can't take a hot shower anymore.

I'm really looking forward to this being over.

Thanks for listening.

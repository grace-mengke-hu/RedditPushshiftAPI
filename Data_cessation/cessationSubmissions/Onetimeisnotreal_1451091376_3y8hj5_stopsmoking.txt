One time!? Its never that simple.

I quit 11 months ago and this Christmas was visiting my old friend to spend time with. My mother was hospitalized 4months ago, because of illness so family holidays was kinda gone, (that prob triggered me). We drank some wine, a lot of it actually and he offered some "one time" smoke for good old times. Obviously i was not able to decline...

I know i am being selfish, but please /r/stopsmoking say something to help me to understand i wont come back to it. I felt so happy to quit, to be honest. I dont want to go back, and this subreddit helped me big time to quit in the first place. 

Worst thing, I already imagine myself going to the shop tomorrow and buying a pack of cigs.


Sorry for my English btw, I havent used it in a long time.

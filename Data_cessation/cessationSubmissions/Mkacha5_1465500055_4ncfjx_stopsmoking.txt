Almost ruined everything.

Yesterday was one of the hardest days in a while. At night, I got a cigarette from my friend, lit it, and took the first puff. It was so bad, it tasted awful and burned my throat. I threw it away after the second puff. I still feel guilty and angry at myself. I almost ruined so much work.

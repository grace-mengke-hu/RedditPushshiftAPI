One month yesterday

I've been cigarette free for two years, but I vaped heavier than when I smoked at 1.8% nicotine.

I reduced down zero nicotine gradually, and then quit cold turkey last month after 5 years of smoking (20 y/o)

Still getting cravings, not constant anymore though. 

Does anyone else find themselves trying to reason themselves into just one more cigarette? I'll catch myself doing it constantly, but I really don't want another one and I'm not sure why I keep trying to reason myself into one.

Chantix (part 2)

Okay guys, so I posted the other day about y'all's opinions on Chantix. Here's the verdict: I absolutely cannot take Chantix. I became severely depressed and anxious. It came to a head on Monday night when, out of nowhere I started crying. I went to the bathroom to clean up and had the worst panic attack of my life. I sat in the bathroom bawling my eyes out, unable to breathe, nose even started bleeding. This was all completely out of left field. 

Needless to say I took myself off of the Chantix (threw the rest of them away in a random blind rage). I was in a fog all day yesterday, on edge. I'm feeling better today, but am going to my NP to let her know what happened.

Please note for those who are considering Chantix: I am not trying to put down Chantix or scare anyone away from it. I just wanted to share my personal experience so you will see the ugly of it. Looking on here there are plenty of success stories with Chantix. Just be careful if you do take it.

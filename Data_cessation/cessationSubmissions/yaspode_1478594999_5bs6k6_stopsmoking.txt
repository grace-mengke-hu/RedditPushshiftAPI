50 days - encouragement and thanks

After 50 days I finally believe I can be a non-smoker.

I passed most of ther trigger situation tests and the best thing: today I went into my favorit cafe and drank a big coffee. And *not once* did I think about smoking. Can't believe it. During the first week I was sitting at my desk with cravings, a clenched jaw and constantly  wiping my lips like Jack Torrance from the Shining. People told me, I looked really crazy and I felt crazy. But it passed and now looking at smokers doesn't trigger me at all as doesn't coffee, parties, alkohol, meals and social gatherings. Stress is still a trigger but this will pass as everything else did. 

So I want to tell all of you first week quitters out there: It gets better, really better and you start forgetting and you start feeling free. And a big thank you to all the people here for sharing your stories. It helped me so much.

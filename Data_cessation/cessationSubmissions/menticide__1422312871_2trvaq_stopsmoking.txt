Nearing the 3 months quit mark...

I'm starting to struggle with it, I always seem to slip up around the 3 month mark. I find myself intensely watching people smoking cigarettes. Craving the feeling of smoking a tailored cigarette (which is odd because I smoked rolling tobacco). It's really starting to stress me out. 

I don't hang around anybody who smokes anymore, and I rarely go out so I'm not likely to go out and buy cigarettes... But I am getting rather worried. I don't want to slip up! The cravings are sometimes VERY hard to ignore.

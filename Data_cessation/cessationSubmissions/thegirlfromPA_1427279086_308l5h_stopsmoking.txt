Why is this so hard all of a sudden?

22 and a half days in and the last couple days have been hell. So much harder than the first 2 weeks. I am resisting but my mind keeps up with the tricks. The "it's ok to smoke once in a while, just casually, just in the car, just a few a day" type games. I know better. I know that to even smoke one will set me off on the path to 2 packs a day again... I have been there before and saw it happen first hand. So, when does this stop? I am so proud of myself and I truly enjoy being a non smoker. But why did I catch myself looking at vape setups online? Why do I find myself thinking about going to the store to buy a pack when for those first 2 weeks it was never more than a passing thought that would come and go like a spring breeze? I do not want to vape or smoke. I am so far now that it would be foolish to do anything but soldier forward... I KNOW this, logically. But my stupid addict brain keeps trying to tell me I am missing something, that I would be so much happier with my old cigarette friend. BUT... that nasty cigarette was no friend of mine. I know this to my core. Grrrr! Frustrating guys... so very maddening. I will stay strong. I know this will pass and tomorrow or the next day things will feel better again, but damn this sucks right now.

Of course, it is not helping that I have to meet this morning with my ex-husband, who is a very heavy smoker. We've been split coming up on 2.5 years and I still feel stress every time I see him. He smells of cigarettes always and it's a reminder of those 18 years we spent smoking together. Ew.

Today is also my eldest son's birthday... 17 today and so, for him, I will not smoke today... but I will gladly take and hold close any words of encouragement my friends here have for me.

I will beat this, right? Yes. I. Will.

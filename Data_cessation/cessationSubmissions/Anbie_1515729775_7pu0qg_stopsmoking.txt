Not even 24hours.

I’m sitting here with a dull headache and disgust in the pit of my stomach. 

I thought I had the right mindset, I do have the right mindset but still, STILL I have the desire to light up. I want to go outside and light one up to finish writing this post. Yet, I know exactly the reasons why I shouldn’t, every single con and not one pro of why I should have one. 

I quit last night at 8pm. I went to bed on top of the world, that I was finally free. I woke up at 6am and my first reaction was to go outside. Remembering that I quit, I grabbed my coffee and sat there for an hour. It’s amazing how much more time you have when you’re not smoking. I got ready for work, with the small voice in my head that’s telling me I want a cigarette. I make it through work, which is something I enjoy very much so and don’t think about smoking. It’s as soon as I get into my car, that voice is suddenly magnified. I knew I had over 20miles to get home and that if I had just “one” I would be fine. I would make it! 

I actually stopped and bought a pack. I couldn’t even look the cashier in the eye. I lit one up right away and immediately felt light headed and sick. Did I stop? Nope. Did I have 2 more before I got home? Yep. 

I thought for sure my boyfriend would have smelled it on me and busted me but he didn’t say anything. Knowing their in my glove box is killing me and I’m trying to find an excuse to get into my car and drive but knowing I can’t with a winter storm on its way. All the while knowing I’m putting poison into my lungs. I’m a smart woman, and it’s killing me that it’s this hard to quit something when I quit things all the time! (Drinking, meat, dairy, etc.)

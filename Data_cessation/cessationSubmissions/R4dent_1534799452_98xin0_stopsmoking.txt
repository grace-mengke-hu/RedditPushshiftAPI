Day 1

I'm here at the end of Day 1 feeling quite good about myself (and quite pissy with everyone else). I managed 5 and a half months before and smoked because I was injured and had no outlet for my stress at a particularly difficult time. Looking back it was a silly excuse so I'm keeping the feeling of how foolish I was before fresh in my mind. The first two cigarettes were absolutely awful. They fogged my brain and tasted awful. I had to wait to have that nicotine more stuck in me before I started to enjoy smoking again and I need to remember how truly awful and stupid it would be to put myself in that position again. It was meant to be a one off as well but within a fortnight I was back on each day.I hope I can keep on the right path this time.

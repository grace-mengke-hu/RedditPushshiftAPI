Last Cigarette about an hour ago.

What can i expect from the next few days? I have read about physical and psychological side effects, but what can I expect from peers and family? MY husband and parents and siblings are all smokers. What are some tools I can use to be around them and not smoke? I am just worried and nervous but reading these stories have helped. What were some things you went through quitting cold turkey that maybe weren't in the reading? All advice is welcome and appreciated.

It's officially been one week...

and I feel great! Last Friday I went all out and bought a new vape and juice and I haven't even wanted to touch a cigarette since. I'm so glad I took the leap, I feel 1000x better just in this past week. For all of you contemplating switching to vaping as an alternative, I would highly recommend it :) Thank you r/stopsmoking for being a great community and support group!

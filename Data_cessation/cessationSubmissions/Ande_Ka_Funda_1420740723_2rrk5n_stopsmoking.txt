Day 7 and a dilemma :

Day 7 and a dilemma :

So past 7 days have been amazing. I've defeated cravings after cravings. Without any patches.,
The secret was that I have convinced myself that my life from here on will be accompanied by Withdrawal Symptoms and I should jut let it happen. Not try to mitigate it by any reason. So I didn't need any patch, gums , e-cigs or anything.

And so far it's been ok. Some extreme cravings and some real sad times but never did I not understand that it was all part of the process and I should not try to fight them. I could be Happy and proud and be uncomfortable at the same time.

Now I know how easy it is to fail and one puff can indeed be deadly. But here's the thing:

I rarely go to pubs (once a month maybe) but when I do I don't hold back. Tomorrow I'm going to a pub and I do really want to experience the high of "Cigarette and Alcohol".Not just the alcohol high .
It's not my craving that's talking right now. As I'm pretty comfortable right now.

Will that be deadly?

UPDATE : I didnt smoke. Not one puff. 
I feel like a non smoker now. 

Ah,  what a feeling. Day 9 begins

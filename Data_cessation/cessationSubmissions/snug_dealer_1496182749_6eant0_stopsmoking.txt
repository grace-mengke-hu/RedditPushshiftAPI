I want to want to quit

I'm 24, started smoking cigarettes last year to cope with a PTSD diagnosis. I smoked for maybe 5-6 months, quit for 2 months, and am back at it again. When I quit for those months, I wanted to stop for good. I wanted better for myself. But I've slipped. Stress is getting to me, and I returned to cigarettes.

Now, I don't really want to quit anymore. I'm addicted. Even in those two months, I had dreams of smoking cigarettes. And watching/reading a bunch of things that involve cigarettes, I kept thinking how nice it would be to smoke again. When I picked up my first pack after the break, I felt powerless. I think that's definitely an emotional trigger of mine to want to smoke.

I want to do better by me. I want to do better by my SO. I need a stronger will. I keep saying this will be my last pack, then I cave. What can I do to help get over this? I need help finding the starting line to recovery.

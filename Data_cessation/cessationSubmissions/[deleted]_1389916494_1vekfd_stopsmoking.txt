Who, me?

Was parked in a car waiting for a friend this morning when this lady walked by about two cars away from me and kept pointing at me and then making motions to her mouth like she was holding a cigarette, I thought she was talking to someone else for a minute and then I pointed at me, "Who, me?" I mouthed, and she mouthed "Cigarette?" And I shook my head no.

I know how she feels, when I smoked I would ask any stranger for a cigarette at times, and I guess it's been a while since I last smoked so I didn't realize how much I **don't** miss that feeling at all. Thanks /r/stopsmoking! :)

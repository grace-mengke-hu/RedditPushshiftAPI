Is this the real life?

Well, I've made it 25 days. The extra two days of my life that I've gotten back has made it feel more like months. I feel like a fraud because I have had a really easy time of it. My worst cravings were actually in the past couple days. I think about smoking(there are always cigarettes here) and I wonder why. I wonder why it was so difficult when I was smoking not to have a cigarette every time I thought about smoking. There have been no major changes in my life, but a bunch are coming up. I feel confident and perhaps a little optimistic. 



Besides the usual, I think my depression has eased a bit. This may have to do with grieving taking it's place, or it may have to do with not putting poison in me. I'm not sure. I'll see how the next couple weeks go. I normally have an episode once every month or two.



Thanks to all of you for giving me a new habit to pick up ;) This subreddit is so decent.

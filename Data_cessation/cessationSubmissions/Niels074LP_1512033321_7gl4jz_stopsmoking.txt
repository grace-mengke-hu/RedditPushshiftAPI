28 days smoke free.

Today marks 4 weeks, after smoking up to 25 a day for 6 years I finally freed myself of the shackles of cigarettes. I don't hate them, I just realise I don't need them anymore. I can live my life perfectly fine without them. I do have occasional moments of missing them, but I just have to make the conscious decision that the next cigarette likely costs me Eighty-Thousand-Fucking-Euros. I rather buy myself a cool Porsche sometime in the future. 

Next step is losing all this weight, using my newly found energy. 
Cheers all of you, for the extra motivation, here is to not smoking for the rest of our lives! cheers.

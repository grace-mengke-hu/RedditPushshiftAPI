Just a different thought about smoking and cancer (and trolling your addicted brain logic)

I used to think, well im 30 now, I can keep smoking and by the time i get cancer in 15-20, or 30 yrs, surely they would have found a cure for it by then. These days i'm thinking the opposite; you know what, i'll  actually stop smoking until modern medicine eradicates cancer, then ill smoke again! Now my brain thinks, it's ok, we'll smoke again as soon as cancer is cured. Funny how a little logic twist works wonder for the psyche.... Just thought i'd share :)

Didn't realize I was *so* hooked until..

This morning, when I got to the bus station downtown and thought I forgot my smokes (I set a quit date, just not there yet. I'm working on it.) There's nowhere to buy cigarettes near that area so I would have missed one of my habit times. 

When I found them, I had this huge sense of relief come over me. Then I felt this huge sense of guilt when I realized this is what I've become. 

I have traded in all of my past addictions and kept this last one. I've held onto it for dear life, because it's the only one I have left.

Now I have more determination than ever to quit. That's the one positive thing I can take from all of this.

Thanks for listening

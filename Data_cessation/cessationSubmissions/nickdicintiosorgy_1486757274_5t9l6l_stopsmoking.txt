Quit Smoking Over 2 Years Ago... Suddenly Wanting to Again?

I quit smoking August 27th, 2014 over the course of 2 weeks. It was a relatively easy quitting process because at the time I was feeling sick constantly and my anxiety from the nicotine addiction spiral was through the roof. After about two months I'd stopped thinking about smoking, and I was feeling so much better physically that I really didn't miss it at all. I have taken a few drags of friends' cigarettes (mostly while extremely drunk) over the past few years, but I always felt sick afterwards and it was never something I thought about sober.

Since then, I've gone through graduating college, moving across the country twice, job loss, and the loss of a parent, and I never felt the urge to pick up smoking again. Lately, though, it's all I can think about. 

None of my friends smoke in the city I live in now, I rarely drink, and I'm not under an unusual amount of stress, so I'm kind of confused why this is happening now. Does anyone have experience with suddenly craving nicotine again after a long period of time? Any tips to counter this would be greatly appreciated!

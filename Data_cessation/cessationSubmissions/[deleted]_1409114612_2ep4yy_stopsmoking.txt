4 Days now but I guess I'm not sure I want to quit? Can anyone offer some motivation? Any advice how to remain tobacco free around alcohol?

**Warning**:  This will be long.  Writing about it helps me get my thoughts in order whether or not anyone bothers to read it. You can skip forward to section 2 if you want to read about an immediate problem and offer specific practical advice. 

4 days and counting since I had my last cigarette but I'm struggling with sticking to this and was hoping someone could help with some advice or motivation?  Probably I'm not completely rational about any of this but maybe someone can say something that would make sense as I'm making the decision about whether to stick to my decision to quit.  

Some important background is that honestly my mental health is and pretty much always has been completely fucked (severe depression/anxiety) and that has a lot to do with my smoking.  I'm working on that stuff, it ain't easy though, some people are just born fucked in the head I guess.  I dunno, it really does seem like shitty things happen to me often and good things rarely do, no matter hard I work or what I succeed at.    Smoking has always been appealing as a way to hasten my death and express my pessimism, honestly I feel like I'm losing a part of my personality giving it up.

I'm trying to even remember why I'm trying to quit and it seems like really stupid reasons.  My life has sucked for a while but I'm making some big changes, starting a new graduate program in a new city.  I confessed my feelings to my love of like 3 years before leaving.  It's a very complicated story, she dated my loser friend, left the country, was back for 1 month and is seeing some new guy casually.  We kissed and i think she has some feelings for me but being a thousand miles apart I dont know where it can go, only that I have feelings for her I hardly can ever have for somebody because people are fucking bloodsuckers who have let me down most my life.

I don't really understand it, I'm obviously not quitting for her, besides literally everyone she ever dated has been a smoker so it's not like it's a dealbreaker, but kissing her was the only unequivocally decent thing to happen to me in the last 3 years or so.

I guess I'm just worried that after decades of shit and wishing I were dead and trying to keep going on and do the right things while hoping things can change something good will happen to me like I get a decent job and can live with this girl I love and that moment I'll be diagnosed with cancer and die.  It would be a sick joke, my life being like that, and given how things have gone so far I think I have every reason to expect that's exactly what will happen.  So maybe I'm trying to quit smoking to preserve that sliver of hope I have now?  But why am I even doing that if I know how impossible it is with this girl and I have a lifetime worth of experience of being unable to have healthy intimate relationships anyways?

I hope I die soon.  

**Section 2: weekend boogaloo**

So this weekend Imma be staying in a hostel in this city where I don't know anyone while waiting to move into my new place.  I am having a hard time thinking of anything to do with that time except drink and I really don't think I can go get wasted all weekend without going back to smoking which would be stupid and blow up like a week's progress but fuck it I have a lot of anxiety and need to be in a big crowd of drunk people who will pretend to be my friends.  

So if any of you gurus know how to drink without smoking as a recent quitter or can help me think of some other things I could do with that time (nights that have me worried) I'd be really appreciative.  The only other thing I can think to do is find a card table but that's probably going to get me smoking too especially if I'm losing!

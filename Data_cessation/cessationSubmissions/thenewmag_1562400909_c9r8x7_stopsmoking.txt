More than 20 days SmokeFree COLD TURKEY. What a difference all round:-

- My breathing has improved so much. I can actually have a good nights sleep 😴 
- My teeth seem whiter 🤷🏽‍♂️
- No more going outside in the rain or cold to light up 😁
- I can taste all my food 😋 
- I feel more energetic; not only am I exercising more, I can also see to the wife in the bedroom with confidence 😉. 
- I’ve been told I seem more confident in myself. 
- No more of that smokers cough or funny breathing
- I’ve currently saved nearly £100 ($125), meaning I’ll be at nearly £2000 ($2500) by the 12 month stage. So next years’ vacay will be funded by quitting the cigs. More places to see the wife to 😁. Winning all the way. 

As the title reads, I’ve done this cold turkey. I started off with an e-cigarette but found that I was coughing even more so threw that out. I said to myself, “if you’re gonna quit, quit it all”. I last spent money on smoking more than 20 days ago and the benefits already are fantastic. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT DISGUSTING HABIT EVER AGAIN! 
Anyone not quit yet on this forum/site, all I can say is it’s a no brainier - not only will you feel better and save money at same time, but you’ll look better too; a total bad ass win win 😁

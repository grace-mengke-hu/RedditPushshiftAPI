Survived a 20 hr work day, somehow didn't smoke.

You'd think that after going cold for more than a year, I'd be good...nope! Well, last night was a 20 hr work day under stress. At several points, wanted to just join colleagues in lighting just one for stress relief...somehow, dodged the thought.       
The fight is still on :$

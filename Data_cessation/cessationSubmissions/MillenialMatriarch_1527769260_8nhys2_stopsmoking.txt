Week 2 and beyond...

I've successfully entered the 2nd week no nicotine. The physical withdrawal is over and the fogginess is lifting.  This tends to be dangerous territory for me where the quit feels "boring" or "easy enough to stop and start again".

I know that's completely false, and it's done me in on many past quits.  

How have you managed your transition to smoke free living? Any routines or mantras that keep you going?

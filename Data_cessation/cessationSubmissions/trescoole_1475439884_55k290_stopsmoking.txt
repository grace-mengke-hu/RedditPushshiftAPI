I did it. My first week ever without a smoke.

I've been managing to get 2-3 days then went out for drinks and sure enough I went home with a pack of smokes. This past Sunday I reset the timer on my quit app and said. F it. You're doing this. 

It's been a week. I feel really proud of myself. I can breathe a lot better, wonderful smells are everywhere and my body feels great. I can't believe I was sucking down those damn cancer  sticks thinking I needed them. 

Had a small craving yesterday though. When a friend came over and we had a few drinks but I got through it. 

Next goal 2 weeks then a month. Here's hoping I don't cave. And thank you all for being here reading this and the support. Both in your own stories and upvotes. I hate battling this demon! Reading what you post makes it easier. üëç

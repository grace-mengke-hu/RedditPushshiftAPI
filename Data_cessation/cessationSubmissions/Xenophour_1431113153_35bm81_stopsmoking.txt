60 days, on holidays, going strong!

60 days today. On holidays at the moment (with EVERY single person from my family & extended family smoking) and I'm going strong!

This lovely community helped me through my hardest times, It's enabled me to better my life and I've met some really cool and nice people! Thank you all so much!

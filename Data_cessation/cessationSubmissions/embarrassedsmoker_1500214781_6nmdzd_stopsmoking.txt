I have 2 weeks to quit for good. Hit me with any advice you got.

I'm unexpectedly pregnant with my 3rd baby (I was on birth control).  I'm 32 and have smoked on and off since I was 15.  I never full quit when I was pregnant with my son 12 years ago, but was thankfully already quit when I got pregnant with my daughter a few years ago.  

I quit cold turkey in 2012 by spending lots of time in bed, sleeping off the withdrawals and taking good care of myself.  In 2016 I left my abusive marriage (and unfortunately picked my cigs back up), and now am trying to do it all with full time care of my 2 year old and 11 year old, who is disabled and has special needs.  

This pregnancy was a shock to me and I was smoking 2 packs a day when I found out.  I'm currently down to about 10 a day and my OB told me that if I quit by 14 weeks, I have the same odds of having a low birth weight baby or premature labor as a nonsmoker and my baby is unlikely to be harmed.  I'll be 12 weeks tomorrow.  

I tried to quit cold turkey this week and it didn't go well.  After about 15 hours without a cigarette I was a dizzy mess with a migraine and 2 kids wondering why mom didn't want to get off of the couch.  Naps, sleeping it off, resting, etc are all options currently not available to me.  Unfortunately because of the pregnancy I am also unable to use the patch.  

So I have 2 weeks to be done with this gross habit.  I already feel very guilty and can't stand the thought of continuing to smoke after that window of time my doctor gave me.  Taking any and all suggestions.  Just for informational purposes, I've read Allen Carr's book before and it didn't do much for me, but that was years ago.  Not opposed to trying it again.

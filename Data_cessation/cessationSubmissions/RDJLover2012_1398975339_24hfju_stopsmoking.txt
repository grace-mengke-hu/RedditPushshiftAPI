Here I go again.

Today is a my first full day. 
I keep finding excuses why I shouldn't quit. Its soo frustrating.
Last time I quit I went for over 200 days and that was almost a year ago. Life happened and I let it get the best of me, but I'm ready again.
 
I just have to stop making excuses, and quit trying to give myself a reason to go to the store and buy a pack.

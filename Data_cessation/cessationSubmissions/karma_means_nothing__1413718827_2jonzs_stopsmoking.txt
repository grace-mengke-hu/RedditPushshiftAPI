RESFO, a Spanish clinic that claims to cure smoking addiction.

[The site is in Spanish](http://resfo.com/sesiones-de-resfo-sin-peligro-y-sin-dolor), but Google translate tells me they use coloured light therapy to restore the frequency of healthy cells to prevent passing on the habit from old cells to new ones. 

The strange thing is that I haven't found any other info on whether this is a legitimate operation or not. A friend of mine wants to go there but I'm naturally sceptic.

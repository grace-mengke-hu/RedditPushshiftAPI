Day Three!

I was sick a couple of days ago and hardly got out of bed, leading me to not smoke for a whole day. The next day I felt better but decided to keep on not smoking! I am currently on day three and actually feel fine. Every time I want a cigarette I just say to myself "get through today, and if you still really want one tomorrow you can." It has worked so far!!

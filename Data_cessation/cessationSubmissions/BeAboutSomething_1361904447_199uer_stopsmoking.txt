I am a runner. After only 15 days, the difference is remarkable.

I smoked for 23 years.  The last 4 I have been a long distance runner.  Sounds ridiculous I know.  But I have done 10 half marathons and a bunch of other events.  I have been a consistent 10 minute mile runner until now.  Mile 1 was always tough.  Just this past weekend I have shaved a full minute off a mile.  

I now have to condition my legs to be faster which will come with training at a faster speed.  For nonrunners, a minute seems insignificant.  

I come here once a day to read up on peoples progress.  It's good to know there are many like me.

motherfucking six

six days. six days man. never in my life did i think i could go one. this shit is getting easier. i still want to drive my car into oncoming traffic or roll out while it crashes into my place of employment, but im not smoking. so i've got that going for me. plus my energy is coming back. and im happy to be a non-smoker so i dont smell like i was rolling around in wet cig butts. eclipse gum and a squeeze ball have kept me from smoking this far, and obviously this sub. i love this shit!

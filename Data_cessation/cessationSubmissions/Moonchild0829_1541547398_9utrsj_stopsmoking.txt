Are you kidding me?!?!?!

Ok, so I quit smoking almost 3 weeks ago. And I haven't slipped at all... I've had moments when I've wanted to, but I've stayed strong. Not one more puff, no matter what. Then today, I get my Camel coupons in the mail... And they're advertising the new look of my cigarettes and offering mobile coupons, and I was hit by a craving... Simply because they were offering me the chance to save a little bit of money. Nevermind the fact that I've saved over $90 since I quit. But hey, I can save $1 on two packs... What kind of twisted logic had my brain gotten used to that something like that could trigger a craving. Now it's gone away since I've started writing this; the pacing is probably helping, but I just felt the need to share and ask if anyone else has had a craving triggered by something similar. Not something you would expect to be a trigger, so to speak.

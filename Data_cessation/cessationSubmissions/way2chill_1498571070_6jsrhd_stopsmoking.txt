Harder and harder to not admit I've failed.

I quit smoking on November 24th 2016. The things that's been dangerous is joints, I live in NL, and weed isn't hard to come by and a lot of people in my circle do it. Somewhere in February my first drag of a tobacco joint occurred and since then it went from once a month to every 2 weeks to every weekend and now it's the 3rd day in a row my body accesses nicotine again, through joints. Of course I haven't smoked any cigarettes, but it's becoming harder and harder to not admit that I'm falling back into addiction... That makes me sad

I've quit smoking today

I'm not a stranger to making attempts to smoke. I've probably made well over dozens of attempts to quit.

Thankfully I'm done making my attempts today. After learning the "easy way" methodology by reading the book and also listening to the audiobook I still had my issues when it came to stopping. 

While the book definitely didn't work as a lightning strike to my conscious like I thought it would, it seems like it's just taken awhile for it to really catch up to me mentally. It's been a few months since my readings and slowly every cigarette started to taste awful and the idea that it was doing absolutely nothing for me started to become incredibly clear after each passing day. 

It's funny, at first I think I resented Carr. I disliked that he took away every satisfying thing without getting rid of my cravings. I just failed to realize that the only cravings that I had were the ideas that I still *wanted* to be a smoker, for absolutely no reason at all! The thought of smoking repulses me, seeing and smelling smoke gives me unpleasant chills, and when I'm actually having one I only want to stop. I'm honestly not sure exactly when this switch was flipped but I've realized that I don't need it, and I certainly don't want it. 

Like I said I'm not a stranger to making attempts to abstain so I felt as though this revelation would fall on deaf ears with the my family and close friends. I just feel so excited to be done with this horrible and disgusting habit that I wanted to share it with a like-minded group of people.

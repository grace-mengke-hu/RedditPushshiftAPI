Quitting smoking as of today, tips appreciated!

I'm a 23 year old male who has smoked on and off since 15. Usually that means 6-8 per day, ramping up when I'm feeling down or stressed. I've quit a few times before never longer than a month or two, but this time I want to be done for good. My girlfriend is against it, and keeping her happy means more to me than a few good cigs every day. Not only that, I want more energy, more money, and more health.

Does anyone have any good tips for quitting? I have patches, am using an app that tracks how long since my last, how much money I save etc., and was thinking of chewing mints or doing 5 push ups every time I felt like one. I want this done.

Thanks
:)

24 Days Smoke-Free

I quit 24 days ago, after getting drunk at a party and spending most of my time hounding people for cigarettes, I wasn't having a good time. I had far too many shots within an hour, cue the blackout. I've been smoking since I was 14/17, of course a friend introduced me to her mom's cigs and I thought *wow I'm a badass* she caught us and I didn't have the gall to try again until I was about 17. I used my older friends to buy me cigarettes, I was newly prescribed Adderall for my ADHD and the two went hand in hand. Many days of skipping class and smoking, smelling like someone's grand dad in my thick clothes. I didn't really want to quit until recently, my partner recently turned 30, never smoked, and I see where he is at 30 and I want to join him there. I want to start a family and begin to mould myself in that way. I made a promise to myself that I'd have to be 3+ years fully sober before I even thought about getting pregnant, especially thinking about the amount of damage I've done to myself. Has anyone made these kinds of promises before? I'm on track, cold turkey, and I'm trying not to let this overwhelming daunting cloud exclude me from having fun.

On day 3, help on what to expect over the next week?

I had my last cigarette on Friday afternoon and ive held strong all weekend. 


I stopped using the Allen Carr book and I'm not using any NRTs, I'm fully cold turkey. 


I've been trying to drink a load of water and green tea to try and speed up the nicotine leaving my system (heard physical craving tends to lessen after this) and I'm feeling pretty Damn good. 


Back in work tomorrow so it's my first day there as a non smoker. I used to take regular smoke breaks (at least 5 a day, if not more) so I feel it's going to be a test for me, but I'm staying positive and motivated. 


Can anyone tell me, from experience, what I'm likely to go through over the coming week? Am I over the worst or is all that yet to come? 


Thanks for keeping me motivated so far, this sub is great.

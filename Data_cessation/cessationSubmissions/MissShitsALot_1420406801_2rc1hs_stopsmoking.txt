Just finished Allen's Carr's Easyway!

I am so pumped! I feel really good. I ate a meal right after finishing the book and started to get that panicky feeling and just talked to myself to realize what it was and I just feel fantastic!

I am so excited I can't stop whistling and dancing around the house!

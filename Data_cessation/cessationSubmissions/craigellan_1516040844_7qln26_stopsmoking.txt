Just got back from 3 nights in Vegas and still going 2 months strong.

Wow, this past weekend was my first time in Vegas/heavy drinking since I quite smoking and it was torture!  A constant freaking battle.  First night at a strip club and I think everyone in the place was smoking cigarettes, ash trays were everywhere!  It definitely was really difficult, but glad to say I didnt cheat.  I used Snus for the urges.  I always knew Vegas was temptation city, but damn! Being an ex smoker there's a whole new level to Sin City.  Whenever I encounter an ex smoker or someone who is trying to quit, I recommend this sub.  I definitely couldnt have dont it with all you here.  To future quitters, you can do this! It's difficult and painful at times, but I promise you it is 100% worth it.  Smoking was my favorite thing in the world.  If you gave me the option of giving up sex, drinking, and sugar or smoking, I would have picked the three! That's how badly I loved smoking!  But I love being an ex smoker more.  Congrats to all you quitters out there and to you future quitters, trust me, YOU CAN DO THIS!  If this loser, (me), can do it, than you 100% can! Onwards and upwards!

Smoked for 10 years, would really like to quit

Today will hopefully be day 1 (I'm currently 8 hours in). I've quit for 3 months before, no problem, while I was in basic training for the Air Force, but the minute I came back home I started smoking again. 

I'm having terrible cravings right now, but keep pushing them off each time. But damn if I don't want to finish off one of the half-smoked cigs in the ashtray. 

I have goals, like being able to run again, having better skin, not being dependent on something. 

can you tell me your success stories and how not smoking has changed your life?

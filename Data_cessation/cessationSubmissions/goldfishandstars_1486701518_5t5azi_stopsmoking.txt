2 weeks not smoking after 12 years. Switched to vape and feeling great except for one unexpected side effect.

Constipation. What the hell?! I found it's pretty common for a few weeks after quitting but damn it's so inconvenient. Has this happened to anyone else after quitting? I would love some advice. And just to add, I have a very fiber full diet and drink at least a gallon of water a day, so I am hydrated and eating properly. I'm so ready to get over this "hump" and back to normal life and normal bowel movements.

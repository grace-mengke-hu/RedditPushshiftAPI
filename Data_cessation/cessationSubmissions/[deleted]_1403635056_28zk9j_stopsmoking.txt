I've tried before but this time I will!

Its all mental. When you have the will to quit, not because you know you should but because you actually do, its so much easier. Getting offered cigarettes from my coworkers I can easily say no. 

Albeit I am always searching for something to do with my hands like spinning a pen and I still get urges but I choose to eat or take a walk instead.

Just had to talk about it. I'm done :)

Day 18

Day 18 and probably having the worst cravings I’ve had this entire time. My anxiety is through the roof and I just want to snap at everyone. 
I’ve been having the worst dreams and woke up super anxious and needing a smoke - I’ve never been a morning smoker. 
All I want is a cigarette right now

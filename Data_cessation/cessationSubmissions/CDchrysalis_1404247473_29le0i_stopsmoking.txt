Husband still smokes

I quit in january 2013 and until a couple of months ago was fine.  I read allen carr's book and quit and never wanted another one.

Until recently.  My husband was supposed to quit with me and didn't.  Was supposed to read the book and didn't.  Would quit when A happened or B happened and didn't.

Not only is he not quitting, he is apparently just giving no fucks about chain smoking or ... it's like he consciously wants to smoke more and more and fucking more.

And I hate it, I hate still being a slave to it because guess what we have to do when we get to where we are going? Wait for him to smoke.  And ... on and on, you can imagine.

I hate smelling it. On him, in the car (no matter how I beg, on long trips he just HAS to give in) and I find myself nagging him.

And he is getting a new boat and swearing to quit then, and I know that he won't. I KNOW he won't.

I can't continue this way, watching him set a "quit date" by some thing that is happening/upcoming, knowing that even if he bothers to try, he won't, because he is half-assing the attempts.  

So I want to smoke again, to make the fights stop.  How stupid, right???  What kind of idiot.... This kind.  

UGH.  Of course I'm not, because that's what he wants.  Because then the pressure stops.  I want him to see how he looks, though.  I want him to see how desperate he looks, how weak, how small, how nasty.

Yes, I've told him all of this, and he says I'm picking fights with him.

It's been a year and a half y'all.

TL;DR:  How to dispose of a body?

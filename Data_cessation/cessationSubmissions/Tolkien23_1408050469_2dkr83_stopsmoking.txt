Relapse

I just had a relapse after a few weeks now of not smoking. I don't feel good at all about doing it. I had a lot to do at work, and, habitually, I used to smoke to get away from the stress for a few minutes.

If anything, this incident has solidified my desire to quit. There's no benefit in me getting back to my old ways, my old routine. Smoking provided me with nothing but a temporary release, a moment away from the chaos that I'll inevitably have to face again and again.

It's just hard. Things pile up around me and it felt good to just dump the stress off my shoulders, go outside for a smoke, and then come back to it a few minutes later. But living is hard, having responsibility is hard, being an adult and being a man is hard, because anything that's hard to do isn't worth having. Smoking was just a crutch that made life more tolerable, easier, albeit, in the long run, significantly shorter.

I'm not going to go back to walking through life on a crutch when my legs work just fine.

This is one of the best communities on reddit, and I'm promising all of you, right now, that I'm going to try that much harder to meet the standard set by all of you.

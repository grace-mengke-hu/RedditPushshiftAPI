I guess I misjudge you...

I'm not gonna lie i've been lurking on this sub for a while and you all have been really inspiring but my cinycal self could not help but judge and sometimes mock some of your posts. 
I kept feeling like this was somehow too cheesy, all of this "supporting each other through this". I kept thinking, I'm a grown man, if i want to stop, i'll stop on my own. But i kept coming back. And then I decided to stop. It's been a week now and I'll be honest, i would not have done it without you.

Thank you !

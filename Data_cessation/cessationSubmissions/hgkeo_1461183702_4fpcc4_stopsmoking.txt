To the long term quitters, why are you still here?

I've been told that once you quit for a good long time, you no longer think about quitting. I come here daily because quitting, and not smoking is what I'm thinking about for the most of the day. So my real question is, after a long term quit, what do you feel? Do you think you still need support? How often do you think about smoking? How does the addiction change and form over the months? Basically, I'm curious how life is like as a long term ex smoker.

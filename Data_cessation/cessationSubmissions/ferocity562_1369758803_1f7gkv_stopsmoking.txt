I did really well this weekend!

I went back home for a visit over Memorial Day weekend.  There was a large group of our social circle back home for a visit so it was just like old times.  Except for some key differences:

* I didn't smoke despite lots of drinking and social anxiety  
* I didn't smoke despite constantly being around tons of smokers  
* I didn't smoke despite being around all the people who I used to smoke with.  We all started smoking around the same time.  We all smoked together for years.  It was an integral part of our social group.  But not for me.  Not this time.

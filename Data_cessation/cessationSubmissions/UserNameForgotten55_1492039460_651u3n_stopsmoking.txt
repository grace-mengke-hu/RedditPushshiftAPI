Today I Discovered Yet Another Smoking Trigger

I KNOW (on the top-of-my-brain level) that I'm going to keep experiencing another "first-time for everything", but this one really, really made me sad. I'd been accustomed to coming home from work and sitting out in the back yard with reading material, an adult beverage and my smokes. My time to unwind and "come down" from the stressors of the day, appreciate all the good things that nature comes up with during spring, etc, etc.

only, TODAY. it's an amazingly beautiful spring evening, the best one here so far... and I can't do it. It's not because of the whiskey in my soda. Alcohol is not a smoking trigger for me; neither is the reading, I am fine doing both of those things, nicotine-free, indoors. Sometimes even at the same time!

It's the combination. The Total Combination used to be: book/cocktail/smokes/smokin' buddy(daughter)/good ole dog. Well, smokin' buddy (daughter) got married, moved away and quit smoking (she's my role model!). Sad to say, good ole dog passed away 16 months ago. And now, no more smokes. The backyard is no less beautiful for all this (maybe even more so, given the absence of dog poo? LOL), but the impulse to buy/smoke is SO STRONG that for the time being, I am uncomfortable hanging out in my own backyard. WTF, I don't even really want to actually smoke a cigarette, I just really strongly feel that i SHOULD be, because that's part of the whole sitting-in-the-backyard-after-work thing.

Anyway, I just typed all this out rant-style because I reasoned that if I'm writing a post, at least I'm not walking (yeah, it's about 1 1/2 blocks away!) to the nearest store. I'm doing the breathing and the lollipop therapy.

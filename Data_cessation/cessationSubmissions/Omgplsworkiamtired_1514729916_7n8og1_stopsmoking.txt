New here! I quit smoking on Dec 23!

The first time I tried smoking was in the fourth grade. Then I really started smoking when I was 14. 
I quit cold turkey for both pregnancies but started back up as I was weaning from breast feeding. 

I am 32 now. I was just retested for ADHD and I found out I have ADD/ADHD now and started adderall in October. 

For me smoking was about finding a purpose for ADD. Couldn't focus or get started? I would smoke a cigarette. 

I have done cold turkey again after months of just getting for and more frustrated with myself. So far I am 8 days in!

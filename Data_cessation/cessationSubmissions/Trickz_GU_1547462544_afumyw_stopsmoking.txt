This attempt will be the one that works.

Cigarettes have started tasting bad, I feel less enjoyment from the act of smoking and have noticed more and more that people around me are successfully quitting, thus less people to talk smack with while having that 'smoko' break.  


I work in a very stressful industry (Live production) and am thus usually surrounded by touring engineers who smoke, riggers who smoke, etc etc. I want to eventually be able to stand out in the loading dock with people who smoke, having a chat and not feel the overpowering urge to smoke.  


I am building a house with my fianc√© and it's going to be a big hit on the bank - I do not need to smoke anymore.  


Please feel free to drop any pointers or tips, I will read every single one and appreciate it.  


Thank you all in advance; and to anyone who has successfully quit to this date - You Rock!

Going 3 months strong without a smoke, but my chest recently began hurting.

I just had 3 doctors appointments in the last month for various things I've been following up with (not related to this). They've all listened to my chest and ran blood pressure monitoring and checked my pulse. Over-all, I'm healthy.

I smoked 5 years and I'm 27. Just last week I began having a cramp in my lungs (similar to when I used to smoke) - just a sharp kind of cramp that would come and go in my chest. And then this morning I woke up and my chest hurt to the point it was hard to turn over (it felt like either I slept in a weird position, but any slight movement of my upper body would bring on the chest pain). Any little movement would cause irritability in my chest. I went back to sleep and woke up and it's all fine, but is it normal for there to be chest cramps up to 3 months after quitting?

Edit: However, I do smoke e-Cigs, but I'm not sure that has anything to do with it.

100 days!

Cannot believe it! Recently went to america where I was with smokers and somebody left a smoke in my apartment and I considered smoking it as I was "on holiday" I put it on top of the picture frame and "mulled it over" then forgot about it and when I saw it again I thought to myself don't be an idiot, you've hit 100 days! Handed the smoke back and was incredibly proud of myself, I feel as if I truly have come out the otherside! No need for it, no want for it! haha today is a good day!

In need of support

I was in a trip for 3 days by the sea. I kept having the same constant urge of needing to smoke. I don't know why because I've already been smoke free for over 2 weeks and I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms.
In the end, I didn't smoke but there were moments where I felt no confidence at all... Is this how it's going to be whenever I am on a trip/having a nice dinner/been drinking?

How long do cravings last?

It’s been just over a week since I smoked my last cancer stick, every so often throughout the day I’ll have a craving, it’s usually pretty mild and goes away after a minute but sometimes I find myself thinking about it for a while although I’m very certain I’ll never smoke again

I’m just wondering when these cravings will last me, I have been dreaming about fags, being offered one or buying tobacco and feeing like shit, however I’ve never smoked in my dream either 

I think if anything i just need some people to tell me this is normal and I’m not crazy

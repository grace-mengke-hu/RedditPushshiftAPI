I've slliped.

I allowed myself a puff in mid december, the next day i smoked one, by christmas i found myself buying a pack and making stupid excuses to myself.

I smoked 7 packs from christmas to 2017, at 00:00 01/01/2017 i stoped again.

I'm feeling a little craving, but i'm already used to overcome it, and a huge part of cravings is just me obcessing over it and overthinking it.

I would like to know if any of the guys that have stoped for a long time, if this happened to you too? How did you guys managed? should i change my quit date? 

i really dont feel like changing it. It would suck if i just throw it all away like it didn't mean nothing.

English is my second language, sorry if i expressed myself badly.

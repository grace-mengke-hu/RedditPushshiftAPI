Quit smoking (40 days) but depressed

This is the longest I've gone without a cigarette. A staggering 40 days. I still get cravings pretty regularly, but not enough to make me smoke. I still 'desire' a cigarette but I hate them and don't want to smoke anymore. I feel pretty confident I've made it through.

But one thing that is really bothering me is I am depressed that I smoked for 12 years and did the damage to my body that I did. I don't have any 'known' health problems from smoking but I fear that I have made myself likely to get cancer in the future or have shortened my life. Esp after reading stories about people getting lung cancer in their 30s (I'm 32). How do I get over that fear and be more positive?

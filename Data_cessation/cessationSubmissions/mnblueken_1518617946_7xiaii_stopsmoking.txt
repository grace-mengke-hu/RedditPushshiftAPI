I did it without even realizing it.

Sorry for the long story TL;DR provided.  So its Valentines day, happy Valentines day all, and I didn't get my wife a card or anything this year.  I've been so focused on changing my life around the past few weeks that I totally forgot.  Given the fact that I am quitting smoking to her delight (she hated me smoking) and making healthy changes,  I'm sure she would totally understand and forgive me this year. Also, we both agree Valentines day is overrated.  However, she has been so supportive during this I decided that maybe I should at least get her a card and some chocolate to tell her that I really appreciate her support during this and everything else.  So I got up early this morning, got in my car and drove to the store.  I got what I needed and promptly got back home to set it up on the kitchen table.  Luckily I made it back without her noticing.  I realized, when I got home,  that I drove past 4 places (twice) that I could've purchased smokes.  I didn't even think about it at all during the dive!  I just drove there and back like a normal non-smoker would and didn't once stop or even think about it at all.  I'm so happy with myself that I had to share this with you all. I smoked for 25 years and purchased the smokes one pack at a time (never a carton).  It was a ritual to stop every morning or evening to purchase smokes.  Its already becoming normal NOT to do that.   I'm shocked and surprised  by this and happy.  

Thanks again for reading this, it's fun to share success stories with others that are going or went through this as well.  

(TL;DR I drove past 4 stores this morning without even thinking and didn't stop to get a pack at all)

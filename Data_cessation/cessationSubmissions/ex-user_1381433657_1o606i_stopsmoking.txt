Benefits I am enjoying already-

1) My diet is changing as I can already appreciate foods with more subtle taste. Food doesn't need to be heavily spiced, salted or sugared in order for me to enjoy it. 

2) I am getting better quality sleep and waking up more easily. My baby is teething and not sleeping well and I can STILL say that.

3) I smell great. I even went out after I made it past the "detox" period and bought a new perfume. It was nice to know it wasn't going to be used to cover up smoke stink.

4) Speaking of stink- I was occasionally having some BO that I decided to attribute to hormones, but that has gone away completely.

5) My skin is also improving. Breakouts are fewer and I would swear that my complexion is brighter.

6) I love how much cleaner my mouth feels. Before felt like a constant battle to fight off the gross that I was inflicting upon myself. Not any more!

7) I have so much more energy and my ability to focus has improved drastically. I never realized how distracted I was before. My whole life revolved around smoking and letting it own me was causing me more distress than I even realized. 



How bout you, friends? Which benefits are you enjoying today?

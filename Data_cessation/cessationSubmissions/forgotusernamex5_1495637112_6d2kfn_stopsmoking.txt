Can you still be part of the community with aids?

*Title gore- by aids I meant quit smoking aids.

Quit Sunday night at midnight, on day 3 now, no cigarettes. I had a major breakdown on Monday night, I went out and got nicotine gum. I refuse to smoke again, but cold turkey was too hard for me. I have a PTSD diagnosis- not an excuse at all, but I was seriously out of my mind and I feel at risk. 2 gum Monday, 6 gum yesterday, 1 gum so far today. I see a lot of people really discourage the quit smoking aids, can I still be part of this community with the gum? Does it still count? :/

I feel so insane, when will this stop? Will it?

Questions about quitting with NRT

Hello! I've been checking out this page for a while before I joined and I have to say it is so great to find a forum where people are so supportive and understand what going through this is actually like!

I smoked heavily for ten years and I am finally quitting using nicotine patches. I had tried CT a few times unsuccessfully so I figured I'd work through breaking the habit first and then deal with the nicotine withdrawal when I'm feeling more confident (smoking was a big part of my "personality" so to speak so I'm still learning to identify as a non-smoker).
I was just wondering, I've heard a lot about this whole "quitter's flu" thing and I don't have any symptoms yet (day 12). Not to say I was looking forward to feeling sick, but I was looking forward to my lungs cleaning out and I'm a bit disappointed I haven't developed a cough yet. Is this because I'm using nicotine still? Or am I being  impatient? Anyone else using NRT having a similar experience? Does everyone get quitter's flu?
Secondly, the patches want you to use 6 weeks of the highest level (21 mg) but they only sell enough in a box for 2 weeks and they're like a gagillion dollars (though less than 6 weeks of smokes admittedly) so I'm wondering if I can just speed it up and go ahead and step down to the 14mg ones? I'm nervous about relapsing but I'm almost done with my first box and I'm kind of skeptical about whether 6 weeks of the highest dose is really necessary. I already forgot to put one on yesterday morning and I made it through the whole day fine until a bad craving around bed time but that's kind of normal anyway since it used to be my favorite time to smoke. Thoughts? Anyone else tried this?
Thank you for any advice and best wishes to everyone! Stay strong!

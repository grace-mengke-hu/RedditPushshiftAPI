Doing the patch, 1st day

Smoked a pack a day for 8 years, read the Alan Carr book, which helped a bit.

I need to kick this. Damn. The patch helps. But why do I want to have a cigarette a lot? I'm on the 21mg patch. 

Anyone know how long it takes for the oral cravings to stop after starting the patch? I just want to not think about it every half hour.

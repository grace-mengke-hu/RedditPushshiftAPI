8 more days to go before I hit my first month

It is amazing to think that I have not gone this long without smoking in over 20 years. I am taking a 150mg of Zyban a day. Initially it slowed my smoking down to 1 a day because it didn't taste as good. Then I started getting a little used to it and started having a couple a day. After being on it for about 3 weeks I finally woke up one day and said I do not want to smoke anymore. What a great feeling!

I have been reading this sub the whole time. Thanks for all the posts, they have helped me!

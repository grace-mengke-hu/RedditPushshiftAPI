My husband quit today. Can you help me help him?

It’s not the first time, but I want it to be the last. This is the first time I’ve ever seen him struggle with it so hard. This evening he looked so defeated. His eyes were red, bags under his eyes, his hair was unkept. He didn’t look like himself.

I have learned to be patient. Supportive. Give him space. Affection. Ask him if he needs anything. Don’t ask him a lot of questions. Keep him fed. Allow him to take the lead. Offer rewards.

What are some things you appreciate from your SO, family or friends that help you to out one foot in front of the other?

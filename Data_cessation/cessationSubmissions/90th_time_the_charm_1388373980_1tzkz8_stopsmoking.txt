Scared of trying again, any words of wisdom?

Hey all,

So I quit some time ago and had a few blunders but getting back on the smoke-free wagon had always been relatively straightforward. Recently I fell off again due to some family stuff (well, not 'due to,' nothing put a cigarette in my mouth...) and now it's been almost two months and I'm struggling to quit.

I made four attempts in the past two weeks. The first went ok, I actually made it four days before being stupid. The others lasted, at most, a day. I really don't want to be a smoker; I don't enjoy it anymore. I can't, however, find anything I want to do anymore. My last quit attempt was today, and like a lifeless shell I looked through the Reddit front page like twelve times (from start to 'random subreddit'). Every time I've failed I've felt more and more worse about myself and the 'well, fuck, is it even worth it?' attitude has been strengthening.

I made my quit day next Friday after work, but I'm scared. I don't like how I've been feeling these past attempts. Smoking doesn't really fix it, but stopping smoking makes it feel so apparent. The thing I used to really love doing - working out and staying active - I can't do while I'm smoking (I just can't, I feel like I want to die...) so I need to quit, but to quit I feel like I need that passion back for... something. I'm at the point where I'm so miserable smoking (like I feel every puff I'm wasting away), but I feel so lifeless quitting. The sad part is that I know in 2-3 weeks, it would all be over and I'd be back to that person I want to be, but that knowledge just isn't enough.

Anyway, I guess I'm hoping for some advice about making my way through that malaise or even just some 'Go yous' :D I'm fairly embarrassed about this - even made throwaway - but after so many failed attempts, maybe I need some external pushes.

Thanks!

You can do it!! And advice for weeners (1 month of no smoking)

I feel amazing. The cravings come and go, but my vape has helped me tremendously. What I'm doing is vaping at 6mg of nicotine and when I go 30 days without smoking a cigarette (which is today!!!! :D), I'll drop down to 3mg nicotine for the next 30 days and ween (yes, I'm a weener) myself off nicotine. 

Can't wait for this change. It feels so good not having to take a break from any physical exercise to sit down and have a smoke. My mind, my body, and especially my lungs (I can't hear myself breathing anymore!!) feel so much clearer already, I can't wait to see what the future holds. 

You can do it!!!!

a HATE a DAY #6

6 days ago, I made a promise to post 1 thing I hate about smoking everyday....day 6

"you're fired"

probably the #1 reason why I stopped smoking...keeping a career.

Anyone working in an office knows that sometimes there's a little downtime to be had, sometimes we raid the kitchen or chat up our co-workers down the hall. When work is lite or there's nothing to do...well, I smoked, so ya know where I was all the time. Being the only designer on staff and not really having to deal with clients or the boss all the time, made it really easy for me to sneak away. When it came time to brainstorm, design or evaluate I would HAVE to get my pre-work smoke on first. 15-20 minutes later I'd be back in the office stinking it up for everyone. I'd be so self conscious of the smell I'd avoid people for just as long and I'd often get dirty looks from the folks I sat next to or walked past. eventually, I was fired for wasting time smoking....this has happened 3 times.

I've changed career fields since then. I'm now a personal trainer....where I believe smoking is frowned upon to the highest extent of frown-ability. so yeah I had to quit, but that's ok.

Because DAMN!!!! I HATE SMOKING!!!

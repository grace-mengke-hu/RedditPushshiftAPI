Random trigger struck me yesterday..

Stumbled upon a very strong trigger yesterday. Went for my typical 5 week haircut that i usually schedule for 530pm on a Thursday. Got my haircut, came out of the salon and found myself searching my pocket. I wanted a cigarette. Chest tugging, nervousness, agitation all seemed to quickly follow. Quickly got into the car and drove home. Apparently, I absolutely loved my "its Thursday, almost the end of the week, after-work, post haircut" smoke.

Awesome self hypnosis app

It's too early to tell, but I listened to this 3x in 2 days, and I am, honestly, finding myself just not reaching for cigarettes as often. (Usually smoke 25/day. Have only had 10 today, which is totally unexpected.) 

It's "Quit Smoking with Andrew Johnson"

I have been talking about quitting and wanting to quit for a year - I am motivated, but I'm also pretty hooked. I rely on nicotine for stress management, tbh. I've been wrestling with patches for the past week... but this is doing something. 

I think it's ridiculous that it should, by the way, I got desperate and thought, "whatever". I listened to it on the subway yesterday, and again (twice) today. It's just a guided meditation with firm messages about how amazing you are for doing this, and how much your body hates smoking. I found myself easily meditating and accepting these messages, on at least the conscious level. It is affirming, if nothing else. Sharing in case it might help someone else :)   

You're supposed to listen daily for three weeks, I look forward to seeing what happens.

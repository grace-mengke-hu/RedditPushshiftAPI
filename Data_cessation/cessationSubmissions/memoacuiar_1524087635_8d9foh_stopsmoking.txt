I can't go a few hours without giving up

Holy crap this is hard. I've read Allen Carr's book twice and yesterday I watched a video with the same method. Those were the only times I really commited to quitting.

I woke up extremely irritable, but the thought of the "little monster" dying by lack of nicotine was giving me strength. As each craving passed, I felt great. But at around 5 PM I just couldn't anymore. EVERYONE I know smokes. Really. I dont have a single friend who doesnt smoke tobacco and/or weed (which I also struggle with). I couldn't pity them, as suggested in the book, I could only think about how great it would be to just get rid of the anxiety, the discomfort of not smoking or having cigarettes on me. I bought a pack and resumed smoking, feeling guiltier and guiltier and thus smoking more and more. Thinking about not having this crutch makes me want to smoke and drink to death. Im only 25 years old. I really never thought it could be this hard. I will try again tomorrow, but I feel hopeless. Nothing helps. I have deep psychological issues that I need to resolve, im always on the edge about something and these substances are the only thing that calm my mind. But i know there are better ways. I don't want to die from such a stupid cause. 

Sorry for the long text, but I really dont know what to do anymore. i cant keep smoking but I cant not smoke. Kill me

Trying to quit, but get bored

Hello everyone, thank you for all the great stories and posts that help me stay motivated.
So i've been trying to quit for a while now, and I DO want to quit, and when I'm home and have something to do, I can live fine without a cigarette, so usually it goes like this: I come home on friday, don't smoke all weekend, go to work on monday, get bored, go buy a pack of cigarettes to get through the day. And so on.
I'm new around here, so maybe this question was already brought up here (most likely), but anyway, what can be an alternative to smoking in terms of passing the time? 
Sorry for any mistakes, not my first language, and thank you in advance for your responds! Stay strong everyone!

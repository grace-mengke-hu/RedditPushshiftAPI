9 months but..

The start was difficult as hell but I knew I had to use all my self control, and I did. I've been successful for *9 effing months.* 9 months of forcing myself to stay away, reading articles about how it is bad for health and reminding myself that I don't want to give myself this slow and disguised death*.*

Switched to other stuff for anxiety relief + chilling + passing time. Cigs were like an accessory to me; always in my pocket. Could only smoke in solitude, though, since no one around me likes smokers haha. Got myself other stuff to fiddle with or keep in my mouth, switched to nicotine gums and it all kinda worked. It was more about self-control than any other thing, though.

**But** I crave those nasty cigs more than anything these days, they helped me most with my anxiety and I could always smoke when I was lonely and had nothing to do. Got nothing and no one now and I need my cigs again lol

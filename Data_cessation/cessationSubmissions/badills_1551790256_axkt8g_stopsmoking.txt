Rough Day.

The Smoke Free App says it has been 4d 1h 1m of smoke free.  I am not really feeling it today... I have a job where I can generally work from home, and I had a few cravings there but nothing like being in the office.  I feel anxious, I feel my mind is trying to JUSTIFY going out and smoking one... I am trying desperately to stop, but fee that my "mind" has already been made up.  I have a bottle of water, I have gum, and snacks (healthy and non-healthy). I have nicorette, and none of that is helping... I am concentrating now on how to get through the day 15 minutes at a  time and hoping I don't slip.... I know if I slip, it won't be a relapse but I will feel bad (see how I sort of "justified" smoking)?

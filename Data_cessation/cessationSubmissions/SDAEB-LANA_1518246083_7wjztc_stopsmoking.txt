Hi, I'm SDAEB-LANA, and I'm a smoker

Hi y'all, just discovered this sub yesterday, and I'm ready to be here, and embark on this journey of quitting this destructive habit with all of you. I've been off for a day and want to use this to chronicle my worst times and keep myself honest. I have smoked the most when I drive ( I do a TON of long distance driving), so I'll try to be checking in before I drive, and during stops in long trips. If anyone needs to talk, or just wants a friend, I'm here for you, and am just a pm away. We can do this shit together, no matter how hard it feels.

See ya around guys,

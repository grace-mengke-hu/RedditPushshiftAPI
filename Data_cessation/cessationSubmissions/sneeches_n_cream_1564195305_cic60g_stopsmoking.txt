Just had my last cig.

I’m ready for this. I’m 25 and told myself I would quit by my 26th birthday in September. I got myself a Juul to help with the cravings so I don’t break down. I have this nasty habit of becoming incredibly emotional and quick to tear up when I have attempted to quit before. I’m ready to smell better, feel better, not worry constantly about the carcinogens I’m putting in my body, and get a healthy glow back. I am a half pack to a pack a day smoker so I know this first week is going to be killer. However, I have made a pact with my friend that we will work out every day and she supports my want to quit. I don’t want to smoke anymore!!!

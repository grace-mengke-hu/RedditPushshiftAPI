Bitter taste in mouth? And other weird symptoms

Im 33 days smoke free, I smoked a pack a day for 11 years (started on 10 packs then graduated to 20 packs) and I quit cold turkey using Allen Carrs book. That book proved to be AMAZING, I've tried to quit so many times before but this book has made it so easy for me, it's literally been almost effortless to stop.

But I'm having some issues.

First is this weird bitter taste when I eat. Stuff I've always loved doesn't taste quite as good, I'm noticing stuff like how dry meat might be more, anything processed now tastes a bit worse, and stuff in general tastes a bit more bitter. Has anyone else had this? Is this common? It really sucks because I fucking love my food and things tasting better was one thing I was really looking forward to about quitting. 

Another weird thing is the shortness of breath. I'm often finding myself short of breath when I shouldn't be, after the lightest of walks - shorter of breath than I wad when I was still smoking. 
Sometimes I think it's because my nicotine cravings present themselves as constant hunger, so I have been eating too much and been very bloated and gassy lately. Its felt like my stomach has been pushing up on my diaphragm or something.

Also general bloating, lots of heartburn too.

I'm not super worried about the gut stuff, I read somewhere about how nicotine activates the gut so quitting often comes with a period of bowel unhappiness, and also I have plans to go back to Intermittent Fasting which always helps my stomach settle, but I'm worried about the taste in my mouth. 

I love to eat and I love to cook, and it's so weird for me that everything seems to taste worst since I quit... Any advice would be super helpful!

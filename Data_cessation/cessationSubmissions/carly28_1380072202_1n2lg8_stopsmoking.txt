can i have just 1?

it has been 8 days. day 7 and day 8 have been THE WORST. can i bum one from someone? that way i won't have a whole pack. thoughts? i am losing it. why is it getting harder vs. getting easier? i know everyone is different but it frustrates me that it's getting harder.  seriously the only thing in my life that's been worse than this was an emergency c-section. (i guess i should count my blessings)

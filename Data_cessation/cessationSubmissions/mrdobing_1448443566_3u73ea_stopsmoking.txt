100 days :)

Been a while since I've been here.

Just proves how it does get easier. I didn't even think about my quit for the last few weeks. It just seems natural now!  

It can be done very easily, just tough it through those first few weeks and you're on the home run.

I wish you all the best and good luck on your journey!

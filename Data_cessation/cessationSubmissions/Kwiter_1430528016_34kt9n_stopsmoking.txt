Almost thru day two

Wasn't as hard as day one, fortunately, but tomorrow is another day!

Been on Champix for 2 weeks, I'm sure it's helped & I haven't suffered as much as I may have going cold turkey.  No side effects to complain about either.  

Congrats & props to everyone else in their first week. Thanks for this supportive forum! Stay strong! Talk to you tomorrow.

I messed up again, I thought I had it this time.

Need a little encouragement you guys, I feel awful. I made it a week, but messed up hanging out with my step brother yesterday. We were watching some of the NFL games, and I had a few beers. His pack was laying on the table, while he was in the bathroom and I took one and lit it. I enjoyed about half of it, and then I was really down on myself. Time to reset again....

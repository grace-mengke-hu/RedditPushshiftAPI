Almost at two weeks and feel like caving

I've been having a rough week at work. I don't feel as productive as usual without taking a smoke break every two hours. I feel irritable about being underpaid. I mean, I was underpaid before I quit, but now I'm always thinking about it. I really want to smoke when I worry about money. Help!

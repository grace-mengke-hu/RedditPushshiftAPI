Took a picture of my last cigarette...

Not posting it here because that just feels cruel to anyone in the first week of separation. 

I remember feeling especially sad that night, and thinking I needed to document the moment. 

Looking forward to the day I have no sense of longing left when I look at that pic. A little more than 2 weeks in but I'm not quite there yet. 

Got pulled out of lurker mode earlier today for something else and Smoke Free's mission for the day was to tell people I quit. Nicely timed coincidence. So I'm introducing myself here after lurking for a few weeks. 

Pack a day smoker for 22 years. Doing this as a sort of modified cold turkey - meaning I do have an ecig on standby when the urge gets too much - but it's super low nicotine (1.9%) and I've actually managed to keep it to 2 - 3 hits once a day, or less. I think that's more psychological than anything else. 

I do appreciate the support here too - just reading and lurking here has been super helpful. So thanks for that. 

Hoping to not be wistful about that last smoke sooner than later though. I know that day will come...

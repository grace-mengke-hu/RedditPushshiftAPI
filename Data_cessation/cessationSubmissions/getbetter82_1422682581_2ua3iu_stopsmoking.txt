2 months

What can I say...Great decision so far. 

I'm 32. 14 years smoking. I used a e-cig for 15 days before I stop every form of smoke. 

I'm no longer counting the days, it's becoming natural. I'm running 3 times a week. First 2 weeks were hard but 2 months in and  I'm breathing incomparably better and still noticing improvements. 

It helps a great deal to start doing sports because you know smoking will harm your performance and if you are really focused on your sport goals, not-smoking becomes a secondary thought, like a consequence of you wanting to do sport. 

If you are focusing exclusively in not smoking the image of cigarettes will pop into your mind, which make it really hard on your lizard brain not to crave it. If you focus on other goals that consequentially include not smoking it will be a lot easier.  

Stay strong and remember that it's a ladder you climb daily.

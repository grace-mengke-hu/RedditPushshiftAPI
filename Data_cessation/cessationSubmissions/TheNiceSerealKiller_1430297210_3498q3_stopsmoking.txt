I made it... 3 days without a smoke!

I am an 18 year old university student and have been an off and on smoker for 5 years. I just finished exams and I am serious this time. No more nicotine. I'm tired of chewing tobacco and smoking. I'm tired of this need, and I'm tired of these awful fucking cravings.I wish I never started.

EDIT: Just so you guys know, I am chewing thrive gum (about 5-8 a day) and have an ecig ( 0 nicotine). I think I may actually be able to quit.

Ok, it's been 10 hours so far from my last cig in yesterday and i just woke up. How do i deal with craving after eating?

Every single time i eat a meal, I have the biggest craving, and I'm sure a lot of smokers do. It's just a habbit - I eat, therefore i smoke afterwards. Also, whitch day's are the hardest, the first 3? Or the first week?

EDIT: I have smoked for 7 years and trying cold turkey, is it doable?

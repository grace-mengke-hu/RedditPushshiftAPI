How do you guys do it?!

I made it to 2 days and went crazy! I was angry, couldn’t stop thinking about a cigarette, I felt weak, smoked and felt lame and thought this is hopeless, i am doomed...:( I didn’t reset my app, i don’t know what to think...this is aweful! And just before grabbing that fag i had problems breathing and was coughing my guts out...was it because my lungs started to clean up? After two days only?
Started e-cigarettes today, see if this works...
Is this because I’ve smoked for 11years?
I’m tired of telling myself everyday « i quit today » and then break down after 2 days...
I feel desperate

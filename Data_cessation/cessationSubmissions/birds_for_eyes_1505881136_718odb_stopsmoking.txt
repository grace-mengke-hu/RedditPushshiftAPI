Smoked the last cig in my pack. Will not be buying a new one in the morning.

So I recently picked up smoking again after an almost year long quit for pregnancy. I got mad at my husband one day and justified the 'just one'...well 3 packs later and I remember that I have a problem and it's never going to be just one. I haven't told anyone so I have been sneaking around and trying to find reasons to seclude myself to smoke. I really hate that. :(

This will be my 3rd time quitting, and hopefully my last. I just gotta get over the hump and then stick to peer support like this sub (something I hadn't tried before). Thanks for being here guys.

!URGENT! Feeling uneasy and butterflies in stomach since this morning. Help!!!

Guys,

Am into my 9th day of being smoke free. My day started good with a 2 hours gym session of lifting weight and some cardio session. But out of the blue am feeling uneasiness and kind of butterflies in my stomach and my mind is telling me that its the cigarette which is calling me to have it. I don't wanna do that. Unable to concentrate on things properly. Please help !!!! What should i do? I want to remain smoke free.  

I cant eat anything unhealthy given am on my strict gym diet. So no sweets etc.

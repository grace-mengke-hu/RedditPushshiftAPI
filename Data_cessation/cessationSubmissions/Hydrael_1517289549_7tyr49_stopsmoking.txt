Quitting starting today: one round of cancer was enough!

So I dodged a bullet.

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Four months of chemo, and endless doctors visit later, I was declared clean, yay! My Dr. pointed out that I was a high risk for cancer and needed to quit smoking, but I kept putting it off. Made it reasonably far with Chantix once, before the mental side effects of that drug kicked in and I had to quit. 

Last time I went to the doctor, they found what looked like an enlarged lymph node near my lung. On today's CT scans they couldn't find it so it appears that it was an aberration or a misreading of the initial scan, but I spent the entire weekend thinking the cancer was back, and this time it was in my lungs.

Today I quit to celebrate the news that it wasn't too late, that I hadn't waited to long. No more delaying - this stops now. 8 hours in and I'm already struggling hard, but after the scare I had this weekend I'm absolutely resolute not to fail again.

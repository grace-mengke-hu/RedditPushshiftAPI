I'm trying to stop smoking... again

Hey,

I'll give up smoking tomorrow for I-don't-acutally-know-which time. They've been so many, that I've stopped counting at some point. As Mark Twain have said: "Nothing is easier than to give up smoking.
I've done it a hundred times". But I think that this time it will really be the last one and I'll be done with that shit. Or at least I hope so. I can feel it fucking with my health and my budget. And that hurts, but not as much as the disappointment that you feel when you bend your knee and you stand in front of the mirror, with a lighten up cigarette, after you haven't smoked for a month. I fully realize I'm kind of lying to myself with that "I'll quit tomorrow" and not just as I type this.

Anyway, I really hope that this will be the end of it. Any kind of help/tips are welcome, thanks in advance.

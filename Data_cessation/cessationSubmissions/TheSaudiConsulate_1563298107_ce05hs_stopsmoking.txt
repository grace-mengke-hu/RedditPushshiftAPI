I need another way to slowly kill myself

I quit smoking ten days ago with the help of Chantix and it's been going great.  I've saved money, my lungs are clearing up, I can walk places without needing to have a cigarette, and I have more energy.  Great, right?!  The problem is that I think smoking, for me, was a way of passively committing suicide.  I would never actively commit suicide, mind you, but smoking cigarettes was a way to hasten my departure from this wretched earthly coil.  And it's not like the material conditions causing my passive-suicidality (i.e. the resurrection of fascism, the failure of wages to keep pace with the cost of living, and ennui, always the ennui) are getting any better.

Does anyone have any suggestions for slowly speeding my own demise?  Overeating is out of the question, since I am a gay and I don't want to be body-shamed by other gays.  Purposely contracting a virus is also probably out of question because I think that's viscerally pretty gross.

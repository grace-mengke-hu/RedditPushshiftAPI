Coming up on 2 weeks..

It has been a battle and I have had times when I almost lit one but I never did! Two weeks doesn't seem that long but I honestly didn't think I would be able to do it. I still have cravings but they aren't as severe and I can control them and shift my mind to other things when the urge to smoke gets heavy. Thank all of you who have given me some helpful tips and advice.. and thanks for talking me out of nicotine gum I think that was a big part of my success so far. So heres to 2 weeks tomorrow and 2 more after that!

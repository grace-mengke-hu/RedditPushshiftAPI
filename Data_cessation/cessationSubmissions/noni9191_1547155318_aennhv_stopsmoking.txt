Trying to encourage my (26f) bf (23m) to stop smoking cigs.

I've been with my bf for over 7 months now, and he hid the fact that he was a smoker for a at least two months; I honestly don't know how he did it... I'm usually very observant. Anyway, now that I know, he doesn't hold back. He smokes quite a bit. He said he's quit once before, and he started up again just before we met. Every time I express my concerns over him smoking, he gets defensive. He said that his mom has been on his back about it, too, but she doesn't nag about it every time he goes outside like I do, which makes him mad apparently. I've expressed that I just really care about his long-term health, and I asked him how I can best help him stop. He said, "just let me do it on my own." However, he has not been proactive about stopping at all. I'm wondering what else I can do? I'm worried.

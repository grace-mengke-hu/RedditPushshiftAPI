Serial quitters advice needed

Hi all! So I somehow became a serial quitter. Little backstory: I quit for approx 1 year with Allen Carr's Easy Way, then fell back in the trap. That was 1 year ago, and I just can't quit again. I usually don't have problems with stopping for 3-5 days, but I just keep making some f*ing excuses, and I go for just THAT one cig. So anyone has//had the same problem? Any advice how to overcome it? Or I just need to tighten up and make my commitment much stronger? Thanks in advance! Any tip//suggestion is much appreciated!

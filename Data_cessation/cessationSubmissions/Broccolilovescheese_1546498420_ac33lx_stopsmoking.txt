I just realized I'm a smoker. I thought I was just a "Social Smoker"

# TLDR; 

A friend confronted me about my smoking habits. I did some research and came across [this article from the NIH.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771192/)  The article talks about "social smokers". It defined that term, and described me eerily well (including my belief that my smoking habits are not a serious health risk). It went on to describe how the tobacco industry has had research on us and has been targeting us for 30 years. Now I'm quitting.

I got home last night from a weekend trip to visit out of town friends. They smoke, I smoked with them. Smoked about 15 cigarettes over 3 days. This morning, I woke up with a sore, phlegmy throat. I mentioned to a trusted friend that I smoked too much this weekend, and they took the opportunity to confront me about my bad habit. They said that they believes I smoke more than I think I do.   
This got me thinking, and I tried to consider carefully. Up until now, I've been believing that I smoke about a pack a month, but I bet if I looked at my credit card statements I'd find out it's probably more like two or three. So a couple hours ago, I decided to do some more research and see what patterns of cigarette use led to smoking. I came across [this article from the NIH.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771192/)   
The article talks about the rising prevalence of a population of smokers who call themselves "social smokers". It defines who social smokers are, and described me eerily well (including my belief that my smoking habits are not a serious health risk). It goes on to describe how the tobacco industry has had research on us and been targeting us for 30 years. It calls for healthcare professionals to consider alternate strategies and priorities in convincing us to stop smoking, and helping us to do so.   


Reading all of this turned my stomach. I've had these smoking habits for years and never considered myself "a smoker". I immediately trashed all my cigarettes and subscribed to this sub. Thanks for listening!

Day 6! Worst so far.

So I've been doing this one day at a time. I've been using a vaporizer and getting less nicotine than I'm used to and that has helped. Day 3 was the worst day until today. My brain is being an asshole and telling me that giving up smoking is a stupid idea and that I'll never be happy again. But my will is strong and I'm not about to go and relapse.

For all of you long term quitters, what was the first day that you felt significantly less cravings than usual? Or was it pretty gradual? And for people around Day 6, what's keeping you motivated?

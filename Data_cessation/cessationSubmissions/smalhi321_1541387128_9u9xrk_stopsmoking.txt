Smoke Free - Day 5!

Hello everyone, this is the first time im posting here after my day 1 entry,  I decided to post every 5 days here. 

So good so far, im really enjoying this. I’ve been 100 hours smoke free now and I feel amazing. I feel really positive and happy most of the time but sometimes anxiety hits really hard and that is the time when I crave cigarettes the most, but fortunately i’ve been able to resist all my cravings till now *hopefully will do in the future too*.  I feel more energetic and willing to engage in activities these for last 2 days. Although sometimes I feel really sad and depressed and irritated but in those situations I try not to loose my calm. I’m still working on it, any suggestions would be really great!

Also, it was the first weekend after I quit and I went out to have some drinks and I was really afraid that I would relapse, but surprisingly I didnt and it made me feel much better. 

I really like this thread as I get to read about people and motivate myself. Will hopefully keep posting here.

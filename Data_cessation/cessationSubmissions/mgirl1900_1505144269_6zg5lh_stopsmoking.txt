22 Days and feeling proud :))) WORRIED about nrt though !

22 Days today for me ...I have been on 14mg patches and want to stop using them ...is it too early ??? I know the program suggests 6-8 weeks but they are so expensive and I really have zero desire to ever smoke again !! Any advice ? Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I stick with the program for another 3-5 weeks?

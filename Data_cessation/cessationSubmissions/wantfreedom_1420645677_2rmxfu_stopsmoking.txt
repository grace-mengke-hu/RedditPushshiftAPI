Another attempt at quitting

Not particularly a new year's resolution since I typically avoid them, but the timing just seemed to match up this year.  This is my fourth day cold turkey and I'm hurting bad.  I've read a few places that urges and cravings pass in 5-10 minutes, but it's been an hour and I'm still hurting.  Luckily, I haven't snapped at anyone, but I can't seem to focus on anything.  It also happens to be a slow day at work.  I did my push ups, I'm chewing gum and I've got my cup of water.  I'm considering grabbing an e-cig or something just to help cope, but I dunno if that's a good idea.

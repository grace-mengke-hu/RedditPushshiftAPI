Today is the day

Today is the first day of me quitting. 

It has been eight hours since my last cigarette and I'm already craving one badly. Only reason I haven't bought a pack is because I don't have enough money. 

What are some ways to quit the cravings?


Last time I quit smoking, I ate a lot more. How do I stop myself from eating too much?

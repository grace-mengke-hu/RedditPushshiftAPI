I've quit today but I need tips for managing stress levels while with kids

Hello r/stopsmoking,

I've been lurking this sub for a while, and finally got myself together enough to go see the Quit Squad who have prescribed me Champix. 

I'm currently on day 11, and have lost all interest in smoking (As well as nausea, and crazy dreams, but no sever mental health issues thank god) so I have cut right the way back yesterday and today. From right now I plan to chuck the fags for good. 

Tonight was really tough, I have 2 very small children (3 and 11 months, managed to switch to ecig with both of them whilst pregnant, then once they arrived I ended up back on the fags) and my youngest decided to fight sleep for nearly 2 hours come bedtime. I managed to get through the first hour, whilst juggling the toddler and fighting cravings. But then I just lost it, put the crying baby in her playpen, stuck the toddler in front of YouTube and went for a fag. Turns out it was a positive because it's made me certain I never want to smoke again. 

My problem is, I need to be able to calm and distract myself without a cig, whilst caring for my kids. My husband works alot so often it's just me at home with them. So I can't just go out and walk off my cravings, or loose myself in crafts/writing/other hobbies as my small kids need me all the time. And sometimes, though I love them both to bits, they are the main cause of my stress. 

So if anyone has any good tips or routines that have helped them, or any advice in general, I would massively appreciate it. 

And thank you to everyone in this sub for the inspiration for me to go and get help quitting. Constantly seeing people celebrating victories and supporting each other has been a huge motivator and you should all be damn proud of yourselves, no matter where you are in the quitting process!

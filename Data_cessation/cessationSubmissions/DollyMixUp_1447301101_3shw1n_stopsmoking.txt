2 Months 2 weeks - still using Lozenges

Baring in mind I've had 3 slip ups during this time.

It's proving very difficult to get off nicotine replacement lozenges. 
I'm on the lowest strength now but using more than the recommended every day. 

I need to start cutting down, making note of how many I'm using.

Has anyone had this issue?
I'm wondering if it's worth speaking to a Doctor or pharmacy about it (I'm in the UK the pharmacy runs a Stop Smoking service)

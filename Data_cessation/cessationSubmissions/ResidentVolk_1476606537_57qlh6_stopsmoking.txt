Day 2... I'm gonna get fat :(

Damnit, I hate smoking.
I never liked it, it was a stupid habit I picked up from rolling marijuana with tobacco... Some 4 years ago I quit Marijuana for a year, ciggerates soon followed.
But then I gained weight, like serious weight... 10-15kilos in 7 months.

I think in part my decision to start smoking again was because of that, I just kinda said fuck it and went for it... Got my weight under control very fast.

Well I quit Marijuana again last month, and again the craving to stop ciggerates followed up (they're linked for me I guess...) I'm on my second day smoke free, and as soon as I put some food in my mouth I cant stop.
My sweet tooth is back, I can't control myself and last night I ate around 10-15 cookies... Now I'm panicking and starving myself.

;-;

Why is smoking such a good weight control? :/
Bla bla I'm just ranting.

Day 1 completed.

I've been smoking cigarettes for just a little over 10 years.  I don't smoke everyday, but I will go through a pack when I'm out socializing or pulling all-nighters.  After smoking my last pack the other night and feeling like shit afterwards, I realized I need to really quit. I've said this so many times, especially when I go through days, even a week, without smoking. It's not because I don't crave nicotine on a daily basis, it's mostly because I'm too lazy to stand outside or I just forget to smoke.  And then I go out and drink, and the next thing I know I've smoked half a pack in 2-3 hours.  This time, I'm serious.

I'm on day 2 now of not smoking.  Usually this would just come easy for me with very minimal cravings, but actually knowing that I plan on not smoking in the future at all makes it more difficult. Especially with finals approaching, I need to remember to not give in. 

So, here's to hoping I can learn to socialize and drink copious amounts of coffee without having a smoke.

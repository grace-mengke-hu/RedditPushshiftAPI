I messed up, but all I can think about is quitting.

I was smoke free for almost 4 days, and then got into an argument with my S/O and immediately reached for the only thing that I wanted at that moment....a cigarette. Iâ€™ve been smoking pretty heavily for the last week but quitting has been on my mind a lot more than it ever has. I smoked my last cigarette last night and instead of rushing to the store to get another pack so I would have some in the morning, I just went to sleep. 10 hours down. So far so good. I think the key for me is keeping myself busy.

Lasted so long, yet shits coming up

So hit 104 days smoke free, but i have a couple music festivals coming up. Now when you take substances cigarettes feel fucking amazing. My mates who dont normally smoke, can down a deck easily at raves. I've been notorious for being a chimney at these events, only reason i've lasted this long is no events for 104 days. Fucking laters

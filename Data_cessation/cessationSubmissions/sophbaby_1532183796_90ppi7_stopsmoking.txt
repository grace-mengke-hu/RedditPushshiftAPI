2 days, 6 hours, and 50 minutes

I’ve tried to quit every week for the past year with little to no success. After speaking to one of my co workers who just celebrated 100 days smoke free and hearing about how much better she felt, the money she was saving, I felt SO jealous. 

Then I realised I had no reason to feel jealous and I could do exactly the same thing. So I smoked a last cigarette, gave my half full pack to my boss (couldn’t bring myself to throw it in the bin so thought I’d gift it on) and I’ve gone cold turkey! Day one was actually a breeze, I felt incredibly self righteous and proud of myself. I think the fact I was at work was a good distraction too. 

Towards the end of the day I was starting to get a little fuzzy headed but nothing unbearable. Today, was bloody difficult. Only had a few fairly short lived cravings that I ignored and they passed quickly but the MOOD SWINGS. I spent the entire morning literally vibrating with rage. Every second word was ‘fuck’ and I honestly think I would have punched someone in the throat if they looked at me wrong. 

The afternoon, I spent trying not to burst into tears for absolutely no reason. My cat jumped on me and poked a tiny hole in my cardigan and I WEPT. Despite being a bit of an emotional wreck though I’m feeling very strong and not once seriously considered going and buying smokes. This time, it truly feels like I’m free and things will be worth it! I’ve been browsing this sub for the past 3 hours and it’s so inspiring seeing people’s progress and knowing I’m not alone. So, thanks!

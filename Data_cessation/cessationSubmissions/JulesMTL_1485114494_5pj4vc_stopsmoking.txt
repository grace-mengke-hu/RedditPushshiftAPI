5,5 years later, it's time to move on.

Hey guys, I've finally decided to quit smoking. I've been a regular smoker for about 5,5 years now and I can't take it anymore.

I started smoking while backpacking through South East Asia in 2011. I was 19 back then and it seemed like every goddamn backpacker smokes. There was a lot of drinking involved and I tried my first cigarette and was instantly hooked. I've made a few attempts to quit over the years, my longest being 2 months, but it always felt like I had an excuse to pick up the habit again. Whatever it was, stress, bad day at work, night out with friends, there was always a reason to start smoking again.

I'm always out of breath, my face is dry and my chest feels constantly tight. According to my calculations, I've spent roughly 12k on cigarettes (which is exactly what I spent on my 1 year trip around the world, fucking ridiculous). I've tried to convince myself I would stop at 25 (in 3 months) or when I have kids. I'm sick of putting a deadline on my health and happiness. Sick of the guilt, sick of the fact that I smoke 15 cigarettes a day but haven't enjoyed even one of them for the past year, sick of giving so much symbolism to a worthless piece of tobacco.

I'm going cold turkey. I know I'll be unbearable for the next few weeks, but fuck this shit, I'm through.

Stepping down the patches today

It's not ideal timing as I've had more cravings since starting back at work following my holiday, because of the stress. But I've already had 2 more weeks of 25mg than I should because I didn't want to step down during my holiday - I thought it was going to be hard enough without adding that!

Anyway - I'm happy to be stepping down, from memory from previous quits it's hardly noticeable so fingers crossed I won't suffer too much this weekend. 

Happy weekend everyone, you're awesome!

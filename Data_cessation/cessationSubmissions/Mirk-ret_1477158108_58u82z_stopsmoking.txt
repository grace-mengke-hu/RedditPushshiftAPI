Four weeks - this has been easier than I thought

I smoked for about 17 years. I tried to quit about 10 years ago, and that didn't work out at all. After that I haven't even really thought about quitting, I just thought I wouldn't have the motivation and disclipine to do it. I thought I was too addicted and too weak. 

Six weeks ago I decided to try. Like really try, and get rid of all my smokes and lighters and telling everyone about it. I had a few relapses, but after I quit drinking 24 days ago I haven't even had that many cravings.

This is really weird. I didn't think I had it in me, but now it seems like I have quit smoking.

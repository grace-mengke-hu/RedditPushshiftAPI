Need your help.

TL;DR - How do you guys stay motivated? I'm struggling. Logically I know the facts and it all makes sense to not smoke. But addiction isn't based on logic. The people around me won't motivate me so I've come to you guys :)

Ok, so I challenged myself to do a no cigarette Feb because, if I know my psychology - I will be horrified at the thought of starting again after a month. I'm 9 days in and that momentum is already what is keeping me strong. My entire family smokes and so does the majority of my friendship group - I'm home atm, with nothing to do and I'm trying really hard but I need some motivation and support. As much as I know my family and friends support me - the support of people who are still smoking is always restrained because they don't want to focus on the fact that they are still smoking. So it's pretty quiet on the motivation front right now. I understand on an intellectual level everything that is going on in my mind right now but because addiction isn't an intellectual *decision* - I need emotional motivation to stay strong.

Your standards are a direct reflection of the expectations of your peers. And right now, (I love them, *but*) I'm trying to have better standards than my peers. So I figured it would make sense to come to you guys for help seeing as you understand. Any tips?

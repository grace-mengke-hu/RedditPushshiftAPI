hard time trying to quit smoking

Hey guys, I've been smoking for nearly 2 years now and it's my third week I've quit smoking. It's getting quite hard, I'm battling cravings with soft drinks/sugar/junk food. I'm not sure if that's ideal, It's getting really hard now, my brain isn't addicted to it, it maybe is. I just want to give up with everything and start smoking again, it's a psychological urge that never leaves me. I don't know what would help, any ideas?

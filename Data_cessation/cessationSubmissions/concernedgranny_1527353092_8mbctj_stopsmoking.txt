Quitting with mental illness

I’ve been smoking cigarettes for 10 years now and I’m finally done... I’m just so tired of being a slave to nicotine. I guess a little backsory:

 I began smoking as a teenager (weed and cigs) and I was able to quit 6 years ago when I became pregnant with my daughter.
I picked up smoking cigs again after she was weaned from breastfeeding and it was a horrible mistake. 

I smoke cigarettes at work, and this is disgusting but I also smoke tobacco out of a bong in the evening on my porch (kinda like relaxing with a glass of wine I guess?) and thats where the majority of my nicotine addiction lies... taking a huge hit and feeling the buzz and being able to relax and all your worries disappear... until I need to smoke again. It’s so awful and I seriously hate myself for it. My daughter could find out any day about my addiction and it would be heartbreaking. 

Thankfully my fiance had to quit smoking cold turkey suddenly due to a health scare, and he is already 15 days smoke free. He has been a huge inspiration for me- just seeing for myself how much more funny ll of life he is already has been motivating me that it’s possible. I’m so proud of him! 

I feel so ready, I have made a plan for myself and have been preparing mentally- but I’m so scared of the mental effects of withdrawals .. I have major depressive disorder and I’m worried about setting myself back.. or feeling suicidal and having bad thoughts, and being a horrible person to be around while I get back to normal. Whatever that might be, I forget what it feels like to not smoke.. and I am excited to feel that again.

Anyways tonight is my quit date- I work until late into the evening (not bringing any cigs to work today!) and I have a tiny bit of tobacco left for a last smoke out of my bong, then it’s going right into the garbage. Tomorrow the challenge really begins though. I’m glad I found this sub.

Whats wrong with me...6 Month in, still huge cravings!

its been 6 month since i quit cold turkey. Still, i have huge cravings. twice or more every day. I mean i know i wont smoke again, because the benefits are to great but its exhausting for every cell of my body. I cant think straight, iam always sleepy and cant work efficiently.

Is it maybe something else? I do alot of exercising. (Running and biking) I had my blood checked. everything was fine.

Thanks for your huge support. Everyday iam here. :)

Help me, please

Quit for over a year, started up again about 6 months ago now. I really want to quit again. Last time I quit I used motivation from reading this sub and a stop smoking h app. I don't know how to do it again. The temptation is too real. Each morning I have that: "right, today I won't touch another cigarette" but as the morning goes on I cave. I don't know how you can help, I just desperately want to quit. I'm 27 now and getting to feel that I'm not immortal etc if you get what I mean.

Thanks for reading

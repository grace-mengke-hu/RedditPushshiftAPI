What happens when you lose your appetite because of Quitter's flu therefore losing weight in a quick and unhealthy way

Quit 2 months ago (yey) and since then have been plagued by the weird side effects (most have passed phewph) however the major recurring one seems to be Quitter's flu which seems to have greatly reduced my appetite (I'm basically forcing myself to try to eat 800-1000 calories daily) and therefore losing weight but not in a healthy manner (I was doing the right things not to gain weight when i first quit but here dropped 2 KG in barely 3 weeks because I'm not very hungry). 

Have others noticed a lack of appetite & what happened once their quitter's flus passed? Did they have to reset their metabolism and did they regain all the weight lost?

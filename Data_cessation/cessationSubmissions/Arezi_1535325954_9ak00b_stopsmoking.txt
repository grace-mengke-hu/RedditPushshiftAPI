How many of you guys got Flu-like symptoms after quitting?

I'm on Day 3 of quitting cigarettes. I've been having a minor throat ache, coughing up mucus, coughing a bit in general, and feeling slightly sluggish. I'm still in-taking nicotine, as I bought a JUUL for myself to help me quit, but haven't touched a single cigarette in 3 days now.

I've read that flu-like symptoms are normal after quitting cigarettes, but I'm curious to know how many of ya'll felt flu-like symptoms such as these after quitting.

Day two... no patience

I can't quite say I have even had more than a handful of cravings, but man am I short tempered and annoyed! Maybe it's a craving, because I've muttered to myself about "might as well just smoke if life sucks so bad"... which it actually doesn't, I'm just in the kind of mood where all things suck and to hell with it all. 

Ugh, I need the next couple days to just go by quickly!

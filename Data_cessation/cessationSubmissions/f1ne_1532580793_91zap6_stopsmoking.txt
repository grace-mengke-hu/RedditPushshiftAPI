Day 5: Today was honestly one of the worst days I’ve had in a very long time. And I didn’t smoke.

Nothing spectacularly bad happened. I woke up late and was 15 minutes late for work, work just fucking sucked, today was the first day I had a lot if physical symptoms from not smoking, I had plans with a friend but I blew him off and now I feel like a total asshole, the gas light in my car turned on on my way to work and my normal route home flooded on my way home, so I had to take a long way home, while almost out of gas, which was really stressful...

Today I realized: I don’t ever want to feel this way again. If I smoke, I’ll eventually have another bad day with smoking withdrawals again. Smoking will lead to another day like today. Smoking will just make me feel worse.

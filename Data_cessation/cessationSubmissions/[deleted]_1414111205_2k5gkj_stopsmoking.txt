Hypnotherapy for the win -- 5 weeks smoke free and thank goodness I never have to do that again.

I posted here quite a while back, my story is I smoked for 20 years, read Alan Carr's book and stopped for 6 years, then forgot the chapter about there's no such thing as just one cigarette.  It was a slow road back to buying smokes again, over 2 years of gradually smoking more here and there, until I finally I started buying them regularly again.

For 18 months I was a full on pack a day closet smoker, my fitness dropped right off, I was berating myself daily, but just kept on smoking.  I read the book again, would stop for 4-5 days, then start again.  Gees, I even did a yoga teacher training smoking every few days.

Then at the end of this last summer I heard about a Hypnotherapist that has a 94% success rate with her 1 session $500 smoking cessation program.  So I made an appointment, and wow, wasn't that easy, I'm still kind of blown away.  3 days later I had a high school reunion with all my original smoking buddies, partied like we were 18 again, and I didn't even have the slightest craving.  I still am not having any kind of with drawl or cravings, haven't been eating more than I should, just busy feeling great.

Best $500 I've ever spent, had to share.  Now I'm trying to come up with some other good ideas for her to plant in my subconscious. 

Also I'm grateful to have had this sub to lurk around, so thanks for that, and good luck to the other lurkers :) 

EDIT: [Here's](http://www.seasidehypnosis.com/) who I called if anyone is keen and in this area.

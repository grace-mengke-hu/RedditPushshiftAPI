Just found y'all, 10 days cigarette free today!

I am part of a quit smoking community on fb and it has helped me immensely, so I figured I'd find one here too.  I am using the patch, step 1, I'm knitting like a crazy person, and am using peppermints and jolly ranchers to help me through all this.  Just wanted to say hi, and share that I'm celebrating my double digits today!  :)

I think I accidentally quit smoking.

Hey everyone. I've been an occasional smoker since I was 15, up to a pack a day at 18, and about a pack and a half a day from 20 to present day (23). I finally got my first full-time job out of college and work in an office setting.

I wasn't smoking at work because I'm in a probationary period and I wanted to make a great impression, and that meant not smelling like cigarettes everywhere I went. However, I've never worked a full-time job before, so I was exhausted. I'd go straight home and sleep.

So I don't even know when I smoked my last cigarette. Today marks 3 weeks of when I realized I wasn't smoking. And I feel great. I went out for beers with a few friends on Saturday and I didn't have one smoke. They couldn't believe it. I would smoke at least 2 cigarettes every time we stepped out of the bar. Not this time!

So I guess that's me "accidentally" quitting smoking. And I feel great!

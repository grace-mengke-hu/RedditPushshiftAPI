Three days in, feeling a bit empty.

I decided 2017 would be "my year" corny, right? Yeah, I know every does that at the beginning of every year, but I've dealt with an illness for the past 8 years and this is the first time since then that I've been 100%. I've been going to the gym, eating right. I've been told that I have an addictive personality, so deciding to finally quit smoking after four years has really left me with a void in my daily life, especially while driving. As soon as the car door shut I was lighting up. What did you do to fill that gap or did you just ignore it? Any advice is welcome.

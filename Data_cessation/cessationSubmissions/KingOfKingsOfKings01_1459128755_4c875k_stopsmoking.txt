Such a bad night/morning.

Spent the end of the night in pain waiting on ambulance..pacing up and down my street in a terrible deep stomach pain... didnt crack and have a smoke

then continued to lay in ER for many many hours..sleep deprived..stabbed numerous times with needles..

soon as i got out.. i managed to bum a cigg

didnt smoke it..

i held it and walked 2kms trying to get closer to home before i got a taxi so i could actually afford the lift

finally reached a point closer enough to get a taxi..

soon as i got home.. had a cigg

1 cigg for today isnt so bad is it ? 0 ciggs tomorrow!

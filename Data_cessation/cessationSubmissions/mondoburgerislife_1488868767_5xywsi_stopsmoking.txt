Progress, I guess?

Today after almost 6 weeks I broke. I begged my friend to give me a cigarette, promised them I really wanted it. After the first puff it tasted utterly disgusting and I gave it to someone who walked up to the smoking area. I'm frustrated with myself for breaking after this progress, but I guess it's good to know the cravings aren't as real as I thought.

Despite my setback I feel more motivated!

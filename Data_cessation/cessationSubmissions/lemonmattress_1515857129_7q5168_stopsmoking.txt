2 weeks in, I couldn't smoke while I had the flu.. so I used that as an excuse to quit :D

I would actually highly recommend this method to anyone out there wanting to quit.. the only downside is you can get "smoker's flu" and it basically turns into a double strength flu (which is what happened to me) but once it's over you feel amazing.

I already feel a lot more "human" more connected to stuff I do and my reaction times feel a bit better. I feel a lot cleaner too.

WTF am I doing.

Hey guys. Long time lurker, long time justifier, first time badge requester.
I've always told people I would quit cold turkey when I was ready. And up until a few weeks ago I really think there was still a part of me that wanted to keep smoking cigs. But, honestly, this gap between me wanting to smoke cigarettes and quitting them has kind of involved a lot of denial on my part. I think I was scared to face the fact that I might fail. I regard my mind as my biggest asset, and I'm scared that there's a chance I won't be able to control it. 
Intellect and willpower are two very different things, however. Time I start realizing that and working to bring the latter up to the former's level. 
**Holy shit, this is hard.** first time I've ever actually slapped myself on the wrist and told myself no. I need to work on impulse control and this seems like a good rite of passage. I really want to go to a meditative retreat this summer.. and I can't tell you how useless I would feel sitting there craving during my long sessions of silence. Depending on chemicals isn't healthy, duh. I just have to say no every time I crave nicotine. The concept is simple. I'm only a couple hours in though. And I'm scared of this morning. And I'm scared of telling myself with 100% surity that I won't smoke. Even though I have the capacity. 

That badge is not resetting once.

Keep on keepin on, guys.

P.S. Quit smoking weed two days ago as well.. hope I'm not taking on more than I can handle, which people are constantly advising against over at /r/getdisciplined, but I can't keep being a victim to my impulse. I have smoked every single day, and I really mean that, for probably 7 years by now (except germany). My **poor lungs**

edit: I think I put the wrong year in for badgebot or whatnot. It should be on its way to getting fixed, but so far nothing. If a mod sees this, could they put me down to the 21st?

For the first time, i'm disgusted by smoking

Just like the rest of the planet, I decided to make my new years resolution to quit smoking, for like the 3rd year in a row.

This year I did something a bit different. I hypnotized myself with a youtube video. I also experimented with LSD to try and change my mindset towards smoking. Well, something clicked, and for the first time in my life, i'm actually disgusted by smoking. I have always gone a couple days without smoking with the STRONGEST cravings, but this time I have absolutely no cravings. I mean, yes I have, but thinking about the damage I would do makes me say no.

Today is day 3 going cold turkey, and I feel great. My eggs that I ate for breakfasted tasted amazing, and I didn't wake up with a sore throat.

Last night, I went to join some friends for a couple beers. I was worried I would cave if I was drinking. My friend offered me a smoke, and I said no (which felt amazing). When they came back inside, they smelled AWFUL, I have never smelled this on people until now.

I feel clean for once. My acne has already gone down, breath better, overall I just feel better!

I will now be training to run a 15 mile race this March.

For all those out there, quit and never look back! IT FEELS FUCKING AMAZING. And if possible, get your hands on some LSD and tell yourself smoking doesn't have control over you. And youtube search stop smoking hypnosis videos and take them seriously.

Good luck squad

1 cigarette the last 3 days.

This is tough, but I'm forcing my way through. One thing that worries me is the temptation to have one tomorrow, or next weekend, or next month. I have lots of NRT (gum) but how much nicotine am I getting, I'm worried about getting more nicotine now than before. I have a E-cigarette but am thinking of getting a vaping device just have no idea which one. Just so many questions.

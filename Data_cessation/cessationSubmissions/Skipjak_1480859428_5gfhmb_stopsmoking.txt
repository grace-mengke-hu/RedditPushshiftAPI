That one thing you hate the most about smoking

To further motivate us quitters, maybe it's a good idea to think about the things we really hate about smoking.

I smoked rollies myself, resulting in tiny fucking tobacco crumbs EVERYWHERE, like the pockets in my clothes, my backpack, on the floor. God I hated that. 8 days smoke free and not missing this shit one bit.

What about you guys?

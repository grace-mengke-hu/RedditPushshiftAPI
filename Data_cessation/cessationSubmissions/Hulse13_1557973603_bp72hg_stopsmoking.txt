Making it through

Been using patch 21mg for 2 weeks and yesterday was on my last one before I went to 14mg. For some reason I was extremely emotional starting my day off, ugly crying for no reason and hated everything/everyone and cracked a beer at 10am (I work from home) to ease whatever the hell emotional feeling. At around 3pm I went to feel my back where the patch was to see how it was doing. IT WASN'T THERE. The damn thing fell off in my sleep the night before! Hence why I was a homicidal emotional mess. Put on my 14mg pass and was good as gold! Here's to 12 plus days not smoking a pack a day for over 20 years, CHEERS!!

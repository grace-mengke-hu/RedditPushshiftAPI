Freedom While Flying

Only here would anyone understand, but not having the fear of dealing with withdrawal after getting one last one(two, three) in and then bag check, waiting, sec checks, getting to the gate, waiting, onto the plane, waiting, the 11/hr flight, waiting, getting your bags, getting to the actual destination... And its the weirdest feeling, something I haven't felt in 14 years, something its been so long that's seemingly such a simple thing, but not having to feed the addiction, not feeling trapped... Its the weirdest thing.  For everyone reading this while slugging their way through day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5, day 6 , day 7... I swear to shit its worth it.  Every moment by moment of succubus of pain you're suffering through, stay the course, you'll find its worth everything for getting the rest of your life back.

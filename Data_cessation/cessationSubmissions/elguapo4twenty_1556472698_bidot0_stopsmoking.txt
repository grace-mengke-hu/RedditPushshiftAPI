2 years Nicotine free after 14 years of smoking/dipping!

I would of never of thought that quitting smoking would be so easy doing the cold Turkey method. I always thought that if I didn't have nicotine I would be so stressed out and frustrated all the time. Well unfortunately I still get stressed out and frustrated but now when I do there is no physical urge to escape outside to feed the nicotine demon and that is amazing! Once I read Allan Carrs book and researched nicotine further the process of quitting was so much easier! Before I would keep the nicotine demon alive by feeding it nicotine gum, patches or dip and once I realized the real enemy is NICOTINE and not smoke then was it possible to defeat the enemy. Know they enemy! Good luck to all new comers and thank you for all who stuck around and helped encourage those struggling !

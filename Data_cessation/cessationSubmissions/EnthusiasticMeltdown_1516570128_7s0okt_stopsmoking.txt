Tried to stop smoking using Allen Carr's book today, failed miserably, feel like shit

So I've been reading Carr's book for a few days. Today I decided to quit smoking using his method. Initially I was doing well but eventually withdrawal was so severe that I literally went out searching for some leftover tobacco in my trash. I was covered in food remnats and other disgusting stuff as I was doing that. Only to feel completely worthless after smoking.

I didn't find Carr's book too enlightening. Most of this stuff I was already aware of. I know that cigarettes don't give me anything. I know they're not pleasurable. I know that I only smoke to avoid withdrawal. I want to quit. I have hundreds of reasons to do so. I'm not "psychologically" addicted in a sense that I have no delusions about cigarettes helping me in any way. So Carr's points were sound but I already knew that before.

As I said - I smoke to avoid withdrawal. That's the only obstacle I have. It's purely physical to me. I literally feel as if someone sat on my chest when I didn't smoke for an hour or so. I can't even concentrate on basic things like cooking meals. Whenever I ingest nicotine or nicotine analogue withdrawal is gone. I'm determined to be completely free from dependence in a month or so. I'm going to use cytisine which worked well in the past (I managed to quit but came back to smoking because of my stupidity a few months later).

Sorry for such a rant. I wanted to share this and frankly to seek validation. :(

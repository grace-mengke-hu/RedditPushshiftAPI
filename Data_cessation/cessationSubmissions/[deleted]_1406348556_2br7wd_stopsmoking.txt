Can significant weight loss cause more intense cravings?

After smoking for over 15 years, I finally quit cold turkey six months ago.  It was tough, but I got thru it.  Lurking here helped quite a bit.

After that success, I was inspired to get healthy in other ways, and have lost quite a bit of weight (more than 50 pounds).  My cravings have gotten horribly strong the last couple of weeks, as bad as the first week, if not worse. It's so bad, I even thought of getting an e-cig.

This might be a stupid question, but could my weight loss have released nicotine back into my system, making my cravings worse?

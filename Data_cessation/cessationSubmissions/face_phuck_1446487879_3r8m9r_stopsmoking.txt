Haven't smoked in over a month now, mountain biked 20 miles yesterday.

That's all really. I wasn't a heavy smoker, pretty on and off and it varied a lot depending on how much I was going out with friends, but I noticed it was taking it's toll. I had a hard time running at all, couldn't go for more than a few miles mountain biking. My body is rekt from the 20 miles I did this past Saturday but I did it, MUCH further than I've ever been able to go while smoking. That was all the assurance I needed, never falling back into the smoking trap again.

Delayed Quitters cough?

It has been roughly 2 months for me since I quit. I have stopped smoking weed for the past month - which I only mention so you can be aware of my habits of inhaling toxins into my lungs. The past week I have developed a cough and have not been sick or, as I mentioned smoking. 

Of course I am going to mention this to my Doctor, but I figured I'd ask y'all about what your experiences have been with quitting and coughing.

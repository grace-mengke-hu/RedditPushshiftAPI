Three weeks of not smoking and I'm already back in BEAST MODE.

*Edit: I really hate the term "Beast Mode" when used as a serious description but I like to say it in jest.* 

Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/MsLwuuc) 

In the interest of full disclosure I should also mention that I had quit for about 3 years.  I was so proud of that, prouder than almost anything I've ever done.  But then the "law school debacle" and an innocent drunken cigarette turned into a full-blown relapse lasting on and off for over a year. Before I knew it, cigarettes had me hook line and sinker... again. 

I have come here every single day since I got my badge.  The motivation I see here is incredible, and a big part of what has gotten me through the beginning stages of withdrawal when I just wanted to give up or alternatively, kill someone. I'm always going to belong to this sub, because I learned the hard way that relapse can be a real danger no matter how above this shit you think you are.

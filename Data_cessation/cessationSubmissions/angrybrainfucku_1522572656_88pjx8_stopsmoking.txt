30 Days No Nicotine at all. What I have learned is that no matter what happens and no matter how/what you feel if you don't smoke a cigarette again you will get better for sure. I'm getting better, still need to be careful and not be over confident.

Thanks Everyone  for this great community where I got motivation and hope by coming across people who have kicked this addiction. 
I can't wait to hit 90 days of nicotine free life and feel like a human again.

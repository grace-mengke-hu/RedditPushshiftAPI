Posty McPosty Pants today...

Yeah I know, I am all over this sub today... but it distracts me, so that's a good thing.

So, I am binge watching House of Card this past week... love the show but man, every time I watch The Underwoods share a cigarette, I tell them (outloud) to knock that off.... in the beginning, watching them *casually* smoke bugged the hell out of me in that I can't be that smoker who only smokes now and then and I was jealous (of a TV show, crazy right?) The weird things I think of and decide to share here. 

Back to you regularly scheduled programming....

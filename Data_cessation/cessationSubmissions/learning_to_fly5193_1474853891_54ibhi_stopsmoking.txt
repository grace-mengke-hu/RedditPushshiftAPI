Starting Over - But this is the last Time.

Stopped by to launch my life as a non-smoker. My badge says 601 days right now, and I remember setting it last time I 'quit' - when i lasted about 3 days. Obviously it didn't work and here I am back at day 1.

I've just finished reading EASYWAY and feel like a brainwashed zombie - but I know he makes sense. The withdrawal pangs aren't that bad when you realise how bad it tastes, smells and makes you feel.

It's 2:30 AM and I have just finished the book, had my final cigarette, washed my ashtray, put my lighters away, put my tobacco and rolling things away (nearly a full pouch so I'm going to gift it rather than throw away Â£16).

 When it is a more sociable hour, I plan to wash the curtains, bleach the walls and clean the carpet to get rid of the lingering smells. It will be so good to have a nice-smelling house again!

I've got this and so have you!

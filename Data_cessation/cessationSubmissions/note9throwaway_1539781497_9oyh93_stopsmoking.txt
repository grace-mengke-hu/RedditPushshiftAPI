Do any of you think the reason you origannily started smoked has a correlation with how difficult it is to quit?

Whether it was a break up, anxiety, to be cool, whatever reasons. I think the reason why you picked up the habit in the first place might make it harder or easier to quit. I started smoking because I went through a bad break up and thought it might ease the pain. I'm now in a healthy relationship and finding it easier to quit than my previous attempts but sure if I went through the same thing again I might pick it up again.

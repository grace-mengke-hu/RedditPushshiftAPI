It's killing her. How do I make her stop?

So my mom is smoking for as long as I can think. She is over 60 now. She has never been a heavy smoker but from what I read during my own process of quitting, that doesn't seem to have a huge impact on the odds of getting lung cancer.

She was always 'hiding' from me that she was smoking. She would never do it in front of me. She would hide in the back of the garden, throw the cigarette away quickly when she would see me coming home from school, etc. 

Now that I stopped myself, it's the first time in my life that I actually realise what she is doing to herself: Her coughing is really bad especially in the morning but actually even sometimes during the day or evening. She is a sports teacher so I guess she's still in a very good shape (maybe that's saving her). 

I recently lost an uncle to cancer and thinking I could lose my mother the same way nearly drives me insane. It's odd how I only started to think about these things after I quit myself. An addicted brain is such a malicious creature...

So anyway I want to ask her to stop - for herself but also for me and my dad. I am just getting scared more and more everyday. The thought that even if she stops right now, her chances of dying from it are still insanely high...

I thought of buying her Carr (I only have it in English and she can't speak/read that) but I actually don't know how to approach it since it's some sort of taboo in our family - we don't speak about smoking (strange, huh?)... 

I don't exactly know why I put this here but... but I guess I am looking and hoping for advice on what to do and how to do it. Maybe some similar experiences? 

TL;DR Mother smokes. How do i get her to stop?

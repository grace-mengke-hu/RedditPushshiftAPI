Smelling...

I'm at Day 21!  I've read a lot of posts about people having their smelling sensations return really strong. Mine haven't. In a way, it's good because nothings been strong enough to induce cravings, and yet not strong enough to make me sick. Any thoughts or stories on smell, when it happens etc???? BTW, smoked 34+ years and at least a pack and a half a day and was actually sick when I stopped smoking.

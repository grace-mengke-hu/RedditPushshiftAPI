I'm doing well, temptation is more an annoyance than anything.

You guys are great! This sub has kept me feeling far more accountable than I have ever felt for quitting before! Also, I have a much different mentality towards it now, which has helped.

I don't see myself as having "quit", I simply decided to make a transition in my life to becoming a "non-smoker".

Again, you guys are the best.

And a seriously gigantic shout-out to pyro5050!!!

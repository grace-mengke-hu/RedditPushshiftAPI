5 days no cigs...Is it normal to be antsy?

Ok, so I haven't smoked and today is day 5. I've been doing the 4mg nicotine gum and I just feel very antsy right now. Like I have to get up and do something NOW. I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this while quitting and what I can do to help calm my nerves a bit. The gum is helping but I just think i need to do something to occupy my time better. This is much harder than I had anticipated lol!


Edit: out of curiousity, what are some peoples opinions on Nicotine replacement therapy and/or Vaping (e-cigs) for temporary cessation assistance.

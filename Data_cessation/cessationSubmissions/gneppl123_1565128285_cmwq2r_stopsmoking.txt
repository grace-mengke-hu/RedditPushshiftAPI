7 hours into my journey!

I've been a pack a day smoker for about 9 years. I'm 25 years old and just recently went in for a yearly checkup and my blood pressure was high. Wake up call. So much sodium in everything, but that's a different post for a different sub. I knew right away I have to figure out how to quit.

I'm halfway thru Allen Carr's novel and it's absolutely helping. So, at work today, I had a 3 hour meeting. At the end of the meeting I thought, why not use this time to just stop? I haven't gone more than 2 hours without a smoke since I started. I did just that, now here I am. 7 hours in. Cranberry juice in the fridge and gum on hand. Honestly, I feel fine. No major cravings, I'm snackin on some baby carrots, just keeping busy.

Questions for any and all of you...

I downloaded the smoke free app, it's awesome! It says I have roughly 1 day and 17 hours until a majority of the nicotine withdrawals are complete. Does that sound right? Like the first 3 days are the worst? I'm really nervous for days two and three because I still have work through the week. I really hope being 7 hours in KIND OF gives me a glimpse as to what day 2 and 3 will be like? I know it's different from person to person, but right now I feel fine. Any thoughts?

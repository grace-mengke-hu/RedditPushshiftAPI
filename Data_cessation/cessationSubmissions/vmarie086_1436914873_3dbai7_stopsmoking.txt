Suggestions please?

I definitely feel like there should be a wiki here! 

I am 25 and work a pretty stressful job(at least to me). I started smoking at 18 pretty much. Of course I didn't smoke everyday off the bat, but a black and mild here and there. I wouldn't dare smoke those nowadays but I am up to maybe 3/4 of a pack on a normal day.I also have 1 year old so I can find plenty of "reasons" I need to pick up yet another pack of cigarettes everyday.

I am sure I have the same cravings most others have here. My commute can be measured by the amount of cigarettes I can smoke... 1.5 btw. After then it's another for my first break of the day, lunch of course, and second break. More on the way home. And I don't even know if I will like drinking anymore if I stop smoking.

But I need to and I know this. I want to. I find it RIDICULOUS that we know so much about the bad effects of smoking and smoking near those around us, but as a people we still do it. And I am one of those people... Makes no sense right?

All that to say, what are some suggestions for getting it off my mind? What has worked for you? I can say now that I quit, but come day 2 morning commute and I'm about to stop somewhere for another pack.

**TL;DR** I came here looking for others alternatives to smoking.

As of today, I will do everything in my power to be a non-smoker

Just wanted to say today, I finally got the motivation to stop smoking. It's going to be hard, but I hope I can pull it off.

I'm an athlete. I love working out, and playing soccer, rugby and volleyball. But after having worked in the club/bar industry, smoking just came naturally. I hate having to walk back from soccer with a cigarette in my hand. I hate how it kills my fitness, how it takes money from my wallet, how I smell around others after I smoke and so on.

I quit cold turkey for a month around last year. Then after I went to a party, I smoked with a few friends and next thing you know I was smoking again. I hate having to depend on my best friend nicotine. I want it to be over.

I want to join the ranks of everyone here who has finally gotten rid of their smoking addiction. 

Just wanted to ask two things:
1. What things do you do to keep yourself from smoking?
2. Has any of ex-smoker here been able to become a casual smoker?

Thanks

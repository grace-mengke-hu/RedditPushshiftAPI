Today is Day 1! Several Failed Attempts, but still trying hard to stop smoking

Stopped smoking for a year, but got hooked again. Now, after a year long "on-off relationship" I want to quit more than ever.

I discovered this sub last week and it helped me to get through the first days. After a week of non smoking I relapsed at a party with old friends.
Today, 3 days of smoking later, I'm ready again for a serious attempt.
The week of non smoking was the best in terms of my selfesteem and health in a long time.
Wish me Luck!

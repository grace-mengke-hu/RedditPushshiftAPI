Smoking temptation craving when thinking about join

Hi , I stopped smoking for 3 weeks already , didn t take anything , I m pretty happy with that. Now I m staying with my dad which tend to stress me sometimes and have strong but very short craving ( heart beat fast , heavy breath ) sometimes. I just tell myself it s ok and it will pass.

However in 2 weeks I will go to Amsterdam for a week and I absolutely want to smoke a join ( I haven t done that for years ) . I don t want one with nicotine inside of course so I would have less chance to relapse.

However thinking about getting high tends to generate some craving . I started smoking with join filled with tobacco and never realized before I was addicted to it until I quitted smoking join and then shifted to cigarettes.

Any of you quit smoking any cigarettes but smoking joins without tobacco occasionally without troubles ?

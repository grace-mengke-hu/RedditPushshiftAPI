2 Months Today Smoke Free!

My Mom quit about 6 years ago with Chantix. I was afraid to try it because of all the things they list as possible side effects and the fact that I take antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds but I finally was ready to chance it. It paid off. No bad side effects and I stopped smoking and craving nicotine as much pretty quickly, 9 days into taking it. I still have moments when I want to smoke but if you smoke while taking it you don't get the effects from the nicotine because it blocks the nic receptors. It has been 2 months today and I am on my 3rd month's supply which is the last for most people. I started smoking as a habit at 21 and even when I decided to quit I still admitted that I enjoyed smoking but with the possible health problems and social stigma it  was time to quit and be a better example to my 9 year old grandson. When I wanted to smoke in public like in a parking lot I was ashamed to be seen with a cig. I felt judged even in my dreams of smoking after quitting!. Now I don't feel that way and I'm not the one in the family that has to go outside after eating or just because of the craving to smoke at family functions. Haven't smoked inside in 4 years but now my hair and clothes smell like shampoo and fabric softener like they should and not ashes. It's a journey to stay smoke free not a sprint but I'm looking forward to being able to exercise more and lose weight as I'm one of those that smoking didn't help keep my weight down. Looking to keep up the success and start treating my body better and live a healthier life in many ways. :)

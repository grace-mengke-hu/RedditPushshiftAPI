Mercy... I fucked up.

ok, i effed the eff up.

SUCH a relief to put this down in writing. 

yesterday: i used an e-cig 

i consider this to be a slip,  
because i am trying to go cold turkey. 

i honestly think that for me, it's the best and only way. 

i guess i was a bit hard on myself for using the e-cig  
or something

because today i actually smoked a whole cig. 

in the moment, i had to force back the voice of my conscience screaming at me:  "No! Weak! Stop! What's wrong with you?!"

i said - "fuck you, conscience"

and now i am crrrrrraving so hard! so wanting to smoke until my voice is just pure rasp, and i am coughing with a feeling like death is residing just a little bit in there. i used to like that feeling- in *the most* absurd way possible. Now, I am just going to have to sit with that craving, and start over. i guess i will have to re-start my badge as well (tear!! failure stings) 

Here is my starting-over rally cry:

I refuse to approach life/death and the basis of my existence in this naive way. I refuse to deny that cigs=cancer. I want to return to the sane version of thinking, which thoroughly detested the presence of a cig, and did not romantacize it over pure logic. 

and to my conscience: you were right! you were totally there for me today, but i ignored you! it was not the right decision, just the one smoke. the one smoke tasted so bad, too! i did not even feel a buzz because i was too worked up about the fact that i was smoking. i will listen to you more closely from now on!! it takes time and patience, but in the end...

my lungs will be pink, PINK, goddammit!

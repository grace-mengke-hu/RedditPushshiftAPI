E-cig addiction

So I switched to an E-cig over a year ago, and it obliterated my desire to smoke cigarettes. HOWEVER. It has caused me to become so addicted to nicotine, more so than I ever was addicted to the cigarettes. The fact you can smoke it indoors has really done me in. Instead of using it in place of having 2-3 cigarettes a day, I quickly began using it around the clock. And now, i'm worried for my health.

I went to the doctor yesterday inquiring about some chest pains i've been experiencing. Currently awaiting results from my chest x-rays. I've got to put the stupid vape stick down. Whether the pains are from the e-cig, or otherwise. I feel like i'm glued to this thing. 

I bought several bags of sunflower seeds, they're one of my favorite snacks, and I realized they keep me from using the e-cig every 5 minutes. I know I need to just throw out all my e-cig stuff, but i'm scared. I quit drugs, alcohol, and sugar. But this one. This is my last vice. I'm scared to let it go. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm scared i'm going to go completely nuts without the e-cig.

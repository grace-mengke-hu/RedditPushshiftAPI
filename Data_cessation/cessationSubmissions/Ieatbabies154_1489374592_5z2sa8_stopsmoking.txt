Reporting in at 18 days 8 hours and 42 minutes, from unseasonably cold NJ, with a blizzard incoming, and feeling so lucky I won't have to constantly bundle up every hour.

Smoking is a chore all around, no matter what way you look at it, but when its cold out it just becomes miserable. Tough to remember why I was so devoted I'd go out every single day. 

To any newcomers reading this, while different methods work for different people, my method was cold turkey, I have cravings rarely at this point, and they just aren't tough to shrug off. The first three days FOR ME weren't half as tough as others made it out to be, definitely took discipline though. It is a never ending craving for sure, but it just keeps getting easier each day.

Almost a month

Hi everyone,
I wanted to say thank you so much to everyone posting here, it has really helped me while I quit and it’s such a pleasure to find such a positive place online for people quitting! 
I’ve stopped physical cravings I think, now it is when I am low or anxious or stressed. Quitting smoking is making me realise the different ways I try to stifle these emotions rather than just face them. And I guess how little value I placed on my health and my self esteem when I smoked a pack a day even when I hated it. Cigarettes really are the worst, they made me feel so ashamed and exhausted! 
I think lots of people are at around the same stage as me (I quit a couple days before NYE) so congratulations you guys!! 
Lots of people are starting out and I just wanted to give you some encouragement. After a short period which isn’t the best, you will have about twice the amount of physical energy you had before. You will start to get some self esteem back as you prove to yourself that you can take control of the addiction. Your lungs will loosen up and feel open, like you are actually breathing! Your skin will likely brighten up to the point where people comment on it! You won’t have to wash your smoky jacket over and over even though it’s dry clean only! Your family will be so proud of you. 
The withdrawal sucks but hold on to the fact that it will pass. And your brain has some rebalancing to do so don’t be mad at yourself if you are snappy or tearful for a bit. No one close to you cares about that when they know that you’re quitting, this is so much more important! 
Best of luck to everyone and congratulations at whatever stage you are at. I’m hoping to do something really special for myself when I get to one year free

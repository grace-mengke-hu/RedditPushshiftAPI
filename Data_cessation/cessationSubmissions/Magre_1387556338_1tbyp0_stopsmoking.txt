5 Days In

I am on day 5 with no cigarettes! Months of lurking this thread have definitely helped this pack-a-day guy throw it out. But I am finding that my cravings are worst right before falling asleep and right after waking up. I bought nicotine gum and patches and have had great success with the gum, only chewing 4-6 pieces a day. But I have stopped using the patches due to numbness and extreme irritability. Last night I used one before bed and had terrible nightmares, causing me to wake up every hour or so. Obviously I'm staying the hell aware from those. But right now I'm between waking up multiple times for nicotine cravings or nightmares which are equally as bad.

Gum- 2mg
Patch- 14mg

Question/tl;dr: what is a good way to curb cravings before bed and after waking up not involving the patch?

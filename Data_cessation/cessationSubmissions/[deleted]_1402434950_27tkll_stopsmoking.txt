Day 54 ... having more intense cravings

Today was a very stressful day and I had intense cravings. About as intense like I had when I first quit. I think part of it is because I'm a little less vigilant than when I firs started. I have to stay aware and watch out for those waves of cravings.

Also, I'm nervous. The initial reason I quit smoking is so I can get bariatric surgery. They wouldn't do it without my stopping. Of course, I have the desire to remain smoke and nicotine free even after the surgery. And, I think I'm having doubts and fear about the surgery so that might be a reason for the more intense cravings.

Anyway... I'm still smoke free!

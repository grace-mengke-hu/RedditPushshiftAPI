Today is a Good Day!!

This is the longest I have went without smoking (78 days)!...I'm feeling pretty good and I'm really glad I decided to give quitting a second shot--my first time was back in 2012 and I think I got to about 64 days before I let my life problems at that time get to me...Never again!! Happy Friday Everybody!!

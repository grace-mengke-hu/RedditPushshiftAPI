I turn 30 tomorrow..

This will be my first birthday in many years that I am a non-smoker. I have really turned my life around in the last month. I have been working out regularly and sharing my experience with my 15 year old brother. I would like to thank you all for your encouraging posts and follies. I am excited to see what the next chapter in my book of life has in store for me now that I firmly grasp the pen.

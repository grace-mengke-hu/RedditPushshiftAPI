Day 5

I have smoked for 10 years. I have quit 3 times before with the patches. But now I have a 1 year old daughter and I quit cold turkey last Wednesday. My lungs felt so disgusting, and even though I loved cigarettes, I knew something needed to change. I can't have my little girl thinking that loud coughing in the mornings is normal. She started imitating my coughs, and I hate it! Anyway, a friend suggested using black pepper essential oil so every time I want a cigarette, I step outside, sit in my chair and take deep breaths as if I'm inhaling a cigarette and instead I smell the essential oil and strangely it has kept me from lighting up. Just going through the motions helps with a craving. I figure once the cravings stop hitting me so hard I will be able to stop going outside. Maybe I'll start doing yoga and deep breathing inside instead. Today is day 5 cold turkey and the LAST time I will ever quit! Not one more puff, no matter what!!!

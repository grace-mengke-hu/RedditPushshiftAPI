Quitting yet again.

Third time is the charm, right?  
I have 2 more cigarettes left. As soon as they are gone, I'm done.  Again.
I know it's worth it. I know I felt like a million bucks (most of the time) when I quit before.  I'm tired of being controlled by something that is killing me and wasting my money.

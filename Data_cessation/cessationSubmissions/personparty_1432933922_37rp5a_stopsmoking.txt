Never too Early to quit

I think it's inspiring to see so many people on this sub quit after decades of smoking, improving their health even after so long. It's never too late. 

However!! If you are lurking on this sub or thinking about quitting, but you think "Well I'm just a casual smoker, I only smoke at parties" or "I haven't been smoking very long, I'll quit in a couple years, I want to enjoy my youth" YOU SHOULD QUIT, NO EXCUSES! These were my excuses for not quitting, even though I knew I wanted to quit from the moment I started. 

I was only a smoker for about a year and a half, but even in that brief time, I knew it was doing bad things to my body immediately, and that if I didn't quit I could end up as a 20, 30, 40 year smoker. After a year of smoking I was coming close to a pack a day! Quitting as a short term or casual smoker is no walk in the park, don't trick yourself into thinking that you'll quit when you're "really addicted."

I've been smoke free for about a month and I seriously admire people who are quitting after years and years because it's challenging for me, I can't imagine reversing routines and triggers that have been ingrained for years.

you are the one in charge over your life - so quit smoking and continue to take good care of yourself!!!!

Quit smoking, it's about the worst thing you can do to yourself. Take into account other people's needs, sure, if you like, but genuinely quit because you want to take good care of yourself first. love yourself, and you can love others better too. if you don't want to leave anyone behind because of some bad disease that you can get because of smoking, sure, that's a great motivation, but don't be so bad on yourself first by destroying your endurance, wasting your money, living the life of an addict and endangering your life.

It's very understandable that you did it, we are all susceptible to the nicotine. But many millions have quit, and so can you.

So, quit now, and then move on to the next goals. There's literally thousands of things that you can do to improve your life. Pick something that feels good for you and just start incorporating that into your lifestyle. Just go, this is your chance at life, and you will do fine. Live every day as if it's your last, don't waste any of it, but if you do, forgive yourself and move on ASAP.

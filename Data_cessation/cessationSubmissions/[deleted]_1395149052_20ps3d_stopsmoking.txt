Dear Reddit..

Tonight's the night. I hope. I'm terrified. I'm so scared I won't succeed. I'm so terrified I'm just saying these words and kidding myself. I'm anxious, anxious, anxious I'm going to let myself and my loved ones down. I'm so mortified at the thought of failing. Wish me luck please my random internet friends... I'm going to need it! I keep saying; it's not a big deal, I hate them, they make me feel like shit, life was so great when I was 12 and didn't have to think about them.... I CAN DO IT... I hope... cross your fingers for me!

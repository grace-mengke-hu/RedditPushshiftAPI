Stopping using EasyWay

I stopped smoking 10 days ago after reading Allen Carr's book, and I can honestly say it has been easy for the most part. I was a smoker for 7 years, smoking about 10 a day. 

The problem is that I am going through a rough time right now (something came up, I didn't anticipate it before I took the decision to smoke my last cigaretter). 

When I get the cravings, most of the times I am genuinely able to tell myself "it's the nicotine monster trying to trick me. I'm glad that I'm purging this monster from my body and mind because I don't wanna be a smoker anymore". However, sometimes, I feel really, really, weak without the cigarette. Thing is, the cigarette was also a way for me to escape an unpleasant social interaction when the anxiety kicks in. Anyone was in the same boat? I know that I made the right decision and I never wanna smoke a cigarette again, however, I am afraid that the thoughts I'm having mean that I'll never be able to dismantle the brainwashing completely.

Feeling Low

I've stopped smoking for 16 days now, I stopped without any nicotine replacement. To say the first few days were torture would be an understatement. But after that It has become easier till now. 

I've found myself feeling quite down in the dumps. Also as if something is missing from me because Ive given up smoking. Was just wondering if any you guys had similar experiences?

First I've read this board a few days ago, it has helped and wish I'd checked it out earlier when I first stopped. 

Thanks guys.

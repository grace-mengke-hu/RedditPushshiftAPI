Day two of being a non-smoker

Extremely excited to be done smoking. I'm so happy nicotine won't have a grip over me anymore. I finished Easyway a few days ago. It's strange, but the book makes everything clear. The only difference for me is I do actually think I'm hungry all the time. Maybe that's because it's 8am and I very well could be hungry, but I think for me the tiny tummy emptyness you get when you focus on your nicotine withdrawal is a mix of my body having a withdrawal and being hungry all the time. Oh well. Maybe that will do away in a few days. Looking forward to the future.

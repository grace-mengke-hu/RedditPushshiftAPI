Obsession About Quitting Smoking

So I'm kind of in a dark place right now. I'm trying to quit smoking everyday, everytime when I'm buying a pack of ciggaretes, I'm thinking "okay, this one is the last one". And when I say it's over, I'm a non-smoker from now on, I'm lighting up the next ciggarete even faster than I usually would. I've already red Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, many times actually, and I keep reading it because 7 years ago I was a non-smoker for a 3 months thanks to this book. Yesterday I finnished The Only Way To Stop Smoking Permanently also by Allen Carr, and I'm still a smoker, I don't think this stuff is still working. People keep telling me that I don't really want to, oh but I do. I have some health problems right now and still I'm smoking. I don't get it and I don't know what to do, I've tried every possible method to quit smoking, and yet I'm still a smoker. Every time I quiting, my brain finds a way to convince me to smoke and I keep changing my decidions. 

But for real, I keep trying to quit everyday, I'm obsessed about it. Maybe someone was in a similar place, what your story, what did you do to  find a way out?

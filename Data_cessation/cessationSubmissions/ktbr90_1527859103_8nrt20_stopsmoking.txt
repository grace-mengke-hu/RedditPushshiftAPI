Not easy, but I manage so far

So last night I narrowly escaped a cig drunk, today I dodged a super hard situation. Staying by my parents for 1,5weeks, kind of vacation, old friends etc. Today my brother asked if I come with him for a smoke, said no. Another battle awaits tonight with my old buddies, but I'm determined. 2 hours till 5 whole days. Just had to write this out. Wish you success and strength my fellow quitters.

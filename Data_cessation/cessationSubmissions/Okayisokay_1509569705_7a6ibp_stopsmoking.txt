vent post- my SO offered me a cig TWICE yesterday.

last weekend I fucked up and smoked a cigar, so I guess that means I should reset my badge ? : (( . I hate cigars and have no rational for what I did other than I was drinking and man the service industry sucks. 



And the second part, yeah wtf. It was late night halloween but imo being drunk is still shitty and not an excuse. I didn't say anything the first time they offered, just gave them the look of 'just about had enough of your shit' The second time I told them how hurtful it is that I'm not getting their support. They didn't say much, I probably won't bring it up again with them. ugh. 

Also the same day my SO's grandma handed me a pack I had left at her house after telling her multiple times that they could just be thrown away or put in her OH SHIT bag. She quit about ten years ago but made me personally throw the pack away.

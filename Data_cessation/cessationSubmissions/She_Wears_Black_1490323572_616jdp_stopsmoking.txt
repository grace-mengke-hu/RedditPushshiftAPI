Quit smoking and no changes. Is it just too soon?

I've been smoking a pack a day for 20 years. I've also been running several miles a day for 15 years, never had a smoker's cough, and have always had a very strong sense of taste/smell. I've only quit two weeks ago and I'm sure things are repairing that I'm not aware of. I just can't help but feel dissapointed that nothing is different. I'm not even sure what I'm expecting to change. Anyone else have a similar experience? Thanks!

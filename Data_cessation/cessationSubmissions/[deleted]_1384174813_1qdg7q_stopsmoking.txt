How do you deal with smokers?

Hey.

I'm off cigs for 11 days now, and going strong, but I'm having problems with two smokers that I live with. No matter what I do or say, they still smoke in the kitchen regardless of the fact that I no longer smoke.

I find it to be irritating, selfish and just down right insensitive after the talk that we had about it. Why should I have to constantly be exposed to that? What's the problem with just standing at the back door and having a cig? Is it really that difficult?

Does anyone understand this, or had a similar experience? My tempers just about to break. It's really getting to me.

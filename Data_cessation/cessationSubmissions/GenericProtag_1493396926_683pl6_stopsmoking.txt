Health risks?

Hey so I recently stopped smoking after smoking 5 packs over a few months amd then another 3 over two months and decided to stop. I know it sounds paranoid but I haven't permanently fucked up my body right? Are there any permanent side effects that'll come from having smoked 8 packs before stopping? Just a bit scared.

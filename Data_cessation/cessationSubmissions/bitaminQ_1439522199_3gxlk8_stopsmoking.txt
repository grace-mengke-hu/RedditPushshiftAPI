10 fucking years

10 years ago I finally got it right. 

I quit, for good, forever.

I remember what it was like to be hooked on that bullshit; 1.5 packs a day of full-flavored cowboy killers. They owned me, and they were killing me, and despite numerous attempts, I couldn't quit.

But finally, at 28, I did. 

3 days after I stopped, I remember sitting on a curb outside a drugstore hallucinating because my withdraw was so intense. I remember being in a foul, hateful mood nearly 2 months. I remember cravings, weakness, and remember all the things you may be experiencing right now.

But I won.

You're all here because you want to quit. I'm here to tell you, YOU CAN. It isn't for pansies, but you'll be 10 times the badass once you can say you stared this demon in the face an beat his fucking skull in.

Never would I smoke again. Never do I crave a cigarette. It's idiotic and you know it. Fight your slave masters and stop that shit!

If quitting is your New Years resolution....

Quitting was my New Years resolution last year as it was for about as long as I was smoking and even though it took 4 months for me to stick to it, I'll be coming into the New Year smoke free! 

If it's your New years resolution this year, don't give up on yourself if half way through January you have a setback, try as long as it takes to stick! Keep at it so that next year you won't have to waste another resolution on quitting smoking!  

Happy Holidays Everyone! Be Strong!
(Even if your family makes you wanna chain smoke :P)

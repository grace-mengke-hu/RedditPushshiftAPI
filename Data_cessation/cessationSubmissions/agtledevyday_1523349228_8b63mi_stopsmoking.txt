I’m scared this might become a bigger problem

I don’t know if this is the place to post this. If there’s a specific sub-Reddit for this stuff, let me know.

In less than two weeks, I’ll be done with my freshman year. It was the hardest and most stressful months of my life. I struggled to keep up. I tried getting my hands on some Adderall but that turned out impossible. Since I’m under 19, I couldn’t get cigarettes either. I basically wanted something that could make me focused and motivated when studying. I decided the easiest to get was Nicotine  gum because they’re OTC here in Ontario, Canada. I ignored the “not for non-smokers” label on the packaging. The gum gave me everything I needed and more. Now it’s becoming a problem.

There’s very little I can do without them. I can easily go through 3-5/day of the 4mg ones. They’re effect is decreasing and I get severe headaches without them. I’m very sure I’m addicted to nicotine now, and I’m afraid I might start trying out cigarettes in a couple of months when I hit 19. 

I don’t know what to do. If I stop taking them I might have a harder time than before studying, and if I continue taking them I might start smoking soon.

What should I do?

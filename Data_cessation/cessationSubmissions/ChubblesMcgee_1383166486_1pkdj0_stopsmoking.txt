Supposed to quit soon. I have a few questions.

Ok, so about two months ago, I set a quit date of October 31st. So, what I'm wondering is, should I just go cold turkey, or should I wean off them to make the withdrawal symptoms less severe? I've been a smoker since I was 15, but that was on and off smoking about 3-5 months on 9-7 off. I never had any withdrawal issues except maybe a little drowsiness, but I was never addicted. I started smoking regularly when I got a job at 18, now I'm 20 and I can say for sure I AM addicted now, I'm wondering if it should be easier to go cold turkey since I haven't been addicted as long as some of the people I've seen on the internet or talked to.

Any tips or advice would be appreciated.

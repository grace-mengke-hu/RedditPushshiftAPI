Stay with me

I just smoked after 4 days of not smoking. Got in a stupid argument with my girlfriend (#1 trigger) and smoked 5 in the span of 3 hours. We were quitting together. She’s staying strong. We’ve quit before. I’m usually the one to break. She’s pretty frustrated but still stays supportive. I know it’s up to me to quit and stay quit. I don’t know any of you. I lurk around this sub when I’m thinking about quitting. Please stay with me through this. If you are quitting and want to smoke, just know I’m here with confidence that you won’t. Do the same for me. Post what’s helped you stay quit. How many times before it finally stuck. Thanks all.

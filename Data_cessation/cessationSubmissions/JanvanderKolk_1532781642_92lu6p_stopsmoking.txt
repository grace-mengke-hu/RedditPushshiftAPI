My girlfriend is about to quit smoking. How can I best be there for her?

Hello all,

My girlfriend is finally going to quit smoking. She's been smoking cigarettes for nearly a decade. We're moving house in about a month and a half, and for various reasons now is the best time to do so. In about two weeks, she's going on vacation with family for three weeks. Her plan is to not take any cigarettes with her when leaving, and quitting during a stress-free time over the summer.

I'm very proud of her, and glad that she's finally decided to quit. I'm convinced she'll be able to quit, but I don't want her to have to face this alone. I want to help her in any way I can, but I have no idea how to do so, as I don't know anyone who has quit smoking during my lifetime (or anyone who smokes, for that matter).

If anyone has any advice, it's very much appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

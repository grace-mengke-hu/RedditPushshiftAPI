Infertility, cigarettes... And a few tricks I've picked up along the way...

Coming up to my first 100hours of being smoke-free 2016! I've been smoking for about 17 years, managed to quit for 1 year, 9 months, and a few 1 month breaks over the years but have always relapsed. 

I got married just over 4 years ago, and my husband and I decided to quit together, and start trying for kids. Fast forward 9 months, nothing had happened, and the frustration got to us, so we both started again. Since then, have gone through countless fertility treatments, acupuncture sessions, etc, and I'll stop for the week leading up to an ivf treatment, but the moment I find out I'm not pregnant, I'm back on the smokes. I'm due for a double embryo transfer at the end of this month, and I really want to get healthy, both physically and emotionally for this, which is why I'm going to try to quit for good this time.

Each time I stop it doesn't really get any easier. The first 72 hours are probably the worst. The lethargy and brain fog are almost unbearable, and I constantly feel trapped in thought spirals which, if left unbroken, will undoubtedly lead to failure (happened twice the 2 consecutive days before my final quit date). This is what I'm doing differently this time round:

- Smoke Free app: I got the pro version which gives daily missions for the first 30 days. I also keep a quit diary and can log my cravings. 
- puzzles: I downloaded a bunch of puzzles on my phone, and play a few games when I need a distraction from a craving
- small tasks: I am a master procrastinator, so I keep a list of small annoying tasks that I've been meaning to get around to for forever! Yesterday I decluttered the bookshelves in my room. Today it'll be my toiletries! I love the feeling of having beat another craving, and the sense of achievement of finally having done something I've been nagging myself to do!

- sparkling water with lemon and lots of ice: I can't remember where I read this tip, but am loving this. It's refreshing and the bubbles feel great on my tongue. I drink it in an insulated glass and with a straw so there's a greater sense of occasion
- visit forums: this sub has been really helpful. I'm quitting alone (husband isn't ready), so it's nice to have somewhere to come to for support (even if I'm just lurking most of the time).
- Allen carr's No More Ashtrays: this helped tremendously the time I managed to quit for 9 months. It's a couple of hours read cover to cover, and It's even distilled down to a couple of pages of key points at the end. I just keep it around and open to a random page whenever I feel weak.

Anyway. Sorry for the ramble. Hope these tips help someone!

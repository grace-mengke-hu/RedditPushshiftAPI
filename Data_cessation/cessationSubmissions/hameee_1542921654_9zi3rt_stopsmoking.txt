Just a follow up: I managed to stop smoking and I've been clean now for 4 days

I posted here a few days ago about fucking up and (almost) smoking a full pack. I'd really like to thank the people who came to my aid and told me to throw that pack away, instead of finishing it. I've now been smoke-free for 4 days, and I've hardly got any cravings.

To you new quitters out there, don't give up. You can do it. Just remember one important fact: smoking does literally nothing for you, and takes away so much.

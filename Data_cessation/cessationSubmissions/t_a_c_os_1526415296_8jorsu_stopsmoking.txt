All my anxiety is gone

Just under 4 months since I quit and all my anxiety is gone. I've been dealing with it for over 5 years accepting it as just being something I had to live with even though it prevented me from living my life to the fullest and doing fun things. I had no idea that my anxiety was caused from my smoking. Just wanted to let people know who could be reading this with anxiety looking for a reason to quit.

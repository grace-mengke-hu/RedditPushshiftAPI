planning

My birthday is next month and I'm wanting to treat myself with the ending of the longest bad decision of my life. I'm a ten year veteran of smoking. I'm 26 now and recently watch my grams pass on from lung cancer. This same woman gave me my first cigarette.  I have attempted cold turkey and fell on my face. I made it one and a half days... I'm not proud, and I'm not ashamed of asking for advance from those who have done it and are going through it. Thank you.

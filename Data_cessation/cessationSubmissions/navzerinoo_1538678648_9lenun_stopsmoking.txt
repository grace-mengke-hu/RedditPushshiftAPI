Stay away from apothecaries

I tried to get something against my headaches on my day 3 of quitting smoking at the apothecary. When I told them it was because I was quitting smoking, they tried convincing me to supplement nicotine gums and sugar pills for 50$, knowing full well I was craving nicotine. Even when I said no, they continued on about how nicotine sugar pills helps, and it's the best way to quit.

Now I don't know if they were actually douchebags, really fucking gullible, or if it was the companies that made them pray upon people trying to quit. Either-way that's way uncool. Thankfully I had my friend with me, we told them off and went. 

I'm getting more and more convinced that society is just deep-rooted evil, and that money can make people do anything. Sorry for this rant but this has really pissed me off. If I didn't have my friend with me I probably would have bought it, and I would be back to zero progress. Do companies actually make money on selling other peoples soul?

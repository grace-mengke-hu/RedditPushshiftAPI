I ran (jogged) further today than I have in 20+ years!

I am very pleased. smoked for over 20 years, been quit for 20 days today (badge wrong - late to the sub). I had a serious craving and my brother told me to jog it off, so I did, it worked very well. Only did about 2 or 2.5km's but that's something!!

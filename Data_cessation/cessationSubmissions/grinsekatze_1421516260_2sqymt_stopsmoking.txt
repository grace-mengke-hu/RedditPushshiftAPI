My girlfriend stopped smoking after 10 years of 1 pack/day. What can i do to help her?

First of all: I dont smoke.

My girlfriend just stopped smoking yesterday. 

Right now she is depressed as hell. Starts crying for no reason. Basically we spent the last few hours in bed with her permanently crying and sobbing. And there is nothing i can do or say ro make her stop. 
She is great for giving it up, and i want to give her all the support i can. But i am not gonna lie: its taking a toll on my nerves as well. And i fear the days to come.

I looked online for some programms and sites that offer help, but she doesnt want any of that right now.

Any advice on how i have to behave is welcome. 
What should i do or say to help her? What would you want in a partner?

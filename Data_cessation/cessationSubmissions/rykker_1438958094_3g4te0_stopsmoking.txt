Made it to 7 days today! Oh God, the triggers!

This is my first serious attempt at quitting and I've made it to 7 days (personal best out of all my attempts) and still going strong at resisting the urge to smoke....   But so many triggers hit me... waking up in the morning, office breaks, before/after lunch, after meetings, after gaming, after workouts, before bed.... so so many triggers that I catch myself in.... Fortunately I'm on Champix this time around which prevents the triggers from turning into urges... I only really experience an urge/craving once or twice a day that usually goes away quickly.

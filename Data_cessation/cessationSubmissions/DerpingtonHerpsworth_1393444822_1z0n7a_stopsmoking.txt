No cigs for three months. I still have no intention of going back but keep getting these nagging thoughts.

I'm really proud to have made it this long.  It's a huge milestone and I have no intention of throwing that away.  I'm still vaping, but at a lower nic level than I started at.

The problem I'm having is my own stupid brain trying to get me to try it again.  Things like "if you just have one every couple days you'll be fine".  I also happen to be coughing a lot due to a cold, which the ecig exacerbates, and my brain tells me "maybe a real cig wouldn't make you cough as much".  

I guess if there's any point to this post other than giving me a venue to rant, it would be this... 

To those who have reached this point before, do these kinds of thoughts keep coming?  Is this as easy as it gets?  I mean, I'll probably be able to stick with it, but it's become an annoyance.

Day 1

Tobacco chewer for the past 15 years. Was on my way home from softball tonight and was going to stop and pick up a tin but i decided againat it.  Windsprints at the park instead!  
I quit drinking years ago and it was a great decision. Quitting chew will be an even better one. Posting this here because this time its going to be different.

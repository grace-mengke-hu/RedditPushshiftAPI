I'm quitting today! Any cleaning tips to benefit me and my asthmatic girlfriend??

Hi all, after nearly 8 long years smoking, with a few months here and there in the last two years abstaining, I'm finally ready to pack it in.

Today is my last day smoking, and I wanted to know if anyone had any tips for getting the smell and the smoke particles off of your skin/ clothes/ hair/ phone and bag etc. I don't smoke inside anymore, and have moved house so I'm all good there, but my girlfriend is asthmatic and we are gonna be spending the weekend together for the first time in ages, so anything would be really appreciated.

Even after I've showered and brushed teeth etc, she's been able to smell it in the past. I wanna completely detox before she wheezes around me and dumps me for a clean living dude.

Cheers, and have a great weekend everyone!

100 times of trying .just found you guys let's try somethimg different

I am 29 years old and been smoking since 15 years old.Been thinking about quitting when i was 25 but use to smoke when i drink. Just can't stop to smoke when i drink. Any tips. I didn't even drink so that i would i would smoke but that didn't happen for long. I am on and off smoker i can go easily 4 ,5 days without smoking and suddenly some stress comes up and i need one that is how i buy a pack and end of finishing the pack smoking for few days till it is finished. 
I am not going to smoke today it is going to be hard for few days but support me folks i am in your hands now. I would like to tell everyone i definitely quit this time.

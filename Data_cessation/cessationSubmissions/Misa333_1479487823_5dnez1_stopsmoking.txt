I need some advice handling myself at work.

Today is my third day, I still feel light headed and I am having trouble focusing. The coughing has gotten worse as well. I work as a janitor at a mall. Is there anything I can do to get the symptoms under control?  Also, should I change my routine so it's different from when I smoked, or should I continue with my normal routine? Any and all help would be great, thank you!

3 Years Later and I Finally Got My Courage Back

I was a pack a day smoker from 2008 until now, a week left in 2016. 

My first serious quit attempt was in 2013. I was in the USMC having just gotten off of a deployment in the South Pacific. I was able to quit smoking for about a month, longer than I had ever gone without of my own volition. 

I relapsed, hard.

I did some dumbshit things with a few of my Marine buddies that revolved around our mustaches and a 1-star General and Facebook. Long story short: We had mustaches, General didn't like that, we made fun of him and the whole situation on Facebook. 

The Facebook posts got back to him and even higher than that, so our superiors said that it was entirely possible that we could have a series of punishments thrown at us so hard that we would all end up out of the military with dishonorable discharges. So I broke. I picked up a bottle of whisky and split it with one of the Mustache Crew and ended up smoking that night. One turned to two turned into a pack.

4 weeks of hard work and constant dedication to being a non-smoker thrown away because some Brigadier General wanted to get huffy about a mustache. 

Nothing ended up happening from The Mustache Incident except that I fell back into the everlasting chain of smoking.



WELL, GOOD NEWS EVERYONE: I FINALLY GOT BACK ON THE HORSE AND I AM ONCE AGAIN A HAPPY NON-SMOKER.

My badge was at 1,076 days from when I quit that last time and lost hope and unsubbed. The joy of seeing that smiley face next to "1 Day" is impossible to describe. I am sure most of you know the feeling.

I'm glad to be back and I thank you for having me.

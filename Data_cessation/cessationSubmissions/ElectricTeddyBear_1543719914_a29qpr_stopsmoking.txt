I want to quit, but that first few daaays.

I'm 21 and have been smoking for 5 years, but I'm ready to quit. I've gotten a day and a half in before, but then I just feel like I'm dying. Do you guys have any helpful hints or anything for the first week or so? I think that'll be my hardest area, and I really, really want to quit.

Thanks ahead of time. I super appreciate it!

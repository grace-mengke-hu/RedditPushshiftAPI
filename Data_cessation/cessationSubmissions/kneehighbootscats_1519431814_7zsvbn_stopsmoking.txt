At the 5 day mark

First time post sorry in advance if what I’m about to say brings up stuff for people. Always willing to share experiences and support people who have been through the same thing.  If anyone needs support please do not hesitate to message me. 

5 days ago I did a pregnancy test and it was very surprisingly positive.

As if by fate prior to me taking the test I smoked the last cigarette in my packet mentally making a note to buy more the next day. 

But then that extra line showed up and I knew I had just smoked my last ciggie. 

I lost both of my first two pregnancies and I was attempting to quit smoking with both. Though I had reduced the amount I was smoking i was still having at least one a day. I knew at the time it was wrong and I wasn’t proud of myself for it. 

This time around I felt different all of sudden there was a positive test and it just clicked in my head there is no way I’m smoking another one. 

It’s hard to explain I hadn’t been planning to give up or anything at that point and I was still content smoking but yeah this conviction came over me and I just stopped. 

Anyway wish me luck

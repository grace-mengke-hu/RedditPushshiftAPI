Doing what they say not to, but here's going NOTHING!

15 years of smoking and decided on my 132nd attempt that this is IT!! LOL OK, so maybe exaggerating the 132 attempts but it sure feels like it! They say to keep New Year's resolutions simple so you don't fall and feel like a complete failure. They say to make easily attainable goals that will take some effort to achieve but not life changing....well, I decided to quit smoking for the new year. I also know that when I drink, I have to smoke so drinking was cut out as well. I know that when I eat like crap, I like to smoke afterward so I quit that too. LOL what am I thinking?! No smoking, drinking, 420, fast food, or pop....AND I have to add exercise, water, healthy foods to my life? :-O

So far so good actually. I'm using vape mod box with 3mg nicotine juice, twisting my own coils to save money. I've found the combination of using the vape and a "Smoke Free" app I downloaded has really helped this tough process. I know it's only day 4, but this time I feel slightly "excited" about this and the fact that I won't smoke ever again. The only downside is having some sleepless nights and stomach discomfort which I hope will pass in the coming days. It's totally worth being a little tired and uneasy for a few weeks than being hooked up oxygen or weeks in the hospital due to respiratory issues. Anybody who joined me in quitting on New Year's KEEP IT GOING! If you are reading this, chances are you are still smoke free!

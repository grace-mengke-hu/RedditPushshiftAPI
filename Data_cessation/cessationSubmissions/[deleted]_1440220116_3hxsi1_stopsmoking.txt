I'm dreaming of cigarettes.

So it's been a surprisingly easy going 4 days, every other time I've decided to quit it lasts one day at the most but this time I'm actually ready. The days are fine but as soon as I take a nap or go to sleep for the night I have multiple dreams about smoking. I'm talking my night is filled with smoke to the point where I wake up and am guilty because I felt it really happened. Then the nostalgia sets in and I want to take that morning cup of coffee and recreate the dream. It's almost a longing feeling for an old friend.
But then I remember that my lungs are starting to feel better and the thought of that half marathon I ran last year creeps in... and it all seems worth it. I don't want to feel disappointed in myself again. I want to save money, run and not hack up a lung in the morning. At 23 who the fuck should?
Thank you for this subreddit. Every single time I have even an ounce of a craving I come and read your stories of success or trouble and they both help just the same.

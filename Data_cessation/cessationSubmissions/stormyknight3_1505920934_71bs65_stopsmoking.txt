Last Month, I F***ed Up

Oy... I had gotten really far, and even beat my record of surpassing 130 days.  Then I made exceptions... and excuses... and then even bought smokes a few times.

For about 2-3 weeks I was not keeping strong, and it felt pretty helpless. BUT, I'm back at it.

My biggest fear is getting through the first month, as it was the toughest in the past.  I've got my patch on, and I'm trying to keep positive.  If the last 3 weeks taught me anything, it's that I don't like smoking--its an addiction! One that will sneak up and bite ya!

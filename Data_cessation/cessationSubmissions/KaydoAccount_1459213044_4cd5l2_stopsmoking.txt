What kind of a ride am i in for?

I have no idea if i'm in the right place.

After the end of the uni semester i have around 5 weeks. After this terms final exam i plan to quit smoking and drop my caffine habit while continuing to work out.

I've had a history of weed, smoking and caffine abuse for vices. For caffine i used to take around 350-400mg on a daily basis to cope with work in short time periods resulting in caffine highs. At the same time i'll smoke around 20 cigarettes a day along with a few joints after i finish work. All of this is how i coped for over 2 years before i started university earlier this year and i've decided it's time to drop everything in the hope to recover anything left of my cognative abilities. I've went from being an arrogant intellectual prick to a slow bogan.

What kind of a ride am i in for? Could i start seeing tangible benefits by the time uni starts up again

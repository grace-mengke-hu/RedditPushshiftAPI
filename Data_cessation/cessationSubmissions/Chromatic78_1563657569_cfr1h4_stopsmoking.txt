Scared as I approach my last cigarette

I am quitting in 6 hours. I have the match ready; does it make a difference if I put it on at night when I'm pumped up with nicotine before bed? 

I know I can do this. I smoke 1.5 packs a day. I have listed my reasons for quitting, and followed all the tips in the Smoke Free app. I have two younger children and a husband cheering me on. 

My mood has changed today though as if I'm saying goodbye to an old friend. Will need support. I love reading all the success stories here. Even 24 hours is amazing!

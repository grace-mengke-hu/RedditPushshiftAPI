Day 18 issues.

Hey guys, nice sub.
I'm almost 19 days in. I quit after I came down with 4 different illnesses and my doctor said it's time. I figured they were correct and haven't had a drink or a smoke since.
The first week was hell and I'm still a tad irritable but I'm completely over smoking and comfortable without doing it.
I'm 26 and smoked about 75% of a pack/day for the 6/11 years that I did smoke. 
MY ISSUE NOW THOUGH is that I wake up every morning for the last 3-4 days hacking up quite badly. Almost to the point of puking. Is there any reason for this? I work at a steel mill and figured it could have been attributed to that, but I'm concerned. Are my lungs purging the damage from smoking or being sick?
Did anyone else have issues with twitching eyes, extreme bouts of anxiety, depression, or negative physical ramifications 2+ weeks after quitting?
Thanks in advance for reading and/or your replies!

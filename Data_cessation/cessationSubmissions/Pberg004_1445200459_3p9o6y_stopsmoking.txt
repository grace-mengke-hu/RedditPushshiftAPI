Dreaming about smoking 😳

Last night I had a dream that I fell back into smoking. I've only been smoke free for 7 days, but I remember panicking and being so disappointed with myself in my dream.  I'm hoping that this time quitting is the last time.  That dream was terrifying and I hope was just a reminder of the way I will feel if I got back to it 😁

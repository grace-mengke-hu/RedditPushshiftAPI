Hookah?

It's been 1 week since I [blew off my fiancee for a cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/26nhgy/blew_off_my_fiancee_for_a_smoke_this_needs_to_stop/) and resolved to quit for good.  I've been ciggie free since.

However, we have a hookah pipe in our house and we both smoke it multiple times a week.  Does smoking a hookah negate my progress with cigarettes?

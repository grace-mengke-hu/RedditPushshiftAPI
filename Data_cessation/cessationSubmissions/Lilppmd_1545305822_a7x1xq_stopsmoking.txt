Second attempt

Smoker got over 39 years. 

I did stop smoking earlier this year for about 4 months. It was great! My car did not stink, I did not make decisions based on how to get a smoke and I generally felt better about myself. I then started to think about how I wanted to try a cigarette again, to remember what it felt like. Big mistake. It took me months to get back into another attempt as my smoking went right back to where it was. 

I learned a lot as a result of this relapse. I learned how sneaky addiction is and how it messes with your mind. It creates all sorts of romanticized images in oneâ€™s mind about using. Mostly it tries to make one forget the craziness of addiction.  

The cravings are strong after one week, but I will keep going. Step 1: I am powerless over nicotine and my life has become unmanageable.

Nervous about this weekend - first time drinking during this quit

This weekend, I'm going camping with some friends. I haven't had much alcohol since I quit this time around, and usually that is when I cave and end up smoking again. I don't plan to bring any cigarettes (even though the nagging addiction in the back of my mind tells me to buy some just in case I want them)...and luckily these friends aren't smokers so I don't expect anyone to have any. But I'm so nervous that I'll have crazy cravings while drinking at night while we camp. I haven't drank without smoking in a really long time, and it had gotten really bad right before I quit about a week ago.

I guess I'm just looking for some support and advice here! I guess I'm lucky because these aren't smoking friends so I really have no options as long as I don't cave and buy some cigarettes on my way out there.

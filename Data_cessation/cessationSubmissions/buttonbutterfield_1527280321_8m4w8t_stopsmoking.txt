How do I quit when I have depression and anxiety?

Hi, I'm new here but have been looking at the messages here on and off for a while.

I'm 23 and have been smoking for 10 years - I want to stop but whenever I attempt to stop cold turkey, I get so depressed that I end up sleeping all day and feeling horrible so I start again because I already struggle with my mental health enough as it is and it feels like stopping smoking aggravates it :( 

I do want to quit smoking but I really can't deal with the mental struggle when it exaggerates my depression and anxiety (i know I sound weak) ... does anyone have any experience or tips ?

Thanks in advance :)

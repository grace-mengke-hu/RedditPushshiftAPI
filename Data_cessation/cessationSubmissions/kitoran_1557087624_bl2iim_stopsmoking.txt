Another milestone - four weeks!

Frankly, I don't experience health benefits people talk about - i'm still easily tired, breathing is still not ideal and boogers are still formed up my nose. I beleive some of this is due to hep c which I found out I have. And some of this is probably due to sitting job, poor air quality at work and also there's just much work. Desipte all that you'd think I'd feel better when I stop actively poisoning myself. I will see how it goes from there, and of course I have no intentions to ever smoke again.

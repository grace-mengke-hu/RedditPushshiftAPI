Quit. been like 3-4 days now. But I've taken 2 puffs off a cigarette. Help!

So I've quit for 3-4 days now. But yesterday night after studying till 5am I had a puff , 1 puff of a cigarette, felt disgusting and threw it away. then today earlier I came back from the exam and said okay Im chilin lets see how a cigarette feels. again I took 1 puff and immediately put it out, like wtf am I doing, this is so so gross. Now technically i've relapsed and those 2 little puffs probably quenched some of my nicotine addiction. I feel terrible. I feel I could take another random puff again. I still consider myself as completely quit, but what I wanna know is if I take a single puff of a light say once in 3-4 days, and keep this up for a while, would nictone urges completely go away? would I still be a smoker. Now ofcourse I know, its masssively addictive, 1 puff is disastrious. I know this. I am fighting, I don't want someone to say "oh 1 puff is fine ur chilling". I know I've been weak. I am a weak person (tried to quit many many times in the 8 months I've smoked) (smoked dokha before which is why my nicotine addiction is so bad). Anyways Whats my status here? tonight I'll go to bed, maybe another day I'll have a single sickened puff then again feel how I feel now, weeks/months will go by and I'd have reduced how much I've smoked immensely. yet I'd feel like an addict. I am still to encounter how I feel under the influence of alcohol. I am scared if I drink alcohol i will certainly smoke. fuck this. I wish I never ever had a cigarette. I will keep fighting/ keep relapsing minutely till I die. 1 thing is for sure as of now, I still havent had 1 whole cigarette, and this for sure I know I can maintain. I just hope the urges vanishes.

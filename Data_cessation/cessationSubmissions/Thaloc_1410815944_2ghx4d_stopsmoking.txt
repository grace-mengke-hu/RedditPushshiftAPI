Just checking in

Still hanging tough, and stayin smoke free. My best friend came and hung out for a bit last night for the first time since I quit. He is a chain smoker like crazy, like 2 packs a day. We usually hang out a couple times a week and have a few beers, burn some flowers, listen to music, and smoke out in my studio while I melt glass. I didn't have the urge to bum a smoke at all.

My main triggers are in between prep work and making stuff I like to have a smoke, or if I have a spectacular failure, or if anything doesn't go just as planned... It had been hard to stay motivated and creative out there this last week, but the last few nights have been much better. I think I really got this beat

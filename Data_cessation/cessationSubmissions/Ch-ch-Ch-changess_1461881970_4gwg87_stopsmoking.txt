I've stopped last Chirstmas eve,,,, or did I?

Okay,,, since the last X-mas eve, I've smoked total of two cigarettes. Both of them last month.

Do I reset from the last cigarettes which was month ago, or have I been smoke free since the X-mas? I tell people that I've quit since last year but I still kinda feel guilty about smoking last month. Am I being a liar? Do I really have to say that it has only been a month?

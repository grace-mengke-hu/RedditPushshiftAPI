How do you let go of guilt??

For me it’s not quitting that’s the problem even though I had a smoke yesterday when I was drunk. I don’t have a lot of cravings and I know if the day is shit, it’s gonna be shit even if I smoke. But the guilt is eating? How did I go from a martial artist and a ballerina to a disgusting smoker. I can only imagine what I smelled like when I smoked. I can only imagine how much I missed out because everyone would socialize and I’d be outside smoking. I can only imagine how much damage I’ve done to my body and how much money I’ve spent. I just feel so guilty and angry with myself. How do I forgive myself?

117 days nicotine free but need help

I am an ex dipper of 117 days and recently my job has undergone changes which has made my job insanely demanding.


I almost went to the store to buy some nicotine gum to cope with this insane level of stress but i know its just me not knowing how to cope or manage stress.


Any advice for heated times when life gets really hard?

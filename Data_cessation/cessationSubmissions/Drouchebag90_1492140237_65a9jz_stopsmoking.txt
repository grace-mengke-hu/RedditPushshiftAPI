Looking for advice. I want to quit, but not sure how to start.

Title pretty much says it all. I want to quit and regain some endurance. As it stands now. A light job from my car to my house makes me winded and I'm sick of it. I like being active and I used to run 2+ miles everyday. I want to get back to that. If anyone can give me some good pointers on how to get started quitting, I'd love to hear your suggestions. 

Ps, I do have a vape and it's been helping cut down the amount of cigs that I smoke, but I still like to wake up with a cig and smoke a cig after work, or after eating. 

Thanks in advanced for all the advice.

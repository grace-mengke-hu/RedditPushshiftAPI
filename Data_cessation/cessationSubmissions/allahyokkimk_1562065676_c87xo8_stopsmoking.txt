started again...

i have been trying to quit for the entirety of this last month and with things in my life being in total chaos,(will become homeless again starting august, may lose my job, completely lost my best friend, will never see my cats again because he will take them, just went through depression, have constant anxiety about everything etc.) i thought it would be a great idea to stop now! may sound weird, but i thought if i could quit on June, I wouldn't start ever again! 

now yesterday i had an argument with that said friend and he has said pretty hurtful things to me, so i just went and bought a pack... smoking it right now, contemplating... a lot of things.

hope i can find it in me to stop once in for all someday.

Not had a cigarette in 30 hours!!

I wasn't expecting to quite but it seems like I'm doing fine so far. 

I was at a party the other day and got real drunk, during my hangover yesterday I was way too tired and confused to even think about lighting one up. 

I really don't know how I've managed to not smoke or even crave one! I'm so happy because usually I would have lot one up by now cuz of how stressful everything is

Finally smoked a cigarette and it was gross instead of satisfying

I have been weening myself off cigarettes with an e-cig (it's helped me quit 2 separate times). And every time I've quit there comes a point that cigarettes, even while drunk, just taste gross.

That time has finally come again. I'm more serious about quitting now then I ever have been before, and it's going to stick this time.

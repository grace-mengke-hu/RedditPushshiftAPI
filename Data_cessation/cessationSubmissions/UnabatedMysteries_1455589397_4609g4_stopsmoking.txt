First try was an epic failure

I decided to hit after I smoked 4 packs in two days. I've been smoking since I was 13 (almost 28) and I really have no desire to quit but know I absolutely need to. I can't afford it anymore and I already have spinal cancer along with a plethora of other issues like anemia, bipolar, etc. 

I made it 3 days quitting cold turkey and when I found out my identity was stolen today, I caved. I didn't buy a pack, but I bummed some from a friend. 

Anyone have any tips.. Or tricks to kick this? I can't do the patch because it gives me nightmares, can't chew gum because it screws with my neck (another health issue) and I have to be careful of how many sweets I eat (suckers). 

Any advice will be appreciated.. And thank you in advance.

How long did it take you.....

.... to stop missing smoking when drinking/socialising?

I know a lot of you stopped drinking too but I haven’t. I’m on day 60-something (stopped checking the app - just want to be past 90 days now) and still just miss smoking when I have a drink. I’m guessing it’s one of the hardest associations to break. But I’ve been out and had a drink several times since quitting and it still feels...... a bit sad.

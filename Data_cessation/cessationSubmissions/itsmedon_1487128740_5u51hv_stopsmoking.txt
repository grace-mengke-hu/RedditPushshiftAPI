Relapsed after 7 days. Hello old friend, sadness

Was on the longest streak I've had in 2 years. Been a smoker for 7 years prior. My trigger was a fight with my sister, who was the closest person in my life. I feel like there's no return and no-one else I can trust. Took work off today and will probably do so the next week.

Mr Carr really helped me get those 7 days of freedom. But right now I'm imprisoned by loneliness, and the only friend are these cancer sticks.

One month in today.

Thanks to the smoke free app and this subreddit. 

This was quit attempt 27474837373 I think. But this time, it just felt right.

I had a few strong cravings around day 21, but the main thing that worked for me were big long deep breaths of fresh air, really feeling that air getting deep into my lungs. 

That and meditation. I didnâ€™t have the excuse of not having time to meditate in the mornings, because I always found time for cigarettes.

Good luck to everyone! You can do this

Warning about ecigs to those trying to taper down.

This might get a little rambly since I can't sleep and I'm withdrawing so sorry in advance.   

So I just retired after 30 years serving in the Coast Guard during which time I would smoke 3-5 cigarettes a day since the very beginning of my service.  When I got out I bought a very nice ecig, one of those mods that you drop your juice onto.  Well I liked it a little too much and not only did my nicotine use double up despite vaping 3mg, I continued to smoke at least one cigarette a day.  This is entirely my fault of course and could be avoided but it's made me think that ecigs maybe aren't the best way to go.  Sure they're safer than cigarettes but the point for most people is to stop using nicotine.   So I've decided to go cold turkey as that is in my opinion the best way.  You may suffer more each day, but for fewer days.  Tough it out and you'll be free of withdrawal in a fraction of the time.  

That said I still think ecigs are a great tool for cessation, but can easily lead people to increase their addiction even if they actually stop smoking real cigarettes unlike me.  So for those about to quit and considering your options this is an important point to bring up.

And one more thing that's just irritating me about my flair.  I quit Monday August 10th but I smoked my last cigarette and snapped my ecig in half at 8pm.  Well that means it's off by 20 hours.  I'm tempted to set it back a day but in my easily irritable state right now that would be equally annoying.  Perhaps there should be an exact time of day you can tell it so that it's more accurate.

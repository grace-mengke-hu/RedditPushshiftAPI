Here goes number 3...

I've been a lurker on this sub for a couple months now. I grew up watching my grandfather die of lung cancer. I was always so against smoking and said I'd never try it. Well, a year and a half ago, I was out drinking with friends and someone offered me a puff. I was being stupid and thought, "why the hell not?" A year and a half later, at a half pack a day, I'd give anything to go back and slap myself in that moment. 

I've tried to quit 2 times before. Partially due to the help of watching this sub. But today I smoked the last cig in my pack and I wanna be done. I hate them, I hate the smell, I hate the way they make me feel about myself. But I know I need to commit. Hence this post. I know I can't do this alone, and I wanna be a part of this community. So here's to making this time stick! 

TL;DR- I'm quitting, and I wanna join all of you! (-:

Few questions about timelines

Ok so I am officially on day 12 of my quit, but on day 5 I slipped and had a smoke with a friend. 

Now my question- does everything restart from that slip? In terms of cravings, moods, etc. will I identify more with a day 12 non-smoker or a day 7 non-smoker? 

I read Allan Carr's book and it's been one of my easier quits (3rd time) definitely not painless, but much better than the other times.

Not that you need it but here's another reason to stop smoking

I'm buying mortgage insurance and since I stopped smoking for more than a year now I have the  "non-smoker" checked . Bam, lower premiums. 
Now now, is not all pink and roses since i do still have a higher risk than people who never smoked, and they did do a medical on me and stuff,  but it's a win. And a win is a win and you should take it.

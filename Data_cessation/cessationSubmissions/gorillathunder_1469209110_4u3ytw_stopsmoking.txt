I've never thought to post on here but I just hit one year, wanted to share my experience!

Hello quitters!

It only occurred to me today when I hit one year to check if there was a subreddit dedicated to helping people quit. I should have looked earlier. I will say that I didn't consider myself a BIG smoker but I hope they can help someone!

My first and key tip is visualisation. For a long time, I disconnected with the idea of quitting because to me, I'd convince myself that smoking 5 or 6 a day wasn't that bad and didn't cost me that much money. So one of the first things I did was download an app. Me personally, I have 'Smoke Free' on iOS but there's loads to pick from. Seeing the exact money you've saved, days that have passed, how your health has increased ALL contributed to a sense of achievement and positive attitude. 

Another big one is support. Now I understand that not everyone has someone in their life who can help them every day but for me, I had just got engaged and my fiancee was a massive help in reminding me everyday what I was working towards. Lastly, I was a cold turkey quitter but I used a few things to aid it. Chewing gum is a great starter, occupy your mouth, your hands everything. One massive thing to get over is the urge to do things with your hands.

If I had to give a warning about quitting, it's that when you quit you might replace it with something else! Now i'm (or was!) a relatively skinny dude but in a year, I went from a 32" waist to a 38", it was eye opening! 

If anyone has questions, I'd love to hear them. Here's my [app screenshot!](http://i.imgur.com/J8pHv0B.jpg)

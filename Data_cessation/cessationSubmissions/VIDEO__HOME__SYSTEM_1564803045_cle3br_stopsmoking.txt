How bad is the smell, really?

Half a pack to a pack per day (sometimes more when drinking) smoker here. I haven't quit or made any real attempts to yet, but I really want to sometime in the very near future, or at least switch to vaping.     

Has anyone ever found an old jacket that they used to always wear when they smoked and thought it stinked? I remember absolutely hating the smell of it when I was younger, but now it's just an afterthought since I'm around it so much. Is it really as bad as people say? If you walk past somebody or sit next to a table in a restaurant occupied with smokers, can you smell it? Sometimes I get kind of anxious when I go out for a cigarette after a meal then come back in, in case people are judging me by how I smell. My sense of smell is completely fucked right now, and it has become so normalized to me that it's hard to tell. Sometimes I'll even carry aftershave on me, wait a couple of minutes for the smell to go somewhat away, spray myself, then go back in. That probably doesn't even help though.  

I feel bad for my girlfriend too. She used to smoke, but now vapes. I try to limit my smoking when I'm around her, but it happens sometimes. Again, if we're at home I'll usually spray some aftershave before sitting next to her or cuddling up to her, and sometimes use strong minty mouthwash if we're getting down. I don't want her to kiss or sleep next to the smell of an ashtray. She's always said it's fine and she doesn't mind, but that's probably just her saying that to not make me feel bad.  

I never smoke indoors and would never, but my mother and sibling do. They both smoke anywhere from 20-40 cigs per day. Whenever I visit her place I never even notice the smell, but I'd imagine to a non-smoker that it stinks. 

So how bad is it, really? Do I just not notice it as much since I've became a smoker? Nobody has ever made any comments to me, but I feel like I stink all the time even though I don't realise it.

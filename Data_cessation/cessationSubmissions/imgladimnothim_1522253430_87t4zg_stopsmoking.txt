Man, nicotine gum makes you feel so much worse than smoking a cigarette does

Well, mentally, it makes me feel better because I know I'm not inhaling cancer causing fumes into my mouth, throat and lungs(not that nicotine gum won't possibly cause mouth cancer, but I don't plan on chewing it for very long). But physically, it makes me feel like shit. Chewing it feels fine, but the moment the nicotine gets in my saliva and that saliva-nicotine mix begins crawling down my throat, it feels like I'm having a slightly off-kilter case of acid reflux, in that it feels like acid reflux but the pain is not anywhere in my chest, just in my throat. I never have that feeling with cigarettes. Luckily I'm pretty committed to stopping smoking, and this gum does hit the receptors the way i want it to, so I will make it work I reckon. Should be jumping down from 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum this Saturday, then after that, I think I'll be able to go to plain old chewing gum just for the routine aspect, then I'll hopefully quit the chewing gum not too long after

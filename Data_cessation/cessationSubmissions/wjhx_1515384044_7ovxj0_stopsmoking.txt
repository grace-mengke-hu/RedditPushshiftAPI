100 days! I wish I could go back in time and tell myself how much easier it gets and how totally worth it quitting is.

The pain is temporary! It gets better every damn day. Every day not smoking is a victory and a respectable accomplishment. Today I hit 100 days and I had completely stopped counting. I've been trying to quit for years. 

To the new quitter and the struggling quitter I'd say: look, you're going to suffer either way. Life is full of inescapable suffering. We all know smoking causes lots of suffering, but the discomfort from quitting is at least dignified suffering.

You ennoble yourself by voluntarily taking responsibility for yourself, and the pain you endure is ultimately preferable to the everyday Hell of smoking.

What helped me most what keeping to a regular exercise schedule, bringing healthy lunches to work each day, and a shit load of coffee. But to be honest the first few days I just watched Netflix and did as little as possible. 

Set the bar low for yourself. Hit it, raise it, hit it again. Build momentum. The problem was never the smoking, but really just living a life where smoking was acceptable. 

Finally, stop thinking about it. You know everything you need to know about why quitting is the best option. Trust yourself and have faith that it will get better if you hang in there.

Weight gain after quitting?

Hey guys, im 21 years old - im smoking like 5 years around 1 cig per hour. I've always been overweight, was already obese in 2017 so i've decided to go on diet - counting calories and shiet, it was rough for me i failed few times but finally managed to do it - lost nearly 31 pounds in 4 months without single cheat day. It was great milestone for me but i also want to quit smoking i was reading recently that weight gain is common issue,aside increased appetite apparently smoking burns around 200kcal/day for an heavy smoker after quitting and i dont know if im using this as an excuse to not quit or is that real issue i really dont want my efforts and sacrifices to waste. So any tips how can i prevent that and finally move on?

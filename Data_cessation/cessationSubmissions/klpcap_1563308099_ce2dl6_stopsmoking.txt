6 days without a smoke - nightmares

So as the title says. I'm six day into quitting smoking. I've smoked for about 8 years and its exciting to think about not being tied to the stick anymore.

Anyways, what I came to talk about, is that I'm using a nicotine patch to help me quit. (I cant do cold turkey as much as I'd like to because my emotions are horrible and i need my emotions to be steady for my job). One of the things they tell you is to always take the patch off before you go to sleep because it will cause vivid and horrible nightmares. 

Well, last night, as you can guess, I forgot to take it off. I'm never scared of my dreams so it didnt affect my sleep, but MAN, they were not joking. I remember every detail and horror of it. Strangest dream I think I've ever had. I'm a pretty active dreamer too and 9 times out of 10 will remember my dream, but this by far takes the cake of anything in my dream journal. 

The dream had evil my little ponies in it (I have a 4 year old daughter who's obsessed) and a flood of blood. Horrifying to say the least. But honestly, might do it again because if gives my dream journal some great content. Haha Anyways, this got long. Just wanted to share.

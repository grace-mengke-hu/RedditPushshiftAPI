I spent how much? I'm giving some back!

the day after I quit I downloaded the Cessation Nation app for my phone. It's been very cool to watch the health benefits and my statistics change. What I didn't realize was how much I was spending on cigarettes each month. I smoked seven cigarettes a day, buying two packs on Sunday that would last me more than the full week. I didn't realize even at a low smoking rate how quickly it would add up. At day fifteen I was at $40. So for a full month I will have saved $80. 

As a celebration of this milestone I will increase my monthly contributions to a favorite charity from $20 to $50. I will still have $50 a month more to spend on me!!! It's a win win!!

P.S. 18 days now and still going strong. Each day it gets easier to say no to invitations to go smoke with friends.

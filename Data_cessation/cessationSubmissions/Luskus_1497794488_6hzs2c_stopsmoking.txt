How do you overcome the belief that you can't do it?

I've tried to quit smoking several times and have not made it longer than a couple of days and every time I feel like trying again, I kind of just expect to be overwhelmed by the withdrawal and to pick it up again. Even now, I want to quit and I told myself I would stop if I ever saw it affecting my health, but whenever I think of quitting, I just "know" I will succumb to temptation. Any tips on changing my mindset?

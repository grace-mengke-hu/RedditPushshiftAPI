102 days. How I did it. And why you should be a warrior

Hi r/stopsmoking,

I've never posted here before, but I did read some advice here and there.

I was a smoker for 11 years. I've smoked about 2/3 of a pack per day.

On August 25 this year is stopped smoking. It was my first try ever.

What I did was simple. I was going through a pretty stressful time and I had to adopt a warrior personality - do something no matter what. I had to. I've had 2 jobs at that time, needed the money and had to push it through.

I didn't set the day. I just thought to myself: "Smoking is disgusting, I should stop".

Now the beginning was tough, but way easier than I imagined. 

What helped me the most were this simple words in my head: "Don't smoke on purpose".

Sounds weird right? But it worked like a charm for me. Smoking was such a big habit for me I would smoke after everything. A meal, shower, whatever stupid thing I was doing I just had to light one up. 

I was stressed, but I just said in my mind: "No, I'm not gonna smoke one now ...on purpose". Like I was getting revenge for something.

Night out drinking, willing to kill for a smoke, nope "I'm not going to smoke one on purpose".

After 3 weeks I knew I was out of the woods. Now I don't get even 1 craving anymore per day. I'm saved. Unless I do it out of stupidity in the future.

Good luck, 

It's worth it

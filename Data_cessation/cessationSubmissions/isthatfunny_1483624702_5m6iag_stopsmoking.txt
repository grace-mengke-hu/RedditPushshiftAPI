Finally in the right mindset to quit!

I've been smoking for around 30 years, but had a few year chunks where I'd quit. In the back of my mind I always had that mindset where I allowed myself special days in the future where I'd allow myself to smoke. Sometimes it would be a day or a weekend or a pack, sometimes it was a lead-in to a year or two. I've realized that crutch has just kept that addiction bug just below the surface in my brain, affecting me even when I wasn't smoking - always wondering, was this an ok time to break away and reward myself with smoking. 

The worst part, like the Carr book says, are the problems it caused in my head. Not the physical (which are bad enough) but the fact I was always working my schedule around it, my socializing, time with kids - it sat in the background directing and influencing my time and mindset. I'm all done, it's only been 4 days or so, but the cravings are immaterial, the reality is I don't have that mindset anymore, I'm a non smoker, there are no special dispensation days, I'm freed from the questioning. Wish me luck, and good luck to you all!

Don't give up. Don't give in. YOU CAN DO THIS.

If you're having a craving right now, stay strong. Go on to Google Streetview and "wander" through a new city. Watch a show like "The Office" where no one smokes. It's going to suck, and that's okay; it will pass, and it's your body recovering from damage. 

If you'd told me a few years ago I'd ever quit smoking, I would have laughed in your face. I smoked 2 packs a day, even through the flu and bronchitis, for 15 years. But I made a New Years Resolution last year to quit, and it was super shitty for about two weeks, but suddenly, I felt... not great, but SO much better. More confident. More able to tackle bad habits and make myself happier and healthier in small ways. It gave me the confidence to quit drinking. 

It's going to be bad for now. But you WILL feel better. Cigarettes are not the magic key to your happiness; they're not the only thing holding you together. They might seem like it, but it's a lie. You can be free. I believe in you.

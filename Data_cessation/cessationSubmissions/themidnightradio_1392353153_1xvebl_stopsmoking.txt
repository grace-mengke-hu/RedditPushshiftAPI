Strange, yet pleasant, development

I was wondering if anyone has had this experience. I'm one week smoke free and for the last few days, I've had a huge amount of energy. 

I mean, I'm getting up early, I'm extra-productive at work, I'm doing tons of housework, etc. 

This may all just be psychosomatic, but I feel like since I've quit, I have insane amounts of energy. Has this happened to anyone else?

How to quit when you live with people who smoke?

Sorry for possible wall of text coming in. 

So I haven’t smoked cigarettes for long. It was strictly vaping until this past January. I feel really dumb for starting but the nicotine addiction really has taken over. I really really want to quit. My mother died from lung cancer when I was 17. I have children. I have health issues that need to be dealt with. So I feel really guilty. Guilt is said to be a bad motivator, but how am I supposed to just let myself get away with doing this, and not feel bad about it?! I am reading Freedom from Nicotine- The Journey Home right now. It’s been really educational but also has made me feel even worse about smoking. I feel so dirty! I just feel riddled with filth and chemicals but I keep picking them up! I tried switching back to vaping but I keep ending up allowing myself cigarettes because I have this wierd idea that the cigarettes hold a stronger “nicotine punch”. I think one huge factor holding me back is that my husband and mother in law who lives with us both smoke too. Husband wants to quit as well but having been a smoker for way longer than me I think it will be hard for him. A few months ago we decided to stop buying cigarettes and we went like 2 1/2 days without them. He went and bought more and we were back in the habit all over again. 

I don’t blame my husband for me smoking. That was my choice. I would like for both he and MIL to stop but I understand if they’re not ready. I need to be able to quit without having to wait until they are, though. Is there a way I can do this? Anyone here have any experience in this type of situation? For now my plan is no matter what, don’t stop reading that book. Keep brainwashing myself and hopefully I will read enough, or get to a point where it clicks. I know I will be much happier without nicotine.

Please help.. I really need some inspiration!

I'm trying to quit smoking weed and cigarettes at the same time. I quit smoking cigarettes April 1st, but I still use tobacco in with my weed.. I smoke so much. All day. It's effecting every single part of my life. I'm broke as hell. Please. Please give me some inspiration to quit! My boyfriend has been begging me but it's so hard when I live with my mom and she smokes both!

2nd attempt at quitting.

New to this whole forum thing. I'm glad to have it though. So this is my second real attempt at quitting. The first time was about 3 years ago and I quit for 4 1/2 months. I haven't smoked in like 6 days and I am wearing a patch. But I am so exuasted. There isn't enough working out or caffine to kick me in to gear... I'm constantly dragging@ss. I don't remember feeling so drained, anti social and withdrawn period. Has anyone else felt this? I have no patches for when I wake up tomorrow... So I'm hoping that I can psychologically handle the withdraw tomorrow morning. I know  that it's mental. How do people do it cold turkey? Thanks for letting me vent!!

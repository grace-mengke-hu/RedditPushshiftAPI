Another reason I am glad I quit smoking.

SEX!
I hooked up with my FWB earlier this week, who is a smoker. It was the first time we have hooked up since I quit smoking, almost 2 months ago and I couldn't believe how much he still stunk with all of his clothes off!! It was a complete turn off and the sex wasn't that good, so I don't think that will be happening again. 

I can't believe I used to walk around smelling like that! I can't believe how much better my sense of smell has gotten. I know it's only been 2 months but I really feel like I am done! Good luck to the rest of you!

Books to help with anxiety management?

Hey Reddit, I'm about halfway through Allan Carr's book and it's so so good. Very helpful and eye-opening.

One of the reasons I quit smoking was so I could better manage my anxiety. *Needing* to step outside and chain smoke was not a suitable way to deal with stress and anxiety at all. Not to mention - the addiction was making me more anxious!

I was wondering if any of you have found any books or texts helpful with stress management and anxiety - similar to Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking? Just looking for something to help, provide me with some strategies, and help me change the way I deal with these things (because I recently started a job that's very high pressure and stress....blah).

My first post here, I almost forgot about smoking now.

I smoked for about 5 years and spent every extra rupee and time that I had on smoking. It was so bad that I did not have money to fill exam form and travel to exam location. I got in huge debt(note that I was student or just out of college in this period). That caused 2 years delay to get my degree. I easily spent 3000 to 5000 rupees per month on cigarettes.
I made so many attempts and promises to quit that I lost track of it. I failed so many times that I never failed at anything this bad ever before. Cigarette and quitting attempts dominated my life, my brain, my conversations. It became the whole of me. 
I was able to quit before for 15 days, once for 2 months. 
I lied to my family, friends and everyone I loved. The guilt was too much. I lost all confidence that but I still kept trying to quit every week, every day and 10 times a day. I failed every time.
I found Easyway To Stop Smoking helped me quit for 2 months last year but I started again after being fired from my job.
This time I don't know what was different but I quit successfully. I read easyway 30-40 times and this time it worked again.
My life has now turned 180 degrees. I have all the money I need, health, self respect, the fear and guilt is gone. I have a girl friend. I have all fancy clothes, shoes and a college degree finally.
By now I don't even notice that I was a smoker once. Last week my friends proposed to go to hookah parlor and I almost gave in(fortunately the plan got cancelled last moment). I still fear that I might relapse someday, but that urge to smoke is very less and I know that a cigarette is not worth the trouble it causes in life.
One thing that I have noticed is that the urge to smoke is maximum when I eat a lot of junk food. 
Just had to share this little story. I don't know what should be posted in this subreddit so I apologize in advance if this is wrong place to post this.

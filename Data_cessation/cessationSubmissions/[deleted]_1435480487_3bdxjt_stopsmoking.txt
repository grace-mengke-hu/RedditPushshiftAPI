If the Alan Carr shit doesn't work for you...

...for some people Alan Carr's way works. Fuck yes to theh. I salute you.

For some of us, there is no easy way. I'm here to say, don't be discouraged because it's not "easy". Maybe you need to take another approaxh and treat cigs as a powerful foe. A dragon. A balrog, and you're absolutely Gandolf in this fight. Feel free to tinker with framing this bitch. 
 
For me, the way to beat it is to admit that it is a powerful foe. The fucking devil itself. Then, I don't take this journey for granted. Cheers.

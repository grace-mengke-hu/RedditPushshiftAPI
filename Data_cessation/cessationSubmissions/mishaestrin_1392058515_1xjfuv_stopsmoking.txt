What is the most motivational thing someone has told you after you decided to stop smoking?

My friend stopped smoking, and I wanted to say something supportive, but I couldn't think of anything non generic. 5 days later she started smoking again and I felt like it was my fault for not affirming her decision.

So let me know what you would like to hear or have heard someone tell you that was motivational in your quitting process.

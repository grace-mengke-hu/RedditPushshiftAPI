It looked weird

I stood next to my smoking coworker just now, paying attention to what she was doing. The cigarette seemed weird, wrong somehow. I don't remember cigarettes looking wrong when I smoked. Her whole appearance, putting that in her mouth, it seemed like an addictive trick I don't quite remember to be that ill looking, that wrong. I'm glad it looks wrong now. I don't ever want to go back to smoking.

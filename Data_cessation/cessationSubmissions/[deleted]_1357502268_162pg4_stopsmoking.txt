I don't think I can afford to smoke anymore, and  I don't just mean financially.

I am a 15 a day smoker, have been for 5 years.  I read Allen Carr's Easy method, and thought it was a good read.  He says nobody really enjoys smoking and I agreed with him then.  But I find, after a few weeks of meditating on the subject (and smoking) that this is not the case for me.  I like smoking, I enjoy most things about it. The taste, the ritual and I don't mind the smell (I even like talking to the cashier, as he/she sells me my pack)  I want to smoke but feel I can't anymore.  I don't think I can afford to go through the horrors of Cancer or other terrible diseases. Financially (I work hard for my money damn it !) physically or emotionally.  I am just trying to make sense of my "habit" (or dependance, as Allen would put it) and why the book bothered me a little.  I think if I can put my ideas in the right order (in my head) quitting will be easier.  So, as of now, I feel I want to smoke, but simply can't.  Hopefully, the "want" part will fade away.

Yesterday had a huge migraine with aura, and now I feel terrible, and I can't help thinking that a cigarette would help me

Had a huge migraine yesterday, totally unrelated to quitting smoking, but as I feel bad today I keep thinking that a cigarette would make me feel better. It doesn't make sense, as it would decrease the oxygen supply to my brain, but I can't stop thinking about this. How can I stop thinking about this?

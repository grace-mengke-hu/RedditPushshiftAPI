How did you guys beat "I quit once, I can quite again" trap?

This is my third, or fourth time quitting. I would quit cold turkey and not smoke for weeks; Resits the urges and what not's, struggling but managing..then somehow, after a month or so.... I would give up to craving with stupid "Ok, one will not hurt; after all I managed for 2/4/6/8/ weeks with none" Then that one turns to two, three and before I know I it I would hear myself saying "well I will buy a pack and then I will quit again;" and then that will last for 3 months, until i decide to quit again. 

Anyway, it's just annoying and I am always pissed when that happens. Fingers crossed this time it will not

Hi r/stopsmoking. I stopped smoking. My jaw hurts.

I have [3 kids](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11836665_10206202419554224_6187985872854732873_n.jpg?oh=f09d11a316dd867c8f0ff9af5af9e540&oe=5680A041) and I just cant keep burning through money (and destroying my teeth). I'm unemployed for the last 5 months, yet I still had my wife buying me cigarettes every other day. It's so stupid. BUT I WANT ONE EVERY THIRTY SECONDS!

I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days, but i had some old cigarellos i was sneaking puffs of, to settle my nerves when my kids were getting really rambunctious... Ran out of those yesterday, so we will start counting from then.

3 small victories, I noticed 4-5 nice sized butts in the car ash tray. I threw them in the trash. I went for a walk when i got really annoyed the first day, i found most of a perfectly fine pall mall on the ground, carried it for two blocks looking for a way to get a light, decided to just crumble it up when i realized whoever i got the light from would see me lighting a dirty ground cigarette. And just a bit ago, i traded in about 12 dollars worth of change at a coinstar, and put it all in gas. Instead of half in gas and a pack of smokes.

I can totally do this.... any advice for jaw ... flexing? I keep finding myself biting my tongue or twisting my jaws around in ways that make my jaw sore after a while...

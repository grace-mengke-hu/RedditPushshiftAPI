YSK: If you're a US Veteran, they'll offer you patches plus nicotine gum to help you quit, possibly free of charge depending on your VA status.

In my VA anyways, in my initial health check, they asked me if I smoked.  I said yes, and it was the first thing they offered.  If they don't offer it to you, ask them.  The VA in some areas may be messy, but ask, and they may provide it free of charge.  

No guarantees, so don't go complaining to me if it's not free, but doesn't hurt to ask.

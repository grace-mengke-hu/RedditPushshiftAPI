Help! 6 weeks today but struggling

6 weeks today and to be honest it's not been too bad but for the last two days I've been struggling with my cravings which have suddenly reappeared. I came so close to picking up an e cig last night and the only thing that stopped me was the thought of going through nicotine withdrawal again. Out for drinks tonight and seriously worried about my willpower. Anyone had similar issues thus far down the line?

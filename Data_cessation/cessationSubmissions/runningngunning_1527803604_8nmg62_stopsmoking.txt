Day 12; things are going surprisingly well?

I’ve never made it this far without some sort of aid (occasional cheater cigarette, gum, patch, etc) and I feel fucking great. I had mentioned in a previous thread that I was in the middle of a move and needed an activity - I have a tendency to start smoking again when I’m bored.

After a trip to my local bouldering wall I think I found something to keep me active and engaged in exercise while making healthier life choices (namely smoking cessation and a balanced diet/sleep.).

My body fucking hurts but in a good way I’ve been mostly unfamiliar with. Happy to say I haven’t really thought much about cigarettes and I’m considering looking at my app less/counting days. 

So that’s where I’m at - how’s everyone else doing? What’re you doing to distract yourself from buying a pack?

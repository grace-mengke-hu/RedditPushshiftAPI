Quit smoking over a year ago, did some calculations

I quit on October 10th, 2011 (using Alan Carr's book) and although I don't need any motivation to stay quit, I did some calculations and I'm damn proud of myself; hopefully it can motivate someone else who is trying to quit!

I stopped smoking 65 weeks ago. I'd go through (on average) 3 packs of 25 in a week. That's almost five THOUSAND cigarettes I haven't smoked. That number is mind-blowing to me - I can't imagine seeing a massive pile of 5000 cigarettes and thinking it would take me just over a year to get through them.

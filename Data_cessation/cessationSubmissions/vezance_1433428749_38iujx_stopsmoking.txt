[Help] One of my close friends had started smoking

This guy, one of my closest friends over the years, has started smoking. I just found out. I asked him about it and he said, "dude I'm not an addict like you. I just smoke during parties and once every now and then."

I am coming up short on what to tell him. How do I convince him that literally every smoker says the same thing when they start?

Edit: title should have 'has'.

Day 3

Okay, so 10 years of smoking a 17 - a pack of day and have now have not had a cig in 2 1/2 days... Never thought this day would come let me tell you. I thought I would have broken by this point or been just completely hating my life but so far it's not been what I expected. DO NOT get me wrong this is probably the hardest thing I've ever done, I constantly have headaches, shaking, BORED OUT OF MY MIND, cravings are bad, constantly thinking about it, irritable, edgy, don't feel like talking to anyone... ever lol. 

When does all of this start to fade away? I really truly believe I can do this but I'm curious when all of this shit starts to fade away... I'm sure it's different for everyone but curious how long it took for everyone? I know the cravings will always be there but not on this level that I'm/We are going through with quitting your first week.

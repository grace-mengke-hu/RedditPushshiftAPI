One Month! A little reflection on the past month

This day last month, I kind of decided to just not smoke and see what happens. I wrote a little blurb on here to document it and got myself a badge. And yet, here I am! One month and still smoke free! 

For those of you who are thinking about starting or still in your first month, here's a little bullet point breakdown of my experience over the past 30 days:

- The third week was the hardest for me. I knew physical cravings were going to hit me during the first week; so, I was mentally prepared. I knew the mental onslaught would occupy the second week; so, once again, I was mentally prepared. But third week was a little bit different and caught me off guard. You see, mental cravings are always there, like that buzzing noise some batteries make. You won't be able to hear it when you have music playing or walking on the street. But just when you are about to take a nap in your comfortable bed, it buzzes faintly through the surrounding silence. It didn't get louder; it didn't just come to being. You are only hearing it now because you got rid of all the other sounds. So, when that long, drawn out craving hits, don't think you are relapsing or your body is reaching some kind of breaking point. It's a sign that cigarettes are really running out of ways to control you. Oh yeah, that little faint buzzing gets fainter and fainter.

- Drink lots of water. I love beer, and I drink a LOT of it regularly. However, when the quitting started, I had to seriously increase my water intake. If I didn't, my body would start to ache. Sometimes, I would even get buzzed faster. Drinking lots of water when you are not used to can be quite a drag. But you'll get used to it and maybe even enjoy it in due time. I split my intake between ice cold water and hot green/black tea. I found that tea really works well for killing off cravings. 

- Be mindful of your eating habits. As expected, my appetite shot up over the past month. I have yet to limit my food intake, but I can definitely see this being a problem for many people. I'm usually not truly hungry; rather, food going down your throat is kind of like a substitute for a cigarette throat hit. So, I ended up eating just for that. Fortunately, I needed to increase my caloric intake anyway, and the increase has been tapering off. But do keep an eye out for the increase and watch how much you are truly taking in. Drink some tea when you feel like eating. If you still want to eat after a cup of tea, then go eat. I found that most of my fake hungers would go away after some tea, tying into my last sentence from the previous bullet point.

- Dive head first into all your worst triggers. You know that feeling you get when you are all hyped up and ultra determined when first starting something? Kind of like all those people hitting the gyms after New Year's Eve? Use that to your benefit. I went to smokey bars every day for the first two weeks. I carried a nearly full pack and a lighter around at all times. I did things that would usually be accompanied by smoking. The most important thing is to know when to exit. Just like benching weights, you want to push yourself to your rep limit; that's called exercising. But you don't want to slap on another two 45lb disks and tell your spotter to go somewhere else; that's called being stupid. Go to smokey bars, but don't get buzzed. Carry a pack around, but don't take it out. Find some stress, but don't try to get your parents to disown you. Use that initial momentum and get some of the worst offending triggers out of the way.

- Sleep as much as you can. Your body will be relearning and readjusting to a lot of things. Some people have breakouts, some experience back aches, and I had pretty unpredictable fatigue points. Give in and let your body focus on what it needs to do. Trying to fight it and stay "normal" not only would cause immediate stress, but can also potentially start a downward stress spiral. For example, if I fought to stay awake when I'm at home, I would be stressing my body against its will. If I end up tired the next morning for lack of sleep, I would be stressing my body once again by operating in suboptimal conditions. This might affect my work performance, and getting yelled at by clients and bosses won't do anything good for quitting smoking. And this chain goes on and on. It's not worth it. Let your body help you quit.

That's it!

So, what happened to that pack of smokes I was carrying around? I made the day of a homeless guy when he asked me for a cigarette :)

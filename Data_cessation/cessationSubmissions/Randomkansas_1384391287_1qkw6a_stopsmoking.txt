I finally had enough

November 11th was my stepfathers birthday. He died two years ago of multiple cancers including lung. He smoked for over 30 years. I sat thinking about my two young children and the effect it would have on them if I wasn't there to watch them grow and raise a family. I almost cried thinking about not being there to protect them and guide them through life. I went to the local vape shop and bought a double pack for my wife as well. I am going to do away with the aid as well. I have smoked for fourteen years. I have over two days without a cigarette.

It's not the toxins and carcinogens that get to you first. It's knowing that this habit is going to kill you and wreck the world of people you love that eats you alive.

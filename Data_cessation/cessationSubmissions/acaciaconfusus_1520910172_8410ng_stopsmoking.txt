I quit smoking

One day I decided to quit cold turkey after about 6 months of smoking constantly. I returned to a normal state and had no withdraw simptems after 1 week. It was not anything like anyone else said! Also It's nothing compared to benzo withdraws. Infact it was like the difference from stubbing your toe and scraping your knee on a bike. I've been coughing alot though. Just getting all of that shit out of my lungs.


P.S. I posted this same exact think on the r/drugs subreddit, but someone told me about this subreddit, so I decided to post it here too.

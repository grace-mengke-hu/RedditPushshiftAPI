Suggestions Greatly Appreciated

Background Info:
Today is day fifteen for me. (I am not sure how I show that on my post sorry I am new to Reddit.) I quit when I left the state I live in to visit family up north. It has been easy for me quit here because my family doesn't smoke and I feel uncomfortable smoking around them. It is also super cold here so I don't want to go outside at all. On top of that packs are extremely expensive. So, its been easier not to smoke but I am concerned as soon as I get home I am going to relapse. A lot of my friends smoke and drink and if I am around them I want to smoke. Also, the freedom of being able to do whatever I want without people reminding me of consequences makes it easier to smoke.

Question:
Does anyone have advise on how to keep from smoking?
I want as many resources/tips/tricks as possible to keep me from smoking cigarettes.

Seasonal cravings are killing me

It's fall time here in Illinois. For God's sake I cannot stop thinking about walking around with a cup of coffee and some cigarettes. Lately I've been horribly depressed, frustrated, ill-tempered and sad. I'm just DOWN. I shared this Saturday that I got stir-crazy and had to leave my home/go to the grocery store -- where I then cried. This week I want to quit my job and and start smoking cigarettes again. This addiction is no joke, man. 

Right now I feel like something that was once inside of me is now dead and gone. I feel dead and gone, too. Now the seasonal change is causing me even more grief here and now. I wish I could stop all of this.

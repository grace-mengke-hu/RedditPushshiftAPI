Feeling constantly tired and less energetic now that I've stopped.

This is my first real attempt at quitting and I haven't smoked a cigarette in 25 days. The first week was probably the most difficult part. After that, it's gone pretty smoothly. I went from smoking close to 5-15 cigs to cold turkey.



In the time I haven't smoked, I've found that it's been extremely difficult for me to stay up later in the day. When I come home from work I feel more drained and mentally exhausted. My usual routine would be to smoke right after work and essentially smoke the day away depending on my schedule and stay up pretty late. 



Is this just a symptom of quitting and something I just have to get used to? Are there other quitters who've had to deal with this issue that can give me some insight? I feel like this feedback of loop of mental exhaustion has kept me in a state of being always tired.

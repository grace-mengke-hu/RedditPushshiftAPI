Just bought a pack after 8 months :(

I stopped smoking 8 months ago after 3 years of smoking a pack a day. For some reason today I really craved a cigarette so I picked up a pack of AS menthol lights. This is the 2nd time I've done this but the first time it was after 2 weeks of no cigarettes but the next day I threw the pack away and never smoked again till today.  I'm scared that I'm going to get addicted to cigarettes again :( idk what to do.

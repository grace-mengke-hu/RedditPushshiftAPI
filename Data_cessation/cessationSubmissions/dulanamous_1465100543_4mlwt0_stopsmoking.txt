Nicotine and Social Anxiety

It would appear that one of my biggest triggers when it comes to Nicotine is social anxiety. I love people. I love good conversatons. Yet anxiousness does set in when I am thrown into social situations and I automatically crave nicotine. Does any have any knowledge, experience, or advice on this problem?

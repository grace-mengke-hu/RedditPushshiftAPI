After many failed attempts at cold turkey, has anyone had success with weaning.

I've tried many times to quit smoking and it almost never works. I had someone tell me to try weaning off instead of going cold turkey. I was a pack a day smoker and every few days to a week I cut back a cigarette or two. I'm currently down to 11-12 per day instead of 20 per day after a week of weaning.

I've had some people argue that it doesn't matter if I don't stop completely. I feel somewhat accomplished because I never thought I could make this much progress.

I know that justifying a reason to smoke is just an excuse but some people make me feel like shit for not being able to go cold turkey.

Should I be proud of my progress or is it all really meaningless if I don't stop right now?

Is still smoking while cutting back to quit that bad?

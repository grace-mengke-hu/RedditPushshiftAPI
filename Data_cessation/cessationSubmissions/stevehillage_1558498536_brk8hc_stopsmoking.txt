Does nicotine make you feel any different?

I'd like to start of by saying that in my 12 years of using nicotine products I have never felt any different after having a cigarette or vaping.  With exception from the very occasional light-headedness which is definitely just from suffocation.

I feel like the act of smoking (or vaping now as I do not smoke cigarettes anymore) is the only part I'm hooked on.  When I'd quit weed I'd smoke cigs and vice-versa.

This may be an unpopular opinion but what if nicotine isn't even addictive?  What if that's the scam?  Where-as it used to be sold as a health product, it is now regarded as highly addictive but could that just be to fool people into thinking they need it?  If it doesn't make one feel any different at all?  Well at least not me.  How does it make you feel?

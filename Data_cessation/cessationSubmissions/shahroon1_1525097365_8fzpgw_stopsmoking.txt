recent quitter: hungry/thirsty with no sleep

hi,
I have just entered to my 2nd week into quitting after being a smoker for 11 years. I have a question from all successful and non-successful quitters.
Why am i hungry ALL the time. My appetite has significantly increased.  After 2-3 hours of a meal, i start feeling hungry. My appetite won't go away with something light .A candy or biscuits won't do. It has to be a proper wholesome meal. Same thing for fluids. I have increased water intake . I believe the hot weather has also a role to play in it. But i have not seen non-smokers around me gulping bottles.
Now to the second question. My sleep has also been affected. Usually, in my smoking days, i would fall asleep as soon i hit the bed.I would sleep like a child for 8 9 hours. Not anymore. Insomnia has hit me. I barely get 5 hours of sleep after lying for over 9 hours.
My anxiety and irritability is surprisingly controllable and nondescript. 
Can anyone explain what is going on.

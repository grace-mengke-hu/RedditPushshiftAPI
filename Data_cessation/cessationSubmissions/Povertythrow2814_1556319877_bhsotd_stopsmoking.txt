I’ve been scared straight

A year ago I realized I was an alcoholic and quit drinking. Part of that was going to AA meeting where everyone smoked and I picked up the habit again after smoking a little on and off since I was 18. I’m 37 now and have been a pack a day smoker for almost a year. In the last few days I’ve experienced discomfort in my right leg, and after some quick research I suspect it’s related to my circulation. 

This has freaked me out completely. I downloaded the smoke free app, threw away the rest of my pack, and bought a small vape pen just in case. I’m probably going to have to make an appointment with my doc, but my health insurance isn’t stellar because I’m just a waiter. 

I have so many more things I want to do with my life and I don’t want smoking to take those things away from me. Not one more drink. Not one more smoke. This is not how I want to die.

If you have any kind words for me, I could use them right now. Here’s looking forward to a better way of life

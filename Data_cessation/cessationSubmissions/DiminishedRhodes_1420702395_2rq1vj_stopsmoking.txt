A Month and Four Days

I quit smoking on December 4th 2014. It's now January 8th 2015 at 2:20 AM, and each day has been getting easier. I initially started quitting by using Chantix. Friend of mine got me a starter pack. I almost took the whole starter pack but stopped few days short because it was making me really depressed. As well as no matter how I took the pill my stomach was too upset for hours on end.

So from then on I stopped taking the pill and have been off the rest cold turkey. I'm excited to start gaining some stamina back and maybe more of an appetite. My unfortunate living arrangement has placed me with others where a couple people smoke cigarettes and weed in the next room adjacent to mine without any regards to myself quitting. 

I've never been one against pot in my life, as I used to be a big smoker back in my teens, but since quitting cigarettes and being around that lifestyle now after I quit has turned me against it.  Still I stay strong and don't feed into cravings but my only concern now is I have been having bad coughing fits for the past few days.

I do not have insurance and can't readily go to the doctor. I'm thinking that it's probably my lungs going into repair mode after 14 years of smoking. I'm so happy I don't smoke anymore and this is the longest I've ever gone and will continue to stay quit until my last days. 

Thanks for listening to my little story. At least people here will listen to me, as I don't really tell anyone in my life that I have quit because I've said it so many times in the past they are sure I will fail again.

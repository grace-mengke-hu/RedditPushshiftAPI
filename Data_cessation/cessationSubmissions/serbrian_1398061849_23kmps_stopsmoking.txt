Week Two: Smoking cessation is a process, not an event.

A lot has changed in the last 14 days, and things are definitely getting better.

Food and beverages taste fantastic (the way they should), and it turns out I'm a pretty good cook! I had a glass of wine last night and it tasted fantastic, even though it was more than a little trigger.

I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke - it makes me a little nauseous. I also noticed that I have a lot of clothes in my closet that need to be dry cleaned.

I'm still not sleeping through the night, but it has gotten to the point where I only wake up for a very short period and fall back to sleep again.

Yeah - there are still cravings, but they are nothing compared to the first 4 or 5 days of my quit. I know what they are, and I knew they'd be there... hell, there is no easy way to quit smoking. I can handle any of the little nicotine fits that get tossed my way.

Thanks again to everyone here who has shared their triumphs and struggles - this place has some great reading!

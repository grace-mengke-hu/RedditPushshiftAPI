How to stop smoking weed every day when the other people in the house smoke daily?

I live with two other people and I’ve been smoking weed everyday for about a year now and I can’t push myself to stop. If I lived alone I could manage it but I’m around two other people who smoke non stop and it’s so hard for me to snap out of the addiction :( anyone have any advice that will help me?

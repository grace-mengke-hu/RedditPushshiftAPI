The positive effects quitting smoking has on your body.

Hi guys,

I'm sure like me many of you enjoy going to the gym / playing sport but still smoke.

It's the stupidest fucking thing in the world isn't it?

- I'll wake up early
- I'll eat to give my body energy when I'm so tired eating makes me feel sick
- I'll take a train then a bus to get to the gym 
- train for 2 hours knowing I have 10-12 hours of work to do and that I'm going to be exhausted all day now.


Then  BAM !ðŸ’¥ as soon as I get out I light a fucking cigarette!

I've just gone to all that effort to make myself fitter and look better and that's how I cap it off?? 

So enough is enough after new year (3 days from now) I'm going to quit cold turkey.

I've decided that I'm going to make a video log of the ups & downs / the physical benefits as time goes on as a means to keep me motivated to stick to quitting as well as potentially inspire others to do the same.

I hope other people like this idea and make their own video logs and show people what amazing shape you can get into once you quit!

Good luck to all of you and happy new year!

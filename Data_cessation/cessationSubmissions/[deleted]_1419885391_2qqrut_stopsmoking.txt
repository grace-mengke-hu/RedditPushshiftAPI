Trying again after accidentally picking it up again after quitting for two years.

I picked up smoking in September/October of 2007, and had my last cigarette on February 16th of 2012, and did just fine. I was 7 weeks pregnant. For being a pack a day smoker for nearly 4.5 years, it was really the memory of the first cigarette in the morning with a cup of coffee that bothered me.

Fast forward to current day. I am very much an extrovert, and any time my wonderful daughter is at her father's house, I feel an itch to go out. I have anxiety, but I'm not really a drinker; I feel an urge to do something with my hands. I found myself smoking 4-10 cigarettes a day. I started with cloves, just one or two a day because they "don't smell gross." It's almost like I was in denial of it, it's been a daily thing since August, and I didn't even realize it. I went to my OBGYN to get an IUD and she asked me "are you a smoker?" and I said "no," she then asked again "are you SURE you're not a smoker?" I was confused by that, but in hind sight she could probably smell that nasty stale smell that all smokers carry around with them. 
I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days, and I want to kill everything, but it is easier than the first time I quit. 


I know going out will be a huge trigger for me, so I'm scared to, but I hate not going out. I feel trapped and anxious. What should I do?

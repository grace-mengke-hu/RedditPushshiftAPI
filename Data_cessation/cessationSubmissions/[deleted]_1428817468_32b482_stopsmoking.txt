Day 1 of a deal made with myself - 5000 steps = 1 smoke

I've heard the figure '10,000 steps' being quoted as a healthy amount to walk each day - at least as a minimum. So, I'm hoping to use that as an incentive to both quit and become fit.

To that end, I've picked up a nifty little pedometer. 

At this rate, if I'm walking a healthy amount, I'll smoke twice in a day. If I want a third, fourth, whatever, I'll have to walk another 5000 steps before I'm allowed to take another from the pack (my roommate is helping me enforce this).

Steps don't roll over from day to day. 

Once I finish this pack, I'll increase the required amount of walking by 1000 steps. Each new pack will be an increase of 1000 as well. 

Eventually, each individual cigarette will require more steps than I could hope to complete in a day, and I'll be forced to quit - if I haven't quit naturally by then.

Today I went for a little over 12,400 steps. I've already smoked once today, and I'll probably be enjoying the second just after this post. Halfway to my third... but I don't feel like walking much more today, so I guess I won't be getting it.

I guess I'm just putting this here as a reminder to myself. This way it won't be written on a piece of paper that I can *accidentally* throw away, or stored in my brain where I can *conveniently* forget it.

Should I try to ease off, or quit cold turkey?

I have been a pack a day smoker since I was about 14, and I turn 19 pretty soon. I want to quit before I do any more serious harm to myself or get too old to recover. So should I ween myself or just go cold turkey and test my will power? Any other advice would be appreciated too.

One of my favorite excerpts from Allen Carr's book

"Start watching smokers, particularly in situations where they are not allowed to smoke.  You'll find that they have their hands near their mouths, or they are twiddling their thumbs, or tapping their feet, or fiddling with their hair, or clenching their jaw and grinding their teeth.  Smokers aren't relaxed.  They've forgotten what it feels like to be completely relaxed"

The reason it's one of my favorites, is because I am currently inside not allowed to smoke, and doing all of the above while I was reading it haha.  This guy is dead on, never knew a book could help quit cigarettes more than anything else.

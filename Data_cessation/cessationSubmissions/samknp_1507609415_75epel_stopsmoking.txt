28 days Magic

Hi ... today on 22nd day ...heard that if one can go smokefree for 28 days there is 55% possibility for him to become smokefree .... Hope i will do it 100% this time as leaving after 22 years with around 14-15 smoke a day in average ...Its cold turkey without any NRT ... using normal gums to keep my mouth busy

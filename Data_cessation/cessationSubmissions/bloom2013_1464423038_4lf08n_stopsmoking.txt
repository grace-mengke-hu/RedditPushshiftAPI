Tonight was reaaally hard

I was horribly irritable and obnoxious today, like I had a fight with everyone in my head while smiling at people as they talked to me. Then I went out, I danced, I drank. The nightclub was so hot and crowded I kept hoping my friends would want to smoke just to go outside for a beak. They didn't so I ended up going outside by myself, and I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe I could sneak a puff or two and no one would ever know... As if, ha.
I didn't, though. But what an exhausting day. It's like all I did today was actively *not* smoke... Full time job.

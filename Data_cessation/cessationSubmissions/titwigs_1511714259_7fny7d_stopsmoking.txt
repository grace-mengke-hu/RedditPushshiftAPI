Ooh yay! 202 days!

I missed my 200-day milestone, can't believe I've actually made it this far. I feel fantastic! I've been buying my kids' Christmas presents and I'm like, shit, look what I can afford! I renovated my bathroom. I've started drinking water every day and my skin is soooo much better now. I'm way more patient with the kids and I have so much more energy, I even feel like my anxiety is going away (although I am on Zoloft lol). My mum told me I'm like an entirely different person, and I really feel like one! Moral of the story: nothing bad can come from stopping smoking, only good things, and we're all awesome for breaking free of this horrible addiction! :D

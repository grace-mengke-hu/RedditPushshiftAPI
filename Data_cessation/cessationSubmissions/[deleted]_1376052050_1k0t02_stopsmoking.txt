Using gum and scented lotion to kick my habit

I've found that chewing gum and applying a scented hand lotion is helpful for me when trying to resist a craving. The gum gives my mouth something to do, the lotion keeps my hands busy and a bit slippery so I would struggle to roll a cigarette and the scent is nice to remind me how stinky and gross my hands would smell if I did light up.

Is anyone else trying a new habit?

Day #2 now

Hey guys, (sorry for my english it is not my language) 

Yesterday was my first day and I tried to quit cigs. I was scared of a day at work because it's only smokers and not smokers but no ex-smoker so nobody can help me if the cravings are hard. I tried so many time to quit but when I go to work that seems impossible to me. I tried something simple : when I need a cig I walk 5 minutes in the streets. At the end of the day at work, I smoked : 0 cigs.

We went to a pub and I drink alcohol and I smoked 6 cigs since that moment.

I think said like that it can be see like a failure. But for me this is awesome. I can handle a day at work now and I have see that alcohol is a bad things when you try to quit so I will not go in a pub soon to avoid this situation. It's important to learn with our experience! 

And 6 cigs is awesome. I smoked between 25 and 40 cigs per day since 12 years. That represent nearly 131 400 cigs... This number is so huge... 

So guys stay positives and for me day 2 will be 0 cigs. 
I feel it, I can do it, you can do it too. 
Quit this addiction is the best decision of our lives! 
Cheer up and keep it up guys!

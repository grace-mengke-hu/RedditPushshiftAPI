My whole office reeks of cigarette smoke

And I don't understand why, because there were only 3 people here who smoke and 2 of them aren't here today. The other one came in late and I smelled it before she even got here. I think we have a closet smoker on our hands! 

The point of this is a) I can smell EVERYTHING and b) stale cigarette smoke smells disgusting. Add that to your reasons to quit - You smell bad. Like, really, really bad.

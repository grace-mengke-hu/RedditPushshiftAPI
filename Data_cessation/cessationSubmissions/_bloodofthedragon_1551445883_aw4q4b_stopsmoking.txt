Update... I posted about how my craving for cigarettes makes me an asshole.

I made it one day!!!! I made a jerk comment about something, and I immediately apologized and said I am quitting Smoking, so please excuse me. I didn’t escalate or get into any stupid arguments! 

Now that I know it’s a trigger for me, I can be more aware. It’s day 2, I’m going to finish this day!

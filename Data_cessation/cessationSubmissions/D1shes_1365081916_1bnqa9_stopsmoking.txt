I want to, but I really dont..

I've been smoking since I was 17. I'm 21 now and in a very serious relationship. She wants me to quit smoking, but truthfully I'm not completely sure I want to. I enjoy smoking. But for her sake I've been really trying to quit. The biggest hurdle for me is my lack of desire to quit. I've easily gone 2+ weeks without smoking simply because I wanted to see if I was addicted or not.
I've tried the electronic cigarettes, but I dont get the same satisfaction that I do from watching a real cigarette burn down to the filter. It feels rewarding somehow to smoke the entire thing down to nothing.

I know my health is at risk, but it doesn't matter to me i guess.

I can do this .

So, i am just 22 years old and already smoking that damn tobacco for over 6 years now.
I also like to smoke weed, this was for years one of the problems why i could not stop smoking at all.
Every time i got that nicotine low, i just rolled a joint with tobacco and everything was fine. But on that way, i would never really quit smoking.
Now i am just smoking pure weed when i am at home and no tobacco at all, except when smoking joints with friends. (It's very common to smoke joints with tobacco here in germany, so you wont find a single person who smokes pure. So on the weekends i will still smoke some tobacco, because of the social aspect of smoking a joint with friends.)

The main reason i want to stop smoking is because my mum started smoking again, after she realized i started smoking. She quit smoking when i was about 8 years old, started again 8 years later and is now smoking more then ever.
The problem is that she allowed me to just smoke from here packs, so basically i have free cigarettes in the living room, the kitchen and the bath all the time.
After that i smoked a whole lot more. Now this needs to stop, i hope i can do it.
The last motivation i needed to finally try it again was this subreddit, so thanks for everyone who participating here. :)

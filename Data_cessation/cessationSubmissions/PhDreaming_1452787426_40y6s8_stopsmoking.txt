I'm in One-derland! Officially hit one year smoke-free today!!

I would be remiss if I didnâ€™t start this post off with a HUGE thank you to the people of this sub who have provided such a wonderful support system over the past 12 months, I genuinely credit my participation here for my success.  

Please help me celebrate today by doing something kind for yourself... treat yourself to a fancy coffee, buy a bouquet of flowers, go out for dinner, read a book, take an extra-long shower or bath, hug your pet, whatever makes you happy... we are all doing an incredible thing here, kicking this addiction, and that is something to be celebrated!!

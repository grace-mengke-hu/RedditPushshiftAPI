1st "rage" since quitting and today is the start of Lent

I posted yesterday that I was having absolutely horrendous cravings. I know the trigger wasn't even so much nicotine as stress from some of the recent events. However, one thing people have noticed since I've quit is that I never really went through the angry, yelling, pain in the ass stage . . . until yesterday.

My daughter came in and I asked a question. She didn't really answer (FYI, she is EXTREMELY shy and when feels put on the spot, goes silent). I lost it. I screamed in a way I have not screamed in years. It was as if someone took the top of every single feeling I had and threw them out at the first thing in my way. 

I felt horrible . . . .  .

We ended up talking. She was fine since I didn't resort to name calling or anything, just screaming. She said the plus of living in a house full of hormonal females is that outbursts are almost expected. But still . . . sigh. I was the mom who yelled when they were little. I worked hard over the years to find better ways to communicate and get things done. 

The good news is that my friend was over the other day and left cigarettes. I didn't realize this until I found them yesterday. I saw them, went to the sink, drowned them and threw them away. My outbursts made me realize I want to continue moving forward as I quit and not backwards. I never want to deal with withdrawals again. 

My other daughter came up to me before she went to bed and said she was proud that I didn't smoke and that my skin looks so much better. That made me happy. :) 

And Lent starts today. No alcohol or soda. I'll be okay with the alcohol way more than the soda, lol. Drinking a lot of coffee and water today. 

So, I'll find the positive and remember how bad w/d's felt yesterday and remember how desperately I never want to experience them again. :)

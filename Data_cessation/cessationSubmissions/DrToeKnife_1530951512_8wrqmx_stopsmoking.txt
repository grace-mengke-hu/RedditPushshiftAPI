Relapse on day 12. Here's my observations.

As hard as the first four days are (physical cravings). The hard part is remembering why you quit because once you get past a week your new energy and confidence starts to fade into normality and it becomes a test of trusting that your current state is far better than your old one.

I had a lot more energy, I was more confident, and I had more endurance. My favorite benefit was that sex with my girlfriend was way better. For her and me. It felt better and I was able to get into it more. Cigarettes dull your passion for the good things in life. 

Stopping successfully means to change your habits and to truly commit to being deliberate and mindful in your positive actions.

Starting over on Monday. Good luck y'all. We can do it!

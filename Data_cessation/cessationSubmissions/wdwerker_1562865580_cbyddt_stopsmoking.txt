Quit 20 years ago !

I started at 15, typical peer pressure and trying to fit in. Never a heavy smoker, usually less than a pack a day. Smoked for 25 years until I read an article about a tobacco company president.  Someone released an internal memo he sent to the advertising department complaining about expenses. Said your job is to hook new smokers or steal them from another brand cause once we’ve got them we’ve got them for life ! Reading that pissed me off so much I quit cold turkey right then. Next few weeks were rough but I hung on sustained by my anger . Being around other smokers became difficult trying to resist temptation but then it became avoiding the smell and I knew I had a grip on it. Then my sense of smell became much better and foods started tasting better too.  So hang in there and use whatever motivation and help you need . Maybe they just need to pass a bill that raises the age to buy tobacco every year until you have to be 35 to buy a pack of smokes ? Just stumbled across this subreddit on someone’s profile and thought I should add my support. There is a physical addiction as well as a mental component. I had support from friends and family since most of them didn’t smoke.

It gets better!

This is a throwaway because I'm about to talk about something slightly embarrassing. This is an issue that really affected me when quitting, and I couldn't find many resources to help because of its taboo nature.

Though I haven't had a cigarette in 23 days and feel great, I didn't always feel this way. The first couple of weeks are tough for a myriad of reasons but, for me, the hardest part is the constipation (pun intended). There is just something about not being able to shit that makes you feel so, so weird. As a smoker, the first shit of the day comes after the first cigarette, so quitting smoking can often mean not pooping for days. It gets better though! 

Everything is awesome now and my poops are better than they've ever been. As a smoker, I almost always had the "shits." Now everything is solid and healthy and great. It's one of those activities where you really have to face the fact that you've been poisoning yourself for many years. Once the poison is out of you, your body starts to function normally. 

Just push past it (though don't strain yourself), stay off the laxatives, drink tons of water (and maybe some prune juice), and be patient! Your body won't just return to normal â€“ it will get better!

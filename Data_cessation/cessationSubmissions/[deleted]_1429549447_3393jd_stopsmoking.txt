I'm on my third day and struggling.

So the last time I smoked was Friday evening.

Today I'm really struggling, not only am I craving a hell of a lot, I'm also insanely fatigued and unmotivated.

The problem is, I work from home, I have a ton of work to do and I can hardly keep my eyes open.

How can I keep myself awake and not craving!?

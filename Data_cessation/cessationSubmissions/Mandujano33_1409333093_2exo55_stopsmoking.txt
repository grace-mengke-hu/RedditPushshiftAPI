thank you for your support! even the badge system it's awesome and motivates to keep the flow on a supporting community... i haven't cravings and also stop dreaming about smokes, now it's time to go a bar.. last week i play like 30 minutes in a smoke area of a casino.. and the smell was bad, made me glad i quit..

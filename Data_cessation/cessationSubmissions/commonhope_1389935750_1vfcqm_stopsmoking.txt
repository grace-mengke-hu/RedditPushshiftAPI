440th day quit, First visit in a looong time.

This subreddit right here, has helped me quit one of the most addictive substances known to man, and I want to give a huge shout-out to the Mods and participants for helping it exist.  I have to admit, I don't completely deserve my 440 day badge as I do remember a wasted occasion or two where I dragged once off a friend's smoke. The important thing, though, is that I haven't been a smoker since I got my badge on this subreddit. I no longer associate mornings, coffee, meals, sex, or long waiting periods with smoking, and I've saved probably hundreds of dollars in lieu of the 7+ cigarettes daily habit for 6 years solid. I still have a lot of work to do to get the cravings to stop while I'm drunk or in social settings, but overall, I've replaced smoking with some awfully healthy habits and I can vouch whole-heartedly for the intense physical and emotional benefits that come along with the new lifestyle. Please continue on your goals, quitters; love yourself, learn patience, and use this opportunity to become a better you in general.  Peace!

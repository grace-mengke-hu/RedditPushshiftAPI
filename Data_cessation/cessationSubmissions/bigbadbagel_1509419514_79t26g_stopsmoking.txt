Need help

Hello, I started out as a social smoker 5 years ago, then it slowly progressed. Now ive been addicted for a year and ive been tryin to quit everyday for the past 2 months. Everytime its like "fuck it, ill start tommorrow", and tommorrow never comes. So I was wondering what are some things that you tell yourself to get through the cravings? Thank you in advance.

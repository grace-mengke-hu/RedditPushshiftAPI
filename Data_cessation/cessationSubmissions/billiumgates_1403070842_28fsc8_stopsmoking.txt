Does the Craving Ever Stop?

I've been dipping for 6 years.  I didn't even plan to stop because I knew that if I planned to quit I'd always do it next week.  I started trying to "cut back" and after about 3 weeks of that I just stopped dipping altogether.  It's been two weeks now but the craving is still very strong.  I can deal with it, but I'm just wondering if the craving stops at some point.  My trigger is drinking alcohol.

Breaking the habit gets easier every time

The biggest hurdle for me is smoking while drinking. It is just so soothing, calming, and delicious, it seemed hard to give up. It is also what broke me the other time I quit, I just couldn't resist.

This time I very consciously fought the urge to bring cigarettes to a party, even when others were smoking I grabbed myself by the collar and didn't ask for one. The day after I felt amazing. It's like the weights have been lifted off my shoulders. The next party I went to the urge to smoke was almost gone, it was easy to ignore and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders in general. Feels great.

1 month today

Probably wouldn't have lasted this long without Nicorette, but I've been able to convince myself to chew the gum each time instead of doing what I really want.  Drinking less has really helped too, because those were the times when I'd say "fuck it".

Cheers and good luck to my fellow non-smokers 

[Edit]  I just messaged the bot.  April 5th, 2013 was the date I had my last.  

[Edit 2]  Apparently that was only 28 days :(  ... Shit.  I read 03/05/2013 as May 5th.  I don't know what day it is, sorry

Letting go

Today is the day. After 22 years of smoking, recently more than a pack a day, it is time to banish these sticks of evil. I've been lurking here a while, and today I have requested my badge. With the help and support here and via Smoke Free Beta, and some assistance with a low nicotine esmoke, here's hoping I have broken free at long last!

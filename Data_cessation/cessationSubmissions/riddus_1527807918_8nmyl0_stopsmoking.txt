It’s hard without support...

I’ve been wanting to quit smoking for a long time. I’ve made several attempts with varying degrees of success. So, after a week of doing it “the right way”, making a plan, setting a date, identifying triggers, etc. today I made the leap. I did this all quietly, without telling anybody my plan. 

It’s been a rough 12 hours so far, and apparently it must have shown when I got home because my wife asks why I am so irritable. When I tell her I haven’t smoked all day she goes off on me about how SHE isn’t ready to quit, that I’m only doing this to make her feel bad, yadayadayada. I try to explain this isn’t about her, that I want to feel better for me. I’m still a bad guy. 

It’s really hard right now not to go have one...or ten.

Well, I am going back to smoking

I quit for 6 months...but I cannot cope with life without cigarettes. I am living a very stressful time and need to get my ass working and cigarettes is the least of my problems. I suffer from social anxiety, social phobia and it was nice quitting but things in life did not turn the way I wanted them. You have all been amazing and hopefully I will quit smoking again once there is more stability in my life and I find  a purpose again....surely I will be back. No need to comment, I am just posting this to save it for myself so I know the date i started smoking again. I quit for 184 days.

Why so many duplicate posts here?

In the past few weeks I've noticed a good number of posts, posted multiple times. I assume that the poster has some reason to think the post didn't go through, so they do it again, and again.

I don't know what the problem is, but please check and delete any duplicates of your posts. That will help everyone's posts to be seen.

Tomorrow will be the day.

I had originally quit before and was smoke free for three months, however I ended up in a very stressful and toxic part of my life (I ended up being put back on antidepressants)and picked it back up again. When I first quit, something in my brain just went enough. And now it's happening again. I'm posting here because I'm not going to tell my friends as of yet for obvious friends.

What are some things you guys do to get through the cravings?

I wish you all the best on your journeys.

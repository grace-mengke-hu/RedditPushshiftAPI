This time will be different. But I need advice!

I've quit smoking twice- both times for about 90 days. Any insight as to why the 3 month mark seems to get me every time? Other than being stupid, I think it's because in my head I think the smokes don't have any control anymore. That, in turn, led me to think it was okay to have one here and there. I think recognizing that problem will be the key to staying successfully quit this time around. Any other helpful advice on staying quit while thinking you're "in the clear"? I've smoked for 4 years, so I want to quit now before I get stuck in the endless cycle.

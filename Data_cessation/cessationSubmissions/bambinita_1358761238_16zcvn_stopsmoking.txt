A question for all you 100+ days non-smokers

I see quite a few people here who stopped smoking 3, 4 months, even a year ago and they are still on this subreddit.

Why?

I mean it is my day 6 now being smoke free and I still think about cigarettes a lot of time. But I imagine the quantity of thoughts spent on cigarettes should decrease in time, so hopefully when I pass one month I will be free.

And then I don't want to spend ANY time thinking about cigarettes, smoking, nothing connected to it. Just want to live my life as a regular nonsmoker.

And seeing you still here makes me wonder if that is possible. I mean what is someone who has been 300 days smoke free doing here? Is it just to support potential nonsmokers, or are you guys also gaining something from being here? And if yes, what exactly?

Cause frankly, you are scaring the shit out of me. I don't want to be thinking about cigarettes after all that time.

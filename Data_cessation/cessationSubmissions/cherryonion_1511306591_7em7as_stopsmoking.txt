1000 DAYS!

I've just hit my one thousandth day of not smoking! I owe a lot to all of you and this sub for being a great source of inspiration and a great outlet for my thoughts / feelings! 

To everyone at day 1, or 10, or 100; NEVER GIVE UP! I remember going through very easy patches, followed by tough intervals, and then back and fourth; all the way up to 1 year! You are all going through a personal battle that I KNOW you can get through! Absolutely if I can get through it, YOU CAN! So I'd like to cheers for my 1000 days, and for all the quitters who will also eventually hit their 1000 days!

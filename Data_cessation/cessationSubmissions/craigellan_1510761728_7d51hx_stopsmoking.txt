Day 2, 36 hours smoke free, and I feel awful.

Day 2 is a lot harder than day 1.  Couldn't sleep last night and feel like I have the flu today, just no energy and a general feeling of crap.  Im not going to cave in and smoke, I 100% wont!  Just needed to come here and vent.  Here's hoping day 3 and onward is easier.

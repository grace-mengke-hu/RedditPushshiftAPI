3d 18h 20m free

The time has come, i am free of smoking (hopefully) 

Its been a hard couple of days and some would say that 3 days is not hard, but for me it was a massive milestone. Thank you for your own views that you post on reddit and the support we give each other is more than enough to help me quit for good.

If you cant stop now, you wont ever stop.

Keep on keeping on !

A Milestone w/Bonus Good Vibes

Today marks 2 weeks! I haven't poisoned my body in 2 weeks! I've already noticed more endurance when I'm lifting weights, and I've even started cardio! 

Now for the extra encouragement. Today I stopped at my local gas station. I'm a regular there and I live in a small town so all of the cashiers know me. As I was checking out, the cashier asked if I needed anything else. I told him I was all set and he asked "no smokes today?" I proudly told him I quit 2 weeks ago today and he congratulated me and said he was proud. One of the other cashiers had even said "I wish I could quit. Good job."

This just goes to show that most people truly don't enjoy smoking and it's really an addiction like any other substance. There are many people on this sub that have quit or are trying to quit. Others are lurking just waiting for that moment. You can do it! I promise that you will be so proud of yourself and the only thing you're "giving up" is an unhealthy lifestyle. Keep pushing and thank you to everyone in this sub who has encouraged me so far!

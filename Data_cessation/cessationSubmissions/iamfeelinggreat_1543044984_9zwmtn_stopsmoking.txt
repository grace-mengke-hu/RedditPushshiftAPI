7 Fucking days.......I did it....

 

## Going Cold Turkey Today (Cig &amp; Coffee)

I have to quit smoking now. I am smoking more than a 20-25 pcs a day. I need to buy a pack every day. I also drink around 7-8 cups of black coffee (Don't know its good or bad).

It has been 7 hours already plus the 2 hours of napping. So any tips and advice ???

That was my Old post 13 days ago...Snapped it and smoked again for next 5-6 days..Then I gave a big thought to my self...watched around 5-6 hours of not smoking content on youtube..........Started it again last week..didn't go to buy any cigrattes...now 7 days sober... I have given a lot of thought about it...The money I have wasted ... I got my x-ray reports and I am horrified...Had unusual chest pain last week.. I don't know if i would have quit if i was smoking 3-4 cigs a day..but 20-25 is huge(not a trump fanboy) :D . SO 7 Days and Now, Nothing big but definitely a better path.. Thanks to everyone who read it... Hope to share you in future.

1 cigarette a day

Joined Reddit today to post this. It's been bothering me for awhile.
I'm young - 19 - and started smoking at 16. I started at 4-5 cigarettes/day, plus unlimited smoking when drinking or going out. At 17 I dropped that to 3, limiting myself to 5 when drinking (obviously, this was sometimes broken). At 18, I dropped that to 1 a day, and have stuck to it, with some phases of smoking 2 a day (usually when I go out), and some nights of 3-4 if out drinking.

There is so little research on the effects of smoking this few cigarettes. All there is is that one Norwegian study. I'm so torn - I love my cigarettes; it's such an enjoyable pleasure for me. Maybe it's that I'm still young, or it's few enough, but I don't feel that I experience many adverse effects cardiovascular or health-wise. However, I hate that I can't go a day without a cigarette (horrible cravings by 5pm), that I'm hurting some friends and family, that I smell, ... and I know it IS damaging my health to an extent.

Is it worth trying to quit? Are others in the same boat? Can anyone relate? There's definitely a part of me that wants to, but a HUGE part of me that really doesn't want to face that challenge and lose my daily pleasure!

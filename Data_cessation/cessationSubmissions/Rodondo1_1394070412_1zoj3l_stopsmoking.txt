One Month

Biggest milestone yet. Although I'm currently in a conflict. I've stopped smoking cigarettes, but I'm still taking in nicotine with my vaporiser. Should I be worried about being dependent on nicotine? Who knows. I'm going to cut the dosage down till I'm eventually free of it altogether :D

I am out.

I've seen my health get worse over these last two years, in particular now needing the use of inhalers, as well as frequent chest infections. I've been a smoker for two and a half years, but for the past month I have increasingly mulled over the idea of quitting.

Yesterday I had no plans to quit, except for thinking "I'll do it soon". However, today after my first cigarette in the morning, I was hit with a moment of clarity where I saw that the problems with my health just aren't worth those puffs. And so it begins. Allen Carr's Easyway seems to be quite popular and I've started reading it now.

Would be grateful for any tips from anyone for someone who's just begun.

Let's do this.

Edit: Got to second chapter in Allen Carr's book and he recommends continuing smoking until you've finished the book? Anyone recommend this too?

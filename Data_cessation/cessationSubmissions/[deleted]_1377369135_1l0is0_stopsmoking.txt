Turning my habits around

Hi there :)  I decided to take quitting seriously a few days ago, and since then I've gone 3 work shifts and 2 loooong drives without a smoke!  This is something I haven't been able to do for years.  Sometimes when I've had cravings I read through this sub, and you guys have helped me a lot!  

Today I had a HUGE little victory - I couldn't shake the thought of walking to the store for a pack.  I wanted to!  Instead, I went for a run.  This is something I NEVER would have done as a smoker.  I'm hoping the tobacco-free me will be a runner. :)  One of my biggest motivations in continuing my quit indefinitely is to see how my body heals itself and grows stronger without the effects of smoke and chemicals 4-12x a day.   

Just wanted to share and introduce myself a little!  Just requested my badge, and I gotta say, all of you with 100+ day badges are a HUGE inspiration to me!

The patch and sleep?

I’m quitting in a few days for something like the hundredth time. I’ve read everywhere that the patch is so beneficial to actually quitting, but have also read that it can screw with sleep and cause odd dreams. 

I’m in college so my sleep schedule is already screwed and I don’t sleep through the night as is. I’d like to not worsen this, but I need to quit. Just wondering what all of your experiences have been with this. Thanks

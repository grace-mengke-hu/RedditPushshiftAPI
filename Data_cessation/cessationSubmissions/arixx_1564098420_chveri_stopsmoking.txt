Wondering if someone else has used vaping to quit smoking. I have questions I'd love some help with.

Pack and a maybe three to four cigs a day smoker. I'm really trying to quit. I've banned myself from smoking in my car and cleaned it out, deodorized it, etc.

It's been about a week since that. I smoke quite a bit when driving, so that was a big milestone for me.

I purchased a myBlu vape with 2.4% nicotine pods. I know that the delivery of nicotine in this way is a hell of a lot stronger, so I limited my intake as much as possible and it seems to be working as a replacement for cigs.

My end goal is to quit the nicotine all together by slowly reducing my intake. Yes, I know, just quit all together. That hasn't worked for me. I wish it did.

My question for any of you peeps that used any form of vape... I know how to refill this device so I don't have to buy new pods, but there is pretty zero information, or if it's given, it's expected that you already know XYZ. 

I've read that some things don't with some mixes of vape juice, but I can't find any friggin' info. 

Sure, the pods are cheaper than cigs, but I'd like to be cheaper and refill the things. 

Eventually, I'll go to 0% nicotine and just walk around outside for 5-10min. Then I'll toss it away.

That's the plan anyway.

Many thanks for the input and any help you guys can provide!

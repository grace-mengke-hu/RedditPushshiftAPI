Made it through first serious craving

I had a horrible day at work today. For real, I'd like to put into words what happened, but as a nurse I can't. But the thing is, when I had my morning coffee around 1130am, I wanted nothing more than to ask a cigarette off of my coworker, who was sitting next to me, smoking.  
But I remembered what I read here. One cigarette means I might just as well buy another pack. And that cigarette wouldn't solve my problem. So I didn't, had another coffee, and didn't ask for a cigarette. Made it! My 11 day streak isn't broken!

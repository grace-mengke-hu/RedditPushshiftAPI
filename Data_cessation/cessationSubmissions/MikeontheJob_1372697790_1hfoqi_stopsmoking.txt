Awwwww-yeah.  Loving it. 

* My heart isn't racing at night anymore.  
* I can smell both amazing and disgusting scents.  
* I don't stink anymore. 
* Food tastes amazing (I've gained 10 pounds :/ ).
* Hiking in the woods has a new dimension added to it (scent).
* I have saved $170 so far.
* I am not fatigued all the time.  I actually feel awake in the morning.
* I do not feel like an outcast to society.
* I am generally much happier!

Don't waste another moment, quit today.

Big weekend victory

I am on day 19 smoke free.. Doing pretty well, but honestly I have no social life and have been alone (smoking partner out of country, few friends, unemployed with little stress etc etc.)

I went out on Friday night with a friend and a big group of her friends- 10 in total. First stop of the night was an outside cafe for pre drinks.. I immediately noted that every single person was a smoker. I got nervous..

We went to dinner and there was times I was suddenly the person that I always felt sorry for- the nonsmoker who sat alone while everyone too smoke breaks between courses.. I was craving but doing okay.. 

Then after a long and boozy dinner we went to a bar- a great dirty dive bar where you can smoke. I like this bar. But I didn't want to crack and smoke.. The rest of the night I alternated between wanting to snatch someone's cigarette and take a deep long satisfying drag, and also escaping to find fresh air because my head was pounding.. 

I posted in /r/tifu about the stupid thing I did when I got home. Enjoy my drunken stupidity. But feeling strong about my quit. Yay!

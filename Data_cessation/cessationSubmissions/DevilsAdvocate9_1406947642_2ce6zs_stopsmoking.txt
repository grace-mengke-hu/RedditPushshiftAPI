Radiation

I have been thinking about quitting smoking for a while now. Probably the most hilarious, though effective, deterrent to my smoking happened recently.

 I was learning about the radiological effects of various things when my instructor asked, "Who smokes a lot?" Immediately everyone shouted my name. I walk up to the front and a Gieger-counter is placed near my chest - 20,000. Obviously it was a prank but there and then my best friend threw away her pack of cigarettes. So, I guess this is kind of a funny way that helped me out. Take what you will from it.

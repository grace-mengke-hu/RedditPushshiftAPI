Making another run at it!

Hey all!  Just figured I'd stop by and let you know that I'm smoke free for about 66 minutes now.  I'm on a work trip for the next week and then my closest smoking buddy is on a trip of his own after that, so I figured it's a good time to get a head start on it.  I'm pretty optimistic right now, but I'm sure that'll change in a few hours :P  I guess I was just hoping for some advice/encouragement from you guys before I get started.  Thanks!

Quitting while on stimulants?

Hey y’all!
I’m a serial quitter and I want to try again. However, I’m prescribed Vyvanse for my adult ADD and I don’t know if anyone else can relate, but I CHAIN smoke while on stimulants. Not only that, but cigarettes just...taste/feel so good. If I don’t take my medicine for a couple days, I’ll maybe smoke one cigarette. The craving is barely there. I’m committed to staying on these meds until I’m done with school so I’m wondering if anyone has had experience with quitting while the sweet beckoning of stimulants is in the back of your mind at all times?
Thanks!!

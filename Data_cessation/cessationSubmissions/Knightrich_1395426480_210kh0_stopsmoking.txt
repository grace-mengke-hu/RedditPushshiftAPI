I need to quit, but I don't know where to begin.

I've smoked for around two and a half years, quite heavily. I enjoy it for the social aspects, I've met lots of interesting people and had many interesting conversations from smoking at gigs and similar events and I sometimes find myself chain smoking constant cigs because someone else will come out to smoke and I'll want to speak to them. It doesn't help that I smoke regularly at work because I work in an under-populated pub and take smoke breaks often to break the monotony.

My friend who has smoked for 5 or 6 years got mad at me at a gig because I smoke too much and "he doesn't want to see me die early" and I joked and said it was fine where in reality it hit me hard.

I'm asthmatic and quite overweight with a family history of diabetes and heart issues, which should be enough to convince me to quit but it's such a strong habit with me that even the thought of quitting makes me anxious and scared because I enjoy the social aspect so much.

I've quit for a month a while ago and it was relatively easy, I didn't use patches or electronic cigarettes or any other aides other than some willpower that appeared from nowhere. I some joints quite regularly and I was smoking them during that month which really wouldn't help, but eventually I convinced myself that one cig wouldn't hurt and before I knew it I was back in the habit.

I really don't know what to do about it, and I'm turning to you guys for inspiration out of desperation. Should I go to the doctor and ask for assistance or what? 

I feel kinda pathetic doing this but I'm finally admitting that I have a problem. Thanks in advance.

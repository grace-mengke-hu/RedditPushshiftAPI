why is smoking the hardest???

I mean, I've quit everything else:

- coke
- alcohol
- weed
- masturbion
- random sex

still, I keep bouncing back to cigs. its redicoulous. youd think all those other habits would be a problem...

I'm in the process of quitting all unhealthy habits, but those smokes have such a tight grip. can anybody else relate??

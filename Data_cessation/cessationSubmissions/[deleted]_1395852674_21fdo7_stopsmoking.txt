17 with asthma quitting after almost 2 years.

So yeah... I've got asthma. Yesterday I decided that I wanted to stop smoking, because of a really sweet & cute girl that I've been dating. Nevertheless, today I got drunk, merely because I was in too much of a need for that single smoke...  
I'm not worried about my lungs, but my relationship with this girl (whom btw doesn't smoke).  
You can comment whatever you want, I just felt the urge to share my story. Peace out!

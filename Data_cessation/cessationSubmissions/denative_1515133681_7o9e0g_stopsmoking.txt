Day 4

I have been smoking for 13 years. Since I was 14. Since before I started getting my period. A cigarette is like my blankie. It is my comfort. It is all I know. And I haven’t smoked one since New Year’s Eve. 

The first 2 days were raw and brutal. Instead of going for the gum or a patch, I got a vape. The juice I got has a low dose of nicotine to keep the edge off, and I feel great. 

Some people have told me that it’s cheating, but for me, I feel a huge sense of accomplishment. I’ve never gone this long without a cigarette since my first drag. 

Just want to reach out to others who are becoming nonsmokers through the help of Vaping and let you know that I am proud of you! 

Edit: I am proud of ALL of you, no matter your way of quitting.

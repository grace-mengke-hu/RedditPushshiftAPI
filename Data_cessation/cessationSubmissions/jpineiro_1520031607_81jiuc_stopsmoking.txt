I´m gonna stop this NOW

Hi reddit,

Started smoking when arrived college at the age of 18, now, 2 weeks to graduate, and after more than 50 attempts, I decided to quit. Started like everyone, 1 or 2 cigarretes per day, but lately I was smoking 30(or even more). This scalated quickly, so needs to stop.

I don´t want to tell anyone of my friends or family cause I also think about this like a surprise to them, so I share it with you.

Cheers and good luck to all. Let´s fucking ruin the tobaco companies!

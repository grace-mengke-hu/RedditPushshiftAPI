2 hours into my quit, lets do this!

Not my first time quitting, but perhaps my last. Recently went 100 days without smoking, then about another 100 days of smoking, now its today. Took a whole lot of bull shit to make me break my last quit, this time I at least know I have the ability to successfully quit for 100 days, right? Past can't hold me back on this one!

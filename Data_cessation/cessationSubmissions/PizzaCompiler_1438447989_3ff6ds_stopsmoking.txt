7 months free, having anxiety

I've been cigarette free for almost 7 months now, but earlier this week I started getting a weird feeling in my nose that I just can't get rid off, and I guess I also feel that my chest is tightened up. And I think I have an occasional coughing and/or sneeze. 

It's giving me panic attacks and I'm starting to fear the worse at the moment. I've tried nasal spray and hayfever nasal spray but neither work. It feels like it's hard to breath as well. So I'm really hoping that these are just my longs cleaning itself from all the tar and I can feel a bit more at ease.

Unfortunately there's still somebody in this house that smokes so I still get a my fair share of second hand smoke. Though this is giving me so much stress that I'm nearly tempted again to just lighten up a cigarette.

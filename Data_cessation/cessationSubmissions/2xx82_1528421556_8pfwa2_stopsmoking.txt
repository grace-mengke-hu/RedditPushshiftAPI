21.33 hours in. Surrounded by triggers all day but didn't smoke.

Today was intense. I was surrounded by triggers all day. Of course the cravings were terrible but I tried to always repeat my mantra "there's no such thing as just one more." I also came up with a new mantra "one cigarette turns into two, two turns into four, four into eight, eight into sixteen..."

Before lunch break today my coworker handed me some money and asked me to pick up a pack for him while I was out. There's a language barrier between us, and I didn't want to say no without being able to explain why. So I got them anyway. There's no such thing as just one more.

Found a whole unsmoked one in my car. I smelled it then threw it out. There's no such thing as just one more.

Saw a half smoked cigarette sitting in an ashtray and resisted the urge to pick it up. There's no such thing as just one more.

Hours ago I found a pack with two in it in my junk drawer. It's currently on my desk. I haven't smoked them, since there's no such thing as just one more, though I am wondering why I haven't thrown them out yet.

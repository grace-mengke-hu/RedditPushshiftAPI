A question

Is there such thing as being ready to quit smoking though? People told me that I'm not ready yet... And I read an article as to why I might not be ready. But imho, will there ever be a time I will be ready? I'll always be addicted... It will always go along with contradicting emotions and the longer I smoke the more addicted I'll become. I smoke since I was 16 and now at the age of 23, I'm turning into a chain smoker, which is, to me at least, the ideal time to quit, Cold Turkey. Even if I feel horrible about both (about that I smoke and want to quit).

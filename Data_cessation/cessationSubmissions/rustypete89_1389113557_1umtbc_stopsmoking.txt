Back in October I posted a week before 365 that I was removing my badge

And here I am with a new one! I had first quit in October of 2012, but after starting a new job in July I became hooked on spliffs (tobacco+cannabis mixed) and by October I had finally admitted to myself that my quit attempt had failed. Once I realized that I started prepping to quit again- I hate tobacco even more than I enjoy using it! On new year's day I smoked my last spliff, at 10 am ET, in solidarity with the opening of cannabis shops in Colorado. Threw out the rest of my tobacco, haven't looked back. Been using bowls and a vaporizer since then and so far, so good!

I think I'm really done this time, you guys!

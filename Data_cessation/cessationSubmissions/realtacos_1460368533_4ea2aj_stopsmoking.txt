Bad Experiences with Allen Carr

Hi guys. Just wondering if others have had bad experiences with Allen Carr’s easyway to stop smoking?

I read the onlyway to stop smoking (a huge ass version of easy way). You smoke while reading it, so by the end of it I was very happy to be a non smoker. Anyway, it didn’t last. I found myself becoming very depressed and emotional a few days later and began smoking.

This was last year and now I’m smoking still, but hating it. I paid $650 to go to the clinic and the same thing happened. Never got my money back either. Avoid the Allen Carr Easyway Clinics - theres a book..

A few years ago, I would’ve recommended easyway to a smoker. Now I would never mention it. Allen Carr’s Easyway is a brainwashing technique which suppresses your desire to smoke. Suppressing your desire to smoke may work great for a short period but in the long run I don’t see how it will work.

Yes, I know some of Allen carr’s book is counter brain washing. But once you know all the information, and you’re still stuck smoking, and reading the book again doesn’t help, what are you left with? I’d like to know if other’s have been through a similar situation and how they overcome it?

4 Days Later.

Well, I would be lying if I said it was easy. But after a few bad days at work and having to rush my pup to the vet, everything is in the clear and I have been 100% smoke free (took some while to clean all my clothes and car)

Anyone can do this, keep up the good work and strive for success!

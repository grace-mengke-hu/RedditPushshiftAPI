Another random craving.

This weekend, out from nowhere, I had a craving to smoke. It went away after a few moments, but I am amazed how this still creeps up on me from time to time. Friday will be about 2.5 years since I quit. This Reddit support group has been phenomenal. Please let me know if I can help support anyone here.

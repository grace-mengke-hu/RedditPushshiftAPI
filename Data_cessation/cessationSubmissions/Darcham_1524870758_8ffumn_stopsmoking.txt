Physical Withdrawal Question

Today marks the 5th day of not vaping. I vaped for about 4 years, and before that I smoked for about 5 years. Currently I’m using 2mg nicotine lozenges to ease the craving. But, my main question is has any experienced minor lung pain after quitting vaping (or, smoking)? 

I only ask because over the past 5 days of quitting my lungs seem to have a minor burning sensation, but does not hurt when I breath. I’m thinking this is my body craving the smoke and nicotine from it? Or, heartburn from the lozenge.  I am going to the doctor on Monday just to be safe and just a check up done. 

But, I just wanted to see if anyone has had something similar? Any input is much appreciated!

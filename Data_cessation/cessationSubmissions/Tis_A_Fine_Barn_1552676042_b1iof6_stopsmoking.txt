Got a big packet of coupons from Marlboro in the mail today. Could've been random, but I wonder how their marketing departments work. Do they have some way to tell if someone quit? Target ads at demographics more likely to quit? Anyway, fuck Philip Morris. Presenting #094 Gengar. See you on Monday.

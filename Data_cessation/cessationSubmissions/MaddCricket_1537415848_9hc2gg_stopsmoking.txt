Teas to help us quit

I found [THIS POST](https://flowingfree.org/best-herbs-to-help-you-quit-smoking/) while being bored and looking up all the benefits of the different things I’ve ingested while quitting smoking.  I read that Skullcap was great for calming anxiety and insomnia, which I’m having plenty of, so I ordered some off Amazon.  Just got it today, and so far I’ve found it tastes wonderful and I do feel a slight sense of calm...whether or not that’s placebo, who knows.

But that list there has a BUNCH of different herbal teas and great definitions of which ones do what.  Has anyone tried any?  Anyone interested in trying some?!? 

I’m also interested in trying the Lobelia one, so I may do a field trip tomorrow and visit Whole Foods/sprouts/T.Joes to see if they have any.

Emotions getting the best of me

I’m an emotional wreck being smoke/vape free on day 2. Does anyone else have this issue? I’ll just be at work or watching tv and I’ll just think about one small thing and it’s like I can’t control my emotions, and I start to get irritable and sad for no apparent reason other than my body is going through withdrawals. Any tips to control the outbursts and when it all will stop? This shit is hard y’all.

2 weeks today without a ciggy.....it's getting more difficult

Its not the cravings, as i've been fighting them off with an occasional e-cig. I've got flu symptoms, and now on top of that nausea. Nearly thrown up twice today already. I understand that I could just be ill, but it seems to much of a coincidence 

Anyone else been this rough 2 weeks after stopping. I thought Id have been over the worst by now. :blah:

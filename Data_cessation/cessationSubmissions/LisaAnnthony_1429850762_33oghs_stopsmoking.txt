Finally it has been 1 week.

So it has been one week and my cravings for a smoke has to say the least disappeared. My girlfriend has been a major factor to this but I would like to thank /u/meanblackfox for his tip on leaving the cigarette deck close to me. Each time I even remotely looked at cigarettes I started to cringe and feel disgusted and what it does to myself and how badly it damages the people I love.

I am glad for this wonderful community and I hope to all you quitters that you never touch a cigarette again. All enjoy the rest of your week.

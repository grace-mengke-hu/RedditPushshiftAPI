First time committing to quit with the patch. 7 days in I feel great.

I've failed several times in the past, but that was always cold turkey. The patch seems to be working for me. Sure, I'm still a slave to nicotine in a way, but I'm breaking subconscious associations left and right. The first few days were rough, but I'm at a point now where my mind doesn't automatically assume "time to smoke." And that feels huge.

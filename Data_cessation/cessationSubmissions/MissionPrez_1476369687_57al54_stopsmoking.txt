What's the best medium for mastering Allen Carr's method? Book? Audiobook? DVD?

Not a smoker, but I have a lot of addictive habits that I've had trouble breaking and the bit of Allen Carr's method that I have heard resonates with me. I don't intend to start a discussion on the Cult of Allen Carr.  His methods are helpful to SOME people.  He's not a prophet, his method isn't magic, etc.

Anyways, I get the sense that some of his visualization exercises are helpful (I don't know whether to call it hypnosis or not).  So what, in your opinion, the best way to go through this method?  Printed book?  Audiobook?  Doesn't he have a DVD as well?

Thanks

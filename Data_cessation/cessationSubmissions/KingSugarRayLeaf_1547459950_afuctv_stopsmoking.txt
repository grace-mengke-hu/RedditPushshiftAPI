This is easy when you don’t drink

Two weeks today! 

Went from 20/30 a day for 8 years to nothing with no patches or whatever. Have barely any urge to smoke anymore by this point. 

Quit alcohol as well so it’s a bunch easier to not smoke when I’m not drunk. 

Get through the first couple weeks and it’s so much easier everyone!!

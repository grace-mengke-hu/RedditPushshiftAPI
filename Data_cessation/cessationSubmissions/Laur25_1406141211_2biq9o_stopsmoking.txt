Day 23 hopefully helpful hints

Hi folks, I have been a 20 a day smoker for the last 15 odd years. My handy stop smoking app has set me the mission to provide hints and tips that have helped me get to 23 days off the cancer sticks.  
1: fill the car up the day before you plan to start your quit. When I've tried to quit before I found it too easy to pay for fuel and request the fags all in the same breath. 
2: pick up a pack of opal fruits (showing my age now other wrapped fruits sweets are available) for the car. Only eat one at the point you'd normally light up on your drive to and from work. I found the act of unwrapping the sweet acted as a 'diversion' for the act of opening the cigarette box. 
3: I took up knitting again but model airplanes works just as well, something to keep your hands busy, that can be picked up or set down to take your mind off the craving. If it's something you haven't done for a while hopefully there shouldn't be any triggers.
4: I started swimming I can actually feel the benefits of not smoking. I imagine jogging works in the same way, or squash. I'm not sure tiddlywinks would work for this hint but might qualify for number 3. 
5: I downloaded a stop smoking app. It didn't give me the will power but it has illustrated all the benefits when the will power got a little bit wobbly. Such as the amount of money I haven't been setting fire to.
Hope one or all of these help.

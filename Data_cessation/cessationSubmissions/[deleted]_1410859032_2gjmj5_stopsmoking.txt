100 days!

After smoking half pack to one pack a day for almost 11 years, I have now been nicotine free for 100 days. 

Stopping smoking is the best thing I have done. I started going to the gym because now I'm not out of breathe just by walking up the stairs. Because I workout everyday I have also stopped drinking alcohol. 

I really just want to say that quitting is not easy but it feels so good to not stink, not have to plan my next smoking break, not have to stand outside no matter the weather, it's awesome to have more money and most importantly I am finally **respecting** my own body after neglecting it for so long. 

Thank you r/smoking for helping me get here. Can't wait for my 200 days post.

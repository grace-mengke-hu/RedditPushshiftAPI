Hey guys I quit friday morning.

Just here to say it was hard to get to this point. I think I spent the most of the past 3 days just trying to negotiate a way to get one haha. "If I go another 3 hours THEN I can smoke one." Some how just kept negotiating that time further away without actually smoking one.

I want to quit smoking, but my husband doesn't.

So my husband and I have been "casual smokers" for about 10 years. We normally smoke when we drink or when we're on road trips. The last year or so, we've actually increased the amount that we smoke (stress, depression, etc), to the point where I smoke 3-5 cigarettes a day and my husband will smoke 5-10 cigarettes a day.

I really want to quit. I work in a cancer hospital so I know firsthand what crap I'm putting into my body. Plus cigarettes are expensive! Like, to the point where we can't really afford to be smoking kind of expensive. 

The problem is that though I really want to quit, my husband is not on the same page. He really has no desire to quit right now. He'll say things like "oh yeah, we really need to quit. These things are terrible and expensive, etc etc". But then he'll go out the next day and buy a new pack. He works in customer service and probably 80% of his coworkers smoke. A big part of their routine is the 2-4 smoke breaks they take at work and I think he doesn't want to give that up.

My question: Can I quit smoking without my husband or can I somehow encourage him to want to quit? I'm fine for most of the day, but when I get home and he invites me out for a smoke...it's hard to say no. Plus, there is ALWAYS a pack of cigarettes sitting around the house. Talk about temptation...

Any advice on how to quit when your partner still smokes or how to encourage your partner to quit along with you? 

Thanks, I appreciate it!

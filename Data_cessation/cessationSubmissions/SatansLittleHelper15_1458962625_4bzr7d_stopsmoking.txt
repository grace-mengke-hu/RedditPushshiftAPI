Diagnosed with Bronchitis on Wednesday...

I have been smoking now for 20 years. I get sick sometimes and cough sometimes, but have never been diagnosed with bronchitis...until this week. I have had chest congestion, coughing and wheezing unlike ever before. My doctor gave me an inhaler used to treat COPD   to help with my breathing and some anti-biotics to help with any bacterial infection I may have...and recommended I quit smoking. After researching Acute Bronchitis, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema and COPD, I realize this case of Bronchitis is just the first step towards a lot of misery and death if I do not stop smoking NOW. So, After having two cigarettes on Thursday, I went completely smoke free today, Friday. My congestion is better already, though the withdrawals are starting. I am going to fight my hardest this time to quit for good. I have too much to live for and need to be around for a while as a functioning person. The wheezing and deep congestion coughing really scared the heIl out of me too. I want to heal as much as I can and not continue on the road to COPD.

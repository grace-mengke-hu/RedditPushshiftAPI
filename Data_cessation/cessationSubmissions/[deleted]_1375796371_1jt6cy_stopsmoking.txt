The best way to remove nicotine stains from your teeth?

Recently quit smoking. My family came through to Edinburgh for the day and my little cousin could not stop mentioning my "dirty teeth" and asking me why I didn't brush them. Basically, I have a few stains on my teeth that I'd like to get rid of quickly. Does anyone have any tips on how to remove them?

Edit: Wow, thank you for all the advice, guys. Didn't realise peroxide and baking soda could do the trick! Will try using it about 2 times a week.

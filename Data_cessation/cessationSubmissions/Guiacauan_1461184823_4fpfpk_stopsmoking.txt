If i could do it, you could do it.

Howdy!

I'll put this plainly.

I'm a heavymetal singer and producer in a small town from Brazil,, i spend 50% of my time with the heaviest, craziest, smokers, drinkers and addicts you could possibly imagine.

I used to be like them 24 days ago, i would drink something around 8 to 12 heinekens a day (binge until i pass out every week or so), smoke 1 to 3 packs o Camel's a day (depending on how drunk i was, and how good was the chat that evening).

Dont get me wrong, i was a pretty functional drunken bastard, i have a job that pays me very well, i have a wife and kid that i cherish.

I have pretty good control over my emotions, so even being a big dumb drunk fat fuck, i didn't let the ball hit the floor...


For no reason at all, (I was cherishing the idea of someday go Taxi Driver for a long time, No more bad food, no more shit inside my body.)Besides that, i was never that lame dumb fuck that cries out, wheelping to people "i'm trying to quit"... "i'm trying to quit again".. Fuck, i'm refuse to be on my knees...

So, for NO REASON AT ALL, i just went cold turkey for a week...

The cravings got me pretty hard, so i started to post here, i started to read a lot on the suject, and i started to enjoy life..

Life my friends...

I gained 2 hours a day, i used to spend outside my home/job doing NOTHING, destroying me..

I started to picture the fact, that my daughter will need me in the future.. i need to stay alive for as long as i can...

You see, i lost my father when i was twelve, he didn't smoke, was killed in a kidnap, but i still cries because of that even now...  and my daughter (she's 10 now) will not cry, because i used to be stupid...

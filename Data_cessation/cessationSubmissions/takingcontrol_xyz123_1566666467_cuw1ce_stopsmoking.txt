I relapsed. I lost my way. No more. I don't want to smoke anymore.

Hey folks

I've quit smoking perhaps 6-7 times in the past 3 years. Always last a few months, maybe 3-4, before I fail.

The reason for failure is always about
- forgetting the initial intensity and severity of my thoughts on why I want to quit
- a moment of weakness in an outlier environment where I end up having one cigarette, and poof, a month later I'm smoking a couple/day

I've seen my patterns, I've seen where I've failed. I'm tired of that. I no longer want to. This should be my final attempt because I never want to smoke ever ever again. I'm doing this for me above all else. For myself.

To keep myself accountable + serve as a constant reminder of my commitment, I pledge to myself
- that I will make a post EVERY SINGLE DAY on Reddit with the only requirement being that I write just one thoughtful line about "why I quit/why I no longer smoke"

This is day 0. I can't wait to start day 1. The start of the rest of my life as a NON SMOKER.

Day three! I'm living in a sleepy fog of wonderment.

Day three!!!! Hooray Allen Carr! I feel a craving and I don't freak out. I just say "oh, this is when I'd normally light up. I'm a non smoker and don't need that anymore." 

It's been pretty empowering, but I'm tiiiiiiiiirreeeeeed. Oh God, I keep waking from microsleeps. I could sleep for days and even when I am awake, I'm totally out of it.

About how long should I expect this to last?

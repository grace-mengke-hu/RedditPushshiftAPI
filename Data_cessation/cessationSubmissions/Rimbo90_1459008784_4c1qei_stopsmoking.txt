I know it's a leap year....

But can I count today as my anniversary please, gang?

So proud of myself and happy to reach this milestone. I'll be honest though I haven't really been counting down to this.

After the first fortnight or so I just didn't really think about smoking all that much. When I did, I thought of how it would undo all the hard work and would really celebrate whenever I rode out a craving. I'll be honest though, they didn't come around that often.

I smoked for five years. Now it just seems like a different lifetime to me; it almost seems so strange that I used to smoke. I look at people smoking now and walk through the smoke sometimes and don't even think of it!

Trust me if I can do this so can you. It's all about state of mind. I had tried previously and failed but that last time I quit I just really started to hate smoking. I taught myself to hate it.

So congrats me and congrats to everyone currently on a quit or thinking about the journey! It's a rewarding process!!

I couldn't have had this successful a quit without the insight of some of the good folks on here!

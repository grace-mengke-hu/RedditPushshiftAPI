Should I smoke that last one?

I came here by chance and read all those great posts. Now I'm totally motivated to finally 'do it'. I wanted stop smoking since I began. But it just got worse. 
I have one last cigarette left in my pack. I didnt smoke since 4 houres, which is quite long for me. Should I smoke that cigarette before I quit?

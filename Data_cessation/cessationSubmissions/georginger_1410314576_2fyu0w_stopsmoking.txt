Losing my willpower

Hi guys,

So this is my first post here after lurking for quite a few months.

This is my fourth attempt at quitting. I'm on day 34 today. At the beginning, I felt more motivated to quit than I ever have before. I've had two puffs of a cigarette since quitting. I didn't even enjoy those hits.

Over the last week though, my self control has been slowly waning. I find myself looking at people smoking and telling myself that "one can't hurt". These thoughts have been far and few between since stopping, but the last 4 days, it's been almost every time I see a cigarette being smoked.

I know I don't want to start smoking again. Life is better without it, and I know that I can do this. I know that I have to think of quitting as a marathon rather than a sprint, but I just wanted to share my thought with you guys. There's not many people I can speak to in person that is in the same boat as me and I needed to tell my situation to people that will get it.

Thanks guise.

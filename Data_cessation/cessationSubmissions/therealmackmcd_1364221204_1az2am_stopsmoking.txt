Day 4: Concentration making me nervous

I'm on day 4, and the weekend was seeming pretty basic. I was feeling confident despite having some rough cravings here and there, but nothing I couldn't manage fairly easily.

But now it's Monday. I'm back at work, in front of my desk, and my concentration levels are causing me concern. I'm tempted to punch out and go home simply because my productivity is almost nil. I can't focus on anything and I'm not sure how to get around this.

I still don't want to smoke, but I can't risk my job. I've heard other people using medication to help with concentration but to be honest, if I'm going to treat my lack of focus with dangerous medication, I might as well pick up smoking again. I'd rather smoke than take Zyban or Wellbutrin. 

Help!

Another Hurdle

I just returned from my second visit to France without smoking. The first time didn't count because I was ill and it was only a couple days.  This time it was like two weeks and a stressful/relaxed/emotional/calamity of a holiday...

So, I'm counting this as a hurdle cleared.

Sometimes I'm surprised that I ever smoked and out of the blue...something happens and I think, I would like to smoke now. 

Then I get through that stressor and I didn't smoke and now I can go back to not thinking about smoking. But I thought I'd check in here too. So yeah, mostly don't ever think about it...but once in a while...and then it passes.

Everyone can do this.

Household started smoking again

I'm currently living with my girlfriend and her parents. While my girlfriend never really smoked, both of her parents did. When I quit back in November, they followed a month later and quit as their New Year's resolutions. Everyone was doing great until now, when her father brings home a pack from the bar late last night and has been smoking like a chimney every since. He's gone through a whole pack (at least) in the past 12 hours. It's all I can fucking smell. Mom will follow soon, I predict.

Happy 300 days smoke free to me. Blah.

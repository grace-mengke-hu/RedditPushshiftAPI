Started vaping to begin quitting smoking, but I am continously taking hits from my e-cig. Need advice

As seen in the title. I bought a e-cig and haven't touched a single cigarette since. However, when I'm at home I'm continously vaping. Like taking several hits every 5 minutes. I can't seem to imagine that this is better than smoking tobacco, especially considering I'm inhaling even more nicotine into my body. Anyone else have experience with this? Am I doing something wrong?

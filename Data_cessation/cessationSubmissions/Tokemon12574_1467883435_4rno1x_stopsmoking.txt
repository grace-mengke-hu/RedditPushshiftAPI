A quick stop in... 300 days!

I'm really stoked to get to this arbitrary milestone and when I had five days... ten days... twenty... a month... two months... it seemed impossible that I would be here. I didn't want to smoke but ten months seemed *so far away.*

The purpose of this post is to give some hope to those who are early in their quit! You can totally do it if the mindset is there! The hardest thing about quitting was deciding that *this time* I wasn't fucking around. 

You'll be amazed at how quickly the benefits start manifesting. 

Bring on 365!

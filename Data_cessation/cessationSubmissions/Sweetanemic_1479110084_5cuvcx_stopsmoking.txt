Panicking

I've been a smoker on and off for the past 15 years. I've never been able to fully kick the habit but I want to. I turned 30 earlier this year and my husband turns 30 at the end of next month. After a lot of thought and consideration a few weeks ago I decided that for my husband's birthday present I was going to quit smoking and use the savings to spoil him. I set my quit date for November 15th (which gives me plenty of time as a pack a day smoker to save a nice chunk of money before his birthday) so I would be smoke free for over a month by his birthday. But now that my quit date is almost here I'm panicking. I'm worried the panic is going to cause me to wake up tomorrow morning and decide to not do this and buy a pack or two or three. In my state of panic I started googling for help with quitting smoking and came across this community. I actually just signed up for reddit to post for support. Any advice/words of encouragement would be so greatly appreciated.

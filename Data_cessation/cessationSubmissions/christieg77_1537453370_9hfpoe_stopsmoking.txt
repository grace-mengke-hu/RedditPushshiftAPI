Made the 4 Day Mark!!!

I just reached my 4 day mark of quitting and man the cravings.  I know I have to do this and I have wanted to do it for years now, but man it is tough.  I am finding the hardest thing is what to fill my time with now that I am not stopping for smoke breaks.  I work from home so it was always easy just to head outside when ever I needed a break or some "fresh" air, but now I have nothing to head outside or break for.  UGH!!!

3 weeks and counting 🙌🏻

My dad recently died of a sudden heart attack at 59. It still doesn’t even seem real . Through this mess , I have promised to NEVER smoke again. I can’t even have just one because I know It will turn into more. And I can’t do the vape because honestly I feel like your putting down one habit for another. 3 weeks smoke free , cold turkey.  Each day has gotten easier and easier . You can do it, because your LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

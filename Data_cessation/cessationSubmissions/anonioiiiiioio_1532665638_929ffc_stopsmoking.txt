I smoked my last cigarette today.

I still have half of a pack of cigarettes in my desk drawer at work, but I'm not going to smoke any of them. To the trash! Crumpled up. Five packs ago I told myself I would smoke one cigarette per day at lunch only when I work. Yeah, you know how that goes... I'm up to 3 or 4 smoke breaks per day at work. I hate it. I feel like shit, guilty too. I work out. I run 5ks at work. I literally climb mountains. I'm a god damn vegetarian! Why do I smoke? I hate it.

I'm going to fight the urges. If I can get through tomorrow, I can be done for good. Cigarettes are my spirit animal and we're about to separate our souls from each other. Except not really because it's just a FUCKING ADDICTION I'm over it. I hate cigarettes. Wish me luck.

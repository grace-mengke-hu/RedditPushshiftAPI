Alternative to sunflower seeds?

I'm helping my fiancee quit smoking and I had a question. She has jaw pain issues which make sunflower seeds not an option. Is there something else that has a similar benefit but won't be an issue for her jaw?

Also, she is quitting by allowing herself a certain amount per day and dropping that number by 1 every two weeks and then later on possibly supplementing with the patch. I agree that cold turkey is a superior method but I'm so happy that she is willing to try ANY method that I am going to support her in every way possible. So, is there anything that we can do to help ensure that this method will be successful?

Thanks guys and gals!

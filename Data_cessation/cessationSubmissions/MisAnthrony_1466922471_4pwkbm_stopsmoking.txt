3-4 Months Clean, Still Have Cravings?

Hello everybody. This is my first real post on Reddit, so my apologies if I do anything incorrectly.

 I've been clean for anywhere from ninety to over a hundred days, but I'm having incredible amounts of issues even still, and on a daily basis. Is the craving for a cigarette every day for months after quitting a common thing, and, if so, how can I mitigate this effect? Thank you in advance!

10 days but concert tonite

Hi guys. Still havnt had any nicotine for 10days but going to concert tonite and I'm already feeling very anxious bout not smoking. Not real sure why I'm so worried, guess cause I've never not smoked going to one. Plan to stop at bar before so hoping if I drink enough I will just forget that I ever used to smoke.

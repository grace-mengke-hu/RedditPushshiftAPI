301 Days. Checking in!

I haven't been very active in this subreddit since I last requested a badge. I wanted to check in to provide some real experience and hopefully inspiration to new quitters now that I've finally kicked the habit.

I'm not going to bore you with my story, but I'm going to tell you how it is today. Yes, I still get a craving from time to time. TV and movies with smoking were always triggers for me. I also miss putting life on hold for 10 minutes at a time during smoke breaks (there are much healthier ways to do this now).

What don't I miss? Running out of breath going up a few stairs. Smelling like shit all the time. Getting headaches and anxiety when it's been too long without a smoke. Oh, and the hundreds of dollars wasted as well.

What has quitting for this long taught me? That I am a master of my own mind and body. This is one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's given me the strength to finally quit drinking, and I've been sober for nearly 30 days. It's been easier than I thought it would be.

The road to recovery from any form of addiction is a long one, but the reward is always great. The long term rewards outweigh the short term relief (and long term damage) that nicotine provides.

Stick with it. Cravings are just your mind playing tricks; you are always in control. Will I smoke again in the future? I hope not, but I sure as hell won't smoke today. We may always be addicts, but we can control what we do today. Fuck the zero!

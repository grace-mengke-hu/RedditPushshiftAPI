Problems sleeping after stopping Champix/Chantix

Anybody else experience this? I stopped taking it around saturday, and this week has been absolutely brutal, just crazy insomnia all week. It has definitely effected my work performance. I am trying to tough it out this week (hoping my brain can get back to normal) without using otc sleeping pills but Melatonin has not been helping at all. I guess what I'm wondering is if anybody else experienced this, how long did it last, and did anything in specific help you overcome the insomnia?

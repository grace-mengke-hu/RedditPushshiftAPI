Need help, smoke free for 4.5 years but started smoking casually

Hi guys,

As the title says I am smoke free for over 4.5 years but recently started smoking again. Initially, it was only when I drink. But now I crave smoke even when I am sober and bored. I truly believe that I might end up getting hooked soon. Help!!!

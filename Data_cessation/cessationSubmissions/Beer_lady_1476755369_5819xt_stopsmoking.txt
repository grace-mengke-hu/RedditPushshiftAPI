82 days

I'm so glad I quit. 

Last weekend I went to a Halloween event and it was really hot inside. Unfortunately you couldn't leave so I had to go to the smoking area outside to get some air. As soon as I walked into it, it smelled really gross. As I walked by the hordes of smokers, I was really glad I wasn't one of them. I sat down and leaned against the wall. I played with my phone. I felt the cool air. Then I went inside. I was totally okay with not smoking. I mean, still vary aware of the smoking/not smoking thing but I didn't want to bum one. 

I wonder if that awareness will ever go away? Will I ever see a smoker again and  not smugly think to myself that I'm not one anymore? Because I don't like that feeling. 

I love that I don't obsess about smoking. God, it was this constant nagging in my life. I was constantly preoccupied with the where and the when and how many I had left. All those logistical questions are gone. 

My car smells nice. I smell nice. I've saved a lot of money. I'm really proud of myself. I quit once before for 6 months. But this time has been different and I don't really know why. Maybe I'm different. I don't dream about it. I haven't obsessed about it. I just stopped smoking one day and it's been totally okay. 

Anyway, good luck to the folks who just quit. Thanks and keep up the good work to the folks who have been at it for a while. And to those on the fence: you can do it.

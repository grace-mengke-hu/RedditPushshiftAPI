no sense of accomplishment here, and i think thats ok

My logic here is, if i had this "Big PROUD" about quitting i would be elevating smoking to somewhere it should not belong, its a filthy grubby fucker that i have not touched for almost 9 days  
Either way i haven't smoked ( cant say i haven't wanted too at times, its still creeping in there daily) and i cant see myself doing it again either. but i dont feel like i have achieved anything

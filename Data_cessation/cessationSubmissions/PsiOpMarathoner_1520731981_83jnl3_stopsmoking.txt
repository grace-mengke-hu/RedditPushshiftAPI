Horror story

So i have a long horrid history with smoking.  Started at twelve practically quit when my son was bourn but keep on because of schizophrenic possession, that was three years with no cravings and no desire to smoke but I couldn't stop. So now I have been trying hard again to quit, and for a couple of days it felt like it just wasn't going to happen at least in this life time.  So horror story is over with now I could use some support and advice.

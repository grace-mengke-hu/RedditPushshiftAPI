Any suggestions to say no to an offer to smoke

I work at a place where everyone is smoking and some offer me cigarettes. I can muster up the will power not to buy a pack but nature of my work makes sure that i cant avoid people who smoke. I just cant say no because all it takes is a hesitation when they ask me "would you like one?". And im saying yes. These arent coleagues either, they are customers, and i work outside where they are free to smoke. Any one go through a similar situation. What is your tactic. 
Edit: spelling

Dreaming about smoking

So since about day 5 I've been having dreams about smoking. Usually that I broke down and bought a pack of that I convinced myself that I can just smoke occasionally. Every morning it's such a relief to know that I didn't let myself down. Here we are on day 12 cold turkey and the cravings are almost gone. I have been purposely putting myself into the situations that trigger my cravings since the start as a sort of immersion therapy and that's what's been working for me, unless smoking in a dream counts.

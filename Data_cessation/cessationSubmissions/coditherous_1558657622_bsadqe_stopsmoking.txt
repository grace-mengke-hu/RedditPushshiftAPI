50 days smoke free, been getting alot of cravings lately

This is the longest I've gone smoke free in a few years. In my previous attempts, I've gotten around the 45 day marks and the cravings always come back kinda strong around that time. I've found myself trying to justify it by saying "oh I went a whole 50 days, I deserve a few."

 Just trying to remember and keep telling myself that its the nicotine talking trying to make a come back. And that all it is, is a chemical addiction. It's not going to help me feel less stressed or really give me anything positive. Just going to kill me faster. 

 Just wanted to share. I'm gonna keep fighting to stay smoke free and I hope the rest of y'all can too! Keep up the good work everyone.

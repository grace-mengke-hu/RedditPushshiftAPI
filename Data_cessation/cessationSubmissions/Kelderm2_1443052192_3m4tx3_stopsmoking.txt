From a pack a day, to vaping, to nothing.

I'm just over a month of no cigarettes or vaping and I just wanted to say that vaping really helped me.  I know people may knock it but i went from 24mg and eventually cut down to 6 in a few months and then nothing.  This is even with my roommates occasionally smoking and constantly vaping(it was like starving while the guy next to you always has a filet on his plate).  Anyways I just wanted to say thanks and I'm going to keep strong so you guys do it too!

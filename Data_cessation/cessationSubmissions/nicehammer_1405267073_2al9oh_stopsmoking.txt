49.

49 days ago i couldn't have imagined making it this far. The longest and ve made it before this was two weeks. I think comming here and reading peoples stories has helped me a lot. Ifinally feel like a non smoker and it feels good. I have started excercising more and have saved almost $600. I can smell , and sing better! (I think). My teeth seem whiter and i can smell the flowers driving around town. Another thing I've noticed is that im not in a rush anymore to finish things and have a cigarette, so im more productive at work and home. Keep stronge people we got this! Outty 5000.

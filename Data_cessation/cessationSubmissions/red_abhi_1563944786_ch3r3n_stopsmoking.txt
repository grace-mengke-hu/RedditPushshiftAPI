What's happening to me

Hi,
I started smoking 1 year ago, but it was in control.. maybe 5-6 smokes a week. Recently I moved to somewhere with no restrictions and started around 9-10 a day. It's been a week or two at that pace. I had to walk two km yesterday and my body started hurting. I was feeling breathless. My lungs have started feeling heavy and it's troublesome. Can someone tell me what's happening to me. I also play tennis(haven't been able to play since like 2 months tho), is my game fucked already. I have hypothyroidism and am around 13-14 kg overweight if that changes anything. I thought of quitting but can't. Have cut down to 3-4 a day for the last two days though.

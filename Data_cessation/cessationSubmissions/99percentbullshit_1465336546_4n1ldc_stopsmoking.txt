7 days down, a lifetime to go

So it's been 7 days. Quit cold turkey (definitely has it's challenges), but I figured I'd post an update about what I've been doing and how I've been coping. 
So first off, I've been using the smoke free app, I haven't set a "reward" yet, mostly been using it to track my progress. 
Since I've quit, I've started getting up early in the morning and been going to the gym (was going on and off prior to quitting). I do a 30-45 minute routine with the weights, then I finish it up with about 30-40 minutes of cardio. I've started the couch to 5k routine as my source of cardio, but I add an additional 10-20 minutes of brisk walking. I'm just happy that I can breathe while doing cardio again.
And finally, chewing gum... I keep a pack at home, in the car, and in the office. Just some plain sugar-free gum, and I just chew it whenever I get a craving or just feel like having a smoke(craving vs. habit).

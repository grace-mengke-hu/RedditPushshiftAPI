Didn't plan on quitting, but it's been 5 days without a cigarette.

Got a stomach bug on New Years day and didn't smoke all day.  Felt crappy the next day and didn't smoke.  Decided to see how many days I could stretch it and now on day 5.  Cold Turkey.  No patches, gum or pills.  Stomach flu is gone, and feeling better than I've felt in a long time.  Going to see how long I can keep it up!

The universe gave me a test today... I passed with flying colors!

I was walking my dog today and saw a cigarette pack on the ground near the sidewalk. When I was a smoker, I'd always check to see if packs still had cigarettes in them (they never did). I checked this pack and it was nearly full!!! I laughed and put it back and walked away :)

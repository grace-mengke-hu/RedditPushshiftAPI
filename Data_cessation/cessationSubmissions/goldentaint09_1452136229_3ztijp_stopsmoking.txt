Well i screwed up but I've been back at it

I quit originally a month ago and did good with using nicotine gum. I quickly fell off and started bumming off of friends. I actually smoked black and milds for a couple days. Then i said enough is enough and have been smoke and nic free since the 27 of December! I feel better than ever but my chest does still get tight from time to time. But im not giving in

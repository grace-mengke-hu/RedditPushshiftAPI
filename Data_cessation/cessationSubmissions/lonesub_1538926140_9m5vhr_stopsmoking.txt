I relapsed today on day 1

Have to re read Alan Carr's book . Well atleast I didnt fap or drink today so it's nice .but still I just couldn't handle both caffeine and smoke withdrawal together . I was frikking tired and lethargic today . I finally caved in and had a cigarette . I feel bad I'll try again tomorrow .

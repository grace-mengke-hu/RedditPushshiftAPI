smoking and kink

i'm probably gonna delete this.

so, i'm into kink, i'm the dominant one. my partner is submissive and likes burns. cigarettes are really the most efficient and best way to burn some one in that context. 


anyone else dealt with this? i'm coming up on a year cig free but i'm feeling inhibitted, not because i'm without nicotine but because i'm without a kink tool. any thoughts?

Haven't smoked since Feb 21st

I have a pretty straight forward short story.


Smoked for 17 years. Got sick, continued to smoke. Got sicker, continued to smoke when I felt better. Got sicker, stopped smoking because I physically couldn't. Got sicker and ended up near death and coma in the hospital. I haven't smoked since I got out about a month ago. EDIT: I realized that I smoked occasionally for a week after I got out (not realizing how bad of shape I was in). Feb 21st I smoked my last cigarette outside of a bar I'm unable to drink in anymore (more health stuff). 


Here's the deal I'm sort of pissed about and have some questions about. NONE of that "after 3 days your lung capacity has risen 50%" and "You can taste food 150% better" type of stuff has happened. I don't feel a whole lot better than I use to feel, I only hit mental triggers every so often, but when I do I really want to smoke until I smell 2nd hand stuff (which smells like heaven and hell at the same time). That's what I noticed right away, you can smell cigarettes from miles away, which I've been oblivious to because I've smoked since I was 15 and didn't know how the world worked.

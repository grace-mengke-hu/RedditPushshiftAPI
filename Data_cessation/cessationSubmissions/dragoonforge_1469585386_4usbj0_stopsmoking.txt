Trying to quit.

Ok, need some advice, been trying to quit for a month or so, but am finding it hard. Ive cut back from 3 packs a day to 1 1/2 a day. but I cant get my self lower.  After talking to several co workers who have stopped. they suggested a vape setup, and helped me get one. Im finding it hard to get used to using but I can see the premise of it. 

This is all in the last week or so that I got the device and just got some decent flavor for it.  My question is, has anyone here used one of these to quit smoking? Any tips? I have tried chantix, cold turkey, patch and none worked for me. 

Also I live with folks who smoke in the house, and when I go out of town to the farm for hunting/fishing, my dad and friends smoke in the house down there, which is one reason I took my co workers suggestion for a vape, as from what they say, it still satisfy the habit of puffing on a cig.

Here is my list of reasons wanting to quit.

Better health.
Bought my first brand new truck, and do not want to smoke in it. 
Money
Smell. 

Thats just a small list but most important.

I have set a date for my self of Aug 1st to stop cigs and use the vape only. I will still be getting nicotine at this point, but unlike smokes, shops offer varying levels of nicotine so it offers a chance to ween off it it. 

for the TLDR version.

Coworkers suggested vape to help stop smoking. looking for tips to help.

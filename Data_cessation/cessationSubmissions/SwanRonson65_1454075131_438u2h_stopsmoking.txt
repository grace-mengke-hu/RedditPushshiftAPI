Made A Deal. Now I Don't Know If I Can Hold Up My End.

So my Mom is a Diet Coke nut. She drinks over 100oz of it a day. I realize it's not the worst vice, but it's still not great for you. I decided to make her a deal; starting April 1, she stops drinking Diet Coke and I stop smoking. Now, the more I think about my end of the bargain, the more worried I get.

I've been a pack-a-day smoker for about 10 years now. I smoke when I'm bored, after a good meal, when I'm stressed, etc. But the most comfort smoking brings me is when I'm feeling anxious. I have suffered with anxiety for the past few years, and while smoking of course isn't a cure, it definitely brings me a lot of comfort when I'm feeling my anxiety is high. 

Smoking has been a part of my life for 10 years, and although I *know* how much better I'll feel once I've quit, even the thought of quitting at this point is bringing me anxiety. I have a month to kick the habit and I need some kind words and advice to let me know it'll all be ok.

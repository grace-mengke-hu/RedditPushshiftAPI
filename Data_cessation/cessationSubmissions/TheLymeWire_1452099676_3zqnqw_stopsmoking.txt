Passed my 72 hours COLD TURKEY!

I never thought it would be possible. I have quit before, a few times, but this was my first cold turkey attempt. I decided to quit on a whim so I could afford to lease a horse for my daughter. 

I have been lurking over reddit for years and had to sign in today so that I could come here and say thanks for this sub. I come here to pass my cravings and couldn't have done it without being reminded to "Make today my bitch" and such. 

My SO smokes and for 80+ hours I have stared down my addiction and told it to STFU! Had some major drama come up last night that provided the perfect opportunity to tell myself it was too stressful right now and I could cave and I told that stupid addict voice NO! 

So I am feeling really confident and grateful and warm and fuzzy and wanted to share. Not one puff. Never ever ever ever ever ever again. That's all it takes. Hang in there! You can totally do this.

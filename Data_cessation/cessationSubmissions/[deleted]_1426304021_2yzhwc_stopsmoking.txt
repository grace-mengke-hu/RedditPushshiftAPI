Nothing ventured lots gained!

Hi all. I quit smoking last feb 29th. A little over 3 years ago as the   last feb 29th was in 2012. A memorable date to be sure but rest   assured that is not what after dozens of tries gave me the resolve   to finally quit. That's right it's easy to quit i've done it dozens of   times. As many of you know that statement is no longer funny    because of the truth of the hold cigarettes can have on you.    


  So what finally worked for me?  
it will seem funny but a total lack of expectation helped a lot. by    that I mean on feb 29th i smoked my last smoke with great    resolve to quit but i told no one of my plans. No co workers, spouse    or kids would I tell.  


i decided if i failed no one would be the wiser and i was tired of   beating myself up over another failed attempt. over the 35 years I   smoked i had tried almost every smoking cessation that came out;   laser, hypnosis, zantac all with limited success. All of them ask you   to document your actions and ask for support from spouse, co      workers etc. upon reflection what a lot of unneeded pressure when   stress of any type is totally counter productive.  


it would seem with no expectations from anyone but myself there   was no to little stress. No peering spouses, co-workers kids etc     checking you out for signs of smoking. i noticed almost     immediately that without outside expectations my resolve seemed   to grow. To keep my little secret became my resolve. Almost a    month passed before my wife asked me if i had quit smoking.   when i told her it had been a month she didn't believe me at first.   i think it was because previous attempts would have expectations    causing stress causing grouchiness etc. again with no expectations   came no stress to perform.  


while i know this may not help many of you but if it helps even one of you it was worth my while writing.

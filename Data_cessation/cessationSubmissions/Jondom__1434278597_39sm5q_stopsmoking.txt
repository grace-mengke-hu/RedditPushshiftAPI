I went out yesterday, I didn't smoke.

I haven't reset my badge but I quit (again) on the 12th. I went out around the city with friends for about 10 hours and I found it hard to keep my mind off smoking. However, thanks to my friend's support, I pulled through!
I know for most of y'all it isn't a big achievement but this was a *huge* step for me, and I honestly don't know how you guus did this, wish me luck on the upcoming days :)

I quit smoking but I feel like a cheater

Merry Christmas y’all. I quit smoking cigarettes and cigars a couple months back, but I feel like a cheater as I have supplemented one addiction for another it seems in vaping and dipping tobacco. I do both to get that “nicotine fix”. 

My best advice to anyone out there is to try and quit cold turkey if at all possible. Don’t be like me and allow yourself to get addicted to something else. I just needed to write this down and get it off my chest.

Question about Allen Carr

I'm currently about half way through Allen Carr's book, and I really just want to stop smoking now.  He says not to, so I'm going to continue to hate myself for another couple of days until I finish reading.

I was thinking of switching to the cheapest brand possible.   Not to save money, but so they taste even more disgusting these last few days.  Would he suggest that, or would he say to not change my addiction until I stop completely?

Thanks for the input.

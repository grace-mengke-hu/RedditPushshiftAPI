Another 1 year veteran checking in, to share some advice that helped me reach this goal

So today's the day when my badge becomes a smiling star! If someone would've asked me 13 months ago if I saw myself as a non-smoker today I'd say 'no way', but here I am: smoke free, after being a pack-a-day guy for a quarter of a century. Anyway, here's some tips that helped me and hopefully it'll help and motivate you to get rid of that burden:  
 
* **Cravings never last more than a few minutes**: This is the most important thing you need to keep in mind. Yes, you'll have cravings, and some people are better than others at handling them, but if you're one of those who feels absolutely miserable without a cigarette, if you ever feel that every bone of your body is aching for another puff, *all you have to do is hold on for a few minutes, no more*. It'll pass, trust me, and after a week our body will no longer require nicotine and you'll notice your cravings become less and less frequent until they become a bad memory.
 
* **Smoking messes up your body, whether you notice right away or not**: Maybe you're in your early 20s and you still can run a marathon and have a puff or two the moment you cross the finish line. Maybe your aunt Rose reached her 90s while smoking 2 packs a day and didn't die of emphysema, but the only truth behind all that is that *smoking damages your quality of life*, regardless of your genetic history or your ability to exercise without losing your breath. I suffered for years of what doctors called 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome' and had to take a lot of things I used to love off my diet due to horrible, excruciating intestinal cramps that not even intravenous muscle relaxants could stop once they started, and guess what? Every symptom of what I thought was going to be a chronic, debilitating disease just disappeared a couple of months after my last cigarette. So remember, maybe your genes will determine your longevity, but the quality of your life depends entirely on your own choices.
* **Every step towards quitting helps**: It's OK if you don't succeed after a few days, weeks or months; It's OK if you gain a couple of pounds, because you replaced cigarettes with lollipops, hell even it's OK if you decide you'll vape instead of smoking, *the important thing is that you never stop trying to get rid of the habit*, so don't feel bad if you relapse or substitute, it's just another step towards quitting, as long as you keep going.
* **You don't have to 'ditch your collateral'**: If you're like me, your smoking habit is deeply ingrained between other parts of your routine. Maybe it's your after-lunch break, maybe it's your 'wind-down' poison after a long day or maybe it's your 'beer-companion'. I call those the 'smoking collateral' and in my case it was the complement of my coffee habit. I couldn't even think of having a shot of espresso without a cigarette and felt incredibly sad because I thought I would no longer be able to enjoy my favorite beverage in the world (*why having coffee without cigarettes?*). Today, not only I enjoy coffee more than ever, now I can tell a light from a dark roast cup while blindfolded because the sense of smell -that old friend I forgot I had- returned when I stopped smoking to help me enjoy flavors and smells much more than before.
* **Not everyone goes through the same phases**. Last but not least. We have a saying in my country "Everyone will talk about the party, according to how they did" so how you feel, how long it takes for you, what you need to do, what your body demands, may be completely different from someone who went through the same process. *Don't let the 'I tried everything and it didn't work' naysayers discourage you from trying*. Who knows? maybe it'll be a piece of cake and you'll be wondering why didn't you tried to quit earlier, like I did.

That's it. Sorry for the wall of text and my rather poor English grasp. I'd also like to thank /u/redtaboo and the moderator team of this wonderful community, that has provided me with invaluable encouragement, support and advice. Did you ever thought at some point on your lives that you would end up bringing real, positive change to a bunch of people across the world? 'cause you're doing just that and that makes you amazing people!

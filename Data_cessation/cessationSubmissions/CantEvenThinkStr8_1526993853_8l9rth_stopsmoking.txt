Thinking about quitting, but I'm asking for some stupid advice.

So, I'm used to smoking about 3-4 cigarettes per day. Yesterday, I started a new job and they had me watching training videos from 4-8 PM. I only had one cigarette at 9 that morning, but by the time I was watching those videos, the nicotine withdrawal was hitting me full force: I had a headache, I was exhausted and I was beginning to feel so irritable/frustrated that it was hard for me to focus a couple of times...and I know it can be worse for at least another day, or two afterward before the worst of the withdrawals are over.

AFAIK I have one more day scheduled this week, which is also today at 4-8 PM. The advice I'm asking for, is this: Should I allow myself one more day to smoke before going into work so that I can focus...and then deal with the withdrawal on my days off? Or should I just try to quit today and see if I can power through it while watching another 10 videos?

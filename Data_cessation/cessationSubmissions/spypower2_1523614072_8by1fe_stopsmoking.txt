I keep getting these sudden cravings. Can someone help?

It's been 11 days since I quit. I've had no physical withdrawal symptoms for the last 8 days or so. But I keep getting these tiny cravings randomly, and they usually go away in about a minute or so. Something like "A cigarette now won't be bad". I've been successfully able to ignore these cravings, but I'm still worried. Anyone else felt the same way? If so, how did you get over it?

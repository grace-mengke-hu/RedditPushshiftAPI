Day two. Things that have helped so far (which I learned here and from other sources)

Feeling pretty good so far. Nicotine patches are still helping and I've gotten some great insight already.

From the nicotine patch box I learned something important for people using cessation devices to help quit. **They are a tool, not a cure.** Use them to help the physical withdrawal, and use this time to figure out why you are mentally addicted to cigarettes.

* Become comfortable being uncomfortable (Saw this either here or on a link recommended to me)
* Temptations are good for success. Resiting the urge to smoke makes me feel in control of myself; I'm getting better at it.
* My past failures of quitting only prepared me for this attempt, where I will succeed.
* Excuses are bullshit. Don't set yourself up for failure. Life gets tough sometimes, inhaling smoke doesn't fix your problems.
* Easier said than done, know it's tough but keep on going.

Wish I could credit those who said this advice, but I am paraphrasing, and a tad bit lazy.

TL;DR: Motivational stuff that seems to help.

Advice to help push someone else to quit?

Hi everyone, I myself am not a smoker but my dad has been a long time smoker for almost his entire life. He quit for 5 years(this was about 15 years ago but picked it back up. I think he smokes close to a pack a day. He does want to quit though - has even talked to his doctor about it(her advice was to start cutting back now) and talks about it often but he just hasn't made any actual moves to do it. I want to help him just not sure if there is anything I can do to give him the push he needs.  Thanks for any help!

How do you trust yourself while drinking?

It's been almost 3 weeks since my last cigarette and by Christmas I'll be 1 month smoke free. I either don't get cravings anymore, or they're so minor that they don't even register. Things are going well.

That said, the holidays are coming up and I know I'll be having a few drinks at Christmas/New year's parties. I haven't had a drink since I quit, mostly just because I've been too busy lately, and I'm worried that if I get drunk over the holidays then I might slip up.

Not drinking isn't a solution. Well, I guess it is but it's not one I like. I just don't want to feel like I'm having to deprive myself of things I'd usually enjoy doing in order to stop smoking. That just reinforces the belief that I need to smoke to enjoy life, which is exactly the kind of thinking I need to get rid of if I'm going to make this change permanent.

What tips do you guys have for surviving the holidays, or just going out drinking in general?

It's crazy...

I'm on day 46 and most of the time it has been pretty easy not to smoke.

The thing is, that i have such good memories of smoking. When i think about cigarettes i don't think that it's disgusting to smoke, like nonsmokers obviously do.

This may seem weird, but I dreamt of smoking a cig about once a week since i stopped. The first weeks I felt guilty in my dream and threw it away, last week I finished it^^.

What do you guys think? Could this be the first dangerous phase to start again? Is this even a phase? Did you have similar experiences 1 and a half month in? Will the positive feeling about cigarettes ever go away?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

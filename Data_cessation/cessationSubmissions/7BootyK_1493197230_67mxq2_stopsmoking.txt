The Reason why You FAIL to QUIT!

Because you've been brainwashed to believe that it's hard to quit smoking. I encourage everyone here to read Allen Carr's EASYWAY to Stop Smoking. The book PROMISES to make you STOP SMOKING FOREVER WITHOUT HAVING ANY WITHDRAWALS! I read it and I've quit smoking successfully. I have no tobacco cravings or withdrawals AT ALL. I mean, you can smoke all day in front of me and I would still not crave for it. I can even hold a cigarette between my lips and not smoke it. MY DESIRE TO SMOKE IS GONE COMPLETELY. Please guys, if you're struggling with this puny little "addiction", read the book. Please!

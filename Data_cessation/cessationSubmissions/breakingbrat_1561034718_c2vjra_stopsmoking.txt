How to make my mom stop smoking

Is there anything that someone said to you that got you thinking? She is 50yo, both on her mother's and father's side there is a history of cardiovascual diseases. Her dad had two infarctions. She is overweight. This week our family friend passed away at the age of 55 (he was also overweight and smoked; he died during sleep due to cardiac infarction). 

I study medicine, I know a lot about how unhealthy her lifestyle is. I could explain it to her to a molecular level, but i don't think it would work. 

I am geniually worried about her and I don't want to lose her, not yet. 

Do you have any advice for me? How should I approach this?

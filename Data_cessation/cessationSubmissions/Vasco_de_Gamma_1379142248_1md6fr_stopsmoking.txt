One Week Down

So, I've got one week down on my quest to completely rid myself of these horribly awesome things called cigarettes. Even though my smoking is totally linked with my drinking, last night I went out for several beers with friends (who all smoke) and while I no doubt had cravings, I didn't smoke, and me quitting smoking didn't dominate my thought process or the conversations I had. 

But as I walked home I started thinking about smoking and how much I honestly love it. It's weird. It's really weird to totally love a five minute habit that inevitably kills faster. But I must admit, I still do love cigarettes, but at this point in my life, I don't need them anymore. I used to refer to them as 'study breaks' or 'writing meditation' because I had honestly convinced myself part of my ability to write, and write well, was somehow, someway linked to cigarettes. But fuck that. 

And god damn that feels fucking great to say. Cheers to everyone in this subreddit who keeps positivity and encouragement flowing day in and day out.

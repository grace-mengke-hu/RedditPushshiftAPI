Hi all,

My first post here. I quit smoking cold turkey Sunday afternoon after 14 years of smoking. 

I'm weirdly surprised at how much easier it is. I mean, yes it is insanely hard and I do want to smoke but I was expecting like sweats and headaches and more physical side effects. 

I did end up buying a vape with zero nicotine juice to help the "habit" part of it. That seems to he going extremely well.

I did notice starting on day two I have a red spot on the roof of my mouth that is insanely sensitive to the touch and painful. Has anyone experienced weird mouth stuff after quitting?

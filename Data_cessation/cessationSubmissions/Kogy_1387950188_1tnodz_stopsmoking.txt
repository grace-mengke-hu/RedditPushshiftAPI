Why I've decided to stop...

I had been considering quitting because it's expensive and smells bad sometimes, but I never really realized how bad it smells until today.

I arrived at my grandparents house for christmas (they are nonsmokers), and when I unpacked my clothes, they REEKED of smoke. Everything. Even the headphones that I'm wearing. I guess when you get a smokers nose you really have no idea, but seriously everything from my headphones to my backpack to my phone not just smelled, but reeked like an ashtray. 

I had been getting involved with a guy who didn't smoke, and one night he confessed that I tasted like cigarettes when he kissed me and that I smelled like smoke whether or not I had smoked one recently.

I guess I just want to be better than that! (And smell better than that)

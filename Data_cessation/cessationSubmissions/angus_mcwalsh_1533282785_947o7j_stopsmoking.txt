Tomorrow is day 1

So tomorrow is the day. The day I become a non smoker. I've had failed attempts before but this time feels different.

I've prepared by getting Champix from my doctor (as recommended by my cousin), but more importantly I've read Allan Carr's EASYWAY. Not trying to sell the book to anyone here but this has put a lot of things into perspective. The part that really hit me was that I'm not quitting anything. I'm not loosing anything. I'm freeing myself from this addiction.

Good luck to anyone who has just started their lives as a non smoker, and well done to those that has beaten the little monster.

Day Zero...

Well, here's my day zero. Really hoping I stay done with smoking for good. I'd love to feel healthy again. I know I am going to regret it highly but cold turkey is the only way it seems to work for me. I just found this sub and decided that my other addiction would probably help kill my unhealthy one. Thank you all in advance. I love you guys.

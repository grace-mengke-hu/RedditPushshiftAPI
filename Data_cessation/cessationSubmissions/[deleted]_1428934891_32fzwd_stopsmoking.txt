Literally coughed up some lung this morning.

I'm so done with this. Today is the day. Day 1. I am a non smoker.

Update: My doctors appointment went terribly. They took some blood but that was about it. I live in a very small town so I have to go to a bigger hospital on Thursday for more tests. They think it could be anything from just a weird one off thing, or something as serious as lung cancer. They put the fear of God in me. I wanted motivation to quit and now I have it. Thank you for all the support!

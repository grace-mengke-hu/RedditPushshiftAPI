Sick more often?

Hi.
It might be bad luck, but ever since I quit smoking I have been very sick of multiple things. I got the flu, I got a stomach ache, I got allegies. Lately I've been feeling bad cravings, more than last week at least. Is this normal?
I've been dreaming also I smoke. 
When will I feel normal again?

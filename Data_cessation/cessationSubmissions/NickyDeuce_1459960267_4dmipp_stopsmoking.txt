Question about nicotine lozenge...

  So I have these nicotine lozenges, and after using them twice, I'm not a big fan.  First it says not to eat or drink for 30 minutes before using one...  Why?  If there is ever a time i crave a square, its after I eat.  The other thing is that the instructions say to switch from one side of the mouth to the other every 5 minutes...  Can I not just suck on it like a piece of hard candy?

  Anyone used these in the past that can give me some advice?

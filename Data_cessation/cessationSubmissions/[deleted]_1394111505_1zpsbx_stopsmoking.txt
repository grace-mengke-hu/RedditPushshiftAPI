I am really going to do it this time.

I am 20 years old and started smoking when I was 15. I really do not enjoy smoking anymore. It was fun back in high school for social reasons. I don't have many friends and the people I am close to don't smoke. My life has been kinda fucked up lately and I think that smoking only made things worse. Currently living paycheck to paycheck and wasting money on cigarettes is stupid. I have been nicotine free for three days now (quit on March 3) and the withdrawal hasn't been too bad compared to the last time I quit. I have also stopped masturbating which has been harder than I thought it would be. Didn't realize how attictive pornography really is. I really want a girlfriend. I am very glad I found this subreddit, looks like a great resource.

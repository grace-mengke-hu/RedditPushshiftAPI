Today I received two coupons in the mail for $2 packs of American spirits.

I quit smoking 55 days ago. I switched to an ecig. Today I ran out of juice and got the coupons around the same time. My mom says it's karma coming around to see if I've learned my lesson. So far I haven't used them. I Might give them away. 55 days is a lot to throw away.

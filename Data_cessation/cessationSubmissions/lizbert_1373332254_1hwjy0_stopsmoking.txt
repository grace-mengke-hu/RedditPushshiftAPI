Day 10 and still having panic attacks...

So I quit smoking about a week and a half ago due to the fact that I began having crippling panic attacks - all spurred by my shortness of breath. Since I quit smoking the frequency of my panic attacks has gone down, but they still come around at the most unexpected (and inconvenient) times. I was wondering if anyone else on this subreddit dealt with something like this, and if so what did you do to overcome  it? I am thinking about seeing someone to get some sort of pill to help when I start freaking out, but don't want to do that if it isn't necessary.

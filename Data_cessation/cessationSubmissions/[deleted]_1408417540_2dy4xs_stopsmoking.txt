Smells

So a plus side of having not smoked for 108 days is that my sense of smell has gotten stronger. So much so that I am now smelling cigarettes everywhere. Even in my own house! And I was the only one who was smoking. I asked my mother if she could smell anything (because she has the nose of a bloodhound and always knew when I smoked no matter how much I tried to mask it) and she couldn't smell anything. Maybe I'm losing my mind. It has been a pretty busy last few weeks. I think I need my vacation next week more than anything.

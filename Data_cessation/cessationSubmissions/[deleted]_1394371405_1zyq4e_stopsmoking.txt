Finally back on the wagon

I quit for 32 days at the end of last year before falling for the oldest self con in the book (I can have just one cigarette and it won't matter). Within 2 days I was back to a 40 a day habit.
Its taken me 2 months since my relapse to finally get back on the wagon again after about 5-6 false starts (fuck the first 24 hours are murderous). I've just made 30 hours and I'm thrilled and determined to continue this quit. For the next couple of days its one hour at a time.

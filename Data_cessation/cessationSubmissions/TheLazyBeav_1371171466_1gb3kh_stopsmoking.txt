3 1/2 Days down- 17 and 1/2 days to go

21 days is about when I became normal again the last time around. Here I am a year later and into this 3 1/2 days. Finally this afternoon I stopped thinking about cigarettes the majority of my time. Still very edgy and haven't slept well since I quit, but I'm confident that this times for good. I'm a non smoker now. Trying to focus on all the life I am gaining!

Forever a lurker but now I need your help.

I have been lurking on reddit for longer than I care to mention but the day has finally come for me to join and the main reason being is because I need your help and want to help you in return. Lets kick smoking in the butt together! 

So...29 hours in and I am going out for drinks tonight and will spend the evening mainly outdoors. Alcohol & open space, am I making a huge mistake?

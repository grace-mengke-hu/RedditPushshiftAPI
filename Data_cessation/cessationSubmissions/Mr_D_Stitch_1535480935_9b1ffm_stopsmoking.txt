Day 12 worse than Day 2

Title is pretty self explanatory.  I’ve wanted a cigarette since I got up at 6am, it’s now 1:30pm.  Im about ready to exchange criminal or sexual acts for a cigarette.  This is way worse than the dreaded first 72 hours, any encouragement is welcome.  Sorry, just needed to vent a bit.

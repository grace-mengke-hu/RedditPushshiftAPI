Just a quick thank you to you all!

I'm one of those people who reads the posts but never actually posts. This year on January the 1st, I stopped smoking cold turkey. After 8 years and approximately 15 cigarettes a day, I decided to stop. Some days are hard and I want to go a buy a packet but the thing that keeps me going is that I'd have to start this all over again. As for side effects, the worst one was the nightmare of smoking and the relief when I woke up that it wasn't true. I can't tell you how disappointed and unhappy I was when I woke up, only for it to turn to utter relief when I realised it was just a dream. Smoking isn't a long-term thing, we either give it up or give in to it! I found every post I read on here incredibly helpful, so thank you!

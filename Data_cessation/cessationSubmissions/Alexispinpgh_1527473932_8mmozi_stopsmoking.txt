I quit 3 months ago. My husband is quitting now and really struggling, I don’t know what to do.

We are trying to have kids. I quit in February in anticipation of this, and he “quit” a little more than two weeks ago but has been sneaking smokes every few days since then. Quitting was hard for me but it’s hard for me to feel like he’s even trying at this point. What should I do? He says he thinks I’m being mean and not supportive but I am genuinely frustrated and don’t know what to do. Is there anything I should be doing?

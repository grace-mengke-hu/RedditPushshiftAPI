Need some advice as college student

 Im 20yo college student, I started smoking when I was 16. In my first college year I used to smoke a pack a day.

 Now in my second year Im able to only smoke one or two a day, still I notice my hair falling and other bad outcomes from this terrible habit as the more I smoke. I really want to put that addiction behind me.

 Problem is that my roommate smokes and we divide a pack between us. Any tips or advices to help me break this habit?

all i can think about is smoking..... why? why cant i just forget about it...

All i can think about is going outside... joining my co-workers and having another smoke. 

I quit... 9 days ago. I feel great, i do NOT regret stopping and am joyful for quiting. I cant help but have this urge to go out and light up and feel that first drag... 

what can i do to stop... to get out of this place in my head that it would feel good. Ive read others whom have had a smoke and regretted it. They wished they didnt have a smoke. They said it wasnt what they though it would be and just worsened it moreso.

I dont think ill make it through the day in the state that i am in.
Writing here and posting everything on my mind about how i feel is barely keeping me inside from going outside into the cold... although it is quite nice and warm out... its a nice day.

is anyone out there ?

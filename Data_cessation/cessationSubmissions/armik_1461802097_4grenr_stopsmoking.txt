Had been having dreams about smoking

I never remember my dreams—I'm in my 30s and can only remember 2 dreams since childhood. With that said, I've woken up 3 times in the past 3 weeks with the very clear thought, "I need to stop smoking and I need to stop smoking NOW." I've quit a few times, and a couple of those times, they were for about 8 months to a year. I have never felt as strong about quitting as I do this time—it's different this time, I feel like for once my body is telling me I need to stop, rather than me trying to tell my body to stop.

Just wanted to share, since it's the first time I've ever posted here.

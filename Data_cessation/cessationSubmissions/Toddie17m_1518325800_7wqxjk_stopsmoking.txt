A listing of 10 things that motivated and continues to motivate me to never smoke cigarettes again!!

1. The Smoke Free app is the best tool I’ve ever used in helping me quit smoking!
2. Reading the forum posts on Reddit helped me realize that I’m not alone in this addiction.
3. Placing a mental image in my head of Tracy, my MIL, that experienced a massive heart attack and stroke due to cigarettes. This horrific event took place right before Christmas. Cigarettes has left her unable to take care of herself and, often, not know anyone, including herself. She is a visual example that even just one puff of a cigarette is harmful.
4. Breathing clean, cold, crisp air in my lungs without a cough!
5. Visualization of saving money in a jar toward something rewarding.
6. My teeth starting to turn white and providing me higher self esteem!
7. Accomplishing more in a day. Taking breaks to relax rather than smoke!
8. Setting an example for my loved ones to stop NOW!! NO excuses!! Don’t put it off. I did and have been through Hell during my quitting process! I’m thankful that I was fully tested in my commitment to stop smoking. Those hard times reminded me that willpower is as strong as you make it! 
9. I appreciate my sense of taste and smell!
10. I’m looking forward to a long, healthy life with Steven, my SO of more than 13 years!

I hope someone finds some inspiration in this posting! Like a mantra that I picked up on here is NOPE (Not One Puff Ever)!! God Bless!

What worked for you?

I've been smoking since I was 14 and I am nearing my 22nd birthday. I think the longest I quit was for about two weeks. As of recently, I've tried using nicotine patches and vaping. I do love the dreams I get from nicotine patches, but they make me nauseous and dizzy. (Which makes me not want to smoke though?) and I'm not sure if the vape pen I got is set up weird or something? But it burns my throat so bad I can't handle it. 

I'm just wondering how you did it. Did you quit cold turkey? I hear the gum is gross but I've never tried that. Haaallllppp.

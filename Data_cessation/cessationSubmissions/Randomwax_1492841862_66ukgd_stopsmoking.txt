95 hours in and struggline

Hi guys, 

I'm on day 4 of not smoking cigarettes.  

It's 6pm on a Saturday night and I'm really struggling. I have an assignment due at midnight and I'm only 1/3rd of the way through. 

I'm still vaping away but man it's getting tough, I wish it was getting easier but I just can't focus.
 All I want to do is have a smoke and go to bed. 

Motivation please? 

Thankies

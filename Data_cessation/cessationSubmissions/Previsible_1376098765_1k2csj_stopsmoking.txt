I want to quit, but I've found it difficult to stick to it.

Hi there /r/stopsmoking 

I'm a repeat offender when it comes to quitting, I quit once for a year and about 3 times for a month or 2. 

I'm SERIOUS about quitting, I want to SO bad, especially after I was pregnant (I got in trouble for trying to quit cold turkey because prior to my 'oops I'm pregnant' I was smoking over a pack a day suffered migranes ended up needing an MRI and was in caffiene withdrawal as well) Apparently you aren't supposed to go cold turkey while pregnant (miscarriage etc) so I managed to cut down to less than 3 a day by the end of my pregnancy (by taking a half cig every time I started to feel sick or funky)

But the moment baby was out it was like a growing trend, from 3 a day up to 5 a day and now 6 months later I'm on a half pack a day. We don't smoke in the house and I've had contact dermatitis from washing my hands too frequently (not wanting to expose baby to my nasty habit) 

I'm fed up, but I seem to always slide back into my habit for stupid reasons. In your experience, what was the best way to quit, last year I spent over 200 dollars on e-cigs to test them but most of the vapor I could find was SICKENING, and a lot of the time it didn't "hit" well enough and made me want a cigarette even more.

I want more than anything to set a plan, and quit for good, if I can do it and find a good way maybe my fiance will quit too. (That would basically amount to over 400 dollars a month of extra spending money between the 2 of us)

It's bad enough I'm trying to budget 100 dollars to buy clothing that fits me when if I were to quit smoking I'd be able to buy a whole new wardrobe. It's really eating me up inside. Furthermore, eventually we want to have a sibling for our little angel-- I HAVE to quit by then, I don't want to smoke while pregnant, I'm seriously ashamed I did it the first time even...

Happy Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Cold turkey is suddenly going a lot better.

11 days into cold turkey. It is Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, in a lovely fall, and I have been feeling a bit like smoking. To fight it I have been getting angry with myself, with the addict in me. It wasn't working so well. Today, I got some good advice from my_vape_self, essentially telling me to be kind to my addict. Suddenly, things are going a lot better.

Be kind to your addict. Yeah, I should have known that. Every step forward is a good one.

Happy Canadian Thanksgiving.

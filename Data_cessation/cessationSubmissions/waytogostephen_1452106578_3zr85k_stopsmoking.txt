3 days cold turkey, horrible symptoms

For the last ten years I've been about a pack a day, sometimes more. It's only been three days since I stopped cold turkey, I haven't been at all irritable and I've been sleeping fine but I've been getting anxious to the point where I find myself clenching my jaw, pretty intense nausea and stomache cramps. I'm just wondering if anyone had any advice, does using nicotine substitutes for example make these other symptoms less harsh?

Third time's a charm, right?

Quitting cold turkey today. I quit for 6 months last year the same way, so I know I can do it. I just need to stop thinking of cigarettes as a "reward" and I have absolutely no idea how to go about that other than continuously say to myself out loud "I hate cigarettes". Haha. Wish me luck! I'm glad I found this subreddit, there's some great threads with awesome advice for coping. I can do this!

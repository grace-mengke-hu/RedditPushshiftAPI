Smokefree.....just

Last night was rough.  Had some serious cravings whilst out with friends (first time I've been out drinking since I quit).  Was convinced I only needed one puff and it was all I could think about the entire night.  The smell of cigarettes on peoples breath repulses me now and it helps me suppress my craves - last night it didn't help.  All the things I usually do to help did not work and the cravings went on and on, getting stronger and stronger.... 
 
When I woke this morning the first thing I thought of was thank god I didn't give in - I'm still smoke-free.  But tell me am I ever going to be able to go out drinking without having these cravings?? I hope so because I don't want to go through that every time I go out to enjoy myself.

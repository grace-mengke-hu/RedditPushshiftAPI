Stairs are AWESOME!

Hey Guys,

I'm super excited that I keep sharing this with people who have quit smoking that I thought I would share this with you! I have been smoking for 9 year before I quit cold turkey on September 1. I started running for about a month before I quit, and now I am pounding out 6K walk/run combinations. Before I quit, I hated stairs. I would be so out of breath by the time I got to the top, I could barely have a conversation with someone. Last night I had a conference call that I took from home. While I was listening to the call I was cleaning the house and walking up and down the stairs to bring up laundry, bring down laundry, bring up the vacuum, etc. I NEVER had to worry about covering my mic so that they wouldn't hear me out of breath. OMG it was awesome. It's no big deal to go up and down stairs over and over again. I was even talking and going up the stairs!!! 

THIS IS AMAZING!

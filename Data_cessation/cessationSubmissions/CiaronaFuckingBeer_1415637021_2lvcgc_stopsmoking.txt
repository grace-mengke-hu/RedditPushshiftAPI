Gunna give stopping a go, just wanted to ask a question

I decided on Saturday that I would try and stop for good, I'm using nicotine gum and it's going pretty well, but I know it's still early days. I just wanted to ask how far into quitting did you guys feel the worst cravings so I can prepare myself!

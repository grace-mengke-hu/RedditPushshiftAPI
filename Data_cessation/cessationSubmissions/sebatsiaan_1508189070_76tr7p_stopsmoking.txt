Question from a starting smoker

I didn't start smoking until last summer, now I smoke like one time a week but i'm feeling this is going to escalate real fast if i'm not quitting soon. I can last without cigarettes for days but booze is my ultimate trigger, how do I prevent becoming a permanent smoker, do you guys have any advice on this subject?

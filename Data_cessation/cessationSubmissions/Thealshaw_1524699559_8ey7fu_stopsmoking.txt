Smoking on the weekend.

So i have been going out and partying the last 3 weekends and after I get loose from alcohol I would smoke a cig. Then after the weekend is over I would have to go through the cravings again but at least I hadn't smoke when I am not drinking. So I am planning to go out this weekend partying without alcohol since it's my gateway to undoing all the good work that sober me does. What do you guys think. Have you been through this ?

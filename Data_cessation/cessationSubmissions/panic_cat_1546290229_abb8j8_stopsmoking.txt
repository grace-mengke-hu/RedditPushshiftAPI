Your favorite mantras?

I've been in the process of quitting for 2 years now, with weeks off and weeks on, sometimes smoking once a day, sometimes not for a week, sometimes binging a pack in one day.

I've found that quitting is a matter of employing every trick and tool at my disposal. Addiction is a crafty enemy!

One mantra that has helped me recently is:

"Every cigarette you don't smoke is a victory."

I tell myself this when I'm craving a smoke. It feels great to follow through and not smoke. Smoking becomes a defeat, not smoking, a small victory.

What are some of your favorite mantras?

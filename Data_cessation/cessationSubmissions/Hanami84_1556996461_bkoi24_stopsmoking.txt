Spikes of irritability

It has been 1 month and 3 weeks since I quit. Cravings were ok after a few days, but I really had severe mood swings which affected my husband and my small children. I started feeling better 10 days ago and I thought that finally my old chilled self was back. However in the past 48 hours I felt as irritable and angry as the first week. I feel quite guilty mostly towards my children. Any thought on how long this emotional rollercoaster lasts?

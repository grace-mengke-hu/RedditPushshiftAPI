It would have been a year

So today would have been a year since I gave up smoking last, but for reasons I can't even justify or work out, I started again at the end of August this year. 

So today, on the anniversary of my most successful attempt ever, I am starting again! I could kick myself, but I wont. I know that I've got it in me to do it again. I just have to not start again next August. Jesus, that seems so far away anyway.

So now it's back to getting through all those doubts and worries about what life will be like without cigarettes (oh, how soon we forget). Today has been fucking tough, and even though i've only restarted smoking for a month now, It quickly became a 15 a day habit again. 

I've binned all my tobacco, papers, and filters. Hidden the ashtrays and lighters out of sight. I'm going to fucking do this. Right. Now.

I don't suppose anyone really cares, but it's nice to write these thoughts down in a place where people understand. Probably.

Bye for now!

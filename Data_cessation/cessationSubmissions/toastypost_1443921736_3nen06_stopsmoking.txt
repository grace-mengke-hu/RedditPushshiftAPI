First night not smoking!

Four months ago I decided to eat a Ketogenic diet and it has been amazing for mental health, two months ago I quit smoking marijuana and it pulled me out of my depression! I haven't had any alcohol for two weeks and tonight is the night I quit smoking :) this is the last step!

Thoughts on e-cigs.

So I quit smoking at the beginning of the month. It was tough at first but after about a week or so I didn't think about it anymore. I just exercised, read, cooked awesome food, smoked a couple joints and some other stuff to keep my mind occupied. Anyway, things were going great until I went to this street festival thing where they were giving away promotional e-cigs. I thought meh, why not? I only smoked it about a dozen times over the course of a day or two then forgot about it. Low and behold I started getting my cravings back. I was not really satisfied by the e-cig and it just made me want the real thing. FUCK!
I decided I would start the process over again and quit the e-cig by taking it apart to see what was inside, essentially by ripping the guts out. There was an LED, a battery, a heating coil and cotton soaked in brownish liquid, all contained in a stainless steel tube. This liquid did not smell very good and I get a bit on my finger tips. The smell would not come out for hours! It made me think. What kind of crap is in that liquid? Sure you are just inhaling vapor, but that vapor contains nicotine, flavorings and who knows what kind of other garbage. 
I've heard a lot about e-cigs on this sub and just wanted to say that if you are going to quit just do it. An e-cig still contains nicotine which is the substance that got you addicted in the first place. More nicotine is only going to keep you hooked. You and I don't need it in our lives. Period.

Has anyone encountered serious acne after quitting smoking? It's honestly making me depressed

So, I quit smoking cigarettes about 3 months ago. Relapsed, then quit again almost 3 weeks ago. 

I've been breaking out all around my mouth and chin. I even tossed away my vape because I thought it could be the culprit, but lo and behold -- more pimples come in. 

Doesn't seem like quit zits to me. I've suffered from acne as a teen and I was so depressed that my social life plummeted. Now it's like I'm reliving that nightmare again.

It's sounds incredible foolish and silly, but this is making me want to run to the store and buy a pack of cigs.

I guess this is here because I want to vent, or maybe some of you have similar stories  or advice.

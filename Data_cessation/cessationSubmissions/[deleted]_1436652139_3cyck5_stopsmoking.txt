Quit Yesterday.

Going to get a badge now. Holy shit it's hard when you work at night and everything is all quiet and usually have nothing to do. 

Replaced smoking with water, or just going outside and get some fresh air for 1-2 minutes.

To be honest, I felt pretty weak because if I could not even stop smoking, how would I be the person that I'm trying to become in the future? Get a good job to provide for myself, my loved ones, do stuff that I want to do etc.

None of it will happen if smoking drains my energy slowly until it reaches to a point where I'll start breathing like a dog after going up 10 steps of stairs.

Used to smoke 2 packs a day, then reduced to 1 pack until I got it to 5-6 cigs a night (my shift starts at midnight) then quit. Quitting alcohol at the same time makes it worse I guess.

Sorry my post has no structure or any main idea whatsoever. I just typed whatever came to my mind. Plus I'm sweating ice cubes here, it's so hot though.

4.5 hr train journey with an exam at other end...

..and I feel completely relaxed that I won't be able to smoke on the train. 


I should be out there in the snow dragging away till the last possible moment. Instead I'm chilling in the warm with a cup of tea and revising my textbook. Feels pretty, pretty good!


Plus my dog had an operation under general anaesthetic, and I was worried sick. Still didn't smoke! This is getting a helluva lot easier now, guys!

Got me some of that Bupropion, making an honest effort for once.

I quit for about 2 weeks in November, and went full back into it.  My doctor prescribed me some Bupropion to help me quit.  I have been taking it for a little over three weeks.  I started fresh on Wednesday and made it through two nights of drinking without any cigarettes, then on Sunday I bought a pack, had three and threw the rest out.  Starting over today, but I really enjoyed my accomplishment last week, so I'm looking forward to doing it again.  

Don't really notice the drugs making a difference, they've kind of made me extremely moody and shaky w/ caffeine, I think, but after I wasn't smoking last week it started to balance out.  So here goes.  Figured I'd post here and see if anyone had experience with the drug or had any questions.

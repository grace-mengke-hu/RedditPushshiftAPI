I had a dream..

I had a dream last night that I smoked a cigarette. I remember that, in my dream, I didn't even realize what I was doing. It was a totally involuntary action. Then, in my dream, I was really upset with myself that I had smoked and felt like I had no control over it. Then I woke up and I was really mad and confused.

I've been a smoker for the last 9 years and I'm having a really easy time with not smoking. I rarely even think about it.

Has anyone else experienced similar things? Do these dreams eventually stop?

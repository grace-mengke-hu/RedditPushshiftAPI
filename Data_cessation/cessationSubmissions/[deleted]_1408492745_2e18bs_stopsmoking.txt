I don't want to quit

I've been smoking for about 4 years now. I started when I was 13, you do the math. I'll be turning 18 in less than a year, which means I'll be able to legally purchase cigarettes. I feel like that will be the point of no-return (or at least quitting will be much harder once cancer sticks become easily available to me). I desperately want to quit before then, but at the same time I don't want to quit. I know that has a lot to do with chemical addiction but how do I keep up the motivation to quit? Sometimes I'll have a really miserable day and I'll think to myself "I don't really want to live that long anyway" and I''ll light up my trusted cigarette, the harbinger of an early death. Typically I'll only feel like that for a day, but that's certainly enough time to fall off the wagon. I guess my problem is I'm trying so hard to quit because the rational side of me knows its the right thing to do. I've gotten into working out lately and I'm trying to live a more active lifestyle. Cigarettes make it so much harder to achieve this goal. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has this same problem? I know all the reasons I should quit but I don't completely want to quit.

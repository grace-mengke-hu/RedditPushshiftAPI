Quitting and drinking... How?

So I'm fine when I don't drink.  I can deal with every craving. I feel great and I feel like I'm a freaking nonsmoking champion. Put a little alcohol in me and I fold like a little baby. I'm pretty upset with myself. I enjoy drinking a pint or two but maybe I need to quit both for awhile before I can stay quit. Probably best. Just bummed. Sorry for the lack of any real point, just needed to vent. My mouth tastes like a freaking ashtray but I know that I'll be stepping outside again in a few minutes. Damn it!

Day 9. I had a slip but I'm good and not resetting!

I slipped on Saturday after drinking wine at home. It had been a long day with family celebrating a birthday, and I let my guard down. It was my first real craving in a week. 

BUT. I only smoked 2. And I didn't actually want or enjoy either of them. The second I only smoked for good measure. Previously I would have binge smoked the pack before starting over. So for this reason, and the fact that I got right back on the horse and didn't look back, I'm keeping my day 9 badge. I've earned these 9 days and I am NOT a smoker. 

Despite the subject of this post I'm pretty damn proud of myself!

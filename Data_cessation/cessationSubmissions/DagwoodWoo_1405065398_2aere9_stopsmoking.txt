Allen Carr's Easy Way seems to have helped

So here I am on my nth quit attempt (can't remember how many, actually), and I failed at all of them. The other day I read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking (or actually listened to it as an audio book) and since then I have been happily smoke free (only 51 hours...but still).

The crazy thing is that during previous attempts I've felt absolutely miserable during the first 3 days and this time I'm actually enjoying them. I used to think that the withdrawal symptoms were terrible, but now I think he's right: they are very mild. You should try to enjoy yourself even during these first days...

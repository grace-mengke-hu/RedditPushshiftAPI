The time has come, day 1.....

Here's to the beginning of a new life. It's gonna be hard, but I've got everything to lose here. I am viewing this battle as a break up. The first week is gonna be hell, but keep your mind occupied and you'll survive. I guess I'm giving up on something. But that something wants to kill me, make me smell bad and take my money. It's the world's most notorious killer, and yet it's legal. Time to save myself.

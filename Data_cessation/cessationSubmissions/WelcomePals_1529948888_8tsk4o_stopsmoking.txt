~85% of Adult Americans Don't Smoke

This statistic helped several friends and family members stop smoking so I thought I'd just pass it along.

Whatever reason you have for starting and continuing, many of the 85% have faced similar challenges. Many of the 85% were offered cigarettes at a young age and even started smoking. Many of the 85% have insanely stressful lives. Many of the 85% are pressured to smoke by friends while drinking. Yet they don't smoke.

When I ask smokers what percent of adults smoke, they tend to guess over 50%. Normalizing the addiction makes it easier to keep going. But when they realized MOST people don't smoke even though MANY of them have gone through similar things as them, it really helps it click that they need to stop.

I'm not trying to preach. I certainly have my struggles too. But I thought I'd throw it out there in case it helps.

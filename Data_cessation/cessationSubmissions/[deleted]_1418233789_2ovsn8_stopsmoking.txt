I don't know how I know, but I know... I AM QUIT.

I've tried before.  I've done all the things the experts tell you to do, like setting a date, cutting back, the patch, on and on.  The only thing I learned was that there are an awful lot of "experts" out there.  

This time I really didn't plan it.  I didn't psych myself up to it.  I've known for quite a while that it's been time to stop, and so a few days ago, rather than making my usual run to the Quickie Mart for a pack, I just kept driving.  I said out loud, "Na, screw it, I'm done". 

I was a committed smoker.  My first cigarette was within 60 seconds of consciousness in the morning and it was the last thing I did before sleep each night.  And I would scheme all day over how to fit one in - excuses like going to check the mail, or running errands.  That was my whole life.  My God, that sucked.

I can tell you that it isn't easy.  I have lots of triggers, even more than I expected.  But there is something that I picked up in my research which I have found to be true.  The hard cravings only last for a few minutes, so I ask myself, "Is success worth these next five minutes?"  

I have never gone this long without smoking and although its only been a few days, I can feel a change, I feel like I'm getting more air.  I don't notice an increase in energy, but I know it's coming.  It's one of the things on my list to look forward to.

I want everyone who is reading this post to succeed.  I want to succeed.  I will succeed.  For me, it comes down to moments, and the realization that I am stronger than an urge.  I'm able to hold off for the few minutes it takes for the worst of a craving to pass.  It's worth it.

Best of luck to my fellow quitters!

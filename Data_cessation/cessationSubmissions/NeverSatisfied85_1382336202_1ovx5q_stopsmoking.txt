1 WEEK! I feel antsy and I'm caffeinated all the time.

Well I made it a week.  I found out among candy, sunflower seeds and anything edible, caffeinated soda is what really keeps me going.  Thanks for this sub and the peeps that are in this with me.

Also when do the random cravings go from a daily occurrence to a weekly / monthly thing?  I've been smoking for the past 6 years 1-2 packs a day.

Looking forward to the future is whats really pushing me along.  But not knowing what to expect is kinda like walking in the dark.

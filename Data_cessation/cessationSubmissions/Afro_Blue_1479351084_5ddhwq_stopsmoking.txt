Quit smoking two weeks ago, still have bad breath!

So its been two weeks and I honestly think my breath has gotten worse.  My girlfriend never mentioned me having bad breath while I smoked but now she says it is pretty bad.  I can also almost taste the bad breath in my mouth. Has this happened to you??

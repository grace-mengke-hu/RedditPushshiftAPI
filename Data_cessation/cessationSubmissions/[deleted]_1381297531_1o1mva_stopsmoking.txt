Day Four, my triggers became more apparent.

I used to smoke while I drove, anywhere. I almost never got in my car without a cigarette in hand... I drove a lot today, had to go all the way across town. It was really hard, I probably chewed at least 5 pieces of gum. It was raining REALLY hard which made it easier, because it would have been a pain to smoke, if I even had any.

Also, my boyfriend and I got into it REALLY bad... fighting about things we haven't talked about in months... it was really emotional. He is a smoker, however, and he smoked a couple (which I was okay with, I surprisingly didn't get too tempted by that, however I did want one. He offered me one and I easily declined. 

Finally, we decided to go out to our favorite diner--the one we've been going to for the past four years... unfortunately, I forgot that every time we went there we would order, step out for a smoke, eat and then share another smoke before going home. That was hard, but not unbearable.

Overall though, I did it. It is certainly getting easier already. There were actually some times today where I didn't even think about smoking... Four days down, cold turkey, and I could not be happier with myself!

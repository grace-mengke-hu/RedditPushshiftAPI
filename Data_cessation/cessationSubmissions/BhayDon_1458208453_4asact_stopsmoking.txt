Day 1... Suggestions.

so here i find myself on 'day 1 of not smoking, Again..'
not sure what im doing wrong but every time i cave in, i have enough reasons to quit smoking i just cant get over the final hurdle when it comes down to it!! (usually cave in at work). Any advice on how to overcome? (open minded) i haven't tried any Nicorette products yet, maybe thats the next step?

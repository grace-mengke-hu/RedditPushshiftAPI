24 hours in...

So, I used to be a social smoker - which led to smoking (at my worst) about 10-15 a day, though some days I could go without having any. I decided about 2 years ago to switch from smoking to vaping, which worked - in that 2 years I probably had less than 10 cigarettes (mainly on nights out when my vape battery had died).

About a month ago, I realised that I would be doing this forever, and decided to give up vaping. In a moment of inspiration on the way back from the gym, I threw all of my vaping gear into a bin, and decided to give up both. I lasted 24 hours before I had one of my girlfriends cigarettes and since then I've gone back to about 10 a day - as I don't have any vaping gear left!

I've now decided to give up again. On Saturday night, at about midnight as me and the girlfriend were getting ready for bed, I decided enough was enough. I went downstairs, and had one last cigarette - and then run the rest of the pack under a tap, and threw them in the bin.

I'm currently at 1 day and 11 hours, and i'm feeling the pangs. I'm essentially writing this, just as a distraction, and to reinforce what i'm doing. I had a couple of beers yesterday, at a pub with my girlfriend, and had major cravings - fortunately she didn't have any on her, and so I resisted. The hardest part is what i'm doing now. I'm working my notice at my current job, before I start a new one, my role has essentially been handed over to someone else, and i'm here if they need any support - this involves a LOT of doing nothing at my desk. Boredom makes me want to smoke. 

Hopefully i'll get to 48 hours, which will lead to 72 - and then the pangs will slowly decrease. Thankfully at the moment, the desire to not smoke is still strong (though i'd love one right now - and then instantly regret it).

Apologies for making you read this. It's nothing special, but it has killed 5 minutes, and just reinforced the point that I really don't want to smoke again :)

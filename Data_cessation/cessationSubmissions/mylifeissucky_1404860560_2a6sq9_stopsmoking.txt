I was getting SO addicted to cigarettes that...

I nearly became a Junkhead, smoking any random dust and shit that was around the house. I never did though. 

Junkhead: Def; One who smokes whatever is around the house, be it random dust, papers and other random scraps, food, other miscellaneous plastic pieces and what not.

 Thank GOD I quit before it could get this far. I could feel myself getting closer and closer to being aforementioned junkhead.

How I EVER stopped smoking COLD TURKEY and basically on a dime beats me.

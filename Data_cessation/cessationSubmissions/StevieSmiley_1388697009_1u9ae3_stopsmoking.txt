day 75 and tomorrow will be 2 miles

So this is my hope. I've quit now for 75 days and feel real good. for the last 5-6 weeks I've been jogging ( first few without any training program ) Yesterday I jogged 2 stretches of  3/4ths miles with walking a half mile in between. Something I thought was near impossible until I tried it. Tomorrow calls for 2 miles without stopping. My brain is telling me I'll collapse, since I smoked for 25 years. WISH ME LUCK!

**EDIT:** [I DID IT!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuULcVaMTf0) ( just a bit slower, and less dramatic though LOL )

The line that got me to stop smoking immediately

So last month I was at the grocery story, I had picked up some produce and meat and whatnot, I had also picked up a box of Ajax. Incase you don't know, Ajax is powdered bleach, and obviously very toxic to a person. I had also asked for a pack of ciggs. When you bag groceries, you don't put non-food items with food, like you'd NEVER put something like Ajax with your produce. So the bagger correctly separated my items, except for one thing. He got a bag and put the Ajax and cigarettes in it. I said "Hun don't mix consumables with Bleach"
And then he said
"In this case, does it matter?"

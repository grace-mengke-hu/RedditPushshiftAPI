Odd situation, hopefully you guys can help me out

So a little bit about me. I am almost19 years old and I have started working construction. I have been working it for about a year and literally everybody on the site smokes except me. I always hated the thought of smoking and the smell. 

Well at first on the job site I hated the fact that every body smoked and I always had to smell it, but after a while, I started getting used to the smell, and by 6 months in I was starting to like it. Now every time I smell one I get this weird feeling and for some reason I just crave the smell and I want a cigarette even though I don't.

 I didn't know it was possible but it would appear that I became partially addicted without actually smoking.

If you guys could offer any advice I would really appreciate it. I have a bad feeling that I might brake down and smoke one even if I don't want to.

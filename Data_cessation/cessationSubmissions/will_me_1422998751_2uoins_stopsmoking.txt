5ish months, but today had a craving like day 1

The craving was so bad i could feel it in my whole body and it knocked me sideways. I only every remember it being that bad in the first few days. It kind of scared me, and came here to help distract myself. Not sure why that happened but it did, and am I little worried it will come back as strong again after I thought they were pretty much gone :(

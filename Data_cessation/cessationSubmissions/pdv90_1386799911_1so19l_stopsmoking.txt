Hello, I quit.

It has been 16 days since my last smoke, and Ive been a feverish, coughing mess for the majority of this time. So much chest pain and pleghm..

Im going to my grandfather's funeral this weekend. He never smoked a day in his life, but ended up dealing with brain and lung cancer for the last 3 years. He put up a good fight. And his last words to me were to be happy. Smoking does not make me happy. It makes me feel guilty because I try to quit so often in my life but always convince myself that I will fail. And then I give up. So here's to finding a new subreddit; may we all achieve our goals.

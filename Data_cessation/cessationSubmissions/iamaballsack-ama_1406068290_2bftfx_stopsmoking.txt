I just smoked my last cigarette.

Because I always put my cigarettes out early anyway, and I can't run a half mile without WHEEZING (RE: making an involuntary shriek sound when I exhale, but that's totally cute right?). I have two roommates who smoke in the house, so I really need somebody from an outside perspective to hold me to my word. This sub is perfect. I am so excited to be free.

Tried stopping many times in last decade. How do I win?

So, I love smoking, I hate smoking, and I want to stop. I haven't drank alcohol in 5 years, or used drugs... Yet Nicotine owns me.

I was able to say I was doing good the past 8 years because I went from 3 packs a day to 1 pack a day.. But I am tired of making excuses. I work a LOT and commute a LOT. I want to try again but I honestly do not know how, where it could actually work.  


I ask those who are currently quitting or those who had terrible withdraw symptoms, how you handled it. I need all the help I can get.   


BTW Chantix makes me nuts, it is not an option :(

Smoking my last pack today.

Ive tried to quit a bunch of times before, letting inconveniences in life become excuses to why I need to smoke again. I dont feel that anymore. 

I bought a case of my favorite beer (ive also been significantly cutting back my drinking these past few weeks) and Im gonna finish what I can by the end of the month. 

I bought different dosages of nicotine gum because I hate chewing gum but also dont want to go cold turkey and stress myself out. 

Wish me luck. Any words of encouragement would probably go a long way.

Trouble quitting because of the anxiety that comes when thinking about getting through the next week/month/year etc. Any tips?

I've smoked for 11 years, since I was 15 years old. I hate it. It's a waste of time, money, life, everything. I despise it. I'm done. However the only thing that keeps me from being able to quit is thinking about how I'm going to get through the next day, or week, or month, or year. It's not really the act of quitting and staying quit, it's more the idea of getting through the following time. Does anyone relate? Any tips?

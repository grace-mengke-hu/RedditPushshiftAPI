Fuck. Need advice / encouragement / love

I am on the morning of day 3.  I woke up from a smoking nightmare to missed calls from an east coast area codes.  My grandmother died last night - she was old and died peacefully, so theres alot to be thankful for there.

My question is how do i deal with this.  I am not going back to smoking, i already had that talk with myself this morning.  But i am in a very dark place; my emotions were already on a rollercoaster and everything feels a bit like a waking nightmare.  

I have to head to work, even that seems grueling.  How do i get through today ... How did you guys do it when bad shit happened at this stage of your quit?

completely nicotine free

After a long couple of years, I've finally quit smoking (April 24, 2018) and nicotine gum (March 3, 2019). I can't say I feel much different but it's such a relief not to have to compulsively check for a supply of nicotine gum every time I leave or have that panic that I'm going to run out.

almost three weeks smoke free

I smoked two packs of cigarettes each day. Sometimes more, but never less. At the end I was a junk of nicotine. I stole from my girlfriend to buy cigarettes. I could not go with cigarettes and not without them. I hated the total annihilation of freedom.  i am deeply ashamed about this right now. For now I am almost three weeks smoke free. I want to share a little tip how I am doing it right now. Sharing the things that have helped me. 

1. Nicotine replacement therapy: eases the physical withdrawal. Ten lozenges of 4 mg as prescribed by my general practioner.

2. Powertraining and cardiovascular activity: eases the physical and mental withdrawal. Gives energy. I enjoy it.

3. Allen Carr: not rigurously following its theory. Gave me some nice ideas. i think it is a kind of behavourial cognitive therapy: 

- smoking does nothing
- only reason for smoking is an addiction to nicotine 
- all reasons for smoking are illusions

4. Mindfulness: eases the craving. Letting go of thoughts and feelings. Accepting - or trying at least- the situation like it is. Not trying to force anything. Trying to be patient. I work day per day; tomorrow will take care of itself. But it feels good to be smoke free.

5. smoke free app: monitors the progress (number of days not smoked / number of cigarettes not smoked. Very motivating and daily tips in the form of missions. 

6. consultations Doc: a general practioner ( gives me some tips) and a psychiatrist ( because of my autism spectrum disorder)

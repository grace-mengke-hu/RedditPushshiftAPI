Tomorrow is a new beginning

So tomorrow is the big day. I am eager, anxious, excited and apprehensive. 
I first started smoking at 14 (am now 26). It started as rebellion and 'stress relief', but by 16 I was well and truly in the trap. When I turned 22 my husband and I decided to try for a baby, and I quit. I read Allen Carr's book and 'click', non smoker. No struggles, no pangs, no problems. 
Unfortunately, when my son turned one I spiralled into a depression, and picked up the cigarettes again. But at the beginning of this year, I quit again. Some pangs, some difficulties, but I did it. But as fate would have it, it didn't last. In May I was admitted to the psychiatric ward for a severe depressive episode, and whilst in there, I took up smoking again. 
But now it's time to stop. For good. It is time to improve my life, my wellbeing. I want to be here for my son, I want to have another child, I want to care for myself, not slowly destroy myself. I want to be free of the guilt of being a mother that smokes. I want to learn to ride the ebbs and flows of life without grasping at 'comforts' that just add to the difficulties.
Tonight I am re-reading Carr's book for another boost, and tomorrow will be a new beginning. Wish me luck... please! I think I need it!

What are your personal tips/tricks to defeat the 'trigger'?

Hello. I am a 21 yr old female who has been smoking since the age of 16. In the words of Mark Twain (I think,) "Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times." I really would like to quit because I can tell there's a huge difference in the quality of my life when I'm on and off cigarettes. I only reach for a cigarette when I'm upset by a situation, like an argument with the family or when I'm being bullied at work. From there one becomes two becomes three becomes four. My question is...what are some things that y'all do to calm/distract yourself when you're 'triggered'? What are some personal tips that help bring you down when you're upset instead of reaching for the cigarette?

Thank you

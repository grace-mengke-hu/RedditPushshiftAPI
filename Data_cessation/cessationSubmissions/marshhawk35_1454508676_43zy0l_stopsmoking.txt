Day 52, wrinkles vanishing!

Noticed this for the first time this morning when I was putting on my makeup. First my acne problem went away (took about 3-4 weeks) after years of expensive products and antibiotics that never fixed it.  And now the little lines on my face are fading away - even laugh lines! Dark circles under the eyes are way lighter too. I have changed nothing else other than quitting smoking.

Just one more benefit of giving up those shitty poisonsticks.

6 Months!

Hey Everyone, 

So I'm here and happy to say I've been smoke free for 6 months today! This past month was the hardest since the first month. There were many changes in my life that a year ago would've set me off chain smoking. Luckily, through my own strength and with a lot of hep from this community I'm still here and smoke free. 

Wishing everybody all the best!

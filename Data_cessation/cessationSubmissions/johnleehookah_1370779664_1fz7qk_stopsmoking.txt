Almost at 2 weeks

The toughest time is at 5am after a bunch of whiskey and weed. And besides the nicotine addition to the drug cocktail that was so delicious, it was also the thing that would put me to sleep. Which I would love right now. But I'm too proud of my almost 2 week success. I won't smoke again cause I'm too proud. But this sub helped me through the first few days and I want to help everyone who just quit to know it gets easier. Take pride in every hour when it's early in your cessation. Make that pride more important than the simple body-cravings of "after a meal" or "drunk and stoned"

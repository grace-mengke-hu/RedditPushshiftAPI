That's it, I quit. Fuck smoking.

I stopped tonight at midnight. Everything about smoking is bad for me. It's bad for my health, bad for my relationships, bad for my attention span, general fitness and it takes away my energy to do greater things. I'm 27 years old, have been smoking for 9 years, and have decided to finally level up.

Can anyone give me any tips to help me get through the first week?

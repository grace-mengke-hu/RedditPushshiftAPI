A one, a two, a three...

I'm honestly surprised to see me here like this, 123 days away from that habit.

I smoked from about age 18 until 28. I quit for **26 years!** But the worst year of my life happened and took it's toll. I started smoking again at age 54. It took a lot of work and was very hard to *start* smoking again, but within the year, I was back up to a pack a day. I smoked for two years.

Even at 54, I was/am fit and healthy but jeez... smoking made me feel so old, slow, lethargic and dim-witted. I know my stupor was a lot of the depressing situation that had happened. But smoking again just magnified and locked down that depressed, out-of-synch feeling.

I didn't read AC or anything. I just decided to be a non-smoker again. I set a date, took the plunge and quit March 1st, 2015. I had previously tried vaping and so had all that juice, hardware, plus nicotine gum to fall back on, if I felt desperate. But I only used the gum twice on the first day. I just wanted to be **done** with it all, so no vaping, no nicotine replacement.

All sorts of weirdness ensued - physical and mental. I gained 20 pounds (dammit!) but the food replacement/gorging didn't last long. The best feeling for me was getting to the point of 'forgetting' to light up first thing in the morning. That was the hardest part for me. And Day 58 was a bitch - Never Forget.

Honestly, I quit because of finances. I watched my wee bank account dwindle bit by bit over those two years. It had to be from the leak of a $40-60 per week habit. My little app says I've saved over $700 to date.

Here's my last thing... Every day, I would tell myself 'I really need to quit.' *Every* *Day* I would play out this losing argument with myself about quitting. Then I'd just feel worse and smoke more. What kind of weird game of self-loathing is that? The point is I knew that one day I would quit and I was simply fooling around with the idea, prolonging the game I played with myself - for no good reason. 

I don't always feel I'm totally out of the woods, so thank you to everyone for your stories - they keep me going, keep me mindful.

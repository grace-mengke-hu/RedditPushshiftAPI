I'm quitting tomorrow, SO really shows no support. Need your help!

I know this is bad, this is why I seek your help.

I'm actually 6 months pregnant. I've slowed down from my pack a day to 10, but it's hard to stop. I'm a house girlfriend (not quite wife) so there's nothing to keep myself busy. I'm always bored so that was my reason. I'm tearing up right now as I write this because it hurts knowing how weak minded I am about quitting. My SO doesn't show much reward when ever I did stop for 4 hours (Which is long to me at least) and thinks it's no big deal to quit. I wish he could understand how hard it is to not only be stressed about my upcoming pregnancy and new life, and the pain and discomfort it brings, to only add more stress to quit smoking. 

In the mornings I always have to have a cigarette, but tomorrow changes. I'll soak them in the sink and figure out a way. Not many alternatives being pregnant so I'm just plain out screwed.   Can't walk outside, too hot. Can't relax in a hot tub or hot bath. I have no idea what to do!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone's help and support! Even 6 hours seems like hell but thanks to you guys it's easier to see the greener grass on the other side! The worst of today will be going into work (Bartender where smoking is allowed) but I *know* if I just focus and keep myself occupied I'll be successful for my first day smoke free. I'll look back at these comments whenever I feel I can't make it and realize that I can do it! Thanks once again! Can't wait until I can post "Smoke free for a week" and more!

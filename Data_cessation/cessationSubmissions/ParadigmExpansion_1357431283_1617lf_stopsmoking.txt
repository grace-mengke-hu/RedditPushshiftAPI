Quit smoking + anxiety disorder = Problem? 

Hi, so, erm. 


Yeah, this is awkward. 

I'm only 22, only smoked (about 16 a day) since I was 20. Never really did decide to stop, but did feel like I should stop. Got "the book" when a post from around here made it into /r/all somewhere. Finished it, read and followed all instructions, blabla. 


Other sad note is that I've got a rather massive and ever so crippling anxiety disorder. Always have had it, is unrelated to smoking but it was part of why I started, back in the day. 


While the cravings are annoying but perfectly manageable, and while I know that in a couple days I'll physically feel so so so much better (I'm only about 55 hours in, atm), there's one thing that's really becoming a problem for me - that disorder. 

It's not fear related to smoking in any way, mind you. It's not fear of quitting it or anything. It is however sadly a fact that that anxiety/fear stemming from this lovely disorder is pretty much at an all time high since I quit. I heard something about quitting fucking up your chemical balances in the brain a bit, but don't know anything about that. 


I know I'm being a bit chaotic and messy in typing this - sorry about that. I just have no idea what to do, since I really don't want to go back to smoking and don't even particularly feel like my brain is telling me to go smoke, my anxiety / fear (in general) is... well. Way unmanageable, last couple days.

Anyone know anything about this? Or know anything about the whole thing with the chemicals and how long that stays the case? 

Just looking for a little back up here, if anything! Quitting isn't too hard so far but with this added in, it just becomes so much harder for no real reason. 

Thanks so much in advance, everyone!

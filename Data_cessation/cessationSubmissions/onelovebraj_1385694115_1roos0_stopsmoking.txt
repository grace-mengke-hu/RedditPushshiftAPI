Is smoking hookah a trap?

Hey guys, been completely nicotine free for a little over 9 weeks now and I used to smoke cigs and dip. It's had its ups and downs, but I've been doing well overall. I used to really enjoy going out and smoking hookah with my friends. It's something to do in my boring town. Do you think this is a trap that would get me back into cigs? Using Allen Carr's method/logic (which I used to quit) this is a complete trap and I will become re-addicted pretty quick. But what are your thoughts?

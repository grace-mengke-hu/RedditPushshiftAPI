Day 18 - I spot light in the distance.

Hey guys. 

  I know, I was whining about anxiety just a couple of days ago, so I thought I'd post about something positive for a change. 

  Rest assured, the depression and the anxiety DOES go away. It does. I'm not lying. 

  Day 14 was one long, protracted day of pure panic, anxiety and depression for no reason. 

  Day 15 was a little better. 

  The last couple of days have been... better. A lot better. I smile again. I find myself having an interestin my work again. I don't overthink things. My muscles aren't tense 90% of the day. 

  Do I have moments when my face flushes, my shoulders tense, I start sweating and start wondering about every little thing on earth? Sure. They're still there.
  But they're getting shorter, easier to handle, and fewer in number. 

  I still don't get any cravings. I don't connect any of this to smoking, to me it's just my brain chemistry recalibrating its nerve signals. 

  I still remember day 1 and 2 so vividly I hold my breath when I pass smokers on the street. Why? Out of pure, stark fear. What if there's any left in the second hand smoke that kicks off another two days of pure hell? 

  Nu-uh. Ain't dealing with that, I've got shit to do. One month of being weird will be more than enough. I'm staying quit. 

Thanks for listening and bearing with me.

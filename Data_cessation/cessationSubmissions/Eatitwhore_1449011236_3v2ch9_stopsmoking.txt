Smoke free for 428.1 hours

What helped me get this far without smoking is my supportive boyfriend who understands the struggle of quitting, and telling me that it's ok that I feel the way that I feel. It's kind over matter; if I don't mind, it don't matter. And that's true. 

When I would have a craving, I spray myself with body spray or perfume, so that I can smell like that instead of cigarettes, and both me and others prefer that smell to the smell of cigarettes. Finding the strength within myself instead of someone else is also key. I definitely relied on him when I didn't have the strength, but I knew that would only get me so far. I had to find it within myself; and really admit that I was above all else, an emotional smoker. When things got too hard, or having too many feels, I turned there. Instead, I just feel what I'm feeling, even if that meant humiliating myself and sobbing in front of people... Which I did. I'm lucky. I had a very very understanding and sympathetic support system- composed of nonsmokers, current smokers, and former smokers. All of whom supported my choice to quit. I know how lucky I am, and I'm truly grateful to every single person that supported me, an endured me. 

During this whole thing, I absolutely refused to be an irritable bitch. Which meant I cried... A lot. And being a tired zombie was so difficult, but I knew I would get over it. For the first 2 weekends, I spent that around primarily non smokers, and people who never knew I smoked in the first place: and that was difficult, but I was much less tempted. I avoided situations that would get me smoking again. But everyday, during the times when I would want to smoke the most, I had a plan to do something else. 

Above all else, the only sentence I would say out loud and to myself was "I don't want a cigarette", until it became the truth.

Do withdrawals start immediately?

Quit for my birthday on June 7th; hadn't smoked until last Friday (a month and a day).

The day after I was really feenin, but staved it off. Sunday was better, but today I felt really down in the dumps. Quitting usually makes me really depressed and I can't tell if I'm feeling that or if I'm truly sad.

Anyways, the question I'm asking is: can I trigger withdrawal symptoms from smoking a few cigarettes one night after a month of quitting? I figured it would be a breeze resuming my quitting, but its been tough :|

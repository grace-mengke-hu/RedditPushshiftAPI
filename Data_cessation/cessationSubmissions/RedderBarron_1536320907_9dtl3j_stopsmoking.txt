I fucked up.

So. Friday night. I was out at the pub with the boss and some coworkers. We had some drinks and i was offered a cigarette. I took it cos i was caught up in the moment. 

I only smoked half of it before i realized i was throwing away over 2 1/2 months of progress and butted it. 

Not i feel like absolute shit. Not physically but mentally. I dropped the ball. Im typing this from the pub bathroom. Should i reset the quitting clock on the app?

Day 4 with patch... going fine so far, but am worried about when I go off patch...

How successful is the patch to help one stop smoking? I am using the patch, and it's going fine. But I am also listening to the audiobook version of Allen Carr's Easy Way, and he says that nicotine replacement, like the patch, is a bunch of bs. That makes me worried. I have been doing great for 4 days, but what about when the patch comes off?

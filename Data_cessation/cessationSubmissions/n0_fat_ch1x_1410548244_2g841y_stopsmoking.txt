I just realized it's been a month.

Well tomorrow. But i don't really reddit unless i'm at work, and tomorrow is the weekend. But i seriously did forget its already been a month! It got so easy for me. Ya i still have cravings sometimes, and ya i cant drink a whole lot and still stay away from them. But it's a battle that is worth fighting my whole life if i must, because i am fighting for my life. I have felt overwhealming healthier since i stopped it's insane. I don't smell really bad anymore either. Thank you to all the people on this subreddit though. You are all very encouraging and nice people. Even when we are all going through our mood swings. If you are just starting out or are think of quitting, YOU CAN DO IT! You will love yourself so much more for doing it. I promise you that. Come here when you have trouble that's what i do! so once again thanks to everyone for helping me to this point. And good luck to all of you!

Digging deep.

My 1-year-old daughter is going in for a major surgery tomorrow (Monday). The stress is beginning to soak in. 

I've been quit for over 40 days. Not one smoke. But my wife smokes, and I feel like the next few days will be an enormous test.

I've asked her not to go outside while we're waiting at the hospital, but I'm not sure if that will happen.

I just want to avoid her going outside for a smoke, and me stuck alone in a waiting room with my thoughts throughout a 4- to 6-hour surgery. 

Thoughts?

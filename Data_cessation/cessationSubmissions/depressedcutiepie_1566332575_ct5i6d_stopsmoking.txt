How can I control mood swings with out smoking?

I have already seen my doctor for my issues (schizoaffective disorder), but I also have a lot going on in my life including a full plate at school, family being sued, and my grandmother in the hospital with blood clots in her heart. I want to quit, but should I wait til things get better? I feel like I need smokes to help me. 

I think Iâ€™m really looking for a kick in the ass and some inspiration. Thank you.

Before hubby left he was like "bb I left you some cigs by the bed". Me: Ah yes!! (I completely forgot I had quit like 4 hrs ago lol) BUT what reminded me was this: "A resounding No". Whichever circumstance arises, the answer will always be No. An automatic robot-like no, no thought process involved.

Almost a year

Well February 18th will be a year. I wanted a Gasper for the first time in a long time last night. I did not smoke but I wish I did not get that urge ever. I know better just one could avalanche, and I would be back to the pack plus a day. Twenty years of a pack a day is done for good. 

I recommend why quit.com lots of info, it helped in knowing why I felt the way I felt when I quit.

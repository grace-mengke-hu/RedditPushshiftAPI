Just ordered the Allen Carr book.

I've been lurking for a bit and posted on here once in a drunken stupor. About half of you have recommend this Allen Carr book on your posts/comments so I'm just gonna go for it. Gonna download the smoke free app and set a quit date based upon when I get the book. Looking forward to getting my singing voice back and my stop smoking badge. Cheers!

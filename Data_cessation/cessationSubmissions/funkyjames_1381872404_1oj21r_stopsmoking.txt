Hi guys. I'm trying to quit, any advice?

Hello everybody. This looks like a pretty useful place for those of us trying to quit, so I have decided to make an introductory post. My name is James and today will be the day I try to quit smoking.

The times I smoke the most are when I'm driving my car and when I am drinking at the bar/club/party.

Can you guys offer any tips to make it easier/more successful for me?

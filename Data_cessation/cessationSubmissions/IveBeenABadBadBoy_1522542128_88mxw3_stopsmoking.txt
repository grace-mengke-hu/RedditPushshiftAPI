Help identifying withdrawal symptoms vs a fever Iâ€™ve had this week

Hi! Iâ€™m currently on day three!!ðŸ˜Š

I got sick 4 days ago and my throat began getting so sore that I couldnâ€™t even chew Nicorette without it hurting, the pain of smoking or vaping was unreal haha, so I decided this is the perfect opportunity to force myself to quit! Iâ€™m still kinda sick but getting better but I have a killer headache that is only getting worse (and I never get head aches when sick), so I assume that itâ€™s the withdrawal. How long did you guyâ€™s headaches last?? Iâ€™m dying ðŸ˜© 

Iâ€™ve still got a lot of symptoms that could either be associated with getting over my fever, or the withdrawal from nicotine. What was your withdrawal like? I want to know which of these symptoms belong to which issue lol. 

What helped your withdrawal? Advil? Any natural remedies? I start a new quarter in three days and really need to be as on top of my game as possible. 

Thanks so much!

Once a pack and a half a day smoker for 40 years, to 1800 days totally cigarette and nicotine free. What a frickin' miracle. Tried and failed every possible method to quit. Finally got to read Allen Carr's book, "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" and quit like I turned off a switch. Not sayin' it's for everyone but why not read it. Cost me $19.99, cheapest method I've tried and it WORKED!! Saved over $23,400.00 so far. Added a few years to this old body too. If you're struggling, if you think you can't quit, maybe give this great book a shot. It sure helped me become a permanent non-smoker. Never going back. Peace everyone, stay strong, stay quit. The human body does not require nicotine. No one ever died from nicotine withdrawal or a craving, you won't either.

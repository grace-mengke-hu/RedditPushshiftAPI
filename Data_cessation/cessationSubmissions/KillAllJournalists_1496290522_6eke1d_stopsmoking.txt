Smoker of 5 years, trying to quit

I've been a smoker for the last five years; and not just a smoker but a chain smoker. At my peak I was going through three packs of spirits a day, but even today I'm going through two packs of L&M Turkish and an additional AS Blue. 

I want to quit so badly, not just because I want to avoid cancer, but because smoking has drained my finances more than anything else ever has. 

Please help and give me any information I can get. I just discovered this subreddit and haven't lurked it, but I need this and any help is appreciated.

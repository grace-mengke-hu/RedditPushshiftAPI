Day 6

This is probably the 12th time I've been on Day 6. I've attempted quitting smoking perhaps about 12 times. Over the years, I've watched friends quit, and stay quit, but for some reason, I just have it bad! One thing I've never done in my previous attempts at quitting is get help and support from other people who've quit or are quitting. I tend to think I can just power through on my own. But as I was reading through posts here, I saw someone mention that one thing that helps to quit is to have a buddy — like, a litter mate who quit around the same time — and I just imagine that would be incredibly helpful.

Anyway, it's Day 6, and I feel a ton of anxiety and just sort of globally depressed. I don't necessarily feel like smoking at all, but I keep forgetting that the anxiety-depression-apathy is just part of the withdrawal process for me. 

I appreciate that this subreddit is here... I joined reddit just so I could be a part of it! I'm looking forward to reading more and connecting. Thanks for reading.

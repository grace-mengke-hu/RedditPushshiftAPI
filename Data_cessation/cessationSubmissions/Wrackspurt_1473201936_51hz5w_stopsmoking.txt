Day 1 - fearful and reluctant

Today I will hit 24 hours smoke free. This is my second time actually trying to quit and I'm terrified. 
Last time, from October 2015 until Dec 30th, 2015, I actually wanted to quit. I was ready but my new year's celebrations were exceptionally stressful and anxiety inducing and I started again. 
I've tried switching to brands I don't like to help slow myself down, but ended up going right back to a pack a day of menthol Spirits (which are about $7 a pack here). 
 Two nights ago, my boyfriend told me he wanted me to live as long as possible, and I realized that I had completely fallen back into the habit/addiction. 
Now I'm almost 24 hours in but this time, it doesn't feel like I'm doing it for me, it feels like I'm doing it for him. 

I know smoking is terrible for me, and when I quit last year, I genuinely felt better, healthier, happier, and food was delicious! But now, I worry that my anxiety will prevent me from quitting successfully, and that if I don't succeed that my boyfriend will leave, which is both ridiculous and just makes me want to smoke more. 

Today is rough. I'm struggling. I am trying not to change any other part of my day to day, just remove cigarettes, maybe that's not the best way. 

Also, for the record, the boy is extremely supportive. He is a previous smoker who has quit successfully, and has helped a few of his closest friends and family quit also, I'm just not sure I'm ready... :-/

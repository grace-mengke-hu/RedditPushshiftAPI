THREE WEEKS, LIKE OMFGROFLHOLY****

SORRY, just had to get that out. I've quit many times, but dear **GOD** this one time has been tough. I've come *this* close to lighting one up several times, mostly due to incredible stress (found out I'm bipolar/started medication, taking five tough college courses, etc...) but thanks to a wonderful friend of mine who **refused** to give me a cigarette, despite all the times I've begged, and thanks to that one moment three weeks ago when I decided to splurge all my money on things so that I couldn't even buy a pack if I wanted, and thanks to taking new paths to class to avoid the smokers, I have somehow remained clean this long. I'm still having dreams about cigarettes, but hopefully that will pass. Also, running really helps! For some reason, feeling your lungs breathe in huge amounts of clean air and feeling your heart pump fast really gets me going to stay clean.

And of course, thanks to this wonderful sub. You guys rock! I feel like it's getting easier!

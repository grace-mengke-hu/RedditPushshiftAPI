1 week Fail

So I made it 7 days exactly before I had a moment of weakness/want.  I went out to eat with the wife and then we went for some drinks.  On the drive home I decided I was going to stop and buy a pack.  I smoked two cigarettes and then threw the pack away.  They tasted and smelled disgusting.  

I think part of the reason I did this was because I believed I didn't really want to quit, Ive only been smoking 4 years.  But after smoking those two It helped me realize that I do need to quit.  That it is really a stupid and pointless habit. 

I need to stop keeping track of how many hours/days/minutes it has been and just live my life not smoking.  So I have reset my badge and I think I will take a break from looking at this sub so much.  I found myself coming here to see if anyone else had failed so I could justify failing myself.  I have received plenty of encouragement here but I think it can sometimes be harmful for me.

I think my failure has taught me how important it is that I quit and I just don't need this crap in my life.

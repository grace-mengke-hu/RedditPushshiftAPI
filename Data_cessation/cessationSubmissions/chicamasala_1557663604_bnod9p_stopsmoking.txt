Taking champix and I stopped smoking 9 days ago. I feel so bad and it just won't quit.

I feel so low. Almost suicidal. I'm angry at my bf, everyone and everything. Will these feelings pass? Is this part of stopping and taking champix? Should I join some online group so I don't have to be such a bitch ?

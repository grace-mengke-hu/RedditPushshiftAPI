No, Hell No.

I ain't smoking another one after this last month. Not doin that again. 

 But, really, holy shit. I can't believe it's already been a month and that it's only been a month.. But I'm feelin good. Some days worse than others. Usually after a couple of beers. But it passes. And every fucking day is getting easier. 

My mantra "didn't need one yesterday, so I don't need one today. And tomorrow, we can talk about it."

Day 3 smoke free. Anyone else experiencing tantrums/immature behaviour in the first week?

I quit at 1am on the 22nd. First 15 hours were fine, then it sucked. Unfortunately for those around me I've been behaving like a toddler and have been very grumpy but yesterday I kept myself busy at the gym. When I got home I wanted to complain about everything eg. I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm achy, I'm anxious, I don't like this at all. Am I just being a dick or is this behaviour associated with nicotine withdrawal?

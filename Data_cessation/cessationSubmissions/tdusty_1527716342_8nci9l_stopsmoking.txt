I swallowed a foam ear plug :(

Seems like everyone’s having a crappy week :(
Feel free to laugh at me today 🤗

So I’ve been stuffing my pockets with sun flower seeds for a few days , can you see where this is going? (I’m a welder 👩‍🏭) so I keep ear plugs in my pocket I have to wear them in the shop . 

😪 I had a minute in between welding and grabbed a handful of seeds and threw them in my mouth . I felt the ear plug right away and panicked , well I swallowed it .... 

I didn’t smoke today tho  . Happy hump day friends

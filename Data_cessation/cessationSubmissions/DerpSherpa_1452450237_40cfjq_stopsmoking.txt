9 Months and 1 Week Today For Me But Hubby ...

I'm pretty sad today because despite my great milestone after smoking 38 years, I caught husband smoking for the second time and I said don't even bother to lie anymore just go ahead and do it but you can't do it around me and you can't do it in the house.  He's happy that he doesn't have to sneak around.   I'm really disappointed.  Now I have to pay an extra couple hundred dollars a month for insurance because of this. Okay, I'm disappointed AND mad. Thanks for letting me vent.

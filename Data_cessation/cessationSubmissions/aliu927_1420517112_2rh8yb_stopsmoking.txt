Smoke free for 48hrs!

hey /r/stopsmoking, I've been smoke free for 48hrs! The first two days were really intense and very hard. I've been a smoker for about almost 10 years and about a couple days ago I was on my last cigarette. I smoked it and from that point on I went cold turkey. After 48hrs I feel fantastic! I do get cravings here and there but those cravings doesn't last any longer than 5 minutes. I started to realize when I get cigarette cravings, and it's due to my usual routine. When there's nothing to do, after eating, going to work, right after I clock in or out, and getting ready to go home and of course hanging out with friends. I think about how badly I want to smoke, but it's all about self discipline. I DON'T need to smoke, its just my nicotine craving telling me I should smoke, but after I fight it, it feels awesome! I am going to continue on being smoke free and thanks to lurking around here for some time I finally mustard up the courage to simply just stop.

Update: I don't know about you guys, but I also noticed how much hungrier I've been. I mean I used to eat quite a bit even when I was smoking, but now I'm eating very frequently.

Update 2: Today is now 4/9/2015 and I feel better than ever. It was quite hard, went thru depression or was depressed for a couple of days. I feel better, I have more energy, and less tired. Its crazy now that when I drive in my car and someone is smoking a cigarette either 2 cars away or the car in front of me I can literally smell the cigarette smoke. Its crazy. Sorry for the super delayed update.  Cravings are still there from time to time my friends still smoke, but I can easily avoid and not want to smoke.

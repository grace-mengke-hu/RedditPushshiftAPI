Okay, I'm done.

I don't even know how to start.  I've smoked for way too long.  I've gone since last August on just cloves and the occasional cigarillo, but I can't keep that up, either.  


I already feel like my lungs are better for having quit regular cigarettes.  Now, I'm on to quitting the rest of it, too.

No more nicotine!

Wish me luck, I can already feel the urges creeping in.  That insidious little voice telling me that I need to go to the store.

Ignoring it for now, distracting myself with games &amp; Reddit.

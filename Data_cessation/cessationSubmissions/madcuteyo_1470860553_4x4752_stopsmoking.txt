Blood and urine test and advice

I never thought I would quit. But now I'm being forced to. I have to be smoke free 4 weeks before I go into surgery. I have the testing at the end of this month. I had my last cigarette last night. How long until it won't show up in my blood test and urine?

Also any advice on keeping the urges at bay? 
So far I've been timing myself. Like  right now I'm waiting till 6pm. Then from there 9pm and so forth for at least the next week I'll do this.

Not even a year off and I already bought a (small) convertible with the money I saved!

Alright to be fair I bought that toy a few month after quiting capitalizing on the money I was about to save as shown here: http://imgur.com/QZ8A7

And yes of course it's a small 12 years old car but I got plenty of fun with it!
Here's my 1999 Mazda Mx-5 scored for 1200 bucks to a guy from Serbia in Berlin, Germany. (Yes I checked it's not stolen)

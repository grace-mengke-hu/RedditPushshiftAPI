86 days in and here's what I notice

My heart rate:

It's regular and hardly ever jumps up to crazy uncontrollable speeds 

My circulation:

I used to be able to see the veins in my hands constrict to almost nothing. Now my fingers don't tingle, or get cold or feel numb.

My breath:

Still struggle sometimes. But when I take a flight of stairs, it doesn't take me minutes to recover. When I go for a long walk, there are no pauses. When I speak, no more pauses for long breaths

My anxiety:

Still there, but not about my health, and much better

My mind:

I never realized until today that I had actually quit...for good. No more going out in the cold to smoke, no more smelling like smoke, no more interrupting good conversations or running out after a good meal or wondering when this would stop or that would stop so I could smoke.

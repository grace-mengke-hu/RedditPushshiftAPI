What happens when you don't want to stop but you know you should?

I can admit it. I like smoking. It's the ONE thing I look forward to during the day. Nothing else can compare to the smoke: exhaling it, watching  it disperse, filling your lungs with that raggedy 'hssssss.' It's like having an emotional suppressant in a pack, in your pocket. It's quick, promising, and kind of futuristic in the way that it calms you in a minute. But I know that I shouldn't - it fucks with my mind. It fucks with my looks. It fucks with my family. Right now my entire room smells like cigarette smoke and I have no real way to hide it. I know my family will be home soon and whether or not they smell is will be up in the air but still the paranoia and thought of their disappointment and concern kills me. It's not their fault? But how do you stop when smoking is the one thing that sustains you throughout the day? I can't easily let go of that. But I want to.

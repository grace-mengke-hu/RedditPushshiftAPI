I'm out of smokes and Didn't buy any to keep me over..

Hi, I just found this forum.  I use /r/stopdrinking and thought, there's gotta be one for smoking.  Smoking for me was a daily thing, and I always made sure I had smokes to last me through the night.  Well, the last few days, I've tapered down a bit, like only 2 smokes a day.  Then I finished my pack last night 'round midnight and it's around 4pm the next day.  I'm just not smoking.  That's what I'm telling myself.

I'm wondering how many of you here vape or use other means of nicotine to ease the edge?  Whenever I tried to quit before and I used say a vape, I could smell the bad stuff in normal smokes and would tell myself "I want that."  

I was thinking about easing up a bit, then I got asked to go abalone diving, and I can't hold my breath worth a shit.  It just seemed to coincide with my internal desires for a higher quality of life that I seem to be depriving myself.  

At any rate, looking forward to getting to y'all and read more in this forum.  Thanks.

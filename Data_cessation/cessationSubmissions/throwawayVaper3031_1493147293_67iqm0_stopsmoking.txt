Feeling like vaping is destroying my life.

I'm using a throwaway since my girlfriend knows my username and I don't really want her to read this.

I used to smoke since I was around 15. I managed to quit for 3 years smoking and drinking and during that time did a lot of sports. Then I started to smoke again I tried to quit several times after that and it was really hard. One year ago I bought my first e-cig and for more than half a year know I completely moved to e-cigs from cigarettes.

Yet this wasn't the paradise which I expected. I'm sure there a ton of other reasons why I feel like my health is deteriorating yet I feel like vaping is a big part of it.

Basically I'm still addicted to nicotine, just in another form. But this isn't the only problem. I started having a lot of problems with my stomach and this spread to other functions of my body. I almost daily have stomach-aches and this gets in the way of traveling for too long. Even a short trip of several 4-5 hours to another country turned into a disaster since I got some sort of diarrhea. I'm quite ashamed of having to talk about this. I never know when my stomach will start to misbehave. It sometimes happens at parties and I just have to go home.

Basically I'm afraid to go to far from my house anymore. I feel that if I get back on track by stopping to ingest this glycerine from the e-liquid and start working out like I used to, I'll get my health back and even get my motivation (which is currently at a very low level).

I never wrote something like this and I probably write for myself, even though I would like some kind of advice or life lesson. I really just don't know. I feel like I'm fucking up really bad my life and at the moment just somehow manage to make it look ok from the outside.

If you read through here, thanks for your patience.

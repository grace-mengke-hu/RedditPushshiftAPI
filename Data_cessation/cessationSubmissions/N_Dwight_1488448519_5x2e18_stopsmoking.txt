Living with a partner who still smokes

My partner, who smokes, has been away working for 2 months.  She's coming back soon and I'm very nervous.  If, when she lights up, I love the smell... that's bad news as far as my quit is concerned.  On the other hand, if I hate it, which I'm pretty sure I will, how will that affect our relationship?

I know you can only stop for yourself, not for anyone else.  My plan is to be understanding, calm, and to lead by example.  In the short term I'm just worried about the smell I guess, and what my reaction will be.

Would like to hear people's experiences with situations like this.

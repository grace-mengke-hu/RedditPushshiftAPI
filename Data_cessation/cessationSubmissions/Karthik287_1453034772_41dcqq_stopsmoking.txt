When you have nothing to do

So its a long weekend. Survived an office party on Thursday and I've been doing really well until today. The cravings where close to zero before today. I work for a start up and was told we have a very stressful 3 months ahead of us. I'm very very very tempted to smoke because its been a terrible week and knowing its going to be as bad if not worse going forward,work wise, is messing with my head. I really want to start smoking again and can't seem to find the will power to say no. After 2 days of relaxing and not doing anything productive today I am struggling. I need help. Is it normal to have days like this 2 weeks after quitting?

Coping with pressure & stress

Hello all. Almost a week in now. Tried quitting before and the past couple of times I messed up because the pressure at work is so damn high. 

I'm starting to get there again & wanted to know how you all manage stress & what you do now to manage stress & pressure. I work in Sales & Marketing for a Start-Up so as you can expect the extremely frustrating moments tend to turn up a few times a week at the minimum. Usually I would go smoke a cigarette or two but now I don't know what to do. I feel like I need to do something to zone out and calm down but don't know what to do. Looking for suggestions.

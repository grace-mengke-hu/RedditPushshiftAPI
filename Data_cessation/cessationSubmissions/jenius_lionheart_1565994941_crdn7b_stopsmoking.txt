Struggling

After countless attempts, I smoked what I wanted to be my last cig a half hour ago. My kids are playing, husband at work for another two hours. Boredom is my trigger - I always want more, more, more. Cooking? Watch me drink a bottle and have a smoke with each glass. That's me. I have to stop. I'll be 40 this year. I have quit for brief stretches and I know the joy that quitters feel. I'm tired of being a slave, waking up each morning planning when I can sneak a smoke.

I'm going to take a shower and pray to God right now that I don't use our need for paper towels as a reason to go to the store and get more.

This has to be it for me. My kids deserve better. I deserve better.

Argh. Feeling like smoking coz sometimes reality of life hits you and the unfortunate part money plays in it, it's like ah who cares might as well smoke to survive this life. NO

That may be the funny part of it. If I smoke and further my illness, there is a cost for it. So dark so sad. This fucking life. It's great as long as money is not required. As long as I can distract myself from thinking of money. 

I'm just a dark person. Don't mind. Please tell me if this post needs to be deleted. Cheers. 

For sure money buys no happiness. Maybe loneliness. But it surely buys a good holiday :D let's work for that!!!

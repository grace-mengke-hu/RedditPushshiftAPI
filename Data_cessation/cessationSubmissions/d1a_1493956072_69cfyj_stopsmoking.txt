Daily smoker for 4 years, quit cold turkey

Hello everyone, I'm only 20 years old but have been smoking ~10 cigarettes per day for the past 4 years. I'm about 2 weeks in right now, I've smoked 2 in that period and was instantly disgusted by them and myself. 

The first thing I noticed is that the cravings that I'm getting are nothing compared to the cravings some of you are referring to. I tend to be impulsive and my self-control is not my most refined trait, but the cravings are not anything like I expected them to be. Sure, I think about smoking at least 500 times per day, but it's not that hard a thought to deter from. When is the absolute peak for cravings as far as intensity goes? I don't think the two cigarettes that I half-assedly smoked subsided the cravings in any manner that could be considered significant, since there was no immediate relief from withdrawal symptoms.

Also, another thought. I noticed that a lot of you are quitting cold turkey and not able to handle it, or suffering terribly while doing so. I see no reason why you would ever go through that unless you're having as easy a time quitting as I am. Ween yourself off of them, if you smoke 20 now go for 15, if it's still too hard go for 17, 18, 19 - at some point the difference between the amounts of the active nicotine in your organism will be so insignificant that the symptom increase will be so miniscule you won't notice it even if you tried to.

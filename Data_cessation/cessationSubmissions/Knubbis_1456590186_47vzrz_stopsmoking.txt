Tomorrow is they day I kick the habit

This months expenses left me with about 10 euro, and I haven't even bought any food yet. So I'm going to do the only responsible thing I've done in 2 years time and quit smoking. I've always thought It would be easier if I had money to spend on snacks to distract me as I fight the cravings, but I've tried that and instead of buying something to eat it's really easy to instinctively buy a pack. I've got 2 cigarettes left right now, and I'm going to (not) enjoy them tonight.

Smoking has been the biggest source of my anxiety and depression the past years, I'm certain of it. And I really don't feel motivated to do much of anything nowadays, so this is gonna take some crazy amount of willpower, but I feel if I can manage to get past my smoking-habits, I can finally start doing the stuff I'm supposed to do, like studying and investing in new hobbies.

This is probably the only post I'll be making in this subreddit. Just wanted to announce that there'll soon be another quitter lurking somewhere, fighting his own body and mind.

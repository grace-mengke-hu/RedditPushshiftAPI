24 hours

I just hit the 24 hour threshold. I previously went 10 years without smoking, and 3 years ago I started back up. Over the past 3 years I've tried to quit multiple times. I finally did the math on how much money and time I spend, and I'm done. Each time I've tried, I always set certain time goals to make. Instead, I'm no longer doing that. I'm just going to focus on making it through each day. And to everyone else on this road with me, good luck.

Let's try again.

I've just passed my first smoke anniversary, what an achievement... so what better time than to try and quit. This is my third or fourth attempt and I'm going to try it without medication or other helpers because last time I got addicted to nicotine pills instead and that's not really an improvement in my eyes. Wish me luck!

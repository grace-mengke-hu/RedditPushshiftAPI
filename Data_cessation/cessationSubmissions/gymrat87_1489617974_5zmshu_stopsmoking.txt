My friend passed away

My friend passed away unexpectedly last Wednesday.  This week has been the hardest week of my life.  Just wanted to tell you guys even though I'm going through hard times, I didn't start smoking again.  I thought about it like 5 million times ... honestly what got me through it is looking at the non-smokers and seeing that it's possible to get through difficult times without nicotine.   

Edit***
Thank you for all the kind words.  I truly appreciate it.

Does interval smoking work?

DISCLAIMER: I do not want to encourage anyone to try what I do right now! I mainly do this for science :D

Hey! I've been smoking since 2 years now and I already wanted to stop after one year. But I almost always relapsed within 2 weeks. I was able to quit for the last 2 months but I was stupid enough to buy a pack again. I set myself the limit of one cigarette per day at max. And then I got a idea. What if I train myself to be able to stop smoking at will, by becoming used to quitting. I know that sounds stupid and really hard to achieve but let me explain:

Every person I know that stopped smoking is afraid of it because they think that they will relapse immediately, which is true in most cases (experienced it too often myself). But what if you have a bad breakup, get fired or some close relative dies? Many ex-smokers would grab a pack because they hope for some stress release or because they loose self control. Or just think about the infamous drunk relapse, that got many people back in their old habit. 

So wouldn't it be beneficial to learn controlling the addiction and actually be able to smoke every now and then if you want to and not get sucked back into the one pack a day habit?

I really don't know if this is possible or if anyone tried it before and that's why I'm asking here. 

Did anyone you try it?

Do you know somebody that did?

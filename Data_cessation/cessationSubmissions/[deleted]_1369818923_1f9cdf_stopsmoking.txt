Day One with E-Cigs

Hola everyone, I'm new here. During the past year I've been trying to quit smoking. I've read Allen Carr's book and I've managed to not touch a single cigarette for two weeks. I've quit using patches, gums, cold turkey, switching to pipe smoking, herbal cigarettes with no nicotine.

Pretty much everything. But after two weeks of being without nicotine, my mind tells me "Hey yo! You don't have any cravings or withdrawals do you? This means you can have a cheeky cigarette every now and then! Buy a pack now and put it in your closer so you can smoke every once in a while".

Yeah right. That pack lasts for a day and then I'm back to hardcore smoking. Which is why today I've purchased an e-cig. In two weeks if I feel like smoking a cigarette I'm just going to get a few puffs of vaporized nicotine.

Healthy? No. Healtier than cigs? Yeah. Addictive? Obviously. Nicotine? Yeah, it contains that. 

Oh well. I feel like this is the right way to quit for me.

I have to stop smoking

This morning, I had a phonecall from the doc saying that my lung function results suggest I have COPD. I'm 33, smoked since I was 12. I am a heavy smoker, especially when I have a drink. I HAVE to stop smoking, no two ways about it but the very thought has me setting myself up to fail. What's done is irreparable so I can only prevent further damage and try to live a little longer. My husband gave up three weeks ago using e-cigs but he has far more willpower than me. 

Anybody been in a similar situation?

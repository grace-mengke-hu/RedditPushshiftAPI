Have you been coughing mucus and blood after that?

I've got flu 3wks ago. I've been coughing in the mornings very hard and i saw a small piece of blood. I've got very scared and quit smoking. I'm 21 and i've been smoking for about 7 years. I still get small amounts of blood in the mornings sometimes. (With weird mucus, brown and etc) Anybody have ever encountered with this??

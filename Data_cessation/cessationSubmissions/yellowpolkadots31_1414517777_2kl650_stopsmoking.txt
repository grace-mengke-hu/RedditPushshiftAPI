Tips on drinking without the smoking.

I just hit my 11 day mark 30 mins ago (woot woot). I started off 11 days ago with the electronic cigerette approach, now I'm onto chewing gum, (not the nicotine kind, just regular old gum) trying to ween off nicotine completely. I'm going out tonight with my boyfriend for his weekly comedy show, it's at a bar of course, I usually have my one rum and coke to relax me (social anxiety disorder) practically everyone there including my bf smoke. Any tips or tricks or general mantras I should repeat to myself so I don't give in, even to the electronic cig?

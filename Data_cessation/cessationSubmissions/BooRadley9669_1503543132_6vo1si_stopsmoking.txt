I'm finally ready.

I've posted here before a couple of months ago about trying to quit. It didn't go so well and I gave up. But I'm ready now. 

Honestly, I'm just tired of this shit.  It's not even fulfilling anymore. I'm seeing how much money I'm wasting. I'm tired of paying to kill myself. Life sucks sometimes but it's not that bad to pay myself to do it, you know? But most of all, I'm tired of letting my mind win. My mind and these cigarettes have been controlling me for almost 7 years. Almost a pack a day. 

I just bought Carr's audiobook and downloaded a tracking app. I'm getting sunflower seeds in the morning. I have to make a mini road trip so I'll be listening the whole way there. Any other suggestion are welcome. You'll be seeing me here now. I want to be a non smoker again.

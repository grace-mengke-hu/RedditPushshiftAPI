Tips for not smoking in the morning.

I’ve been trying to quit in earnest for the for the past 3 days but it’s like I don’t even think about it in the morning.  The past 2 days I’ve smoked twice each day, in the morning and at night and those seem to be the hardest time to not smoke. Looking for some pointers from people who had the same struggle.

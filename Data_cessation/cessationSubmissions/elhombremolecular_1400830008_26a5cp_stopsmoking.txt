Relapsed after 50 days, surprisingly not upset.

I quit cold turkey the first time around, and I went for 52 days. I had a bit too much to drink on Wednesday, and I broke down and smoked a total of 3 cigs over a few hours. 

After smoking them, instead of overwhelming guilt, I just thought to myself...."That's it?" 

"That's what I was doing? I haven't been missing anything by not smoking".

I reset my badge and I have dedicated myself to not smoking again. I guess after being smoke free for almost 2 months, I gave myself time to realize that I don't need smoking/cigarettes in my life. 

Just a badge reset/relapse post. But I have a new point of view/enthusiasm. The support around here is great. Carry on.

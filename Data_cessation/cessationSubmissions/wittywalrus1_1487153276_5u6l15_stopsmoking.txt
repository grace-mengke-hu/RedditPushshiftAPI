day ONE and I am tripping balls :D

hello,
first day trying to quit, after twenty years of smoking a pack a day.

I tried a couple of times before but never made past 24 hours, never.
probably never been without smoking for this long, and it fucking bites, seems like tripping...
I started reading allen carr book today as well, I hope it helps.

Please critique my plan to quit.

I've had cancer twice in my early to mid twenties due to smoking and arthritis drugs. I just got checked last month and I'm cancer free for three years now. After the good news, I have decided to get healthy. 

I've been struggling with alcohol for some time now. I am in my third week of sobriety and I still rely on cigs as a crutch for drinking. My next major goal is to quit smoking. Here is my plan:

I am setting a date of March 31st. I am hoping that this date is realistic as I know trying to deal with multiple addictions usually results in failure. If this doesn't sound realistic, let me know. I want a hard date and not a "let's see how you feel" mindset.

From now on, there will be no smoking inside my place or my car. I will not smoke in anyone elses car. It's very cold right now. Smoking outside will be uncomfortable and will reduce the amount I smoke.

I have a roommate that smokes. I will be trying very hard to get him to join me. He will be joining me outside regardless.

I haven't had much luck with non smoking aids (gum/patch). My parents did very well with chantix but the depression side effects are pretty scary for me. Cold turkey has been the most successful for me. I have used tooth picks or sunflower seeds for the hand/mouth infatuation. 

I have also started exercising again. It has been tough; however, since my rebounding immune system has sent my arthritis into a mild flair up. I am trying to avoid going back onto my medication; however, I will if it stops me from exercising.

Thank you for reading and please let me know if you have any suggestions or critiques.

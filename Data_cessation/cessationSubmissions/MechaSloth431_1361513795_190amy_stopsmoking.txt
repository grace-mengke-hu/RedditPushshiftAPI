Just a 100 day check-in

So after I quit smoking I started getting very motivated but I also got laid off and I'm having a hard time finding work still. But I decided at the last minute to go back to school. I took one semester back in 2008 and this was right when smoking quit being what I did when the people I was hanging out with smoked. It was something I started doing on my drive to school alone, and before and after class. This time in my life was good, I hadn't spent a fortune on cigs and my health wasn't in bad shape yet.

Well now I'm back in the same campus as a non smoker. I thought it would be hard to go back and walk through the same areas and remember when things were good (and I was a smoker). Here's the part where I feel like a winner: The campus went smoke free.

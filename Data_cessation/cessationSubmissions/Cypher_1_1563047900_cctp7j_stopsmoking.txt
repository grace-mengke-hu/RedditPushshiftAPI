How do you deal with the craving?

Title. I'd like to know what did you guys do (or are doing) to deal with craving. I'd love to stop smoking and I can easily go a week without smoking but I feel like the craving eventually catches up and I end up smoking again. I wanna get rid of this really bad habit but I basically don't really know how to start. I can search all I want on the internet but, in that regard, I feel like experience is really valuable, so that's why I'm here. Do you guys have any tips and tricks on how to stop smoking? Have you guys tried any of the "stop smoking" things that sells in pharmacies? Thank you so much for your time and imput!

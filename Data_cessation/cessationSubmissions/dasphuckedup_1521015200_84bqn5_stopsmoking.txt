Today is the day

I’ve been struggling for about a week with the decision. Flipping from thinking about my deteriorating health and yellowing nails and bad breath to thinking about how I would handle the stress at work and what I would even do when I’m bored or lonely anymore and then back again. But I’ve made the decision to quit my habit tonight, and I wanted to post this here. I feel like telling you, random strangers on the internet, might help hold me accountable and maybe it’ll really help me to actually quit. 

Here’s to being a quitter, and for a good reason this time.

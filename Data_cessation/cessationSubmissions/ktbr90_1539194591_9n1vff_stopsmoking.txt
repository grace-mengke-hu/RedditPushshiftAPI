So, as the title says I am exactly 3 days past my last cig, and I visited my parents, as I had a little business in a nearby town. So I'm here, talking, me and my dad made a stunning dinner, had 2-3 glasses of wine, and I'm sleeping here. So my mom smokes, but I got her Carr's Easy Way, and I'm here in my old room, sort of fighting a carving, and inhaling through a strow.

All of a sudden I imagine myself As the POV of a stranger. How ridiculous could I look like? And then something hit home.

You know what would be even more ridiculous? If I even paid for it. And IT made me stink and sick. Which is eventually smoking.

Be safe there! Wishing you all the best!

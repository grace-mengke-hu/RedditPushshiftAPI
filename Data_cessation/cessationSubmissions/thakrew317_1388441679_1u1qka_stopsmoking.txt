I feel so much better without tobacco!

It hasn't been long but may be going on 3-4 months smoke and dip free and I gotta say I feel so much better and been working out for a month...not only have I weighed 145lbs for the past 15 years but as soon as I quit and started working out I'm up to 160! Score one for me..and congrats to everyone else in here with time under there belt...how did you guys quit and how hard was it for you and how many packs did you smoke a day....I quit with chantix for 2 months and had to quit taking it cause of how sick it would make me even if ate on it but luckily I havnt had any cravings yet from being off it for a month :) or any desire to smoke or dip

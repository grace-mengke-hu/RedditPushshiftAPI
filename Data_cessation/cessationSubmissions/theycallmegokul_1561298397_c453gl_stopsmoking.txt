I have a lot of mental disorders and I dont think I can do it

I used to take Bupropion until two years back which is mostly an anti depressant but also used as a smoking cessation med for some people, which really helped me. I had to change therapists due to a change in medication and I was on Olanzapine (had to stop Bup because the doc said I also was at risk for epilepsy for some reason) but that shit made me feel numb as fuck and put on a lot of weight and my dick wouldnt work and I used to go insane when drinking and now I'm off the meds and in a shit place and I'm going nuts and the only way I can get it out of my system is by writing weird troll posts and I cant even fucking stop quitting this smoking shit

Drunk cravings

Hey all, I'm sorry I post so much. And comment so much.

But I'm drunk. (Obviously, probably.)

But, anyways, when I drinkk, the craving is worse. All I want is a cigarette. It will top the night off per-fect-leeeeee. 

The cravings seem exacerbated when I'm drunk. WHY?! And how do I get past it? I don't want to quit drinking alcohol or smoking weed, but I like to smoke cigs when either high or drunk. Someone either explain why or tell me how they control it -- PLEEEAESE!

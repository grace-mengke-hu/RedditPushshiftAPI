Day 17/18

Everything is going great! I never got cravings until I hit 2 weeks, though. How annoying is that? The physical addiction is definitely gone, but my brain keeps telling me "hey, it's a great time to go have a smoke!". It doesn't help that the weather is totally awesome this week and I just want to sit outside... I guess I really need to find something to do besides smoke, haha... I have a gym membership but my gym is on the other side of town and I don't know what I'm doing.


So, I think I'm going ok. I feel better, have more energy, sleep better, eat worse(working on that too), I've only gained 5 lbs., my body doesn't ache as much, I breathe better... I *do not* **ever** want to smoke again. This is all so worth it! I'm gonna go have a beer to celebrate :)

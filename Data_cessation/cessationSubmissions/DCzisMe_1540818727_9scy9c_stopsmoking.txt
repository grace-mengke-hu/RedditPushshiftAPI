Day 1: Feels like I've been here before.

So 56 days ago I had my last drink. Getting sober has been the best thing I've ever done. I had quit smoking for a year about 2 years ago, and at the time it was the best thing I had done, but after a year of heavy smoking I was starting to feel that lung burn again. That cough was getting worse. So, here we are. Day 1, almost 24 hrs since my last puff. Using the patch to curb cravings and ready to do as many pushups, squats and sit ups as I have to when the cravings arise. This time I'm  ready. I'm eating healthy, not drinking which is huge, and frankly I'm tired. Tired of the wasted money, tired of feeling tired, of the cough, the stigma, the smell. This time is different even though it feels similar. This time, I quit for good. 

Looking forward to interacting with all of you fine people as we embark on this journey together. Can't wait to get some fresh air in these lungs again. Life is good people! Breathe free!

$89,425 spent on Cigs. Is $ a good motivator?

I'm preparing to quit. So I was curious to know how much I've actually spent on cigarettes. It isn't perfectly accurate but it is close enough. Not sure It will help motivate me either? Just posting to see if others have used this sort of tactic to help them quit?

Heck, if I'd invested the money instead all this time and got a measly 5% return I'd be somewhere in the neighborhood of $100k+

I can't imagine a life without smoking. I am totally defeated. Just now I quit for good.

My mother chainsmoked throughout all her pregnancies. I was an addict from day one.

I somehow made it to 26 years before I started to smoke myself. I landed on some very bad times. I lost the love of my life. I was hospitalized for psychosis 6 times. I worked 14 hour night shifts in a place I absolutely hated. I failed university for the fifth and last time. It felt like my soul was sucked right out. Just living as an empty shell. That is when I started smoking. I was instantly hooked and didn't care, because nothing really mattered. Started drinking beer daily. Atleast I had some small shred of pleasure when there was nothing else.

I managed to put my life back on track. Moved back to my hometown that I love. Got a job that I actually like doing and only do the normal 40 hour work week during daytime. Everything is looking bright now. Soon I will be moving to my own apartment away from roommates. Next year I will have my first ever paid summer vacation. I managed to quit drinking beer a few days ago. That was easy.

I have now been smoking for 2,5 years. It has not yet ruined my health completely. Now would be an ideal time to quit. The problem I have is that I cannot even imagine a life without smoking anymore. I smoke a cigarette the very first thing in the morning when I wake up. I don't even put on clothes first. Then I make a cup of coffee and smoke a second cigarette. I head off to work and fire up one more. I arrive at work 10 minutes before it starts, so time for a cigarette ofcourse. All the time that I am working I count minutes until the next mandatory break starts so I can smoke two more cigarettes. After every meal I smoke. When I used to drink I also chainsmoked. You get the point, smoking has become so ingrained in my habits I can't imagine a life without smoking. The sad part is that I look forward to every smoke. It is what gets me out of bed each morning.

During the last two and a half years when times got better I have tried to quit many times. Usually with nicotine chewing gum. I have never made it to two days. Each time I try to quit it feels harder than before. I think about smoking all the time. After one day of not smoking I dream about smoking when I sleep. After those dreams it is so fucking hard not to light another cigarette.

Well today is the day I quit for good. Not a single puff ever again. I can't imagine a life without smoking, so I just have to somehow do it. Other people have done it too so why can't I? I made this post as a way of making quitting official.

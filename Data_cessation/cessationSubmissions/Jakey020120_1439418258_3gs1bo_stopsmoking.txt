The build up to stopping?

Hey Y'all,

I'm kind of new here (this being my first post and all(props to whoever pops my comment cherry)) and this kind of thing has probably been posted before...but after almost 10 years of smoking and my 24th Birthday looming I'm about to quit smoking on Saturday due to unexpected onset of some crazy ass breathing issues.

Trouble is, I've not even started yet and my brain is already talking me out of it "Smoking is good, my breathing will be fine, what if someone annoys you" and I know it's not true, but I kind of feel like Gollum/Smeagol right now. Anyone know of a way to battle these thoughts?

I know its going to be way worse on Saturday to the point where I last only an hour.

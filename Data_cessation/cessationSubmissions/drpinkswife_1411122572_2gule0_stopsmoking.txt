Damn Brain!

So I knew it was today. Been looking forward to Star 3 for a couple of days. So of course I dreamt of smoking last night. 

The difference was, I didn't feel guilty about it and now that I've realised that, it makes me wary. Before my smoking dreams always involved guilt! Grrr.

And today, instead of making my Star3 cake, I'm going to visit a friend whose life went tits up in the past month. And I can tell she's smoking. So I want to be really supportive (her baby's father walked out), but I feel like, fuck I don't want to be around the smoke. But I've written it here and I'm going to be fine! Right?!

Happy fucking Star3 to me! 

Not how I expected to [feel](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/4OVLKQc.gif) today.

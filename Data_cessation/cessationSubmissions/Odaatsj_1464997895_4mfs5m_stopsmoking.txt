100 Days Today

Feels good, but my addict mind wants to reward myself for getting 100 days...with a cigarette!  Crazy.

I realize I am blessed to be where I am now compared to how hard it was when I initially quit... very few cravings. I go through most of a day without even thinking about it.  Dealing with this is much easier than trying to quit again.  Although there are only a couple of cravings per day now, I need to be on guard... There will likely be periodic bad days or bad cravings.  

Cravings are temporary, each individual one, and cravings overall.  Each time I get through a craving without smoking, I weaken them, and my addiction.  Eventually the addiction will starve and I will have no cravings.  If I smoke, the addiction and my cravings go back to full strength.   Keep the gift you have now. Remember this when you get a spike in cravings.

So I'm quitting smoking but twice today I've given in due to the extreme dizziness I am experiencing. I also have hypoglycemia. What can I do?

So I know having a support system is usually good for this, but I only have a few close friends here. My boyfriend is quitting with me, but for him it's no big deal. He doesn't experience withdraws and is a hell of a lot stronger about a decision like this that I am.
I've quit before and used Chantix. This time I can't really afford it but I just wanna be healthier. How can I get through this easier?

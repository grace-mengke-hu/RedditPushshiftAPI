13 Hours and 52 mins so far!

After smoking for 7 years, last night I decided to stop. I threw away everything, it was a sad goodbye but it had to be done. 

So what I need is some advice and tips to keep me going, the main reason I decided to give up was due to the cost (Â£9.15 per day), I don't like people smelling it on me as I don't find it to be very professional and the worst one is that I'm only 21 and it had aged my face quite a bit.

The problem is that I LOVE smoking, there is nothing I love more than coming home at the end of the day sitting and smoking until I can smoke no more.

HELP!

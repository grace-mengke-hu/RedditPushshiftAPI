My advice for people who want to quit, especially gamers, this is what worked for me.

I read Allen Carr's book and it really didn't stick with me until I hit chapter 34 and applied my own spin to things.  Smoking isn't, nor was it ever, enjoyable.  Up here in Canada during the winter I'd go out and have a smoke and I would freeze my ass off.  It totally sucked, why was I doing this? it didn't make sense.  I realized that it wasn't myself that wanted the cigarette since I could see the visible effects it was having on my body and what have you but rather this demon of a monster inside of me.  Like a monster/boss in a videogame that requires a certain pattern to defeat.  The only pattern to defeat this difficult boss is starving it.  so that's what I did.  I treated my smoking as an enemy in a videogame that could only be defeated one way.  When I did defeat the boss then I would unlock the achievement of being a non-smoker.  

Essentially I applied quitting smoking to one of the things I enjoy to do, which is playing videogames.  I put a personal spin on it and it actually made the process easier.  I hate losing and if I took another puff then that would be a loss to me.  A loss that I don't want to start over with.  Financials came into play too when I realized that the $70-$80 a week i spent on cigarettes could be used to buying another game to play.  Something I would get way more value from.  

At the end of the day I believe the best way to quit is to A. realize it's not you that wants a smoke but something else living inside of you and B. to defeat it utilizing something that you enjoy and putting that spin on it.  just my 2 cents.

I’m trying to quit again

I tried quitting smoking  over a year ago , now I’m trying to quit again. I work and when I’m busy I don’t want a cigarette, stresses in life which we all have  make me want a cigarette, I really want to not smoke anymore.  I also have high anxiety, I’m getting enrolled in a quit smoking program. I want to be successful in quitting   Any ideas that could help me ?

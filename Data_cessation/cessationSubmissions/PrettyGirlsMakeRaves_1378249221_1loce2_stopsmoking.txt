Why is it you never see anyone struggling to quit smoking on TV and in movies?

There was a storyline on Friends when Chandler started up again and then quit, but I'm wracking my brain and it's the only instance I can think of. 

All of us on here know that it can be a huge physical and psychological hurdle to overcome, and a life-changing experience when you do. We also know how many people suffer illness and die as a result of smoking. So how come, when every conceivable human experience has been documented on screen at one time or another, you never see anyone dealing with the gargantuan task of quitting?
I suppose the quiet self-loathing of the smoker or the almost imperceptible little triumphs of the ex-smoker aren't as glamourous as a good junkie story, but I would love to see it. Maybe get some kind of pathetic validation that my own battle was worthy and mattered.

Can anyone think of instances in the media when they've seen a positive, or at least realistic account of someone stopping smoking?

EDIT: Actually any recommendations of books (fiction) that deal with the subject would be cool, written word seems more suited to conveying the whole internal struggle aspect.

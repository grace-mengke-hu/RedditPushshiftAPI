Hello all, new around here

I've just subscribed to r/stop drinking due to worries it flares up depression/rage and is a bad decision for me.(no physical addiction but I drink almost every weekend... Probably abnormal)

I know smoking is and I've been doing so heavily due to the afformentioned stresses.

I maybe smoke a half pack to a full every other day

I hope to also help others here fight to regain control.

P.s- are vape pens a "no" around here? I was given a mod and liquid that I thought would help me to quit. I do intend to use it unless that's inadvisable.

It really does get easy and normal (2 months)

1-2 pack a day smoker, about 20 years. 

I would never have believed it, but quitting gets easier and easier the farther along you are. SHOCKINGLY SO. 

I had some erroneous thoughts at the beginning. I thought that the gnawing, crazy, brain screaming out for nicotine monster would never go away. I thought smoking was my identity, a piece of me that I didn't really want to lose. I thought I'd be mourning the loss for the rest of my life. 

That was all lies. 

I'm no one special. Hell, I didn't even want to quit. I did it because I couldn't afford it anymore. I grieved, I moaned, I felt sorry for myself, I raged, I suffered. But not for long. After some practice, my brain changed and didn't want it anymore. It's hard to believe if you're a new quitter. Trust me, I was you. 

Now I don't want to smoke. I don't sit around and miss it and long for it. 

At worst, my brain does a trick *maybe* once or twice a week and whispers "cigarette?" and I laugh because that's dumb and it goes away in a minute and life goes on. 

If you're like me, you might wonder what the "old-timers" are doing on a quit smoking sub. "Is it really that hard that they need 24-7 support for years?!!!" No, most of us are just popping in to support you. 

You can do it. 

Maybe it's hard right now. Maybe it's easy. Maybe it's the hardest, worst thing ever right now! But guess what? If you continue, you will be fine. Your brain will re-wire and life will be just as normal as ever after a while.

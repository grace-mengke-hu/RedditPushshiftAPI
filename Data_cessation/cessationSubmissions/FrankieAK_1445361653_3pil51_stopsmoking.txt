How can I help motivate my husband to quit?

He has been trying for over two years to quit since I've gotten pregnant. He tried chantix once and he actually stopped, but started again. 

He refuses to take it again because he didn't like it even though it only took a week of him taking it. 

Now, I've just lost my job and we are trying to plan a cross country move and we just absolutely cannot afford for him to smoke. 

I know it's hard. I quit smoking before I got pregnant. But, every time I bring it up he gets defensive. But I have to feed my child before I feed his habit. 

How can I nicely bring it up and encourage and help him quit?

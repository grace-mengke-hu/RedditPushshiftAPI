Can someone in the UK help me find a good rechargeable E-cig/Vapouriser with nicotine liquids on eBay at a good price as Im just over whelmed be it all. Thank you in advance

So like the title says. Looking for anyone who has had a good experience with buying  off of eBay. Could you point me to where you bought them from (the seller) and also a liquid with nicotine of which Im hoping to taper off. Last question if you dont mind, Im a heavy smoker of baccy (because of cost) My question is how much would it cost to transfer to e-cigs per week/month ? Many thanks :)

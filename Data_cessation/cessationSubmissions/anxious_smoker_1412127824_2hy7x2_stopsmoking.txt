Around 10 days quit, wondering if this anxiety is excessive.

I'd gone two to three week periods of not smoking before (though I wasn't planning on quitting, just couldn't smoke due to illness) and had been completely without withdrawl symptoms, but when I went three days without smoking recently I started having panic attacks and was anxious all the time, feeling like I was going crazy and would wind up in a mental hospital. This convinced me to quit since I didn't like having my mental health subject to something out of my control.

A week later, and I haven't had any more panic attacks, but I often feel like I'm on the edge of losing control and developing schizophrenia, which I figure is still a symptom of the anxiety from quitting. 

Surprisingly enough, I don't really get any cravings, but the fear that my smoking was self-medicating something rather than exacerbating it is weighing me down all the time. Has anyone else had an experience like this? How long did it take you to not ever worry if you were in control again?

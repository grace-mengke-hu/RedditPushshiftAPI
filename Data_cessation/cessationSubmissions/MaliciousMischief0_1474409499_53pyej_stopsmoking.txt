Resisting smoking while drinking?

Drinking is a big trigger for me, but I'd rather not stop drinking entirely; I enjoy going to the bar with my friends for a few pints from time to time. I had quit smoking for about four months at one point, and it was fairly difficult to resist smoking while drinking. It was eventually how I broke my streak and started smoking again. Anybody have any experience with this or have any tips for staying strong while having a few drinks?

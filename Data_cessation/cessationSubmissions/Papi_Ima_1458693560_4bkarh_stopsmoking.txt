Have to quit. Setting quitting date.

OK there are reasons why I have to do it now.  I'm moving in with friends out of state and have to look for a job once I get there.  My friend's are putting me up as their guest and will be helping me financially when I arrive, so my incentive to find a job is high because this will get me out of my current living situation, which is abusive.

They are life partners with two children.  This is a sacrifice being made for me.  I've dealt with chronic unemployment since getting PTSD for about 10 years and it's time to break this cycle.

I think love will help, a lot, and it will help that my friend is literally willing to sit at a table with me and help me look for a job.  She's already helped me with a resume , cover letters and other things already.

Our friendship is a long story and has been going on for a long time.  

Her partner has COPD and she has two small children and is a non-smoker.  She thinks I'm quit already.  I was for about a month but I've been smoking again for a while now.  Right now I'm under a lot of stress.  I move in late June.  I ordered the free patch, I got it, and I have to decide, when, not if, to use it.

Going cold turkey on anything during a transition for me is out of the question. Stressors having to do with current emotionally abusive environment are high right now, and I had very low moments today caused by job search stressors associated with job search.  None of that changes the fact that I have to quit. 

And it's the single best thing I can do for my health right now.  

I want to quit June 11th with the patch.

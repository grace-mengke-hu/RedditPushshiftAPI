going out tonight. how do i prevent my drunk-self from giving into the “maybe just one” lie?

So I haven’t gone out to full on party since I quit smoking nearly a month ago. Knowing how well I enjoyed smoking on such nights, I’m concerned that I could potentially give in and say “fuck it one smoke won’t hurt”. 

I’m sure a lot of you have been here, any advice?

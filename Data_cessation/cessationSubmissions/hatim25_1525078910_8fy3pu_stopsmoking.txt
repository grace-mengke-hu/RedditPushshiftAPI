15 hours in

I'm turning 26 in 3 weeks and I want it to be a smoke\-free birthday. 

I've been smoking at least a pack/day for the last 10 years, and I could smoke more than 2 packs in a single night out once or twice a week. I never really enjoyed smoking and always felt like shit doing it. Still feel like shit right now.

I attempted to quit a dozen times before but always relapsed at some point, usually after a few days only \- except one time I kept my self smoke\-free for 3 months. It was 4 years ago...

I smoked my last cigarette yesterday at 7pm and I'm 15 hours in as I'm typing this. 

Wish me luck folks! ❤️

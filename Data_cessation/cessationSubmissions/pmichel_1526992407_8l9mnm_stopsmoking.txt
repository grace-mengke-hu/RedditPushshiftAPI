Prepare for Battle

I"m not really craving much, haven't since I quit but last weekend I was hit with stress and Saturday was pretty much a nonstop crave. I ate ice cream and distracted myself with tv but it occurred to me this morning I have to plan and be ready. Catastrophic stress will come, no doubt about it, things happen, and if my go to is still, me chainsmoking, I will be right back there again.  I must find another way to handle things.  So, say the worst possible thing happens, how will smoking help?  Will it calm me down?  No it won't.  Will smoking energize me?  no of course not. It will not do a damn thing but turn me into an instant addict again.  Must plan ahead and come up with a strategy to cope.

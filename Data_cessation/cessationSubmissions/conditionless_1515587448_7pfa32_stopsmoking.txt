3 weeks!

This week has been the easiest since I quit smoking. The first week sucked, the second week there were still some cravings. I had a notification from my quit smoking telling me today was my third week and that made me realize that I didn’t think of smoking all day yesterday! Yay!
I quit drinking 6 months ago and have tried to quit smoking but I just could not. I kept starting over every time I got stressed or irritated or bored or any feelings actually. Smoking is a terrible smelly habit and I am so glad to be done with it! I had so much shame and guilt from that habit and it made me feel weak...like I couldn’t accomplish my goals if I couldn’t even stop myself from smoking. 
Anyways, thank you all who shared your struggles and triumphs. My smoke free app and this Reddit group are the reasons I was able to quit and remain smoke free for three weeks! Whenever I struggled, I came and read here. I also watched my smoke free app as I saw my health improve within few days.
Thank you!

Cold Turkey From Now - Day 1

So the past 2 days I've been gradually reducing my intake of nicotine (except the 3rd where I felt like garbage and basically smoked 10 cigs +) .. and I've tried vape, gum, but it just feeds the addiction in another form. 
Nicotine, in all forms, is a deadly, mind consuming and health ruining drug.
The only way to properly quit is cold turkey... one cigarette always hurts and leads to more cigarettes. It's just not worth it, and never was. So many problems have come in my life from stupid cigarettes. It's just pathetic how we tell ourselves were gonna quit and years later, we didn't, and had lied to ourselves the whole time. And the time goes by fast, anyway. 
So, I've been reducing for 3 days, and now it's time to never light up or have another hit of nicotine in any form whatsoever.
Tired of feeling guilty, weak, sad, tired, and reliant on this piece of garbage called nicotine.
I don't "hope" that I can do it. 
I WILL do it. I've had enough, and I'm done, for good, and forever.
Good bye Nicotine, you filthy deceptive whore. Fuck you and I 
never want you near me or in me, again. Dumb cunt.

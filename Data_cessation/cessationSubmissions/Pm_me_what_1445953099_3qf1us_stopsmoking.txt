Only smoke when I drink...very depressed about it.

I know drinking and smoking has been discussed a million times on here. But I've proven I don't need to smoke, I can go weeks, if I'm not drinking. I recently ran a marathon, was very proud of my achievements and then went out drinking and smoked the majority of a pack in one evening.  
I know the obvious answer - don't drink but then I'm giving up two "pleasures" at the same time.   
To be honest, I don't know what my question is, I'm just pretty depressed after a weekend away with my friends where I "needed" to smoke the whole time, because we were having drinks.

2 Weeks - Still Having Morning Cravings

So ignore the badge (I relapsed). It's been 2 weeks, and although I'm feeling pretty good with the quit, I still crave every morning. I'm doing this cold turkey, so the nicotine SHOULD be all out of my system by now. I'm not sure what's going on then. Does anybody else still have that 1 trigger you can't seem to shake?

day 4. Tomorrow I'm predicting a set back.

So I had my last cigarette Tuesday night about midnight before I went to bed. It's now Saturday night and today was the easiest by far. I'm feeling like I can do this no problem. Except of course, tomorrow there is a problem that I can't avoid. I'm going to a friends birthday/gathering/drinks thing and I'll be drinking, moderately at least is my intention however I do have a problem with binge drinking as I very rarely drink but do in social occasions like this which I haven't been to in a few months anyway. I also have social anxiety and I just predict that I will have a cigarette, because I think I will need it. Do you think it's okay for me to do it when I'm drinking as long as the next day I continue not too. Or if I allow myself a few or a couple just that night to get through it. Or will that kind of wipe off all my progress. I've also been running and working out a lot so I don't want that aspect to be back to a week ago before I started when I was getting stitches instantly and always out of breath. I don't know. help?

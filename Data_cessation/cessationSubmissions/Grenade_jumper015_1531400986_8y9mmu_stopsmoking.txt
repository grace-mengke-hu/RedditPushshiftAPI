Congratulations on quitting smoking... hereâ€™s all your teenage acne back in full force!

Wtf yâ€™all ðŸ™„ Three weeks cigarette free after 8 years of being a smoker. Lungs feel great, but my FACE looks like a PIZZA. I am 26 and havenâ€™t had acne since I was probably 15, but this is on a whole different level. This seems like a cruel reward.

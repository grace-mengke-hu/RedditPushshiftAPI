The grass must be greener

I just removed my badge, it would have been over 50 days, although it was about 30 days ago when I messed it all up. I was going through a very rough and stressful time and lit a smoke without even a thought. It was just there. I was back to my pack a day before I knew it.   
 I am very disappointed in myself for having not stuck with it, but I think I am ready and at that point to fulfill this mission.   
I figured that if I wrote this out, it would make me more serious about picking a day (Sunday!) and sticking with it. Telling myself 'tomorrow' isn't helping one bit.    
Thanks for reading a helpless smokers confession. I hope to make it though to the other side soon.

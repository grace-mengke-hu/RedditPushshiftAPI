One week in and I can’t function.

Hi y’all. I hit one week last night and I feel like absolute death. I have zero energy, a constant headache, and I can’t focus on anything for more than 5 seconds. My coworkers are annoyed, my dogs are restless and my roommates are worried about me. All I want to do is eat food and sleep. 

I’ve tried yoga, running, excessive water drinking, deep breathing, meditation, Advil. Nothing is helping. Luckily I don’t seem to be struggling with the psychological part of this. I really don’t want a cigarette. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. 

Tips?

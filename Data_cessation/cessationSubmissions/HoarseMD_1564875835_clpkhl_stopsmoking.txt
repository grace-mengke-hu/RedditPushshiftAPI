Smoking and My Sex Life.

I ended up cheating on my long term girlfriend of 4 years. We were pretty amazing together, until shit hit the fan. I used to be a occasional smoker, lighting up a cigarette when I hung out with my childhood friend, but the stress of cheating and lying pushed me into smoking every day to look for an out. I'm a vet student too, so exams were another excuse to get out and have a smoke as a study break to calm my nerves. Things began getting out of hand, when I realized my bad diet, lack of exercise and continued smoking (almost 3-4 singles a day) along with the mental guilt of what I'd done had taken a toll on my sex life. Being the person I was, it spiralled into problems with my already lacking self confidence and self esteem. Things went down hill from there, but didn't stop. The first girl (post my relationship) I had a casual fling with made my issues worse. To the point I narrowed it down to cigs and a lack of exercise.

Today, I'm stopping. Because I am better than that. I deserve better than to pay to kill my sex drive. I've made my peace with what I've done and saught forgiveness from the people I have hurt. And now cigarettes are the only thing that stand in my way towards a healthy mental and physical wellbeing. So I'm going to stop smoking. I'm going to stop because I know down the line I'm going to be proud of myself. I'm going to stop, because I've been given this body and it will be my first and last and I'm going to ride it till it withers away. I'm going to stop because I refuse to abuse. And with this, I will stop. There may be cigarettes after these words, but I know - I will never give it the power to consume me. The time has come for me to ash the habit and toss out the butts. The time has come, where I start afresh. The time has come.

Sincerely

More wilted than a Burnt out Butt.

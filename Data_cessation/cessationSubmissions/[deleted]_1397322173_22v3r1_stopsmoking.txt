Has anyone ever tried this method?

So, of course I've heard about people tapering off to quit smoking. Usually what this means is that they will smoke less cigarettes per day. They will spread them out further or skip a specific time when they usually have a cigarette.

However, there is another method. What if you were to smoke just as many cigarettes, but gradually smoke less of each one. For example, it takes me about 12 puffs to finish a cigarette. For the last 8 days I have been taking 1 puff less every 2 days. That means:

* Mon: 10 cigarettes at 12 puffs each.
* Tue: 10 cigarettes at 12 puffs each.
* Wed: 10 cigarettes at 11 puffs each.
* Th: 10 cigarettes at 11 puffs each.

Etc...I am at 8 right now.

So far, I notice no withdrawal effects at all. If anything, I think my cravings are less intense already. It is MUCH easier for me to deny myself the last puff of a mostly smoked cigarette than it is to deny myself completely of any kind of smoke after my usual times (morning, coffee, meals, etc.) - which is what it would take to go from 10 cigarettes a day to 9.

I plan to continue this method until I reach 1 puff and only then start lowering cigarettes per day, and hopefully at that point it will feel almost negligible. I will also probably increase the number of days that I stay at each level towards the end. For example, once I reach 5 puffs, I may wait 3 days instead of 2 to lower the puff-count again.

Although I like it so far, I'm not saying it works wonders, because I obviously haven't completed it yet. I am just wondering if anyone else has tried this????

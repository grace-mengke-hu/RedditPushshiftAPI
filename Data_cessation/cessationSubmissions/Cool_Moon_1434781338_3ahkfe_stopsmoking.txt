After 90 days I went back...

I have one cigarette to myself now and I DO NOT want to buy more.

I was a preacher of quitting, inspired two friends to quit with me with allen carrs book. I probably saved over $600 too.

I'm poor, it costs me 200-240 dollars to smoke how I do in a month (that's more than my car payment!).

I am a nursing student, I'm intelligent. I've had hands on a real black lung in a lab before.

I have a terrible terrible itchy, green mucus, smoker's cough.

What was I thinking, starting again for a few weeks? I am out!

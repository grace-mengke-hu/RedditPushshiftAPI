Removing my badge :(

I failed 30min ago, after 5 days. Bought a pack and smoked **Edit** "many" cigarettes. 


**So what have i learned from this quit?**

I have learned that I'm able to stay away from smokes for more than a few hours.

I have learned that smoking a cigarette after a few days off nicotine will give me absolutely nothing.

I have learned that for me the cravings is not the main problem, its the realization that i will never smoke again that makes it hard (i guess i feel robbed). I know I can't feel this way but I really did during this quit.

I have learned that an stop smoking app and these forums do help motivate me when I'm struggling.

Cranberry juice does help during the first few days when blood sugar levels are messed up.


**What should i do different during my next quit?**

I must work harder on removing the illusions of cigarettes as something positive. 

I think I will need something to keep my mind occupied. Thinking of cigarettes all the time (listening to Easy way and Joel Spitzer over and over and over during this quit might not be the smartest idea) I believe I need a mental break from cigarettes once in a while.

Focus on today, I will not worry about tomorrow, I will not worry about next week or the next year.


Keep up the good job everyone :) and don't do what i just did, it sucked

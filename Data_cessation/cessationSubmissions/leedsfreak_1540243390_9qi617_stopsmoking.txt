Smoking and obesity

Hey, so as the title suggests, I am obese (yay for me). I am currently 2 weeks smoke free but I can’t get rid of the hunger or urge to eat instead of smoke and the last thing I need to do right now is put on weight. Does anyone have any tips on how I can continue without putting on weight and please be nice, I hate being fat and really don’t need people calling me names because I’m really trying to sort my life out and get healthy one step at a time. Thank you.

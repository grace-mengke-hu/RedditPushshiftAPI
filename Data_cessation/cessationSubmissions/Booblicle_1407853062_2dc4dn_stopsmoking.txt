Present thoughts on addiction.

Recent news of Robin Williams death is heartbreaking. Worst is that he suffered from an addiction he was able to cull 20 years previously. 20 years, puts him roughly to what my age is now - down to the year in fact. It has made me ponder a few questions. Questions I probably don't have actual answers to, but I guess I could try, at least for myself. But i'm sure some of you have stopped to wonder also, even if privately 

Robin Williams was a hell of a man. I would believe that to understand joy and happiness is to understand sadness and despair. More-so, He probably carried a very great burdens of understanding of human nature. I'll try not to ponder too deeply how this relates to his depression, and alcoholism, but I'm sure there's a link. 

Part of this link I think might have to do with this so called 12 step  program. where they seem to enforce the idea that you are forever enslaved to being a drinker.  There was a small debate concerning this between myself and a few others in the past threads, maybe someone could dig it up as I'm reddit stupid. 

I believe It's something that Allen Carr seems to have figured out, that to quit smoking, you must stop thinking like a smoker and that you are never strapped to that addiction.  

At least this is my sincere hope. Because, right now I don't see myself ever picking up another cigarette no matter how bad a trigger or stress gets. 

A lot of you guys are probably still within your first days, weeks and months. For those struggling, change your mindset, keep your spirits high and you've got the rest covered. 

Sorry about the wall of text. It was just burning at my mind.

5 years

Tomorrow will be five years no smoking for me. I smoked at least a pack and a half a day for the last ten years I was a smoker.  Considerably more when I was drinking. It was the first thing I did when I woke up in the morning and the last thing I did before bed. The first year was tough. Sort of have to relearn how to live but I did it. Probably the best decision/accomplishment I have ever made. I unsuccessfully quit a handful of times before it stuck. So hang in there if you're just starting out and keep trying if you fail. It's absolutely worth it.

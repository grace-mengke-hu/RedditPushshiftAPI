2 months down and I still feel terrible

So after roughly 15 years of a pack a day+ I quit smoking cold turkey two months ago today. I loved smoking, know lots of smokers, and wasn't afraid of cancer so my only real incentive for quitting is that I've constantly been told I would feel better. 

I wanted to increase my "wind" for sex and working out, and I was told that if I stopped chain smoking I'd see drastic improvement. I read that there can be a period after you quit where you feel worse, but everything I've found says that should be over by now. 

I've been congested since I quit, even walking stairs has me breathing hard now, and I'm constantly exhausted. 

When is this going to end? Do I need to see a doctor? (Not a big fan outside of emergencies so I'm only doing that if there is cause for panic.) 

Smoking was one of my favorite things in the world, as silly as that sounds, so this is really killing my motivation. I only gave it up because I thought it was going to make a massive improvement in my endurance, if that isn't true than I want my favorite vice back.

Has anyone experienced this? What is the problem here?

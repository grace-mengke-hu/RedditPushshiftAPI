My dreams are scaring me

I have been smoke free for three months + and I'm overall happy. Once in a while I have awful dreams about smoking or buying a pack and realizing I can smoke a cigarette. In these dreams I'll sit there take a few puffs and enjoy. The scary part to me is in my waking state... It's like I've cheated or the dream felt so real and vivid that I've relapsed.

In reality I since I've quit, cold turkey, I haven't had any symptoms or desire to pick up and light a cigarette.

In fact for the first two weeks I kept the 7 cigarettes I had in my last pack and slowly handed them out.

I don't know what to make of this and I wanted to share this with some one, any one. Maybe one of you would know if in partial how I feel.

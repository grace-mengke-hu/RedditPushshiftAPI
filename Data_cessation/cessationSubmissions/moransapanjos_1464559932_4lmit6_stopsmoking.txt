I'd really like to quit

Greetings, everyone!

I have been smoking for the past 9-10 years (I am 23 years old at the moment).

I have tried quitting numerous times, and have succeeded for 4 months last year (thanks to Allen Carr). One night I was out with my wife and friends, had a few drinks and decided to light one up (DUMBEST decision in my life. Ever.), and I got hooked again, of course. 

Since then, I have read Allen Carr's book 3-4 times but to no avail, keep relapsing like a fool although I know what's happening in my head!

On another note, my workplace is quite stressful and even if I don't smoke in the morning when I walk my dog (and I do), I eventually end up smoking when I come to work... but when I return home, I have no issue being without a cigarette until the next morning (I don't even have to have a pack, but I'll buy one in the morning on the way to work). 

Now, I am waiting any day now for my wife to give birth to a lovely baby girl, and I'd honestly like to raise her without the cigarette stench surrounding me, and I'd like to be able to run and play with her around the playground for more than 10 seconds without losing my breath.

If anyone has an advice, I am all ears. 
Thank you in advance!

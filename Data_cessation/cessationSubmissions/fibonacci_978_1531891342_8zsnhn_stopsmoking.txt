I've gone 12 days without smoking but I feel the urge now more than ever

About two weeks ago I took a look at the floor of my car and was disgusted and amazed by all the empty cigarette boxes. That was the first thing that made me want to quit, the second was that it was no longer pleasurable to smoke and I could actually feel it damaging my lungs. The first week I was on that quitters rush, I got back into my gym routine started eating healthier and started sleeping longer at night. I'm still doing all of those things but the side effects from cessation are beginning to outweigh the reasons I quit. I've lost all my motivation I've begun to slack at my business my focus is fucked and I've been feeling depressive and moody. How long can I expect this to last because when I was smoking cigarettes I was at the top of my game and now I feel terrible and stressed. I can't talk to my girlfriend about this because if I ever want to get her to quit I can't tell her how I'm feeling so I thought I'd turn to you guys.

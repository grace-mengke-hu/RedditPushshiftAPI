Maybe it’s the last time

I’ve been here a few times, one way or another. (That reminds me, should probably update my flair). I’ve been smoking for over 10 years now... crazy.

Three weeks ago I bought a vape on a whim. I’ve had one cigarette since and I hated it. Now even being near the smell of cigarettes makes me feel ill. I haven’t missed it at all. I’m looking forward to taking the strength of the juice down a notch to see what it feels like to gradually quit.

Could this be the last time? I truly hope so.

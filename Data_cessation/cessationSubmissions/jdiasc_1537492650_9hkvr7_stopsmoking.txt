Positive thinking

Im only 9 hours through, but im so excited about being a non-smoker, about reconnecting with my old self - someone who wasnt aways anxious about having enought cigarretes for the evening, thinking about stores nearby. I'm so excited about the freedom. Feeling my lungs, my blood and my body coming back to what they were 4 years ago. I'm 23 but im not willing to get 40 to realize i've messed up with my body. Im doing this now, while there are no permanent damages. Im happy to have found this place where i can read and connect with the same feelings im having, i hope i can help, cause writing it encourages me even more.

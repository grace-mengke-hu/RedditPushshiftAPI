Here we go again. Badge reseted. I really wanna kick this habit!

So I think this is the 3rd time I reset my badge in this subreddit.

I have since quit twice for a couple of months. Last time around I stayed "clean" for about 5 months, picked up running again and did 10k every two days. 
For some reason I decided it'd be a great idea to try a smoke again. Needless to say, it didn't stay at one smoke. over the last 6 month I have worked myself up to being back at half a pack a day again.

So today I was pretty hungover from a party last night and thus didn't smoke much. For some reason I decided to go for a smoke before dinner just because, you know, I hadn't smoked all day. Good lord was that cigarette disgusting. I instantly grabbed my pack and threw it into the trash.

Withdrawl symptoms here I come! Good thing that it's a short work week :-) This time around I really wanna kick it for good. Wish me luck reddit.

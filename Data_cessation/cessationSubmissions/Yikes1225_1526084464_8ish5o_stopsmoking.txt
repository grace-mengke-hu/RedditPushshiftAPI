Excuse my language please

Fuck fuck fuck

Sorry.
4.5 days and I smoked.
I could feel it building all day. I got home from work and gorged on chips and dip.
Then I googled smoking relapse. I was actually looking for permission, reveling in the words of support offered to those who relapsed. 
Then I went out and bought a pack. 

So I smoked half, lungs actually burned, didnâ€™t enjoy it. But I smoked.

Now I have a pack of cigarettes and 3 cans of beer that I bought to numb my disappointment in myself.

Quit smoking fail.

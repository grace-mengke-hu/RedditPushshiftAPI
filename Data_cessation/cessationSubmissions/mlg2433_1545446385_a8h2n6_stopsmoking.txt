Been ten days since my last cigarette.

I’ve been using an e-cig to help curb the nicotine addiction. I’ve always heard that your taste and smell slowly come back. This is true. Downside? Cigarettes smell soooo fucking good. I hate it lol. Walking by the smokers table going into work is a nightmare.

Came here to check my 100 day flair and pass on an important message to everyone with one 14 and Under.

You're going to make it.  

You *can* do this.  

It's gonna suck at some points, but you have to remember that quitting is the most important decision of your life because it will save your life.

The thing that helped me the most was writing down, on a daily basis, reasons why I wanted to stop smoking.  I re-read those notes every day when I had cravings.  It was a tremendous help.  

Pamper yourself however you want while you're in the first month.  Just don't smoke.  Follow the golden rule: Not One More Puff, Ever Again.  You'll be at your 100 days before you know it.

Be proud of yourself for picking this fight.  **You're gonna win it.**

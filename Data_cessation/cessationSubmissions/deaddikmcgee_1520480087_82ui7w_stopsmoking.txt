I'm ready

Hi, guys. I'm ready to quit smoking cigarettes. I started at 18 and I'm 28 now. It's time to be done with this is habit. I know it's going to be tough. And I'm doing it cold turkey, but I will be strong in my resolve.

I've always said, "I need to quit smoking." This time I say, "I ***will*** quit smoking." So let's do this. It begins now.

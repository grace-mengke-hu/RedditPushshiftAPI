120 Days.  I visited the dentist.

It's been 7 years since I had a dentist visit, so there's been more neglect than just smoking to my teeth and gums, but the cleanup process was intense.  I had a "deep cleaning" (periodontal root planing) and there were points where the hygienist was able to show me some of the crap that she chiseled out from under my gums...

It wasn't an "enjoyable" process, but she got the tobacco stains off my teeth, and cleaned out years of neglect.  

I'm just floored by how severely smoking impacted my dental health.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but seeing the stuff that was just chipped out of my mouth...

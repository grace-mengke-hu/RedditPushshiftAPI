Serious question for you, ladies and gents...

So, I smoked about a pack a day for 7 years. A few weeks ago, after some persuasion from a few friends, I elected to get an ecig. It's one of the ones that takes the juice, and has adjustable voltage (ego-CTwist). 

Anyways, I've tried cold turkey, Chantix, all kinds of things, and never managed to stay off cigarettes for more than a few days. I had zero faith that vaping would prove to be the method that finally worked. 

I'm happy to report, however, that I was wrong. I am now over two weeks without a cigarette and don't see any chance of slipping up at this point. 

Now, onto the question. I've basically substituted inhaling smoke that contains nicotine and a cocktail of other carcinogenic chemicals for a vapor that contains nicotine, under the guise of being "less harmful." I don't want to debate the truthfulness of these claims, because frankly, it seems there hasn't been enough actual research into the potential health risks associated with vaping. Anyways, to get to the point, I am having a hard time deciding if quitting smoking actual cigarettes and replacing it with vaping is something to be celebrated, since the underlying addiction is still there, or if it is not an accomplishment at all, and rather just me substituting one issue with another (debatably less bad) issue. 

Tl;dr quit smoking after seven years in favor of vaping. Having trouble feeling "proud" of this accomplishment. Please weigh in.

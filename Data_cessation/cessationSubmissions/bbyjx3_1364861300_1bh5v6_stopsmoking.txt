So I posted here a week ago complaining about my inadequacies at the gym, but almost two weeks later I'm pushing 3.5 miles!

I was freaking out because my lungs felt completely incapacitated the first day I quit smoking and hauled my ass to the gym. However, with some awesome and sound advice from you guys I bared down on the embarrassment and trooped over to the gym for the past two weeks. Today was the day I ran 3.5 miles on the treadmill in 53 minutes. I know I have a long way to go, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement. I really couldn't have done it without reading through all of your posts and knowing that I'm not alone.

For anyone who's trying to quit, exercising really takes your mind off of smoking. First, it reminds you of how much shit you put your lungs through when you first start your routine. Then, as the days pass and your lungs slowly regenerate you start to feel in control.

Thanks again guys!

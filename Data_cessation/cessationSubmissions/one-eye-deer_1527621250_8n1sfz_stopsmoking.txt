I'm here on my second quit; my last quit was back in 2016 for around nine months. I began smoking again in September 2016 and did so daily until April 26th, 2018. I've been smoking since around 2012, so on-off for around 6 years now.

This quit has been surprisingly easier than expected. I quit cold turkey, and haven't had many major cravings; I had a personal emergency happen in my life early on in this quit which almost caused me to relapse (that was the strongest craving I've had!), but other than that, it hasn't been as difficult as the first. I'm a bit nervous, since I was expecting it to be a bit more...difficult? 

Anyone else experience something like this? I've been waiting for the day that a strong craving slaps me right in the face and the journey becomes difficult, but so far, it really hasn't happened. It can't be this easy, right?

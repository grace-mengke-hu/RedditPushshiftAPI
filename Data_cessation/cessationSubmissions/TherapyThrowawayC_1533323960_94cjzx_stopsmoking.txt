Best way to get rid of the cigarette smell from room/clothes?

This might be a little offtopic but this Monday I quit smoking and I wanna get rid of the smell from my room and furniture. My parents are avid smokers, so I'll never be able to completely get rid of the smell.

This weekend I plan to wipe everything clean using vinegar and water and I already have a cup of vinegar in my room with some baking soda next to it. 

The biggest problem is my wooden desk. It reeks of cigarette smell and I'm not sure how I can clean it. 

I'm also washing the carpet this weeaked, and the windows. 

What else should I do? What other tricks do you know to get rid of the smell?

Need advice to help my girlfriend stop smoking

So a bit of background info, we have been together 3 years and she (f23) has been smoking since she was 15 (9 years) and she wants to quit. She has always kept setting a date to quit then keeps pushing the date so it was all just to keep smoking.

Nearly every month when she gets paid she would end up oweing me or her mother nearly Â£200 because of her addiction. We are planing on moving in together and I would like for us to save up a good bit of money to kick start that. As it stands I'm not to optomistic about that.

It's not just the money part of it I'm looking at, I've have an uncle who smoked all his life and in recent years he's had lung and throat cancer. He was a well built man and seeing him now as a frail old man in a wheelchair is somewhat sad. I really don't want something like that for her as I love her too much.

Arguments are plentyfull about smoking and I would try and prove to her how smoking pointless is. She would always retaliate with "you don't understand" and "only I can make myself quit". She has tried on several ocasions and has even tried reading books but to no avail.

She wants to quit and im hoping you good people of reddit will offer some sound advice. Thanks reddit army.

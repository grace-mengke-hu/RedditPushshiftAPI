Motivated a friend to stop smoking

We were eating at subway this afternoon with a non smoker and a smoker friend of mine. Right before going in the subway my smoker friend went to buy a pack of rolling tobacco like i used to do for two years. While we were eating i tried to talk him through stopping smoking wich lead to him not wanting to. 20 minutes later we were talking/eating whatever and my smoker friend just stood up , went to the sandwich making station , asked the only customer who was there if he was a smoker and then just gave him the pack. When he came back at the table he just told us he was done with the cost, the addiction and everything. I'm proud of my friend for doing that and I hope he'll keep going strong.

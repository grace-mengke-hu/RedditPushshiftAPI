Almost 4 years as a an ex-smoker. Your help was invaluable!

Dear community, it will soon be four days since the last time I had a cigarette. I haven’t missed it for one second. In my mind, I feel like I have never smoked and can’t even remember how it feels to inhale nicotine. All I know is my life is better. No doubt about it. And I can only encourage all smokers out there to start the path. It isn’t easy. But the lifetime reward is worth the effort. Trust me. I still can’t believe I (a lost case!) manage to quit. I am a good example, everyone can eventually make it. Thanks community for all your knowledge and support over the years. Wish you a great year end and may 2019 bring only happiness!

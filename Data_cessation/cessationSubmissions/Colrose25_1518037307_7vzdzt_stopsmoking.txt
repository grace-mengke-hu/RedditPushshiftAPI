Will it ever go away

I still, after 23 days, want to smoke. Not all the time but when I think of going away this weekend and spending time drinking with other adults I automatically think about smoking. None of them smoke so it isn’t that. I don’t want to end up miserable because I can’t smoke. Wtf is wrong with me??

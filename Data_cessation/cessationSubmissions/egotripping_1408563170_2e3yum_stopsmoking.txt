This is the farthest I've made it in years, and I feel like I really have a handle on it this time.

Longtime /r/stopsmoking reader, I've probably tried to quit 100s of times, with most attempts not making it past the first 2 days. 

This time something is different though.  I'm tired of waking up with a mouth like an ashtray.  I'm tired of hiding my smoking.  I'm tired of asking strangers for a smoke when I'm too far from a convenience store to get a pack only to get a fucking newport.  I'm tired of spending 10 minutes here and there to go out for breaks at work.  I'm tired having pathetic lung capacity.  I'm tired of pay $12+ a pack in Chicago.  I'm tired of being looked down upon.

I'm tired of being a smoker, and I no longer want to smoke.  I've really got a grip on this time, and I don't want to ever smoke again.  I stopped getting cravings at work about 5 days into it.  My only worry is when I go out on the weekends and get plastered.  It's so easy to rationalize smoking then, especially when so many of my friends smoke.  For this reason I specifically didn't go out last weekend, but I can't keep that up forever.  Any tips or words of encouragement, stopsmoking?

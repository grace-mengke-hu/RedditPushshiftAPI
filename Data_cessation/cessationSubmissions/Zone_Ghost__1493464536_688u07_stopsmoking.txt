I slipped up today

161 days smoke and nicotine free but today I slipped up. I smoked an old tobacco pipe I had laying around, I had two bowls out of it tonight, feel very embarrassed and regret within myself. I didn't inhale but i felt the nicotine hold start to creep in, an absolutely horrible feeling that I regret.

I just broke the pipe and threw out the tobacco. I'm not letting the three hour mistake undo all the progress I've made the past 161 days and stop me from living the rest of my life smoke and nicotine free. I'm now re-committed to a smoke free life.

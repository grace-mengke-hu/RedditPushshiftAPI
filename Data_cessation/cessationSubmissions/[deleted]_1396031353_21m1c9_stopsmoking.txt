Hit my 24 hour mark of no smoking

23 y/o male from that part of Asia where a pack of Marlboro reds 20s cost USD2.50 and the cheaper packs cost less than a dollar.

First 24 hours of not lighting up.

My nose is stuffed up like crazy, and I keep coughing up a shit storm. Quit cold turkey from 7-10 sticks a day for a year, started a year ago due to exam stress. 

Funny thing is I'm studying to be a dentist. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing. 



Edit: I'm in my last year of dentistry.

Im treating patients with all sorts of oral cancers or oral lesions caused by smoking or chewing tobacco. They come in a dime a dozen and for a good many months in my mind I was still "This won't happen to me" and I shut the reasoning part of my brain off.

One day last week this dude walks in. He's 14 years old and he's been smoking those cheap cigarettes and chewing tobacco for 4 years. He tries to open his mouth...barely. He could only open it a couple of centimeters an inch at most. It was oral submucous fibrosis. His cheeks were completely fibrous, hard, tough and melded together.   

We tell him it's serious, he needs to go for surgery. He gets upset and says "Give me some pills to cure me". It doesn't work that way, and he hasn't got money for the surgery anyway. He walks away. 

I go out for lunch break and there the 14 year old kid was, sitting on a bench, smoking with his barely-openable mouth. I broke. I told myself I don't want to become like him. Not this, not cancer, not copd, nothing. I want to be healthy.

So I'm quitting.

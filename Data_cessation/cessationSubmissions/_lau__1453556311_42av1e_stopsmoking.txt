Coping with negative emotions

I quit 16 days ago and I' ve been feeling quite nice except for some cravings,but today I am feeling deeply depressed and meaningless. Im not afraid of relapsing because I homestly dont fancy a cig it is just that what I used to do when feeling this way was smoking. And now I dont know what to do.
Just wanted to vent thanks for reading!:)

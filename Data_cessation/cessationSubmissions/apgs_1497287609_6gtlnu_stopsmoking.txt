I stopped smoking almost 6 years ago and I never looked back, AMA.

I've been smoking a pack a day for more than 10 years until I quit cold turkey in 2011 and it's been one of the best (maybe the best) decisions in my life. 

Hey thanks for questions everybody. I realised that even though i quit cold turkey and it was very easy for me, i really don't know how i did it. So the only thing i can say is that it's so much better to be a non smoker, please please don't give up and cross that line forever.

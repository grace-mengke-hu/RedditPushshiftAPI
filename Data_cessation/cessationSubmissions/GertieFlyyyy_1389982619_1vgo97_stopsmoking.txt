Day 5

So, I quit with Chantix. I've been taking it since January 6th, and as recommended I didn't smoke after the first week. I COULDN'T smoke after the first week. This medicine has given me such incredible nausea that I have to lay down and will myself not to be sick for an hour after taking the medicine. This happens to a lesser extent if I take it with food, but it's still pretty bad.

I haven't had so many psychological effects. The stress of my spouse and I quitting at the same time has made us [VERY] snippy towards each other. Especially since he kept smoking while I was sick on the medicine, and the cigarette smell made me sick.

The dreams have not been bad. I very rarely had dreams before Chantix, but I dream every night now. Mild, off the wall stuff. Mostly comical enough to tell coworkers the next day.

The important thing I have realized about Chantix is that it is not a cure-all for smoking. Chantix alone will not make you quit. Chantix is buying you time to replace your psychological addiction to cigarettes with something else. You still have to say no to that cigarette craving. Because you know it will restart the 3-day countdown. Because it will taste like burnt asshole and won't even do anything for you while you're on the medicine. Because you've come so far already and what the fuck why am I going to do that all over again?

Anyway, that's my story.

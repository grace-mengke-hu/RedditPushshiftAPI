I can't seem to maintain my motivation.

I've quit several times before and failed. Each time I feel like it isn't that I can't overcome the addiction, I just lose the drive to want to be a non-smoker. The desire to maintain a new healthy lifestyle wears off. Anybody else have this problem, or have any idea how to overcome it?

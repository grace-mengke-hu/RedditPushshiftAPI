Just threw out my JUUL wish me luck...

Already feeling anxious. I had quit for 10 years (smoking) started juuling off and on last December, I feel shitty and lethargic, it absolutely consumes me, I spend so much time with it and smoke it wherever I can often in the bathroom many times a day to hide it...

I've had enough!

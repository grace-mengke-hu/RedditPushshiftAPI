I'm gonna do it!

This is it! I've looked through this subreddit and I've finally decided it's time. No more excuses, no more feeling bad, no more coughing, no more smelling and no more years taken off my life.

I'm quitting cold turkey, just had my last smoke EVER and downloaded kick smoking apps on my phone. 


My boyfriend is out of town, so hopefully the first few days where I'm gonna be a maniac I can't take it out on him :D

Thank you guys for giving me the courage to do this!

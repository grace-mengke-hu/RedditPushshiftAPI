Cigarettes are fucking evil..

So I quit smoking on the 13th August this year. About a week after I quit, my grandmother suddenly fell ill. 

She has been a smoker for 60 years. SIXTY YEARS!

We were hoping her illness was nothing to do with smoking, but deep down we always had it in the back of our minds.

She goes to the doctor, she is given an X-ray and told that she has an abnormal spot on her lungs. Uh oh, this can't be good. The docs tell us it's possibly lung cancer. 

Few weeks pass and tensions are high, we are told it is lung cancer, and that she is also suffering from emphysema (she recently started having breathing troubles too). This is a woman that went from having all the energy in the world (not fitness energy, but cleaning/cooking/chatty energy) to somebody that's now unrecognizable in the short span of 2 months..

Going through all this solidified my reasoning to stay off the smokes. They are pure fucking evil.

The worst part? She is still smoking... I don't think that it's even possible to quit after 60 years..

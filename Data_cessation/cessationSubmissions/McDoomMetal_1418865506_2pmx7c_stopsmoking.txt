32 years of smoking ends at midnight tonight - question on rewards.

I've been smoking since I was 16. 
It's my 49th birthday today and tonight I am done at midnight. 

Cold turkey. 

I'm obsessed that I won't have anything to look forward to. No reward. 
Scared of gaining weight - joined a gym. 
Got the apps. 
Got the candy, celery and straws. 

I heard it will be hell for the first week. 
My fear is that the withdrawal will be much much longer. 

I'm super excited to quit because my husband will start to make out with me again. 

I want to do this. I have to kick. 

What kinds of rewards did you use to replace cigarettes?

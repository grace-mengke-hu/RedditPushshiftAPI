Day 4, using the patch

Just need to vent for a sec. I want to eat all the foods, smoke all the cigarettes, and slap most of the people I come into contact with. I am somewhat constipated, but have diarrhea at the same time (didn't know this was possible). I've quit before, and I don't remember feeling this bad. Whine over.

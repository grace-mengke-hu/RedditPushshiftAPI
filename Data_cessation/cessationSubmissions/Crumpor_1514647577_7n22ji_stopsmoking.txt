2 Months!

Honestly, I don't feel that much different - but then again, I never smoked a huge amount to begin with (2-3 packs a week, this is compared to other smokers I know), nor had any health problems as a result. But I also don't feel any drive _to_ smoke anymore, which is nice. I can enjoy things without constantly thinking of my next smoke, and I'm not constantly worrying about how many I've got left, etc. - major peace of mind. 2018 will be my first year for 10 years smoke free, and I'm actually looking forward to it.

One side effect is that my appetite has all but disappeared, which is strange (but not entirely unwelcome) - everyone else I've talked to has mentioned that their appetite went through the roof instead.

smoking while driving - my biggest pitfall

Hey everyone, I posted earlier and today is my first day of the quitting process. I'm nervous about tomorrow though while I'm driving because this is usually the time I smoke, whether it's on my way to work or classes.

Is there anyone else who used to smoke while driving a lot, and how did you fix it?

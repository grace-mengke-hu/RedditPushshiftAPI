Starting a new job

I'm training for a new job for two days. Today Is day one and it's the strongest craving I've had. I'm really resisting the urge to just bum a cigarette off of someone. I know if I do though I'll regret it. I hope the stress of starting a new job doesn't cause me to start smoking again.

4 days.

I have been smoke free for 4 days. 
I’m 31 and have smoked since I was 15, I never thought this would happen.

I didn’t intend to quit, I had 2 teeth pulled last Thursday, and I planned to smoke after 3 or 4 days. He fear of dry socket outweighed the cravings and made them manageable.
Now at day 4 I feel great, have very minor cravings and so much more energy.

I have a few left from the day of my tooth extraction, I was going to smoke a cigarette with my morning coffee today, and said ‘Why?’
It would be silly to, I want to, but I don’t need to. 
So I cracked them in half and threw them away. 
Screw cigarettes, I’m a non smoker.

My father died a few months ago and while he was in the hospital I promised him I would quit, so here I am!

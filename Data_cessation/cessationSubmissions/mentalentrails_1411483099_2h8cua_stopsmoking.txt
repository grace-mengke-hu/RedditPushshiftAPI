almost a week

it's almost been my first week. My moodiness has been getting a little better. The wife and I are still having our spats here and there but now depression is setting in. I find looking at a random porn pic helps get rid of the odd cravings for a cig, just gives me a little spurt of dopamine. No relapses this time, not even tiny drags. I used to be a meth addict as a teen, quitting cigs has been soooo much harder than quitting meth was, and at the time I thought that was one of the hardest things i had ever done.

trying to fill that void

So, I'm a bit past two months now, but I cant help but feel as though there is a void in my life now. A sense of monotony almost. I wake up and have nothing to look forward to, except for my cups of coffee. I am not really getting cravings anymore, in fact I am feeling almost nothing. I feel like getting shit faced drunk or getting stoned might fill that void and help me feel better, but I know that wont solve this issue. Anyways, anyone else get this feeling of monotony if so, how did you cope?

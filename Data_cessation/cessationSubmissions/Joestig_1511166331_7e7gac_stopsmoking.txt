Alcohol makes it more likely for me to relapse. How do I deal with this?

I have quit smoking many times over the past years, but every now and then I relapsed, and often this was due to alcohol, which lowers my willpower. Normally I don't even think about smoking, but somehow it seems like a good idea when I drunk too much.

Now that I quit (58 hours ago) and this time I want it to be for good, I am thinking of all factors that cause me to relapse and I intend to make appropriate lifestyle changes if necessary. What options do I have in this case?

Thanks in advance! :)

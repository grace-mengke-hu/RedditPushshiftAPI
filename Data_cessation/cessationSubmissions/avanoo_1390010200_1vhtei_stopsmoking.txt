The one-minute hack for never putting a cigarette in your mouth again - even when you feel the desire. What works for you?

Background: It's been a long time since I've smoked anything. But while other people can say once they quit it became disgusting for them, that hasn't been the case for me. I still get cravings. But that doesn't mean I act on them. Because, years later, I still use this quick hack: 

The no smoking hack (This can be done when you have a craving or, even better, before the craving ever hits): Think about all the reasons you don't need that cigarette - your health, your family, the things you want to do later in life, etc. Then remind yourself why you are strong enough to stay away: your mental strength, previous victories against smoking on previous days, etc. Then see yourself, strong, without a cigarette or the need to smoke one. That's it. When you're done, the craving will likely be gone. 

How to do the hack: There are many ways to make the hack a part of your life. You can do it purely as a meditation, you can have quotes and things around the house, or - like me - you can get email reminders to view inspirational images like these: http://placeboeffect.com/rprescription?id=273. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something you can come back to time and time again, and something that works for you! 

Okay, that's my quick smoking hack. Would love to hear yours too!

Needing to constantly clear your throat?

It's probably from smoking, right? Do you guys feel like you have to do it *very* often? Or have you felt that before (if you're now a non-smoker)?

My throat also feels really dry. I drink more water than most people (probably) do. But the thing is, drinking more water doesn't really help. It should but it doesn't. My throat still hurts and feels dry, and the phlegm is still there...how gross is that? what am I doing to myself...?

I'm looking forward to this reconstructive process. My body wants and needs to feel normal again.

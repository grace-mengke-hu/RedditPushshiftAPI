I gave in...

Gave in yesterday. Had a few drinks, was at a party with smokers, and bummed 3 cigarettes. Was about to celebrate 1 week smoke free; amazing how fast you can fall off the wagon. Oh well, back to square one. My commitment to being smoke free is still as strong as ever. Join me in not smoking today!

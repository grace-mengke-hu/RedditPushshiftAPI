Quitting

I want to quit so bad. I've been smoking almost a pack a day for 5 years. 

It's almost been an entire day since i have smoked. The cravings seem to get worse and worse. 

Is it cheating to get an e-cig? I've tried patches and gum but not too into them. 

I had this whole mentality that i was going to quit cold turkey. 

Any advice is appreciated.

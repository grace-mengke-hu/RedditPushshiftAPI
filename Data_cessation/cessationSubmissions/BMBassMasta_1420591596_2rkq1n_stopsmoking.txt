Clean Since Christmas!

Well the day I decided to quit I commented on someone's post here and since then I touched 1 smoke, fad a couple puffs and just felt sick. Since then I've gotten 2 friends that Im sure I made start, quit. My boss is really happy with me and I feel great. Im glad to say ill never start again.

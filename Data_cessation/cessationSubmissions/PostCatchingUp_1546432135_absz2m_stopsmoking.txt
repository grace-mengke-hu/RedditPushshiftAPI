Waiting for the stress to leave

Hey to all of the ex-smokers fam! I'm about to hit 2 weeks but I have a bit of a worry I was hoping someone might know about. I suffer from anxiety and I used smoking as a way to really relieve me from those feelings but now I'm 2 weeks in and feeling a lot healthier but I've somewhat back pedalled on my mental health and haven't been very clear headed since stopping. Will this get better with time and are there any tips/ tricks for dealing with this? Thanks guys!

Another convert....

On New Year's day I was investigating using chantix/champix or electronic cigarettes as a means of breaking my 35 year old smoking habit. Then on some site I found mention of "Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking" 

A cynic I thought the people singing it's praises were paid posters but it had too many supporters. throughout the internet,  for it to be an organised marketing effort. There had to be some substance behind it's success. My guess was it worked only on morons.....

Well call me an idiot.... I bought the book and two hours later I was astonished to find that I was ripping up my last packet of smokes and throwing them in a bucket of water.

I believe the main reason the book worked, for me, was it changed my mindset regarding the benefits of smoking. i use to think if I didn't have a smoke I wouldn't be able to concentrate or cope as well with stress. I now know/believe I was wrong. In saying that I don't ascribe to Allen Carr's belief that smoking has absolutely no positive benefits I just see it's benefits as so trivial that they are inconsequential.

Anyway, I think every smoker wishing to quit should read this book. While there is no guarantee you will give up i know for a significant number of people it will inspire them to quit

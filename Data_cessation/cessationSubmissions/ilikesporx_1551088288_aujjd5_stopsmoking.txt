This has been quite the struggle.

It has been six months of being smoke free and I still crave them every single day.

Despite feeling so much better health wise, (I absolutely LOVE being able to run up the stairs without feeling like I am going to die) I still can't seem to get my stress under control. 

I have had to go through this alone since my family wasn't aware of my habit. 

Anyone have any tips? TIA ðŸ˜Š

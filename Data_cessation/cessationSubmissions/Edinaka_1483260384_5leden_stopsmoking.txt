Hello guys! I'm new here!

- I am 25 years old and smoke from 12 years. 

- I managed to stop cigarettes 5 times from 2012 till 2017 for about 3 and a half years in total. My longest streak is around 2 years without a cigarette. 

- I don't want to fail again. I had mostly social triggers in the past, which tricked me into starting them again. One hit from a cigarette is enough to ruin all your hard work.

After several unsuccessful attempts (it gets harder and harder) I managed to quit cold turkey (that's what works for me) one month ago. I didn't even think about cigarettes for that one month - it's like they don't even exist. 

My problem is that I got very sick! 3 weeks ago I started coughing up brown phlegm and got the flu. I went through antibiotics - nothing helped. I got asthma attacks at work and I don't have asthma since 20 years. My whole mouth was in ulcers, which got a little better. I thought something at my workplace triggered my asthma and was ready to quit my job. Instead I agreed to take 5 days off, was really emotional, because I couldn't breathe at all. 

Is it because of cigarettes, because I never experienced so severe withdrawal symptoms before? Is something at my workplace triggering my childhood asthma? Anyone has experience with something similar - does it ever get better?

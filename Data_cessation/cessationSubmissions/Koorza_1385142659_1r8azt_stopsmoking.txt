Is it allright if I go into a hookah bar?

I am on my 3rd day. Really no big cravings at all. I am actually enjoying the process. However, I am scared that even when I don't smoke, I will inhale the smoke from the others and maybe get hooked again. Also my lungs are recovering right now and I really don't want the process to be hindered. Would that happen if I'd go to this place.

Smoke-Free 56 days and now THIS!?

Okay, so right. I quit smoking. I started vaping. Apart from the sickness in week two of my body throwing out all the junk I'd accumulated (just over two years' worth) it hasn't been that bad, because on a technicality I'm still ON nicotine. 

Great. Everything is great. 

Except for the past 5 days. Every. Single. Day I'm having this overwhelming desires for an analogue. I dont want a pack, I dont even think I could smoke a whole cig, I just want like 1/3 of one so I can remember that I'm done with it. To "get it out of my system" so to speak. I always said I'd be happy to get down to 1 a day, and for the past 56 I have had 0. I'm happy with that, I am. I accept that I would totally take a social smoke. But I dont want to buy a whole pack and risk slipping back into it. 

Just 1/3 of a cigarette. Am I going crazy? Has anyone else gone through this and if so, how did you cope!?

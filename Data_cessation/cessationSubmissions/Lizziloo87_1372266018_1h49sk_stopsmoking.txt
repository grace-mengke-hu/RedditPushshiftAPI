Day 1!! I am trying Chantix..

In the past I've attempted to quit tons of times. The two almost successful times (11 months and then 4 months) were done by cold turkey style. Yet, one slip up and I was back to being a full time smoker again. Other ways I've tried were patches, lozenges and gum.

This time I'm trying Chantix, I know that it is kind of controversial but I'm hoping that it will do the trick. I like that I can smoke up to day 7, so I can start now weening myself off. (In fact, I have only had 1 smoke today, when by now (noon) I usually have had at least 4 or 5.) I've heard that it does work, but the side effects are redonk.

Has anyone else tried Chantix, what did you think?

Also, wish me luck and dedication! I'll need it !!

So I haven't made the "official" decision to quit smoking for good and it's made it super easy

I've smoked for about 8 years, although I haven't smoked heavily on a daily basis lately. I averaged probably about 2-3 packs a week, more if I did a lot of drinking or the like.

I recently stopped smoking and I still haven't told myself or anyone that I "quit" smoking. I just say I haven't smoked for a couple of weeks. I tell myself I'm just not going to smoke anything *today*. Knowing my contrarian nature, I figure if I say I'm NEVER going to smoke again, I will be battling wild horses from then on out. But by making no promises beyond today, I've found it fairly easy. 

I've even partied hard and still haven't caved when I'm around smokers. To be fair though, I haven't been in situations that I know I will be the most tempted (drug binge). Even when I've encountered frustrating or stressful situations, I just tell myself I will not resort to nicotine to deal with it today.

Is this what AA means when they say "one day at a time?" Or do they say that they're never going to drink again (or at least try to)? I really do believe that my refusal to make it official has sidestepped my usual spiteful, contrarian nature. Hopefully this helps someone and doesn't fuck anyone up. Cheers to everyone who's been at it.

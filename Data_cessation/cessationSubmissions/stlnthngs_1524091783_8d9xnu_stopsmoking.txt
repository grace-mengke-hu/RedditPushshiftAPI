The smoking dream

7 days in and I had my first smoking dream last night. Sitting in the backyard with a giant cigarette, not a 100 but like a 300! It was Cartoonishly massive. I smoked the whole thing unconsciously and while putting it out thinking, "WTF did I just do! Now I have to reset my counter! Gahhh!!" I was so angry at myself, Then I woke up. I realized I didn't really smoke it, did a success kid, took a deep breath, checked my counter app and went back to sleep. It was such a relief to know I didn't actually do it. 

Strange dream for sure. I'm sure they are common, anybody else have a funny smoking dream.

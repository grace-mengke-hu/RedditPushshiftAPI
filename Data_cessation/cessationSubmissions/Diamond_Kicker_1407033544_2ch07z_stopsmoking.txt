What a strange little moment in time

I was hanging out with a friend of mine – a smoker – and we were just hanging out eating a sub. While I opened up my frappucino he pulled a joint outta nowhere and a cigarette, he laid the cigarette down next to me and smoked the blunt. 

I remember looking at the cigarette and wondering what exactly about it was compelling to me. It was like I got the urge but the situation was so strange that I couldn't quite make sense of what was happening. Half of me was so confused about why my friend laid the cigarette next to me that I didn't act on the urge (I didn't even recognize it as an urge) and just kept eating while my friend smoked the joint. Eventually he got the cigarette too but by then I was still confused but happily aware that I didn't even really think about lighting it up...it was a strange moment in time but one in which the decision the "past me" took feels me with joy and relief.

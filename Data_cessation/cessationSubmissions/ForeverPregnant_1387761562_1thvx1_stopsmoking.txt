I lose. Thirteen days smoke free and I'm having one right now.

I had quit cold turkey and I broke down after a petty fight with my mother. It seems that I simply can't handle confrontation of any kind. I'll be back on the quit-wagon tomorrow. Any advice for dealing with sticky situations while on edge from quitting?

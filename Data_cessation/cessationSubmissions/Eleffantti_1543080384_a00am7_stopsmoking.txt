First day here!

Hi!

Today is a first day of trying to quit smoking and it is horrible. I have been trying several times and im not heavy smoker but still my heart is having own party and lungs are feeling pressure and i need to take really deeb breaths. Is this all normal? Not getting air without cigarettes and heart having own party? Also mood swings ingluded.

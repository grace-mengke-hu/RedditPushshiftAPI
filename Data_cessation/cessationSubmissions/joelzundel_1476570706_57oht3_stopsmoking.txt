Back to zero after 679 days. Don't ever put your guard down.

I've had a rough day after a big party. Alcohol is the devil. I can not believe how easy it is to fall into the same trap again. It was hookah just this one time, then just this cig with your mates, then just this pack pack for the weekend.... 

Our brains work against us, but we are stronger. Here's to everyone who's struggling right now - don't take this story as a discouragment, you can quit and it's amazing when you do. Just stay vigilant, always. Nicotine is a drug, if you had a habit then you have to quit for good, don't pay attention to people who boast about smoking one a month.. It all ends with this. Anyways, I reek like an ashtray and I will go to sleep in shame. Have a good day and stay strong.

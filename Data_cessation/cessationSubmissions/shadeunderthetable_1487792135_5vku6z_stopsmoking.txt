Checking In

Many attempts... Feel like crap... Want to beat this... Blah blah blah. You know how the story goes. I haven't tried in a while. I've been in pre-quit mode for a few weeks now. Think its time to commit to another attempt. I don't know if my flair is still up from the last time. Guess I'll find out after I post. Not looking for advice or encouragement, just book marking.

Edit: flair is still there, have to change that.

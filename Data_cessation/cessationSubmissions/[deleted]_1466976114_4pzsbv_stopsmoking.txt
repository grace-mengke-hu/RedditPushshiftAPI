When does the "irritability" phase end and how was it for you guys?

Hi! Currently on day 3 and am really wavering because my phase of irritability is having a marked effect on my mood in ways i am not accustomed to. 

While i'm generally a "cool under pressure" (i plan to head *into* disaster areas for my future job) sort of guy i find myself actively frustrated at minor issues currently and am wondering if this is a normal response and if there are any tips for handling the phase.

I'm not really one for much emotional fluctuation in general thus this current period is really...disconcerting and jarring for me.

Any tips would be helpful and greatly appreciated! :D

Does seeing photos of attractive people smoking makes you angry\triggered?

Ever since I stopped smoking, seeing photos of models, actors and celebrities I'm fond of (i.e. find attractive) smoking is a huge trigger for me. I'm angry at them for smoking, jealous because they make it looks so sexy, and kind of crave a smoke for a few minutes :(

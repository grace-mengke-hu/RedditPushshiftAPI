Massive anger. Could it be because I haven't smoked in 2 months?

Hey,

I'm a woman and I tend to have really bad PMS (emotional during my period) but the last two months (that i've spent without a smoke) I have had a few moments of uncontrollable anger during my period (can't stop screaming, hitting and throwing things.) I'm sort of a control freak and losing control like that makes me really scared since i've always been really calm and composed. I've found myself scared of choking my sister, who is the main trigger of my anger. It's getting worse each time I get angry and I can't think of anything else but changing my habit of smoking that could be causing this. Has anyone experienced this kind of behavior at this stage of their quitting quest?

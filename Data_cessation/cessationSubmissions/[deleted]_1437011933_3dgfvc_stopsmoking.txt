Yeah. That's basically how I feel. 

For some f*cked up reason, I have been in the midst of a 72-hour full blow OBSESSION with going back to smoking. 

I have not smoked, but I don't even say that with and pride or positivity, because I still want to smoke even as I write this. 

I feel empty and super nervous. 

I am not trying to whine and complain, just describing my experience. 

In order to give myself something else to focus on, I'll write a brief gratitude list and a brief list of goals moving forward. 

Gratitude
1. Grateful that I did not smoke 
2. Grateful that my wife is understanding and supportive 
3. Grateful that I have a job, a loving and supportive wife, and a home 
4. Grateful that this sub is here for me to use as a tool 

Goals 
1. Establish regular yoga schedule (instead of once or twice every couple of weeks)
2. Establish an actual meditation practice (instead of an entirely theoretical meditation practice, which I've faithfully maintained for years now!)
3. Get better sleep 
4. Improve diet (this one ain't happening any time soon, as I am definitely using food as a way to manage these intense cravings right now)

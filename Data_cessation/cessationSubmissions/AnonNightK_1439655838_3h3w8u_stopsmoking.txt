Failed :(

I'm posting here to announce that I have been smoking after two months of being smoke free. Also, I started a new account on reddit (Hence why you might not see my previous posts!)

For around 2 months I went without a cigarette. After using Allen Carr's method, I quit very easily and was frankly astounded at how easy it was, and how happy I was as a non smoker.

On one night, I had a cigarette. I don't know why. I was drinking (although not drunk) and just had the feeling of "need" for nicotine. Whilst I had been drinking throughout the two months, I had never been inclined to smoke, even when heavily inebriated! 

I've been thinking about why... I think that using this sub-reddit was a very good place for me. I was able to discuss my feelings, talk to other redditors about their experiences, help them, boost their confidence - and this helped me. After two months, I stopped posting here. I don't know why. I think, maybe, I felt like I didn't need it anymore. I'd even stopped counting how long it had been! 

I'm here to start again. I've rewatched Allen Carr's video, have started reading his book for the second and started listening to the audiobook. I need to get the point of 'easyway' engrained in my brain. It is such a simple and easy method that seems to slip me when I drink.. But this time I am determined.

Wish me luck! I will be here more!

Crashed & Burned at 36 hours. Could use some help.

As proud as I am of myself for lasting the 36 hours I still feel like a complete piece of garbage. Here's the tldr version of what happened.

* My job was implementing a no smoking on company property policy the first of the year
* Decided to quit and read the Alan Carr book.
* Quit my job on December 31st.
* Decided to quit smoking anyway thinking not working would make it easy.
* Got hired for a new job on January 2nd.
* Quit smoking on January 2nd at 10:30 pm

My new job is a management position at a store.... **that sells cigarettes.**

Yeah so I started my new job this morning for training.

They trained me on using the register. 90% of my customers were buying cigarettes (or maybe it just seemed that way). After 5 hours my boss said, "You can take a break if you want a smoke. Do you smoke?" I said, "Yes I do."

I bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked one. I sat in my car and just cried through the whole cigarette. This is seriously how I started smoking 12 years ago at my very first job.

My first day I worked 10 hours and smoked 3 cigarettes total (haven't had one since I got home.)

I don't see how I can work somewhere that sells cigarettes where I can only take a break if I smoke. Any ideas?

Right now my plan is to look for a different job anywhere that doesn't sell cigarettes.

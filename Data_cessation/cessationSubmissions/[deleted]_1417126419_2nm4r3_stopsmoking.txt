My badges are making me realize how stupid I am

As of now, I am on 64 days. This is not smoke free, this is how long I have been smoking for since my last quit. I have not looked at this sub since the day i reset my badge and then continued smoking the day after failing to quit.

I'm sure everyone here has had the phases where they smoke guilt free, thinking that smoking is just important right now and that it is only temporary. That's the phase I was in. But my badge now reads that I've been smoking 2 months since I decided I would quit and it's obviously not temporary. 

How many days have to pass before you realize enough is enough? Maybe 65? I hope I find the motivation soon to actually stop, it will be a depressing day when I return and there is a big fat 365 days here

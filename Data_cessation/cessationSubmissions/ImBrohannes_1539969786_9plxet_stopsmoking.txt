Accountability Buddy

My last and most successful “quit” came when I lived with a friend who was also quitting. We stuck to each other like glue. I can’t do that right now, but I sure can respond to a call or text pretty much any time. I’m looking for someone who is quitting and who is down to talk through my cravings—knowing that I will do the same thing for them. Message me if interested, and good luck to everyone.

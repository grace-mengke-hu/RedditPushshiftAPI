I tried smoking one cigarette after about 4 years

So long story short i quit smoking for about 4 years or so now. The other day I finished watching this amazing series on hbo called Chernobyl where fucking every character you came across smoked a cigarette and it got me really pumped to try it out at least one time to see how it felt to hold a cigarette and smoke again. And so I went and bought myself just one cigarette from the grocery store (where I live you can actually buy individual cigarettes instead of a pack if you want) and tried it out and it felt... TERRIBLE. It felt like the smoke was tearing its way into my lungs and after about two or three rather painful inhalations i forcefully stubbed the cigarette with a grimace on my face and felt dizzy afterwards for a brief moment. The physiological damage of the carcinogenic poison I was introducing to my body was one thing, the real harm was more psychological I guess. I felt like I betrayed my family at that god-awful moment, whom I proudly told for years now that I gave up smoking for good and would never so much as touch a cigarette again in my remaining life. What would they think if they find out I smoked again?!

I want this to be and I'll treat it as a learning opportunity and Ill never smoke again.

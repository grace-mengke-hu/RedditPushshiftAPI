Today is Day 365

I feel like I should have something more profound to say about the experience. 
On this day last year, I ran out of cigarettes and decided not to buy anymore. I had thought about quitting for literal years before actually doing it. 
For New Years I bought myself a 3-pack of Nicorette mini lozenges because I felt that 2013 was going to be the year I finally quit. 
But I put those lozenges away as soon as they arrived in the mail on January 4 (thanks amazon prime).
I didn't pick those lozenges up until April 1. 
I was afraid of becoming depended  upon them so I didn't read the instructions either (pro-tip: don't chew up Nicorette lozenges like they're Altoids. Wow did that make my heart race!)

And the first month was the hardest. I never finished using up the whole 3-pack of lozenges as I never really enjoyed them so giving them up was easier. 
and I still have days where I have to talk myself out of indulging in a random cigarette craving here or there. 
But man. Day 365 feels cool. 
Thanks to you guys for being a constant motivation for me to keep going!

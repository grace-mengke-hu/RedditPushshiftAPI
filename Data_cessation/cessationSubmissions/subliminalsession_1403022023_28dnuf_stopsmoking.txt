i feel like giving up today

i know i can't, and i'm too stubborn so i probably won't this early, but this is the worst i've felt so far. angry at everything, every five minutes, fidgety, restless, irritable, self-conscious... how do i stop feeling this way? i've cleaned the entire house and all i can think about is cigarettes: "did the person who made this lampshade smoke cigarettes?" ITS DRIVING ME CRAZY

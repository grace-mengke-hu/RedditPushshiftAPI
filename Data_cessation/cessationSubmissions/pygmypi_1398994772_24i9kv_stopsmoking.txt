I need to quit smoking. My brothers pregnet girlfriend is still smoking and I feel I can't say anything without first leading by example. Please help, I need help.

I've been smoking for 8 years now and can only feel it getting worse. I used to summit 10,000 ft mountain peaks and now can only run 50 yards. I found out I was going to be an uncle about 4 weeks ago and I sit on the couch feeling like a hypocrite if I say something, but I want to see this child born healthy. What's the first step? 


*Edit 1: You know what happened last night guys! I guess in a way I took that 'first' step. I told her how I was feeling pretty low and how smoking was that last thing to quit for me and she said she means no harm but felt powerless to quit on her own. So... I told her that I would be there for her like I hope to be an uncle to look up to. I now have my brother on board and I just got through my morning coffee without a puff. Wish us luck. 
Also, I am making my way through Allen Carr's book, but it is a can of worms with me when it comes to topics like this for me, so excuse my opinion while I digest and finish the whole book. 
THANKS GUYS!

*Edit 2: formatting

Update: 2 days through and this sucks but I just tell myself I need to become the best person I can be. I really want to be a role model for this kid. Brother's SO slipped and had two today, but for some reason watching her has become unbearable.

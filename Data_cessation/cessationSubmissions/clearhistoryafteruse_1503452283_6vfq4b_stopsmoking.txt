Drank way too much, lit a cigarette, and not sure if I inhaled. Am I hung over or starting over?

I do not intend to take another puff or "cheat" in any way. I drank a shitton of tequila last night and bummed a cigarette. I didn't want to be awkward, so i lit it and then immediately threw it away when I got further away from the person who gave it to me. Am I screwed? I literally cannot afford to get cigarettes or anything to assist in coping with their absence

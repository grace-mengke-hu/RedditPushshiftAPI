Badge reset please and a quick question

Hi all,

I was doing well for so long until my husband and I took a trip to New Orleans back in March.  In case you didn't know, there are many bars you can smoke in New Orleans, so we thought we would just smoke on our vacation.  Wrong.  After several half hearted attempts to quit again, I think this last time has finally stuck.  I haven't had a cigarette for 20 days now and have had minimal cravings.  I now know that I can never, ever again have "just one" because it always turns into full on smoking again.  
My question is, has anyone else experience depression when quitting?  I'm using the nicotine patches (which really does help me taper my addiction to nicotine) and just stepped down to the 14 mg patches yesterday.  I was just so depressed and blah all day.  Everything else is going well in my life, so I can't imagine what else it could be.  It's happened to me before so I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.  
Here's to 20 days of being smoke free and a lifetime of better choices regarding nicotine!

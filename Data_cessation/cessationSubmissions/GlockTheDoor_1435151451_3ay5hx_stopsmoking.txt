Day one, here goes!

I've been smoking cigarettes for about 5 years, and it needs to stop. I installed the stop smoking app, and I purchased Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. I've tried quitting in the past with no luck. Any tips? This sub seems very supportive, and I'm hoping this will assist me in quitting. Let's do this!

2nd and LAST reset

I ended up going down the proverbial "just one more" rabbit hole. I know, I know, not even one. My first attempt was 9 days strong and I honestly didn't even want it THAT much, I just did it, really thinking it was just one. Now I know how stupid and and unrealistic that is. 

Anyway, here's to staying strong this time and not ever going back. Here's to escaping the prison that is cigarettes and here's to a healthy and better life! 

I need to keep coming back here from now on to keep myself motivated, it really does help. Thanks everyone who posts, reads, comments and cares.

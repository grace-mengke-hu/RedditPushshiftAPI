I've been happily smoke-free for about 2 months. Yesterday I smoked weed and I don't know how to feel about this.

The title says it already. I've to note that I live in Europe, where Weed is almost always smoked mixed with tobacco. 

I still feel smoke-free, but I know that yesterday I gave in. I didn't do it only for getting high, but also for nicotine. 

Still - I don't want to smoke right now, and I don't want to smoke in future. Especially when I am drunk. 


How do you quitters handle the marijuana topic? Thank you all!

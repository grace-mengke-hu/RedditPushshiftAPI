Stopping Champix early?

I am curious to see if anyone has stopped Champix quite early after stopping? 
I am only 4 weeks in and day 10s not smoking but as I have to take them with 2 x pieces of bread (4 total, much more carbs than I’m used to) to avoid being sick I’m getting quite worried about weight gain if I have to do it for 12 weeks. I already don’t take them on the weekend as I have to have both by 1pm to be able to sleep, but I’m not a big breakfast person in the morning so it just doesn’t work. 

I definitely will if I have to and then address any weight changes. But would love to hear if anyone successfully stopped early, and how early did you stop?

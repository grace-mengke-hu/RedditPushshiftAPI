Then one day, I just stopped wanting them.

Yup, count me in the masses as one who read Allen Carr. Fuckin' brainwashed me and I'm so thankful for it.

I woke up one morning and just... didn't want one anymore. 

I'm only 8 days in, but right now, at this moment, the thought of smoking is laughable.

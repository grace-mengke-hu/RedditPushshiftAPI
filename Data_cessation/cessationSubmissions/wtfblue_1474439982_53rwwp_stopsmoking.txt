30-day Check In!

Sitting on my lunch break (yay 3rd shift) catching up on SmokeFree missions and was instructed to share my progress!

This is the 2nd longest I've gone without cigarettes in 8 years since I started smoking at 18. I had gone 2 months smoke-free about 10-12 months ago but relapsed during a stressful few weeks in my life and didn't really make an honest attempt to quit again until probably 3 months ago.

I asked my doctor to prescribe Chantix since my willpower alone wasn't hacking it. I would make it maybe a day tops before buying another pack, and then literally hate myself for caving in, feeding the vicious cycle of stress and anxiety I'd been in for months. Chantix was really helpful and I only took it for about 3 weeks. I bought 2 packs after my original quit date (I think August 1?) and my blocked nicotine receptors helped me to really realize what I was doing to myself and why. So, 30 days ago I smoked my last cigarette, and ceremoniously bought the pro version of Smoke Free as a "last pack of cigarettes," and a way of reminding myself not one puff ever again.

Anyway, thanks for reading! Keep fighting the good fight. :)

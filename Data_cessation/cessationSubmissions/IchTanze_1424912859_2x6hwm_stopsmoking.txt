Smoking was my crutch, till my doctor told me I have hypertension yesterday. I'm 24. (24 hours)

I'm a big fan of /r/leaves, so I'm happy to find this.

I'm almost 2 years sober from weed/booze, but it doesn't even feel like that big of a deal, due to my half a pack habit.

Well... doc told me I have hypertension. So my crutch is knocked out.

Just curious how many sober drunkies/stoners are in my same situation, and what you did to continue your non-smoking.

I'm excited, my life is ahead of me, and cancer/heart attack/stroke doesn't have to be apart of my story. 24 hours and I feel on top of the world. Just a little winded.

Thanks.

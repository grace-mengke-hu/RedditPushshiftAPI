Day 5 cravings, first time poster.

Hi everyone, former lurker, new ex-smoker.

I've been going through a pack a day of Camel Crush Menthol for the majority of the last 7 years. 

I'd quit occasionally before but recently I started looking at myself and being really unhappy with my lifestyle. I made a lot of changes but something was still bugging me, then I realized it was the smoking.

 I half-remembered how it felt to not wake up with that ashtray-mouth sensation. I vaguely recalled memories of being able to ride my bike miles and miles without stopping to light a smoke or running out of breath. I decided enough was enough. I cut from a full pack to a half pack, then when I realized that wasn't working, I gave away my last cigarette before my bike ride home Monday morning.


I'm just trying to keep my focus elsewhere and remind myself that I'll be happier as a non-smoker. I have been using a non-medicated menthol 'inhaler', basically a plastic tube that you sniff, to help with my cravings. I'm also keeping a mantra of one is many. If I let myself have one, I'll let myself have another twenty, another hundred, another thousand, another seven-thousand. 

Anyway. I was lurking here for a few weeks before the jump. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who keeps coming here to share your stories and encouragement.

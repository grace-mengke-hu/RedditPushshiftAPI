Closing on day 4.

Every second still seems like an hour. I'm on edge, there's moments when I'm like wow, I'm a non smoker this isn't so bad, I can do this, then in the next thought I'm in a manic panic that I want to smoke so bad, but I can't give up. I enjoy all your post guys. Let's beat this addiction.

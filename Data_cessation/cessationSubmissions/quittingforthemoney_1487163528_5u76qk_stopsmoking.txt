Paying it Forward

Afternoon all,

So I'm 2 1/2 months in, and feeling absolutely fantastic. I genuinely only think about smoking every couple of days, in an "oh yeah, surely I should be thinking about this more?" sort of way, then quickly forget again.

In my first few weeks I was on here constantly, but haven't been on for a while, so I wanted to come back and share some of the kinds of thoughts and benefits I was devouring at the start:

- The biggest immediate benefit for me was the cash boost. I set up a bank transfer for my weekly cigarette spend to go into a different account, with the aim of building a PC with the funds. Having a tangible goal helped immeasurably, and now rather than burning my money away for no benefit, I have a new computer! (I try not to think about the Â£20k I have already wasted on it and I'm only 26...)
- This brings me on to another fantastic benefit: the sheer amount of time spent smoking. In my 73 days I would have spent 3 days, 19 hours literally just standing there smoking. Excluding the additional days I've added to the end of my life, in 2 and a half months I have literally gained nearly 4 days.... scary thought.
- Energy levels are through the roof. The best example is that I used to be extremely lethargic when waking up in the morning. I still don't like getting up, but I don't resent the thought
- Off the back of this - sex is better! Genuinely, fantastic, and probably the benefit which will help most to guard against complacency. 
- I'm getting praise at work for all the extra things I'm getting done
- I genuinely can't express the feeling of how less stressed I am. Not having to worry about whether I've got enough, whether I'll have the time to have a quick one before meetings/shows/going out/whatever, how long it's been since the last one, etc. These things took a subtle yet drastic toll on my mental capacity without me even realising it, but now they're gone the feeling is... well the only way I can describe it is that I'm happier. The removal of these hidden stressors has had a direct impact on my happiness.
- I have not been ill all winter. This has literally never been the case since I quit.

I won't lie, I still have the occasional itch, sometimes worse than others, but now the only danger is to think I'll be alright just having one - THAT'S NEVER OK.

To those starting out - IT GETS SO MUCH EASIER!!!!
To those carrying on - ISN'T THIS AMAZING?!?!

Peace

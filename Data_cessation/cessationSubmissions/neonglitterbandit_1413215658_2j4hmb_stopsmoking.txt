Bride-to-be quitting smoking for GOOD :)

Hi everyone,

New to the sub here, and new 'quitter'! I am 24 and have smoked since I was 18. I originally was a social smoker only and would smoke when I drank, but over time it ended up getting worse. Some of my family members and best friends smoke, and it was hard to turn down a cigarette when I was with them even when I didn't really crave them.

During this time, I met a man and fell madly in love with him. I never hid that I smoked from him, until one day he told me he hated smokers because smoking caused the lung cancer that killed his father a few years prior. I started 'sneaking' cigarettes and trying to hide that I smoked from him. This was almost 6 years ago, and my 'hiding' continued and got worse. He knew that I smoked on occasion, but he never really knew how heavy of a smoker I was. He and I are getting married in a few months, and I know he does not want to marry a smoker. 

Reddit, I am tired of sneaking around. I don't want my fiance to marry a smoker either. He has already lost one person he loves to smoking, and I don't want him to go through that again. I have been cutting down my smoking since moving a few months ago, and decided to ditch my 'emergency pack' and smoked my last cigarette last Wednesday. 

I got an e-cigarette that I like to hold in my hand while I drive (which is my 'trigger'). I haven't really gone through any nicotine withdrawals or had any big cravings, shockingly. One of my biggest concerns is that I take a medicine that makes my cravings go INSANE the first hour I take it, but I feel like even that has subdued since I stopped a few days ago. I am also trying to lose weight for my wedding, and I am a big runner (yes, running and smoking..how has my heart not exploded yet??). I hope that by quitting smoking I can get into the best shape in my life once and for all.

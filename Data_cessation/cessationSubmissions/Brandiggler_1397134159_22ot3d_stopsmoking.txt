55 hours into my quit

I've noticed my heart isn't racing all the time. Breathing has been easier. I've been eating more. Haven't had a BM since the quit, a little odd. (55 hours). Overwhelming feeling of uncertainty about the decision as my addiction is trying to trick me like an ex saying anything they can to keep you from leaving. My sleep has been smoother and I have more energy at work which is strange because I always thought the cigarettes were keeping me up but it turns out that's not the case. Just thought I'd write this to get it out of me because I haven't announced it to anyone in my life. Best of luck, friends.

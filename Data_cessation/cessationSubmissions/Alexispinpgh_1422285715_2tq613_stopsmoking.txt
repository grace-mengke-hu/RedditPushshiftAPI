Day3 is gonna be tough...

Haven't smoked since Friday night. Woke up this morning and my chest hurt like I smoked a pack in my sleep, I'm guessing this is fairly normal from what I've read here. My main concern is that I have the biggest job interview of my life this afternoon and I don't know how I'm going to get through being nervous without smoking. Somehow I'm just going to have to power through!

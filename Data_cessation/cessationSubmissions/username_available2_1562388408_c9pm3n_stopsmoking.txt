Tomorrow is Day 1

Okay guys i may be in a different boat then some of you. I’m only 18 and am addicted to nicotine from vaping. I know, I’m really stupid for starting to vape without smoking. Now I’m out of high school and realized how shitty this is for me and how badly my life is being affected. I just threw away all my stuff (juul, disposables) and am getting off of this addiction. I know i can do this and i know i need to so i can be successful in university which I’m starting in the fall. I have been a slave to this shit for too long, and I’m taking my life back into my own hands. I wish everyone luck on your journey quitting cigs/nicotine. We got this guys. Stay positive

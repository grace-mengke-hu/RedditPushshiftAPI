I can’t believe how far I’ve come. I was a smoker for 31 yrs and one day I woke up and said “I’m done wasting my money &amp; jeopardizing my health”. So I went cold turkey &amp; I will admit it wasn’t easy at first, But I will never go back to smoking. If I can do it so can you. Stay focused everyone

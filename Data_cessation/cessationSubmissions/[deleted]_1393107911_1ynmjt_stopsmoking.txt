Failed after 13 days

Just reset my badge, was feeling down about my relationship and went out to CVS and bought a pack of camel menthols. It sucked. It tasted like shit and all I have nothing to show for it except the loss of my progress. 

If you're thinking about having another smoke guys, don't fucking do it. It's downright depressing having to start all over again.

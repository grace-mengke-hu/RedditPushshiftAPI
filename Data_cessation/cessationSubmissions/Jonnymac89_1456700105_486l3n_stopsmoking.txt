I made it to 100 days!

It feels good man. 100 days came and went and I didn't even notice. Smoking is not even a noticeable part of my life anymore. It was hard the first month for me, but eventually the cravings stopped and it hasn't been too hard to stay strong since. Keep with it guys! It gets easier.

Bought patches yesterday, had my last smoke at around 11:30PM last night.

Waiting for my badge to be updated. I got pretty drunk last night, in celebration of the solstice, and got woken up by garbage trucks very early this morning... That was the worst of the cravings I've had. I was having trouble going back to sleep, but I decided I wouldn't even get out of bed until the craving passed. I woke up three hours later, feeling fine! I have two large bags of sunflower seeds and a stress cube. The most challenging part for me will be taking my mom to the airport tonight(she smokes in her car) and then spending the day with my dad on Monday. But I can do it!

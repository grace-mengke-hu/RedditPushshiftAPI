I've bored myself to death failing... not this time

been scanning the subreddit and so many incredible tips, tricks and outright truths. Had to post something to say thanks to everyone. Only 3 days so far but this time it feels different.

If nothing else, through 15 years of smoking, I have tried and failed so many times. Girlfriends, family members, mates, they've all been behind me but that never seems to help.  Going at this quietly and softly I(outside of here) but more than anything I'm just sick and tired of letting MYSELF down. Not this time reddit, just going for it. Medium strength patches, avoiding booze and "smoky" situations like pubs and nights out for a few weeks. Some people think that sounds extreme but I feel it's the only way.  The simple truth is that to succeed I just have to not smoke another cigarette.... easy.... right!?

Any other tips for this first week? Cravings come in waves but so far I've replaced them with Capri Sun drinks, and then I chew the straw for hours!

1 month 4 days cold turkey.

Been lurking on this sub for a couple of weeks now and finally decided I should say hi.

I quit just over a month ago and its has been hard. I have been snacking all day everyday at work (the place where I smoked the majority of the time).  The first few weeks were easyish. I had ankle surgery so it made the first week simple. But right now I really want to have a smoke.  

I have had no aids (e-cigs or patch) and wonder what everyone else has done to get past this point.

Thanks everyone.

Withdrawal symptoms

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I gave up the death sticks a week ago now, for the past couple of days I have had some symptoms and wanted to see if anyone else have experienced these!? It almost feels like the muscles in my arms and legs are vibrating and my legs feel really weak when I get up to walk about. Is this normal or should I be concerned?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

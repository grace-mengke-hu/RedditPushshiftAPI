Relapsed after my day one post. Need some tips

I posted a thread a couple days ago but since then I've relapsed. I smoked the last cigarette from my pack about 4 hours ago.

I need some help though. What can I do to take my mind off smoking? I've gotten back into running and I have a pack of gum with me to help. My only concern is I'm a delivery driver and I spend a lot of time in my car. That's when my cravings are most intense.

Edit- also are there any quit smoking apps out there that may help me track how much money I've saved, how long since my last one, etc. I'm on Android.

Trying again

I “quit” on January first. With the help of this subreddit, the patch, and a stop smoking app, I made it longer than I ever had before. But slowly, I started to think just smoking one or two at work would be ok. I was enjoying my freedom from the addiction, and thought I had it beat. I should’ve known better: “just one more” has never ended up being just one more.
I kept my work cigarettes a secret from my friends, my family, and even my app (by “forgetting” to log or acknowledge them.) my ex husband said he was proud of me and my kids were happy I finally had it beat. But the nature of nicotine addiction is that it just grows and grows, you can’t keep it at bay. Soon enough I was “accidentally” bringing my work pack home and spending my nights chain smoking in the backyard again. Back to a pack a day, like nothing had happened.
So I finished a pack on Easter, and fought the urge to buy a new one. I applied a new patch this morning, and on my way to work this morning, briefly thought, “ehh, maybe I’ll just have a quick pre-work smoke.” Instead I drove straight to work. I realize this is more than even a chemical or psychological addiction, at least for me. I don’t like to tell myself no, ever. I work hard and my life is stressful and I use this to justify “rewarding” myself whenever I feel like I deserve it (which is just... too often.) it’s a sick mentality, and I’m committed to exercising self control. I’m going to do this.

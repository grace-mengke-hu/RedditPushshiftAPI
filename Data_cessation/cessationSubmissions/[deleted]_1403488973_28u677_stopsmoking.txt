Day 6. Contemplating e-cigs.

Hey, guys! So, I'm on Day 6, and I've hit a bit of a wall. I quit using the Easyway, which has worked wonders so far. The only issue I'm having, however, is that I miss the actual ritual of smoking. Not the cigarettes, and not the nicotine: just the motion of lifting the cigarette and breathing something in. 

My question is this: If I buy an e-cigarette loaded with nicotine-free vapor, do you think that would be a problem, or damage my effort to quit? I know I'm not supposed to be relying on a "crutch," as it makes the cigarette seem valuable, but maybe this will help? If there's no nicotine, that should be okay, right? 

What do you guys think? 

EDIT: Day 5, apparently. I must be rounding up.

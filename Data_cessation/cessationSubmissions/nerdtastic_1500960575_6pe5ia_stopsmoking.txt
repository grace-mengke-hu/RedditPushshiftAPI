2weeks!Thanks,r/stop smoking

I'll start by saying that I had smoked for more than half my life. I've tried quitting so so so many times before (including using the Alan Carr method) but this time I really feel like it's going to stick. 

I have been vaping as NRT but trying to be mindful and lowering nicotine levels (I'm at 6 mg/3 mg now using two different devices). I've been keeping track of all my spending and still after buying 2 e-cig devices, juice, and other supplies for them - I've still saved money. 

Anyway, I just really wanted to thank this subreddit for being here. Especially during the first few days of being really manic, it helped so much to read through posts of y'all's experiences and words of encouragement. 

I really reached a milestone this weekend when a friend who smoked was over and I didn't even want to ask for a puff. When  I considered it, I could really imagine that heavy dark queasy feeling I would get when smoking after not having one for an extended period of time and just couldn't imagine ever wanting to experience that again.

I'm not deluding myself into thinking I'm in the clear - and I wonder if vaping is keeping my lungs from healing (I've had very little coughing) - or if since I smoked for 24 years it's just going to take a significant amount of time for my cilia to start working again.  But, dang! I feel really good about myself for making it this far and looking forward to the rest of my life free of that toxic relationship!

Sorry for the long winded post! Keep being awesome!

Nicotine withdrawl and insomnia: anybody else dealing with this nightmare?

I'm 35-days now without a cigarette. I used 4mg nicotine gum and 12mg vape the first two weeks. Since then I'm down to practically no gum (one or two pieces a day; 2mg) and 4mg vape. I don't use the e-cig often, by the way.

For the last week or so I've been experiencing awful insomnia. It's the kind where despite your exhaustion you only manage to sleep 30-60mins at a time before waking up and having to toss and turn again for at least an hour before being able to sleep. Then the cycle starts over.

I've been absolutely exhausted the last week or so and have not had a good solid night of sleep in the time. I've tried quitting the gum/vape entirely but that made things worse. I've tried having a piece of gum just before bed thinking my body would be cool with that, but it wasn't. 

It's worth pointing out that I'm on my last box of the gum and that I will not be buying another refill for my vape. I think I'm nearing the end of my dependence on the nicotine but I'm really worried that I have a lot more insomnia to look forward to as a result. I've considered buying some over-the-counter sleeping pills to help me get a full night's rest but I'm not sure if that's wise.

Have any of you gone through anything similar? Thanks for reading and any advice/personal anecdotes are welcome of course.

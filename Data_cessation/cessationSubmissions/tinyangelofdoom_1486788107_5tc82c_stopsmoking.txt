I need help

I was doing really well at quitting smoking. Then my psychiatrist lowered my dose, my insurance lapsed bc I got fired, I got my house broken into and I spilled all my medication In a puddle. I can't afford to get it refilled at the moment and my ew insurance won't kick in for a while. I just bought a pack of cigarettes (so much less than my 160 for new anti depressants I won't even get til Monday) and I smoked. And it feels good but I feel awful. Can I quit now or do I wait til my shit gets handled? I'm so god damn upset

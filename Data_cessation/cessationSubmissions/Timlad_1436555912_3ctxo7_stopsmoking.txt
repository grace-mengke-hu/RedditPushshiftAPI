Resetting my badge after 810(ish) days... Just goes to show that even one puff is enough to draw you back.

I went 2 years without a single puff or even a single inclination to have a cigarette.  One day hanging out with my sister and her bf (who both smoke), drinking of course.  Took one puff and that was all it took.  I'm now smoking about 3-10 a day and have bought maybe 4-5 packs since my relapse.  

I'm in the process of reading Alan Carr's book (The easy way) again, and hopefully I can once again label myself as a happy non-smoker.  

Just goes to show how potent this piece of shit drug is.  Don't be like me, guys.  Stick to your guns, and don't light that cigarette.

TLDR: Goodbye 2 year badge.

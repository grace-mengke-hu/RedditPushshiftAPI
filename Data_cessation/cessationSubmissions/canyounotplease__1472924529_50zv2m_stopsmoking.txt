Day 6, drank a bottle of wine last night... I DIDN'T SMOKE!

It was my first time actually getting drunk since I quit. I had two pretty hearty beers at dinner a few days ago and stopped drinking after I felt myself getting tempted.

Well last night my best friend came over for dinner, she doesn't smoke. I was pretty distant a few times I think, but I managed to fight the urges. I just wanted to tell everyone, I'm really proud of myself!! Not to condone downing a bottle of wine or anything :P but damn it I do enjoy it every now and then. 

You can beat this! I believe in everyone here. We are NOT missing out on anything by quitting cigarettes. We don't have to. I'm really excited, it almost feels like I'm starting a new life, a better one.

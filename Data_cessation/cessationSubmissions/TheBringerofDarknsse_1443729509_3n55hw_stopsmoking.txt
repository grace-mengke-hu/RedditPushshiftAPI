Is this how its going to be forever?

Right now, I haven't had a smoke in 5 days, I'm sitting in my cube, dying. Taking deep breaths and calming myself, resisting the urge to go outside and bum a smoke. I actually went outside, got writhing 4 feet of the smoking area, and turned around and here I am. 

How long will this last..every stressful situation I'm in, is this how my body will react? 

I've tried pills, patches, gum, and now till be trying hypnosis and later possibly a laser treatment. 

It's really bad. I never even was a heavy smoker?!

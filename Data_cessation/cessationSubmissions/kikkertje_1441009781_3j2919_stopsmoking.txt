Here we go again

I quit smoking January 2nd this year and today would've been my 241st day of non-smoking. Unfortunately somewhere during the Summer, with the beers and the fun outside I gave in and smoked a cigarette. Of course I thought I had it under control, but step by step the nicotine got hold of me and about a month ago I was back to full-time smoking, and I felt awful!

Yesterday was may birthday, and I couldn't think of a better birthday present than to never smoke again. I didn't touch a cigarette all day and am at day 2!

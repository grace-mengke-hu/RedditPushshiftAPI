Nearly a week!

With the aid of vaping, I’m approaching the end of a week smoke-free.

I’ve attempted cold turkey quits in the past and have always admired and also held a degree of envy towards people who can do it.

Needless to say, I feel more energetic, my taste is improving and I generally feel happier.  

I had a persistent unproductive cough which has subsided already to my disbelief, I am only occasionally coughing but it’s productive, I do expect this coughing to get worse as my lungs try to clean themselves out.

That then brings me onto the wheezing, I had been consistently wheezing whilst lying down for 3 or 4 months, well guess what, that’s pretty much completely stopped too!  It still flares up when I exercise but I am hoping to see that improve over the coming weeks and months.

I’m annoyed at myself, I was naturally extremely athletic when I was in my
teens, played football (soccer), ran long distance, middle distance, relay races, cross country, did a lot of bicycle riding and played cricket too.

Into my mid 20’s I maintained the football, playing up to 5 times a week until I hit 27/28 when the smoking caught up with me, I tried to quit smoking, but ended up quitting the football instead, what an idiot.

So here I am, 30 years of age, started playing football again and on the road to being smoke-free.

The aim, to reduce from 6mg nicotine e-liquid to 3mg in January, then to go nicotine free by April.  I want to feel a return of fitness and feel the benefit when playing football and any other exercise I may do.  

I know I’ll never fully reverse the damage done but I’m determined to reverse as much of it as possible!

I'm desperate for advice

Hi fellow redditors,

I'm new to reddit entirely, and I want to stop some of my bad habits, one of them in particular being smoking. I live in a country where a pack is 2$ and more than half the population smokes. I've read allen carr's easy way to stop smoking and I quit for a while until I relapsed, now I can't even quit for a day.

I have a lot of personal and family issues, and back then when I quit I used to go to therapy and it might've helped(I think).

Any hard advice on how to stop? I'd appreciate it very much.

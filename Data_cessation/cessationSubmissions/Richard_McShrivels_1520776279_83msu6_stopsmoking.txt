Into day for on NRT.

4mg lozenges.  I had a pretty strong urge to smoke anyway last night but fought it off!  That usually doesn't happen; I'm stoked!  Does stopsmoking not have a daily rant megathread?  It should have one.  I'd probably post 10x more if I wasn't worried about spamming the main page up, but it's nicer to vent where you know an understanding mind might see it.  More so than, say, journaling where nobody'll ever see.

Edit: 'Into day 4 on NRT.' I mistyped.

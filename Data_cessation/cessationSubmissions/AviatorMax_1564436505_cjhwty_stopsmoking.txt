I want to ask what are the best ways to detox your body fast and and which are the best ways to cope with the withdrawals?

Hello,

I have had enough now. I am planning to quit cold turkey from 1st August. I have been smoking for the past 10 years. I have tried stopping a lot of times. The maximum time i could be without smoking was around 3 months. I always found a way to get back to it eventually. Now, i feel like its taking a toll on both my physical and mental health.

I want to get the nicotine out of my system as fast as i can.I hope someone here would be able to show me the path.And this family will keep me accountable in my journey.I need all the help i can get. Desperately.

18M, smoker for 2 years. This is the last "Day 1" I'll have.

"Hey I thought you quit bro" "Yeah well, so and so (insert lame excuse)"

After close a year of half-assed quit attempts my friends don't take me seriously anymore. I didn't take myself seriously either, but that has to change. Right now.

Wow. So I'm going to be a non-smoker for the rest of my life, starting today.

Some of my immediate feelings to this are fear, relief, anxiety, the same mishmash of "oh shit what do I do now" feels. But I think my biggest reaction goes sort of like "that was it?" I've just ended my career as a smoker. With two years of my life and quite a lot of money thrown down this path, I've received *fuck-all*. Seriously, that was it? It was never glamorous or romantic like 1960s movies made it. It never helped me achieve anything that I couldn't already do (and could do better!) as a non-smoker before. In fact, for the past two years I've just been walking around in a nicotine-daze, just thinking about the next cigarette, and the next one... So looking back now on the whole of "that", what meaningful things have I taken with me from this costly addiction? Apart from the skill to pack a cigarette pack, unravel some cellophane and use a lighter, absolutely fucking nothing. Jesus what was I thinking in the first place?

From now on I'm adopting an attitude of treating smoking as something I "just don't do". Like how smoking crack is something I just have no interest in doing, I don't think about it, I don't plan my day around it, I "just don't do" it. And I won't wake up tomorrow thinking "jeez if only..." because I never needed it in the first place.

Special thanks to Allen Carr and this subreddit, you guys rock. 

We are all youngest in our lives today, it's never too late or early to quit.

So I started Zyban one week ago.

I've tried everything to quit, after smoking a pack a day for 7 years. The patches didn't help break the habit, the lozenges and inhalers made me sick, and cold turkey never lasted more then a few days.

I joined a smoking cessation group and got health coverage for 3 months of Zyban, and at first I wasn't even going to fill my prescription, because I didn't feel like using an anti depressant to break an addiction was a good idea.

It's day 7 now, I took 1 pill for 3 days and now 2 for the rest of the 3 months. Total of 300mg.

The pros: This morning I had very little desire to go for a smoke when I woke up, which is my biggest smoking habit, and the smoke I had later this morning didn't really satisfy me at all. Usually by now I've had 4 cigarettes, so far I've only had a half.

The cons: I feel a bit ditzy, I've been really hyper but still physically low energy. I've been fumbling my words a bit, a bit of naseua and dizziness throughout the day, and I do have some insomnia, it's taking about an hour to fall asleep every night.

All in all, I suggest Zyban to the people who've tried everything. I still don't like that I'm on a anti depressant, but I can't ignore the positive results.

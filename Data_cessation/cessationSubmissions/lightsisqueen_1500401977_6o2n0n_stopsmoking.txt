Playing hockey while using nicotine patch

Just started using nicotine patches this week and so far I feel good, I've quit before cold turkey from cigarettes but this time i picked back up dipping as well which turned into cigarettes and made it a lot more tough. My main question is should I take the patch off while I play? I did a bit of digging to find out but couldn't find much. Anyone have any experience or knowledge in this?

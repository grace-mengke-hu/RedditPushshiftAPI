Week 6 and withdrawl pangs have not gone away.

I still feel that empty feeling like I'm on my first week of stopping.
I stopped smoking 6 weeks ago. I found it easy to start but now its very difficult because this has been dragging on for so long. The Allan Carr book would not work for me on this attempt. I used a combination of the book, knowledge I found online and weed. The latter helped, but I see that it's clearly causing me to have depression, which is a battle I thought I'd long ago fought and won. So weed is out from today.
Damn why are these f*****g pangs still haunting me and are still here six weeks after I quit?
I'm not giving up... but when is it all just gonna be normal for me again? 
In the beginning it was easy. Every week (on Friday nights) I've been out clubbing and drinking and never thought of smoking while having fun, but after the weekend was over I would crave cigarettes like crazy. 
Is it the passive smoking in the clubs? Is it alcohol? This is turning from moderately easy to a freaking nightmare. ... when will the cravings end? Help?!

Summer cravings, staying free

I have been noticing that summer is offering some new enticements. Parades and fireworks. A cool beer after work. Work is getting busier. Old friends in town. I had a dream last night that I smoked. Overall it is so freeing to not be a smoker anymore. However, each season brings about old associations. Each association is another opportunity to deprogram some neurological pathways tied to smoking. It has been easier since around 8 weeks. Far easier than I thought it could be. A lot of the time now I don't even think about it. Yet, at times that temptation is still there and old voices start trying to justify a cigarette. I caught my brain telling me, "don't worry, when you hit one year you can have one". Wow!-What a strong addiction. I'm happy to be free! Tonight at an event I also noticed  how it is so wonderful to be sitting by somebody who is smoking and feeling how great it is that I don't feel I have to have a smoke anymore. That's real freedom.

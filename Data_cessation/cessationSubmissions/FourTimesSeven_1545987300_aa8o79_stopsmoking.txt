Need Advice - Going with Family to Mexico, Quit Now or Later?

Hi all! 

I'm addicted to vaping (I use a suorin, which is similar to a juul), and I'm really embarrassed about it. I started smoking cigarettes after a bad break up, and after beginning to mooch my friends' juuls a lot, I ended up buying it myself. I really regret it and want to quit soon, I guess I just haven't found the right "time". For reference, I'm a 20 YO college student.

I'm going down to Mexico with my family tomorrow. We're driving across the border. I'm really worried that my suorin is going to get confiscated at the border, or at least get pulled out and checked. My parents don't know I smoke and would (rightfully) freak out if they did. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm presented with a few options:

1. Bring it anyway, hide it in my bag and hope nobody searches our stuff. Hopefully quit soon. 
2. Don't bring it, and use this as an excuse to start quitting. The reason I'm hesitant to do this is that I know I will be really moody during the first period of nicotine withdrawals, and I don't want to ruin our family vacation. 
3. Purchase nicotine gum/nicotine patches to prevent withdrawals but jumpstart me quitting. To me, this seems like the best option, but I'm only 20 and can't legally buy them in my state. I have a fake ID that I've been using to buy cigs / vape stuff, but I feel like most of the places that I buy from are pretty lenient on IDs and I'm worried my fake wouldn't work at a normal drug store.

Thank you for reading. I would love to hear your advice and support. I feel like an idiot right now for letting myself get into this situation.

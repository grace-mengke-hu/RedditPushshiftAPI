To those who want to quit but like (or love) smoking too much...

STOP TELLING YOURSELF HOW WONDERFUL IT IS!

It's not wonderful

You only like it because youre addicted.

 Have you ever woke up in the middle of night and caught a whiff of the ashtray next to the bed? Thats what smoking tastes like but your brain has convinced you otherwise. Thats also what you tastes and smells like to other people. Having a hard time smelling that? Take a piece of gum, chew the flavor out of it. Then rub it all over the inside of the ashtrat and put it back in your mouth. That's what im talking about. Isnt it great?

How is anybody supposed to stop doing something when they constantly reinforce the positive feelings they get from it? The more bullshit you feed yourself the longer it'll you take to excrete it from your system. Puns intended cause cigarettes taste like shit.

Likewise, after you quit dont sit around grumbling about how much you miss it. I know people who still whine about quitting TWENTY years ago. Twenty years lived in misery because they constantly and repetitively tell themselves how much they wish they still smoked. What good is your health when youre mostly unbearable riding a two decade long nicotine fit?!

 To be mentally addicted to something you havent touched in twenty years is fucking pathetic. :/ 

The only thing stopping your from quitting is yourself.

Struggling

I'm struggling with not smoking. Im having my longest craving (about 1 hour) right now and it is making me crazy. I don't think this craving is as anyone I've had before because those last at most a couple of minutes.
I just want to smoke one cigarette, have a few puffs. I miss it. I feel like I miss a friend. At the same time I don't want to smoke because I'm afraid that's going to make me relapse hard because right now I think that smoking one isnt that big of a deal, I can handle just having one. In the past when I still smoked I used to chain smoke if I had run out of cigarettes the night before. Just because I hadn't had any for about half a day.

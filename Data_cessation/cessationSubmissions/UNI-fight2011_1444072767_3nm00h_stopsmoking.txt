What are you using if you're trying to quit? What worked if you've had success?

Hey everyone,

I wanted to start a conversation about what everyone is using to quit these days? I understand that everyone is different, but I thought it would be good for everyone to see. And if you've been able to quit, what was it that finally helped you?

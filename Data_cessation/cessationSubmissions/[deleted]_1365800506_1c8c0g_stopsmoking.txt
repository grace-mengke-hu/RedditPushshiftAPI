Day 2 TERRIBLE timing

Have tried quitting countless times over the past four years and relapsed each and every time as an almost  pack a day smoker. Decided that my 21st cakeday was the last day for smoking with no exceptions. I thought that I would be able to start strong (especially after only smoking electronic cigarettes the past two weeks). WRONG

Past 16 hours have been bad headaches, cramps, and inability to concentrate. I'm hosting a party at my house for my birthday tonight. How terrible of a host would I be to not drink even though its a party I'm hosting for my birthday? Any tips for diminishing these symptoms? Thanks guys.

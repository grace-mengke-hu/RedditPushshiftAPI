6-0-0!

Yay ! 600 days without smoking after 10 years, ending at 1 pack a day!

 I'm doing fine, I don't crave cigarettes at all, even though I may think of them every once in a while!

Seeing other people smoke makes me so proud I quit!

I remain vigilent, but I'm totally cool now, and it doesn't require energy to remain smokeless :)

Kudos to starters and veterans! This sub is awesome!

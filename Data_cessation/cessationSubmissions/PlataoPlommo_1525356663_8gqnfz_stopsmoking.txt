Quit smoking, loss of libidio/interest in sex. Have trouble with sensitivity though

Okay, I wasn't really sure how to phrase my question so I'll refrain from too much info, but explain further.

Since I've quit smoking (10 days ago), I experience loss of libido for quiet sometime. Also, if I do start having sex/masturbating, I have a really fucking tough time cumming.

My question is; is this normal? Can anyone explain to me what is going on? Does anyone else have it this way?

I am mid 20's, fairly active, and such. It's not my first time trying to quit smoking, and this always happens.

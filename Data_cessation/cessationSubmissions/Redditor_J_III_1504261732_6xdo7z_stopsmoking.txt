Need advice on Cold Turkey v. Lozenges?

I'd like to hear some of your thoughts on quitting cold turkey vs. using nicotine lozenges?  I'm trying ...yet again... on lozenges and am not sure if I can overcome the first strong urge to spit it out and smoke that comes along.  Is it better to wean off nicotine slowly or just cut it off immediately and power through it?  Ignore my badge btw, It's day one again.

Edit:  Thanks guys!  Yeah, I think I'm going to stick with the lozenges.  A -do- seem to have a lot of them laying around the house, so I'll coast on these for a while and postpone the hard part until further down the road.  I appreciate the input and to you cold-turkey quitters, I salute and envy your inner strength!

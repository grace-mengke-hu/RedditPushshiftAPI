End of day 3!

From what I remember and read, day 3 is the worst, but I'm pretty determined and my mind is set on living smoke free plus I'm proud of myself being able to keep posting these at the end of each day and going to sleep smoke free and waking up with so much more energy!

Going to start working out again very soon. Need to reallocate all this excess energy.

Starting my journey towards being smoke-free

I'm 22 yo and have been smoking for about 6 years now. I've been trying to quit smoking for the past year; I tried patches, gum, e-cigs, etc., and none of it has worked. Call it weak will power, but whatever, I'm actively trying.
Recently I visited my doctor and talked to him about it, really emphasizing how important it is to me to quit. He gave me a prescription for Bupropion - which is actually an anti-depressant that's shown signs for smoking cessation - and I love it! I went from smoking 20 or more cigs a day down to 4 a day in the first week! 
I'm so ecstatic and hopeful, and I just wanted to thank you guys. Your stories have been a big inspiration and have helped me stay motivated through all this.

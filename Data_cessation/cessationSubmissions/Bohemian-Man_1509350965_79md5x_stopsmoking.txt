Without cig I feel I am missing some extreme fun :D

That is my prevalent feeling last 6 days since my last cigarette.
I am doing just the same things I did when I smoked. I am at the same places I was. Yet, I have a constant feeling that I am missing something very funny and entertaining! :D 
I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms, no cravings for cig but that constant thought of missing something is a killer :)

I don't get as sick as I used after quitting. Anyone else notice this?

Has anybody else noticed this?  I got a 5yo, so I'm constantly catching cold and flu bugs from her.  

Before I quit, if I caught a cold it would last weeks and then I would have a cough for weeks after that.  Over the last 8mo's though I've had two colds and they just lasted a few days, with no cough after.

Has anyone else had this experience or is it just me?

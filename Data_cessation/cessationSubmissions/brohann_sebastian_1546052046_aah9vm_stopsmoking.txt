It's been two weeks.

It's been two weeks and I'm having the strongest craving yet. There's so much going on in my mind. It feels like there's a void I cannot fill. It's like I'm hungry, but I know I'm not hungry; like I'm thirsty, but I know I'm not thirsty. I am feeling angry and depressed. I thought cravings were supposed to end within a few minutes? This is intense and it's been eating me for the past two hours. I've gone on a walk and played video games and it's still eating me. Any advice?

Unbelievably persistent cough?

Hi everyone! 
I started quitting a couple months ago after lurking on this subreddit quite a bit. I was doing great for almost three weeks, relapsed, went another week, relapsed, went a few days, relapsed. All drinking related (anyone else noticing a trend here?)

Anyway this is maybe attempt number 5 and my second most successful one at about a week now. Feeling good about this one. I've read Allen Carrs easy way and I'm currently reading Freedom From Nicotine which is helping a bit.

The cool thing is that each time I attempt to quit it gets easier, mainly the first few days. However one thing that is really motivating me now is I have the most rattling, awful, persistent cough that started after I got sick immediately after fail number 1. It's probably persisted about 5 weeks now. Usually I cough up a bunch of mucus but sometimes it's a dry cough. Sometimes I can't catch my breath.

Any insight on to why this is happening, when and if it will stop, and if I should see a doctor? Is it the stress on my lungs from starting and resetting the healing process so many times? Should I be concerned about something more serious? I smoked for ten years. Anyway any advice/wisdom would be greatly appreciated! 

Also on a side note if you're on this subreddit that means that you DO NOT want to be a smoker anymore (or just don't know yet that you don't want to be a smoker anymore) and that is AWESOME. Admitting to addiction really is the first step! Good on you and God speed!

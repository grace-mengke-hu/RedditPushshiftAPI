I fell down but I'm picking myself up

So after 5 days of not smoking, I fell. I bought a pack before work and smoked about 6 of the cigarettes. After work though, I took one last cigarette and threw the pack away. It was a waste of money when the pack was more than half full, sure, but it felt great to throw it out. Sadly this means it's a new day 1 but I'm gonna stick to it. It is/was a bad habit to smoke at work but I'm done with that now. 

To be honest, those 6 cigarettes didn't feel or taste good at all. I learned a lesson and that is that it's greater to just not smoke at all. 

I'm also curious: In those 5 days after quitting I suddenly woke up with a bit of a sore throat and a running nose. I think I've heard somewhere that it can be a side-effect of quitting smoking but I just wanted to be sure.

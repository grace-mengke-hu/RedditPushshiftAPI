2 years of smoking a half pack a day and now I'm finally kicking it

Hi guys, I'm new! Just wanted to say I've been a lurker for 4 months now, although only has been 2 years since I started, its been a dreadful 2 years. I started smoking because of my ex-gf and being in medical school, I think its time to quit :) Wishing everyone a great week! 

PS I am addicted to running now, anyone else have a success story from smoking to being a marathon runner or triathlete they would be willing to share :)

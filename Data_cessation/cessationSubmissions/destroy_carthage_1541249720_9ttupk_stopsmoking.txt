Any good ways of tracking how long you’ve quit for?

I quit three weeks ago today and while I know it’s not been for that long I’m still going well. However I would kill for a cigarette right now, something that I think will help would be to keep track of how many days it’s been so that I can use that to motivate me. Therefore my question is what good methods are there for keeping track of how long you’ve quit?

Thanks in advance.

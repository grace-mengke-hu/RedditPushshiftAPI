Day 5 interesting self finding

So tonight I stopped by a drug store to pick up some foundation before heading home and there was a woman in front of me, who was on the phone.  The first thing I noticed how raspy her voice was and then it hit me, the smell and I thought to myself, OMG I used to smell like that.  I am not looking down my nose at her as to each their own, but OMG, I hate the thought that I used to smell like that.  

On another note, I only had 2 cravings today and was able to combat both of them, so yay me. :)

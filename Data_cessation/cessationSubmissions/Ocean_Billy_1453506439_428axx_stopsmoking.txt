Just bought my last pack.

I've wanted to quit for awhile now. Cigarettes are no longer enjoyable and I'm just flushing money down the toilet at this point. So I've decided to try quitting (again). I decided that the pack I bought today is my last one I'm going to buy. Hopefully ill make it this time, really tired of smelling like an ashtray!

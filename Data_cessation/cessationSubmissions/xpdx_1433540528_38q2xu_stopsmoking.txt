Re-Quitting Again Again.

This is the third or fourth time I've quit. My longest quit was 2.5 years. I picked it up again about a year ago. I'm on my third day now. So far it's scary how easy it is- a few small cravings but nothing too bad- just if I dwell on it it bothers me. I think being smoke free for those two and half years really helps now- knowing how easy it is after a few weeks and how good I felt really makes a difference. 


If this is your first time- it gets soooooooo much better than you think it will. Really. It's like magic how good you'll feel after a couple of weeks.

 Stay strong! It's totally worth it.

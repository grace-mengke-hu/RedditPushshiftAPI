I'm a social smoker. Tonight, I'm gonna stop.

I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead. I wouldn't say I'm hooked yet, but whenever I get presented with the opportunity, I never say no to a cigarette. 

From here on out, I'm turning that shit down. I wanna be able to say "no" before I get properly addicted.

This post is my commitment. Tomorrow, I'm gonna talk to my dad about it. He used to smoke, but quit before I was born. I'm gonna ask him for advice. I'll ask him what he wish he had done in my situation. 

Sorry for ranting, need to get it out there.

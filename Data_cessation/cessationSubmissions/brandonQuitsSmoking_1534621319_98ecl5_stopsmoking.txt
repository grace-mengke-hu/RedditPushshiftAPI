I've owned four Juuls

and they did not help me quit. For a while I'd be able to get my nicotine fix from them, but being able to use them inside let me use them constantly, and that only made me more dependent on nicotine. Every time I gave away or threw out a juul, I just went straight back to smoking, and I needed more cigarettes a day than when I "switched". Quitting is hell and drawing it out is making it worse.

I'm going cold turkey starting today. Wish me luck lads.

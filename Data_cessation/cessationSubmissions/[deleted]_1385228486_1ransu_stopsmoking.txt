You got me through my darkest time, who wants to bask in the glorious glow of my Star badge?

I just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for the amazing support!

I really struggled emotionally in the first few days, and you guys made *such* a difference for me

First minutes, then hours, then days, now the weeks are rolling by....

I'm *so* glad I kicked cigarettes to the curb, after 20 years in prison

**I've never felt so free!**

Thank you /r/stopsmoking!

(Those of you who came to bask in that glorious glow, you'll find my starry badge of awesomeness just next to my username... no jostling, plenty of awesome for everyone)

Any lurkers - you can do it!!

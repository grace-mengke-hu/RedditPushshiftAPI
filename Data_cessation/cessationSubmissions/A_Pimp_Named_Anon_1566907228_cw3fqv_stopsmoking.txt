Today is day number 6 completely Nicotine free.

Like I said before day number 6. I feel great, I’m way more motivated, I can smell and breath better. The cravings are almost never there. It’s amazing. The only problem is I can’t decide if I should stay nicotine free and just thug it out so to speak. Or go to patches. I kind of feel like it’s cheating and I’m already so far into quitting why bother? On the other hand though.. Idk just kind of battling.

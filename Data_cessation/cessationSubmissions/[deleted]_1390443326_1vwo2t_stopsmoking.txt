Quitting Friday. 5 years to the day & I'm 21. It's going to be hard for me.

....but I'm ready, excited, scared & psyched for it.

I'm going to use the patch. I'm also going to get a vapor pen with 2mg (less than 10% of the standard nicotine dosage) for situations where I really want to smoke - I'll throw that away after one week.

I'm glad to have this community to share the experience with and would greatly appreciate any advice specific to my situation:

> I smoke pot & think it'll be a good "vice". I smoke medically so quitting is not an option at this point.
> I drink a 6 pack a night consistently, I'm going to cut that back, but again I probably won't quit because I'd like to have it as stress relief / a reward after not smoking all day.
> I work too much & am often stressed out to begin with. I need to find a way to relax at work. Obviously walks are the most obvious option. I'm also thinking I'll bring gum & a few choices of something to drink (not talking alcohol obviously, hah).

Thanks again everyone & cheers to a better life!

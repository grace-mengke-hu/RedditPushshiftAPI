Smoked my Last Cigarette Last Night.

This will be my second time quitting and it has got to be the easiest by far. I read Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking out of curiosity and words can not describe how spot on it was explaining why we smoke and also spot on on why we DON'T NEED to smoke without reverting to scare tactics. Last night instead of being afraid of finishing my final cigarette, I actually got really really energetic and happy. Today has been a breeze. The physical withdrawl is there but it's incredibly easy to manage now that the mind games have been removed and honestly, the thought of having a cigarette is repulsing. Anyone having trouble quitting should really give the book a shot and try it out because the worst that could happen to you is that nothing will change while the best that can happen is you could become a non-smoker. Good Luck everyone!

At what point do I start feeling human again? Because I still want to smoke, and I still don't know what nonsmokers do with their time. I've become a recluse and honestly that shit is less healthy than smoking ever was. I have family shit coming up and that shit is stressful just thinking about. When they start getting in my nerve I'm not going to have an excuse to get away now haha. Fuck this sucks.

want to quit vaping

I'm not sure if it fits, but I really want to quit vaping. I locked the vape in my car yesterday, but today at around 11 I got it out again. I really need to stop because i tend to chain vape and I don't like it at all. Also dealing with a lot of anxiety at the moment so it's super hard. Any suggestions?

Just went for my second jog. ~36min.

One of the reasons I quit was because my cardio was shit. I went red in the face and was out of breath with a moments effort. Going over my pathology class notes I found that these were symptoms of emphysema. I didn't rush off to the doctor. Lifestyle advice is given in most of these situations anyway. Stop smoking and start exercising.  

 So I have.

I just went for my second run around the local sports oval. Did thirteen laps, ten of them at a jog. so I ran about 5km, walked 1.5km.

e: About halfway through, I started to cough up gunk which tasted like cigarettes. Bye bye gunk.

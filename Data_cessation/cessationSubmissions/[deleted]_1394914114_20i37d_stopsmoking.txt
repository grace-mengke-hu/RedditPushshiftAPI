It's not getting any easier

Hey, long time lurker, first time poster...

I quit on March first and was really looking forward to not smoking anymore, had a good attitude, all that jazz, and was doing pretty well for the first week (hell I remember on my seventh day being excited about a little craving because it was the first time I thought about cigarettes all day). 

But... my second week has gotten progressively worse and worse. My smoker pangs may not be as frequent, but they seem to be a lot worse, I've been depressed, irritable, and everything really just kind of pisses me off.

I'm not looking for an excuse to smoke, and this might be psychosomatic, but I was able to get through the first week by telling myself that I didn't want to smoke, what I wanted was NOT to WANT to smoke (because you smoke to end your nicotene hunger), but now my desire to stop constantly craving a cigarette is beginning to outweigh my desire to quit smoking. I thought the first week was supposed to be the tough one and it just seems that screws have been getting tighter and tighter, and with saint patty's day I'm really starting to not like my chances.

So any advice, encouragement or snotty remarks to help me through this?

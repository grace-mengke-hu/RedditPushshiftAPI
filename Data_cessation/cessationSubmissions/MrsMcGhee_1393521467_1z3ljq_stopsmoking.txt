One Week Without

I decided to quit smoking on Tuesday, February 18th. It was late in the morning, a few hours before starting my afternoon shift at work. Like every other morning, I was drinking coffee and chain smoking. 

When I only had one cigarette left, I stared at the cigarette and laughed. "What the fuck is this?" I asked myself. Just then, I quit. Just like that, I told myself that I was done.

I haven't smoked a cigarette since then. I feel great! I have tried to quit many times in the past. I think the reason why I feel so much better this time is because it was fully a choice of my own. I wasn't doing it for anyone else. Do I think about smoking? All the fucking time. But I just wait a few moments and the craving is gone. How stupid is that? I used to give in right away when all it really takes is a few minutes to forget about sticking a cigarette in my face hole.

I'm not going to smoke another cigarette. I am done. I made a promise to myself and I am going to keep it.

I am so proud of myself and I just wanted to share with all of you.

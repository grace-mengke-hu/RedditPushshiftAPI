I may have found the secret, well at least for me, and probably you too!

I have a confession to make.

I have joined here 215 days ago apparently. However, I have been on and off smoking until about 4 months ago, and I haven't touched them since.

When I used to "quit" I would make lists, calenders, charts, and often post on this very subreddit.

But it didn't work.

You know what did though? Not thinking about it.

I threw out all of my lighters, cigarettes (obviously), posters of people smoking that I had, my charts, notes and everything.

I feel by measuring your non smoking, it acknowledges that smoking is in your life even if your not doing it.

Just live your life, love your family, do your job, have fun with friends.

Just don't think about smoking, this includes measuring your progress.

Who cares how long you stopped, you stopped, its over.

This is the last of me here on this subreddit, you have all been extremely supportive. Thank you!

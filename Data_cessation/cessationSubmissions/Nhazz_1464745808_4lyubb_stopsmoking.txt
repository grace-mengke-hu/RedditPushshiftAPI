A year. A whole year.

I started smoking when I was thirteen. I grew up poor, and that's just what a lot of poor kids did; we stole our parents' cigarettes and we met in a secret place and we smoked. My father smoked until it killed him, and all four of my sisters still smoke. I grew up in clouds of smoke; I didn't really know any other way. 


Twenty six years and I don't even want to think about how many cigarettes later, a few things happened: I found this subreddit, I read Allen Carr's Easy Way (I know, I know, he gets mentioned a lot), and I realized that I was letting my past stink up my otherwise beautiful present. I knew how dangerous and unattractive smoking was. I felt stupid, and mad at myself, so I quit. 


I wasn't sure if I was going to write a one year post, but thinking about all the things I would say kept me motivated. This has been the single best thing I have ever done for myself. My clothes/car/home smell amazing, my skin and hair look great, my teeth are whiter.  More important than any of that, though, I feel confident and in control of my life. I feel vibrant and hopeful and finally, at 40, like an adult who has my act together.


So, what I want to say to those struggling to get a day, a week, a month behind them: you deserve to feel this great. I promise you, deciding and believing that you're really going to do it is the absolute hardest part. I know that it's scary, but the rewards are so good. Believe in yourself!

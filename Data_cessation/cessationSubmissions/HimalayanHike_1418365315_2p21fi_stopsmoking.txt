Entering one of the most stressful stretches of the year. Don't care, going to quit anyway.

The next two weeks will be very challenging for a number of reasons. I have been down this road before, and I think I'd rather deal with the nicotine withdrawal now. I was once fairly active here, but I left because I was too embarrassed to admit I had relapsed. 

I don't know how to just enjoy being in a normal state. I've had major struggles with other substances and mental illness in the past, and smoking (vaping I guess, but they're the same to me) has been a crappy mental crutch. I thought it would make me more productive, ease my anxiety, and manage my mood. This might not be a shock, but it's not doing any of those things.

About an hour ago, I tossed both my ecigs in a faraway trashcan and dumped all remaining liquid down the drain. I was a pretty constant smoker, and I used the liquid with the highest available nicotine content, so this will probably be rough for a few days. Halfway through typing this, I got up to go outside and smoke. Then I remembered LOL.

I head home to see my family in a week. Typically, I quit as I arrive at the airport, of course with the full intention of resuming once I leave my family home. As a result, I'm a complete grouch while there, and it's not fair to my parents. I am hoping this week will give some time for my brain to even out a bit and for me to learn some coping techniques.

I hate being tethered by this junk all the time. I hope to update with some good news soon!

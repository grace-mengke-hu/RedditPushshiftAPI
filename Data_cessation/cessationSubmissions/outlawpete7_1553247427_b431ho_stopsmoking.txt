Respect for my father

To preface this: I am not into smoking, this isn't about me. 
I never really knew my father, he left when I was quite young and I only have few memories of him, which leads me to always wonder, what kind of guy he was... 
There are some stories people around me have told me about him, but this one story I think about more often than the others: My father has been smoking since he was 14 years old. When they got the message, that my mother was pregnant, he immediately stopped smoking - he has been smoking 3-4 packs a day for 16 years at that point. It always fascinated me, how very selfless and strong this act of him was, and even though I know, that he left us to at some point, I found a great feeling of respect for his endeavour of self-control, especially since I got to know so many people, struggling with nicotine-addiction and how hard it seems to be on them. 
So what I want to give the people on this sub, that are currently trying to quit their addiction with on their way, is that, even though you might not always want to rely on other peoples opinions about you, just know, that I believe that in society, people cherish the ones that have pulled themself together, that have a well functioning sense of self-control and that radiate it. I can't be the only one.

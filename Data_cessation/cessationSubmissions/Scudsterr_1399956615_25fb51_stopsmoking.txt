Finally went to a party after 3 months of avoiding bars. I saw 100's ciggs smoked during the night. Never gave in.

I had been avoiding bars since I quit, because alcohol would always tend to make me relapse, this time was different!  I finally got invited to a party with some old college friends that I couldn't turn down, and I felt ready for it.  I knew there was going to be many, many cigarettes around.  It kinda felt like I was walking into the lions den.   

I had the right mindset though, and because it had been 3 months, I felt extremely detached from being a "smoker." 

Right at the beginning, before the party started to grow and it was just my old college friends, one who didn't know I had quit offered me one.  I declined and then he said, "Good for you man, I won't smoke around you."  This was a very nice gesture for a friend, but I knew what I was getting into tonight and I said, "Don't worry about it man, I'm gonna be surrounded by them tonight, it won't matter"  

It did not matter, once the crowd showed up, people were burning them down right and left.  I'm not gonna lie and say that I wasn't hit by the urges or the nostalgia to smoke, but it was almost like it was just out of the question.  Like my mindset was, "Oh that would be nice, but we have just come too far."

I hope you all can get to where I am, I don't think smoking will be a problem for me anymore.  I'm sure the urge to smoke will never truly disappear, but I feel like a new person who can deal with similar situations in the future.

Give yourself sometime to quit and readjust, then maybe you can walk into the lion's den with me and we'll emerge as champions.

Relapse addiction is over!

I am 24 male who smoked a pack for almost 8 years. Last 3 years was like “if i get through this i’m done with smoking” It goes this and that and obviously things never end so i kept smoking. I read Allen Carr’s amazing book and after that i managed to stop 12 days. I felt significant improvement on my health but you know the end of the story. It was my best attempt if you count my another dozens. But after that ı lost my believe of myself to accomplish this little time again. I’m smoking in guilt, feeling like shit.

 I am desperately need your thoughts on me and i’m going to introduce myself a little. I work as a flight attendant for 2 years. Knowing of working on smoke free place is made me think of “i can’t be smoking too much so it won’t hurt”
But as you know it destroy you day by day. I am feeling the negative effects. I am a quite skinny guy always wanted to gain some weight but my metabolism is fast also my bad habit make it faster. My face is thin and i always have some acnes. My sexual life is horrible also my drive to it. I feel tired ALL THE TIME. In my longest attempt i was already feeling the healing effect on this significant issues. Stopping smokes get to the point i was not able to anything without stopping it. I get myself to this point because i’m determined to stop that shit immediately. So i will use it to my advantage from now on. I am going to 4 day layover and will not take any smokes with me but some patches. If i get through some days without smoking, i am sure it’ll be easier to stop NRT’s. I reset my timer, requested a new badge, disposal the gross shit and determined to not to smoke again, NO MATTER WHAT! 

Wish you all the best,

Has anyone tried a Fidget toy to help with quitting?

So I started printing these [fidget spinner toys](https://youtu.be/XIfU05hZ_IM) and got a big response from the ADHD/ADD community. My uncle mentioned that it might help with quitting smoking. Some people just need something to occupy their attention since the cigarettes aren't there anymore. I won't post it here, but the is a link in the video if you wanted to order one. $18 shipped. Discount on multiple spinner orders. 

As always, if this kind of post isn't allowed please delete it. I just wanted to see if I could help anyone kick the habit. Have a great weekend!

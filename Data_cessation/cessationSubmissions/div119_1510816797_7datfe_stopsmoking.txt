Thank God that I quit this addiction!!

A few years ago when my wife and I were planning on having kids she told me if I want kids then quit and it really helped me and now I'm happy I can't even think how I used to be able to smoke!!! Thank you my beloved wife! and now I have a son and a daughter and we're shooting a video! here's an example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j7AM_dEoH0

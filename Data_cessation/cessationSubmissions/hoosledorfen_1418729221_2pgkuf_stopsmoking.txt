48 hours down... The rest of my life to go!

I did it! This is the first time I've gone 48 hours without a smoke and I feel received and stressed at the same time. 
Will admit I'm struggling with it. So much time. Makes me wish I had a hobby haha.

I really don't have a reason for this post.. no one else seems to care much about this so maybe some one will :) 

Thanks for reading my rambles. They will get worse as time goes on, I can assure you

Typical duration: a few days

Coping: Drink more fluids (water); use hard candy/cough drops; focus on having clean lungs

**Inability to concentrate/pay attention/focus; Feeling spaced out or in a fog**

Cause: You are not getting stimulation from nicotine; Carbon Monoxide is leaving your system

**Trouble sleeping/Insomnia**

Cause: Nicotine alters the brain and affects sleep patterns

Typical duration: A few weeks

Coping: Avoid caffeine after noon; Get more exercise; Do relaxation exercises before bed; if you can't fall asleep, don't just lie in bed, get up & do something until you feel drowsy

**Constipation; Gas; Stomach pains**

Cause: Decreased intestinal activity

Typical duration: A couple weeks

Coping: Increase fiber (fruit, veggies, bran/whole grains) in your diet; Drink lots of water

**Increased hunger**

Cause: Nicotine is a synthetic appetite suppressant; the urge to smoke sometimes mimics hunger

Typical duration: Up to several weeks

Coping: Learn healthy eating habits; Snack on healthy foods; Distract yourself; Recognize these feelings may not be due to hunger; Exercise; Drink water

**Cigarette cravings**

Cause: You just want another cigarette-early on it might be an urge to curb withdrawal symptoms; at any time during recovery it may be out of habit or be triggered by a situation in which you used to smoke

Typical duration:  Each craving only lasts 3 to 5 minutes! You may have cravings every now and then for months, but they are more frequent in the first few days

Coping: Take deep breaths; Distract yourself; Know that these CRAVINGS WILL PASS QUICKLY!

**Low blood sugar; confusion, dizziness, feelings of weakness**

Cause: cigarettes cause a spike in blood sugar, so quitting may mess with your stability in this area

Typical duration: Probably less than a month

Coping: Drinking lots of fruit juice will help, the fresher the better as fresh fruit juice has many nutrients your body can use to aid the process of healing after smoking

**Acne**

Cause: Stress, changes in diet, hormonal shifts due to quitting and the detoxing process of your body purging itself of unwanted elements brought about by smoking have all been cited as possible explanations

Typical duration: Varies, 1-2 months at the absolute maximum

Coping: Traditional skincare regiments and products should help. Staying hydrated, eating healtihily and getting lots of nutrients in your diet ought to help.

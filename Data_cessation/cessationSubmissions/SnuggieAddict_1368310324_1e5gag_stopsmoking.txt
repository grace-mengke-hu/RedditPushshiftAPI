Starting day 6, and first social event since becoming a non smoker.

Yesterday I visited my parents. They have been extra supportive about the whole process. Yay! Also, my husband finally came back from his business trip. He smokes.
This morning as we got up I drank a glass of water and he lit up a smoke - and I didn't care. Of course, I wish he wouldn't smoke, but it didn't cause any serious craving. He even stood next to the window to make the smell tolerable.

And later today was my first social event since I became a nonsmoker. A big one. A huge demonstration with thousands of people and hundreds of cigarettes. I didn't cave in once. I noticed my thoughts slowly shifted in the last week from "I want a cig" to "I would have smoked a cig now, but I'm not a smoker".

Best part of the day: talking with a friend who smoked right in front of me, and suddenly feeling a slight repulsion from the smell.

Tl;dr - getting better, enjoying the process and kicking some addiction ass. Gonna get my badge on Monday!

Do you agree with Allen Carr that there is absolutely nothing enjoyable about smoking a cigarette?

I finished "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" book a few days ago and haven't smoked since. I'd say it worked as I'm fairly confident I will stick with quitting long term. 

But I think part of his overall message was still a little lost on me, his whole idea how smoking actually isn't enjoyable and it's just an illusion. I'm pretty sure I genuinely enjoyed smoking. 

As such, while I did quit, I'm not finding it quite as 'easy' as is suggested

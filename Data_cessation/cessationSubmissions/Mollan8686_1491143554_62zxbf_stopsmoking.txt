1 Year :)

I extinguished my last cigarette 1 year ago, on an early morning, right before taking the train for the airport to go on a business meeting in the US.

I survived the trip and also to the intensive meeting, so I decided that if I made it in that stressful occasion, I could have made it every day. Now it would be very weird to smoke, as the cigarettes routine is not integrated in my life anymore.

Going down to the numbers: 548â‚¬ and 1825 cigarettes not smoked.
Thanks to everybody for the support :)

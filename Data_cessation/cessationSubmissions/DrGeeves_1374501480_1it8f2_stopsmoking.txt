smoked 18 years, 5 months quit, having a tough time today.

I'm breaking out in the same rash that *caused* me to quit 5 months ago.  Ironically it's making me crave a smoke a little bit, even though the taste would be unfathomably foul.  I'm just really stressed out right now, I have a lot going on and I'm not taking care of it well at all.  God fucking damnit, why is this still so hard.

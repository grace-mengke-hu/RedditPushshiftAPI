I can't concentrate on anything after 3 weeks.

It's been a fairly easy 3 weeks for me since I stopped smoking weed and tobacco. I had some limbo effect but nothing I couldn't handle. I excercise every day and I try to do my best at work. It's been a pretty productive period of my life I'd say. However 3 days ago I started feeling like sh*t and depressed. It's not like I'm carving to smoke again, not at all! I just can't keep things in my mind and I feel dizzy all the time. Even thinking about talking to my beloved ones disgusts me. Somehow I fell into a deep deep depression. Also I can't stand my flatmate anymore or anyone else around me. I wonder if this is going to end and that you'd ever experienced a similar situation?

I am doing it. So everyone can!

With yesterday I made two months smoke free. I never thought to manage standing so far, expecially because I have exams. I have some craving every day, but it is never as hard as the first days. I just ignore them and continue studying.

It was a while I was not writing, but now it is time to share this achievement with you, as you supported me through the first period.

I observe that when cravings are strong, I manage to stand by reminding myself that a puff means every counter going back to zero

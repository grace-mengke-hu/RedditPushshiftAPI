Frustrated af

I used nicotine lozenges again, bc as sure as I am that I'm not going to smoke, the nicotine still soothes my anxiety.  I'm dealing with a relationship that leaves me frustrated and feeling used, and it's triggering me.  I know o need to probably end it, but of course, I'm in love, so, I'm procrastinating.  In the meantime,  any bumps in it and I am craving nicotine.  I am not missing cigarettes much, but I think that's mostly bc I'm still getting nicotine.  I still have a crutch to lean on.  Not sure how I feel about that really, but, I just keep thinking, at least I'm not smoking cigs.

I know this is stop smoking, but any life hacks for ending a relationship that is me in love, him knowing it and using it to his advantage?  Gd,  life is just hard sometimes.

(Day 1) Let's Go!

I've reached the age where I've now been smoking for longer than I haven't been smoking and realized that it is time to give it up.

I watched a youtube video on self-discipline yesterday and figured that today would be the day.  I've tried to quit several times before.  I'm hopeful that this is the one that sticks!  My strategy is everytime I want a cigarette, I'm going to take a deep breath and feel how shitty my lungs feel (normally cough stuff up every morning).  Hopefully, that will remind me why I'm quitting.

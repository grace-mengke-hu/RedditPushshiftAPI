Fell off the wagon and can’t seem to get back on

I quit for 9 months and it was pretty much the easiest thing I had ever done. I went through some really stressful stuff over the summer and started smoking occasionally but now can’t seem to stop smoking a few every day or 2. What have you guys done to get back on the wagon after falling off and stay on? What worked before doesn’t seem to be working now.

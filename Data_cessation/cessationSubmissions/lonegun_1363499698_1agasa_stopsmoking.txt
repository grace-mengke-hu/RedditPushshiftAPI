Three Smokes Left.

I have three smokes left in my pack.  Once they are gone, I will be throwing away my lighters, and ash trays and attempting another go at quitting.  I have a cheap E Cig as a crutch for now.  This is going to suck, but for my daughter, GF, and wallet, I need to kick this habit.  Glad I've got this Sub for the support, and catalyst to make me quit.

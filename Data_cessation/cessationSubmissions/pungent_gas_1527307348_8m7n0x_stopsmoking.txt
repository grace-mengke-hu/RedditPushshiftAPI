I can't escape the smoke. It's there when I'm at work and when I'm at home.

I really want to quit, but my environment makes it very tough to do so.

I've been living with smokers for about 6 years of my life, which 1 year in which I was cigarette free (lived with my parents, who are not cool with smoking).

Now I got a new job and live with 2 friends who are 1 pack/day smokers. I'm in this endless cycle of bumming off them and then buying them packs after I start bumming too many. Then I bum off them again after I buy them packs and continue to do so again.

Same with work, I work with 6 people I'm good friends with that all go out every 1.5 hours for a cig break. I feel the need to go to socialize and not seem like a recluse. I tried staying at my desk to avoid joining them and smoking, but I end up going anyways, telling myself "you need to take a break and  talk to some people"

My friends (roommates and workmates) will also politely offer me a cig sometimes and I will 100% of the time accept, even if I'm trying to "quit".

I'm at a loss here.

Cold turkey doesn't work for me.

I've been considering getting an ecig for the lesser health consequences, but I'm still wondering what the point is, I'm replacing one addiction for another and nicotine in and of itself is still very harmful.

My environment is working against me and I've tried very hard to quit.

What do I do?

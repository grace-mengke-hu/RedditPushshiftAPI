Do you guys have any advice for actually REMOVING the carcinogens from an apartment that's been smoked in for 20+ years?

My roommate and I have always been clean and not smoked. We moved into a place that apparently had been smoked in for 20+ years. The entire apartment reeks of it despite my landlord claiming they gutted it out and cleaned it, repainted and replaced the AC/heat central unit. I can't stop waking up in the middle of the night to the strong smell of cigs. It makes me wake up nauseous because I have asthma. This is very unfair. I already moved in completely. We have had the walls cleaned, the AC unit replaced... I don't want to die of lung cancer, both my grandfathers died of lung cancer!! I'm a 23 year old woman and never smoked a day in my life. This is so unfair... we waited a month for her to supposedly clean this out. What can I do to get rid of the smell? Activated charcoal? Baking soda? Seems all the cleaning is legit and has been done, I called the construction companies who worked here and they even came down to check it out. Nothing helps.

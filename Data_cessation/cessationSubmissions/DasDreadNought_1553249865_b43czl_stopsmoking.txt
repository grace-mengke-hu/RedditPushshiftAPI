The worst part

The worst part about smoking is that everyone realises it is harmful.
That they want to quit
That they want to be free
But each time they quit
Come crawling back
They lose a little faith in themselves.
"I can't quit"
And the next attempt is even harder.

You can say that smoking is a drain on your health and wallet. But I think that loss of faith in yourself is the worst part. It is common in all addicts of all drugs, but smoking gives you nothing in return.

5 days free and counting.

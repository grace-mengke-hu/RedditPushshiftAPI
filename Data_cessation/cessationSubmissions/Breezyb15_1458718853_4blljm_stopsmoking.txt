Haven't smoked since last Tuesday. Today and Sunday I almost caved.

I've been smoking for about 12 years and just up and went cold Turkey last week. So far it's been pretty easy except for when my brother comes over because I know all I need to do is ask for a cigarette. 

He was here today and I used his car Sunday and notices a full pack just sitting there.

The hardest part is I actually liked smoking and I miss the taste and the smell. Thankfully I resisted and those cutesie oranges have been a huge help.

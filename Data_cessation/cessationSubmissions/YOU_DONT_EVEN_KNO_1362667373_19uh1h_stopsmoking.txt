A message to those just starting off.

This subreddit literally saved my life and got me to where I am today. I just want to give back by offering some advice to those that are starting off. 

I swear to you that it's possible. 

I used to smoke a pack a day for 12 years. I quit cold turkey by reading the book and visiting this subreddit often. I suppose I could have waited until 100 days but I felt compelled to write right now. 

When I was starting off at day 1, I had no idea what I was in for. Day 2 came a long and I thought at 5 days, life would be hell. At day 5 it was so-so, sort of felt the same as day 1. Of course I was still craving, it doesn't just magically go away. A week came, WHAT A MILESTONE! Suddenly, 2 week. Then, BOOM, a month. Holy shit wtf I couldn't believe it. At week 1, a month seemed impossible. Now I'm at 3 months. You can check my history to see how the days went by. 

What I'm trying to say is that it gets easier. I know it may seem like as days go, you would crave more and more...but it's pretty much the opposite. 

All you have to do is physically not smoke. You have to just not go to the store, buy the pack, and light one. Cravings will be there, but they only do 1 of 2 things. Either they pass, or they make you smoke one. At the moment, you may think that the craving will never pass and that nothing will make you feel right except for a cigarette. Well, that's just a drug addiction doing what it's suppose to do. It WILL pass, I promise. If it didn't, just imagine how all us non-smokers would be feeling right now. 

Hang tight. This fresh, free world is out there. You got this.

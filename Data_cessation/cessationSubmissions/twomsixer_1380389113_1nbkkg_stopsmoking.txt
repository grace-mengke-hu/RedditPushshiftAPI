Resetting my badge, this will be my third attempt quitting (first attempt cold turkey)

First 2 times were with the help of patches, so this is really the first time I'm quitting nicotine altogether. I have found 2 things to be extremely helpful so far. These Tea Tree Chewing Sticks (http://www.amazon.com/Tree-Toothpicks-Thursday-Plantation-Toothpick/dp/B0001U1YB8) and Hyland's Nerve Tonic (http://www.amazon.com/Hylands-Nerve-Stress-Relief-Tablets/dp/B001EPQ7L6) . 

Among the other, more obvious things like lots of gum chewing, keeping yourself busy (The couple days after quitting are probably the most productive days of my life, actually), substaining from alcohol (I plan to do this for atleast the first 30-60 days), and staying away from other smokers.

Good luck everyone. This is the most commited to quitting I've been, and it's nice to know I'm doing it without a crutch.

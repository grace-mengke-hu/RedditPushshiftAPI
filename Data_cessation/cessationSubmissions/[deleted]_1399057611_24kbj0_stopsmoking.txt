Cravings have stopped being so crippling

When I started to quit I saw several posts asking when the crippling cravings stopped. I noticed last week that I would sometimes go a whole day and only have a passing thought about a cigarette. Some days are still a little rough, but it is so much easier now. I may have actually made it through all of yesterday without even thinking about a cigarette. Hope this is encouragement!

Oh for additional encouragement I have saved $232 and avoided 10.7 grams of tar.

Helpful methods to stop

Hi guys

I've attempted quitting a few times and usually make it around 3-6 months then I get stressed with work and end up smoking again. I usually use the e-cig pens (not a vape as I don't want something that tastes nice that will make me want more of it) 
I was just wondering what methods you guys and gals and all Inbetweeners used to help you stop for good?

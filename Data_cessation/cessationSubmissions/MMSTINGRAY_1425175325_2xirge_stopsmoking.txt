Everytime I try to quit I get a swollen lymph node in my neck, a kind if blocked feeling in my ear and throat on the same side.

I went to the doctors and they told me it is from quitting smoking. The way he explained it was that quitting smoking effects your ear and throat and that is common. And that while less common quitting smoking affects your immune system which can cause inflamed lymph nodes. Two doctors told me the same thing and felt the swollen node, etc and said it definitely wasn't cancer or anything.

I have tried to look online for more info because I like to understand what is happening with my body but I cant find any information on quitting causing lymph nodes. I especially don't see why it would only affect the right one and not the other?! Anyone k ow where I can find more info?

Has anyone else experienced this? And any tips, non-prescription meds or anything to help?

Is a vape cheating?

I've smoked for the last 23 years. I enjoy smoking. About 3 weeks ago I got a coupon for a vape and thought, what the hell, I'll give it a shot. I've been puffing on this thing since then. A few real smokes here and there, but haven't bought a pack... I know I'm still addicted to nicotine and the oral part of smoking, but it is a LOT cheaper and dosen't stink... so, a step in the right direction, yes?

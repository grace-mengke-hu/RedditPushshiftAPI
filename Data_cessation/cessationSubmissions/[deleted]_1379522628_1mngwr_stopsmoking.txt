17 year old on the verge of becoming a smoker

A year ago my close friend started to smoke and during our breaks I would go out with him so that he could have his smoke.

One day about 6 months I said "hey, can I have a puff?" and he said sure.

This went on for a few months and then it progressed to me having my own cigarette every other day or so. Now I just bought 3 looseys and the thought just caught up with me: How will my habit look like 6 months from now? How will my habit look 5 years from now?

No fuck this shit, I refuse to become a smoker. I just flushed my sticks and made a plan not to hang out with him whenever he is having a smoke.

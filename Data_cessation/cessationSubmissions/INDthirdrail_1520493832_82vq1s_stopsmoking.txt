I ran a half marathon as a smoker...

I’ve been a runner for about four years. At first it was just a few miles, a few times a week. Last October, I ran my first half marathon. This year, I’ve committed to three more, along with other races, finally leading to hopefully my first 26.2 this fall.

Only problem? I was an 18 year cigarette smoker. People ask how I did it. I don’t actually know. I sort of “made it work.” No smoking at least 36 hours before long runs... justifying that it *really didn’t matter* cause some days I’d “only have four or five.”

Eventually I realized if I don’t kick it completely, I actually will die. 

I’m 8 days smoke free. I’ll feel better after 8 more, and 80 more, and 800 more...

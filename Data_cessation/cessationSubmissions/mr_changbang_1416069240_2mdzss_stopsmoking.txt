Help! Need some older perspectives on smoking.

I'm 18M and I'm a light to moderate smoker for about 2 years. I've been trying to quit for a year now, and I've been reading Allen Carr for about a month. I keep telling myself that there are no good reasons to continue smoking (and we know all the bad reasons), but somehow I still think that I have oodles of time left and that I'm still young. 

I need some perspective from older people who wish they quit when they were younger. How can I stop making excuses like "You're only 18. People quit when they're 30!" "It's no big deal, you've got a lot of time ahead of you if you want to quit"? Because honestly, that's the only thing that's keeping me from quitting, is the thought that I'm still quite young, not a heavy smoker, and that I can delay the decision to quit until much later.

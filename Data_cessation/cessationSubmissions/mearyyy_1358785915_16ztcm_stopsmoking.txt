Day four

Gotta admit, yesterday I may have gave into temptation and had two or three draws of my mate's cigarette.  However I have no regrets since when I did so the taste made me want to vomit; it was disgusting. Since this the cravings have gotten less, is it because i'm at day four or is it because those three draws have put nicotine back into my body and I have to start all over again?

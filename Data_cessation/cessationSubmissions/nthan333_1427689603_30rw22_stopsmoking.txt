Silly reason at around 6 months

I vape. I work construction. People smoke cigs around me and I think about a cigarette. Every. Single. Day. My sister got lukiemia amd i quit because i felt guilty. Tonight I'm drunk at a party. Cigarettes are a-plenty. But I'm not going to smoke. Not because it's unhealthy. Not because it will break my six month record. Not because I feel that guilty to my little sister about cancer. It's because Batman wouldn't. No you read that right. Batman is my hero even though he's fiction. He trained to get where he is. He worked for it all his life. He's a normal human. He had the dedication to follow through, something I can't say about a lot of things in my life. But tonight I'm not going to smoke, because if Batman can have the dedication to not give in to vices, I can too. 

I know its silly and honestly I've never posted on here so I'm ready for the responses to such a rediculous reason compared to the others on here I've read about. But I won't smoke tonight, because of Batman. And I had to type it out so I realize and accept the real reason better. Thanks guys :)

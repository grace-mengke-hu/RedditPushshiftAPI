How bad is nicotine withdrawal?

I recently quit smoking weed (I’m only on day 2) but it’s been pretty easy, there’s definitely withdrawal but I’ve found as long as I stay entertained and keep my brain busy it’s really not bad at all. But my dilemma is I smoked my last cigarette about an hour ago and I honestly SO BADLY want to quit smoking them, but I’m nervous. I wasn’t scared about quitting weed, but with cigarettes it seems like it’s going to be a lot to handle. But I will have a nice four day weekend so idk this seems like the time. My question is is quitting cigarettes really that bad? I know it’s not going to be easy but it would be nice to know what to look forward to. Thanks in advance!

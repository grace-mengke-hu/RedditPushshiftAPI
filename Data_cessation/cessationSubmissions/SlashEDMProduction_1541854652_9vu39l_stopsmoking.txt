Experience with Juul?

So I only recently found out about these things and it seems like they became some sort of a hype under younger people and also a meme for the internet.

I've been smoking a pack (26 cigarettes) a day for the past 10 years and I want to quit for good now. I was wondering if anyone had experience with the Juul or similar vapes to help with that.

What makes the Juul appealing to me is it's small size compared to other vapes. Most of the reviews I have watched however go over the thick clouds and the neat designs and whatever. I don't care the slightest about all of that, just want some support to quit smoking and prefferably not a big heavy machine.

So if anyone here has experience with the Juul or similar devices please share your thoughts on it. Thanks in advance.

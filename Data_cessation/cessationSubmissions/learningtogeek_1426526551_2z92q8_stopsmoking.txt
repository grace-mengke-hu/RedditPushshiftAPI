Almost 50 days smoke free!

I can't believe I am where I am, after smoking for almost five years. Everything was associated with a cigarette! I had to reprogram my brain, and I'm still working on it. But in the past few weeks it has gotten so much easier. I don't think about cigarettes much anymore and I don't really crave them. This sub has been a great help to me and I just wanted to say thank you; and to anyone thinking about quitting, I promise you can do it! All you have to do it not smoke :)

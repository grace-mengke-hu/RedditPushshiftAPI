First head and chest cold as a non-smoker

So, yeah, like the title says, I just went through my first head and chest cold as a non-smoker.  I sure am glad that I wasn't smoking through that.. stuffy nose, cough, minor sore throat.  In the past a cold like that would have barely slowed my smoking down, and I would have felt ten times worse!

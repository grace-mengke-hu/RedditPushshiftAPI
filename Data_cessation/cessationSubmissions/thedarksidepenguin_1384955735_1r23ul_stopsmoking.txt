100 Days. The Most Amazing Thing About Not-Smoking

The most amazing thing to me was when I realized that I have't had a thought about a cigarette in about a week. A whole burden of thinking about it is gone! You know, when you think about whether you have enough cigarettes for the night, when you ask for a lighter or a match, when you choose between different brands in a store, when you smoke before or after a meal. It's all gone and my mind feels a pleasant freedom.

So it's not even so much about health, it's also about leaving the unnecessary part of your life to focus on what matters.

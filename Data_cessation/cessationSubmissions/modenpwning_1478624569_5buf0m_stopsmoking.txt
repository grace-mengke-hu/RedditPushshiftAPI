Three days in...

I've used cigarettes to cope with memories and emotions for about two years, and now that I've stopped, it seems like the tough ones are coming on. My mom was a huge proponent of me quitting, and sometimes, it feels like she controls my life a little bit. Now I'm starting to realize she can suggest things, but ultimately it's up to me to live my life. Being three days in though, it feels like I'm trying to rationalize smoking again by saying I can't let her control how I live my life, so go out and smoke. But, 1. I know she's a proponent because she wants the best for me. 2. I could go out and buy a pack, but what would that solve. Smoking would be to cope with the pressure, and even it out to where it's fine and you don't want to change. I wake up feeling much stronger, and I wake up alert, ready to go. It feels so nice for a change. I also can sleep when I want to instead of dealing with insomnia. However, the cravings are there, but they are not very strong. I've tried quitting probably over 20 times, and for once, I feel strong enough to see it through, especially after noticing some immediate benefits. And it's nice for a change, that I can finally deal and process with these emotions, and I almost have to in a way, because if I don't inevitably I'll start looking for some other crutch. It's like sitting at a desk looking at a huge stack of Inbox vs. Outbox. and it feels overwhelming, and when you have a cigarette, the pile is just kind of...eh, that's alright, I feel fine. But when you take away the cigarette, if you don't start knocking out some of the inbox, you're going to go crazy staring at the pile, especially now that you've taken away the crutch. 

Just a few thoughts so far, hope you guys are making it as well.

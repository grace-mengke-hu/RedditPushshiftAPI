Disgusted with my Sister

My sister and her husband  are in thier 60s and have been smoking since they were teens.  My sister is very smart and we are friendly to each other.
 
She smokes Native American smokes from the reservation, at $35 a carton. 

He smokes a name brand he buys from Walgreen's at $60 a carton. 
 
At a pack a day each, that's $285 a month, or $3420 a year.

They are impoverished, but they have a paid-for house- they inherited my grandmothers house.  I got an equivalent amount of money.

They haven't paid property tax in 3 years and are going to be homeless.  The property tax is $800 a year.

She keeps trying to borrow money, for food or medicine, and I offer to take them shopping, but if I do, all they really want me to buy is cigarettes.  I refuse, and they get payday loans for them.

I hope this helps motivate people to quit.  Smoking can make you look stupid.

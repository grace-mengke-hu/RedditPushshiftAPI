SO smokes, want to help her quit, I'm not sure she herself wants to

She's "only" been smoking for 3 months, she's depressed and kind of fucked mentally, so I'm not sure if she even CAN stop.  
She promised me once, like an actual real pinkie swear promise that she would stop for a month for me (I detest the smell and the smoke breaks on our dates and other stuff I'm not going to get into) she broke the promise the next day.  
She asked me if she could break it, I said she had promised so so hard no, she still stopped our date, and went buy cigs and smoke.  
At this point I'm just rambling. Either way, stuff you might want to know for any tips you could give.
* She's depressed  
* She's a little unstable  
* She smokes weed/hash(obviously mixed with tobacco)  
* I adore her  
* I smoke neither and I pretty much don't even drink   
I need help here is fucking with us both kind of badly.

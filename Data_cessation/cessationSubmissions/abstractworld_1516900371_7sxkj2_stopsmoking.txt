Helping dad quit smoking

My dad recently started smoking again last year after 15 years of not smoking. I believe he smokes half a pack a day. I've tried giving him a vape pen &amp; vape mod but he doesn't like the fancy tech and all the maintenance. I've gave him a tobacco pipe but he doesn't like the difficulty of packing tobacco in the pipe properly. I gave him NicoDerm patches but he gets lazy and often forgets to put one on or remove it. He's always saying he can quit anytime but just wants to smoke for a few more weeks. He also says he needs to smoke because of stress at work and smoking relieves him. I just tell him whenever I see him and he smells like smoke that why is he still smoking. Does anyone know any good methods to help my dad quit?

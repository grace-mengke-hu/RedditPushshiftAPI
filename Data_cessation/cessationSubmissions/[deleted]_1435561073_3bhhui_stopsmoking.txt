I'm almost a week sober! Muscles won't relax...

About to have survived my first week. I keep noticing that my muscles are tense and I have to constantly keep deliberately relaxing them. Is this normal after a week?

Also... I had a CRAZY on-fire brain on Friday. Like, it was going a million miles a minute. I couldn't shut up, I had to keep moving, I eventually just ran out of the house and wouldn't stop running until I was exhausted. Is this normal? Will it happen again?

So annoying!

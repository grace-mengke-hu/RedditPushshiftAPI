I feel like I'm on the edge of the safe zone, everyday I think about it less. Loving it!!!

This marks my first attempt since acquiring the addiction 17 years ago. Here is what has worked for me, your list will be different.  

Here's mine:  

1.  Genuine positive attitude of..."No nicotine, not today, not ever" or when the monster is screaming in my head, just a polite.."F#%K OFF". 
2.  Memorized list of every reason why you think smoking is stupid.  Use it to remind the sane part of your brain.     
3.  Allen Carr's EASYWAY...Read it. 
4.  NRT, drugs, candy, etc....No, just stop doing it.  A brain that stays positive and rational is multiple times more powerful than anything in defeating this.  
5.  Daily Exercise...I have been a cyclist for a long time (yes, a smoking cyclist...stupid, stupid, stupid) I now cycle 20-40 km a day and enjoy it soooo much more.  
6.  The benefits....Huge!  Skin, Lungs, Breathing, Smell, all noticeably improved. 
7.  Weed...When necessary.  For me, it put a chill on the little beast.  Not advocating, just saying. 
8.  Water...drink-pee-drink-pee-drink pee...flush it out.
9.  This subreddit...I lurked a long time, commented a few times and thank each and every person that contributed.  This is truly a great place to be and I'm happy to be here to help others.  


My stats:  53yo M/77kg ...spent 17 years ingesting the poison at a rate of approx. a pack a day.  21 days ago I woke up and just stopped, I knew it was time after far to many days of mental preparation.  Yes, the first few days were a little unpleasant, but this is the price we must pay.  For me it was a small price, one that I won't ever have to pay again but instead will be handsomely rewarded everyday for the rest of my life.  I truly wish the very best to each of you in your effort to kill the nicotine beast using whatever means works.  Every day the beast is not fed, it starves, soon it dies, victory to you!

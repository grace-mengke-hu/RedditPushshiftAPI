Close to slipping

Almost slipped again last night. Every time it's during a fight with my partner. I got so upset that I stormed out the door, got in my car, slammed the door and screamed in frustration. I started the car and turned my headlights on and sobbed while I tried not to cave in to the desire to go pick up a pack of cigarettes. If I would have bought them, I can almost guarantee I would have smoked the whole pack. I've always been a chain smoker. 

Anybody have any suggestions on what I can do when I get upset/angry instead? How can I cope other than chain smoking?

Thanks for any advice.

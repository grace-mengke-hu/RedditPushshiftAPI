On day 3, having a really tough time

I find resisting the urge to smoke exhausting and I'm so tempted to just give up. I crave crappy foods, I am moody and sad, tired and unfocused. And I can't deal with the thought of having to be self-disciplined for the next years, constantly aware and alert to keep myself from smoking. Does it get easier? Does there come a point where I can just relax again?

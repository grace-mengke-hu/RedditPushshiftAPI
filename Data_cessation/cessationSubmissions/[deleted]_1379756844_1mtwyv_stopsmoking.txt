How in Blue Hades do I do this?

First off, I've been lurking in this sub under another username, but needed to post my experiences with quitting this damned addiction, and to ask for any advice from the community here.  As such, I am using a throwaway.

Background: 45, single white male, smoking up to 1 pack per day since my early 20s.

I have tried the following methods for quitting, and have never been able to surpass 3.5 months off the stuff:

- patch
- cold turkey
- hypnosis
- Allen Carr's EasyWay
- electronic cigarettes
- Wellbutrin
- Chantix

What complicates my quit is the fact that I am an anxious individual by nature, and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression in the past.  Meds (antidepressants or benzos) do not work with me, and in fact exacerbates the anxiety and depression.

What got me to smoke in the first place was an attraction to female smokers at an early age.  All my female relatives and my mother's female friends smoke, which has translated into a smoking fetish.

My last few attempts at quitting (and in doing so, attempting to suppress my attraction to female smokers) have led to increased anxiety that goes well beyond the three-day period most often experienced as the "cleaning the system of nicotine" phase.  I usually end up caving and buying a pack not long after.

Rereading what I've typed so far, I can't help but feel that I'm some kind of mental case because of all this.

Anyone have any ideas about what I could do to finally put this behind me?

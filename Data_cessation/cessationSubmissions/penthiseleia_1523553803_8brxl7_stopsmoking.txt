first beer (in the sun) without a cigarette :)

Feeling like I deserve a badge so giving myself one with this post. I guess there's a couple of mitigating factors such as me quitting only the last day before my surgery (two weeks ago) and therefore one could argue that this beer was perhaps a tad too early, and to top it off I paired it with a snus... but I still feel accomplished  ^.^  also because this has been my first winter in Sweden which made having a first outside beer basking in the spring sun all the more special. Cheers to a nicotine free summer, everyone!

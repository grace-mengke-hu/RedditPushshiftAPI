I'm so incredibly nervous, how am I ever going to do this?

So, I am a 26 yo male been smoking 10 years. Today I had a rather upsetting doctor's appointment (probably VERY light in compared to others) in which he told me my skin problems (eczema) are almost definitely linked to smoking. 

I have "wanted" to quit smoking for a long time but today was really a big shock to me. My eczema is very problematic and reduces my quality of life. 

My problem is that I work in the tobacco industry. And I see, write, read every day cigarettes/smoking/tobacco. How am I EVER going to be able to rid myself of the nico-beast. 

I need to rid myself of it, I am, for the first time ever, in a successful long term relationship and can see children on the horizon. 

Has anyone else quit successfully in a smoky environment surrounded by cigarettes?

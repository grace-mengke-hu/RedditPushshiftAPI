My advice to people who are just starting to quit

Get yourself a flair. Seriously. It's probably the best motivation to keep at it. I love seeing that number next to my user name go up everyday. I made it a month and now have a gold star and who didn't like getting those in elementary school? It makes you feel a long-lasting euphoria, something a cigarette could only do for a short time. Plus gold stars don't give you stinky clothes, bad breath, yellow nails and teeth, and poison you.

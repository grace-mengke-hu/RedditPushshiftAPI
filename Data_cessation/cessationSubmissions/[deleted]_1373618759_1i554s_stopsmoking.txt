We DO have our vices.

Today, I will admit that I have done multiple substances that have lead me astray. This has lead me to relapse after 6 days of sobriety. 


This is not the end, my friends. In fact, this has made me, and us, stronger. This has shown me that we can fall at some point. I want to encourage all of us that WE CAN fight through this. We will be lead into temptation, and IT CAN be defeated. Those few drinks (or other vices) can push us over into another cigarette, but it will be a reminder that we can fight the good fight. (Pardon my lecture for I have had a few drinks). Please don't be discouraged by faults, but see them as an awakening into a new light into quitting. WE CAN get through this. We have a wonderful community to support us. 


Please fight on my friends. Though it may seem like a wall at the end of the darkest of tunnels, we can make it. I hope you all have a wonderful night.

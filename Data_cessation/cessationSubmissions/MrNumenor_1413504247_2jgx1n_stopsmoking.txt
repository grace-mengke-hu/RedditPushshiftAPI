I failed, more than ready to try again

First of all, I don't deserve these 54 days. I lasted maybe like two weeks. Stress, habit and alcohol made me rebound to smoking a pack a day. 
I used to run a lot. Yesterday I had to full sprint for less than 5 minutes to catch my bus and felt like I was dying. 


Tomorrow I have a big concert I've been looking forward to for ages and I decided I will stop after that. 
Not sure why I'm sharing this with you guys but I feel like I did not only disappoint myself but also you...
I want to prove, mainly to myself, that I'm strong enough to do this and get back into shape again, even though I have quite some shit going on in my life at the moment. That brief moment of relief is what I feel like is the only thing which keeps me sane sometimes...


Mixed feelings and a fear of failing are definitely present.
I appreciate all the support I got from you guys earlier. It helped a bunch!

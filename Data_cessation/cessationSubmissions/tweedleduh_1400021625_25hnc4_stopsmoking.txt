Need Help

I am on day two of not smoking. I stopped smoking on Sunday, and yesterday was fine, but I was doing a whole bunch of stuff yesterday. Today I am just lazing around the house and am really bored and the cravings are hitting me like waves. Any encouragement or advice is much appreciated. Just being able to keep myself distracted long enough for these cravings to go away would be niceâ€¦ Thanks for the support in advance thanks guys

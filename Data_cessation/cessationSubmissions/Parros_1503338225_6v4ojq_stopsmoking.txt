Withdrawls from nicotine?

Hey everyone just stumbled across this sub today as I was seeking some help. So 2 weeks ago from today I decided to quit smoking. The first week was tough wasn't getting much sleep but I was under a lot of stress from other things as well. Week 2 was pretty good sleeping better feeling refreshed until Friday. Friday afternoon I had 1 cigarette (not sure why). Then all weekend and today I've had the nastiest head aches and almost a heartburn/ anxiety like feeling it comes and goes but the headaches at times get pretty bad. Do you guys think I'm suffering withdrawls and If so how do you guys deal with it, and how long do the head aches last for?

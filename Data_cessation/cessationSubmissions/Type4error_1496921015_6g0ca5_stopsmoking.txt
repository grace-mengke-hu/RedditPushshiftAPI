Day 13

So, it's day 13, cold turkey. This is going very differently from what I expected.

I'm 35, male, smoked since I was 17 or so, one pack a day. For a long while I smoked rolled cigarettes, without filters, which sounds horribly scary in retrospect. I had a single attempt at quitting, nine years ago or so, and it was a DYSMAL FAILURE. So I expected this to be incredibly difficult. I was all prepared for INSANE HARDSHIPS.

Well, it isn't, not really. There are cravings, sure, the symptoms of cessation are pretty horrible too, but it's not particularly hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing it wrong somehow. 

So, yeah, the good part: my performance in sports improved noticeably! I use Strava to log my things, and it's pretty incredible to see how I break my personal records without even trying. I totally did not expect such a rapid improvement. Kinda motivating (kinda). The cravings are totally manageable.

The bad parts: depression, lethargy, extreme sleepiness. Fits of coughing that produces no phlegm. Some headache. Acne. Some weird bumps on the skin of my finger, at the exact spot I used to hold the cigarette (that one freaks me out a bit). Overeating. A bit of mental and emotional sluggishness, though not nearly as bad as I expected.

So yeah, a big success so far. I've been wondering what makes this so different from the previous attempt, and I guess it basically boils down to that I wanted to stop smoking this time, as opposed to wishing I would stop. That, and I'm way more mindful about a lot of things, which makes it easier for me to realise if I just want a five minute break, and not a cigarette as my brain would have me believe.

So yeah. I do have this fear that I'll eventually let my guard down when the novelty of this wears off. That'd be a bit crap, restarting smoking months later.

14 days and counting.

Just found this sub, but 2 weeks ago I woke up and decided it was time. Something had clicked, cigarettes didn't taste the same, they didn't satisfy the urge anymore, and they just didn't feel right anymore. Don't get me wrong, the want is still there but.... the need isn't. Tonight was a milestone for me being the first day I've gotten drunk and not smoked in..... Years..... And it feels awesome. I really don't have people to talk to about this, but just being able to share my accomplishment with someone feels good.

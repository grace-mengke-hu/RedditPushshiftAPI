Quit smoking 3 months ago. Now struggling with cravings and urges (didn’t have them before when I first quit for the first couple months). Any ideas on how I can keep myself busy and not think about smoking?

I quit smoking 3 months ago this coming Friday. Everything was going great and I was doing just fine as far as cravings and urges go. I had absolutely none whatsoever. Now that I’m at three months they’re starting to hit me pretty bad.

This is my 8th time quitting. I’ve been on chantix four times, tried the patches twice and went cold turkey twice. This time was definitely the easiest at first but now it’s becoming quite difficult.

I’ve tried to get a pack of cigarettes twice now. Each time I’ve backed out. I know I would feel horrible if I smoked just one and I’d disappoint a lot of people if I went back. 

Any ideas on how I can get myself distracted? I read, I journal, I watch tv, talk to my best friends, call my grandma, just about anything I can think of. 

I’m really struggling. I don’t want to go back and I can’t go back. Any support or tips is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys :)

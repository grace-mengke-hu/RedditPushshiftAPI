For real this time.

I've quit before, several times. Every time its the same. The week leading up I'm full of anxiety... How can I start my morning not having a smoke with my coffee? How can I make it to work without a cigarette on the drive. Than I start, and I breeze through the first week high on self accomplishment. I think to myself how strong I must be, to quit with so little effort. Than two weeks go by, and I start thinking of how much I enjoyed it, and it was so easy to quit, and if they have no hold on me whats the harm of one more? But maybe not cigarettes this time, maybe a captain black. Its different, right? Totally different. I can buy singles. That will keep the addiction in check, just buying one. Than I go on a long drive, so of course Ill pick up two right? But two costs almost as much as a pack, so Ill just buy a pack and not have to worry about stopping the next day, and it was so easy to quit why should I worry. It's all downhill, and its a month later and my car smells again, and my bedroom smells because of all the smoky clothes, and I hate myself for starting again so I just buy a pack cause Im a stupid little worm and deserve ill health. 

I hope this time is different. I download the "quit smoking" app to wean myself off. My girlfriend is offering support... I hope to be requesting badges fairly soon!

over 2 months, but just reached a weird milestone: phantom cigarettes?

im not going to lie, ive had a few slipups... 3 or 4 separate occasions where i have smoked one. =\ but..... dec 30 was my official quitting day and i havent bought a pack since early december. was about 5/day smoker. woof. much has changed.

but last night was my first night going out for drinks and not having a cigarette. those were my slip-ups in the past, because i was around people who smoked and i was weak to the offer. :( but last night was the first night i had alcohol without a cigarette (i dont drink very often).

i was coughing ALL NIGHT LONG, as though i did smoke? it was like a deep chest cough. now this morning i have a bit of it too, i keep clearing my throat. there's this taste in my mouth like i had a cigarette, but i didn't. (really! i didn't. 2 beers over 3 hours).

has anyone had this phantom cigarette before? it really feels like my body thinks i had one, or maybe the craving is presenting itself this way. either way, i feel pretty awful and am going to be popping advil most of the day!

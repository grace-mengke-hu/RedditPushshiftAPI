How to stay the course when doing things that you strongly associate with smoking?

So, decided to respect my body more only relatively recently, about 6 days 12 hours and 28 mins ago. 
The first few days were BRUTAL, but after that I decided to take on running and go extra hard at the gym. This have helped keep the cravings in check....most of the time.
The only time the cravings get a little too much is when I am studying. I had the habit of going for a smoke break after every 30 mins of studying- it served as a mental boost and an excuse for a break. Now I cant study for more than 15 mins without catching myself rationalizing popping down to the local and getting a pack. 

Any tips for staying focused on the thing you are doing, when that thing is so closely associated with smoking?

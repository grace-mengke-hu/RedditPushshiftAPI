Quit smoking cigarettes for Black and Milds (cigars). The vape pens wont work. What Can I do?

So I have been smoking cigarettes since I was 20. At 30 I switched over to black and mild cigars in an attempt to quit smoking. Now I cant stand cigarettes or the smell but I cannot stop smoking the cigars. I know everyone will suggest a vape pen or something. I have them... They do not satiate the craving. Is there anything out there better for me than the B&M's?

Day 17 (advice)

Hey so this is the longest I've ever went cold turkey and its all thanks to you guys. Just being able to read everyone's take on quitting and how we are all different yet very similar in nature. Anyway, I just wanted to suggest anyone that's quit and saved some cash to purchase a watch, I bought an orient mako recently and its nice as a way to put yourself in check from smoking if you're ever having a craving. And no I don't mean stare at your watch all day, its just a milestone. Anyway, here is to a smoke free futute !

Day 1

I had my last cigarette at 5:30 this morning. About 15 hours ago. Running on patches and gum.

I've quit for months before and what helped was doing something I've never been into... Exercise. Specifically jogging. Push ups and sit ups also but mostly running. I'm 47 and its hard to jog when you've been smoking.

I know from experience that after a few months of not smoking you simply feel great. But that nicotine is hard to get away from.

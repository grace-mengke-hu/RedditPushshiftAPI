Trying to get my buddy to quit.

What can I do for him? We've been best friends for a long time now, and all I can do now is remind him that he promised me he could. I believe that it's never my place to tell others what to do with their life, but we have an influence on each-others actions in being so close, and I don't really know how I can use that influence to make him cut back on the smoking. Any tips? 
note: e-cigs and other nicotine substitutes flopped.

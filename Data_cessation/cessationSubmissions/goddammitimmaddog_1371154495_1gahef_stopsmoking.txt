Day One. Here we go, now...

So far I've made it through the morning commute, the morning break, the lunch break and the afternoon break, smoke-free. I feel like if I can make it through the drive home, after dinner and evening free time, I'll be golden. I've already started blabbing about how I'm quitting to my coworkers, so I must be serious about it. :) Wish me luck!!!!

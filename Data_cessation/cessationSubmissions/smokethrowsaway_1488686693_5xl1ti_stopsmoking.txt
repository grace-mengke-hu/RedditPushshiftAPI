18 months and about to break

My husband and I gave up smoking cold turkey the day we found out we were expecting. Lots of powerful cravings but I never even came close to cracking until I had to quit breastfeeding a few months ago and the cravings started whispering in my ear... "Nobody is relying on you to stop anymore, just smoke outside and change clothes afterwards and it won't hurt the kid. Just one pack...."

Yadaya. I thought it would pass like it has before but instead it keeps growing in strength and now it's intense and almost constant. It has been months of this and I feel like I can't take it much longer. Every time I see anything smoking-related or smell smoke or go someplace I associate with smoking I am completely miserable and it's overwhelming. Is this normal at 18 months out? What can I do? Am I a bad person for struggling?

Please, remind me of why I shouldn't go to the gas station and pick up just... one.... pack?!

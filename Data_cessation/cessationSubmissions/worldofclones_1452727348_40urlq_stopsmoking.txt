I don't know how to stop

I don't know how to stop smoking. I have smoked a pack a day for 15 years. I think about quitting a lot lately but every morning when I wake up I want to smoke a cigarette and then another 20 minutes later. The thought of not smoking makes me smoke more. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Day 2

It's evening and I think I'm going to go out by myself and buy myself some food. What kind of food would you recommend? I've heard some thing about our bodies having low sugar when in state of withdrawal but still I think that eating a nutela pie ain't the wisest choice because I could crash from it + it could create a state of need.

Gonna probably play some basketball with myself because I'm a social retard I guess -.-

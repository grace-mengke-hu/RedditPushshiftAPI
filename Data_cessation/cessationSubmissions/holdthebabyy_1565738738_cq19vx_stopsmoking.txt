Thinking about taking a short break in Amsterdam. Should I or shouldn’t I?

This is something I’d occasionally do without a second thought as a smoker, and of course my trips involved visiting various coffee shops and smoking different types of weed. 

I really miss these spontaneous trips and after a lot of hard work recently, I’m thinking I should just go tomorrow.

I’ve been completely smoke free for over 2 months now, although I feel open to smoking weed occasionally.

I’m from the U.K. and it’s really cheap and easy to do this type of thing, and my work can travel with me.

I feel kinda guilty about this idea and I wanted to hear the opinions of the people here

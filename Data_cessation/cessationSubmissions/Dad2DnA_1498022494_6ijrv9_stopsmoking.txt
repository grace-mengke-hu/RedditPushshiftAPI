Think I might have just smoked my last cigarette

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm away on business and just finished my last pack. I need/want to quit, and have for many years. I'm mildly drunk and fairly stoned and ready for bed. I'm not familiar with this area, and there is nowhere nearnby to buy smokes. I have a rental car and a hotel room I can't smoke in and a lot of work to do so I figure now is an ideal time. Wish me luck!

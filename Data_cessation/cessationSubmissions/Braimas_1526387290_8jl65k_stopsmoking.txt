I tried my first cigarette...

Hello, i am 16 year old male and from europe. I wanted to try smoking since I was 10. I have a smoking fetish, which means that I enjoy seeing woman smoke. Thats why I always wanted to try it and see if it fits me. Well at a party everyone was smoking and a friend of mine offered me  a cigarette. I didnt smoke it but held it for me for one week. Today my mum was working so I thought why not try it, i wanted it for 6 years now. I put it in my mouth on my balcony and lit it up. I didnt feel anything the cigarette was burning, i took a drag and inhaled it. I didnt cough. A disgustung taste which remembered me of tea I tried smoking 1 year ago in a aluminium foil pipe filled my mouth. When i blew it out I also didnt feel anything, I got a bit dizzy from the nicotine, which didnt happened when I tried hookah for the first time. I stayed taking some drags and inhaling them and blewing them out until I was finished with half a cigarette. I pressed it out and left it there. Due to the fact that my mum never smoked(only in her youth) I quickly sprayed parfume everywhere and brushed my teeth immediately and came to the following conclusion: I will never make the mistake that 1 billion people made before me. I will from now on never smoke again, I realized that I dont need cigarettes, theres a reason why people always tell that smoking ist shit: becuase it simply is. I didnt get high or get a kick(well I did but it goes away during time) it didnt even taste well. I mean i could smoke and get addicted really quick if I want to, but I dont. I want to have an healthy life. But in my opinion there is an good point for smoking: the dumb ones will kill themselves, only the strong ones survive!

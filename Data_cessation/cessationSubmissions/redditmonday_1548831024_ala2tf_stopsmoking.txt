Quitting is easy, I've done it plenty of times...

Yeah, I'm a loser, I've tried and failed many times. Just joined this subreddit, hoping I can be inspired to try again. The one thing that always helped me when I can cravings in my previous attempts was every time I got a craving, I would drop and do 10 or 20 push ups, or if I was at home, I would do some weights. Surprisingly, those cravings subdued really quickly. Reason I failed before was a major life event and I fell off the wagon. Cheers to the future!

Tried EVERYTHING! 62 days without a cigarette, after smoking for 15 years. Thanks, Blu.

A few months ago, I decided to get the Blu Cigs starter kit [(Blu - the electronic cigarette)](http://www.blucigs.com/).  I have tried Chantix, where I had awful night terrors, mood swings and deep depression.  I've tried cold turkey, gum, and patches.  
You start off with a level of "high" with nicotine, slowly ween yourself down to medium, low, then no nicotine.  You get a battery/storage pack that looks like a pack of cigarettes, which holds 5 cartridges (each cartridge equals to one pack of cigarettes), and two batteries (the filter part of the cigarette).  Blu gives you different flavors to try; regular, menthol, coffee, strawberry, vanilla, etc.. (the vanilla and mentol are great).  I haven't had any strong urges for an actual cigarette, any cravings or any other withdraw symptoms I suffered whenever I tried to quit.
From my research, Blu is apparently the best e-cig on the market right now.   Not only has Blu helped me, but it's helped my parents and my sister with their smoking.  
I'd definitely suggest to at least give it a try.  If you're not willing to dish out $80.00 for a starter kit (I bought the 100's), [try disposables for now.](http://www.blucigs.com/store/disposables)

Ok, I'm gonna try this (introduction and mini rant)

I'm 22/F I work at a drugstore. I sell tobacco to people all day, every day.

I grew up in an apartment building where everybody but my mom smoked. My whole family smoked at one point, or at least had nicotine. (Mom went on some weird nicotine patch diet a few years ago, don't ask, I dunno) As a young child, I would play smoke with straws. As a teenager, I'd roll up soda bottle labels and pretend to smoke. Right before my 18th birthday, I would hunt my apartment grounds and roll my own. For six months after I turned 18, I just bought real cigs. I ended up in the mental hospital for depression and quit cold turkey.

I smoked one or two over three years, just for that buzz. Then a few months ago, I started working for a drugstore and I was suddenly up close and personal with cigarettes again. I was stocking them, selling them, getting to know about them, training on them.

A month into my job, I suffered a severe reaction to an antidepressant I was taking, so I had to stop taking it. I felt lethargic and awful. And I just couldn't resist. One pack doesn't hurt right? I've been working there three months and it's catapulted into 5 a day.

I don't want to be like my family. I don't want to be like my coworker who hates everything. I don't want to be tied down by substances. I struggle enough with the depression, I don't want to deal with the addiction as well. I don't want to smell awful, I don't want to feel dazed without that hit.

I want to quit. I need to quit.

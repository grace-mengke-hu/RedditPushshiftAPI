DAE Feel High?

I went back and forth between oral tobacco and smoking for a couple of years, then transitioned to using an e-cigarette exclusively for the last two years or so.  I tapered down from 36 mg/ml nicotine strength to 6 and quit cold-turkey two weeks ago.

Anyway, I've had this sort of odd persistent feeling, which originally I thought was acute withdrawal, but has been continuing through today.  I feel kind of high.  I can do my work fine, as in my concentration doesn't seem terribly impaired, but I have this sort of fuzzy feeling and even music sounds different than I remember.  It's sort of like being on the very tail-end of a come-down from a marijuana high, but always present like some sort of background noise.  It's not altogether unpleasant, but I can't put my finger on whether this is normal or just a temporary thing while my brain chemistry adjusts to the lack of nicotine.

All of a sudden its really hard again

I don't know why.  Everything was going pretty great, and I was even having a day here and there where I didn't even think about cigarettes.  Even went out for BBQ and beers with friends, and after we ate everyone lit up and it didn't even phase me.  Why is it then that all of a sudden all I can think about is giving up?  I don't think I will, because I've gone too far and I feel like getting through this will only make me stronger, but still, I could use some encouragement.

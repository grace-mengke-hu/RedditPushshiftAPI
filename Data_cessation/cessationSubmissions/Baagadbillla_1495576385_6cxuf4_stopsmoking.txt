Have tried Multiple times, the most i could manage was 4 days.

I have it pretty much clear in my mind when I'm going to bed that I'm going to quit tomorrow. I manage for a couple of hours. But, then as soon as I sit in my car to go to work there's always this thought about having a smoke. I check, if I have the change and boom there goes the resolve. Any suggestions how to deal with that smoke craving?

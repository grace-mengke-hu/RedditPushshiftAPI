800

A couple of days late I know, these posts helped me early on so here's one of mine.

It really does get easier, I still consider stopping smoking to be the hardest thing I have done in my life, but over two years later I rarely think about smoking and can't remember my last craving.

Hang in there people, your wallets and bodies will thank you for it!

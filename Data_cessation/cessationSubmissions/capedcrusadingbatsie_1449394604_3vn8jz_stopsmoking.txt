Nicotine depraved = Acne?

Hello guys, 3 month old quitter here. I feel great and everything but something has been bugging me ever since I stopped smoking: pimples!

They popped up (get it?) as soon as I quit smoking and it's making me feel like I'm in high school again, self-conscious and anxious.

Is it normal for quitters to get acne breakouts?

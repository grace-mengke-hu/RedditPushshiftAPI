Motivate Me To Stay Quit at 22 Days

I just turned 37. I have been trying to quit smoking for at least 15 years, with disastrous consequences. Right now, I am at 22 days. Because it felt easier in earlier days, I felt more like a “non-smoker.”  Recently, I am starting to struggle, not so much with a desire to smoke as with despair that I will ever feel able fully to function without cigarettes. Would very much appreciate encouragement from those who pushed through and felt cured eventually.

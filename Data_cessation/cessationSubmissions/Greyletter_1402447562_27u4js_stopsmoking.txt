Quitting. For real this time. I want to be able to hike.

I went to the mountains today for a two-night backpacking trip. I made it, literally, ten yards before I was out of breath. After two miles of uphill, out-of-breath, stopping-every-fifteen-minutes pain, I decided to turn back, as I was having zero fun and the next four miles were only going to get worse, not to mention the even more strenuous 6 miles the next day. 

Fuck this shit.

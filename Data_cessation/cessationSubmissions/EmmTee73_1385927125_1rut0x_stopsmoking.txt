My girlfriend found my tabs.

ive hidden my smoking addiction from everyone i know for years. smoking helped me through depression, but left me with a nicotine dependance. ive recently moved in with my girlfriend, and she was devastated when she found my pack of 20 winston reds.
she's very upset for a number of reasons, one being that ive lied to her for a long time, and the other being that i've got heart problems.




she's always known i smoke a hookah once per week, and smoke a Medwakh pipe when i can afford to buy baccy for it. (medwakh is an arabic smoking pipe for Dokha tobacco, very strong nicotine buzz from it, see /r/dokha for deets)








in apology to her, i'm quitting smoking starting monday morning through the use of nicotine mints.





im going to continue to smoke hookah and medwakh when i can, but i'm never going to smoke a tab again.




wish me luck, and any advice is appreciated.

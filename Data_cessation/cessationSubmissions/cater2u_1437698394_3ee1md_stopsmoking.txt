Smoked for the first time in months... Feel stupid :(

I was stressed out because of something personal I was going through. I decided to cave and buy a pack. I wasn't even craving but I felt like this would help since it used to help before. I had half of a cigarette until I stopped and now my heart is beating all funny. 

Basically, I wasted money and smoked when I wasn't really even craving it. I now have a fresh, new pack that I don't know what to do with. I feel stupid :(

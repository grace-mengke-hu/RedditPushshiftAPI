A year ago, I would never have thought I'd be here.

I've only started smoking about a year ago, bumming one or two smokes off friends when we were out drinking. The slippery slope is real though (as everyone here probably knows) - fast forward to two days ago I was buying my own, smoking five a day and binging half a pack or more on nights out.

My dad smokes a pack a day since he was 16 (he's now 60) - he went through a heart attack, got surgery, and still smokes like it never happened. I used to hate it that he smokes so much growing up (and still do) so I never thought I would ever do it, but here I am. I feel like a hypocrite and it's time to make a change.

Today was my first full-day of not smoking and I hope I can get some sleep tonight. My last cigarette was at about 3pm the day before and I'm starting to feel the anxiety, slight dizziness, and fatigue; but I am determined. I've teamed up with a good mate of mine to be a quit buddy (he smokes quite a bit more than me) so I hope we can both get through this together.

I guess my story is a pretty standard one but I just wanted to write it all out to make this feel more real. I was also in the middle of a craving and needed to take my mind off it. Anyway, thanks for reading and wish me luck!

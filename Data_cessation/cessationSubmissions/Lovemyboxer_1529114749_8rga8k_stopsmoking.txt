I just want to say F it

I’ve been sick for a week. I haven’t smoked in 5 days. My fiancé is acting like a brat. He is not being supportive. Bringing his Butts outside and smoking in front of me. Like wtf?  It’s friday. It’s been 5 days for me and he is going to smoke butts in front of me?  On a Friday night?  I’ve given 8 years for this kind of support?  I’m pissed. I’m a Ginga female. And I’m pissed. Thanks for reading. I’m not smoking. Peace and love.

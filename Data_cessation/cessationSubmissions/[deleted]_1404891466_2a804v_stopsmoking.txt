So...it's decided...

I started smoking when I was 10 (I am now 26). I took about 2 years off during my early teens while visiting family that paid too much attention, then started up again at 16 because of some guy I was dating.
I've had 1/2 a real cigarette in the past 48 hours. (hit e-cig a few times during work so I didn't kill anyone today, but that's done, too, I think.)

Nicotine gum is awful. I chewed it too much and got hiccups, they just now went away.

I don't know if I want a hug, or something to punch. Is this normal at this stage?

I want to

I want to quit, not just for myself but for my wife and kids. My wife admitted to me today that me smoking is part of the reason we don't have sex anymore, and I don't want to be responsible for my kids having asthma further down the road. Problem is, I keep finding excuses for myself to continue.

Oh it's been a long day at work

I'm drinking so why not smoke

I'm stressed out

I'll quit after I finish this pack, I've already spent the money, why waste it.

The worst, and most common: I'm bored, what better way to kill 10 minutes

I need help getting past these excuses so that I can start stopping. Help me?

Your brains needed: best way to mark 6-month-smoke-free for the biggest ex-chain-smoker?

In about 5 days I will hit the half a year mark. Yeahhhhh!!

You can't imagine how big of an achievement that will be. I smoked a 20-pack a day for over 20 years. Unsuccessly tried quitting like a trillion times. 6 months ago I would have not bet a single euro for me. And now here I am! Not having had a single puff! I am the biggest surprise to me and those around me.

Although I still feel vulnerable, like I could light up any second, this is already one of the single biggest achievements in my life. A turning point. It marks a before and after. So it deserves a good celebration.

I would like to use the power of this forum to source ideas to mark this life event. 

If time/money/location was not an issue... What would be your best present-to-self or way of celebrating for having quit? 

Love you all, for the active and passive support you've been giving me. This will also be your success!

PS: money/time/location ARE limiting factors but let's ignore that for a sec and allow us to daydream!

PS2: obviously there is nothing better than feeling healthier and fitter. And I will not stress that hard enough. But let's be superficial for a moment and be hedonistic!

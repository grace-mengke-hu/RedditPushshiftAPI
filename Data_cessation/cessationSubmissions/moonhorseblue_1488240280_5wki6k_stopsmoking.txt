Painful

Hello, I stopped smoking 2 weeks ago. I only smoked for 3 years, maybe 12 a day. Now I'm in a lot of pain. Only on my left side. My arm and leg and chest and shoulder hurt. Sometimes it's tingling which isn't as alarming as pain. I also have anxiety. This problem got better after one week of stopping, but I'm still feeling it. Why is it only my left (heart) side? I'm scared. I read circulation takes 3 months to be restored. Has anyone else had this?

180 days without smoking. Back to square one.

Hello. After about 6 months of no smoking, I had a smoke. I was alone and bored and far away from home. I am also under a lot of stress concerning finances. I have taken to smoking again. 

I'm back to my old numbers ~15-20 a day (that'll help me with my finances). I can feel myself panicking and buckling under the pressure of meeting expectations. I don't know what to do. Advise?

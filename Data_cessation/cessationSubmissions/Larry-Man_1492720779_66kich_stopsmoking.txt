Opened up my Smoke Free app to quit again. Holy smokes.

My previous quit date on smoke free was November 20. I didn't do it and ignored the app.

I have even more reasons to quit because if I had kept my quit date I would have saved 671 dollars and not smoked a whopping 1,000 or so cigarettes.

That's 5 months no smoking.

I can't believe I've done this to myself. 

I am just shy of my first 24 hours cigarette free but I refuse to back down this time. If I needed another reason to quit the sheer amount of money saved is a sign.

I can do this.

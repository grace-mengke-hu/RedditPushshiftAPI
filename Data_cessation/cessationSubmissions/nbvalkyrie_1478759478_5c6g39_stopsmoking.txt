Cognitive effects of smoking

I have ADHD, unmedicated, and I feel like I was able to concentrate better when I was a smoker. I smoked from about 2007-2012, so I've been quit for about four years now. No slips, not even after an election night like we just had.

But I still could pick up again in a heartbeat. I probably would start vaping or something, if money weren't a problem. I guess what I'm wondering is whether anyone else feels they were better at some things while smoking, like academic work or other stuff requiring significant mental effort.

I can still muscle through (some) things, but it's been noticeably harder since I quit smoking. Anyone else notice similar stuff during or after quitting?

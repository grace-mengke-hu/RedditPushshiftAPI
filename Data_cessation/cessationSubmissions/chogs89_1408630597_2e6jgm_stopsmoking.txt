37 hours in

Made it 37 hours in so far. Cravings aren't too bad right now. Been a smoker for six years last four close to a pack a day. Quit once for three months when I had pneumonia and went right back to smoking when I got healthy because I didn't quit because I wanted to but rather because I had to. Hope I can continue this and quit for good.

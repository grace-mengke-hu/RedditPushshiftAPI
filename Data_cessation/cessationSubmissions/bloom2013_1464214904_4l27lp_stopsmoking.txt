How did you guys wean off the NRT (preferably patches)?

So I used to smoke 45 cigarettes, roughly, a day. I am now on nicotine patches. I have been lowering the dosage quite quickly.

* Day 1: went from 45g to 31g 
* Day 6: from 31g to 28g
* Day 12: from 28g to 21g

Each drop has meant that things are bad for three days and then they are better again, and I can't wait to be completely off nicotine. However... I am worried that my will power and motivation will wane if I keep putting myself through these lows without a significant rest in between (that's the logic behind the instructions in the packages, I guess). On the other hand, it might be best to rely on my will power and motivation *now* and make the transitions as quickly as possible.

And I know many are going to suggest to just remove the nicotine all together but I am terrified of playing the hero and throwing away the two weeks I have under my belt so far.

Any advice would be great! How did you guys weaned down? Why did you chose that particular strategy?

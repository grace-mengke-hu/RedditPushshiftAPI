Tips for cutting back?

Cold turkey is not yet an option for me. I need to cut back before I fully quit, because when I go cold turkey I fly into a rage. I know my brain very well, and my anger management issues are NOT compatible with cold turkey. 

Lately I've been trying to wait as long as I can to have my first smoke of the day, and also making tally marks on my arm to count the number of cigarettes I've had. Any tips for me?

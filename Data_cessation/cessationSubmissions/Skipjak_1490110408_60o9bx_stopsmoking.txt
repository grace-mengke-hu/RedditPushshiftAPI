3+ months - On resisting temptations

It's been three months since I quit smoking.
The first two months went very smooth. I went through some bad withdrawal the first week, but it got eassier and eassier. I focussed on excercise and kept my mind occupied.

I didn't smoke a single cigarette, untill last month. I spent the weekend in Berlin - a very smoker oriented city - where I caved and smoked a couple of cigarettes. 
Ever since, I've been handling things a bit more sloppy. I still don't consider myself relapsed, but I have smoked the odd cigarette or spliff here and there. I don't like it, and I want it to stop. Three months ago, I made the decision to stop smoking tobacco because of health concerns. I vowed to never smoke again, and I need to remind myself of that.

I'm finding it more and more difficult to resist to the temptation of bumming a cigarette here and there. Spring is starting to arrive, I'm spending alot of time outdoors, surrounded by smokers? Smoking is on my mind constantly in these situations. A couple of times I caved in and actually bummed a cigarette.

I seem to have forgotten that I managed to get through the worst cravings cold turkey. I have the willpower and discipline to not smoke, I just have to do it.
How do you guys handle temptation months into your quit? How do you resist the will to smoke a cigarette when out in the sun, having drinks, surrounded by smokers?

Please help me on this. I feel like I'm about to relapse.

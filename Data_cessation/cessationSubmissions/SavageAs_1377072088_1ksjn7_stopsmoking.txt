alright let's do this

From what I've read, cold turkey is the most efficient and most effective way to quit. I've given it a few shots over the past month, having never quite gotten to giving it all the way up. I think it's the shock of going from a pack a day to zero.

My plan is work towards a quit date incrementally. I think this will give me the time to prepare myself.

Smoking has impaired my life in so many ways, and quitting, to me, is a plank within a whole platform of getting my shit together and turning my life around.

My perennial excuse for resuming smoking is that I have too much stress in my life. I think adopting healthy ways of dealing with stress and eliminating stressors will be crucial to my effective quit. Hitting the gym, counting my calories, straightening my living area and workspaces, nofap, and meditation are all bound to have a cumulative effect of making smoking an unnecessary luxury and a more apparent obstacle.

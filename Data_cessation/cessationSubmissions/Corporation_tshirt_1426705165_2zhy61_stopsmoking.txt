Took up smoking again during a painful divorce. Two years later, quitting will be the last hurdle to get my life back on track. 4 hours and counting.

I'm serious about quitting, not only for myself, but also for my kids who I adore. I feel like achieving this goal will be the last piece of the puzzle to making my life feel whole again (corny as that sounds). I'm feeling confident and I've got the tools to get me to my goal.

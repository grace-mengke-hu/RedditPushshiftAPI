36 hours in, a LOT easier than you think.

If anyone is out there thinking about quitting and not doing it out of fear of difficulty, let me tell you something. Quit right now it's the easiest thing you've ever done. 

I smoked a pack a day, and I couldn't afford it so I picked up used cigarettes off the ground and made my own. I'm a drug addict its what I do. 

The only really difficult thing to quit for me is opiates and the hardest: masturbation. 

You got this!

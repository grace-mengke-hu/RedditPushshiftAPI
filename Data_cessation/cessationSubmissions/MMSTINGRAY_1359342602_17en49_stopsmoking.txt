E-cigarette has run out and I can't afford another, any tips to stay strong?

I could just go out and get a friend to give me a few cigarettes but I've quit for about 3 weeks now and I don't want to ruin at all. I'm definitely still nicotine dependent so while just 'putting up and shutting' up is an option it isn't ideal but as that looks like the only option has anyone got any tips on how to keep myself distracted and reduce/ignore the cravings?

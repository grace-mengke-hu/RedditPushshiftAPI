A 'massive' little helper to quitting!

After a heavy weekend away including lots of alcohol and way too much smoking I ended up bed bound for two days and the worst sore throat/cough I've had in years!
As I'm searching for sympathy from my non smoking boyfriend all he can say is 'you need to stop smoking look what it's doing to you.'
Normally I put up a fight but I actually thought this time I might have to quit for good. So the next day I downloaded an app called 'smoke free' simple but amazing!
It tells you how much money you have saved (basing on how much you smoked) how many hours and days since you've smoked and how many cigarettes you've 'eliminated' it's brilliant in my eyes.
It's that little push that's helping me and I've not smoked in 5 days which is good for me! 
Looking forward to putting the money into savings as to what the app calculates I would have spent on cigarettes!
Good luck to others starting there long road to giving up! X

Unfocused

I tried to quit smoking yesterday and it was going well untill today. I had to run some errands/ get things done and I was feeling so hazy and unfocused I stared at a wall for 5min. This led me to buy a pack so I could think straight. Has anyone had this problem as well? How long did it take to go away and what did you do to get through it?

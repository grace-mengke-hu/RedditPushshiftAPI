How...am I losing weight?

I had my last cigarette on Friday the 20th of July. I've been tapering for the past month. I normally have 5 packs a week and was down to 1 pack a week to none. 

My appetite has been out of control, even though I'm vaping (from 3mg-18mg nicotine). I'm consuming about 2500 calories and I'm 5'7" 130 pounds. Before I had 1500 calorie prepared meals. I smoked a lot because my main source of exercise is walking outside for about 5 miles everyday. I ate a fibre rich, no oil, plant-based diet (after I couldn't absorb fat from meat and oily foods after of gallbladder removal). 

I haven't exercised in a month because I'm putting all my effort into not smoking and going on my regular routes is a massive trigger for cravings. I'm also riddled with anxiety and highly irritable and my blood sugar dropping from not smoking doesn't help. 

Yet...I went down from 134 pounds in the beginning of this month to 131. I have medical hypoglycemia (from chronic pancreatitis) so I'm assuming this has something to do with my blood sugar regulating itself better from quitting?? Or is that crazy?

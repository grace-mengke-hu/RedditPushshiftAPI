98 Hourse Smoke Free, a personal record, will cravings ever subside?

Hello! 

I quit smoking four days ago, very peacefully, I was and still am very convinced about it, however my brain is gradually re-wiring and my cravings are gradually growing, for instance, today was just a long craving.

When will cravings subside?
Is it normal that cravings are getting stronger?

Any support or toasting is highly appreciated.

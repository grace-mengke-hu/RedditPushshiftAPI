I made it through my 3rd day and the nostalgia, then this morning our guinea pig died :(

I think the universe is testing me. I did not break down and have a cigarette. I cried it out, dealt with the emotions, and am still here, cigarette free. I still don't necessarily have confidence that I can do this, but the fact that I survived a 6-7 hour non stop craving/emotional roller coaster yesterday, and then an unexpected death today, I have hope. I did fall asleep before 7pm yesterday and have a feeling that will happen again today. This process is exhausting me, which I was certainly *not* expecting.

A few months cig free - skin peeling?

Hey guys, I’ve stopped smoking! Haven’t had a cig since December. I made the switch to vaping and although I’m still getting the urge for nicotine I feel much better. 

Anyways, I have some peeling skin now on my face. It’s fairly unsightly, and I didn’t think it was related to quitting but I did a little research and I think it might be the case that quitting has resulted in skin peeling (it might be related to vaping but I am unsure.)

It’s around my nose and beneath my mustache and parts of my beard. I’ve been using some beard shampoo and conditioner but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Any recommendations for products that has helped with this? It is very bothersome!

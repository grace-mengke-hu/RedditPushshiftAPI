One Month Down!

Based on what I see on here, I'm feeling very lucky to have had relatively mild withdrawal symptoms.  More importantly, I feel a sort of "spark" inside that I hadn't noticed was missing for the last couple of years.  It's like someone came and unshackled me so now I just have to decide what I'd like to accomplish next.  

It is absolutely certain I wouldn't have had such an urge to quit if I hadn't found this SubReddit.  You all are amazing people and I can't thank you enough for the support, advice and inspiration that has been imparted.  Good luck to my fellow quitters, and if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know!

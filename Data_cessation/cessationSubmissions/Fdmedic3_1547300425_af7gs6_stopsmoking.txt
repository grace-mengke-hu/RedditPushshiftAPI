Doctors appointment didn't go as expected.

On mobile so please be patient.

Yea so been smoke free sense January 3. Havent told anyone I'm my family. Was waiting to see who would find out first. This place has been a God send with information and support. Thank you very much.

For those who have been following me and know about my doctors appointment and how I wanted to see the surprise on his face. Well that really backfired. When he asked if I was still smoking I said No really really proud. He didnt even look up from the computer and said "well to little to late". I said what the hell does  that mean.

He has been following my blood work for the last 4 months. I had to do blood work 3 times in December. Well he has referred me to an oncologist that specializes in blood type cancers like leukemia. They well be calling me to do a bone marrow biopsy as soon as possible. I can't tell my wife or the rest of my family until I know something for sure. My family has lost 6 family and friends in the last 3 year including my father and my wife's father to some type of cancer. 

I dont really know why I'm venting all this on here but danm it I can't look at my wife or my son's face and see the hurt in there eyes. I dont want to say anything until I know 100%.

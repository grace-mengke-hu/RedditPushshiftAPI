Quit 4 days ago, now i'm experiencing my first smoke free hang-over

I've been smoking for 15 years around 20 cigarettes a day, so I concider myself a heavy smoker. Four days ago I decided to quit but I was feeling nervous for relapse going out in the weekend. Yesterday I went to some friends and we did some beer tasting (as we would like to call our fancy binge drinking) and I managed to stay smoke-free. I just woke up, prepared for the hang-over of my life, but actually I feel great! No headache, no cough, nothing! ok, a bit tired, and still slightly drunk, but awake at 10 AM,  from drinking till 3.30? Now I'm convinced, I'm never smoking again!!

Smoking last cigarette

I just read Alan Carr for the 10th time.  I hope this time can be different.  I always find reasons to restart but this time will be different. 

I don't want to be an I healthy smoker,  I am a healthy gym going running fanatic,  smoking does not fit into my life and I'm no longer willing to change my life for the poisonous herb 

I have been thinking about free will,  and the first step is accepting free will exists.  I do not need to live a life that I do not want.  I have the free will to shape my life and one major first step is to stop smoking 

My plan: everytime I have a craving going outside and taking deep breaths.  Smoking has always been about getting that 5 minute break,  I believe I can get the same reward without the poison I need to smoke. 

I am also going to work my way through the imdb top 250 movie lists and find some more good tv shows (any suggestions).  This should hope fully let me do something when I'm sitting around and avoid spend all weekend at the pub and reduce temptation. 

You'll likely see a lot of me over the next few weeks,  if anyone else is giving up now feel free to give me a msg for an accountability partner

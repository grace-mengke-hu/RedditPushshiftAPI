Cigarettes, you're next. It can't be that impossible.

So, last November 16 I decided I had to lose weight. 25kg (55lbs). I was weighing 100kg (220lbs) and gave myself six months to lose a quarter of that. "If I'm able to do this, nothing will stop me to do whatever I want", I thought.

I couldn't believe it I was actually losing weight until I started seeing some progress, and it was hard, but I had to keep myself motivated every day. 

It wasn't easy, but I did it, guys. Heavy diet, some exercise, less alcohol, less sugar, and I did it. Six months have passed, and I reached my goal weight.

So I'm here to say that six months from now, next November 16th, I will not have ANY desire to smoke. Ever again. I'm starting today, cold turkey. First - and hopefully ONLY - try.

Now it's on, guys. I'm quitting this shit.

To everybody that already quit: congrats. I'm proud of you all. Thanks for posting here to share your stories.

To everybody that's starting with me and from now on: COME ON! IT'S TIME! Let's do this!

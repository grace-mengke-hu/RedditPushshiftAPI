Today, I quit.

Actually it was 10 days ago, but nevertheless. Fuck cigarettes. I started smoking in my freshman year in high school. Why the fuck did I do that? I lost years, time and opportunities. No more. Not even a social smoker. Not one fucking last one today. Not even just fucking one when things don't go my way.

Because today I take charge. Things will go my way. I will make it so. No more "Fuck I'm depressed. Just one." No more "Fuck I'm don't care because life sucks anyways. Just one." No more "Fuck I'm worthless. Just one." From today, even though it hasn't been the clearest most perfect day, I'm free of my own sabotage. I will take control and risk for a better life. I'm smart and young, and my way is dark no more. There is a version of me I never touched. In a year, when I touch my body, it will be one as I always imagined it.

So I go from today. You too. You fucking quit now, you fucker. You do it now. You deserve your own respect. Not even one last stick. Throw it away. Grab a pen. Etch on the wall behind your monitor, "It is today." Because today is the day, and every day from now on is the day. It is today you will become the person you were always meant to be. It is today you let go of all the pain inside that led you to my words. It is today you and I, all of us, close our eyes, take the deepest breath, remember what was lost, let the bad air escape, imagine what will be gained, and open our eyes.

Now, etch it, and close your eyes.

Ready to quit.

I've tried many times before, but always ended up caving. I have a four month old daughter now and it has made me think more about being healthy, for the first time not for myself, but for her. I have almost a full pack. My goal is to go cold turkey on June 1st. Has anyone had luck doing it that way? Any suggestions? This is gonna be tough, but I'm ready.

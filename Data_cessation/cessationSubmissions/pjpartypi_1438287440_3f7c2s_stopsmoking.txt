Vaping with no nicotine, your experiences and advice please.

Smoker since 18... 36 now... basically half my life a smoker.  Starting to see the health effects which has me scared. 

I somehow managed a 'willpower' quit several years ago and lasted about two years.  This is my first so-far successful attempt (ie. longer than a day) in the last five years (Allen Carr book). 

I quit just prior to a busy and stressful 3-day trip; I found it surprisingly easy to get through the 3 days of nicotine withdrawal, likely due to distraction. 

Maybe it was too easy because now that I'm back home, I'm finding my habitual triggers increasingly hard to deal with.

I smoked under half a pack a day, but ALWAYS the following:

morning coffee
driving to work
lunch break
driving home
after dinner
before bed

I don't want to sabotage my victory but I have been thinking that a nicotine free vape could help. 

Any advice or experience would be welcomed.

So here I am, just smoking away...

I have to pass a non-smoking test in a few days. I have had my trials and tribulations with smoking in the past... I know that after tomorrow, I have to be DONE.  I feel it this time.  I went almost 3 WEEKS without smoking, then had a really bad relapse.  I know now that I don't like it, I'm just addicted.  And I know that I can beat the addiction.  I could be beating it right now.  It's just easier not to do so for the time being.  I have every reason in the world not to quit right at this moment.  Three days from now, I will have every reason not to start again.  To everyone that knows what I mean, keep on truckin.  To everyone else, you have no idea what you are missing.  Happy Thanksgiving.

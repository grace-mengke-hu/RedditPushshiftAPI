We can do it!!

Morning guys/gals I been a smoker for 15 years the last 5-6 years I smoked nearly 1 1/2 packs a day....I tried countless times to stop each time failing and be coming miserable.  Well here I am smoke free for 2 weeks today.  I used the patch for the first 2 days buy at the start of my 3rd day a switch went off and the nrt wasn't needed.  I think the biggest and hardest thing after the 1st week were the triggers.  Traffic/work stress/wife and kid/ and gaming (big gamer here and where most of my cigs  would be used).

Put your mind to it.  And use those apps which use motivation and notifications they are game changing.   It takes time and prayers practice this is the 6th time I tried and it's totally different then the other times.  This time I successfully quit!

Good luck

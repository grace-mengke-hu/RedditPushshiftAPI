Headache and lack of focus

Hi, 
So its been 16 days since i have quit smoking, cold turkey. I expected that the headache and lack of focus and concentration and emotional ups and downs would last like a few days. But its been 16 days and i still feel all the above and more. I was done with my exams and thus thought that i can manage with the withdrawals as i have 30 days break/vacation.

How long do I expect this to last more? 
My brain feels really weird. 

I have been smoking for 2 years and 10 months, with the average of 5-6 per day throughout.

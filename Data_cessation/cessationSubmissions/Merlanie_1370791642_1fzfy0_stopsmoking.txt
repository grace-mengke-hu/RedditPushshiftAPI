Trying again!

As I type this, I'm smoking what WILL be my last cigarette. I've tried and succeeded and then failed too many times. Next time I want one, I'm coming here to see that this time, I've put it in writing (typing?) 

Thank you all so much for your stories and tips. It's really helped me decide that this time is the last time.

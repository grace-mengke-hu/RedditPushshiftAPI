Replacing an addiction with another..:

Hey guys, been two days stopped smoking after 12 years of smoking around 10-12 cigarettes a day. Feeling strong and good, I can beat it BUT I have literally not stopped eating and snacking and grazing. 

I don’t even really have a sweet tooth yet all I want is chocolate! Also, I’ve noticed that I’m mainlining cups of tea and coffee as well. I’m trying not to beat myself up about it but is there anyone out there with some advice and will this phase pass?

7 Months and counting

I've made it 7 months without a cigarette and boy does it feel great. The worst part is over though I do still feel tempted, especially when others around me smoke. The thought of negating 7 months of progress is what keeps me at bay. It is much more satisfying to say I have been smoke free for 7 months than 5 minutes of satisfaction from a cigarette. For those of you just starting out, the first few weeks are the hardest then it only gets easier!

66 days. Easy

I was with a buddy Monday and after he put his cigarette out I noticed that it didn't affect me at all while he was smoking. Idk why it's so much easier this time than previous times. This time I was ready to quit, and I was, and still am, 100 determined and 100% serious that I'll never smoke another cigarette my while life.

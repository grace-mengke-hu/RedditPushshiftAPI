Insomnia and Chantix

I am on my first week of Chantix, so I am still smoking. But I am having terrible insomnia. I will feel tired, but canâ€™t fall asleep. And if I do fall asleep, I wake up every hour.

I also had some pretty intense anxiety yesterday, but feel much better today.

Anyone else have these side effects? And if so, how long did it take for the side effects to go away?

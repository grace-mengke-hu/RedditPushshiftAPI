Well, I'm finally ready.

Yesterday at 11:00 am (EST), I made the decision that enough is enough, and I'm going to be done with smoking once and for all. I have tried in the past to quit, making it sometimes as long as 8 months, but always falling back into the same old routine. As I get closer to 30, and a regular smoker since 16, I realize now that I have a unique opportunity to take back control of my health while still in my prime (27 currently). I don't want this to be just another 8 month stint, this time it has to be for good. As i read through all the other posts and stories on here, I truly believe that I can give it up once and for all. It starts now.

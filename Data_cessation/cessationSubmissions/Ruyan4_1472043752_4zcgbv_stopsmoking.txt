1 year ago, I thought this day would never come!!

And here it is. I've been cigarette free for a year now. From a packet a day for 18 years and everyday resolves to quit smoking to today where I haven't had a single cig in a year.

I don't even think about them anymore. And to the purists, my apologies, I do vape. But I have no regrets. I've won back my health and someday, when I feel its about time, I will give up vaping too. But I'm never going back to smoking again. Of this I'm sure.

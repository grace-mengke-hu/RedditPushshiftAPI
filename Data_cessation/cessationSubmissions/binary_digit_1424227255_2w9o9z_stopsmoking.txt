I destroyed my pack, and it felt great.

I actually giggled a little bit.  Even now looking at the 15 mangled cigarettes makes me smile.

I'm not normally so open with my personal life, but reading the stories of others here has really helped me.  I figure if I can somehow contribute to that same feeling for others, I should do so.

So if you're on the fence about quitting, and you're looking for advice from strangers, my advice is this: read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking, and as a fun extra measure, after you've smoked your "last cigarette" have some fun and torture that little monster by destroying every smoke left in the pack.

It feels good.  It feels really good.

4 days smoke free and having chest pains

It has been four days since I last smoked.  I just went to the gym to burn off some of the excess energy I have had.  I only managed about 15 minutes on the elliptical until I started having chest pains and difficulty breathing (and I still am) - more so than I did when I was smoking and going to the gym. Is this normal part of quitting? Will this go away soon?

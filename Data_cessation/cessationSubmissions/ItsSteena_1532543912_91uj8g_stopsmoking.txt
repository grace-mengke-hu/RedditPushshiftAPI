Feels suspiciously easy this go round...

After smoking for 20 years since I was a mere kid, I'm on my third day smoke free (I am vaping.) I get mild desires to smoke an actual cigarette. "The Voice" pops into my head about 4 or 5 times a day and tells me, "You could just have one. Have a cigarette to celebrate not smoking cigarettes for three days." It's been easy to ignore, even when I'm in the company of active smokers. I'm starting to get suspicious of how easy this is. It can't be this easy. I've tried and failed to quit so many times. I'm afraid to get my hopes up. Afraid to look cocky in front of everyone I've shared this with because if I fail, they'll just be like, "I thought you quit..." in that amused and pitying tone. Maybe the difference this time around is I wanted to quit. The other times I've quit with other people, and when they fell off the train k used that as an excuse to start up again, too. This time it's for me. I'm just tired of smoking. Tired of stinking. Tired of smashing $2,500 a year into an ashtray. I feel great. Aside from a nose that is running like a faucet and coughing up some gnarly stuff. I used to be just constantly congested...it was just the norm. Now I can absolutely breathe better with all that stuff draining out. I'm just afraid to be too proud of my progress, or overshare it. The terror that I may not succeed this time is my biggest hurdle. Not cravings or overwhelming need to smoke. It's kind of like when you break up with that loser that all of your friends have told you to dump for years. I can't get over my own negative mind, apparently. Any good videos or resources to help with this particular aspect of quitting? How can I be comfortable presently myself as successful to the world? Presenting myself as a non-smoker?

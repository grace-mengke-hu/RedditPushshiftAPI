Busted and disgusted

I don't know what to say... I thought that at 19 days clean I had it beat.  I lost.  I'm pretty drunk right now, but the alcohol is not what created the weakness.  I was not drunk when I broke.  Most likely the thought of getting drunk preambled the need for my fix.  I don't want to admit it but I know it's true.  I know I'll hate myself tomorrow.  For my weakness mentally, and the way I will pay physically.  I had a horrible shit today after I smoked.  I had my regular shit before smoking, then a stringy mess and an upset stomach until I got drunk.  I don't post this to bring anybody down, but to let you know that smoking truly will not bring you any type of satisfaction.  Maybe a bit of troll-brain satisfaction.  Given my current state, I cannot describe the horror that I will face tomorrow.  Hung over with no recourse or reprieve from nicotine.  I need to stop drinking.  I can't control it, much like my relationship with smoking.  I'm glad that reddit has afforded me to admit my shortcomings with a modicum of anonymity.  Thank you, my brothers & sisters.  I truly hope to do better, someday.

My distorted mind

Thanks for this sub, guys. I look forward to getting a badge one day soon. I finally decided to read Allan Carr's book. 

This is amazing. I read:
"When smokers cough it is because their lungs
are trying to dispel cancer-triggering tars and poisons. When they do not cough those tars and
poisons remain in their lungs, and that is when they cause cancer. "

I think:
"Oh my god - why don't I cough when I smoke? It would be better if I coughed."

Not:
"I shouldn't smoke."

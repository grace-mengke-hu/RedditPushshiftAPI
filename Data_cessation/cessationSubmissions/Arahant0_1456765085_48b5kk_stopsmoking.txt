Holy shit . . . Welbutrin works!

I have been trying to quit, and haven't been able to go more than five or six hours without having a panic attack, so I decided to go see my doctor and try Welbutrin. 

I took it for five days to let it build up in my system, then had my last cigarette at five Saturday evening. Let me tell you, friends, this shit fucking works. I'm in full blown withdrawal right now and I don't want a cigarette. I feel a little weird... My stomach is tender, and I'm a little tired, like I've been in a war zone, but the worst of the withdrawals are nearly over. I should wake up tomorrow feeling a hundred times better than today.

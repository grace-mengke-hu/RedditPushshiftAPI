99 days

I quit smoking unplanned and cold turkey 99 days ago and for the first time I am slowly starting to identify as a non smoker/ex smoker, instead if someone that is in the process of quitting. 

Yes, I still miss smoking sometimes - like an old lover that creeps up your mind every now and than, but I know that everything I gained from not smoking I will miss even more if I would start smoking again. And that is what is keeping me, and what will keep me. 

We can do this!! :)

I am now at a point where I feel comfortable repainting my house to get all the smoking stuff out, it makes me very unhappy to look on what smoking did to my place, and how little I cared over the years.

I love brushing my teeth!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed brushing my teeth prior to not smoking. But now that I don't smoke and am not going to go have a smoke after brushing, it's a whole new world. Plus, today I noticed my teeth are getting whiter and that was a nice surprise. Having better breath has been awesome.

Made it a month!

I can honestly say, I never thought I would make it a month. I thought I would crack. I just kept pushing forward. Every day had been a struggle in some way or another. If you're reading this and you're struggling, keep pushing forward. Celebrate every little victory. I smoked for 28 years. If I can go a month, so can you.

From my first 50 I have learned.

Your one and only goal at this moment should be to cope with first 30 days without cigarettes. Don't take any chances. Otherwise you will always be stuck in vicious cycle of quitting and relapsing, in between you will suffer from withdrawal related physical and psychological problems. And life is definitely not worth doing this shit all the time. You are suffering from anxiety and lack of awareness right now, it's just day 5, be patient and avoid getting yourself in rush. Welcome.

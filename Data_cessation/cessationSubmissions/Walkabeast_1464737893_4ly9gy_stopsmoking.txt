Update: Music Fest experience

Well it was as tempting as I expected. Every 5 minutes my friends had a new cig to smoke. A friend of mine even was practically begging us to take some of his cigarettes, since he bought them with a coupon. 

I did cave in though. I had 1 cigarette and I felt so dumb. Watching everyone smoke, and it was the last day of the fest so I had almost made it, but I was drunk and I just wanted to have one. And it was so underwhelming. It was a decent nicotine buzz but it just made all the inner yearning and fantasizing about having just the one cigarette now just an incredibly disappointing experience. Now I feel more over cigarettes than before, since I was still craving them. 

Not sure if I should reset my flair, yes technically I did have a smoke, but I feel it was a more positive outcome and something that needed to happen. If I didn't smoke I'd still be thinking that I "NEED" just that 1 cigarette to make things better. When in reality, you're just gonna be standing there for a bit and your breath is gonna suck.

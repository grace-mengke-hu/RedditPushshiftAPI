Feeling great

I know I am only starting off, but I feel pretty good mentally and physically.  I think last night was my first night NOT dreaming about smoking or buy smokes (LOL). My cravings are low and I think about smoking less and less.  After 25 years of smoking a pack a day I never thought I would be doing this and feeling good about it.  Just thought I would share :)

Is the way I'm feeling normal after quitting?

Good Morning everyone. I new here and have been inspired but all of the stories and support that I've been reading. 

I am 1 week smoke free so far and have been taking Zyban to help. For the first week of taking I felt energized. When my quit day came (last Tuesday), I found it pretty easy to stop and I was able to get past the cravings, and I still felt pretty good. 

This week however, while the cravings are easing, I really feel irritable and moody. Almost to the point where I am looking for something to be mad at with the people I care about the most.

Is that normal / to be expected? Does it usually subside or will I feel this until I am done with Zyban?

Any info or help will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you and keep staying strong! Don't beat yourself up if you falter and have one, just start over and resolve to try harder.

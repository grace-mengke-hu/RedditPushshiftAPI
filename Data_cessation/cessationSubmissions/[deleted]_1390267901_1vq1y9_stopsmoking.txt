One week, coughing made a violent return, but keeping strong.

Yes, one week later, things are alright but I started coughing again, really bad too, like taste-of-metal-bad. Have had cravings for about a day now, but I count to 200 when I get them, seems to work. Also a fair deal of whiskey seems to help.

Dreaming of smoking almost every night, but yesterday I dreamt that I was offered one but turned it down, so that's progress..

I'll keep on fighting and coughing.

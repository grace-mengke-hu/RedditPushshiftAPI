I am free

Today I was watching TV when an ad came on. It was the 57 year old guy, Gerry Collins talking about how he was fighting lung cancer and what he would give to go back to his younger self and tell them to quit.

Usually when these ads air, in the past I've ignored them. Tried not to think about it and move on with my life. Today I watched it.

The ad ends with "Gerry died a week after this was recorded". I broke down. I feel so thankful that I am no longer a smoker and that I have avoided Gerry's fate.

Thank you.

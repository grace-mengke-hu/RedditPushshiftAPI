Prep to quit: Please help me with faith in exercise?

Hello all,

For many reasons I want to quit. Problem is that I love the act. Not more than I hate it, finally, but I also know that this next week isn't feasible. I know my weaknesses & am fine with that. In around 10 days I'll be smoke free, regardless of all else.

So what's the problem? Faith in healing, as in I don't have any. I used to be one hell of an active guy, ~13 years ago. Since then I've been between 5 & 1 pack a day (18 hour shifts on deck = 5 packs a day, sadly).

I can find logistics on "what your body does" & timelines and such stock data, but I'm really concerned since many former smokers I know say they never could get very active again. Most quitters I've come across either didn't smoke as much, or as long, or aren't wanting to turn themselves into a (damaged) version of their former selves.

If there are any links, previous posts, stories of success, I would greatly appreciate the help bolstering my faith as I prep for this difficult task.

Note: I'm moving, spending time with friends/associates, quit my job(s), and finishing summer term before hitting Uni, and smoke a pack & 1/4 a day at the moment.

**TL;DR** I'm preparing to quit, want/will do so, but am looking for help believing that after ~13 years of smoking too much I'll be able to get into shape & adventure actively/heavily in the wilderness again.

Thank you for time & help,

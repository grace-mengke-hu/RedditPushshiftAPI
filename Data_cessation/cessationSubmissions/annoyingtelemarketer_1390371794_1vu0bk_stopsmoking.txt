I can't believe

I made it three days! And counting. Hell yea!  This is amazing. I went from a pack a day to cold turkey. Not gonna lie I tried to quit twice already this year. But I could never make it past the first 24 hours. I'm 22 yo male started at 15 but wasn't super on it until 16 17. I'm so proud of myself. I was able to go out and play poker and drink with friends tonight without a single cigarette. I'm also a recovering drug addict (opiates and cocaine). For me the first day or two were harder then quitting heroin. But now its not too bad. I read an article saying that everytime I do something that included me smoking a cig will cause an intense craving (it does) but if I succesfully get by that it will help rewire my brain to not cause the dreaded feeling of needing a smoke to survive. 

So far its been true. I think failing twice this year helped me realize how bad off I was.

Now realalisticly (spelled that wrong) I just started and won't feel like I've won until 90 days - even then I know I have to expect trouble on occasion. But I believe its possible. And I haven't felt that way in a long time.

I've been subscribed to this sub for over a year and this is my first post. Thank you to everyone who posted. You all have helped in some way. 

To the future (and the next 24 hours )

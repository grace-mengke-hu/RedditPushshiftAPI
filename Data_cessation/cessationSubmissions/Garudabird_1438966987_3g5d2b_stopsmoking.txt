To tell or not to tell?

I'm curious to know how many quitters here are going it alone and how many have spread the word (in the real world). I'm asking because I have kept my quit pretty quiet...I've had so many failed attempts that no one takes me seriously and when I did tell someone at the 3 week point, the response I got was 'oh so you must be pretty close to your next cig, you never go more than a few weeks!'  The comment didn't even really bother me because this time it feels very different to the point that it feels like a non issue, I am not a smoker anymore, end of, I don't feel the need to broadcast it although I am very proud of myself.

So my stop smoking app is suggesting that if there is anyone I haven't told yet that I should do so but I honestly think that most people won't even notice or have much confidence in me so I'm not bothering. Coming here has become my support network and you are all great. So thank you and congrats to all my fellow quitters. I'm celebrating my almost a month by myself, but with you.

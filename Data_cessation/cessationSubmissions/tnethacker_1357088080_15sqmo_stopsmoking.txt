24 hours without smoking - this year i'm trying to finally do it cold turkey

I've tried to quit over the years, always using nicotine inhalers, gum, etc.  but as soon as i tried to stop using them, i started smoking again. 

This year WILL be different as i will replacing my addiction with another new addiction of mine which i started a month ago - gym!

So wish me and others good luck :)

EDIT: I've been a smoker for 15 years so this is really difficult for me
EDIT2: I've been watching Allen Carr videos now for the past few hours and i honestly think that i've been a fool before while trying to quit with the help of nicotine products. There are no nicotine withdrawal symptoms, it's just all in my own head.

Think of the filter

When I get a craving for a smoke, the thing that seems to work for me is not thinking of how great it'll be to finally give in, what works is not thinking of the guilt I'll feel once it's over.

One simple trick is to think of the filter. The disgusting brownish filter that you end up with after smoking a cigarette. Now you have to dispose of it, smoking doesn't seem appealing anymore once you've satisfied the craving, once you're looking at the evidence that you gave in. 

Filters are gross, they're not as appealing as a new and shiny cigarette from your favourite brand, think of them instead of thinking about the action of smoking.

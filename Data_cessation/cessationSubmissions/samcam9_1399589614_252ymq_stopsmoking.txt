6 weeks smoke free except when drinking alcohol.

I've manage to keep smoke free for 6 weeks now and have benefitted greatly. 
However, I do find myself smoking when I drink alcohol, which is one night on the weekends. I smoke about 10 fags in this time. 
Has anyone any tips on how to help stop this? Other than not drinking.....

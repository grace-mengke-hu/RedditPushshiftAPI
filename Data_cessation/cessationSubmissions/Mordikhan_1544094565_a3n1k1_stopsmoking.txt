New to this subreddit and would like some advice to help quit in my particular situation.

I first had a cigarette when I was maybe 12/13. At no point in my life have a smoked every day for an extended period of more than say 5 days on holiday.

I am a social smoker - I dont smoke in a work break, I smoke when I drink mainly. I probably only have a pack a weekend which isnt much but as someone who is playing both rugby and football, notice how it will hit my lungs big time at the beginning of a week after being out and inevitably smoking.

The above sounds like it should be easy to kick but maybe because I am drinking I have real association problems when with others smoking and drinking. If it is unavailable (nowhere to buy and no one else smoking) - it is zero issue.

Almost 30 and just think its time to get rid  yet I have said that for the last 4 years. any advice I would appreciate!

Alcohol not anymore a fear!

I'm so happy! 16 days here, yesterday I went with a friend of mine in a Pub, we had 2/3 beer as usual... I'm managing pretty well my cravings, during the day it's just fine, I'm using an e-cig without nicotine so of course I use it if i want to smoke and I'm ok, happy withouth the cigarettes. 
Anyway until yesterday alcohol was my big problem, every time i hung out with my friends i had a relapse... Here in Italy everyone in their 20's smoke, litterally, everyone. 
Yesterday was the first time i didn't smoke! My firend lighted up 4-5 cigarettes as usual in front of me and something strange happened, i wanted so bad one but the smell was so nasty that i hated it... so it was very easy... I'm so happy!!! I know I'm just on the second week but the alchool was an enormous challenge for me, I smoked for almost 10 years and now I know I can do it!!!! No more puff, no matter what!

Back on the Wagon

So I've now had first hand experience of how 'just having one' drags you back in. Quit for most of October and 'just had one' every couple of hours for the last 6 weeks. 

I was doing really well and I want that again. I'm not looking forward to the struggle, but I am looking forward to the challenge. We're all in this together.... right?

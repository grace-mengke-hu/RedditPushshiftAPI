One week down, a lifetime to go!

This is so freaking exciting! I seriously never thought I would make it this far cold turkey, but it has actually been easier than I thought it would be! Don't get me wrong, some of the cravings have been pretty rough. I have stared wistfully at cigarette butts on the street, I have lingered downwind of smokers outside the bars, and my inner monologue has done straight up gymnastics trying to rationalize *just one more cigarette*. But here I am, still going strong! I think I mostly haven't smoked because the idea of starting over is soooo very daunting. I don't want to lose all the progress I've made. 

But lately, like the last 48 hours, my resolve has gotten kind of shaky. The first few days I was so full of piss and vinegar, there was no chance of me actually smoking. Now I'm starting to have thoughts like "well you've gone a week, you could have ONE.". I squash those thoughts as quickly as I can, but any advice, mantras etc that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for being here, and thanks for listening, I love you guys :)

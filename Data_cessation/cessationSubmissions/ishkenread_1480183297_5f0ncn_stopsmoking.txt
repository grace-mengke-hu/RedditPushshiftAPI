A blackout smoke

I am so disappointed in myself.  Just passed one month smoke free.  Been a terribly difficult time with horrible depression.  Last night I got blackout wasted and took a friends lit ciggerette and smoked it.  I don't remember it at all.  It really sucks knowing there is nicotine in my body.  It doesn't change the fact that I don't want to smoke.  I won't let this relapse break my spirit and my determination to remain a nonsmoker.

Going into day 5, having some psychological and physiological difficulties. Feedback?

**TL;DR: I just don't feel like I've quit yet, and that scares me a bit.**

So to preface, the method for quitting that wound up working for me was using Chantix and Wellbutrin.  I know that medication isn't /r/stopsmoking preferred way to quit, but it's the only thing that has worked for me.

Additional information: I smoked one to one and a half packs a day for around seven years and I have somewhat advanced COPD.  


Physical:

I seem to be coughing much more and producing more phlegm, so much more throat clearing as well.

When I used to take an unusually deep breath I could feel some pain in the upper portion of my lungs*, since then said pain has moved up to the bottom of my throat.

Psychological:

I still *feel* like I'm a smoker, just a smoker who isn't smoking.  (Those who have been through AA will know what I'm talking about.)  Does this mindset pass with time?  Is there anything I can do to cultivate a non-smoker mindset?

*The lung pain mentioned above gave the belief that I had taken an extra deep, healthy breath and I knew that because my lungs (felt like they had) expanded farther than usual; now that I don't have that pain I feel like I'm not breathing as deeply.  Did anyone else experience this?  Does it pass and can I help it along?

The Chantix and the Wellburtin have really done a lot to help curb the physiological cravings which have allowed me to say "No, I don't need it." and go forward.  I guess... I just don't feel like I've quit yet, and that scares me a bit.

Thanks in advance, and thanks for being around for the support either way.  :D

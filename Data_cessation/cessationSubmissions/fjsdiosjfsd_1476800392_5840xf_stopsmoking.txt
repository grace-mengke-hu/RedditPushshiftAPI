Two weeks!

This sub was such a huge help in the first week but I haven't been back for a bit, so I thought I would check in to let everyone know I hit the two week mark last night!

It's been hard, and I'm still worried about relapsing. But I can say that the thoughts of smoking decrease more and more. A week ago I was thinking about smoking almost all day, or at least it was in the back of my mind. Now, it occurs to me maybe three distinct times a day when my brain is still conditioned to think "a cigarette would be good right now."

Stay strong everyone! Not smoking wins over smoking every day.

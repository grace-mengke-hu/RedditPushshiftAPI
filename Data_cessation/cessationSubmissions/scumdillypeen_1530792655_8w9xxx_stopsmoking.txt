Feeling hopeless...

I've been a smoker for only a few years now. I've quit before. Last year for 7 months. I just stopped back then and it wasn't hard. Six weeks back I listened to Allan Carr's book and quit for 7 days until something traumatic happened and I went back. I've listened to the book 5 more times since and made it 10 more days total. 

I'm worried that I wasted my chance with this book and now it doesn't work for me. I still have that doom feeling in spite of all the logic I'm well aware of. I can't get the psychological aspect down anymore. Has anyone else had this problem. Ive quit again as of today but I'm worried it won't last long.

Please help.

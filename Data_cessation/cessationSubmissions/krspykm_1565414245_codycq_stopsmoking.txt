Day 2 no nicotine - headaches are getting worse

So today marks my day 2 of completely no Nicotine. I've switched to juul for 2 weeks and lost it 2 days ago and it made me realize that it's a sign that i should quit nicotine at all. So far so good, no cravings for cigarettes yesterday and today but gosh the headaches are getting worse. 

Just to put it out there, i have been smoking for 9years.

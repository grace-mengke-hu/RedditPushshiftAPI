Trouble breathing?

Anyone else struggle to breath? I feel like I'm making weird noises through my nose it's the most awful thing. It could be down to hey-fever but I'm not sure it feels like it could be the damage smoking has done. I'm only 23 which makes it worse, hope (well I wouldn't wish this on anyone but you catch my drift) any of you might have some expierence.

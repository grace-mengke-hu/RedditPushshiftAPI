Been over a year, right now I could really use one.

There are moments where I get really antsy, where I just can't sit still. I would go out and have a smoke, but I quit over a year ago. Still, I still am right now wanting to have a smoke to calm down. T_T The only thing I can do when in this type of mood is eat and pace back and forth until it subsides.

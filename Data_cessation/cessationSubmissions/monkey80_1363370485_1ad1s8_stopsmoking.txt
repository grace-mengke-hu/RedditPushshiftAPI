Stay Strong. 

I recently went to a bar that shockingly still allows smoking inside. Nearly everyone there was lighting up. The entire place was a cloud of smoke. I could barely stand to be inside. It became truly noticeable when I walked outside, and could smell the smoke on my clothes, in my hair. I just couldn't believe that I used to enjoy smoking. 

For all of you out there starting out, or having a rough patch, stay strong. Your day will come,you too will be shocked that you once enjoyed smoking. Right now it's difficult to comprehend  it seems like that smoke will be only thing to make you feel better but it's not. 

You might be gaining some weight trying to giving it up, I sure did. But the weight will come off, when you start running again and can't believe how well you can breath. The next time you get a cold you won't cough up a lung worth of mucus. In fact it will take you half the time to get better. I won't even get started with the money part! 
You'll have rough days, stressful moments, but smoking isn't the answer. It's not even a temporary solution, it's a distraction. 

Stay strong you can make it through this. Your life is better without cigarettes.

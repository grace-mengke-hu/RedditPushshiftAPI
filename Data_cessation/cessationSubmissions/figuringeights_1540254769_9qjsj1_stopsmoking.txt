My dad cant breathe

I was a smoker for 15years. Heavily addicted. Haven't bought pack, though I've had the occasional cigarette. It's not good. That is all just to say I understand why he is where he is. 

My dad has always struggled with smoking, though he has successfully quit a number of times himself. He wasn't smoking for a long time until my mom had a very difficult back surgery in August. That triggered him to stress and buy a pack. The other day I learned that he was smoking 2-3 a day which he considers "sneaking a few". I didn't press it too much on him, just a light "dad, I need you around for later". 

Now he is in the hospital. He can't breathe. This isn't the first time this has happened. But now they might actually be checking him in. I'm so scared. I blame myself for not helping him and pushing him more. I really do need him around. I love him.

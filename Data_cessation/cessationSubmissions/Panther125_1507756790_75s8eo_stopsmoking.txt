Stopped shisha smoking

around 14 days ago I decided to call a quit on my few years long habit of shisha smoking. Problem is, that I was easily able to smoke few shishas A DAY (which is hell of a lot), habit which I developed during home office working. I never had any health problems and this decision was based purely on the fact that it started to eat too much of my budget.

I had no physical withdrawal symptoms at all but let me tell you the psychicals are giving me hell. Problem is I am not forced to do so, I just kind of wanted, to save money for better things. 

how do you deal with the feelings of "Aaah, what a nice evening, it is warm, dark and quiet, fireplace is burning... now all it needs is a shisha..." Not that I am breaking, but it just kills a mood :(

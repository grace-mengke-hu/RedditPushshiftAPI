300 days!

Cannot believe that it has been 300 days! I never thought I would be able to quit but, when you really decide to do it, read Allan Carr, and get all of the amazing support from this site, it becomes a reality. If you are just beginning, it really does get easier. I cannot imagine having a cigarette at all. You can do it! Kick that nicotine monster in the ass and get on with life without dragging it along!

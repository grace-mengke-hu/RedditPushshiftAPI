So I was a smoker for 887 days: 2.41 years, £4 a day = £3548!?! What the hell, I'm never going to get that money back...

So I reversed the calculations and requested a badge with my "start" date just to check it out. For argument's sake 20th August 2012 was the day I started smoking, and I averaged about £4 a day in cigarettes. Today is my day one, and I still can't believe I could have saved £3548 from not smoking. 

The truly unsettling thing though, is knowing that if someone had asked me to quit for a billion dollars I'd have done it right away, no questions asked. But when it came down to my own health on the line - having healthy teeth, gums, lungs, skin etc - I didn't give a shit about them and smoked. That's just absurd: health is priceless, I shouldn't need to have money as a motivation to stop smoking if I'm regaining something you can't put a price on! How sickening is that, to know that you'd quit the habit easily if someone paid you to do it, but you wouldn't do it yourself for your own good without a struggle?

So the £3548 I've lost, that's in the past now. Hopefully I haven't done any lasting damage to my body (2.41 years isn't much). Previous self, I forgive you for smoking cigarettes. Present self, I thank you for quitting today. Future self, I look forward to meeting you as a nonsmoker.

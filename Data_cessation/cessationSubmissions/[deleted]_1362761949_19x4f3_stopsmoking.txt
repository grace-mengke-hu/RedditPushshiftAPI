Goodbye Cigarette. 

I first met her two years ago.  Things really didn't click back then and I was pretty uncomfortable around her.  Soon, the more we hang out the more I'm used to her.  I hung out around her long enough to the point where I realize I cannot go through a day without seeing her. She's always there for me when I'm depressed or having troubles.  Eventually, things got dull with her and she seemed to not care when I was having a tough time. I thought maybe I should just quit her right now before it turns into an unhealthy relationship. So, a month ago, I decided to suddenly break up with her with out telling her a word.  Then I found weed, haha just kidding.

Thoughts on habitual urges, like morning, eating eating, getting in the car, etc...

I have personified that thought whenever it comes up.  For example,  I do my morning routine  (shit shower shave) and my brain immediately jumps to the next ritual, coffee and a cigarette.  Now I may be special, because I actually quit both caffeine and nicotine on Monday, but as soon as the thought enters my mind, and I think we all know the feeling that follows, I immediately put a face on that thought, and chop its fucking head off, or beat it to death, or torture it.  I actually grab onto the thought willfully and don't let it slip back into my brain.  I then toy with it like a cat toys with it's prey, until it's dead.
  
I'm getting morbid about this shit, but I've been dreaming so hard, feeling so motivated, and if I have to fantasize about killing an old version of myself a few times a day, so fucking be it.
  
Good luck everyone,

Mr. Fucker

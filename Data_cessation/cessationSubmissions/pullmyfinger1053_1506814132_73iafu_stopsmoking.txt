The Smokers Flu is no joke!

So I am currently 6 days and 20.5 hours into quitting smoking again. This is probably the longest I have been without nicotine in years. I decided to bin my ecig as I realised if I wanted to stop for good, I had to go full turkey. 

Thing is, at day 6 I have been struck down with some monster flu symptoms. Both my nostrils are blocked and I can't breath for shit. Has anyone else had this experience during their quit? Please tell me it gets better soon. I'm still going strong though, not one more puff, not now, not ever!

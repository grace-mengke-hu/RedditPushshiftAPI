After three years of no smoking, I’ve really been struggling.

It all started when I bought a vape thinking it would help. It’s been a year of vaping on and off, nicotine lozenges, patches and I went and bought a pack yesterday and then another today. It’s been harder getting off nicotine this time around. Much harder. I just can’t believe it. I mean I can, I’ve been dipping my toe in the nicotine pool. It’s a dangerous slope. I have such an emotional attachment to smoking. I suppose we all do on some level.

I’m finishing this pack today. Buying patches tomorrow and starting over. I’m also going to visit you all more often. I need to get my head straight.

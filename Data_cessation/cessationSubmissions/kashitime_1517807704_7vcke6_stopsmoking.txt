Thinking of going cold turkey again. Is there any way to lessen/weaken the withdrawal symptoms?

I recall having the worst nightmares and the early onset of withdrawal fever before I succumbed and went back to smoking, during my first attempt at quitting.

I’m determined to try again, but I’d like to ask, are there any preemptive actions I can take to avoid the nightmares and sickness? I’m not sure if I can face them at full force given the time and work I need to put into my classes at uni. 

In hindsight, it was those withdrawal symptoms that made quitting hard for me. It was so easy to just have a cigarette and sleep assured that I wouldn’t be seeing serial killers in my dreams. 

If I taper down by lessening my cigarettes from a pack a day to zero, will the withdrawal symptoms be weaker?

I *will* quit. I will quit!!! One day I’ll post here and be happy that I quit!!!

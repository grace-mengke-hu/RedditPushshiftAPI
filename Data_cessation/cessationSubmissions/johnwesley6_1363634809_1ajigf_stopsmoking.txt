Separating anxiety from real side effects.



As someone who has some issues with anxiety I think that at times I convince myself of things that aren't truly there.
I started to have anxiety yesterday and as the day wore on I ended up on line freaking myself completely out about the chantix that I'm taking , now on day four.

The anxiety and worry has still been there today and now I'm debating what to do. Are these side effects from chantix( dizziness, vertigo, feeling like I'm going to pass out ) or is it stumpy my anxiety trying to control me

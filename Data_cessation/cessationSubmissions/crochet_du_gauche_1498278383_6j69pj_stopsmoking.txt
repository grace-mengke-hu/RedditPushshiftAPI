Which day was the worst for you?

I've been smoke free for about 24 hours after smoking about a half-pack a day. The physical and mental symptoms are pretty bad... complete inability to concentrate basically making me useless at work, severe fidgeting and restlessness, really bad cough and sore throat.

I'm wondering if I can expect worst in the second and third days? If so I just want to be prepared. What day in the first week was the worst for you when you quit?

Dealing with stress

Found out my dad has cancer again, my husband is quiting his job today but already has another job lined up so that is not so bad. Just might miss a pay check and since I am a stay at home mom for a little one it can be a bit hard missing a paycheck. We are losing 2 tenants (we rent rooms out of our home). We still have not found a replacement for the rooms. I am stressed....but I still don't want to smoke a cigarette...so I at least have that going for me....

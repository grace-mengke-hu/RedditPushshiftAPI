Moment of truth

I started smoking exactly 1 year ago. And I said that I would smoke for a year to see how hard it can be to quit.

Bad idea, I know. But I am a very curious person and wanted to experience this myself before having an opinion about it.

I was wrong, smoking is very addicting. I enjoyed it though. But now I have to quit.

Today was my last cigarette. 3 hours ago. Now I wil never ever do this shit again. Good luck to anyone.

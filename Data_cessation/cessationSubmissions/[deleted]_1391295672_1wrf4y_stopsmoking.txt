That's all folks!

Had my last cigarette 16 hours ago and I'm holding up fantastically! The cravings are there but keep getting told to fuck off :) I've also decided to abstain from alcohol for the month of February to make things a little easier since I tend to smoke like a chimney when I'm drunk. I'm really looking forward to being done with smoking, I've been doing it for 7 years and it's time for me to quit.

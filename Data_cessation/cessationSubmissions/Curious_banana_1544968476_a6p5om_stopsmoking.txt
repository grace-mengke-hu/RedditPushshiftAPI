Watch a game at a shisha/hookah bar?

I can't believe it, I'm fucking doing it! Rarely count the days passed anymore, zero cravings around smokers; however almost lost my shit at day 73 when I was super stressed out about an exam but venting to this community kept me sane. Anyhow, finished with the most important final of the term this morning and I've been invited to watch a football game at a shisha(hookah) bar; and I mean with the "cool" college kids. Would you go if you were in my place or decline?

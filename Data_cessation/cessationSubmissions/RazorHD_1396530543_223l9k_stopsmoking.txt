I'm done.

I'm 31 and been smoking for 6 years. A pack a day for the last 4.  I'm done.  I have fellow smokers dropping left and right.  Not to mention the growing feeling that I'm just not wanted in society as a smoker.  Health number one, money for the second, and lastly, social reasons.  All good motivators! I'll keep it here.

How do I handle stress now?! [rant, suggestions welcome]

I used to smoke when I was stressed; It was my go-to thing when life seemed to be spiraling out of control.  I could take a moment, sit out on the balcony, and just think about nothing.



But since I quit (and I don't regret it for a second, nope nope nope!) I've been so stressed out I've been crying every second day.  We have to pack up our apartment and stage it for showing, I have one last order to fill before we pack up my workstation and my embroidery machine is messing up, I have my sister's wedding this summer AND my wedding next year to plan for . . .  I just feel like things are piling up and I have no way to get rid of the stress.  Even my kitten, Ostara, is getting anxious because of how I've been reacting to the nicotine withdrawal :(



Is there anything I can do to relieve my stress?  I've tried screaming into my pillow, but that's only a short-term solution.

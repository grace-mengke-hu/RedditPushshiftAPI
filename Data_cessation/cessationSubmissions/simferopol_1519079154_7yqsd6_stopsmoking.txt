10 days in - can't concentrate, cant focus

I have been lurking this subreddit for a few weeks now and I just wanted to thank everyone here for the kindness and support that everyone seems to share and provide to former and soon-to-be former smokers like myself and others. Thank you.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same degree of impairment in their ability to concentrate/focus after quitting smoking as I have. I'm basically non-functional when it comes to complex mental tasks. I was working as a web developer a few months before I quit. Now that I have stopped smoking, I can't look at code anymore without loosing focus. It is really hard to think a problem through. I also feel very little motivation when it comes to doing any sort of mental tasks and when I do start it feels dreadful. Finally, when i try to read a book, my mind will wander. My eyes will read a paragraph but my mind wont understated it so I will have to re-read it again. This can happen several times with a single paragraph. The reading material is not hard and should be easy to read. Has anyone else experienced similar issues? 

I've smoked half a pack a day on average for 8 years.

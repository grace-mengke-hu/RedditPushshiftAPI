I need some help, I dont know how to do it

Hey guys, I try to make it quick: I stopped already a couple of times, the longest was 3 months, then I begann again because of a couple of beers on the weekend. Now I dont drink any alcohol at all anymore and want to stop smoking next this week on saturday, because I have a 2 week vacation. So now to my problems, maybe you could give you thougts on it? So my biggest part of stopping smoking is that I have always access to cigarettes and there is no way I can not get them if I really want. So I am always thinking about this "one" cigarette that will just make my withdrawl a little less painful. Then I am really into the smoking brakes, I love the 5 minutes of doing nothing but "breathing". I also dont bother thinking about my health problems but im terrified of lung cancer and to be honest I feel like I would still smoke if I had the money to spare. Then there is the habit of always smoking and no app, no gum, no fingerplaythingy is helping me against it, in these moments it is just me and the urge and nothing else. Then there is the withdrawl in itself, I get pretty manic on withdrawl. I lose a bit my sense of reality, I get anger issues and it all feels like I am sleepwalking all the time. I begin to count seconds and minutes till the withdrawl ends, and it gets harder the slower times is going. The last times I stopped smoking I always quit cold turkey and I withstand the urges, now I feel like I cant do it anymore. It feels like three days to a week is an extreme timeframe of withstanding these urges, the pain and the  nervousness. Do you have any thoughts about this? I am 100% sure I need help in this journey :)

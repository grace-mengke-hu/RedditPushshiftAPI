Three days in and wondering: How long until you stopped feeling like you should be having a cigarette all the time?

I didn't even smoke that much! Before 3 days ago I averaged around 5 or 6 per day. I swear I want to smoke every 10 minutes.

At what point did your mind finally accept that you're not a smoker anymore?

After Another Saturday Night Outside by Myself...

After I moved to New York, I lost all of my friends who smoke from the last city I was in.  I went outside by myself every time to smoke, while my friends were inside wondering why I do it!  I dealt with their passive remarks and small quips about how I was the only one, blah, blah, and thought they were inconsiderate.  

After last Saturday night, a great night out with essentially everyone that is awesome in my life, and I smoked about 15 cigs.  Woke up with the worst hangover, stank mouth... and did what I usually do after a long night of drinking I sit on the couch with reddit!  

It is time to kill the stank mouth and the hangover of guilt!  I didn't smoke yesterday, but I didn't really make the decision until about 9pm.  This is when I quit smoking, March 18th 2013!  I will be around here quite often.  

Thanks everyone!

Help/Advice

Quit faithfully for about 5 months, from a heavy smoker. Quit using chantix. Moved in with a friend whos a smoker and noticed i went from taking one of his once in a while, to now at least 1-3 a day. Starting to get cravings back. Any tips/advice to get myself back into shape and lose those cravings im starting to get?

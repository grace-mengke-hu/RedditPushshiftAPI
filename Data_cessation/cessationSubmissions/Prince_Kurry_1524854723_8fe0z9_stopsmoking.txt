Real Smoking alternative

Hey guys, I don’t know if this is weird or not but I  bought a pack of cigarettes when I got to college because I was always curious. I smoked a couple and it was enjoyable but I feel like I could feel it affecting my body a lot (or maybe it was just all in my head I don’t know) so I didn’t even finish the pack before I threw it away.

And even before, during, and after I had the pack I realized the appeal of it (atleast for me).
Sure the little bit of nicotine was nice. But what I really loved was pulling one out, lighting it up, putting it up to my mouth and just smoking.
I didn’t like the awful taste, and I didn’t really care for the nicotine hit at all.

So my question is, is there any alternative that closely resembles the act of smoking a real cig? Preferably not too expensive.

I’m always tempted just to go out and buy a pack but I know it’s not worth it in the long run

Wow, day 28 was really tough.  Surprised me.

Cravings had consistently been getting easier and easier to dissipate, and then all of a sudden yesterday, despite all my intellectualizing, they were VERY strong.  I didn't cave, but I came a lot closer -- got a lot more wobbly -- than I had in at least a week.  Was a little humbling!

This is one hell of a process.  Can't let your guard down for a moment!  I will not succumb!  Yeesh.
 
EDIT: should have said day 29 in title

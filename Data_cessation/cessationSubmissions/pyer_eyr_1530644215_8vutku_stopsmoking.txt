Slowing down from half a pack a day

I've been smoking for the past 6-7 months. Recently increased to Kamel Red's 100's. It's been interfering with my sleep, since I get up up to smoke at night. It takes me around 2-3 days to get through pack. 

Yesterday I smoked only three all day. Today It's 2:00 pm and I've had 1 marlboro light. I'm getting cravings, and my throat feels like something is dancing inside it. 

I normally only get a craving when I'm alone, and I'm often alone.

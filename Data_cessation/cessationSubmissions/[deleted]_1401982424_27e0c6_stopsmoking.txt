Day fucking 1

Been smoking for almost 5 years now (24). I almost never smoke during the day, but when I get home from work I start drinking and just fucking blast cigs until I go to sleep. To be totally honest it is probably a symbiotic addiction with alcohol as well. 

My family would be so disappointed in me if they knew. Both my grandfathers died of lung cancer and both my parents have made me promise them I wouldn't smoke (when they found out a few years ago that I had). I live and work fairly far from my them, but I am constantly feeling guilty about lying. I get horrible dreams sometimes about them finding out; it really is the biggest source of anxiety in my life. 

I love the way it feels to be drunk and chain smoke, but I am afraid I am wasting my life. Today I am going to to try and get serious about this before I hurt myself and my relationship with my family. 

So just wanted to get that off my chest, any support would help a lot I think. Thanks.

"Casual Smoker"

Hi.. New here! I rarely smoke anytime other than the weekends when I'm drinking. That made me feel like quitting for good would be easier but I don't think so now. I'm going to have to avoid to much drinking in the beginning in order to also avoid smoking! Aahhhhh! 

Anyway, I just got back from vacation and was drinking everyday and I did not have one the whole time! I am only on my 6th day of not smoking but that was something that felt good!  Woo hoo!

Now back to reality where I am around smokers and drinkers often... I got this!

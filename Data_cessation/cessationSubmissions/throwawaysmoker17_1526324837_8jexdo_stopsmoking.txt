Day 295: Turned 18 and finished finals!

So I don’t love calling attention to myself but today’s my 18th birthday and my 295th consecutive day of not smoking, and I just turned in the last term paper of my freshman year of college! Kinda weird that my first act as a 17 year old was probably to smoke a cigarette like I did first thing every day and my last act as a 17 year old was to polish off something I was really proud of! Yay not smoking!

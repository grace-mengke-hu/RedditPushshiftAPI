Look for someone that conquered smoking AND alcoholism.

I'm completely a nonsmoker now, but since the time I quit my drinking gradually increased to the point that I feel it's a problem that I need to deal with before it fucks my life up.

Just wondering what similarities there are to quiting smoking and drinking.  AA is not an option for me.  Seems that's the majority of the advice I was given at r/alcoholism.  Even though I explained that it wouldn't help.  I'm open to other literature.  I'm currently reading Allen Carr's book on controlling alcohol.  His book for smoking is the main reason I was able to quit, so I have high hopes he can help with this as well.

Any advice or helpful experiences would be appreciated.  Thanks.

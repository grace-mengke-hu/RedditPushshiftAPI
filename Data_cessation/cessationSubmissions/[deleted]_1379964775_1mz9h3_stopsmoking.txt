Dealing with new stresses

Day 130 but damn with school starting up and numerous issues I haven't taken care of during the summer are now all adding up. I'm beginning to stress out from everything and all I keep thinking about is smoking. I know the answer is to not smoke but these damn urges are recurring more and more. I love this subreddit as a great source to vent.

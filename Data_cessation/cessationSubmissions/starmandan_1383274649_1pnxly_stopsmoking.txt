Wife wants to quit but doesn't want my help.

I've recently discovered that my wife has been smoking "off and on" for the past 18 years without my knowledge. She has now stated that she wants to quit but has flat out refused to allow me to show any amount of support, encouragement, or allow me to inquire as to how she is progressing only saying that she can do this on her own and that I just need to "trust" her. Of course that "trust" is a bit of an issue for me as I knew that she smoked when we were dating and after expressing my concerns about it she vowed to quit 18 years ago and that apparently didn't happen. It seems to me that she is saying: I will quit in my own time, I may not quit at all, and my smoking habit is none of your business. Any advice?

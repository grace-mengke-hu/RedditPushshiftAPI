Cravings after one month

I went out tonight for a $1 pint special for an hour followed by 3 hours of happy hour specials. Needless to say I got pretty intoxicated! Surprisingly, after approximately 10 beers I have not craved one cigarette! Smoke has been coming into the bar and Iâ€™ve walked past several smokers but literally no craving at all. I feared the worst and was prepared going into tonight but let this be an inspiration to all, and just know it does get better!

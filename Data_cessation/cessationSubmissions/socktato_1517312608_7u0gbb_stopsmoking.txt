One Month Down

36 y/o, ~17 year, moderate smoker here. 

Haven’t smoked in a month and minus some wine with dinner during restaurant week, haven’t drank in about a month either.  

Gonna ride this good feeling and stay off the sauce til I think I can do it without being tempted to bum from someone.  

Keep fighting the good fight, everyone!

Day 2. So far it's not bad at all.

I've been smoking for 6 years, about a pack a day.  I stopped yesterday and had a few times where i really wanted one, but haven't caved yet.  So far it's actually pretty easy.  I've tried to quit several times before but had no luck.  But this time I feel different about it.  I don't want to smoke anymore, whereas before part of me still enjoyed it.  Now I don't enjoy it.  I don't want to smoke.  I'm not an ex smoker and I'm not "trying" to quit, I just don't smoke. i'm a non smoker

My dad quit cold turkey in march after 40 years of smoking.  So.. I don't really have any excuses to not quit

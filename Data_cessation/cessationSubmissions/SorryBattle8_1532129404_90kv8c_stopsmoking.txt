Internal conflict about quitting

I want to quit smoking.  I've been a smoker for 8 years.  It's expensive, I'm tired all the time, it affects my job (I have a side business of pet sitting and most people don't want a smoker walking their dog), When spending time with family I'm constantly planning when I'll be able to smoke which is embarrassing and stresses me out.  I just skipped a family vacation because it involved a 9 hour drive with my brothers and I knew I'd be miserable the entire time.  But at the same time I like smoking.  I love waking up with a glass of water and a cigarette and then having another one with the coffee when it's done brewing.  I like listening to music and driving with a cigarette. I like the habit and the familiarity.  I know I've got a really bad addiction problem but I feel like I'll fail if part of me still wants to smoke. Like I'm planning on quitting so I can finally afford my own place but, and I'm sorry for how stupid this sounds but it's how I feel, what's the point if I can't do one of the things I most enjoy doing?

You guys have been awesome in my journey to self-improvement!

I quit smoking almost 2 years ago, and this sub has helped me through some of the worst times. 

Thank you to everyone and the best of luck to everyone on their journey to self-improvement, but iâ€™m un-subbing from here to focus on the other areas in my life that I need to improve on. 

You can do this! Not one puff....ever again.

Quit two days ago...what are some things to keep my mind off smoking?

I quit smoking yesterday morning after being a relatively heavy smoker for about 4 years. I'm keeping myself from buying another pack but all I find myself thinking about is smoking just one more cig before I stop. Any advice on what to keep myself busy with to keep my mind off smoking?

Day Zero: I'm dreading the craving I know awaits me in the morning

So I just had my last cigarette and after so many failed attempts, I'm not telling anyone I'm quiting. I don't want to disappoint anyone any more. Heck, my husband just past 2 years smoke free. I've never really wanted to quit but now I need to quit. Children are around the corner and I refuse to even try to get pregnant while I still smoke. Anyways, please feel free to leave me some encouraging words to wake up to because that first smoke of the day has always been my weakness. 

To everyone on this long and painful road, we can do this, we just need to do it together because nonsmokers just don't understand the power of nicotine.

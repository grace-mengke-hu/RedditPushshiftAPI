I lost my copy of Easyway...anyway of finding a digital copy?

So during my move I lost my copy and I don't feel like debuying a paper copy. I read through it once but I'm in a better spot in my life and I feel it's time to quit smoking for good this time. I want to run again, I want my skin to heal and my body to feel energetic not to mention the saving at 6.75 a pack I'm ready to quit! I'm 27, fat, and I hate stairs cause I feel heavy and winded walking up them. I'm just ready to be a non smoker.

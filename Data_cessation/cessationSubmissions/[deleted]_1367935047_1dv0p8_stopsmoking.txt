First time trying to quit.

I've been smoking for about half a year now and I'm trying to stop. 
I've started the usual way, friends did it and I just "wanted to try it because there's no way I'm gonna get addicted", completely ignoring the dangers of addiction. 
I'm 16 years old which means I am not even allowed to smoke. A few weeks ago, I told my parents about this since everybody in my family smoked, my sister included who just turned 15 this year. Afterwards, it went downhill even more since I was just smoking in between lessons in school before, but then my parents granted me access to the tobacco they use.
I've gone from "Once or twice every two weeks" to about 1 or 2 hours in between each cigarette. 
There was a time when smoking wasn't that bad, when I was with friends, even when I was lovesick or simply feeling bad, I smoked a cigarette and life wasn't that bad.
But now it's just a huge thing that bothers me. I'm not even all that concerned about my health. It bothers me because when I don't smoke, I'm less capable of concentrating and doing even simple work.
Although my girlfriend says she doesn't mind at all, I don't think kissing somebody right after a cigarette is all that pleasant.  And I want the feeling of shame after each cigarette to go away. Right after I smoke, it's easy to say "Ewww, that was disgusting, I'm never gonna do that again", but after a few hours, it gets me again. I've already tried to quit a few weeks ago, got up to three days without and then gave in again. I haven't been a day without since. I've played with the thought of quitting quite often but after a while of being without cigarettes, it's like my mind simply changes. As if my willpower is getting bent by the addiction. 

Is there any advice you can give somebody who's trying to quit for the first time? Although I am 100% serious at the moment, I have no idea how to stay strong. 
I'd really, really appreciate any sort of help since I obviously can't do it just alone.

Non physical craving questions

This is my first time successfully quitting (only smoked 3 years but a pack plus a day) and I've noticed that in the last few weeks I never crave nicotine, infact I hate the smell (smokers in the house I live) but something about the actual act of it tempts me sometimes, was curious if anyone had any tips to avoid any possible relapses. Thank you all very much

Trying to quit again

22F here, been smoking regularly since I was 19. Tried my first cig when I was 18 but never got the buzz until someone had to teach me how to inhale properly. I honestly can’t remember the longest I’ve gone without a cig since then. It isn’t even about the high bc it’s been several months since I used to be able to feel a buzz, but rather the little routine, the silver lining of my boring day. I suffer from depression and anxiety and though it hasn’t been bad recently, I’m pretty sure I’ve been experiencing anhedonia for a long ass while, which would motivate me to smoke more despite not feeling a buzz.

Was broke yesterday, so I took that opportunity to try to quit. I’m doing it more so to stop burning out my dopamine receptors, improve my sense of smell and try to fix what I’m pretty sure is a twisted artery in my neck (messed it up by contorting my body a lot while laying down and constantly carrying around two bags while commuting). I also didn’t want to go to my next physical and get reprimanded or some crap, so that’s another motive as well as my impending dentist visit.

Honestly, I was never worried about the risk of cancer. Growing up, I kinda figured since cancer was so prevalent in my family that it was inevitable. I’m more worried about strokes and the following neurodegenerative issues that follow that (also, I’d really like to keep my teeth in their nice condition). 

Wish me luck.

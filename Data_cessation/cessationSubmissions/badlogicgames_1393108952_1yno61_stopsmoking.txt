7 Days - How i got this far

I've been lurking here for a while and found this to be a nice community. What helps me most is reading the battle stories of others around here. I thought i'd give back a little by recording my experience here as well.

I've been a 20/d smoker for around 13 years, never tried to quit as i actually enjoyed it. It was a big part of my life. Then a relative was hit by lung cancer and i reconsidered my stance. The day before he was admitted to the hospital for his first treatment was the last day i smoked. This was exactly 7 days or 168 hours ago. Here's what happened during those 7 days.

**Day 1**: sunday morning, my first cig-free morning. I used to smoke 2 immediately after getting up. Not this sunday. It actually worked out pretty well. Later that day we had a family meet up at a restaurant. Everything was a trigger, from getting out of my car after a 20 minute ride, to finishing my meal, to being a bit bored with conversations and so on. This continued after we were back home. My usual habit is to smoke one on the patio immediately after entering the flat. Went to bed, noticed i didn't smell like smoke, which was a plus. Rough night, lots of sweating and waking up every few hours. Glad it wasn't a work day.

**Day 2**: monday, first day at work without cigs. I was expecting a complete breakdown and that was what essentially happened. I could not concentrate at all, i had all kinds of pains, and i was starting to worry about my health. There were even more triggers at work than in the restaurant the day before. After work, i went playing table tennis, a habit i started earlier this year. I went in a total train-wreck and came out ecstatic. I had an immense amount of excess energy, i haven't felt that great in ages. The night was still exhausting, just like the first night.

**Day 3**: went to the doc first thing in the morning to kill any and all worries concerning my health. Doc took 20 minutes of her time and listened. She refereed me to a lung specialist for whom i got an appointment the next day. After the doc i went to work, and i felt only marginally better than the day before. Cravings and worries kept me stressed out the entire day. Back home from work i went running, another habit i started earlier this year. I was hoping for a positive surprise, but instead i had one of the worst runs in a while. I guess the constant stress and fear the last few days took a toll. At least i smelled good (after a shower), and kept smelling good for the rest of the night.

**Day 4**: went to the lung specialist, extremely worried. I went through a complete lung check, from capacity measurement, to allergy tests to x-raying. Everything was fine, so i could strike this issue from my list of worries. Before going to work i got myself a bag of nuts. I wanted to better cope with my triggers, e.g. taking breaks at work, and i figured having something to chew on that doesn't make me super fat is an OK idea. Worked out OK, there were quite a few episodes of craving, but nothing the nuts and willpower couldn't get me through. Turns out i had a lot less issues back in the flat than at work.

**Day 5**: another day at work. I was finally able to concentrate a bit better, though i'd estimate my productivity to be at 60% of my normal level. I tried to hide the fact that i stopped smoking from my co-workers, but i guess some noticed that i actually don't smell like shit after my hourly 5 minute breaks. It's putting a bit of pressure on me, however silly that may sound. The day went pretty well, and i almost felt normal.

**Day 6**: the morning was filled with paper work for the tax and social security department and visits to their offices. Such situations are usually a huge trigger for me, but i actually didn't think about smoking while dealing with this (or at least i don't remember it). In the afternoon the woman and i went out to some traditional clothing store to see if we could find something for our wedding in August. Another big trigger. I hate shopping, so usually i get outside after 10 minutes, using my smokes as an excuse. The whole thing went better than expected. I guess having a run shortly before going there also helped. We went to a pub after shopping, having burgers with the family. Non-smoking area of course. All was well. A pretty good day.

**Day 7**: today. It's the first day the cravings really took center stage. I was battling my addicted brain all day, ignoring all the begging and reasoning why a cig would be amazing. Instead of minute long cravings my brain was nagging me constantly. I guess i didn't keep myself occupied enough, just been laying around on the couch, browsing the web and watching silly movies. Didn't do any exercise either. Overall not the best day out of the 7, but also not the worst. Note for sunday: do stuff!

What worked for me so far:

* If you are a bit of a hypochondriac and decide to stop smoking, **get yourself checked by a doc**. Puts your mind to rest so you can focus on battling the addiction.
* **Start exercising before you stop smoking**. It's an awesome way to measure the changes that happen to you. Prepare for setbacks.
* **Stop on a weekend**. It's easier to survive the first 1-2 days that way. Had i started on a work day i'm sure i'd have relapsed within a few hours.
* **Do not avoid your triggers**. Eventually you have to face them, no reason to postpone that. I associate smoking with a lot of pleasurable things, e.g. sitting on my patio all day, taking a break at work, relaxing after a good meal, getting away from social interaction when i want some peace, etc. I realized that i actually don't need smokes to do all these things. E.g. i still go out on my patio, stay there for 10 minutes reading some stuff on my tablet, then going back in to whatever i was doing. Same for my 5 minute breaks at work. I just do what i used to do, without smoking. I sometimes replace the smokes with a beverage, nut or sweet.
* **Keep yourself busy**. Your brain only waits for a chance to lure you in.
* **Find something positive every day**. E.g. today i observed that my smoker fingers returned to looking normal again. Sounds ridiculous, but it's a positive observation that kinda keeps me craving for more.

I have no idea whether this will work out or not. My brain is trying really freaking hard to convince me that a smoke would be amazing.

Funnily enough I kinda wrote a "I hate smoking" song long before my mind said "enough". [Check it out if you want to have a laugh :)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuEY_Co9d4)

Thanks for reading, hope i can contribute something positive to the folks around here.

TL;DR: oi, wall of text. I quit smoking. I intend to keep it that way.

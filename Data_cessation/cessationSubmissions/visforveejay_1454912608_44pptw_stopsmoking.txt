Can I stop right now?

I'm at home after the super bowl party with my fiends. I'm a little drunk, I'm out of smokes. I'm sitting here staring at myself in the mirror wondering if I can be done right now. Do I need that "goodbye smoke"? Do I need one more day? Has anyone here had success just deciding they were done? I'm so sick of being a slave to this

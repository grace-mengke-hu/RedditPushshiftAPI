I have tried going cold turkey several times, but failed. What do you think about gradually decreasing the amount of cigarettes smoked daily?

I've been smoking a pack a day for nearly 2 years, and I want to quit. My cold turkey attempts, however, did not last long -my record was 14 days. Going cold turkey is not working for me, it seems. Right now I am contemplating gradually decreasing the amount of cigarettes I smoke daily. What is your opinions on this? Do you have any advices? If you have quitted by going cold turkey, how many attempts did it take?

Thanks in advance, and have a wonderful day. :)

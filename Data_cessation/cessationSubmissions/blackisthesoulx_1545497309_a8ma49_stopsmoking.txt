72 days smoke free yaaay :)

I posted this 69 days ago and was on day 3 then. (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/9o2zu7/3_days_smoke_free_using_low_nrt_so_far_so_good/?st=JPZP29LB&amp;sh=e3abf893)

Yaaay so pleased with myself. Havenâ€™t had a cigarette since then and as time has gone on Iâ€™ve got to the point where I donâ€™t even crave a cigarette anymore. I feel a lot better and I smell a lot better. My home smells great now too. 
Iâ€™m on the ecig still, 0 nicotine. Just need to get out of the habit of using that now. 
But yeah itâ€™s been just over 2 months and Iâ€™m so proud of myself that Iâ€™ve managed to cut out cigarettes and now nicotine completely. 
Glad i found this subreddit, after reading through peopleâ€™s posts I just thought, if you can all do it then so can I ðŸ˜Š

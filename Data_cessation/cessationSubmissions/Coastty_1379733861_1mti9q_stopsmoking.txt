Cigar Question

I was an occasional cigar smoker (and only cigars, one or two a month) for the past few months while I was living overseas, and during my last month abroad, I was smoking cigars three times a week, then suddenly stopped after I moved back home.  I haven't been able to smoke for the past two months since I moved back home, but recently (past two days) I started having cravings for cigars.  The thing was, I never had anything that I recognized as a craving up until this point.  Now I am afraid that should I smoke a cigar again, I might be hooked.  Any information?

Feel pretty helpless right now

Little background on me

Started smoking at age 17, 6 years later I'm still puffing away (sadly). I'm by no means a pack a day smoker but I do smoke around 8-10 cigarettes a day which is just as bad in my opinion. I read Allen Carr's book and I loved it, it really resonated with me and the man makes a lot of really good points on why you should quit and how. 

However after finishing the book I tried today to go without smoking and it just didn't work. I lasted about 4 hours and the urge became so unbearable I went out and smoked. I just can't take this. If the withdrawal pangs are this bad after only 4 hours I can only imagine the hell I would face tomorrow.....the first cigarette in the morning is always the best one in my opinion (even though Carr dismisses this myth) and I can't see myself waking up and not having that first smoke.

For those ex-smokers who I am truly envious of who did manage to quit, how? Any advice would really be appreciated...thanks

Day 1: Woke up with stomach ache

Hello. I've been smoking for about two years now. I've tried to quit three times before, after my father begged me to stop. He has been smoking for thirty years and lost his own father to heart failure consequent to decades of smoking.
Each time, I stayed cigarette-free for a couple of weeks. 
A week ago, under stress, I relapsed again. I smoked my last cigarette yesterday, at noon. 
Normally, I'd have my last smoke of the day before going  to bed, and the first one between taking a shower and having breakfast. 
Today, I woke up with a severe stomach ache.  Does anyone know of a good way to cope? Will it get worse? Thanks in advance!

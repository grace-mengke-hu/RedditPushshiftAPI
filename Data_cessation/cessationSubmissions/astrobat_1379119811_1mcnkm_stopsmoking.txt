My husband is trying to play a Vegas vacation in 3 months

We love going to the casino (we go once or twice a year). We love dressing up, pretending to not give a damn about money, the drinking, the gambling, the faux opulence, etc. That whole lifestyle and image you get to enjoy for a day or two. Which for us, has always included smoking like chimneys.  

My husband is trying to plan a trip to vegas I told him I'm not ready. He said it won't be until a few months, but I still don't know. It's been about a week and a half since I've quit and I've faced going out and drinking without lighting up, but I'm nervous about a vacation. 

How do you stand in a casino/hotel/city with smokers every 4 feet and deal? Will I ever be able to go to one again? Or on that note, how will I vacation with my smoking friends?

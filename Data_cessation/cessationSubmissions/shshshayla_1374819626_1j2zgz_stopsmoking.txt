I'm finally doing it.

After a long day of lots of exercise I went downstairs to enjoy my last cigarette of the evening. I do this just about every night but tonight was different. 

I've been lurking here for a little while and have already cut way back. I'm down to half a pack a day. There have been posts lately that have stuck with me and quitting for real has been on my mind quite a bit lately. During a long walk I took with my SO (who is an nonsmoker) we discussed getting fit at the gym together. It was an awesome discussion and I'm excited to start. He never brings up my smoking when talking about being healthy but I know be would like me to quit.

After we get to our apartment I grab a smoke and head back downstairs. I light it and the first few drags taste about the same as always. But suddenly it started tasting awful. With every drag I became more and more disgusted.  Why was I smoking this? Why does it taste so awful? I just kept smoking but the feeling and taste kept getting worse. I couldn't even finish it. 

I ran inside and upstairs and grab what I had left of my pack. I smelled my the cigarettes and I nearly gagged. I realized in that moment that I can't do this anymore. I broke the rest I had left in half and threw them away. I brushed my teeth took a shower and brushed my teeth again. 

I quit. I can't and don't want to do this anymore. I have very little temptation in my life and I am committed to not smoking. I feel really good about this decision and I'm really looking forward to being a nonsmoker.

Sorry if its hard to read I'm on my phone and a little sleepy.

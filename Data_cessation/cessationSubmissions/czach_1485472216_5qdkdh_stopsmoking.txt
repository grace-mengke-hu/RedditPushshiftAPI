Day 13 - Noticing the World Around Me

I asked my doctor back two weeks ago for a prescription for Chantix but she instead recommended Wellbutrin instead. I get a little dizzy after taking my doses, but so far, so good.

I'm definitely beginning to realize how stinky smokers are and I'm ashamed that I tricked myself into believing that I concealed the smell by doing a variety of de-stinkifying routines. But the air smells sweeter than ever before in the last seven years of smoking. The only downside is I notice how much my city stinks of pee when I leave the office.

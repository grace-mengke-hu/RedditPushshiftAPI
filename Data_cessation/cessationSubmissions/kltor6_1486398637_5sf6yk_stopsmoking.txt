Day 5 of no smoking

Currently on day 5 and doing great so far. 

I see a therapist for depression and a few weeks ago we discussed hypnotherapy to help me stop smoking. Best decision I've ever made. I haven't had too much of a withdrawal problem except for being jittery and my restless leg being more restless than normal.

I have zero cravings for a smoke, but I do miss it after meals and when driving.

64 days. Over 2 months. I fucking did it. You can, too. DO IT WITH ME!

HI. 

I smoked for 10 years. At some points, I was smoking over a pack a day. 

Fuck that. 

I haven't had a cigg in 64 days. 

I thought I would never be able to enjoy a beer sans cigarette. 

Fuck that. 

I can breathe. I can run. I can shine. I can fucking LIVE without those fucking cancer sticks. 

YOU CAN DO IT. 

Do not give up. If I can, you can. JOIN ME.

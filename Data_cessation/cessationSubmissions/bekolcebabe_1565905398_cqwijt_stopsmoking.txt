Climbing the walls ðŸ˜¬

Smoked more than a pack a day for 40yrs, not one cigarette for 12 days-got pneumonia &amp; have to have a repeat chest X-ray in a month to exclude underlying lung cancer, freaked me out &amp; decided I want to quit! Husband still smoking indoors, despite vaping am climbing the walls today. Tell me this is worth it!

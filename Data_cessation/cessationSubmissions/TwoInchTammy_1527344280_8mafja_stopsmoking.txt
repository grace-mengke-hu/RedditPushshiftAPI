The 307th time is the charm....

I have quit so many times it is impossible to count.  

My most successful attempt was 16 years ago, when I got pregnant 3 months after quitting, and I didn't smoke again until about 2 months after I had my kiddo. Postpartum depression got me.

Next to that, the next most successful attempt was about 8ish years ago I quit for 4 months while taking Chantix. As soon as I stopped taking the pills, it was like I had just quit the day before. I broke down and started again.

The last time I attempted to quit \- like 3 or 4 times over the course of this last December\-March, I managed to stay quit for 2\-3 week stretches. 

I am turning 40 in 26 days. This has been my far off deadline for myself for the longest time. "Well, I will quit before I am 40." 

I really let my kid down earlier this year when I failed to quit. So these two thoughts, the kiddo and my own desire to meet the deadline, are driving me. 

What also is driving me is the pure knowledge \- I can do this! It is possible. I will handle every future stressful event without smoking a cigarette. I will remain connected and social work without a cigarette. I have done it, and I can do it again, and stay quit this time.

And this just gives me the ammunition to laugh at my addiction and tell it to F off!

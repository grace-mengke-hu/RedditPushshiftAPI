I quit!! The patch works!!!!

I had a friend who used the patch, and he stopped smoking after 20+ years. So a few weeks back, I saw it at Costco on sale. So on Oct. 25th, I decided for my sons first birthday, that I would try quitting.

The patch works!! After the initial itchy feeling, I was in nicotine heaven. I used to smoke once every hour, and I would find myself looking at the clock, thinking I should be going outside, but I had enough nicotine already. It only took about 1 week, and now I can go without the patch most days. And I have about 20 more just in case.

Lastly, as a disclaimer. The patch only works if you WANT to quit. Smoking is fun, and if you still want to go outside with the guys, than the patch may not work for you. The hardest part isn't quitting, it is getting rid of the habits that came with smoking.

Tried Vaping.

So I quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey about a year ago. Recently I've been hitting my friend's vapes when i'm drunk. I don't consider it cheating because it's not tobacco. I decided to give it a shot and got a cheap vape and some juice. Gave it a week. Within a week I could tell a change in my health. I play soccer and go on runs frequently. It completely fucked up my lungs. I could definitely tell a difference in fatigue and coughing fits. I'm not gonna say it's as bad as cigarettes, but it definitely isn't good. I gave it a week, and I'm out. Hope somebody finds this helpful.

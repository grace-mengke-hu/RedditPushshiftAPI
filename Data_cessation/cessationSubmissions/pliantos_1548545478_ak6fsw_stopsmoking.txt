What I've learned after 21 days smoke free

Here I am, checking the 3 weeks smoke free mark, after 8 years of smoking and this is what I've learned:

I've learned that I like coffee, not just smoking while drinking coffee. I've learned that I like driving, not just smoke while driving. I've learned that I like whisky on the rocks, not just smoking while drinking whisky. I've learned that I like going out, not just smoking while going out. I've learned that I don't like staying out in the cold to drag some smoke in my lungs. Ultimately, I've learned that I like having sex, not just thinking how good a smoke will be after sex.

Do this challenge! Don't smoke for 21 days and tell me how you feel.

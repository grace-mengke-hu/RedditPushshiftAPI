About 8 hours in and I have a question.

I'm 29, been smoking for 14 years. I'm taking my first honest shot at quitting ever, starting today. It's only been 8 hours, and it's all I can think about. My question is: do you guys think it's better to hole up as much as possible until the worst is over, or is it better to live life just like normal and try not to think about it? I can't tell whether I should be hiding in my house or if that's actually a worse plan.

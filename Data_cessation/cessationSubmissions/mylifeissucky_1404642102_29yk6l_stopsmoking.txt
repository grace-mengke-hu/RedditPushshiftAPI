Can't wait for those "empty sockets" to close up...

Won't be too long it seems that the occasional socket will shut down. I had a longstanding socket, only in the background, though. I ignored and used sunflower seeds (spicy) and ketchup potato crisps. I got over the dizzy spell, just a little sleepy now, but nothing like before.

I can now think about WalMart and surpising Mum and Dad with Hey! I QUIT Smoking! I have leftover money where it would've been used for smokes.

Quitting smoking was not as hard as people made it out to be for some wierd reason. Possibly I was just plain ready and fed up.

There are occasional triggers but fewer cravings. I don't know why triggers are there, but so few cravings. I thought I would be craving for days.

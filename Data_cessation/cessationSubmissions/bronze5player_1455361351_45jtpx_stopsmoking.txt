Do I still get benefits with gum?

10 year cigarette and joint smoker here. I quit a few times before but eventually started again. My lungs hurt pretty bad so I really want to quit. I also have blood circulation problems and was wondering if nicotine gum has the same effect as cigarettes (less oxygen, worse circulation, faster metabolism). It was pretty rough on the toilet this morning but not sure if it was just a coincidence.

I only vape weed now but haven't smoked in 48 hours however I take a few gums a day.

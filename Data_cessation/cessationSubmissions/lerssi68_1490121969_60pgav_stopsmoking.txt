It's time

Today is the day I decided it's over. Not a single cigarette from now on. I started my mandatory military service (Finland) in january and I'm having some problems with money since we don't earn a lot here. Today I just decided, fuck it, smoking is too much of a financial problem for me. That itself is a good reason for me to stay quit, I believe. Also the ability to breathe better will help a lot here. Wish me luck!

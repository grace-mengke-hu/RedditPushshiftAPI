Not my first or longest quit, but probably my strongest

Been smoking for almost eight years now. I was up to about a half pack a day before this quit. So far, it has not been terrible. 

Day 1 was rough, mentally. The subsequent days were not as bad. I got through several triggers like drinking and weekend morning coffees without giving in. Then today was a very big test... the twin demons of boredom and depression. I'd had an awesome weekend with my friends and girlfriend, so suddenly going from being busy to not having much to do made me feel a bit down. Despite that, and a slight urge to go to the store, I stayed strong. 

I don't know why exactly I feel more confident being quit now versus other times. I think it has to do with where I'm at in life. I want to take steps to start the next stage of my life, and part of that means stopping some of the things I used to do. Smoking, drinking to excess, being unhealthy, being afraid of commitment. I wanna be done with that life. 

Not really sure what the point of this was, I just wanted to write my thoughts down. This community is a great one and I appreciate how everyone is so supportive.

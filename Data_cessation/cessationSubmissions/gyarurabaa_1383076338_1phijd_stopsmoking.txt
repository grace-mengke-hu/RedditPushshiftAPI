Quitting on Halloween. Need help!

My boyfriend and I are quitting FOR GOOD on Halloween, and I really need some tips on how to cope with the mood swings.  We have done this several times over the past year (trying to quit) and every time one of us gives in because we both get SO MOODY without cigs!  And then we both end up smoking again.

Does anyone have any tips?

I read through Quit Smoking the Easy Way, and I quit for one day.  It didn't help me at all.  

Thank you!

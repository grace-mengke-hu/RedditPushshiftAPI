Stupid relapse

So, quick background info: I'm 26 smoked between 10 and 15 a day for 10 years.

I had been thinking of quitting smoking at the start of December, as I'm sick of the smell, the cost and I worry about my health. I talked myself into leaving it until the new year and promised my fiancé that this time I'd stop for good. True to my word, my last cigarette was at 2am on New Year's day walking back rather merry after an excellent party. Rather than mess about with any aids which had been unsuccessful in my previous efforts to quit, I had tried going cold turkey. Cravings come and go, but I was largely doing okay. Until...

This morning! Work and my manager in particular were unbearable and my stress levels hit a new height. Next thing I know, I'm at the shop and I now have a 20 pack of cigarettes. Or 18 should I say, as I've already had 2.

I feel like an idiot. I also feel like I have let my fiancé down. I haven't told her yet, but she'll figure it out when I get home. I don't want her to think that this is like every other time I've tried to quit and failed, but it won't look good from where she is sitting. 

Apologies for the rant, but I'm just wondering i it's normal to fall off the wagon a couple of times and still meet the goal? I am really doubting my resolve at the minute!

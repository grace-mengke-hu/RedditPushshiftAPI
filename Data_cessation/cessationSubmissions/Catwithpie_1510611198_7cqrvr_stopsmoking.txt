I don't know how to do it and it's driving me crazy

Its like all I think about it how I want to quit. For months it's been like this. I have a box of patches and a box of gum just waiting to be used. I've read the easyway and I get it but it didn't quite do the trick. I know I'm an addict. I know it's a terrible manipulation of my brain. I know it costs so much time and money. I'm very aware of all of these. I just don't know how to start. Idk what to do here. I've never been to a gym, it doesn't interest me at all. I don't have nor want a bicycle. Maybe a skateboard to keep me distracted and healthy but I'm not even so concerned with my physical health. I feel stupid for smoking. Even moreso as I feel stupid for doing it and keep on going. It's ridiculous and this needs to stop. I just don't know how to begin. I want to be a non smoker. I want my time back. And I want to feel better, I guess maybe I should consider a gym? Anything you can say or ask or anything please help. I lurk here so much and am so proud of everybody who has stopped. It just blows my mind when I think about quitting while I'm lighting a cigarette with a cherry of the last. This needs to stop and if anybody can help me, it's you.

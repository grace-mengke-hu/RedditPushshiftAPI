Just a little over 96 hours smoke free.

Just barely over four days. Spent the last six hours drinking with coworkers at a work event. It was super tough to not think about cigarettes every few seconds. Considered even asking for a cigarette. Every time, took a deep breath and thought about the amazing smell of air that isn’t smoke. Relished the smell of anything other than smoke. Thought about my lungs, and my body and the four days I’ve already committed to this. Made it through. 

Yes, this is a somewhat drunken post. 

I’m just happy to be back in my hotel room tonight without a single cigarette to my name. 

Thanks and good night.

Depression..

I have struggled with depression pretty much my entire life. Just a couple of weeks ago I finally felt like I had found the right meds. I was feeling amazing. Then I decided to quit smoking. I know many people experience mood changes and mild depression when quitting. This seems to be the case for me as well but it's far from mild. My depression is as bad right now as it was before. I am 100% miserable. Please tell me I'm not the only person to have their depression flare up when quitting? And how long did it last? This is normal and should pass right?

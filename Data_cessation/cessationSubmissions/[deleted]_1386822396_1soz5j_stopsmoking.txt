Craving

OK, so I feel irritiable, lightheaded, a little anxious and just pissed off. It's incredible that nicotine withdrawal can do this. I'm just so glad that I'm over with that bullshit, no matter what I never want to put that bitch of a cunt nicotine in my body again. 
OK maybe I should go to the awwww subreddit and look at pics of kittens to settle me down.

Day 6...

Hello all 
I've been using you stories and comments to help me for the last 6 days. 
I quit smoking after smoking for 8 years (with a short break), I quit once before for a few months but made the mistake of having 'just one' when stressed at work which turned into a box, which turned into smoking again.

I actually don't know how I quit last time, I don't remember it being this hard!
I didn't plan on quitting when I did this time round but I smoked the last one in the box and thought 'ah to hell with it, I'll try quitting!' And haven't had one since.
Day 1 I was really motivated and excited so it was easy ish
Day 2 I was a bit shaky and craving but again, the adrenaline of what I was doing helped a lot
Day 3 was Christmas Day so although drinking a lot of wine made it more tricky, I was ok
Then it all went Downhill!!! I always believed once you're past day 3 you're fine. You're not. At all!
Day 4 I cried 5 times, mood swings hit and I was exhausted and miserable. I almost caved but luckily, with it being Boxing Day, the local shop was closed and I was too lazy to venture further to buy any.
I didn't sleep very well at all  that night, and when I did, I had the strangest dreams which would wake me up.. Horrible!
Day 5 slightly better but the cravings were very strong when I had them
Today (day 6) I was driving to my aunts, which is a 5 hour drive and I'd say at least twice in the journey I was ready to scream with cravings, as normally I'd have a fair few while driving.

Good god I hope tomorrow is better!!!

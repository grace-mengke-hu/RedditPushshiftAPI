Going on my first vacation as a non-smoker

I won't have to ask people where the smoking area is, I won't have to run out of the airports to grab a quick smoke, and then go through the TSA gropefests to get back to my gate, and I won't have to fill my suitcase with a carton just to make sure I have enough for the trip. I can spend more time just enjoying myself.

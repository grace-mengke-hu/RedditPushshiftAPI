21 Days! :)

I'm so happy to reach this day finally.

This past 21 days was pretty ok , I'm starting to feel much better when i'm taking long walks especially. 

and as well in the financial aspect , it was easier to handle my self instead spending it on Cigarettes.

My advice to you guys : You can do it! , don't give up , they'll be harsh days , but in the end , it totally worth it! 

Talk with me in 9 days! :D

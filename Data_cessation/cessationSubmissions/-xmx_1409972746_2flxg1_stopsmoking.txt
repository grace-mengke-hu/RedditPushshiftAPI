Friday night, two beers down

Friday night, two beers down. Watching a movie at home. 
I get cravings. 
FFirst thing I do, come here, read some posts,  especially of people with 50+ days,  read their accomplishments. Makes me want to reach there. 
Every time I get cravings, I fall back on you guys. 
So thank you very much. 
P. S. I'm getting a craving while writing this, so got to rush back to read another post :)

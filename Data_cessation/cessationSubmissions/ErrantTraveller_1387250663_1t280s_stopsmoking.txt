I hit 150 days, and it feels great.

It has come as such a huge surprise, but all my habits are changing now that I'm not smoking.  I don't drink as much, or as often.  I'm more productive at work.  I generally feel better, and I think girls are more attracted to me.  I may be putting on some weight, but I know I can beat that with a little exercise.  I hate the fact that it took me ten years to reach this decision, but I'm so glad that I'm quitting in my early 30s.  

Everyone stay strong.  No mater what is going on for you right now, life can only get better when you're not smoking.  Let's keep this poison out of our lives for good!

What are your exercise habits - if any?

So for the first month I mostly wanted to focus just on quitting cigarettes. I am a very intense person with almost no follow-through so I generally start out the month thinking I’m going to turn my whole life around and then end it exhausted, still smoking and surrounded by inexplicable, half-finished projects. So now I’m trying to take things one habit at a time.

I’m still stressed and still feeling some triggers more heavily than others (getting bills is always a big one for me). But I’d like to add some exercising to the routine. I hate exercising and I know you’re just supposed to find something active that you enjoy but I’m a poverty stricken single mother that moved to a new town and one of the only friends I’ve made has moved away. A lot of the activities I enjoy would be rendered very unenjoyable with a whining five year old added in. So I was wondering what y’all do? I’m especially interested in at-home exercises but I’m also looking for inspiration so please share even if it doesn’t seem like something I could do. 

Thanks again for being a great sub. I haven’t been posting or commenting much but I am lurking every day and checking my progress. Good job to everyone on here for quitting and sticking with it!!

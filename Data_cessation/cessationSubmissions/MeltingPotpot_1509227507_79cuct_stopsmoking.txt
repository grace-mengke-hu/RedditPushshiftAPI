3 month update!

I am happy and proud to share that I haven't smoked a cigarette in 90 days. These are my personal experiences since.

Breathe easy

I breathe so mich better. It's been a very long time since I felt like I breathe like a normal person and it feels really good.

Better sleep

I experience less bouts of insomnia and I bounce back much faster from all-nighters or sleep irregularity. I also moticed that I get better quality sleep.

Time is money

I save so much money and time not having to be hooked to an expensive habit.

Better stress management

I feel that I deal with my anxiety a lot better. I feel more centered. There was a period after quitting that I felt like I had a brain fog. It starting to go away and be replaced by clarity and centeredness.

More energy

Better breathing means more oxygen. More oxygen means more energy. I have more energy now and I feel less fatigued even after long days at work.

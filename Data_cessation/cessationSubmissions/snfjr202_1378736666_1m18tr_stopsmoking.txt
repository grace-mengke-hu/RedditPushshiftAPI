Its been 9 days so far, and you guys are awesome... Thanks stopsmoking

The Wife and I decided that Sept 1st was the day to quit, and So far so good - 9 days in. I found this subreddit 3 days in and have been lurking, and picked up some good insight so far and wanted to say thanks. 

I did it cold turkey, and she used the patch for the first few days. I have not really had a hard time, and cravings seem to have subsided drastically over the past day or so. Has anyone ever been so ready to quit that it was easier than you had ever expected?

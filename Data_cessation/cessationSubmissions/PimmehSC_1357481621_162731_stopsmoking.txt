Four days down, the realization!

Oh wow, I never thought it would feel like this. The last time I tried to quit I felt miserable for a few weeks before I finally could accept that I wasn't a smoker anymore.
Then I started again, and I noticed that it didn't feel like I had quit permanently.

This time it is different.
I didn't specify any last cigarette. I only said: I'm not buying another pack.
Then, late last night, I read the Easy Way. I found myself grinning at the end of the book, jubilant to finally be rid of that pesky addiction. I woke up with a smile, checking the cessation nation app to see how I am doing: Four days and over 70 cigarettest not smoked!

I'm never going to smoke again!

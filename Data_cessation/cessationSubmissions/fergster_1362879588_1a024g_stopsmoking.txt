I worked with a guy once...

Who used to smoke a pack a day for three months on, then three months off, three months on, three months off. And he stuck to it, rigidly. Literally, Jan 1st he would start smoking until 31 March, quit, and then spark up again on 1 July.. He stuck to that routine for the 2 years I knew him and never broke it.

He said he enjoyed smoking too much to quit and it always gave him something to look forward to during the months he had "quit".

I'm two months in and the cravings are still annoying me. Like tonight for example, if there were cigarettes in the house, I would probably smoke one. In fact no probable about it, I would. 

Sometimes, I wish I had my friends discipline but I know I don't and my mind is playing tricks on me trying to convince me to smoke again.

Day 2, and it aint easy.

Hey been off fags since Sunday morning, Sunday and yesterday weren't bad but my cravings have increased substantially today. Constant irritability and an awful urge to kick people in their big stupid heads. Help, I need something to take the place of fags in my life like that scene in Indiana Jones. Holy fuck, fucking cunt. I'm not going to smoke, I just want my brain to chill the fuck out and realize that. akhds[okhf[dsofdnw[iofgnw[e

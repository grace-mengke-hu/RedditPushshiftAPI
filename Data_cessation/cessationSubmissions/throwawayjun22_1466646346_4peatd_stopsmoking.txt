Extreme exhaustion after quitting -- how do you combat this?

My husband quit smoking three months ago after smoking for over 30 years. His breathing has improved but otherwise, he's still miserable. His digestion is terrible so he feels bloated all the time, but even worse than that is he feels constantly exhausted. He's tried everything -- exercising, not exercising; drinking an average amount of water/coffee/tea, drinking a LOT of water/coffee tea; low fat diets; energy drinks; B vitamins; mint gum....etc. etc. It's not improving his sleep schedule. He can't get anything done during the day because he's tired and lacking in focus, and it's making him feel like a failure.

So....has anyone here had a similar experience of sleep problems after this many months? How long did it take you to feel normal again? Any tips of other avenues he could try to increase his energy? I feel really terrible that quitting smoking has made him feel worse than ever.

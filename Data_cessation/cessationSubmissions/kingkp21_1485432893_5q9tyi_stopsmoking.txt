I feel it's impossible

Hi guys, it's my 2nd day on here and reading all your posts motivates me and it does make me want to quit. Trust me I have tried every single day to say that this is my last pack of ciggies. Thing is I just can't seem to stop. Please help me guys I really want to do this for my girlfriend and for my family. I have tried everything I possibly can but it's so hard. Ironically I'm smoking one as I type this. I smoke about a pack a day and I want to do this cold turkey.

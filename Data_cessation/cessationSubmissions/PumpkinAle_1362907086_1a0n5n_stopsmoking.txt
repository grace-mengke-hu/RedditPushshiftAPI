Had to quit in February. 

I thought I had not had a smoke for 35 days but because of on 28 days in Feb, I am only at 33. Lame! Just kidding, I have had ups and downs and downs and ups,still get urges but this last week (at least) has been great. I feel better, sleep better, breathe betterish, so many things are better! Becoming a non smoker has gotten me very excited about doing other things like getting back in shape, getting my shit back together with school, work,  and just because it goes with getting back into shape dressing better. This is still just the start of my transformation but at times I can feel the new me and it is wonderful... If you are just starting your journey, thinking about starting or just need someone to talk to about it feel free to shoot me a message, I am there for ya (even though i am not a wordsmith/grammar guy)!

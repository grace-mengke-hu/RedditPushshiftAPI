Checking in at the two year mark!

It's been two years since I smoked anything of any kind.  I was a hard core smoker.  I couldn't put them down.  I smoked first thing in the morning and the last thing at night.  I was up to about 1.5 packs a day.  I tried everything to quit.  It took me about a year of constant quitting every morning before I finally caught traction. 

I wanted to report that it does get better.  That nagging feeling of wanting a cigarette will leave you.  The feeling of envy you feel when you see someone smoke will gradually turn to sadness for them.  You will realize how wonderful life is when your not shackled to a drug morning, noon and night.  According to my stop smoking app on my phone (which I almost never look at anymore) I have not smoked: 21999 cigarettes, and have saved $7149.  That is huge.  If you are having a hard time remember this, The tide will recede, the cravings move out eventually and are eventually replaced by a wonderful feeling of being free. Finally free from a disgusting habit that ruled ever my everyday.  I am a free man today.  I have a choice every day weather to smoke or not.  Before I quit, I had to smoke every day regardless.  Thanks to this sub and to everyone who was supportive.

Whatever it takes...just get that damn drug out of your system and get on with the business of being a free person.  

I am nicotine free and you can be too.

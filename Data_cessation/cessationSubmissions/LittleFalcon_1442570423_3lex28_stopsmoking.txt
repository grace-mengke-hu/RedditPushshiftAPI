Today's The Day

So I've been on tobacco for close to 4 years now. It's crazy just to think that and I don't even want to fucking know the money I've spent on it. I started out chewing, thank fuck I at least don't do that anymore- God is it gross. Anyway, right now I smoke on average 2 Blackstone Cherry cigars (they're made by Swisher Sweet and are the same size cigar as Black n Milds in the states). As of now, I've quit smoking weed and am quitting alcohol, so I figured "Fuck it! Let's get a hat trick!" I know for a while I'll miss Blackstones, but I know this will all be worth it! I'll be sure to post when I'm feeling shitty or when I'm doin good! Wish me luck, I'm gonna be back once I have a full day under my belt.

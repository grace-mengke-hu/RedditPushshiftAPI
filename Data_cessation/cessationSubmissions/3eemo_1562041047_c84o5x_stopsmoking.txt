A Revelation

It suddenly came to me,whilst reading an article about smoking relapse rates that-
I AM NOT A SMOKER ANYMORE 
Yes I know it’s only been a month-but a switch clicked on inside of me. I realized I’ll never need to smoke again-Alan Carr refers to this as the moment of revelation and it is so overwhelmingly wonderful I think every one should experience this moment.
I think one thing that really helped me get to this place was I didn’t give myself permission to mope or grovel or feign misery because I’d given up smoking. I didn’t really alter my life in anyway shape or form,for fear of being tempted to smoke. Slowly but surely the lie that “I need a cigarette,”lost it’s power over me and I’ve at last realized I can deal with life as a non-smoker
Thus I am a non smoker
My approach might not work for you but I suppose I’m trying to encourage whomever to go out and embrace and celebrate life as a non smoker-the more you do this the sooner you’ll realize that you are free-
Free indeed 🙂

479 days... and been craving all week!

So I'm at a year and a few months, I thought this stuff was supposed to go away but it's been a difficult couple weeks on the no-smoking front.

The weather is getting cool and for some reason those perfect fall days make me crave a smoke so bad. Also some stuff causing stress in my life which is compounding the issue of course.

I'm really amazed at how strong a craving could be this far out. It's more diffuse than the old ones, more like a vague wanting that spreads across a few days, but boy is it persistent.

I know I don't actually want a cigarette, I know why I quit and I know it was one of the best decisions I've ever made and followed through on. But, you know, it does feel like I want to smoke and I'm scared of a relapse.

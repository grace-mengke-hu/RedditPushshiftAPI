Do you have any tips for staying off smoking while drinking alcohol?

I've not smoked since Dec 27th. To be honest, I've experienced typical nicotine withdrawl symptoms but haven't found it too difficult as a whole. The biggest challenge for me is when it comes to drinking or being in a pub atmosphere - that's what gets me started again. A combination of the relaxed environment and the alcohol makes it easier to convince myself to "just have one" -- it's the reason I stopped drinking alcohol on the same day. However, on Tuesday I've got a night that I need to attend  and it's in these types of situations that I fail.

My idea is to have one or two alcoholic drinks but mainly drink soft drinks so that I don't get drunk. Do any of your have the same problem? Do you have any tips on overcoming the urge while in a pub and drinking alcohol?

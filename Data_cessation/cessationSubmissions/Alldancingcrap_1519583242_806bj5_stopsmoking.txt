Today I wanted to smoke. But I won’t.

Today I wanted to smoke, and it’s only 1:20pm. I’ve been having a rough few weeks. I’m currently in a rough patch with my SO, which we are working together to fix. I’m broke, and receiving minimum hours at work. I’m also in school four days a week. So, it’s tough to work the hours I need to. 

Today I went out with a friend to banter back and forth about personal things and catch up after a week of not being able to. We went to a breakfast bar, and I drank. Whenever I drink I want to smoke. But I didn’t smoke. I knew it would only make me feels worse later. 

It’s hard because when I want to smoke I’m a non-smoker. When I’m a smoker I don’t want to smoke! 

These last 13 days, I have worked through so many hurdles. The start of the argument with the SO, the passing of a good friend, and of course stress. 

But I know deep down if I get into my car and go to the store and buy a pack and start smoking it. I will only make myself feel worse than I already do. 

I’m proud that I realize this. I’m proud that I’ve almost been two weeks smoke free. I’m proud that I’ve been through way too many more challenges than I thought would be happening at this point in my life; and still managed to say no to smoking. 

I don’t ever want to smoke again, but that doesn’t mean that I won’t ever crave it again. 

For all of you that want to smoke when you’re not, but want to not smoke when you are. Quit now. Be proud of yourself that you can get through the hard times without nicotine. Without 7,000 chemicals that are entering your body every time you smoke! 

Here’s to 13 days, and two weeks, and the rest of my LIFE! I am done with cigarettes!

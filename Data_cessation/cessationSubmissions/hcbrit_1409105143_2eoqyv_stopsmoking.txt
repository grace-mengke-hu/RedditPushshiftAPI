I've set the date. Preparation tips?

Hello! I recently set a date to quit smoking. I've tried to quit before but I have never lasted more than a day. I find myself getting bored, or hungry with nothing to eat, so I give in and buy a pack. I also get very moody! This has happened quite a few times! 

My last day of smoking will be September 21st. What tips can you give to me to prepare for the big day? 

Thank you.

Any experience with Chantix?

I started smoking when I was 17. Now I'm 30 with a wife and two kids and another on the way. Would really like to give this up. I've never smoked in front of my kids and haven't in front of my wife in probably 5 years. I mostly do it at work. 

Wife wants me to try Chantix. I've heard people say it gives you vivid dreams and stuff like that? I don't really like the sound of that.

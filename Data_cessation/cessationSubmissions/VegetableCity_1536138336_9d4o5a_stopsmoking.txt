Day 4 :)

4 days and going strong. Been a VERY heavy smoker for around 2 years. I’ve noticed an increase in my appetite since I stopped, is that normal? Also, since I started the nasty habit I’ve noticed a decline in my sex drive and I’ve had embarrassing problems in the downstairs department. Also no morning glory since I started. Will this clear up?

Quitting nicotine completely

So i’m still young, 18, and I went a few months of smoking cigarettes and it got to about 2 packs a week and I knew if I didn’t stop then, that it would only get worse so I started vaping, but I want to stop using nicotine completely. 

I know this will sound silly as fuck, but i’m nervous about stopping vaping because I feel like the urges are gonna be a lot to handle since i’m pretty addicted. the constant craving of nicotine scares me in a sense that I don’t wanna deal with it everyday and have it hold me back or stress me out, especially at work. i’m just not sure what to do

I’m a non smoker

I’m prone to sinusitis / bronchitis, so I’m very sensitive to cigarette smoke.  It can trigger asthma attack.  I can’t stand the smell at all.  So if you are trying to quit, it may feel like a wasted effort for nothing, it really means A LOT for people like me, so I just wanted to say thank you for trying, and good luck.

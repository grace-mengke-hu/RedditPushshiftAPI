10 Smoke Free Life Improvements so far...


1. I was free from being in the negative spotlight of being outdoors for a big chunk of time answering the multiple calls of the Tobacco demon while visiting at my mom's this weekend.

2. I feel girlier and more feminine w/o having to try masking the tobacco funk with multiple hand washes and fragrant lotions and perfumes and fabric softener overloads.
Which were pretty fruitless in the end.

3. I feel a deeper connection to God.

4. I have a new sense of liberation and freedom.

5. I feel stronger and encouraged.

6. I feel glad about taking a big step towards living much, much, much healthier than before.

7. My assertiveness has grown in productive ways.

8. I am kinder to myself and more attentive to my needs and likes.

9. I've become more humble and willing to reach out for help and to shut up and listen to those who have overcome and are overcomers.

10. I feel like I have begun a fresh new life and I am more clear headed and aware to appreciate the miracles that happen moment to moment.

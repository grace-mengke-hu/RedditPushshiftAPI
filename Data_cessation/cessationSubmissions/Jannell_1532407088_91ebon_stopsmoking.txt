Checking in at the three-year mark.

There have only been a couple of times that I seriously considered buying a fresh pack. They were both times when I was in despair, crying, just wanting relief. But I either came here to seek support and/or did some deep breathing stuff. I hope you're all doing the best you can and keeping at it. It does get easier.

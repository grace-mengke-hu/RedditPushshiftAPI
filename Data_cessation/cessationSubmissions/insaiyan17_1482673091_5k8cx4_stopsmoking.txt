The last addictions I need to quit, starting now

Hey folks

Yesterday was my last day using nicotine (swedish snus). Today has been hell so far, but hopefully I can do it. 1 month ago I was addicted to caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Classic right? 

I quit caffeine 4 weeks ago, I quit alcohol 2 weeks ago, and today it's time for nofap and nicotine. I expect to cut sugar in a couple of weeks, because i will inevitably survive on sugar just to get a little bit of dopamine reward. 

Anyway, just wanted to reach out and tell you it is possible, and it does get better! I hope this post gives me some accountability for myself - If you have any advice feel welcome to comment! much love and support to you all :)

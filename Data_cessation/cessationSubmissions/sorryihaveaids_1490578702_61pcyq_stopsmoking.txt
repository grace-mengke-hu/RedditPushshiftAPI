Who knows how long

Hey all, 

I smoked since I was 18, and I loved every second of it. Well that isn't true after three years or so it started to not benefit me at all. I had to smoke to feel normal. I smoke every hour or so to reduce the feeling to smoke. 

After eight years of smoking I decided to quit. It wasn't my first time coming to that conclusion, but it was my last. That was December 2013 and with a few weaknesses and a very strong woman Ive not smoked since. 

I just wanted to say it does get easier. Every hour of the craving turns into once a day, which turns into once a month, which turns into once a year. 

It still hits me, the craving, but it's almost like a nostalgia. It's there but it's something that's impossible to reach again. I can appreciate it, but I'm happy it's past. 

Sorry for the rant, I just hope the best for you all.

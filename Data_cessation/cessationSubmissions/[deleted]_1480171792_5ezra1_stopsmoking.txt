So This Is What "Clean" Smells Like???

This morning, as I got ready for work all squeaky-clean and smokeless, it hit me that I could actually smell myself.  Not me with smoke on top of perfume on top of smoke on top of body wash on top of smoke on top of shampoo on top of smoke.  

My coat didn't have that stale bar smell (that I only realized it had because now it doesn't smell like that).  I walked into the back room of my job where I used to smoke out the back door and it didn't have that lingering stale smoke smell (because I aired the crap out of it & hosed it down with room deodorizer yesterday). 

I can't believe how awful I must have smelled.  

I'm a female in sales and I'm now wondering how many customers I "turned off" because I had an aura of cigarette smoke around me?  Now, I just smell pleasant.  I even used about 1/4 of the perfume I normally used to use.  This is gonna save me money in ways I never expected...

As for my breath:  DEAR GAWD WTF??? It smells like my mouth has tooted out an eggy fart!!!  You know how bad some old people smell when they cut one?  THAT is the smell that is coming out of my mouth today!!!  Yesterday, I got away with only one piece of mint gum (I would chew like, 10 a day when I smoked to cover up the smoke breath), but today I have a feeling I'm just going to keep a fresh piece in my mouth at all times.  I don't need to inflict Fart Breath on my customers.  I think they've been through enough.

On the plus side, I can actually smell my fancy-shmancy hand soap and hand lotion now.  This is encouraging...

But my breath-  DANG!!!! My mouth is a good place for a Stick-Up right now...

Holy 7 Days. Sweet Glorious Ability to Breathe

I haven't felt this good in a long time. It has NOT been easy by any means and it's a constant battle, but I'm hoping that this time I can keep pressing on and stay away for good. I feel great, I just wanted to say thanks to you guys for sharing all your stories and your advice and being there for me. It's been awesome!

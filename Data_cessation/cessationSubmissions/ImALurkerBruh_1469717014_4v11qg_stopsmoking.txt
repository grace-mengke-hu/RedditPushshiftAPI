DAY 2!! HOLY IRRITABILIY BATMAN!!

omfg. im so proud that ive gone a full day with no nicotine. see my previous post for my history but holy shit I wanna kill someone (not really plz don't report me). When does the irritability go away? When I woke this morning the craving was even worse than yesterday after eating dinner. Luckily I have some no-nicotine-no-tobacco fake snuff pouches and those are helping tremendously. Im ready to say "2 days without nicotine after 8 years."

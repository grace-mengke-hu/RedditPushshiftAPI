Quitting Tip that might help

Whenever you buy a pack of cigarettes, take out one of them and then crush/throw all the others in the trash. This works because you will start to realize how much money you are wasting on something you are trying to quit and associate smoking with negative emotions of wasting money on just one cigarette. If you have lots of money just buy a carton and do the same thing!

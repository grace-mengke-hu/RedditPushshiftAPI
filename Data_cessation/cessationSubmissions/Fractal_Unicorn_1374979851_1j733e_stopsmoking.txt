90 hours free of nicotine!

And I'm starting to feel healthier already. I made a Turkey Club sandwich today, and I'll be damned if that wasn't the best damn Turkey Club sandwich I've eaten in the last 5 years!

14 hours in on the first day is when I started getting really bad cravings. I felt like hell, I hadn't stopped fidgeting for 3 hours (could have likely been because of my ADHD), and I looked/felt beat. I threw in a stick of gum, walked around town, and just wrote about my feelings so far though. All of that really helped get over those initial cravings. 

The second day in, I had my first Big test I feel. Went over to a friends house, and two of my buddies shared a cigar. I tried to not look at it as much as I could, and just stuck with my gum. Easy. A few more friends come over, and we grill up some food and all have a few beers. At this point, I had taken apart a Bic pen (damn lighter company!) and was using the plastic tubing as sort of a make-shift cig. Pretending to drag on that for most of the day. Cravings were pretty bad, and simulating the motion of smoking a cig helped me tank through the day and night.

However later that night another friend came over with his Hookah. NOPE. I was a good boy you better believe! Sat around, and watched my friends smoke the Hookah, but I refused it when it came my way. Damn proud of myself.

The past 2 days have been pretty mellow, and I've had very few triggers. All in all things seem to be going great, and I'm actually glad that my friends unknowingly put me through that test because it really helped me prove something to myself. Needed to express all this to you guys sorry XD

Looking forward for the coming weeks/months/years/decades/centuries. Keep your wills strong everyone!

Day 2. I'm alright. How are you guys doing?

I was out with some friends last Thursday, and one of them is currently in Medical School. I have never been a big smoker, but I am going in that direction. It started as a social thing, then I occasionally did it by myself. And now I'm smoking a pack every 2-3 days. He was talking about a patient he had and long story short said "smokers dont just have an increased risk of lung cancer. they have an increased risk of cancer EVERYWHERE. if someone says they are a smoker when they come in, we look for cancer everywhere"  
  
it just kind of put everything in perspective. What he said really hit home. So im quitting. this is day 2.   
  
Im going to start running again as well.

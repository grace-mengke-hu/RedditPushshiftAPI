Today I quit smoking and got the smoke free app. 8 year smoker calling it quits.

Reading this sub, I’ve seen a lot of people use it and it looks like a helpful tool. Definitely can already imagine the cravings I’ll experience in certain scenarios. Those times that a nice cigarette would certainly enhance. But that fleeting pleasure is not worth the long term damage. Wish me luck!

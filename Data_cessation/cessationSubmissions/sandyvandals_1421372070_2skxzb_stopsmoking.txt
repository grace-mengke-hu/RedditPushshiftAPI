Welp, back to square one I guess.

Hey guys. I broke today, after a heated argument with my roommates about a developing problem with the rent. I won't bore you with the details, but essentially one roommate is not coming back after our winter break and its making everyone's rent go up. We were hashing out the distribution calmly, until one of my more "hot-headed" roommates came home.

It was a long night, but we cleared it up the best we could. I was shaking with frustration. I called up one of my best friends that still smokes and had one with him.

I feel like crap for breaking my promise. But I think this is a good thing, because its becoming clear to me that quitting is something I care about.

I can do this. 

Edit: Grammar.

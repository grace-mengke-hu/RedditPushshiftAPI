I want to smoke because he gets to

My husband and I quit smoking in Dec 2015. I am coming up to nine months and was very rarely thinking of smoking. Than I just found out my husband has been hiding his smoking for four months. Now all my craving are back and I'm so jealous he gets to smoke now. I will not start back up, I have lung problems and I hate having to smoke ALL the time. Just wanted to complain!

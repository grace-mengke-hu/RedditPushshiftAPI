Help! Depression is kicking my ass.

I quit smoking close to 8 months ago (August 5th, 2013). It was the third time I quit with a lot of determination, and I quit cold turkey. After the first month, it was pretty smooth sailing. However, over the last month or so my depression has been spiraling out of control, and it is taking all of my willpower to not get in my car and grab a pack. I have my two big craving fighters with me - tea tree oil toothpicks and ginger candy - but I would really appreciate a little support and advice right now. Before anyone asks, yes I am looking for a therapist/psychologist (been going to a student psychologist-in-training at my college since it's free, not much help), no I am not suicidal or anything, just stressed, anxious, and self-defeating. Please and thank you, guys.

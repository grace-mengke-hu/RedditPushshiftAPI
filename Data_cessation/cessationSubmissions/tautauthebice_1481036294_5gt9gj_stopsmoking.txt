Should i reset the counter?

I had little over 100 days in legit. but met up with some smoker friends and had a few. after some struggles ive somehow managed to only do 1 a week for 2 months now. i really dont know how it happened. im so grateful it did tho. 

im the first person who will tell you 1 a week makes it so much harder. but idk how i guess ive just been distracted too well this time. havent been bored enough to make myself go mad thinking about it. also i have pretty much just been hanging out with smokers once a week.

anyway its kinda under control. im 22 i knew from the start that its not gonna be easy to quit forever. idk what im doing with this 1 a week thing. i missed last week's cig and am bored so my mind is messing with me with thoughts kinda why im here.

anyway how often do u guys reset? it looks great.

Fuck it im quitting!

Okay so Im 18 and I live in the Philippines. On here, as a teenager youre "cool" if you smoke. So when I was 16, I first tried it. (I wanted to punch my old self for ever trying). Fast forward two years later, and I want to quit because I noticed I cant get up four flights of stairs without feeling like dying (Mind you Im a pretty skinny guy so this shouldnt have bothered me). Im on my 2nd week of not smoking. Anyone have any advice? :)

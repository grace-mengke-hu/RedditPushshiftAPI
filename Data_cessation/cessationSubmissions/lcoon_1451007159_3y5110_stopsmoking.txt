One year-ish! (Not My real date)

1 year ago I said, 'I'm done!' and purchased my last pack of cigs. I then went smoke-free for three months. On March 06 I bought a pack only to smoke three and throw the pack away. Then the next week I bought another pack only to smoke one and throw the pack away. Then while drinking the following weekend, I smoked almost a whole pack and had a tobacco hangover the next day. It was then I figured enough was enough. I saved a lot of money, had 3 months of smoke-free goodness. I'm not going to let something like this defeat me. So I quit.. this time for good.

I like to celebrate this date, because if I didn't have this three months under my belt I would have continued smoking. 

I hope everyone stays on the path of non-smoking even if you fall of the band waggon. Just keep going, eventually you will succeed.

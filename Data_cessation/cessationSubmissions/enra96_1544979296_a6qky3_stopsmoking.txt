I am still young!

Hey there... i am 22 and stopped smoking almost 2 weeks ago. I downloaded the app "smoke free" - it helps immensely. 
Started "daily" smoking some 3 years ago. Been battling my   strong feelings of stress with cigarettes. Quitted because my girlfriend is a non smoker. Although my flatmates all smoke, also indoor, it doesnt really bother me. The only danger is when being drunk. Yesterday celebrated my birthday party and i craved. 
But I see this whole thing as kind of a life-changing thing. Smoking makes me someone that I dont want to be. And to me it seems that almost all of the people that smoke live their lifes as I dont want my life to be. When I now look around my room, I see a nice room that fits me. A lot of things changed positively since I've quitted. 
When I stopped, a youtube video helped me. There lots of non smoking content on youtube.
Maybe I am exxagerating since its only two weeks, but I am sure that there better sins than smoking.

Just wanted to share my non-smoking story with you!
Wish you guys all the best quittin smoking and you please wish me strenght to maintain!

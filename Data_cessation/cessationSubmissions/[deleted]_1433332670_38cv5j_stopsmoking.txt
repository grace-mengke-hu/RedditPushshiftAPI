Quit smoking two weeks ago, my allergies have come back and they are INTENSE..

I expected some allergies to return when I quit, but this is insane. My nose is completely plugged, my head/eyes feel swollen, etc.. Allergy meds do not seem to be working at all.

I had bad allergies before I started smoking (smoking seemed to tone down my allergies quite a bit). They weren't THIS bad, but yeah. How long does this usually last?

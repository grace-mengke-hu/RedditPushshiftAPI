Seriously only smoke when I drink.

Problem is I drink 2-3 days a week. However, if there is no drink in hand there is no smoke in the other. Why is this? I maybe smoke 3-4 packs a month, but I want to stop. I can't even remember the last time I had a smoke without alcohol. Maybe 7 years? How do I defeat smoking while drinking? Anyone else like me here? This has been going on for ~10 years.

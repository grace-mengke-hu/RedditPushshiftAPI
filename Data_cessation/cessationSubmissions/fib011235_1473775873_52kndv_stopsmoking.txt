alcohol is the worst(or should i say 'the best' trigger)

after being a non smoker for 2 days, i went to a party last night, i was pretty confident i wouldn't smoke, but once i started drinking i just couldn't stop myself..i smoked a pack from there on...woke up this morning and felt like shit..maybe i should stay away from parties for a while, but then i don't want a cigarette controlling my life...difficult times ahead....

I honestly believe i did it!

Hey guys,


88 days ago i quit smoking after a night of deep meditation where i somehow came to the conclusion that smoking doesn't belong to my life anymore.I know this sounds odd and i haven't told anybody other than you guys because I myself was kinda confused about the way i came to this decision.However,i haven't touched a single cigarette since then and i don't feel the urge to touch one ever again in my life.I'm actually disgusted by the smell of them.

All the time i was kinda sceptical because i smoked almost all my life and i knew how hard it was for me to quit when it was only my rational ego telling myself to quit.But MYSELF wanting to stop smoking and never do it again has done it...After these ~90 days i feel very confident to never touch a cigarette again.


This subreddit is wonderful! I would love to help every single one of you because i know how hard it can be.This is my tip: Find a way to reach your inner self...maybe you are not a spiritual person and these words confuse you but just try it.Believe me...Try to get in touch with the person inside that lies beneath the turmoil of everyday life.It helped me...That's all i can tell you.

I know you guys can do it too and i hope you will!
Best wishes

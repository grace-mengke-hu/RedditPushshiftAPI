What a stressful night

I just had so much stress last night that I couldn't sleep. And I still can't get to sleep. I kept going over how a cigarette would make it better. But then I thought to myself that will only make things worse. So I decided to take two shots of tequila. Not to substitute the craving but maybe just to calm my stress a little. But I don't want to make this an everyday thing. Because there starts another problem. How do you guys handle stressful situations? What do you guys do to help you sleep better? I haven't had alcohol since i quit because that was my main trigger. But right now I'm not craving a cig nor do I plan on smoking one. How have you guys overcome some of your main triggers?

The latest trick my mind tried to play on me to get me to smoke again (spoiler: IT FAILED)

So I quit on April 12^th and for the past few days my mind has been playing tricks on me trying to get me to smoke again. *"You need the cigarette to relax"*, to which I would say that they have nothing to do with relaxation, or *"dude you're depressed, have a fix or your life will be ruined"* to which I would reply that I had several fits of depression when I was smoking so obviously it has nothing to do with smoking or quitting, etc. etc. 

But then my mind came up with this line:

> Smoking makes you look evil. You like it when you look evil.

And I actually thought this was a solid argument (*facepalm*). Of course 5 minutes later I realized that it's basically BS, not just BS but pretty cheesy BS if you ask me. Not "mysterious", not "cool" but **"evil"**. Seriously? What kind of shit have I been inhaling for the past 8 years that I would tell myself this nonsense just to take it again?!?!

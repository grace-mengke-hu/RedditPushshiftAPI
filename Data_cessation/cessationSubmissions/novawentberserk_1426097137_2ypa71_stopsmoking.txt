First time pmsing as a non-smoker. (Spoiler: it was hell)

I quit about two weeks ago and started pmsing the last few days, which has been intense. Cravings like the first few days of my quit, the irritability, the sadness...I felt like I was going crazy and almost caved several times. I think it was actually *worse* for me then my first 72 hours. Nothing in the literature prepared me for this. 

I can now see why its do much harder for women to quit. I feel like I just went through an emotional and mental battle that had nothing to do with  not'maintaining a positive quit attitude'. Did/do any other women feel this way? Does it get better next month and the month after?

Quitting tomorrow

Been smoking for about 5 years, 3/4 pack a day. Girlfriend is going out of town tomorrow for two weeks so I figured that would be a good time to tackle this. I quit once before for 15 days but I substituted weed for nicotine. This time I plan on substituting running (bought some shoes), PS4 (bought a PS4) and healthier eating/learning new meals. Wish me luck! I'm nervous as fuck, but all I have to do is not smoke. I don't care if I have a nervous breakdown, I'm not going to smoke. Starting tomorrow. Heh.

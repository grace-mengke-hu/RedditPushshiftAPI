Two New Achievements Unlocked!

When I first quit smoking, I was nervous because I couldn't imagine doing my favorite things without a cigarette. Drinking alcohol was out of the question. Long car rides would be a nightmare. Just making it through the workday without smoking seemed impossible. My favorite things--going to the beach, seeing live music, sitting on my porch--didn't exist without cigarettes.

So I started looking at these challenges as achievements, like a video game. They started small--go a few hours without smoking, don't have a cigarette on your ride home--but have grown in difficulty as time goes by. It took me a month before I trusted myself to drink without smoking. Visiting my cousins, who smoke, took even longer. But each time, I come out the other side feeling like I've really *acheived* something. And as more time passes, those big challenges seem so... do-able.

So this week, I took on some bigger, bolder challenges. I successfully went to the beach (with smokers!) and didn't have a cigarette, and I went to a three day music festival (also with smokers!) and didn't have a cigarette. 

This would have been absolutely unthinkable three months ago. Now, I'm amazed at how easy it is. I've never been so proud of myself for not doing something!

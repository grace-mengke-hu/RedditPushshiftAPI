I smoked regularly for only about 3 or 4 months. I managed to quit (almost) cold turkey, but even more than a year later I still get cravings. Just goes to show how easy and quick an addiction can develop.

I started smoking when I got a new job where everybody always smoked. I had gotten up to about 5 or so cigarettes a day (not a lot compared to others, but for me its still scary to think about) and when I started to get chest pains regularly, I scared myself into quitting almost cold turkey. I still had one cigarrette once a week for about a month after, and since then Ive only had a cigarette or two if I get really really drunk. Last time was end of this summer. 

Despite not getting as bad as a pack a day, or smoking for even a year or more, I still get cravings a lot. I even bought a pack today, but managed to throw it away before totally giving in. Just an example of how easy and quick an addiction can form and how hard it is to break.

Quitting Tonight

I've been smoking pretty regularly since I was 17. At this point most of the time I don't even actually want a cigarette, my body just needs them so I smoke 'em. But enough is enough. I'm enjoying the last ones I'll have today, but I won't be smoking any more after rugby practice tonight. 

I've been working towards this for a while now. I wanted to get in better shape, quit smoking, overall just take care of myself. I've been regularly working out for about 10 weeks now, I'm eating a lot healthier (with the occasional cheat day), and now it's time to give this up.

I want to be able to breathe better, I want the persistent cough I've had for 3 years to go away, I want to stop stinking of smoke all the time.

Wish me luck, I'm going to need it.

mentally preparing to quit. question to all you who have tried to quit before/are currently.

is there a master post or archive of tips/links/resources that could assist me as i prepare to quit? as well as any experiences and advice from those who have had the experience before? i want to be as prepared and equipped as possible when i quit and any pointers or help is appreciated. 

my partner and i (who have smoked for over a decade) are planning to quit together in a few months time. i know it will be rough and failing will be very difficult as i do not deal well with disappointing myself (or others) so i’d love to start out strong. thank you all!  i’ve been really enjoying seeing all of your progress. it’s an inspiration!

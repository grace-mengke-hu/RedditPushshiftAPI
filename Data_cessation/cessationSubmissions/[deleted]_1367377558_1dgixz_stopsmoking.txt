I made it three days.

Longest I've gone since January. I've woken up in an extremely sour mood every day since I quit, and when I was at Walgreens picking up a prescription while ruminating on all the reasons my ex was a bitch I decided fuck it and bought a pack. Stopped thinking about my ex as soon as I inhaled.

I fell into the trap of thinking that the way I felt so soon after quitting was permanent. How long does the irritability from quitting generally last? Can anyone with depression comment on how quitting affected their mood, and whether or not that also went away after a while?

Hypothyriodism and Smoking?

I quit for about 9-10 days. However on the 10th day, I still had a massive headache and nothing felt right. I have hypothyriodism. I was wondering if anyone else has this condition and attempted to stop smoking. How did it feel? I read online a little bit and people say things like:

But for hypothyroid patients, tobacco smoking presents another whammy. Namely, it stresses your adrenals over and over. And with adrenal fatigue being a common side effect of treating hypo with T4 meds like Synthroid, Levoxyl, Eltroxin, et all, as well as being dosed by the lousy TSH, you’ve got a third reason to fall into adrenal fatigue if you are a smoker.

Additionally, another factor in the difficulty of quitting is that cortisol decreases when you try to quit. A 2006 research report found that the lowered cortisol after quitting is associated with smoking relapse and with reports of increased withdrawal severity and distress. So, when you already have adrenal fatigue, and you quit smoking–a double whammy against being successful.

I really wanted to quit, but I just couldn't make it into work if I didn't smoke. I made it past the "physical withdrawl" period, but I was still getting heavy physical withdrawl. Should I take some adernal supplements?

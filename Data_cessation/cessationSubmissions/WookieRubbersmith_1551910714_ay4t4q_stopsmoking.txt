58 Days Smoke-Free!

I'm turning 30 in two weeks. I've quit and relapsed 6 times in the last 5 years. This is the longest I've gone without even a single drag since I was 25. This is the first and only "clean" (no slip-ups, no drags, no 1:1 replacement with vaping) that I've had this much success with.  


What's different? Well, this time, I haven't been lying to myself when I say I really don't want to ever smoke again. I actually mean it. I actually feel it in my bones. For the first time since I started smoking a decade ago, I actually do not want to smoke. I don't know exactly what changed, or when, but I am really confident that this. is. it.  


We (my husband and I) started out with patches and nicotine gum. We stopped using the patches about 2.5 weeks ago. I chew 0-2 pieces of gum a day. Cravings have been negligible. Withdrawal has been non-existent.  We hung out with our last friend who still smokes last weekend, had a couple drinks and played games late into the night. We even went outside with him when he'd go for a smoke. It didn't occur to us until after he left that neither of us were secretly hoping he might offer us one (he wouldn't have, anyway--way too good of a friend for that). It's been a looooong time since I could stand right next to someone smoking without reflexively wanting to smoke.  


I had a chest cold last week, and coughed up a bunch of black gunk from my lungs--still decontaminating. It made me feel especially appreciative that I've done this really nice thing for my body, after so many years of treating it so carelessly.  


I know that the ease I've experienced with this quit is not typical, but I am *extremely* grateful for it nonetheless. To anyone out there who might be struggling today, be patient with yourself. This is such a good, kind thing you are doing for yourself. You are stronger than you think you are--don't let the horrible, shitty days make you forget that.

Should I buy my girlfriend Allen Carr's "the easy way to stop smoking" or "the easy way for women to stop smoking"? ?

Is the one for women different? Or more effective for women? (Or unisex one better, or are they the same? What's the difference? 

How for it differ for women? 
Should I get her both?

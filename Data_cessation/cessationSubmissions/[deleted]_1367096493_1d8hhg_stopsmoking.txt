One year smoke-free, one year not, what do?

I stopped smoking in fall 2011 after being a smoker for 6 years. Then I went abroad for one year last september and started smoking again.

I keep telling me that I can stop when I'm back home and I actually am pretty confident about that.

Is this stupid? Should I try quitting while still being abroad? Will this haunt me for longer (starting again, quitting for 1 year, starting again etc.)? What should I do?

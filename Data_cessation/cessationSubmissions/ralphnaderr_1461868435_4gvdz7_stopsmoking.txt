Quit 6 days ago while sick with food poison, I hate living without them.

Had food poisoning and couldn't get out of bed, so I took the opportunity to quit cigarettes.  Now that I accomplished getting over the initial onslaught, I feel empty and not accomplished at all.  I'm at school and don't have any friends here, so at the moment the cigarette was my only friend.  I feel so lonely without it.  Now that I beat the initial withdrawals, which for me is sweating all night, physical pains in the chest/abdomen (could be related to the food poisoning), I just want to buy a pack again.  I quit smoking weed 3 weeks ago, and that was tough because that was my closest friend.  I can already feel the response coming saying "just keep at it! It'll get better" but for me it doesn't, I've quit before for 3 months and 5 months, it never gets easier and it never becomes "worth it" in my mind.  I exercise, look more fit than average, but have enough other health problems that piling this one on doesn't really matter much to me.  I don't know what I want to hear or need to hear, but I'm getting pretty ready to head out to the store.  I am also about to take finals, which doesn't help.  Thanks for your time if you read this.

Day 1 = done.

I'm a returning customer. ;) My last quit was almost a full year smoke free before I had "just one" and returned to smoking 1-2ppd for another year. I've known this was a temporary lapse but, as always, I had trouble committing to yet another quit. Kept setting dates. Kept finding reasons not to do it. Last night I ran out right before work and just decided not to buy more. I am using nicotine lozenges and a cheapo disposable ecig (I've read the Carr book several times but this is what works for me).

My husband quit 3+ years ago. He works days and I work evenings so I haven't told him yet. Want to see how long it takes him and the kids to notice. Anyway. After 20 years as a pack per day smoker with at least four 6-12 month previous quits, I'm determined to make this one stick. Tired of this cough. Tired of the breathlessness. Tired of the stench. Tired of being a slave to the cigs. 24 hours down. Can't turn back now!

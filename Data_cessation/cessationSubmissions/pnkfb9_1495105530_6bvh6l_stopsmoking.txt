5th day struggling

Hi guys, just venting ... Im at work and have to do something new, and a great anxiety exploded inside me! I am on without smoking , this time I feel like I am more aware of what I am doing, but the anxiety is killing me, is like "oh my god I am dying right now" sensation! How do you cope with such situation? 
Thank you!!!!!

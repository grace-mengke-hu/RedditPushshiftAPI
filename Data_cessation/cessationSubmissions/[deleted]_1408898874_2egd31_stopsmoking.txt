concerned about my father's health, requesting help

I'm 24, my dad is 65. He started smoking about two years ago after not smoking for my entire life. Now he's up to a half a pack-pack a day. This is the worst time for him to start, from what I've heard, given the increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and combined with his drinking I feel like it's just a ticking time bomb. It looks like he's aged five years in the last two. Heavier, looks older, "droopier" if that makes any sense and I don't know what to do. 

I've tried to reason with him. I've made appeals to him based on the way myself and my mom are concerned about it. I've also ignored it completely. Basically now I just let my discomfort with the situation known. Of course I know that there is not much that I can do, in the sense that he has to do it himself, but these habits will shorten his life and the fact is I want him to be around as long as he can be with a good quality of life.

I've read on reddit that there was one particular book that finally convinced people to quit? I want to get him this book but I can't remember the title and I was wondering if anyone had it. I would also appreciate any general advice. Things become normal but then every so often it just weighs on me and this is one of those times, so I decided to make this post about it.

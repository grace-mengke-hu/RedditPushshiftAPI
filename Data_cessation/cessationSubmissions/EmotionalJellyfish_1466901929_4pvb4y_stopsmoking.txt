11 days without a smoke, I don't know if I'll make it through today though.

This is the first time that I submit something to a subreddit, I'm on mobile so bare with me if there are any formatting or even spelling errors, English is not my first language. I'm 29F and decided to quit smoking after almost 7 yrs. I had a nasty cough and decided to try and go cold turkey. I also broke my foot, have a cast and I'm struggling a lot with it, can't drive and it hurts like crazy. I sort of have anxiety issues and I'm a bit overweight, I'm really scared that I am channeling my smoke cravings through food and is also affecting me in my weight and my relationships. I have been in a relationship for 9 years and we are also going through a rough patch so that is also adding some stress, he's been diagnosed with clinical depression and has strong ups and downs. My mom has been on me a lot because of my weight she is driving me crazy, saying that I'm worsening my injury, which I know it's true but her being so overprotective and overwhelming (despite her love and good intentions) it's about to drive me over the edge and start smoking again. I really think I'm going to cave today.
Anyway sorry for the long post I really needed to vent. Hopefully I can get some kind of advice and help here. Thank you!!

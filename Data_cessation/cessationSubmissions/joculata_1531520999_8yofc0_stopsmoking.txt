Any advice on my situation?

I have the great fortune of not having to work at all this Summer. I've quit before and was generally fine (very little withdrawal), but I always end up extremely unproductive, filling the void with food and youtube. The trigger is usually just a case of feeling down about not being productive, so I justifying starting again. 

This time it's gonna be even harder as I've moved away from all my friends and know basically no one. That aside, I think it's an ideal opportunity, but I don't wanna waste it and repeat the cycle once I have to work again. 

Anyone got any advice on staying productive while quitting? Or anything at all really...

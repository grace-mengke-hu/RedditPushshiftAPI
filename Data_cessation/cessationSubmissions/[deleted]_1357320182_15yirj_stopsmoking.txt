The Breath of Fire

The Breath of Fire is a quit smoking trick my mother taught me and it will turn your day around 180 degrees.

Wake up, first thing. Shoes, jacket, no cigarette. Its very important that you do this BEFORE your morning smoke. Drink a glass of water because this going to make you thirsty. Out the door.

Once you are out in the cold morning air you need to breath in until your lungs are ready to burst. Then breath out until you think your chest will collapse. In, out, in, out, as hard as possible. You will begin to cough up tar within the first few breaths.

Dig deep into your lungs and push every once out air out. Push until it hurts. As you do you will feel pieces of tar which are WAYYYYY down in your lungs start to move.

Breath in until you're smokers lungs can't handle any more. Suck air into your mouth and then force it down into your lungs, this will stretch them beyond their current capacity and cause large wads of tar to become unstuck.

Make sure to be walking at a good pace and blood will rush to every part of your body. You will feel exhilarated, fantastic, amazing, and awake. With each piece of tar you cough up you will get more oxygen in your lungs. Breathing gets easier.

If you do this you will get back in your door five or ten minutes later ready to make the day your bitch. And remember, the object is to cycle as much clean air into your body as possible.

Edit: *Iv never been hurt doing this but don't go crazy*
Make sure to stop if you find yourself getting dizzy, your cannot catch your breath, or otherwise have any problem which makes you feel worried or unsafe. If these problems persist for more than a few minutes call a doctor.

If you doubt me; try it. You have my guarantee.

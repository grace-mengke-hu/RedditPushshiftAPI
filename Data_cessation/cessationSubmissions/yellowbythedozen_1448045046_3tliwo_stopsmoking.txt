Day 147 seems tougher than Day 1, 4, or 7.

When I quit, I never really noticed or had any cravings. Recently it seems though that I've found myself wanting a smoke, but I haven't determined if it's more attributed to the stress from my job or my wife. Strangely though, when I smell the smoke from my co-workers coming inside from a break, it smells awful, but I still kind of want to join them.

The part of me that thinks I should give in and buy just one cigar says "well you're not supposed to inhale anyways, so just enjoy the flavor". Thankfully common sense kicks in and reminds me "idiot, what's the point of smoking if you don't inhale. Take that money in your pocket and throw it away, because that's what you'd be doing anyways."

That's all. I haven't broken yet, but voicing this frustration in the open holds me more accountable to myself to be better than that guy I was 148 days ago. Thanks.

This marks day 1600

Hello quitters, I haven't been on this sub for quite a while now, but I just happen to be back and happy as always to see so many new people (and some old ones too) on the journey to stop smoking.
This is probably only my third or fourth post on this subreddit. Anyways, just to check in on you guys and maybe deliver some motivation: Life is great, I now look back to back when I was smoking and I'm truly glad I quit, I probably saved up tons of money up to this point thanks to it, and I'm feeling healthier than ever, I joined a gym for the first time 1 year after quitting, and I've been at it ever since. My self confidence has gone through the roof and anxiety is basically a thing of the past. Now, I know most of these things are not JUST because I stopped smoking, and life has a lot to do with it, but I know my life wouldn't be the same had I never quit. If you are thinking about, or going through the process of quitting (be it your first time or not) just listen to me and many others in this subreddit: DO IT! it's one of the best decisions you can make and you'll be really glad you chose to stop smoking. Love you guys.

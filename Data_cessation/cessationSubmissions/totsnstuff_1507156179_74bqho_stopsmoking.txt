4 months smoke free!

I started smoking when I was 10 and became a daily smoker around 12 or 13. I smoked about a pack to a pack to 2 packs a day for over 10 years. Like most people in this sub, I've quit more times than I can count. My husband and I decided one day that we were done and I haven't had one since June 1st. I quit cold turkey and used mints to help curb my oral fixation. You can do it! If you want to quit, do it! My motivation was and is telling myself that I'm tired of quitting.

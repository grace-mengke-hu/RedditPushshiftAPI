2013, the year of transformation

Hi /r/stopsmoking. This last Friday, I've been at my parents' for the weekend while my girlfriend was staying at our apartment. I've been a smoker for about 6 years now and that day I just knew it was enough. I've got allergies which are a real pain every spring, so that night it was really, frighteningly difficult to breathe. So I decided to 'just' stop smoking. When I came home to our mutual apartment I was kind of anxious to tell my also smoker-girlfriend about my decision, she told me that she hadn't had a smoke that day and that she also decided to quit even before I told her about my decision. 

This, and the fact that I've lost close to 60 pounds (thanks to /r/keto) and have started to exercise and have severely limited my drinking makes 2013 my year of total transformation.

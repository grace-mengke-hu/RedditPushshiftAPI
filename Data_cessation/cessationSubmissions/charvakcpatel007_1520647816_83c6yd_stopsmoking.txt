No hiding

When you first kick out this habbit, the general advice is to know your triggers such as your places of smoke or alchohol or coffee.
In start, its good to avoid it since cravings are really strong.

But, after a while, you have to stop hiding.
I suggest you go and face that trigger and win.
You just can't avoud alchohol or coffee for a lifetime.
Go at the trigger, be powerful, face it and don't smoke.
After a while, you will one by one eliminate this triggers.

Don't hide from your triggers, embrace and defeat it.
Go walk past your smoking place and dont smoke
Get wasted and dont smoke.
Let your addict cry inside, let it die.

If you can win this triggers, chance of lapse decrease.
Because i have seen it happen that you avoid a trigger for a year, you have been smoke fee, then you lose against that trigger because in a year you go little careless.

Defeat triggers now and be done with it.

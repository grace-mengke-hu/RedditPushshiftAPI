I NEED motivation not to buy a pack tomorrow- Day 3

35F smoked since I was 15. Smoked a pack a day for the past 15 years. I've been having breathing difficulties and my mom was in the hospital with problems with her heart. I just decided on Wednesday I don't want to smoke anymore and quit cold turkey but ALL I think about is smoking it is so much harder said than done :(

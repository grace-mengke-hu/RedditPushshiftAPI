Doctor high-fived me

I went cold turkey 28 days ago.  I felt like I was coming apart—literally feeling like I was about to have a breakdown sitting at my desk at work.  Made a doctor’s appointment, met with the doctor, and found that my blood pressure was 140/104.  After some time with all my other concerns, I left for home and tossed my smokes out that day.  Saw my doctor today, had my blood pressure checked six times or something to be sure, and it had come down to 116/81.  My doctor jumped up and demanded a high five!  We talked for a while about how hard it is, and she said that I am her only patient that she’s ever had who has actually “done it.”  We were both really, really proud!  Had to share this small success!

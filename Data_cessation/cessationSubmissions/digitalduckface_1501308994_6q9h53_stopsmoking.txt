the day has come

After years of smoking the day has now come, on which I have finally decided to ban the cigarette permanently from my life.
I bought myself in advance nicotine patches. I just need something to ease the withdrawal.
24th of july, monday. I have vacation so monday is completely okey.
In the middle of the night at 01:40 I smoke my last self-turned cigarette. I have never turned such a perfect cigarette. A beauty. I make myself a coffee and enjoy the last togetherness. At 4:00 am I wake up. In my head lurks the addiction. Just one more.  And of course, I'm smoking one. I slept long until noon. I looked at my non-smoking app. Oxygen level and pulse rate 100%. I'm glad. I put the nicotine patch on my hip and feel confident. As agreed, I collect my tobacco utensils and hand them over to my boyfriend Juri. He said, I now throw this into the waste ok? I looked at him horrified and everything inside me shouted loudly. His first test. He told me I should do some activity, go swimming or whatever. I looked at him angrily and rushed away. Are these the withdrawal symptoms? I went upstairs to my apartment and pity myself. I spent some time on instagram. Unbelievable on how many photos cigarettes are to be seen. My mind circles. I put yesterday an almost empty tobacco pack in the wastebag. There are still a few filters on the table and paper I will find somewhere. My body worked and suddenly i was smoking.  I smoked quickly, enjoyed it no second and was annoyed about myself. My worked out 100% are now back to zero. That was the fucking last one!
To be continued.

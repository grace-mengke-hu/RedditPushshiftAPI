Going to try again today

I can never seem to stay quit for longer than 4 hours. I tried to quit Friday and lasted about 3 hours before bumming a cig off a coworker then proceeding to go buy a pack during lunch.

This will probably be my 30ish attempt to quit. I'm starting to stop feeling the need to think about all the reasons why I need to quit and have this anxious desire to just *stop*, period. No reason needed but oh so many there. I'm 24, smoke a little over a pack a day and started when I was 15. Summer next year will make a decade long relationship to this addiction. I feel so mentally weak.

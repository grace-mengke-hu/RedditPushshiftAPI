New here :) day 9!!!

Hello everyone. I'm new here and just wanted to share my quitting smoking journey so far! I actually started off by using chantix on Tuesday June 16 2015. I had my last cigarette on Saturday June 27. The first day was extremely easy for me because I was actually hung over and smoking just sounded terrible. So, instead of keeping my quit date as July 1st, I decided to make it June 27th. The cravings the following few days were not fun at all. The chantix helped out a lot from the ones you get quitting by yourself. July 2nd was a good day but I started feeling like I couldnt breath and my chest felt really tight for about a half hour after taking the chantix so I decided to stop taking it on July 3rd. Since then, I get random cravings for a cigeratte but nothing that I can't resist. I really want this because I am over smoking! I'll get to the day that I can say, its been years since I've had a cigeratte.

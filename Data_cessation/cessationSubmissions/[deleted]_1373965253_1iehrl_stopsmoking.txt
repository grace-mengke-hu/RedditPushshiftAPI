2nd Time Around :S

Hey guys, I need to quit smoking, I manged to quit almost 4 years ago and I remember how great it was, and how good I felt during, I quit for 3.5 years, but started up again when I started smoking the magic herb and in the UK, its common to do this, i think mainly for rationing due to high prices, Ive stopped the herb so i can focus on getting rid of my nicotine addiction, will continue to use the herb when Im healthy again. Will probs just eat or vap it in future (In moderation! Plant has so many benefits when not abused).

Basically im finding it way harder the 2nd time round, it doesn't help that my partner smokes, so i find myself making excuse e.g passive smoking is worse than active smoking ect, i really want my partner to stop too, but man she is like the devil when she thinks about it lol. Shes in early stages of pregnancy so i really wanna get her to stop without stressing her out to much, we've tried those E.Cigarets but no luck

Main reasons for quitting;

*Better health and well being

*Regain motivation and drive for ambitions and work

*Partner pregnant

*Want to increase chances of living longer active live for my kids

*Prevent kids from passive smoking (we dont smoke in same room as kids or near them and have a big open kitchen leading out to back garden, but i know most smoke in ciggies isn't visible)

*Dont want to be a burden on kids future due to illness relating to smoking e.g cancer, heart problems ect..

Im just really looking for help and advice from people who are trying to quit 2nd time around, i thought it would of been easier but im finding it much, much harder!

Thanks Guys

Two Weeks!

Can't believe I've made it this far! Still have some light headedness and I've been waking up very anxious most days but otherwise the cravings have abated and overall I'm feeling much better. I also do not drink and have not for almost a year now which I believe has helped make this quit successful. For those who are still in the very early stages -- hang in there! It does get better with time

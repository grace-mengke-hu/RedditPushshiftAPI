Quitting...again

So, I quit last year for 8 months. Then had a horrible trauma which caused me to pick up cigs again (really hate myself for that choice - ugh - bc here I am...again).

Anyhow, I'm back quitting again. I'm using vape (the same thing I used last time. Last time, in 8 months, I'd gone from 18mg nicotine down to 4mg), so I know this works for me.

Anyhow, I quit 2 days ago (and am vaping 18mg nicotine). So, it's early for me. I can't remember what symptoms I had last time, but I am having bad gas, I just had heartburn so bad I threw up and constipation.

Anyone else had similar? How long did the GI stuff last for you if you can recall? Thanks

So I quit smoking and now I cant stop fapping..

I quit smoking a few days ago and it seems like I replaced the habit of smoking cigarettes with touching my dick all day. Every time I want a cigarette I just rub one out instead and it seems to help, but now I cant stop. I have been awake for 3 hours this morning and I have fapped 5 times already.. I guess its a better addiction then smoking?

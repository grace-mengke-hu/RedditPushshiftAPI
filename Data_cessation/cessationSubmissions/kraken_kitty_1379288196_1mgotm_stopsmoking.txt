My Test Came Back Abnormal Again...

It might be cervical cancer.  It still hasn't sunk in completely.  My parents were over this weekend and my mum heard me when I took the call...  I cried a bit when I first heard that they wanted me to come back in to talk about the results...



I live in Canada, so health care is excellent, I'm trying to stay positive.  I'm still in shock.



Is there anyone I can talk to about this who isn't family?

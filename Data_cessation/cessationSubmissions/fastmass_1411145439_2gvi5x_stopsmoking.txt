Didn't want to post before I had a few days under my belt.

I started smoking about three years ago when I moved to Japan. Had a slight smoking habit before I got here (albeit a different sort of plant) and that, on top of other social insecurities and the dirt cheap price of tobacco over here, led me to pick up a pretty nasty habit. I quit for a month or two about two years back, but started again and have smoked about half a pack everyday for a while. I quit almost a week and a half ago and plan to keep it up. This sub has helped a lot, as well as a bet with a good friend who quit at the same time. Whoever smokes again first gets to pay the other about $300 (in yen, haha) Considering you can smoke in pretty much every bar and restaurant here in Nippon, I'm having a pretty ugly time trying to avoid the cravings. Riding the bike and some late night walks definitely helps though. I hope to see you all around and watch my own number go up. Good luck, everyone.

Day 8

And I've been having some pretty strong cravings all morning. It's been so bad I broke down and got some gum, which I normally absolutely hate. The mintiness is helping. I really want to break down. The hateful part of my brain is telling me, You're on Chantix, it's ok they say you can smoke until you're ready to stop. But then I would lose those 8 days. It would taste horrible and I would be really disappointed in myself. I'm going to power through this.

Day 15

Trying to wean myself off of posting so much on here has been a bit of a challenge... u guys r great but I cant be on here 24/7... lol.... today has been particularly trying as I set up my house for Christmas, and do my normal routine that I have been trying to neglect the past 2 weeks.... so far if only had 2 slight thoughts for a cigarette.... u know when u finish a task and sit down, have a sip of coffee.... the u reach for the cigarettes... oh hold on... something is missing.... ahh now I remember.... what do u reach for instead? Candy? Not the same.... 0% nicotine vape?  Ehh pointless.... what else?

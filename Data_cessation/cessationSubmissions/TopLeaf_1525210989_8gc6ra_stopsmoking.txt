24 years old and the healthiest I've ever been. Time to take the next step DAY 1

I joined the Gym roughly 4 months ago and since have gotten in the best shape of my life and am currently aiming to run a half marathon by the end of the year. 

We are all in this together, this is my 3rd and final attempt at quitting smoking. Good luck to me and good luck to you

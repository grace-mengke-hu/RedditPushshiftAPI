Day 3: not as bad as I expected.

I've tried quitting several times before and it's always been complete misery. This time, it's just not that bad. I mean, I'm clenching my teeth, I feel pretty on edge, and I'm drinking a lot, but I haven't considered giving up yet! I think it's because this time I actually want to quit, it's not just that I feel like I should. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not pleasant. But it's manageable. :)

I am smoke free! 111 cigs not smoked, $41 saved, & 169 hours of life regained. No NRTs I went cold turkey baby, just like the day after thanksgiving, and I have so much to be thankful for. The Smoke Free app is literally saving my life one resisted craving at a time. Be encouraged, your will is stronger than you think.

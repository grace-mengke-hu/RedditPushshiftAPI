One week in, cold turkey

And I don't feel all that bad. I didn't even miss smoking the first day or two. The cravings haven't been that bad although I turn into a police dog when I smell cigarette smoke. The weird part is that in the back of my mind, that stupid addict keeps going "Okay, it's been this many days. You're not really gonna quit forever" or "Just one won't kill you." But I tell it to shut up and I move on with my day. 

When I'm at home and a craving starts up, I spray some air freshener, chew some gum, and start crocheting, and I manage to forget all about smoking. It's only been a week and I feel like I can do anything. I'm not smelly and tired anymore. I can't believe nicotine almost made me spend more money on nicotine patches. Everyone's different, but I'm glad I didn't. I'm sure there'll be trying times, but I'll get through it and so will you.

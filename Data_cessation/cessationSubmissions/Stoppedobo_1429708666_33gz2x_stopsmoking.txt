2 Months! But hard week!

The highlight of my yesterday was the number 2 appearing in my star. I am feeling very low this week. Self confidence and esteem are low. Of course this means the junkie in my head is having a field day telling me that these feelings are smoke related. Which isn't making me feel better! Just make it harder work! As I completely get that positive is a state of mind and normally am all over the positive vibes. I find it helps with dealing anything life throws at you. So just got to snap out of it. And keep fighting the junkie. Thanks for reading! Vent over!

1 week in

Hey guys, I've recently quit smoking cigs, 2 years after I quit smoking pot, and a year after I quit drinking heavily. It hasn't been hard, per se, however, it has been the most infuriating week of my life. I've snapped my smartphone in half, went off on a coworker twice last week, and I've succumbed to road rage once. While I was smoking, this was never an issue, I was calm and collected, and easy going. I haven't had an issue controlling the urge to smoke, however, I have considered smoking again just to ease my mood. 

I'm a single, 24 year old, who loves sailing and building guitars, however, I no longer live near water, or have the tools to build guitars, so my trusted methods of stress and anger relief are ineffective. I need some ideas for new things to try to keep my mind off of things, preferably social activities with a low initial investment, and physical activities to reduce the chance that I'll be around smokers.

Thanks in advanced guys.

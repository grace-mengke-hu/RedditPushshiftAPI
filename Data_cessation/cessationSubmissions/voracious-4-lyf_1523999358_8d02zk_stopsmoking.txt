Cigarette smoker to running again

I’ve been off to cigarettes (cold turkey) for almost two weeks. Yesterday, I was craving a cigarette so badly that I decided to distract myself by going running. I ended up doing about 6kms and I definitely didn’t want a cigarette by the time I was done! What was even better is that later that night, my old friend came over and asked if I wanted to come outside for a smoke and I proudly declared, without thinking, that “I don’t smoke anymore.” Just wanted to tell you all, if you’re feeling doubts in your ability to say no to the nicotine, just stay strong and do something to distract yourself... you’ll feel so much better for saying ‘no’ than giving in.

Almost a year.

I wanted to wait for my first post til I hit one year, but it seems like that is not going to happen. I have failed.  I made it 309 days without touching a cigarette. I took a drag on a trash run at work, and it steam rolled from there.  I failed myself. I convinced myself that it was ok to keep smoking.

Until today.  I went and got the gum.  Cold turkey doesn't seem to work for me, so now it's time to try something else.  Here's to posting again in a year and having been smoke free!

Question about soar throat after quitting

Hiya guys,

so I quit smoking cold-turkey 11 days ago now. For the past two days I've had a really soar throat, especially in the mornings. I was wondering if anyone knows if this is something that is caused by the quitting, or whether I am maybe just getting ill?

Thanks

How long does it take to negate the effects of smoking?

That is to say, if I smoke one cigarette, how long does it take after that before my body is 'normal/free of gunk'. And similarly, can I just multiply this number straight? So If I smoke 5 a day for 3 months, how long should it take for my body to be back to normal? Cheers

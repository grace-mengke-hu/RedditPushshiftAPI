Day 1, Smoker for 9 years, Nervous

Today is day 1. In about 10 days I am going to get my wisdom teeth removed and the surgeon told me I need to quit for at least one week before and one week after. I decided that at age 27, this is the perfect time to stop all together.

I have bought mini nicorette lozenges and am planning on buying a journal where I can log everything and anything relating to this process/journey.

I'm on a positive kick lately and trying to make this last. However I'm feeling so nervous about it. Any extra tips?

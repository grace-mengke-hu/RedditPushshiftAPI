A Night Out with friends that are Smokers, a little nervous

I have had no issues staying off since going "cold turkey" in October thanks to Easy Way. My SO used patches for a few months and has now been nicotine free for a week.  As the title explains,  we will be drinking with friends tomorrow night that smoke. I believe that there is no such thing as "just one" but any tips or reminders to help me keep in mind that I DO NOT WANT TO SMOKE would be very much appreciated!

Sleeping a LOT since quitting

Anyone else get the feeling they could sleep 12-16 hours a day since quitting? I thought insomnia was the biggest thing for people who quit. Not excessive sleepiness.

Since I stopped a few days ago, all I can do it seems is sleep, constantly. I've been sleeping a minimum 12 hours and sometimes 15-16 hours a day. 

Just trying to see if this is the lack of cigarettes, or something else and I should be seeing a doctor? It's hard to say because I've on and off always dealt with fatigue issues throughout my life, but never to this extreme extent. Also I have quit taking my Adderall prescription BUT before everyone says there's your culprit, I quit that a solid two and a half weeks ago. You'd think the worst would be over right now right?

Anyways, yeah if anyone could point me in the right direction and help me realize if this is or isn't from quitting smoking, that'd be great. And no worries, if I'm told this is a normal part of the withdrawal from nicotine, I'm not going to relapse. I just want to know what I'm dealing with so I know what the cause is and can remind myself it's temporary rather than worrying it may be something else.

I get constipated when I try quitting, any tips?

Hey guys,  
I get constipated when I try quitting and it gets pretty miserable.  
Any tips on how to maintain a good BM schedule without tobacco? I also already have a really good diet, work out plenty, and drink a lot of water - so any tips other than that?  
Thanks in advance!

Need information and resources.

My wife and I are trying to quit smoking and are trying chantix however, we do not have insurance and the cost is around 300 dollars per person, per prescription.  The pharmacy where we do business has a program that would allow 50 dollars to be taken off and chantix has a mail in rebate, but it still only lowers the cost to around two hundred dollars.  Are there any resources that could reduce this cost lower than the hundred dollar mark?

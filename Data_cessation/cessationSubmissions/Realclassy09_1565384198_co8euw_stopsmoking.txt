Tips on quitting smoking?

I'm quitting smoking. So far I've smoked at 3am and again about 13 hours later at 4:30pm. (I work 3rd shift so I've slept most of the day) No one has anything positive to say about me quitting. I have the next 3 days off, really stressing that I quit by Monday. I go through almost a pack a day! Any tips at all or positive notes are welcome!!

Haven't slept right since quitting and I'm exhausted

I won't smoke as it's not worth it but I am so exhausted. I can get to sleep fine but I only stay asleep for an hour before I'm wide awake and then have to try and force myself to go back to sleep, this happens nearly ever 1-2 hours and it's driving me crazy. At night everything seems really lonely and I'm laying there tired and bored out of my mind, knowing tomorrow I'll be so tired. I used to smoke occassionally in the middle of the night so I'm guessing it's my body wanting nicotine (maybe??)

Does anyone know how to fix this? I don't have cravings as I just vape but maybe I am as I can't sleep? My doctors don't give out sleeping pills and I don't know if thats a good idea too as I'm scared of coming dependent on them. Has this happened to you?

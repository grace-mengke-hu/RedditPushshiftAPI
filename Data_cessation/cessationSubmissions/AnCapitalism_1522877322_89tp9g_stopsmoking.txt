Smoking is Selfish

Sometimes we get so caught up having pity for ourselves we forget who all is affected by addiction. Not only am I spending money on cigarettes, but I'm not paying bills I ought to pay, or buying things I should buy, with the money I'm depending on cigarettes. One may hardly make himself the argument, "Well, all my bills are being paid, and I'm eating well, etc.," for this is an attack on his psyche evidence of the monster of addiction itself, and how dangerous it has become to his decision-making process. What else is life and finances than paying bills, eating, and providing what is necessary for oneself? Should he have afforded all these things and only then buy cigarettes, he is still guilty of not giving to the poor. 





It's not a question of whether or not You're being responsible with all other areas of Your lives. Smoking cigarettes is irresponsible period. You labor for money in order to buy cigarettes. That same time spent laboring could have been spent with Your children. Instead not only have You wasted time presently, but You also expect a shorter life and chronic psychical illness which costs You time as well. 




Present Your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is Your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of Your mind... Romans 12:1-2





The one who made You wants You to turn from Your addiction. It doesn't matter whether or not You believe me. You're responsible for Your own behavior, and there are consequences to Your actions.

i'm really disappointed in my self

It's 19th of January and already i've tried to quit three times... Last year every month i tried to quit. Today was going to be the day. I was preparing myself last night, reading all the posts the books and so on. But this morning i forgot it all. Mornings are the worst. I have so many things on my mind all day until i sleep and when i get up in the morning i have forgotten them and for a brief moment i feel happy again in my bliss -  until a few seconds later when they come back to me with the weight of a thousand tonnes. That's when i reach for a cigarette. It has become a way of avoiding reality. Today i woke up and run to the store in the cold weather fixating on the cigarettes all the way. i really want to quit but i cant keep my resolve. It seems so easy to make decisions when i'm smoking but so easy to forget them when I'm not. I guess i have not accepted my situation in life and i cling to a dream of "everything will be allright". But it won't. eventually i will get cancer like my sister or copd like my father... I really need to change my life but i don't have the willpower to do so... what am i doing wrong?

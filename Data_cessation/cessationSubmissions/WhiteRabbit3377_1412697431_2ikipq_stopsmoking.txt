Weird Question....

Hey All,  

   I know everyone's experience & body are different, but I've been a non-smoker for going on 8 days now and haven't had the cold/phlegm attacks that I commonly hear about.

Is this odd? Gross question, but I was kind of wondering if it will randomly hit me at some point.

Thanks!

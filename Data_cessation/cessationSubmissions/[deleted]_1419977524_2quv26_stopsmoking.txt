Extremely nauseous and drowsy after going cold-turkey -- normal?

I went cold turkey a few days ago, but ever since then I've been extremely nauseous (I don't have the urge to vomit, but I get disorienting lurches in my head/body when I walk around; it also inhibits my ability to workout), drowsy (I feel I got mono or something, I'm just tired - but not sleepy - all the time), and crippled with a lack of motivation (I feel like nothing stimulates me). I figured there would be consequences to treating your body like shit, but I just wanted to know if this is a normal sequence of symptoms when you quit. Pretty tough.

Thanks.

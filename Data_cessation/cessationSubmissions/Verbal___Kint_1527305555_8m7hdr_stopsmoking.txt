Almost done with day 6 (first day at work)

The last time I told myself I quit, I didn't make it through an hour at work, after 5 days without. I work in a casino where most of the customers and half the employees smoke. I'm currently closing in at 6 hours at work without one. 2 hours to go. This might just work.

I smoke when I'm sad but I want to stop

Hi! I've been reading a lot of posts about people who have quit smoking. Congrats to you all! I'm trying to do the same. How did you all do it?  I've thought about using an app to help me quit. Are there smoking cessation apps or other programs you recommend?  I usually smoke when I am depressed or feeling anxious. Fellow smokers with depression-are there any apps out there to help you manage both?

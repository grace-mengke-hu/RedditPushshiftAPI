How did you 1) replace your habits and 2) start to think of yourself as a nonsmoker? 3) Has anyone made a lot of other changes at the same time?

Smoking is woven into my day, punctuates everything I do. It's going to be great to have more time, but I'm not clear on how I'm going to manage it, if you know what I mean. Just so used to smoking after eating, while doing creative activities, if I want a break from a party that's getting to be too much, etc. 

Like it's easy enough to snack on carrots or use a rubber band or breathing to get past a craving, but I think using *time* in a different way is sort of different. I think it involves different coping strategies for different things (like leaving a party for air/a break from stimulation). Is there a list somewhere of coping techniques for different kinds of things? I mean I'm sure there is, there's just so much info it's just overwhelming to parse to get to that aspect. 

Thinking about changing up where I go / how I spend my free time. I'm basically a homebody - maybe I should hang out at coffee shops or the park more often? All the places I've been avoiding because I can't smoke there... It's just so different from what's comfortable (good thing! Weird thing, too).

I'm thinking about making a major overhaul at once. I know people say not to do that, but I think making some dietary changes and adding exercise at the same time might be good distraction. Also really want to prevent weight gain and maybe even lose... 

I know from past quits that I'll have a lot more energy and just feel better, so maybe I'll be more motivated to get out. Am kind of introverted, though. 

Also, just thinking of myself as a nonsmoker in a way opens up ideas about what else I could do/be, in a way. But I don't know what to put there, if you know what I mean.

Ideas?

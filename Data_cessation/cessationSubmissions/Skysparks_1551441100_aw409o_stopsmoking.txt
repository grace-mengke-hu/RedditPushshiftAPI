Quitting after a 2 month relapse

After relapsing into smoking again just before Christmas last year, I've finally kicked the habit. Three and a half of my remaining packs, two of which were unopened, have gone in the bin and my lighters are next to be gone.

Couldn't handle the yellowing of my teeth, growing numbness in my chest and, interestingly, the deep zits that were showing up randomly in places I never got them when I wasn't smoking. 

I plan to replace the bad habit with listening to music, chewing gum and excercise. All the best fellow quitters!

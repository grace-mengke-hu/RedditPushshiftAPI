Cannot sleep because of shortness of breath, chest tightness

Please take the time to read this, I had my 'last' cigarette on November 25 but relapsed and smoked once this 1st of December and that's when it all happened until now, the problem didn't began until I went to sleep when suddenly I woke up from sleep because my brain somehow noticed that I forgot to breath, I don't think I have sleep apnea since this only happened very recently, I was already able to sleep that time on 6am in the morning and woke up in the afternoon, didn't really notice it until I was going to bed now that I feel like someone is sitting on my chest and even though I can inhale completely I still feel like I'm catching on breathe and took me in the morning when I was able to sleep. Was so anxious the whole night thinking it could have been heart failure (because of google), pneumonia, asthma or I'm probably gonna be dead before this weekend.

I posted this here since I also googled some infos and videos regarding some issues about some withdrawal symptoms from quitting smoking and most of them are rings the bell. 

TL;DR but please read :c : felt all of these when I had a (just one) smoke after not smoking for 6 days, smoked one stick the next day too, and now don't even wanna have smoke anymore since I feel like shit and it's no surprise if this symptoms are what going to make me push through quitting since I wanna be all done with this and not look back. I also vape.

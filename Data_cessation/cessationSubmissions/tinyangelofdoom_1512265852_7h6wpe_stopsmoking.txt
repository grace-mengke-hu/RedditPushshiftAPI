40 days in and just rewarded my lungs with cupping!

Hi ya'll! I am 40 days into my final quit and feeling very committed. I've been frustrated with respiratory inflamation and always needing to clear my throat, etc. I have been drinking tea and exercising but a good friend recommended cupping to stimulate healing in my lungs and encouraging excess mucus expectorant. I feel a lot of sinus drainage and have had very productive coughs so far. feeling hopeful!

Also, not super into arguing with anyone who wants to tell me cupping or other TCM is bull shit, so miss me with that :)

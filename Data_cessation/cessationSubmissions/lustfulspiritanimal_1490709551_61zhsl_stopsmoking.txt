Trying to think of out-of-the-box ideas. What are yours?

They are probably just out-of-the-box for me, but so far I have

- transfer $9 to my savings everytime I want to go buy a pack
- keep almonds and such in random places around the house. 
- removed all lighters except the long one for the fireplace.
- do a few laps up and down the stairs if it gets bad.
- bought an extra thick pillow to scream into.

I feel like this list could be improved. What do you do?

Story time: Oh the places you'll go (and never smoke again)

Yesterday was particularly out of the ordinary. 

12:01am I was leaving the South Side Ballroom all energized from the Faith No More concert. (non smoking venue, thankfully).

It's roughly a 30 minute drive to my house. 

Packed a day bag for my upcoming trip. 

1:00am sleep. 

6:00am wake up, shower, head to airport.

7:55am kiss wife goodbye for the week, charge through the smokers in front of the terminal, TSA always on my case about something. I opt out.

8:00am board my flight to head to indianapolis.

8:05am someone is in my seat. they ask if I mind switching so they can work with their traveling companion (both window seats so i don't mind)

8:10am take off

8:25am laptops come out, I look ahead and notice that the people I allowed to sit together are working up the ad campaign for a new Marlboro/Car ad. I couldn't make out the car brand, my guess is audi. (what a thing, if i had stuck to my guns i could have delayed their evil plans for 2 hours, but noon, I'm too kind)

8:30a watch rick and morty to center myself.

11:00a land in indianapolis. no checked luggage so I head straight to the car rental.

11:15a im "preferred member" so i just walk to a car get in and go.

11:20a-1:30p I drive 2 hours north to my first meeting (this is where the cravings start killing me) I drive a lot for work, I used to smoke every 5 mins or 10 miles which ever was longer (a deal I made with myself once i realized i would chain smoke if i didn't watch it). But luckily having no cigarettes with me, i was unable to smoke at this time.

1:30p-3:00p had day job related meeting. nailed it.

3:00p noticed I was close (80 miles) from a recently added customer, so I called them up and asked if I could come say hello. Drove the 90 mins to see them (again cravings hanging all around like flies trapped in the car)

4:30p walk into customers store, shake hands, thanks for the business, customer loves the equipment. leave.

4:35p begin 2.5 hour drive back to Indianapolis where my hotel will be for the night. This time I'm prepared with a 4 pack of redbull. at a pace of approximately 1 every 45 mins I drink the redbulls and my cravings don't flare up. 

7:00pm arrive at hotel.

*edit* moved following section and titled it TL;DR

TL;DR: 13 hour day, 6 hours spent driving, 2 in-flight, 1.5 in a meeting. 3 empty redbulls. 0 cigarettes purchased, 0 smoked. Celebrate with more Rick and Morty.

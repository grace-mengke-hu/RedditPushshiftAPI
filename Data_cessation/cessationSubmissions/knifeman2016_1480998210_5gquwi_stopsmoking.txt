Need help.

I've recent come to terms I'm a tobacco addict and I need to quit for my health. I have chewed about a can of dip every five days to a week for 8 months. I've tried cigarettes but Ive only had a handful in my life. I've tried doing it cold turkey but I've cracked several times. What should I do? Buy Nicorette?

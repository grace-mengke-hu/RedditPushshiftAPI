Fuck the Zero

The most important number in my life right now is the number of days since I quit smoking. As of this morning that's four. The bigger the number gets the more it frightens me, because I know all it takes is one smoke to go back to zero. Most people see fear as a weakness. It can be.  I have to be ruthless with myself because failure is not an option.   I have to use my fear, it makes me stronger. Like everyone else in the subreddit, I can control the zero...Fuck the zero.

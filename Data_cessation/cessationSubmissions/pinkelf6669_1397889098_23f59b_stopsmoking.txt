Lurked for a while, been "quitting" even longer. Think I'm finally ready to quit for good.

19 M here. Been casually smoking (one or 2 every once in a while when drinking) since about 11th grade, went down south for college and picked it up more when I realized how much cheaper it is down here. That plus having a majority of the bars/clubs allowing smoking indoors led to me smoking a pack every 2 days or so. Stopped picking up packs about a month ago, and can usually go anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks without bumming one off someone. I had initial withdrawal symptoms when I quit at first, but each time after I don't really get them. More of a "hey, might as well" type thing if that makes sense. I've done a fair share of coke this semester and that always triggered my "hey a cig would be cool right now" thinking but I decided that tonight was the last time I'd do coke. Hoping that will make the quitting process easier. Drinking is hit or miss for me, some times I'll be asking everyone in sight if they have a smoke and some times I won't even think about it. I know I slipped up a few times but I realized that it shouldn't drag me down, cause we're all human and fuck up from time to time. Learning from my mistakes is definitely helping me better myself in the long run. I'm gonna get a badge and use that as some motivation to quit, I got a few loose cigs in my apartment and tomorrow morning I'm gonna break em and drench em in water. I know I'm capable of doing this and want to finally be able to while I'm young. Life's too awesome to be dragged down by this shit. Feel free to PM me if anyone's having a rough time. A lot of my friends down here don't smoke so whenever I talk to them about quitting they give me the whole "It's not that fuckin hard just do it" bullshit, which is annoying but I don't blame em cause they don't know what it's like. Hope to contribute more here in the future.

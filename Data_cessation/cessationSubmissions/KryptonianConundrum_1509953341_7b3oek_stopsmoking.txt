51 days smoke-free... but...

...but the last couple of days I've been craving to light up so bad :( I keep reminding myself of all the reasons why I wanted to quit in the first place. Doing everything to keep me in check, but I feel like I'm getting to a point where I'd give anything to have another smoke. I'm so aware of everything, Allen Carr (re-read it), aware of Not Another Puff Ever... Aware of the fact that if I have 1, I'll relapse. But DAMN! I REALLY AM REACHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO :(

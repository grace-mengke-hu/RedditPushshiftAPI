Quitting for this little munchkin :)

I've been smoking for 13 years, starting when I was 17. I'm not a social smoker, or even a casual smoker, I smoke all the time. When I'm not smoking I'm thinking of the next cigarette, and when I am smoking I'm thinking of little else. I buy a carton of 200 at the start of the week and without fail, aside from the one I save for Monday morning, they're all gone by Sunday night. I usually work from home and the convenience and habitual smoking usually means I don't go much longer than 15 minutes without lighting-up.  


When I was pregnant I got down to 2 or 3 cigarettes a day with the aid of nicotine gum and patches (vaping hadn't really caught on at that point) and a hell of a lot of chocolate! But as soon as my daughter was born I went straight back to smoking regularly, something I still feel guilty about every day.


I'll be 31 in a few weeks, but sometimes I feel about 60. I get tired easily, and if I start breathing heavily from running around or playing with my daughter I cough and it hurts my chest - but I know these are only mild inconveniences compared to the risks I'm running in the long term. 


My friend lent me Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking, and it's been an enlightening read. I'm currently 15 hours in, had my last cigarette at 11pm last night and it's currently 3:24pm the next day. I feel like I'm losing my mind, I feel weirdly tingly and light headed, and I'm chewing through enough sweets to feed an army, but this is it, I no longer smoke! :)

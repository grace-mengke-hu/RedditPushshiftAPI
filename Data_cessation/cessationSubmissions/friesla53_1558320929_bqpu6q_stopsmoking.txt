Smoking stinks

Smoking absolutely stinks, literally. I was at a horse show today and there were people around me smoking from time to time. The smell was horrific. Hard to believe I found that enjoyable. So glad I’m 108 days into the smoke free journey and feel absolutely terrific. Thanks to all of you here for helping to make this possible —and the Smokefree app (though I still can’t figure out how to post that progress here). Lol.

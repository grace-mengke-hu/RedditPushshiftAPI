I quit smoking.

Hi fellow quitters :)

I have been a Redditor for a while and am SO glad to find out today that this subreddit exists. :D

I'm 27/f, have had asthma since childhood, and was diagnosed with PCOS and Hypothyroidism about 2 weeks ago. This was a huge wake-up call for me to get rid of bad lifestyle habits, most importantly smoking, and become a healthier individual in general.

I want to stay determined to never pick up smoking as a habit again and I hope this sub will be of great help!

I'm loosing track of time

So I thought I was over day 4....turned out it was day 5 that was closing so now I'm on day 6. Shows what I know now doesn't it?

I really wish I could say I'm doing better.....which I mean by smell it is better and my skin is better. My cats love me to death because I don't smell like smoke anymore. I love that part to death but the impulsivity is coming out.

The rocking is still there
The irritability is there....getting verbally out of control. I just literally go off on anybody for saying 1 thing. I know part of that is normal but wowsiers!

Our last 40 bucks...till payday on thursday...I JUST BLEW!  On junk food for tonight. Now that I got home, I really don't see how great it is now. I really don't. We needed gas too and I didn't care at the time. My husband said he understood ya know the new years eve and all but that now he has to borrow money from a friend just for gas. I feel like crap! I didn't even think of that!

Saying screw my diet I don't freaking care! Which I should considering I have pcos....with hormone imbalance and insulin resistance and increased risk of stroke/heart attack but fuck it gain weight anyway carbs are awesome.

How can I handle this? I don't like what I'm becoming! I'm still taking my meds but it feels like this isn't me.

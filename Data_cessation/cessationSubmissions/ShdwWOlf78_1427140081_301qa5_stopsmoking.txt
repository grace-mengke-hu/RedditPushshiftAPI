I saw a post a few months ago in /r/everythingscience regarding this extract that was supposedly better than Chantix, and safer as well.  Well, I bought it.  Took forever to arrive, as the only place you could get it from is Bulgaria, but I am now 6 weeks, 3 days, 18 hours and oh...45 minutes smoke free.  This is by far the EASIEST time I've ever had quitting smoking (and I've tried quitting a lot), the cravings have been nil...and I was actually able to stop taking the stuff long before I was supposed to.  If you have issues with willpower, I hope you read this.  Tabex works.

Day 24 still going strong, just one issue...

SLEEPING. i'm still not sleeping, its coming on 4 weeks and my sleep is still very disjointed and horrid! I seem to wake up every few hours, usually from quite vivid dreams. Any help on getting a good nights sleep?

Also, the last few days have been really tough! felt like i've been stuck on day 3 for the last few days, getting strong cravings and back to thinking about smoking a lot! its clearly affecting my sleep!

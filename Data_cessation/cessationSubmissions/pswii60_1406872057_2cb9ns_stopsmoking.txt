Over three weeks! I've sacrificed for this and it's worth it.

About a week after my quit date there was a show at a new venue right near my house. I wanted to go to see my friends and enjoy the music but I knew everyone would be smoking (they always are). I knew if I hung out at this place all night I would inevitably cave in, so I stayed home and missed out. At this point I figure if I start up again, missing the show (and other stuff) was a waste. This is now a source of motivation for me, which is something I didn't expect.

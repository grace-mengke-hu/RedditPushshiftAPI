4 days w/o a cigarette

Been smoking around a pack a day since I was 18 - 27 now. So 9 years of smoking a pack a day. 


It's offically been 4 days now since I've touched a cigarette, and I caved in today. I went outside - lit up a cigarette and simply just puffed on it. I didn't inhale it at all, not even once. I just wanted the act of smoking...i had to throw it mid way through because I was afraid I'd actually start inhaling soon. 

Did this fuck everything up ?

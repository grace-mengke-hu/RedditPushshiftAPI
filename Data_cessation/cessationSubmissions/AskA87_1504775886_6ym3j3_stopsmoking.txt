Fell for it - again

So I wrote on this sub a couple of months ago about wanting to quit.I went for a week or so then I caved in once again.It's not the nicotine that fucks me up,I don't crave the cigarette itself,it's just the feeling when it rasps your throat that i missed the most,and that made me fall again.Any suggestion for my next shot at it?Something that stops me from craving that specific feeling

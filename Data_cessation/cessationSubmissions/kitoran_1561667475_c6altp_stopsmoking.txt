Euphoria is wearing off

I'm 2 months 20 days in. I used to think about what a great achievement it is to quit smoking and it made me feel good about myself. Now i'm just kinda 'meh'. A friend i used to smoke with cut me off last summer and everything's just sad. On the other hand, i no longer get out of breath after 5 minutes of cardio.

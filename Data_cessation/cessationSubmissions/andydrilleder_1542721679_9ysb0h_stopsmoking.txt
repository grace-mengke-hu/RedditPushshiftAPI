Smoke free, One year today.

If I can do it, anyone can. I smoked for 29 years. One close call about 3 months ago after a couple screwdrivers, but I toughed it out and didn't cave. Last time I quit I made it 6 months, then had one while camping. Then I smoked for the next 6 years. Good luck to all of you!

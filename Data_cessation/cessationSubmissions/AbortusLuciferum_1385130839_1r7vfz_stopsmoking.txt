People who quit a long time ago, what brings/keeps you here?

I would imagine that after a while without a cigarette you should get used to being a nonsmoker, so this quitting business should only rarely be on your mind. Does the experience of having quit cigarettes stick with you? I mean, I hope that once I'm a year without smoking I can forget everything related to my smoking days, even this quitting part, and leave it all behind. I mean, it's great that you long time quitters are helping us and motivating us and all, but I'm curious as to why.

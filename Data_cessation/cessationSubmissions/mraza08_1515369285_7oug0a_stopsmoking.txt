Almost over a week, Am I saved from the devil stick?

its my 8th day smoke-free after 18 years of smoke-life,  It is my first time going this far, last year I tried but only went two days and relapsed.......I hv quit cold-turkey and dont have a lot of carvings, just sometimes I get the urge to go and get a cig but when that happens I come at this sub and read other topics, it helps me a lot to fight the urge...I slept almost all the days and nights during last 5 days, is it normal? What else can I expect to happen? is nicotine out of my system? I was thinking a lot of sh..t is going to happen when nicotine withdrawn started but all seems normal so far.  Am I saved?

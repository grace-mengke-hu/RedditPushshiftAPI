Today is the day. Need advice.

Today, I planned to stop smoking. Today I will. I have patches that I got for free, but I will try to avoid using them for now, but if it proves unbearable, at least I have them to fall back on. But I'm thinking, am I preparing to fail by having them? Should I try cold turkey instead? Please give me any advice.

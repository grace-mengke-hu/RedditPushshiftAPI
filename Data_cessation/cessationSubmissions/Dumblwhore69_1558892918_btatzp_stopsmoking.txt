How are you feeling?

I love the support of this sub, but the most inspiring thing for me is reading specific positive changes people are experiencing as a direct result of quitting (i.e, easier to breathe, food/coffee tasting better). 

So if you would, how far into your quit are you and whatâ€™s your favorite side effect so far?

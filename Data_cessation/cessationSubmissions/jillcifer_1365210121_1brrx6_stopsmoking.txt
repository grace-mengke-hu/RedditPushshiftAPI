Pregnant, having a hard time quitting smoking.

I just need some help quitting. I've gone down from a pack a day to 4-6 smokes a day but feel like a total asshole. Any advice? I feel like I've tried everything to stop. 

Edit: Please be helpful and not condescending or judgmental or try to guilt trip me. Snarky comments are pointless.

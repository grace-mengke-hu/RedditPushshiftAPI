Celebrating three months!

I'm celebrating three months entirely nicotine free today and wanted to share my journey and some encouragement to everyone here. I quit cigarettes a couple of years ago and switched to vaping which was a huge step in itself. That being said the nicotine was still in charge and what started as a quitting aid became just as much a habit as the cigarettes had been before it.

What made up my mind this time was that I became aware of the long term situation. It was clear to me that I couldn't control my usage, if I ran out of e-liquid I would hardly hesitate to pick up a pack of cigarettes until I got my next shipment. I could see how every cigarette or vape session was a choice and I wasn't just choosing a short moment of satisfaction, I was choosing every single one after that. I could see two paths, continue using nicotine for the rest of my life and go out in agony or stop now and hope that it wasn't too late already.

With this newfound clarity of my mortality and how much control I had over it I decided to just throw away all my vape equipment. First few days where hardest as usual, but it felt easier than quitting cigarettes. I guess that's because I was just getting over one addictive substance instead of many. [This page](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html) helped me out a lot, every time I got an urge I would look up how far I had made it and what I could look forward to if I didn't give in. Slowly the urges became fewer and fewer, now I can go many days without even thinking about it.

TLDR; Find your reason for quitting and stick to it, you can do it!

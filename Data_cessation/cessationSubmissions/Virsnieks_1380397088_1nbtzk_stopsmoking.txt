Day 1 again, I need a stop smoking buddy

Hi,
I have tried to quitt lately tonns of times but I relapse again and again. Maybe stop smoking buddy could help?
I'm 27 (soon to be 28) Smoking expierence ~10 years.
I'm located in Northern Europe. Maybe we can help each other to get to 90 days and then be free rst of our lives from smoking.

I'm really tired of this shit and I want to be free from smoking.

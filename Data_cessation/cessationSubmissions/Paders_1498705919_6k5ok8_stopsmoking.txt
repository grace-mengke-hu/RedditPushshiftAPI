Stressed, looking for motivation.

Same old song and dance: Stress is making me want to relapse.

What motivated me last time was hearing about why people were quitting, but this time I'd like to hear all about the 'little' things that you've experienced since quitting. Personally my sense of taste and smell has gone way up and that's been awesome!

Thanks /r/SM!

it's been well over a 100 days

i quit cold turkey, not even a single puff. it's the best decision i've made towards my health. honestly, i don't even remember what a cigarette used to taste like, but i do remember the days i couldn't breathe properly and coughing so much in the night i that i couldnt sleep. i'm glad those days are over, it's amazing how a smoker for 5 years can heal so much in 100 days.

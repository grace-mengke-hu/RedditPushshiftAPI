As of tomorrow morning, I will no longer be a smoker.

Hey guys, I'm new to the sub. I'm 19, been smoking since I was 15, and I'm realizing now how bad this garbage is for my health...

Today, I had an asthma attack. I haven't had an asthma attack since I was around 9 years old. It scared me - that cigarettes have taken such a hold on me, that it's made me have an attack that I haven't had in 10 years. It's morbid.

It also isn't helping me feel any better. I used to just pick one up because I was stressed or sad, now I can't even have a cup of coffee or go for a drive without having one. It's just gotten out of control.

I'm still young, I don't need these things controlling my life longer than they already have. So, as of tomorrow, when my pack is finished, that's it. I'm not going to buy another pack. I'll even hide my cash if I have to so I don't have the urge to buy any more. 

I've done it before for a few days (obviously didn't last), but I want this to be permanent now. I want to be in control! 

(Sorry for the rambling)

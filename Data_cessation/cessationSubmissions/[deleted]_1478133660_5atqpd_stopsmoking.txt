Around 2weeks + in (thoughts...)

I feel very happy with myself. I know I'm never going back. I know the nature of addiction and nicotine, completely, to ever convince myself that I enjoy it anymore. 
I won't lie, it gets tough sometimes. Since I also live with a smoker.
But I've trained my mind to not be around smokers, anymore, at all. And avoid being in situations where there is smoking. Not because I'm afraid of relapsing, but the smell, the smoke, the nicotine...It's all very disgusting. One big poison. Smells bad, feels worse.
Sometimes I get a craving. It's a tough craving. But they are way, way easier than before. I feel happy that I'm beating this. But I feel sad that I ever started. Smoking is more than just a bad addiction. It's a disease. That takes over your mind and body...makes you weak, slower, dumber. I feel sad that I ever started. I feel sad that I ever convinced myself to smoke. It lead me down a dark path for a few years, since it lead to some other bad decisions. I wish I never started. I wish I quit years ago, when I told myself I would. How did I lie to myself for so long?
Well, its a learning process at least. Plus that stuff they say, about how when you beat an addiction, your will power grows?
That sounds cool and I hope it's true. I guess more than anything a persons confidence and self-respect grows. That might be it. One things for sure though, If I ever do have children, I'd be a great teacher, due to the mistakes I've made and the experience gained. At least that's worth something.
I don't know. I hope things get better for me soon.

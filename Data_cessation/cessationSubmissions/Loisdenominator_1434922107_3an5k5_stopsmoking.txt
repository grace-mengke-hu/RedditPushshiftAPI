Tomorrow it'll be 2 years

and I'll be celebrating by not smoking :)

Long are the days where a cigarette punctuated every occasion of happiness, sadness, boredom, etc. I am so far removed from my smoking self, you know, the one who smoked 21 years of her life and thought that I was destined to be a smoker for life - I find it difficult to comprehend that I put off smoking for so long.

There is really nothing to fear and everything to gain.

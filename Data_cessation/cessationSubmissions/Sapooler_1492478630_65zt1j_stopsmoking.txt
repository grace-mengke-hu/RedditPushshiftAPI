So scared

I'm new here. I've smoked a pack a day plus  for 24 years. Every night I go to bed saying that tomorrow is "the" day, the day I'll be a non smoker. I quit every day. It's so frustrating. Why does this one thing have such a hold over me? Why does it scare me to quit. I know I dread the withdrawals but surely I can be stronger. I don't think I'll ever be completely ready,  so what will it take for me? What will be the last straw for me?  I can't figure it out. I want to quit, I just don't know how or where to find my willpower and self control. Thanks for listening to my rant.

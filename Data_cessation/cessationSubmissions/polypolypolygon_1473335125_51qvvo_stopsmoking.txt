Possible to quit without crankiness?

I was wondering what people's experience was with the first few days and weeks. Were you incredibly irritable or did you manage to stay positive? If so, how did you manage with all the negative emotions withdrawal seems to bring out? 

I feel like I develop a super short fuse. Just wondering what other people's experience were.

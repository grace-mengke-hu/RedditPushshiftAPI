The Obligatory "I've Had Enough Post"

I'm sure that posts like this can get old, but in the spirit of opening myself up to a community for support in my endeavor, I'll just say it.  "Enough is enough.  I don't want to smoke cigarettes anymore."

Looking back on my life, smoking is really the only thing I regret.  I've been smoking for about 6 years now, and I still remember the (stupid) circumstances that started me on the path to addiction.  I had just gone through a rough breakup and for one reason or another, thought "cigarettes.  Yeah, that'll show her."  Oh well, the reasons for starting are rather irrelevant.  The fact of the matter is, I started.

Anyways, I've tried to quit and failed more times than I can count.  Whenever I've relapsed, I have realized that my brain executed some incredible mental gymnastics to get me to that point.  I'm sure you're all familiar with this.  And I keep justifying it to myself by saying things like, "OK, next week.  This week is no good."  "How about the first of the next month.  Nothing like a new month to start quitting!"  Etc, etc...

I'm tired of making excuses.  I'm tired of delayed.  So on a whim (well sort of a whim, I've been wanting to quit for a long time), I destroyed my cigarettes this evening in another attempt.  I think being active on this subreddit and ranting and raving when I need to will help me.

And while I'm quitting cigarettes, I'm going to stop smoking weed as well.  At least for a while.  I've been smoking a bit much, and I feel like clearing my lungs of EVERYTHING all at once could do me some good.

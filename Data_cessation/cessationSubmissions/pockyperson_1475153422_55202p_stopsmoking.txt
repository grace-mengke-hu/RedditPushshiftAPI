Keep the faith

Lil over three weeks in, wanted to check in. Quitting smoking is hard and then it's easy. I smoked a pack a day for ten years, started at 16, quit cold turkey.  Many former attempts with nicotine subs like the patch.


A couple things were crucial in the first week of my quit: 

—[cinnamon tea tree toothpicks](https://www.amazon.com/Tea-Tree-Therapy-Toothpicks-Cinnamon/dp/B000WUFCY2).  Quitting didn't get rid of my oral fixation, and chewing toothpicks makes you look like marlon brando. 

—I downloaded three separate quit smoking apps and lived at [whyquit.com](http://whyquit.com/).  Whyquit is pretty dogmatic/intense—which is what I needed, because withdrawal was intense. 

—Running!  I tried to run every day, but it was rough on my joints, so now I lift (am a skinny girl, no excuses) to build up the muscle around my joints and run a lot less.  Working out was really helpful for a lot of chemical and psychological reasons, like: my brain likes the dopamine, and: making one decision (I will work out) on the premise that *your health is worth prioritizing because your life is valuable* makes it easier to make other decisions (I will not smoke cigarettes) on that same premise.  They reinforce each other.

—For the first week, I bought myself a bunch of stupid shit I wouldn't have otherwise. Same thing with running—buying stuff helped because it was *additive.* It made the process of quitting feel less like losing—losing cigarettes, losing ritual, losing comfort, taking shit away from myself. Running and buying shit were things I added.  Feel me? 


24 days in, here's what stuck and what didn't: I still chew toothpicks, but way less.  I don't check out whyquit anymore, but I hang out here in the back. I buy less dumb shit—it doesn't feel like I'm filling a gap anymore. I work out more, cuz it's easier with clear lungs and is easy to fall into a pattern with. 

Good luck everybody! I'm so prouda you.

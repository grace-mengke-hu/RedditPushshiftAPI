Positive short term effects?

Whenever I try to stop smoking, I do because I lose sight of why I wanted to quit in the first place. 

To stay motivated, what are some short term benefits you noticed within a few weeks? 

One thing I really hope to achieve is better sleep quality and not looking like a corpse every day. Not sure if thats just from smoking though.

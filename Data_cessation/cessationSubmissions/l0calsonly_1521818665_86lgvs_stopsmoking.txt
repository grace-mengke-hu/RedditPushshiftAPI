Today marks my ONE YEAR without cigarettes!!! It's bittersweet.

Hi all, just wanted to announce that today marks ONE YEAR CIGARETTE-FREE and I couldn’t be happier to have the ability to say that! I had my last cigarette on March 23rd of 2017, after ~6 years smoking. Without a doubt, the best decision I’ve ever made!


With that said, this achievement is bittersweet, as my beloved mother isn’t here to witness this milestone in my life. She was a smoker herself, and it was a disease associated with cigarette smoking that ultimately took her from us.


She passed 4 months ago, at the age of 57, and now her passing serves as a cautionary tale… We have to remember that deaths such as these are preventable. My mother smoked for over 40 years and wished she hadn’t ever started. She showed interest in quitting once I had, but unfortunately, it was too late for her.


There are no words to express how much we loved her, and how deeply she is missed. I will honor my moms wishes, as well as my own, and will never smoke again. RIP Mom, not a minute goes by without you crossing my mind. &lt;3

Well starting 7th day

Cravings have gotten much easier, staying busy around the house wife loves it cleaning house and yard like crazy did things I have been putting off also. Energy level is definitely way up, breathing is 100%  better. No more yellow fingers, stained teeth even went and had them whitened this past week.  Love it. I was even around smokers today did not even bother me, I just leave the room if it does.

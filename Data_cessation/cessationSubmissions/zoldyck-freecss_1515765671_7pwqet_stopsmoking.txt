Day One Again

I'm guessing there are plenty of posts that have this title. To look on the positive side though, I lasted a week - which is the longest I've ever lasted. It's difficult to quit when you live in a house that's full of tobacco; everywhere you look, there's the available temptation of a smoke. 

Stay strong people. I succumbed today, but I'm giving it another go. Failure doesn't mean giving up. I'll probably be more active in this sub because that really helped last time. Any general tips would be much appreciated, even though this sub is full of them. 

All the best.

What was like when you realized you were about to quit?

Hi, 
 I'm 33, I smoked one pack a day for the last 14/16 years. I tried to quit half a dozen times and like most of the people I think about quitting almost every day, but I keep failing. 
 I tried with nicotine replacement therapy (patches, inhalers, gums), I have read the Allen Carr book and it kinda worked for a couple of weeks, but I'm still smoking...

  I've struggled with alcohol in the past and tried to get rid of it of that too. The alcohol abuse stopped one day when I had a sort of "revelation": I was tired of drinking. The day before I was an alcoholic, then I just couldn't drink anymore. No withdrawals, no struggle. It's like my mind cleared itself, like a decision was in the making without me even noticing and one day that decision just surfaced and it was all so easy. "this is poison, I'm not drinking that". Just like that.

  I'm kinda waiting for something like that to happen with my smoking problem but it's not happening. The withdrawal symptoms of tobacco are just too strong and kick in so fast. 

  We all know the damages of tobacco but that doesn't keeps us from smoking... until it does. 
 back again to my alcohol abuse, I knew the damage I was doing to my body but couldn't care less. Until one day I just "felt" it. If only I could grasp that moment... it's like waking up fully aware. It was like a miniature panic attack, maybe one second long, maybe less than that. Less than a second of total self awareness when you know exactly what to do. 

  The thing is that even if I experienced it for my alcohol abuse, the same thing won't "click" for my nicotine addiction. 

 What was like for you? Did you experienced a similar moment of clarity? A moment when YOU KNEW without any doubt that you were an ex smoker. 
 Not the beginning of an attempt, but the surfacing of the  consciousness of leaving your past behind you.

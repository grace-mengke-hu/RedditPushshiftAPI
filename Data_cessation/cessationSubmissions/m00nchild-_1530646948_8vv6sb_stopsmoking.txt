So unbelievably pissed off at myself

I smoked. I had two tokes of a cigarette, I didn't even finish it.

I'm supposed to be 3 weeks smoke free tomorrow. I basically am, it was just those stupid tokes.

I was out on Friday night for my 21st. Me and my friend met a couple of guys out. One pulled out a pack of straights and my friend drunkenly took one and put it in my hand. The guy lit it and I toked it twice before freaking out and chucking it on the floor. I forgot. I fucking forgot.

I didn't reset my quit date. Now my time "smoke free" isn't true. One glitch but I feel like I have to reset it. 

If I'd have wanted to smoke I'd have actually smoked it. My drunk brain was just on auto pilot.

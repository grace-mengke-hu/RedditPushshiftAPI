Please write your best methods of dealing with triggers

This is going to sound silly but I have been doing great... handling cravings no problem. Today I hit my head on a lamp hanging from the ceiling (don't ask) - next thing I know, going at it with the girlfriend, giant ball of stress, immediately think "God I want a cig." 

What are your favorite methods of dealing with whatever life throws at you (flat tire, stress at work, whatever)?

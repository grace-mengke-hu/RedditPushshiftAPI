Long time Reader, just a few questions!!

So I, like most people have tried to quit a million times, did anyone here have a pain in their throat like not a really bad pain but like a sharp or soreness pain?(i know you're not doctors lol but some people im sure have had pain this unusual pain is the main reason for my want to quit ), and did any of you try the vapor pens to quit or did you just do cold turkey?

Second time quitting - how long til....

First post! Anyway, I smoked from the age of 15 until I was 20. I restarted at 21. I am now 23 and have quit again. I've always wanted to start running but with smoker's lungs and asthma, it was always feebly attempted. How long does it take on average for the lungs to become healthy again? I also seem to be dealing with this persistent cough and a runny nose. Is this typical?

Jordan Peterson helped Me to stop smoking cigarettes!

Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience with applying some of Jordan Peterson's advice on responsibility to help me quit smoking, let me know if you can relate to my experience. I found that changing the way I was looking at quitting from "i have to quit because it's bad for me" to "it is a responsibility to myself" really helped Me actually want to quit, instead of forcing myself because i 'should'.

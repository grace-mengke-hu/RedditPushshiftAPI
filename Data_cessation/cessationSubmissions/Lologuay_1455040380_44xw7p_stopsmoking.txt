What I Learned relapsing

Hi All,

So  a little background. I have been smoking for 25 years and have been about 60 days clean now.

Since I can remember I have seriously tried to quit smoking since I was 30. (I am 43 now). I have achieved short live success in the past with maybe 10 months of no smoking once and maybe another time i quit for 2 months.

Some things I learned along the way:

1. If you relapse it will be a lot harder to try to quit again.
2. If you relapse years will go by before you give it another serious try.
3. If you relapse after being at least 45 days clean, you wont get the "ahhh" feeling of relief when you puff the first time. That relief only comes when you are addicted to cigarettes, so you will have to **actively try to get addicted** again so you can feel the "aahhh" moment. 
4. As time passes it will be harder and harder to take the decision to quit. Quitting is easy, but taking the final decision to quit is difficult.

5. When you surrender to cigarettes is when you finally understand and accept that you have the freedom to smoke if you choose to, but understand that it wont work anymore. There is no safe way to smoke.

6. Aids such as nicotine gum, Vaping, patches etc only prolong the suffering and the time it takes to clean your body.

There is some great news about quitting the smokes for anyone contemplating it:

1. The struggle will end. It will come a time where smoking is not an issue anymore, nor will you have to fight the nicotine demons for ever. You will gain peace from nicotine a few months after quitting.

2. Quitting is actually easy. Its final deciding that you had enough and take action that its difficult.

Thanks for reading.

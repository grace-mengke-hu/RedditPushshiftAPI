I think I am ready to share publicly that I am a non-smoker

It has been 35 days of no smoking, and I feel ready to share with the world. By which I mean post on facebook.

I just don't feel the need to do it.

A friend who quit with me posts about it online for like whoring and says it makes him feel good and puts the much needed "social obligation" to not relapse.

What does the community feel about it?

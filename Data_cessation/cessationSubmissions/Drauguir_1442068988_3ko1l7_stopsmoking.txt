Tonight is my first night out since I quit (suggestions, please?)

So tonight is my first night out since I quit. I'll be with some good friends and there will be a lot of drinking and even weed. We plan to get fairly drunk, but the thing that scares me the most is that they also plan to bring weed. Should I avoid weed? They'll smoke it without nicotine/tobacco, but I don't like the idea of smoking anything at all. I don't usually smoke it, btw.

I'm also scared about getting drunk and not being able to control the urges of smoking. 

Some suggestions?

I hope I can help

I’m really hoping I’m reaching out to at least one person on here desperate for a motivator to go another day or maybe another hour of quitting. I want to tell you that you can do this, no seriously, you can do this. Whatever your motivation for quitting, whether it’s for your family or your health or your future, use that to drive you to quit. This is not an easy process to go through but know that YOU are stronger than that cigarette, YOU are more important than that cigarette. One day will turn into 2 into 3 into a month a year 5 years. You will get there, one day at a time.

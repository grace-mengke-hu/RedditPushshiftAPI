What's the view on occasional smoking ?

So i smoke only when i drink which at best is a couple of times a week. I do that because i  like the taste to be honest. I don't smoke everyday neither do i have insatiable pangs that force me to open the pack and puff away. When i drink it's probably a half of whiskey and 10 cigarettes and it's mostly once or at most twice a week. Is this bad ? Today being friday i feel like opening a cold one but then i look at the flair of mine that says 5 days and i am feeling guilty..

I need advice on how to approach my dad about quitting smoking

Hello all, I just found this sub and I thought it would be a good place to come for advice. My dad’s 50, and he’s been smoking his whole life. He tried quitting with various medications and stuff before, but it never worked. It’s become one of those things in my family that we all know about, but no one’s willing to talk about. He just doesn’t seem to care anymore, and I know if he doesn’t do something about it something bad will happen. If something happens to him, I won’t be able to go to college, my mom would be just a mess and most importantly, I’d lose my dad and I just, I try not to think about it but I think it’s high time I do. 

I don’t know how to approach him about it, I don’t want to seem angry even though I am and I don’t want to be patronizing or make him feel guilty, but I feel like someone has to give him a slap in the face to make him realize how bad it’s gotten. How would you want someone to approach you about a smoking problem? I’m willing to do anything to help him, I just need to convince him to do something. Thank you for your time.

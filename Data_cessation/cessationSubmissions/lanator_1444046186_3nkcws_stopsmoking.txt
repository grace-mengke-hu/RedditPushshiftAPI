Yes, I want a cigaret sometimes

... Especially if I have been drinking. And of course craving what you can't have sucks - But most of the time I walk around feeling so freaking happy and proud that I'm doing this and that I actually can. The few minutes of frustration once in a while is MINIMUM compared to all the postive emotions that goes along with quitting cigarettes.  I feel a difference in taste, smell, breathing, energy, sleep and hangovers. I feel so freaking GREAT. Do it. NOW.
I recommend reading Allen Carrs book, even though it didn't get me to quit 8 months ago when I read it, I don't believe I would have quit today if I didn't know what he already taught me.
  
Do it!!

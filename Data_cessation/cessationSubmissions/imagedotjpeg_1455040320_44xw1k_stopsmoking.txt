Why shouldn't I get a pack.

Been over a year as of 3 weeks ago, new reddit account so no date. I feel that I can buy a pack and have no problem with a relapse. Talk me down. I can't remember what withdrawl feels like, and I know deep down I shouldn't, but I feel I can handle it. Why shouldn't I? 

Edit- had 2 american spirits (my brain said at least there healthier) and ripped up the pack because I felt so guilty. I knew that if I got a pack of reds (live in marlboro country) then I wouldnt be able to throw out the pack. I slipped but I think im good. You guys helped me feel like shit about smoking those 2 (good thing) and I felt to ashamed to reply to you guys directly. Thank you guys, honestly I needed someone to tell me how stupid I was being. Im an idiot for slipping but I feel with my current situation ( not living/ working with smokers currently) it wont lead to anything.

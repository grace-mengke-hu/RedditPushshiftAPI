Convincing my mom to quit

I'm 29 years old and only found out last year that my mom has been smoking for most of my life.  I knew she smoked when I was very young (I have an old memory of her buying a pack of smokes out of a machine), but as far as I knew she quit when she was pregnant with my sister (25 years ago).  

It's very frustrating because she lost her dad to cancer 20 years ago, when she was only a little older than I am, and that was at least partially caused by his smoking habit.  Is there anything I can say or do to help her?  Have any of you had your kids (whether they be young or adults) say anything that helped?

4 weeks in- crippling anxiety

I posted this in another subreddit but it got looked over, so I'm trying this one- I quit smoking four weeks ago yesterday after fifteen years of doing it. I work as a cook, which is a pretty smoke heavy environment, but managed to get through the first month.

It was a struggle, but I made it through, but since the third week, I've actually been getting hit with crippling anxiety and a newfound insecurity.

I'm not generally an insecure person, and my girlfriend is pretty new in my life (I quit shortly after we started dating), and now I'm dealing with all of these feelings and I'm worried it's going to push her away.

Has anybody here ever suffered this weird anxiety/insecurity thing after they quit smoking? Any advice?

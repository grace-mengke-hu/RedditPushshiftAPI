Not smoking is awesome

Hi lovely people,

I have been lurking here for quite some time. I quit smoking cold turkey 57 days ago and come here everyday to feel extra happy with my decision and to appreciate how far I have come. All of you are an inspiration to me. I have quit many times, but this time I just knew it would be easy, and it was because it felt so good to be free.

Everyday, I experience so many benefits. Let me name a few, so that it might inspire someone.

-	I was hiding it from almost everyone. I felt so ashamed and was always anxious whether someone would smell me. I smell delicious now. My hair, my skin, my breath. I no longer feel self conscious.
-	My skin looks great! My God, I have not had such pretty skin in years. I have my color back and I no longer have acne (knock on wood).
-	I have also stopped drinking because I knew from the past that alcohol would trigger me. So I have not have a drink in 57 as well (which for me is a huge bonus).
-	I am no longer scratching my throat every freaking minute.
-	I have been experiencing "child like" feelings of happiness. I feel so warm en relaxed knowing that I am taking care of myself. Enjoying some tea on the couch with a good book, makes me fuzzy on the inside haha.
-	Obviously I am not wasting my money.
-	The only thing that could relax me after a stressful day at work or wherever was a cigarette. Now I face my issues with a clean mind which feels so much better.
-	I am no longer afraid for my future. I am still young and I was afraid I would die of smoking-related diseases due to my inability to stop smoking. Moreover, it made me a massive hypochondriac. 
-	I am not lazy anymore. Everytime before I would do anything I would think "ah, first a cigarette, then I'll start". I turned me into a major procrastinator.

Well, now that I am writing this I feel like I could go on. Please share your experiences too. It has been such a great motivation booster for me and I am sure for many of us. It reminds us of what a great accomplishment we have achieved.

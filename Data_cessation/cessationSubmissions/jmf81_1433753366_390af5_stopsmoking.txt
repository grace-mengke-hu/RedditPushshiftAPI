Wooohoooo 2 weeks free and a shiny new badge :-)

Honestly them 2 weeks flew by and apart from a few tricky situations it wasn't that bad. I watched Alan Carr's easy way video on YouTube last night I think it has helped massively this morning. Plan to read Freedom from Nicotine in the next few days too.

Quit with Wellbutrin

I was a smoker for 10 years. I tried Chantix a few years ago. I tried Nicorette, which gave me horrible hiccups. I tried an e-cigarette, it was just a substitute until I could smoke a real one. 

2 weeks ago I was put on Wellbutrin for depression. A week into it, I discovered that I just didn't want a cigarette. I just held onto that feeling. When I thought of smoking, I made the conscious decision not to have one. Then I read about COPD. My doctor said that is the most agonizing way to die, not at all peaceful. I don't want my teeth to turn black and fall out and I don't want to have an inhaler.

I have emotional and physical triggers. The worst one is the second I fasten my seatbelt in the car. I remind myself that I do not want COPD. I am training myself to think "COPD" every time I think the word "smoke."

I love that at the end of the day my hair smells like shampoo. It's only been a week, but I am done. I know I will never smoke again. I never wanted to quit, really wanted to, before. Now I go on daily walks and do yoga. I couldn't do that before. Good luck.

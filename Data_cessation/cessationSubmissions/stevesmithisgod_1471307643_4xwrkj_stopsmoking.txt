Any cessation tips?

I decided join Reddit today after (literally) years without an account. I've been a smoker for around 10 years but recently have been properly trying to stop once and for good!

I was wondering if anyone had any cool cessation tips?

Something I've found works pretty well is going for a walk around the block, but while I'm at work that's not really feasible... I've tried drinking water, chewing gum, drawing pictures etc. but all that's really done is made me associate those things with the stress of not having a ciggie...

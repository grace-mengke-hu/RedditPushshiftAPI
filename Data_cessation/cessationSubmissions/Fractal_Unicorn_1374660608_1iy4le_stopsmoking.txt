Deciding to quit, could use some advice.

Haven't slept yet, and the last half an hour or so I thought hard on it. Worked up the courage to go outside, smoke one last more, and then proceeded to tear up the half a pack I had left.

I truly, do not want to cave, and any advice on other things I could do to help me get through the first few weeks would be greatly appreciated.

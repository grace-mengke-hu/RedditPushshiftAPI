Why do I regret quitting so much?

Why do I regret quitting so much? It's been only 4.5 months and I used to be a pack a day smoker for about 11 years. It's just so hard adjusting to things. I've done it for the past 4.5 months, but this month has been just really hard. I cannot stop constantly thinking about it and I just don't want to relapse but I fear I may. This isn't my first time quitting, I've done it in the past and have relapsed and said I'll quit another day. 
I envy those who smoke. I watch my coworkers step outside for cigarette breaks. I think about having a cigarette during my morning coffee. I think about it while driving. 
I smell cigarettes off someone, I don't get disgusted, I want to smell it more. Kinda weird how it all works. I think about all the times that I would go smoke and take a break from work. Think about smoking during long phone calls and how it would calm me down. 
This is just a rant using a throwaway username. I'm 4.5 months in and not sure if I want to continue being an ex-smoker. 

Thanks

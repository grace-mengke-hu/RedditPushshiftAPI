Had kidney stone, stopped smoking!

Hi!

I have lurked here for a while and have been trying to prepare myself to quit smoking at some point. I smoked on average a pack a day for the last 13 years or so. I did stop smoking for about a year about 7 years ago, but I started again when I was back in school.

I recently went through an experience with a kidney stone stuck in my right ureter tube for a week. I can say it was one of the roughest and most brutal experiences I've ever had. All of my energy was focused on managing the excrutiating pain, relentless nausea, and intense vomiting. There wasn't much energy left for nicotine cravings. 

The third day in I smoked the last two cigarettes I had. I was low on cigarettes when the kidney stone happened, thankfully. After that I didn't want any at all. When the kidney stone passed after a week I just said "I already have several days without smoking, let's quit now." 

Today starts my second week smoke-free. Yay! It's going well so far with most urges coming from triggers. I really hope I can quit for good. My life is an awful mess, and I could really use the confidence being a non-smoker could give me.

Has anyone else successfully quit smoking by taking advantage of a time you were sick or injured and couldn't smoke?

tl;dr I didn't smoke for almost a week while I had a kidney stone. I took that as an opportunity to quit for good.

2!

I hit the two year mark last week, it feels great.

All of my friends who smoked, still smoke but two whole years has gone by and i haven't even touched a cigarette. 

New quitters, you can do it. It is important to always understand that your will power is a machine gun that will pierce through all your cravings if you aim it just the right way.

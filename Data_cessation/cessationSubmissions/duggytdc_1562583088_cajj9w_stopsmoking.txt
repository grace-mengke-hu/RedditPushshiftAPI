This time I mean it!!!!

I've tried quitting twice before and unfortunately never got passed the three week hurdle. I'm seriously determined this time. I need to do this for my health. I had my last cigarette yesterday evening and I have to admit, this morning has been a challenge. I'm just looking forward to a smoke free future.

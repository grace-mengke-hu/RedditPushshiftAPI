I feel like I cheated.

One full day smoke free. Yesterday was good... though I did go to bed super early to fend off the headache. This morning though the cravings were awful. Waited it out for about 2 hrs and finally caved and chewed a piece of nicotine gum. It helped tremendously, but now I feel guilty. I know this is keeping me addicted. But is it possible the gum with help me deal with the mental addictions first and then the physical addictions will be something I can manage a little easier once I have the mental beat? Looking for advice and guidance from those who have been here before me, please and thank you!

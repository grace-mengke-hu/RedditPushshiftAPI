My Story of Quit

I had smoked off and on, mostly on, from the ages of 13 to 30.  I quit sometimes in my 30th year, shortly after getting married.  Save for the occasional cigar on vacation, I was smoke free.

Turning 41 I found myself starting the arduous process of getting divorced, moving to a new state and starting a new job.  So, for some reason,  it seemed like a good idea to start smoking again.

The new job didn't work out(laid off twice).  So, third times a charm, moved again for work and landed a good gig.  Now to tackle the smoking.

I kept being on the verge of quitting and never did.  My GF/SO was after me to quit(much to her credit, not in a nagging way).  I kept going a couple of days without smokes and then stopping either on the way to or from work to buy a pack.

One night, the Friday before Christmas 2013, I tossed my last butt from the pack and pulled into the driveway, figuring I would go get some more int he morning when I was running errands.

I woke up the next day and discovered I really didn't have a reason to leave the house other than to procure smokes.  I decided that if that was the only reason to leave the house, I didn't need to leave.  

 Every other time I had tried to quit, I would make some plan.  Try to make some substitution for the cigarettes.  This time, I just said fuck it.  

Tomorrow will be 1 month with no smokes.

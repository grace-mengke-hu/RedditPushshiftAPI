Smoked my last yesterday. Need advice.

Hello there!

I am 23 years old, and I have been smoking daily for 6 years. I would say that on average, I smoked about 5 cigarettes per day. I was out with a girl yesterday, and as soon as she found out that I am a smoker, she left our date. So that's one reason for me to stop. But I want to say that mainly, I am doing this for myself.

So here's the question: How hard is it going to be for me? Which day will be the worst? How long until the addiction is gone?

I appreciate your advice.

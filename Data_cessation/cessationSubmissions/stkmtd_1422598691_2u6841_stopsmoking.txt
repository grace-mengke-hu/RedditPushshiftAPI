3! 3! 3! :D

This has been by far the easiest quit I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, it's been challenging, but I just keep remembering the magic words:

"please join me in not smoking today"

You can say it to others, and you can say it to your lizard brain.

Special thanks to all the folks on this sub. I don't have as much time as I'd like to join all the conversations, but hearing your success stories, and seeing that we all struggle with (but overcome) this has been huge.

2015 is great year to stick it to Big Tobacco.

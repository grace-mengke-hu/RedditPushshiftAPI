Day 13

44, F. Smoked for the past 5 years after quitting for 7. Before that smoked for 17 yrs. Quit cold turkey. 
Oddly, this time round I do not look at other smokers with envy. I don’t see quitting as losing something. I see it as freedom. Freedom from an addiction that made me feel guilty, embarrassed and sick. 
I’ve had a chronic sinus infection for over a year. There has been liquid behind my left eardrum for that long - a problem that would only clear if I quit smoking. I didn’t. 
Yesterday, for the first time in a year, the liquid drained and my ear popped. I can hear again! What a gift. 
So yeah, I’m done for good.

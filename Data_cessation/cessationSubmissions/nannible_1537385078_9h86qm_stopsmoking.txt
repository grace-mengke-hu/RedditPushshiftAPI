Anxiety

Day 7 of my quit today. I'm feeling overall pretty great and confident.

Though I've noticed some underlaying anxiety. It's not so much that I'm anxious because I want to smoke, it's more like I get anxiety and before I would smoke, so now I'm left kinda just knowing I would normally smoke in this situation. Not that I actually want a smoke, just that it's what I'd normally do. And that leads to more anxiety because now I'm not only anxious about whatever is bothering me but also I'm thinking about smoking. 

It's kinda a chicken and the egg situation. I'm unsure if it's just that I'm an anxious person and I used to smoke whenever I was anxious to calm myself. Has quitting just unveiled the anxiety that was always there?

Or is the anxiety just a symptom of quitting?  Was I just always anxious because I was always withdrawing from nicotine and lighting up relieved that?

I'm sure everyones different but thought I'd ask here. Anyone dealing with anxiety after your quit? Were you an anxious smoker? Were you an anxious person before you started smoking? Are you an anxious person still long after quitting?

Thanks!

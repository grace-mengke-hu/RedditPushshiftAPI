6 weeks today!

Longest I have ever gone. Switched to the stage 2 Nicoderm patch today. 4 weeks and then I'll be cigarette & nicotine free. Looking forward to that day. Have saved $475 and not smoked 1,715 cigarettes in this amount of time. Hasn't been easy, but has been worth it. Fixing the 22 yrs of damage.

Weight gain since I quit..

Sorry if this is wrong place to post this. I thought others could help me. I quit smoking right before my 21st bday and gained weight. Started again for a while. Quit again last November and its been great! I haven't felt this good in so long. I'll be turning 23 in a month and problem is.. I've gained weight again. Ive just started working out and eating better portions so maybe it will get better; always meant to as it is phase two of operation: get healthy. I guess I'm looking for other experiences and tips to help me get/stay slim and healthy.

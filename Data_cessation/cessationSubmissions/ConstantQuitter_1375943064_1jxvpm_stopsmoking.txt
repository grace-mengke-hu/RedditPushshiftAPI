Is This Really It?

Im 21 years old. I've been smoking since 18. Should be easy to kick it right? I quit literally every night... I've thrown out packs i have just to root through garbage to get them a half hour later, I've had that last ceremonial ciggarette as i broke the rest of my ciggarettes citing a reason for each one to quit for each one i broke. It's sad really. All that being said i did manage to go four months last year and broke down on a drunk night. I know this quitting every night deal is taking a toll on me. Im tired of this black cloud hanging over me and i want to be free and get on with my life. So this is it, I'm giving it a go once again.(just "quit" about an hour ago). Im going to post this.. and smoke my last ciggarette ever. What are your guys thought on this? is anyone in the same boat?(quitting every night)

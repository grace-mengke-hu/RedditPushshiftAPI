Almost 2 weeks and made it past a major hurdle: drinking.

Obviously I couldn't avoid eating to dodge the after meal cravings.  I skipped coffee for a bit but got back into that with out giving in.  Tonight I had some recreational drinks with friends.   

I knew that was going to be a hard one to overcome.  The urge was definitely there but it helped I wasn't around people that smoked anyway.   

I did pop some nicotine gum (which i've been getting off of as well) to shut my brain up and I'm good.

Looking forward to doubling down my progress to a full month and beyond.

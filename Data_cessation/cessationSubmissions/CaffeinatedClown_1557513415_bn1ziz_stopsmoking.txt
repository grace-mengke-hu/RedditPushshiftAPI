Question about a cough (10 months in)

Hello!

It has been 10 months and 4 days since I quit smoking (yay!). I smoked a pack/ pack and a half for almost 17 years (started when I was 12). About 5 months after I quit, December, I’ve had a terrible cough. After two months of it I was sent to a pulmonologist. My lungs are 100% clear, no wheezing or rattling. He diagnosed me with adult onset asthma but I didn’t respond to medications. I kept getting pleurisy due to harsh cough. Over time i have begun taking acid meds Incase that was irritating it and allergy medication just in case (have been tested for allergies and have none) I had like a post-nasal thing going.
The cough has slowly gotten better but is still not gone. It is worse at night and when I wake up. It does get worse with irritants, such as smells, smoke, too hot or too cold, etc. it still does not respond to asthma medications.
Is it possible this is a result of quitting? Have any of you developed issues similar? If so, what seemed to help?
TIA!

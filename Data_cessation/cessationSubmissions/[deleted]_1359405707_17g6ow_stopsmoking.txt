One tiny victory

8 weeks in. It hasn't been too difficult up until today. But God, today. The entire day felt like one long craving, it was unbearable. I was so close to breaking and buying a pack on the way home from work. But I didn't. 

Not this time, you fucking cigarettes. I'm tired of your shit.

Help! I have the biggest urges to smoke when I have a break from studying or working! What things do you do instead of smoking when you have breaks?

It is so hard at work when everyone is smoking in the breaks. I tried so often but in these situations I always relapse.. :/

Or when I am alone at home I have to make a break after some time when I am studying.. but I just don't know what to do instead of smoking.. W
hat do you do in breaks?

How fast can you run now? How deep can you breathe?

I smoked 16 years, around a pack a day or so. I always ran about 3 miles a day for the 2 years and after I quit, I don't really notice that much of a difference in my speed or endurance.

It's sad, but I miss chain smoking 3 cigarettes before and after my runs. How dumb is that? 

Am I giving myself bad data to justify wanting to go back to smoking? Or am I just not trying hard enough?

I guess these are questions I have to ask myself. 

What are you experiences with exercise and endurance post-nicotine-escape?

I don't like calling it quitting ;).

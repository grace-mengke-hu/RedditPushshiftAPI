Smoke free for 2 days!

I’ve been using Nicorette gum (4mg) to quit smoking, (I’ve never used it before and was very sceptical about it) and I’ve been smoke free for two days so far!! I’m really happy with myself as I usually have a pack a day for nearly 2 years straight (started when I was 16) .. I’ve only had short moments where I got pissed off but haven’t craved a ciggie. I have a VooPoo Rex vape that I puff on throughout the day but haven’t even thought of having a cig! :)))

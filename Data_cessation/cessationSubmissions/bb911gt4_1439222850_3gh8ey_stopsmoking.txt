Things to help on your first quit day.

Hey guys, I've quit smoking a few times.  Sometimes weeks, months, one time for over a year. 
Anyways,
I find it best to have a full day of activities planned on your first day.  The last time I quit (8 days ago), I planned an all day mountain bike trip. Woke up early, and did a 40 mile bike ride to a state park.  It's hard to get a pack of cigs in the middle of the woods and you definitely won't find someone to bum one off of on the bike trail.  Plus all the sweating makes you feel like you're really cleansing your body.   And the best part is that you're exhausted and can pass out early when you get home. It's pretty much a guaranteed way not to relapse on your first day.  

How about you guys?  What do you do on your first day?

Best way to get my teenage (18 yr old) brother in law to quit smoking while he is still young?

My brother in law is 18 and has been smoking since he was 17 and is currently living with us. We stressed the importance of not smoking and doing hookah is not good for him and we got him to use patches and e-cigarettes and he even stopped for a week or two. As soon as we got off his case and he hangs out with friends he does it again. If he isn't working he sleeps 15 hour days. I feel like this is a side effect of the smoking, but I am no DR.  We are to the point where we think its a lost cause and this is something he needs to understand and learn the hard way. Does everyone else agree? Have any advice? 

He pays rent and doesn't cause any damage to the house, nor smoke in the house, does what we tell him to for chores and pay's us some rent to cover utilities and food, so he isn't a horrible kid. I am just concerned about his future and well being. 

edit: Thanks for all the good feedback!

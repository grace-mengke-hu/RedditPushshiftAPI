Day 1, the cravings never stop

I'm about 12 hours in and I can't stop thinking about lighting up a cigarette. I was lead to believe the cravings came in periods and only lasted around 5-10 mins, but I've been thinking non-stop and it feels like a part of myself has died in a sense.

How did you guys fight off the urge the first week? (and even afterwards)

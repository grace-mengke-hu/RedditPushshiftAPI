ug, 3 years down the drain

I broke a 3 year abstinence yesterday. I've been so stressed out, the cravings have been so intense ... and I gave in and bought a pack smoked several before getting disgusted with myself. Time to get back on the horse and try to quit again. Any advice on staying away from them?

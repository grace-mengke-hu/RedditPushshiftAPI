Hey Everybody. Emotions Strategy Question.

32/M, been smoking for about half of my life on and off. 5 days in and doing so good. Except 1 thing. I have been noticing that I have been extremely emotionally unstable and it has been affecting my relationship with my gf. She knows what is going on, but is getting frustrated with how short my fuse is right now. 

Does anyone have any strategies for keeping calm and focused while detoxing? 

Thanks in advance!

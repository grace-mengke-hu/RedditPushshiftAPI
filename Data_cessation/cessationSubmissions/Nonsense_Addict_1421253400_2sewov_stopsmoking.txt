Quitting for good. . . Again.

Like every smoker, I have quit smoking many times. The last time quit, I was nicotine-free for 3 months! 

I started smoking again, and was given an e-cig for my birthday a month ago. I've been switching between vaping and smoking cigarettes, but now I'm ready to quit both.

I've done it before, and I can do it again! I miss smelling nice!

Forty days in and my sleeping schedule is miserable. Thoughts? Similar issues?

What's good, my people?! I hope everyone is trucking along on their path of quitting! Before I describe my issues with sleeping, some quick facts about me and my quit:

- Forty days in
- Stage 2 of the patch (14 mg)
- Full time uni student (math/comp sci)
- Very healthy lifestyle (regular exercise, diet is on point, rarely drink)
- Caffeine addict (two cups of coffee per day, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon)

So as the title says, my sleeping schedule is just beyond messed up right now. I'm not falling asleep before 1:00 A.M. no matter how hard I try, which is really lame because before quitting, I took pride in my ability to wake up early. Now, it's a constant struggle to fall asleep and get adequate rest before a long 8-12 hour day of lectures, labs, tutoring, etc etc.

It is really taking a toll on my well being. 

Has anyone one else faced similar issues? I am sure it is related to my quit, seeing as my body is still adjusting to the change, but I can't help but feel like I could be taking measures to get my sleeping schedule back on track.

Any and all advice/tips/telling of experiences is appreciated, and again, keep it up!

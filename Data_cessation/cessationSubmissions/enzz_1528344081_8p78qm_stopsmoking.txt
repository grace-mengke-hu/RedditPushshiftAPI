Is it normal to continuously cough after quitting?

I quit smoking 26 days ago. I’m so proud of myself, especially since I smoked a pack a day and everyone I live with smokes. 

However, I am starting to cough a lot and my lungs feel very...sensitive? The coughing started happening shortly after quitting. 

I don’t have a cold or anything as I have gotten sick for about a week and feel all better now... but I can’t help but cough a lot. 

Just wondering if this is happening to anyone else after they quit?

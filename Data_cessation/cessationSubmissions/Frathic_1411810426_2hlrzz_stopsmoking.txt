Finally done with smokes. It took a sinus and lung infection in Cambodia to do it.

On some wicked antibiotics and taking a bus to Thailand tomorrow in case i need a hospital. (i doubt i will) But it's going to be easier this time because i quit drinking the same day. Stay strong brothers and sisters.

Over two years now.

I prefer not to think about smoking now as its just mildly unsettling. I had a few bouts where I thought I could pick up again here and there. Primarily after picking up a drink again after a year of sobriety, but I switch to a vape after my slip and went cold turkey. 

I just want to say that it can be done, and it can be forever. Good luck and stay positive /r/stopsmoking.

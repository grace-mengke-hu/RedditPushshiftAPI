Smoke Free App - Badges

Question about the Smokefree app badges......i've been off the smokes 9 days (YAY!!), which is 211 hours smoke free & 176 cigarettes not smoked, & I got a badges (chuffed!) for 50 & 100 not smoked, & also a badge for 100 hours smoke free, so here I am, waiting in anticipation for my 150 cigs not smoked & 200 hours smoke free badges, but they've never come through. So, my question is, what is the ratio that ya get badges, & does 150 cigs not smoked & 200 hours not smoked not qualify?  I know I probably sound like a kid waiting for Christmas or summit, but I want my goddamn badges, ha!

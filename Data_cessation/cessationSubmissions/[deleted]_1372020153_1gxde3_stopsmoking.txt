Made it 2 weeks, got through a wedding smoke-free!

Two weeks ago on Saturday night, I smoked what was to be my last cigarette. I was the designated driver at a wedding, and since I couldn't drink, I went out for smoke breaks all night. The next morning I woke up feeling so awful that I decided to quit my ~1 cigarette a day/more on weekends habit. Last night I was at another wedding, and I made it all night without a hitch! I felt a little jealous of the smokers at one point, then remembered that there is absolutely nothing to feel jealous about--I woke up this morning with healthy, happy lungs. (My liver, not so much, heh.) Just had to share, since a wedding is something I would normally chain smoke through. Yay, day 15!

what if instead of resetting the badge, we cut our day count to half everytime we smoke, that way we get punished enough but not so much that we quit caring about smoking again

My point is - instead of 'number of days since last smoke' there should be a better metric reflected for each user. like if someone stayed quit for 3 years and slipped once. his badge should reflect that. instead of just saying when was the last time he smoked.

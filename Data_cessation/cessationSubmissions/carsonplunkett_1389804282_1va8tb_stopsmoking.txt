First day.

Hey guys. Been lurking here for a few weeks while contemplating quitting and finally decided to drop this crap for good. I've been an on and off smoker since I was around 15 and quit for three years when I was 18. I stupidly picked the habit back up around two years ago after smoking a single cigarette at a party. Ended up buying some Black & Mild's which eventually turned into buying a pack of smokes. Slowly but surely I was back at a pack a day. 

It's amazing how awful cigarettes make you feel. I spend at least 5 minutes every morning coughing up junk, spend $5-6 a day when my budget is already tight enough, and I'm constantly tired and lethargic. I've noticed a significant decrease in my sex drive as well. Earlier this week I decided enough is enough and tried to cut back significantly, which never works. I'm going cold turkey. No e-cigs, no patch, no gum. 

It's been about 12 hours since my last smoke and I'm having serious cravings. Not giving in. Wish me luck!

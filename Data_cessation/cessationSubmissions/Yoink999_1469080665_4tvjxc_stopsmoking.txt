Trying.....

Ok so trying to turn my life around and thus means packing in the fags along with a few other things.
Getting off my ass and 1/2 marathon training, learning to surf, to climb, mountain bike. 

Keep smoking my mates fags when I'm up the pub, and usually manage to get by with a vape.

What do you guys think about the vape? Does it just prolong the nicotine addiction? I keep "accidentally" buying a lack of ten to supplement it....

All advice wanted and needed.

Just finished last fag in a packet and hoping I don't buy more.....

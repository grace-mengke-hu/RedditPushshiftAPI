Bollocks to nicotine

I paid $7.19 for a pack of cigs 2 weeks ago. When I started they were $1.76. I said that is the most I will ever spend and I'm done. Its was a pack of marlboro black mentol 100's, so I got my moneys worth. The day after I finished that pack I had a mentol L&M. That was 8/6. I had been using nicotine gum to get through the day at work. I'm giving that up too. Finanical reasons. 

My replacement behavior while home and wanting to smoke is to use my ceramic cig looking one hitter instead of my bowl. So far so good. It gives me that soothing crutch feeling of holding a cig... I had been smoking electronic cigs until they raised the price of them and cigs became cheaper, so the feel of the one hitter is comparable to an eletric cig. 

My flair needs to be reset

110 days in and cravings for days

As the title says, I'm 110 days in and thought I wouldn't be going nuts by now. I want a puff and to feel the smoke on my tongue. I walked into a cigarette store yesterday and when I saw the word tar I was turned off, but I still want to feel that feeling of inhaling. What's up with this sudden onset of strong cravings/ It's been 3 days now.

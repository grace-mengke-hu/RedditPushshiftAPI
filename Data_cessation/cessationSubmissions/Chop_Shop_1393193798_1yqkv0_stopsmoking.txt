Any tips on dealing with brain fog?

I used to be a casual smoker but it started getting bad, so I quit last week. Not a big deal as I never got beyond a couple a day. However, I am experiencing headaches and brain fog- inability to concentrate and the feeling like I'm in a daze. Usually, this wouldn't be a big deal- I'd just power through it. 

However, I have a technical interview coming for a job Friday, and I absolutely need to be 100% for it. How have you guys dealt with that brain fog? For that matter, any tips on those headaches besides apirin? 

TBH, I'm really considering a quick smoke before the interview to get rid of it.

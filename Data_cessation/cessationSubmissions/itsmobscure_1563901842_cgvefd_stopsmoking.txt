Was smoke free for 2 months

2 months ago I decided I did not wanna smoke anymore. It was difficult the first few days but after a week I wasn't that tempted anymore. It was great, quite a rejuvenating feeling to know I made it that far and had no itention of starting again. Everything seemed to be going fine until it hit me recently. No one really cared that I had stopped. I do live at home and so my parents would definetly had noticed that I stop smoking. They would often complain about the smell and talk me out of it. But no response after 2 months. 

It felt quite awful that the people I care about didnt seem to notice that I had quit this awful habit. So since nobody cared I foolishly made the decision to start again. I'm not sure why the fact that people around me didnt care made me start again, but it did. Knowing that nobody cares makes quiting again alot harder. 

I'm not quite sure what to make of it. But I would wanna hear if anyone else has had a similar experience.

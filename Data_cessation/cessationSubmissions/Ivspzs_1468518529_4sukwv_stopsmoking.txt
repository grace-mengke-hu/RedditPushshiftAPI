Need help prep'ing

Just a short background. I've been nicotine free for about 6 months now. I've had ups and downs but I managed to stay free thanks to this sub. Ever since, i had vowed to give back to the community by creating a checklist in my weekly routine to give encouragements to others.

I'm going to an island with my cousin for a 3 day retreat. I've been quite good in going on with the flow, understanding urges and 'wave riding" it  to let urges pass by. But this trip will be a little different from my everyday scenario because we are planning to Roll. My main concern would be that if I don't prep myself properly, I might make a mistake because of it. I've experienced it with alcohol and pass all tests but i must say it was really hard. 

Not going for the trip or not rolling is out of the question because we had planned this trip far far ahead time and I too look forward for this trip. i would like to know if any of you had experienced such event and how did you deal with it?

Currently my plan is to find a strong reason why I've quit and why I'm still smoke-free and recite it every night until the trip is over.

TLDR; OP is going for an island retreat for 3 days and planning to roll. OP is scared for his life that he would make a mistake while rolling balls.

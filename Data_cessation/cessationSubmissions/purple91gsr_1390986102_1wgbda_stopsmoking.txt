Looking for a good app

I've stated on the champix (chantix) tablets and will be stopping smoking in around a week and a half. 
I'm looking for a good android app to keep track of my success requirements are;
*No constant reminders that "im doing great" and such (or the ability to turn them off
*ability to input number of cigarettes smoked, price per packet or cigarette
*constantly updating tally of cigarettes not smoked, money saved, and health benefits 
*synchronisation of some sort so I don't lose my stats if I change phones or something. 
*and a home screen widget to display them would be awesome! 

Does such an app exist? I figured if it does, someone here would know.

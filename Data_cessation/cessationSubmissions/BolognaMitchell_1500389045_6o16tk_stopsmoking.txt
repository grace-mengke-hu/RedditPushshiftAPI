Trying again, feel good about it this time

I quit for about 6 months last year and felt great about it. It was probably the best year of my life. Then I went on a date with a girl who smoked and I bummed one and was smoking again within a week.

I generally don't feel like I'm actually in the process of quitting smoking until several days in. It's been a full week since my last cigarette, and I feel great. I am confident I can actually quit for good this time. 

I am just getting into the "all mental" stage of quitting and my goal is to just never lose sight of the fact that I can never "just have one smoke every once in a while." I am addicted to nicotine. I have resigned myself to the fact that I am past the point where I could become a "casual" smoker again like other people I see around me. If I take even one drag off of a cigarette, there are only two options moving forward: stop smoking again, which would require another 3 days of flushing the nicotine from my body and going through the withdrawals again; or start smoking again. Both of those options sound horrible, and they certainly aren't worth the 5 minutes of buzz I would get from smoking in the first place.

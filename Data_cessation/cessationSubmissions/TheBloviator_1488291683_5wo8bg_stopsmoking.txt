Roommate Woes: Smoking

So back when I smoked, I'd always bum some cigarettes to my roommate. Through me he'd probably smoke about 5-7 cigarettes a week. This number increased when we drank and he would occasionally buy his own packs. 

So, unless he bought his own packs, my quitting essentially meant his quitting. 

When I told him I was quitting, I asked him to take the patio ashtray down to his car (since it was his and self-made) and asked him not to keep lighters in the apartment. Also, I told him to please refrain from smoking at the apartment if at all possible. 

He did everything I asked. Great dude. But now that I'm almost 5 months in, he doesn't care anymore. He claims he is a "casual smoker," that he has "a few a week while on a work break." 

Me being a nice dude, when he asked if he and his friends could smoke on the patio (whilst they were drinking) I said yes--cause I don't want to stop a whole group of people because of my struggle. 

But now the gates are open, and they will likely be "smoking the occasional cig."

This, is in fact, going to be a good test...but a scary one.

P.S. (He totally still thinks he's a non-smoker)

Smoke Free Morning Routine

This is day 6 of my new smoke free life!  Feeling pretty good so far but I still struggle a lot in the morning.   I love my coffee &amp; smoke to wake up &amp; need a new routine to replace it.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what worked for them?  I am using Nicorette to help with the physical withdrawals.  Thanks in advance!

Has anybody had success with a Juul?

I smoked cigarettes for about 5 years and switched to a Juul to try and quit, but have only become more addicted. It helped to lower my daily nicotine for a few weeks, but afterwards I think I have become more addicted. I went from a pack every 3 days to a pod (roughly 1 pack worth of nicotine) a day. 

I'd love some insight on how to lower my nicotine usage since this has been very hard.

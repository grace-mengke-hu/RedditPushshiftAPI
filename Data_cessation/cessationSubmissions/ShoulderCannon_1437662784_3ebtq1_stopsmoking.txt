It's up to me, and I can't do this completely by myself. Help?

Hello /r/stopsmoking.

I've followed the sub for 2 years.

I've had SmokeFree installed on both of my phones for the past 2 years.

I don't like asking for help.  I don't like support.  It makes me fail at stopping smoking.

I'm 31.  I've smoked for more than half my life...  I'm gonna die if I keep this up.

Here I am.

Sorry for the shitpost, but I have to make this real.

Thanks guys.

EDIT:  I wanna thank everyone that took time out of their day to shoot kind words and advice my way.  You're all fantastic.  Deffinitely starting to sweat now, but went for a walk and put up some motivational propaganda around my desk.  Being involved in not trying to actively kill myself twice an hour will no doubt be a challenge, but I got this!

We got this!!

8 days and sometimes counting....

My best friend and I were talking and i realised i had been smoking for nearly 25 years.... 25 years??? How did that happen?? So that was it ...I stopped cold turkey..... omg!!! Who knew it was gonna hurt so much ??first three days I had panic attacks and wanted to eat everything and now I am having good days and bad days ..... yesterday was the first day I did not look for my fags and remember I had given up..... I just did not want one. However today I stayed in because I knew if I walked past a shop I may have popped in and purchased some......

I feel like an alcoholic and keep repeating the mantra 'one day at a time' I also tell everyone I meet.... maybe I am hoping they will clap lol 

Anyway thank you for my three minute ramble and keeping my craving at bay xx

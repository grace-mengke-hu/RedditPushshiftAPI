Quitting... again.

I am quitting again. This will be my fourth time as I've found that I am paying over 800 dollars in cigarettes every 6 months. Also, I bought a pack the other day for almost 7 dollars. 

This sucks so bad. I want to quit, I do, but it's so so hard... I guess I just need support, so, here goes.

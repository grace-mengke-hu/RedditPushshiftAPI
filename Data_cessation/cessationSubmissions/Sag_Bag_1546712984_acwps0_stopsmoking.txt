Week 3 not smoking, day 2 no nicotine. Please tell me it gets better.

I chewed for a year before I discovered smoking. Smoked for 6 months and then discovered vaping. Vaping helped clear out my lungs and I could smell and taste again. I vaped way more than I smoked though, so I decided to go one step further and quit vaping. 

I feel so sick and my mind is foggy. It's not as bad today as it was yesterday, but the cravings are stronger.

How long does this last? Do you think I should keep going cold turkey or should I decrease the amount of nicotine over time?

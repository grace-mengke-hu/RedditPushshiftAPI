Hello, new to sub, looking for quit smoking apps that don't require permissions

About a year and a half ago I had a great and simple app that helped keep track of my smoking habits and it didn't require any permissions but I can't seem to find it again. 

Does anyone here know of a good app to help with this particularly invasive addiction?

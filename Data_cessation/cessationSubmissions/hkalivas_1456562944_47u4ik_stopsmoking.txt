Tobacco free again....13th day

This is my little story. Am 38. Used to smoke from 16 until 24. Started again after 8 years that I had stop (at 32). After a heavy flue I took the decision .... I feel free again. 13 days now without nicotine and the feeling that I ll never do this bad habit again. The only situation am afraid is when I drink alcohol. Good lack everybody

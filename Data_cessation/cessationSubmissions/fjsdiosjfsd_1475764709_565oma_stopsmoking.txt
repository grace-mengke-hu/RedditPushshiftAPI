Taste is coming back a little, and my brain is still trying to trick me

I'm 2-3 days into my second quit and was just thinking about how great my breakfast tasted (two eggs, toast, coffee). I took a particularly good sip of coffee just now and my brain immediately said, "you should have a cigarette to enhance this experience."

I couldn't help but laugh out loud at how ingrained this response is! The second I realized what my brain was doing, my mind said "lol nope."

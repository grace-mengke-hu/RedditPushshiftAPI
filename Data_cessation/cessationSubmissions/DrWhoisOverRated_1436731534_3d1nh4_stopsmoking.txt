Using an e-cig. It feels great to say that I haven't had a cigarette in 12 days, but I feel like I'm cheating.

Title says it all.  I bought an e-cig and have been using it for 12 days after being a pack a day smoker for nearly 10 years.  I know that these things have dangerous side effects of their own, and I'm not claiming to be healthy while using it.  My first goal was to stop wasting so much money, which I've done, (so far) and my goal is to slowly decrease the levels of nicotine until I'm done with it.

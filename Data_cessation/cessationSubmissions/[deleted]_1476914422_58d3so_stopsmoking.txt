One month down!

Been nicotine free for one month now, and had two pretty big cravings today. 
They were not acute and physical like in the early stages but i just really felt like having a cig, and my mind went great lengths to convince me that i can handle just one. I know I cant, and I feel so great without all that trash inside my body. 
Cigarettes are not worth it and most of the time I dont even think about it. 

Hope all of you are doing well!

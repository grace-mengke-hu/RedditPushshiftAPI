My House of Cards is 49 storeys high.

This is one little mind hack I have found that helps me deal with cravings. Quitting smoking is like building a house of cards. Every day you don't smoke is like adding a new level or storey to the house. The day you give in to your cravings is like pulling out one of the cards and letting the whole thing collapse. And then you start from ground zero again.

My House of Cards is now 49 storeys high. Every day I look at the little growing castle I have built, I get filled with a warm feeling of joy and pride. I am too invested now in my House of Cards to let it collapse. One day I am going to look back at the castle, thousands of storeys high, and see it as one of the great achievements of my life.

I know, pedantically, that Houses of Cards get shakier the higher they are. Well this is my imagination, so it gets stronger the bigger it becomes 

Let me know what you feel about this.

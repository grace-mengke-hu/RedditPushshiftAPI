Quit 1 month ago. How long until...

16 year smoker here. How long until I start to gain back my deep breaths? I want to start doing cardio exercises again, but I still can't f-cking breathe. I know it'll take more than 3 months, but how much more? I'm still young-ish if that helps nail down an answer or estimate.

Thanks for any replies!

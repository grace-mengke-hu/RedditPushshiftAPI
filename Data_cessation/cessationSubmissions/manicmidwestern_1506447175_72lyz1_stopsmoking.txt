Stopped smoking for a year but started back up again.

I did so well for about a year.  Night out with friends and started smoking cigars, argument with the so and bought a pack. Stress at work and school bought more. It's like I never quit in the first place now. New quit date of Nov 1st. Hope this goes better this time.

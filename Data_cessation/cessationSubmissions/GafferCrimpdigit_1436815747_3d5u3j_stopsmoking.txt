Confession

I smoked. 140 days in and I caved. I just need to confess so I don't pretend to myself it's nothing. 

I actually smoked 138 days in. I can't lie any more. I don't know why, I thought it would be a reward. 

I was on top of the world and living a new life but I smoked as a reward for my achievement. Then I had some bad news today and I smoked again. 

I'm sorry, I have failed. I won't fail again. I just needed to tell someone. Thanks for listening.

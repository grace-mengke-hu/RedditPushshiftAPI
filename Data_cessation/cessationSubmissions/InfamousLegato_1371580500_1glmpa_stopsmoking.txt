About 26 hours in. Doing pretty well, but I'm feeling tempted to open the E-Cig in my bag.

I feel like I'm doing this right. Completely cold turkey. I stopped yesterday at 12:30 PM. Smoked my last one while the co-workers were at lunch and just.. never bought another pack. Kept turning them down from the roommates and now here I am a full 24 hours later. 

Bupropion is really making this a lot easier. I've also got Tea Tree Chewing Sticks, but I am feeling a little bit of that afternoon fog and would love to use my E-Cig to clear that up. I know that there are people who've quit without either of these luxuries at their disposal. Cessation Nation tells me I'm 36% done with "Nicotine has been removed from your body" and that is exciting as hell. Do I really want to compromise that now?

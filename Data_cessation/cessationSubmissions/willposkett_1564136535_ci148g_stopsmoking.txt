Obvious advice - but it is working for me

Smoked for 17years, almost 20 a day near the end. Tried so many things - vaping (made me ended up smoking more), Alan Carr (helped me quit for 10months but stopped working) and cold turkey/will power (nope).

For all these years i dismissed nicotine gum as a fad/keeping me hooked but it actually works! I have been smoke free for a month now, and this has been the best/ easiest yet. The truth is when you're a smoker there are two things to break (physical cravings and mental association). The gum has made the  later far easier by aiding the former. 

It has also been very easy to taper off the gum, from 5 to none now. Might pop a couple if drinking, but thats it. 

No doubt haters are gonna hate on this, but it is working for me so thought i would share!

Been trying to get a badge for 3 days. Bot didn't work and mods haven't responded. I know it sounds stupid but I really don't feel comfortable quitting without a badge.

Did I do something wrong in the request process? I already technically lost my badge twice in the past 3 days but it would really help for me to have some visual process and feel like I'm part of the community, because I've been alone in my addictions since day one. Slightly frustrating. Mostly because the day I wanted to start and get a badge I was in a good mood and now I'm in a terrible one after I had to deal with a bunch of bullshit and relapsed twice. God, I sound like a child whining over a toy. Like I'm actually anxious that I set myself back three days and now I feel three days behind everybody in this subreddit.

Running

I didn't want to be a smoker anymore. I didn't want to feel embarrassed by the smell and sneak smoke breaks every chance I got. 

I started running. I soon noticed that it was hard to breathe, and felt wrong lighting up right after a run. I came to realize that I didn't really need cigarettes anymore, and that the running alone was giving me the stress reduction I craved. I also wanted to improve my times and knew it just wouldn't be possible while smoking. 

Of course, it was hard and I still went through tough withdrawals, but being able to breathe and run with no limitation just made me feel so amazing I couldn't go back to smoking. 

Just wanted to share because I'm almost a month in and am so proud of myself and confident I won't go back to the disgusting habit. 

P.S. One reason it took a while for me to quit smoking is that I knew the health effects and honestly didn't care if it shortened my life expectancy, etc. I was depressed and stressed with work. I wasn't thinking ahead. If any of you are in this position I recommend just giving quitting a shot because I for one absolutely feel better and actually found smoking was contributing to the depression.

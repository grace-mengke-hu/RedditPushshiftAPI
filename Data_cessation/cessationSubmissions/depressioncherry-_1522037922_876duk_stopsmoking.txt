Almost at the 2 week milestone. I’m finally so bored of being unhealthy.

I haven’t smoked for nearly 2 weeks and it’s made me realise I should make myself healthier in other parts of my life too. Fuck being unfit. 5’11 / 89kg / (ex) 20 a day smoker. Time to hit the gym and get my body back in shape. 

My goals: Gym 5 times a week, 1700 calories a day, 0 cigarettes a day. 

The urge to smoke is so bad!

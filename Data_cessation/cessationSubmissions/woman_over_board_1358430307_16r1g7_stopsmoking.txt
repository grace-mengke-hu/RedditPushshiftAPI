Lets bring up our morale - what are the benefits of quitting? 

I would love to read how quitting has turned your life for the better - what expected and unexpected benefits did you notice since you quit? 

I'll start:

- not stinking like an old ashtray

- removing social stigma

- being able to breathe better

- getting healthier in general

- saving bunch of money

- being able to enjoy incence sticks (which are not a waste of money anymore)

- having more energy

- being more relaxed

- finally getting rid of feeling perpetually smoky lungs and slime laden throat

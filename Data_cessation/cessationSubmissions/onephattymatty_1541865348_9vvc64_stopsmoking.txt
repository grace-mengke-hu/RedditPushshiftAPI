23 days

This is my first post. I have been smoke-free for 23 days! So far I'm not wheezing in my chest, which was really beginning to bother me. I can smell things that I thought were long past.  I hang out at the last smoking place in our town, sometimes it's difficult but honestly, I have been in the frame of mind to quit for a long time, and even if the smoke is just wafting towards me or whatever, I know that I do not want to do it. So it's been rather easy.

For those just getting started, remember what your doing this for. And as you go along your path you find other motivations to not smoke. BE strong! Not one puff! EVER!

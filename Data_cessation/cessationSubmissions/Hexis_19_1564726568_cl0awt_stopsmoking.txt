I messed up... 25 days down the drain for no fucking reason.....

So I quit smoking cigarettes and weed at the same time and tonight I made a mistake.... I smoked 5 cigarettes back to back and I smoked a couple joints that someone left at my house that I meant to throw away.... I feel like shit because now I have to postpone joining the army and I donâ€™t know what went through my head.......

23 minutes in!

23 minutes in! I have decided to quit smoking! There are so many reasons why I need to! I have been a smoker for 13 years. Ugh! I have tried to quit before but always end up going for that one cigarette, and whelp that leads to another and another.... (you know how that ends). I am now 26 minutes smoke free! 
Tomorrow is going to be tough! I just joined this group from the smoke free app recommendation, and Im hoping to see everyoneâ€™s success and encouraging words will help me through the next few days!

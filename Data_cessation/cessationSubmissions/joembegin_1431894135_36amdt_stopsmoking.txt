I'm ready, guys

I've been considering quitting for so long, I just never had the strength â€“ or was maybe too afraid.

I've had bronchitis all year and have been to the doctor 5 times since January. I'm tired all the time, COUGHING all the time, and can't do cardio for shit. 

I've finally decided today is the day! It's currently 4:30 in the afternoon and I've suppressed all the cravings (thank you nicotine patches) but I'm scared for tomorrow; cigarettes help me through the weekday and I just don't know if I can deal with the stress without my hourly cigarette breaks. 

Any tips? Advice? Thoughts? I'm terrified.

1 year! woohoo!

So, it wasn't even all that bad. I didn't read Alan Carr, but I definitely got what I needed to make it happen from this sub. Little snippets of advice, things to tell myself why I should quit, etc.

For those of you thinking about quitting, here's the biggest thing that helped me quit and helps me when, even a year in, I still get cravings: the only enjoyment you're getting out of having a cigarette is relief from the withdrawal symptoms you're experiencing every time you finish a smoke. It's just a treadmill of withdrawal -> relief from withdrawal. I'll admit, every now and then it enhanced a pleasurable situation, and those are still some hard triggers that I still deal with today, but 99% of the cigarettes I used to smoke were only treating the withdrawals.

Also, I had really bad anxiety issues for a long time. Smoking was amping these up to the next level. This is all gone now. Instead of treating the anxiety with a cig and then letting the anxiety of withdrawals crank the knob to 11, I deal with the anxiety head on.

Anywho, I feel bad that today is the day I unsub. I really wish I could do more to help people quit in here, but honestly a lot of the cravings I have lately are from just seeing the subreddit name :( Thank you all for your help, and keep up the good work those of you who are currently quit, whether it's for an hour or for a decade. It's not that hard and the grass is SO much greener on the other side, you'll thank yourself for it :)

Farewell, /r/stopsmoking!

It's good to be back.

I have had a violent bout of the flu for the past 5 days and have not been able to smoke at all, coming from a pack a day.  I recently quit, with all you fine folks as support, for 7 months cold-turkey, but I relapsed somewhere around November or December.  This time, I've had it.

I've been smoking an average of at least a pack a day for almost a decade now, and I am utterly sick of it.  Since my body is purging my lungs anyway, I am seizing this opportunity, despite my half-full pack, and just stopping now.

Since today was the first day I felt that my lungs could actually handle a cigarette without internal bleeding and I *chose* not to smoke, today marks the day that I quit.  Wish me luck folks, if all goes well I'll be with you guys for a long time.

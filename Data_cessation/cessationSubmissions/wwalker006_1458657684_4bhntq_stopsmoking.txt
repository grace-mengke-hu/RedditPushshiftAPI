Go buy some toothpicks!

I tried so many times to quit smoking. I bought gum, e-cigs, tried cold turkey, tried not buying packs but buming was ok, nothing worked. The last time I tried to quit I was at Costco and came across a big box of deli toothpicks. It dawned on me maybe if I just chewed on toothpicks all day to sooth my cravings to have something on my mouth (no homo). That day was January 28 and I haven't had a smoke since. I wasn't even planning on quitting that day. I bought the toothpicks and just always had a handful on me and just chewed on them all day every day and it worked so well. I would take them out drinking, take them to class, while driving, while doing work at my desk. I replaced my morning cig and coffee with my morning coffee and toothpicks. For whatever reason this method really worked for me because the more I craved the more toothpicks I would chew and there was no repercussions for chewing alot of toothpicks. Quitting has changed my life and if anyone is feeling like nothing out there works, give this a shot.

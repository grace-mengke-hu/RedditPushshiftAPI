Lead by example. I quit.

I've been a pack a day smoker for nearly 15 years, and I'm only 30. I've always considered myself a strong willed person, but each time I've tried quitting I've used a replacement product as a crutch, and failed. This time it's pure willpower, and failure isn't an option.

I run a custom fabrication business, and I've always allowed my guys to smoke inside the shop because I did. I'm 4 days in and theyre starting to take note. Yesterday one of my younger guys asked if I quit, and said he was going to as well... he's chewing gum like it's what I pay him for, but I haven't seen him burn one since.

Some of my older guys are starting to bust our balls about quitting, but I think we're more of an influence on them than they are on us. I'm hoping for a smoke free work zone without even needing to enforce it. I'm going to offer for the company to pay for any replacement products my guys may want to try if any more of them is interested in joining me.

I feel like I need to be a rock for my guys, and that midset is helping me stay the course, so hopefully with a little incentive some of them will make their own decision to quit as well.

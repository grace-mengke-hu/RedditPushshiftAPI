Anyone else had drinking problems after quitting?

I've noticed that since I've stopped smoking that my drinking had got out of control. It's not that I suddenly have trouble keeping down my liquor, it's that I'm losing control and drinking way too much. I've been able to drink like a normal person, to enjoy my alcohol, to stop when I felt it's enough, but ever since I'm smoke free I tend to get blackout drunk. I stopped drinking altogether after a pretty embarrassing night which is a shame because I really used to enjoy my liquor. Did anyone else had a similar problem and have you found a way to deal with it?

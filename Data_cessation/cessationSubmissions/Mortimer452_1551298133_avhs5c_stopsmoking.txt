Day 1 of zero nicotine completed after 30 years

This has been the first day in 30+ years that my body has been without nicotine.  I quit smoking about 4-5 years ago, switched to using vape, been using that ever since.  I just sorta decided the other day, I started vape just to quit smoking, I accomplished that, why am I still vaping?

I started slowly dropping my nic level back from 12mg down to 3mg over the past several months.  Yesterday was my first day with zero puffs on the vape.  Headaches started today, Tylenol helps.  Taking a puff is literally all I'm thinking about right now, I get that weird "taste" on the back of my tongue that's only satisfied with a puff or two.  

There are certain things in life, such as drinking coffee or having a beer, that I just couldn't picture myself doing without a smoke or vape.  Then one day it occurred to me, millions of people are doing just that, it's obviously possible, how hard can it be?

Just found another pleasure not smoking

I went out on my balcony to take a pic a joke for a friend of mine and I live on the 14th floor.  Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr it is a bit cold out there.  This is the same balcony I used to go out on and smoke.  So glad I am not putting myself through that any more :)

Also, yesterday I walked almost 3km and I felt amazing when I got home.

Quitting, starting today.

Ok guys, here it goes - I'm 32 and have been smoking since I was 15. That's more than half my life done, and I'm really starting to feel the effects of it in my lungs and energy levels. I decided to quit - for my girlfriend, for my parents, for myself - and am 8 hours away from my official "quit." Current gameplan is to invest in an e-cig and step down nicotine levels until I forget about the damned thing, lol. Was considering Chantix but holy shit that seems like a terrifying drug. Don't really know why I'm making this post except to affirm to myself "yes, I am doing this." Thank you.

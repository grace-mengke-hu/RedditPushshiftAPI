Just played my first gig without smoking. Wasn't hard at all! Awesome. Thank all of you for the support so far!

It's 5 am now and I'm drinking a glass of wine before bed. My girlfriend left here cigarettes on the couch (yeah she still smokes...) and the thought of lighting one seems ludicrous. I feel great after only five (nearly six) days! My only regret is not quitting sooner.

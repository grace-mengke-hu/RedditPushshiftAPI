I've been off cigarettes for two days now, feel as though I'm losing my mind.

Two days ago I decided to quit smoking for good. I started smoking when I was 16 (I'm 19 now) and up to this point I was smoking about half a pack a day. Without my death-sticks I feel like absolute shit. I've been downing coffee like a maniac and I've gone through more sticks of gum than I care to admit. 

Hope I can keep this up, but I'm hurting here. Any advice on something to stop this fucking anxiety?

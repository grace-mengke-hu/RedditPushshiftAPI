Cleansing lungs

I started smoking since I was 9. I’m now 21. Had some breaks inbetween but my lungs are pretty much screwed at this point. I know the lungs heals naturally after quitting. 

I’ve been doing research and saw some herbs and fruits might help to speed up the process. 
Have you guys tried cleansing and what did you do? 

On my list now are pineapple, raw honey, tumeric and would like to know more about it.

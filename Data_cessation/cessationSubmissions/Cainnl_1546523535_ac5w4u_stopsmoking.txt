Here we go

So, here I am. Threw my last cigarette away the first of January at 1PM. Smoke since I was 15 and I am 37 now. Switched to vaping for quite some time, but went back to smoking during my nights out. Didn't drink one drop of alcohol in 2018 and decided to go cold turkey with the nicotine in 2019 too.

No alcohol and no nicotine (hopefully) ever again. One thing I know for sure though: It was much easier staying away from alcohol than from those damn cigarettes/nicotine.

Anyways:   


2 days, 1 hour and 51 minutes.

Boyfriend is trying to quit after I quit

First off, happy to say I'm over a month off nicotine now :). I feel free! The cravings are rare and tiny, and the mood swings are gone.

I didn't realize until just like an hour ago how stressed my boyfriend is from quitting, though. He is on day 2 or 3 and kept yelling about things as he was cooking for us :(. All I could do was be silent and hold him. He said his aunt chewed him out for screwing up the dinner in some areas. Yeah he did, but I don't think she was being as hard as he made it out to be and I think he was overreacting hardcore. We are having a long weekend together doing things though, so I get to watch him :).

I'm just asking what I can do to help him, or just general advice. I have only really been in a relationship this long one other time, and that was ten years ago, so I am really inexperienced here. And I dunno if this really helps, but it is a same sex male relationship. Thanks guys!

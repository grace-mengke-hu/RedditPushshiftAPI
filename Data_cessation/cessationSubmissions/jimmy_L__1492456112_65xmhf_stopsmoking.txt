Headaches after nearly 3 months?

Hey guys

So I quit smoking around 3 months ago, but I am still experiencing headaches every day, as well as quite a bit of brain fog.  I've heard before that the headaches only last a few days after quitting, but mine have been on going for some time now. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

Until quitting smoking I have never experienced headaches really at all. 

Thanks!

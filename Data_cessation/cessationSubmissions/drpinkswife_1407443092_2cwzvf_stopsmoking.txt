Long, long, long, long, long day....

Husband stung by wasp in sleep at 4:30 this morning. I had to 'handle' it:

* Ice
* Painkillers
* Benedryl
* Kill wasp
* Listen to rant about wasps and the sneaky bastards they are

By then it was just after 5am and since the sun would come up soon and I wasn't going back to sleep, went for the run I planned for 8am.

Got home stretched, listen to more slurs about the yellow and black insects. Didn't have to be to work for 5 hours so tried for a nap.

Work was long. But soon it was over and my headphones were on and I was walking home. My boss was right behind me. We aren't buddies.  Followed me home. Gave obligatory tour of new home (which is in a complete state of slovenliness). 

My focus now:

* exercise
* not smoking
* eating well

What my focus is not; **housekeeping**. I was brought up to have a very clean house, it currently is not and that made me feel like a slob. Awesome. :|

Smashed my knee on the underside of the counter, *hard*. Had to re-hem trousers for tomorrow. Dead tired. Can't manage to cook more than toast.

Not feeling like I can be supportive today. Sorry.

But I have no desire to smoke. :)

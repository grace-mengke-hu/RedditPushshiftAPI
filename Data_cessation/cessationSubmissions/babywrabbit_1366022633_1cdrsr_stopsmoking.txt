Familial motivation, even without family

I'd smoked since I was 14. I'm 29 now. I quickly moved from being a light to a heavy smoker, and as of 3 months ago I smoked a bit over a pack a day. I started by stealing smokes from my parents.

My father was diagnosed with small cell adenocarcinoma this past November. He died mid-March and I didn't get a chance to talk to him after he told me the news --- his body was quickly ruined. He had smoked since he was 13. He was 54 when he died. I was chain smoking the stuff that killed him when he told me the news. 

All those pictures on cig packs, plus the warnings/isolation you see/feel every day might not make it seem worth it to quit. Even crazy tax increases might not deter a dedicated smoker. I smoked a ton because they were available. Now I'm 70 days free, and I will never smoke again. It's a legacy my father can leave, and one you can try not to ever leave. I was always one of those "I have an addictive personality, I was born into it, I feel fine so to hell with it" kind of smokers. I did it for 15 years, and I'm clean now. You can do it too. :)

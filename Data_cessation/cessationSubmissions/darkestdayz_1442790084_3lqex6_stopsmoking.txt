In case any of you need a reason to just quit right now...

I had a CT scan yesterday due to diagnosing a possible kidney stone. The scan also showed a 3mm node in my lower left lung. I'll be following up with my pulmonary doctor tomorrow. Granted it's more then likely benign at the moment, just knowing there's something there that has to be watched, I'm freaking the hell out. I haven't smoked in almost 2 years but was a 30+ year pod smoker. This is something that I will have to worry about and closely monitor for the rest of my life.

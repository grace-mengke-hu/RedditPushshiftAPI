Quit cold turkey 4 days ago and it's going pretty well

I was actually planning on reading the widely promoted book by Allen Carr, but I got bored after a few pages. Nonetheless, 1 thing did stick with me, that is the way one should look at quitting smoking. In my previous attempts to quit, I would take my last puff and meanwhile regret it's going to be the last, already missing it before I was even done. Somehow I had a complete mindshift, where I was smoking my last cigarette past Sunday and thinking: why am I smoking you anyway? I don't need you and and your toxicity.

This proved to be very effective, because to be honest I haven't had any major cravings. When I encounter smoking people, instead of wanting to join them, I feel pity for them -- not a value judgement, but because they're still caving in to the addiction.

I've tried to quit many times, but during all those times I felt I wasn't going to make it, not going to be able to resist the temptation. This time it's different, because basically there is no temptation, only disgust.

Just wanted to share my experience with you, and to all who want to quit but have not managed to yet, I hope this can help you in some way.

Going out tonight

I'm on day 4 after 4 years of smoking, which I know isn't much but I genuinely haven't craved a cigarette all day which is weird but who's complaining? 


Anyway I'm going out tonight for a friend's birthday. This is the hurdle I fell at last time I tried to quit, because when I'm drunk I make bad decisions. I'm confident about tonight, but all my friends smoke and I'm gonna be drinking so I really hope I don't cave.


If any of you have been in my situation please let me know how you got through it.

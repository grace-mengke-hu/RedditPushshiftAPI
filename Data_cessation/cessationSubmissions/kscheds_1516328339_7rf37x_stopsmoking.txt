Does anyone else dream about smoking?

I quit smoking October 1, 2017 but I swear at least once I week I have this dream that I’m craving a cigarette so bad that I have one. In the dream they are always awful. And then I’m filled with such shame and regret thinking I have to start my counter over away. 

Sometimes even the next day I still feel that regret of “smoking” wtf am I crazy?

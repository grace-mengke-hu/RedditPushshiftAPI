I win....I'm sure this won't work forever

Me: I'm going to make a tart tomorrow. I need to buy a tart pan.
Husband: Where are you going to store all these new cooking gadgets?
Me: You're right, cigarettes take up much less room.
Husband: What I really think you need is a tart pan. I think you should buy tart pan right away. Can I go buy you a tart pan?

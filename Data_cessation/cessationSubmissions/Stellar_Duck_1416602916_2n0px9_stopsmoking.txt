Ack! I relapsed!

So, after a real shitty week at work today I was waiting for the bus. Decided to go buy a soda while I was waiting and ended up buying a pack as well. Fuck me, right?

So, now I've smoked some of that pack and feeling decidedly silly. They taste like crap. So I'll soak them and bin them when I'm done typing this.

I'm unsure how I should think about this though. I intend to go back on the wagon so to speak come the morning, as I really don't want to do this shit anymore, but I feel like I kinda messed up badly. Still, I reckon it should be salvageable. 

What say the hivemind? Should I just get back to quitting and consider this a speed bump or should I be super hard on myself?

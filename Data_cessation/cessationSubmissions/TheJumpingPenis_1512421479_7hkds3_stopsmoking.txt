Quit smoking when you're sick

I've been vaping since January of 2015, and had my last puff on Saturday night. I had some awful pains on sunday morning due to having a fever and not smoking, and today the cravings are high. But i'm already through this pain. Every time i crave a puff, i take a couple of deep breaths and a sip of water. 

I figured why not suffer nicotine withdrawals while i'm sick. If i smoke, i suffer. if i don't, i suffer. My goal is to be nicotine free in 2018 and beyond. I wish everybody the best of luck in your journey!

Almost a month in, here's how I've done it so far for anyone else who is struggling

It's not easy, it's gotten a *little* easier but not to the point I see some people at where they're done for good. I still crave them, I never wanted to quit because I was one of those people who smoked because *I enjoy smoking a cigarette*. Never thought it was an addiction because I always made a conscious decision to go out for a smoke, and I've realized after almost 4 weeks how powerless I actually was whenever I lit up.

Anyway, here's what I've been doing that has helped:

1) **4mg Nicotene lozenge packs.** Buy the $40 80 pack from Target that comes in pocket pill bottles (mint flavor). There's something about sucking on a lozenge that satisfies the craving to go out for a smoke, and the nicotine in one lozenge is 1/3 the nicotine of a cigarette but for some reason it feels more powerful than a cig. Don't judge yourself for "not quitting cold turkey." Cut yourself some slack, it's okay to pop a mint lozenge in place of it. Eventually you can replace the lozenges with tic-tacs or altoids and be a totally normal human being. This also helps keep you from grinding your teeth if you're a tooth grinder like me.

2) **Tell EVERYONE that you're quitting.** There are times that I almost caved, and didn't for the sole reason that I didn't want to be judged by coworkers, friends, family, etc. when I walked back in wreaking like an ash tray.

3) **Step out with the smokers.** Sounds like a copout but there's something to be said for second-hand smoke. I go outside to the smoker pole at work and pop a lozenge and talk to the smokers and hear their various "I quit for a couple weeks once" stories as they take a drag. I'm also reminded that I don't want to be that person in a month, so I hold out longer because of it. I also think it has made me more desensitized to the mouth-watering smell of a cigarette.

4) **Drinking a lot less.** Drinking was / is a huge trigger for me. If I do drink I typically find myself popping 2-3 lozenges at once, then I get hiccups and strike up a conversation with someone and boom the craving is gone.

5) **Eating less and drinking tea instead of coffee.** There's nothing like a cup of coffee and a cigarette in the morning, or a nice smoke after a big fat meal to ease the digestion. Avoid both of those by eating smaller meals and drinking tea instead of coffee.

6) **Feng shui** - the concept of changing your environment every couple weeks. This extends beyond rearranging furniture though. Take a different route to work, go in a different door, eat lunch at a different time, walk the dog on a different route. Change your lifestyle holistically and you'll find that your body doesn't have an internal "smoke time" or "smoke place." It's gotten to the point where I don't even crave a smoke until 3 in the afternoon, where as a smoker I was going out every hour or so starting when I woke up.

7) **Download a mindless game on your phone.** I play chess on my phone when I'm bored at home, and idle time is when the cravings are the worst. I distract my brain with a game of chess whenever I crave a smoke at home and by the time I'm done an hour has passed and sometimes so has the craving. Sometimes the craving doesn't pass, but at least I went an hour without smoking and can justify having another lozenge while I throw on an episode of narcos or rewatch game of thrones.

I'm by no means a model of success, 26 days isn't necessarily something to brag about and sometimes it feels like it's only been a week. But these are things that have been working for me!

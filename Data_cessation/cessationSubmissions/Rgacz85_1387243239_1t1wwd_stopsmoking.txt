I'm doing it for my friend

I started using tobacco products around 2 1/2 years ago. I started with chewing tobacco, graduated to social smoking, and finally worked my way to smoker. I enjoyed it a lot but knew I eventually wanted to kick the habit. What triggered my urge to stop smoking was the death of my good friend Colin. At the age of 18 Colin was diagnosed with brain cancer, three days ago, at the age of 19, he passed away. I thought "how could I be so selfish? He would have given anything for one more day and here I am smoking my life away." Anyway I just began my journey and I'm at about 40 hours without a tobacco product. I feel great and I hope I can continue on my path in Colin's honor.

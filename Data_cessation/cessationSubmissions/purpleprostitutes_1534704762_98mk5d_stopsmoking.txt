1 month quit

I'm officially 1 month off smokes and about 2 weeks off of NRT! I feel amazing and empty at the same time, which is weird. My major concern is that I still think about smoking pretty much all day, especially during trigger moments like driving or after eating. I definitely need a hobby. What are some hobbies you all picked up after quitting that have helped?

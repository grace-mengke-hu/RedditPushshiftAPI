Hung out with smokers yesterday and I couldn't be more proud!

I'll admit, seeing them smoke made me want 'just one hit' but I once again stayed strong because we all know it's never 'just one'.

I hadn't been trusting myself and so I avoided hanging out with people that I knew smoked.


I received a lot of positive feedback actually to my surprise!  The people that did smoke confessed they wanted to quit and started asking me how I did it, how it feels, etc.

When I said I was over 2 months nicotine-free I got a lot of high fives; it took me completely by surprise that I was sort of an inspiration :)

It made me feel so much more confident in my decision to be a non-smoker although I'm still kind of adjusting a bit. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share that if you feel a little ping of jealousy over someone smoking - the chances are they are more jealous of you for being able to quit I feel like.

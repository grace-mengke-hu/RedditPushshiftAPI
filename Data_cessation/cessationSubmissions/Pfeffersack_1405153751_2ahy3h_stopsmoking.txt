Thank you, stopsmoking. You didn't turn my life around but...

...you definitely made quitting easier. Maybe I was getting hooked on cigarettesâ€”I don't know. However, what I can say I'm absolutely certain I won't try them again.

If you're reading this and you're not sure if you want to abstain for one year (because you think you're not addicted) don't hesitate to add a counter.

Woo 150 days

Wow, a lot has gone down over the last 150 days.  Changing jobs, ending a LONG term relationship, and taking the most strenuous load of engineering classes I've had in my 4 years of college.  

I knew that if I could remain smoke free through all these serious life events I could do it through anything.  I am playing (full-court) basketball for 2-3 hours at a time now, which I haven't done since high school.

Inspirational excerpt from House of Cards:

> I’m Doug and I’m an alcoholic.  One of the things I do for a living is count.  I count votes.  Yays, nays, neutrals, abstaining.  And I’m good at it.  But the most important count I do has nothing to do with work.  It’s the number of days since April 4th, 1999.  As of this morning that’s 5,185.  The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me because I know all it takes is one drink for that number to go back to zero.

> Most people see fear as a weakness.  It can be.  Sometimes for my job I have to put fear in other people.  I know that’s not right.  But if I’m honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless.  Because failure is not an option.  The same goes for my sobriety.  I have to be ruthless with myself.  I have to use my fear.  It makes me stronger.

> Like everyone else in this room, I can’t control who I am.  But I can control the zero.

> Fuck the zero.

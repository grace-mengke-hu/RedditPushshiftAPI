Great excuses...

So I've got this mental game going where I imagine my addiction is an alien inhabitant of my body that I am trying to exorcise out. Because I've already decided that I am a nonsmoker, I have been constantly surprised by these crazy thoughts that almost make me do a 180.  My addition is such an asshole and here are some of the things it tells me that I've found compelling (but have been able to resist!):

* You made the decision to quit too quickly, you didn't think it out, you need more time.  Go smoke.

Nope. Any time you quit is the right time. If you let the addiction be your guide, the time to quit is never.   

* It's just one quick cigarette

Your first cigarette ever was also just one cigarette, how many cigarettes ago was that exactly?  It's never, ever, ever just one cigarette. One cigarette is followed by another, by thousands. 

* Dude, its fate. You found the cigarette fair and square in your car, you weren't looking for it.  Just light it.

This made me weak and laugh for a good long minute before I tore the cigarette to pieces and threw it away.  There is no 'free' cigarette. See number 2.

* People fall off the wagon all the time, and they get back on. Go have your smoke and quit again tomorrow.

I'm a nonsmoker and addiction, the one thing getting off this wagon is you. 

* So what, this is your life? You aren't ever going to smoke? Who are you kidding? You failed before, you'll fail again. Go smoke!

Respond with some of yours?

edit: decided to post some of my responses because after reading it, I got an urge and wanted to remind myself....

Quit due to pregnancy. Want to continue.

I quit at the end of December when I found out I was pregnant. I am 29 and smoked since I was 16. I have 2 children and always started back after I was done breastfeeding. I don't want to this time. I have no urges to smoke and no desire. How do I keep this up when a child isn't the reason?

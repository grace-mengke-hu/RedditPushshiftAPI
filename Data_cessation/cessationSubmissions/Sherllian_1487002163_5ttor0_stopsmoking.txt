Day 3. Freaking out. HELP!

I really want to quit this time. I managed to quit once before only because I had a huge cold and, when it passed, cigarettes tasted really bad. But I got back on when my grandmother fell ill and passed away and now I want to quit again. And it's hard. It's so hard. I'm at a point in life where I'm gonna start my first job and I really need to find a room to rent and there's nothing on offer that I can afford and that's stressing me to no end and I really feel like a puff would calm things down but I KNOW it won't.

I need help, I need to know what I can do to survive this horrible third day without smoking.

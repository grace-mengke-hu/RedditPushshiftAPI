A nice thought: temporarily quit my job while quitting smoking...... ugh

I took a week off from work to quit smoking. I've attempted to quit smoking more times than I can count in the past year. 
Trying to get a total of 9 days of no smoking before I go back. Most people at my work smoke which makes it even more difficult. 

I'm on day 5 and I'm feeling all sorts of shit. Proud, pissed, frustrated, happy, optimistic, overly emotional. Also, horrible heartburn.....is that normal?

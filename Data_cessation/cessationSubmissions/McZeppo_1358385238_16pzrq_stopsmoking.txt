Addiction is starting to get worse

So here I am trying to quit smoking completely with the help of all of you guys. I certainly don't consider myself a heavy smoker. I maybe smoke 5 cigarettes per day sometimes more sometimes less. 
There are periods in my life in which i don't even feel the need to smoke and i'm often clear for like 2-3 weeks. However my smoking times outweigh my abstinence. It's pretty weird that my addiction isn't always the same. Does anyone of you feel that too?

My biggest weakness is alcohol of course. After every successful attempt partying screws it all over again and i start smoking regularly again. 

Another important thing about me is that i absolutely HATE every cigarette. I wash my hands after every cigarette when i'm at home i spit constantly while smoking because they taste like crap and i become nervous (it's like soft forms of anxiety really).
During these times i only smoke because of addiction... There is no joy in doing it at all.
I'm 23 years old and smoke for 6 years now. Even if it is not all that much all the time i still quite couldn't get over it to quit it long term...

but i can say one thing: Because i have times without smoking i can tell everybody here that you really start to recognize positive effects without it. The first 2-3 days i always recognize a loss in concentration and maybe i a little bit of aggressiveness but when you are a week in you start to feel more agile and your breathing becomes much better...

So from now on i will go the way with you guys. Let's fight these stupid cancer sticks. If you have the urge to smoke always say to yourself: "This is only my brain urging for the next nicotine fix. It's not my personality. My body can't possibly need this unhealthy crap and I as a person don't need it either!" 
Why would you burn something down your lungs? 

Together we can make it! Cheers

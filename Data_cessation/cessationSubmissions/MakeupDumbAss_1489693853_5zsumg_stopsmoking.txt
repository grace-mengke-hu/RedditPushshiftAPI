Day 4 without smoking.

Day 1 and 2 were rough, day 3 felt better, but day 4 has been the hardest yet.  For me the worst part is that I can't focus on much & my mind is really scattered.  It makes working really difficult, which stresses me out, which really makes me think of you-know-what.  I'm not going to smoke & blow the progress I've already made, but damn I can't wait until it gets easier.  It's exhausting being so frustrated and uncomfortable all the time.

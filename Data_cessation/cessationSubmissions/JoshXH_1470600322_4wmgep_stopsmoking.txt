26, been on 20+ a day for 9yrs. Help?

Decided I want to quit, I'm over spending $100+ a week on a bad habit.
My main problem is, every time I've tried to quit before I've woken up of a morning coughing and hacking until I've had a smoke. This goes on for a few days to a week; I've gotten that far once, ended up caving to the craving. 
Is there any way to reduce or get rid of the coughing?

Weird Things, 32 Days In

so, i've made it one month in! i've eaten at least 100 dum-dum lollipops. i can't even count the number of clean deep breaths i've taken in lieu of nicotine-laden breaths. i can't count the number of times i've thought "I'm so glad I don't smoke anymore", it happens so many times a day!

here's the weird thing that is happening: i can smell things now. is this how things actually smell? it's been almost 40 years and things are kind of ... smelly. not necessarily in a bad way. the best way i can describe this odor is kind of like when the clothes dryer gets way too hot, or the blow dryer. or sort of hot and dusty lightbulb smell. but i've cleaned the lampshades and replaced the bulbs... 

i guess i'm just wondering... is this what nic-free life smells like?

I figured it out.

I've been having a real struggle this last 10 days or so and I finally figured it out. I love micro achievements. I love doing better this time than I did last time. Since I've surpassed my previous quit record (30 days, thanks jail!) My brain is trying to get me to start over with this new "best record" as a goal to beat. Now that I've named it I can beat it.

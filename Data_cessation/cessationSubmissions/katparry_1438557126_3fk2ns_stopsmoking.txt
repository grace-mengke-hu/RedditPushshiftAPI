It has been two weeks since my last cigarette. I just started to have cravings today.

I have done the silliest thing, which is pair my smoking habit with my instrument playing. After a week in Hawaii I am back home and I am very excited to play my piano, however it is in the garage, and it is where I usually smoke and play. because of this craving I am avoiding going to play the piano. Help! thanks

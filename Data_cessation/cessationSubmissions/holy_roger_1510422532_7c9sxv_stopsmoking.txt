Cold Turkey 11th day.....40 to 0....and I now know why I tried this.....

I was breathless

I was a mess

I always thought of myself as a loser

I had no focus

I had no committment to anything

I had no plans

I was just drifting around

I felt generally bad

I felt like a piece of wreckage

I had no self esteem

I didnt have any reason to respect myself

I thought I was weak willed

I thought I had no determination

I was like a zombie

I felt like a container of poison

I wanted to do something good to myself

I wanted to believe I was not finished....not yet

I wanted to see if I still had a fight left

I wanted to know how it feels like to be in control

I wanted to resurrect myself

I have kept my promise for 11 days....lets see what lies ahead....

Day 1 again, and I'm fucking terrified.

I'm lying in bed, my mind racing about going through another withdrawal - meanwhile my thesis presentation is in 4 days, the report deadline in 2 weeks.

I keep seeing posts about people having cravings 4 months in, and feel like I will never get better.

But I literally have to do nothing - not smoking isn't an activity.

I just need to walk through hell one step at a time, and keep faith that it will get easier.

I need a hug.

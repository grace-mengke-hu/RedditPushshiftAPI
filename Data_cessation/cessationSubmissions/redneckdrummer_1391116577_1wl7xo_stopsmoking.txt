Trying it again

Well, /r/stopsmoking, the day has come again. My new years resolution was to quit smoking weed and cigarettes. I'm now 2 days sober after 2 years of daily toking, and /r/leaves has been an excellent community to me, check that out if you're trying to get off the bud.

I tried quitting cigarettes once before, and failed. I'm now unemployed, and don't have a dollar to my name (I'm a freshman in college, living with my parents so I'm not on the street or anything) so for the foreseeable future I won't be able to buy any smokes. 

I have cut down from over a pack a day to maybe 5 or 6 a day, so it should be easier this time around.

Wish me luck, and keep quitting guys, we got this.

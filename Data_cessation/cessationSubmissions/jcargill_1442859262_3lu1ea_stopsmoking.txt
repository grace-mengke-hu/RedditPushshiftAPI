First day (again)! Excited this time!

Okay, I've been trying to quit and not had the follow-through for about a month now.

Yesterday I bought the patch, and stuck it on this morning. Usually by now I'm irritable and would KILL (metaphorically) for a smoke... Today, nothing! 

I've never smoked at work (therapist at mental health clinic, work with kids), so the morning wasn't too bad. I was pretty nervous about going home at lunch though. I usually smoke 2-3 in that hour to shore up for 4 more hours of not, but, now that I'm home, I don't even want one!

I've got a sinus infection too, so I'm not sure if it's all the coughing this morning, or the patch, but I have literally zero desire to go smoke. I haven't experienced that in over 10 years!!!


Quick question though, I know withdrawal causes coughing, but what's the timeline for it? When does it start/end? I never had too much of a smokers cough...

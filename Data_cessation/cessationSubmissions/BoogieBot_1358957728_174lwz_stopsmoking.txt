2.5 weeks, feeling good!

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2.5 weeks! In that time, I've gone to 2 parties, drank (temptation then was ENORMOUS, but some shred of my sober mind stopped me), and been around countless smokers and I haven't screwed up!

The only time I find any real difficulty is when my mind wanders and I find myself imagining having a smoke and then my mouth starts to water - I know that visualizing it is the WORST thing I can do, so I try to direct my thoughts to something more productive instead. This usually means pulling out a stick of chewing gum and reading a few pages of whatever book I have on hand.

Congrats to those who've made it so far and good luck to those who are starting! You can do it and so can I!

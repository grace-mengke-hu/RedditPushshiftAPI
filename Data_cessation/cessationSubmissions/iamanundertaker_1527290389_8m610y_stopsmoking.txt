I'm on day 1.

I've quit before, but with the help of Champix. Had some unfortunate side effects, so I won't be using that again. 

I've been thinking of quitting for a while now for a number of reasons. I've become a bit of a hypochondriac too, so it doesn't help that smoking causes so many health issues. 

In any case, this morning I had 2 smokes in my pack. Had one with coffee, and one before starting work. Before I left home I knew I wasn't going to buy another pack. I just knew. Because I have an oral fixation and want to ease myself away from that, I have a vape. I made sure I could charge it before I left home and set out. The day was weird. I had a couple emotional spikes, where I was trying really hard not to cry. As the day at work progressed, I got better. I'm feeling pretty great right now. I feel "lighter", and encouragement from my coworkers was really helpful.

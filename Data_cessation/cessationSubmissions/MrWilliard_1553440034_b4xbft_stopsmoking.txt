I feel so dumb

Wanted to quit today. But then I woke up and found an half empty pack of cigarettes. So I was like hm ok then this will be my last ones. And now I almost finished the pack and already think about driving to the gas station to buy a new pack...
I feel so dumb, seriously. Maybe it isn’t my time yet? I don’t have the feeling that I really want to quit...

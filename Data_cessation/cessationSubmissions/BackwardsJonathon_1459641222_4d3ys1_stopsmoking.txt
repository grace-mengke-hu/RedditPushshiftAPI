Still a very long way to go, but it's a start!

A little context: I've been smoking since I was 15, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I started smoking consistently over a pack a day. I'm now 18 and for the last six months or so I've been smoking anything from 1-2 packs a day largely due to exam/studying stress and just feeling like a very addicted, weak teenage girl lol. I finally decided to seek help from this subreddit earlier this week, and got some really great advice!

Since Wednesday I've made some real improvements! I haven't stopped smoking altogether, but I've been smoking much less. My goal was to go back to school on Monday 4th (I've had this week off) smoking 5 cigarettes a day or less. So far I seem to be on track. I smoked 12 cigarettes on Wednesday, I think 9 Friday and 8 on Saturday (It's currently 12:50am Sunday morning and I'm about to go to bed, determined not to have another cigarette tonight!)


I know I've still go a very long way to go, but thank you for all the encouragement and advice everyone here has given me. It is extremely helpful!!

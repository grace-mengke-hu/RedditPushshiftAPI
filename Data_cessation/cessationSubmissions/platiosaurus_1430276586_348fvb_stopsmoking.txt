Well shucks To vape or not to vape

as i close out my third day of no nicotine I've yet to have any physical withdrawal symptoms thank god. It feels great not having those gnarly headaches, but my psychological withdrawal just kicked in in a big way. So i ask you, awesome non-smokers of Reddit, is vaping worth it? Has it worked to help anyone quit? and are you then able to quite vaping or does it just become another crutch?

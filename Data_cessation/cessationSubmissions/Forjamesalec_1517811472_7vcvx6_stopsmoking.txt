Now is the time.

I don’t know why it’s taken me this long. Fear, doubt, laziness? I spend almost all of my paycheck money outside of necessities on smoking. Honestly I’ve considered smoking a necessity for years now. My family tells me to stop, my so tells me to stop, even my damn brain tells me to stop. I spoke to a doctor the other day and she was telling me at least I’m trying to quit. I mean I have been trying almost nightly  for months and the last few weeks it went back to just being a passing thought. I can’t do it anymore.

It makes my aches and pains worse, gives me headaches, makes me lethargic, it doubles down on my depression which makes me sleep even more. I feel like part of it is that some weird part of me likes the lethargy because it takes my mind off of the depression and what I need to get done in my day. At least that’s the stupid lie my brain has concocted. I have OCD which turns this into one part physical and a million parts mental probably even more than the average smoker because now there’s lucky and unlucky days to quit, amounts to smoke. It’s all so stupid.

People keep telling me it’s gonna suck at first and really I think that avoidance of that fact has run out of steam. 

I’m quitting smoking for me, my family and my sanity most of all. It’s just not worth the cost of smoking anymore and it was never worth anything to begin with.

It’s time to quit. I quit after the cigarette I’m on now.

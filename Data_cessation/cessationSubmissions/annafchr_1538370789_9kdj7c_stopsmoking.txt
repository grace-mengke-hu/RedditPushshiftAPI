I’m approaching my year mark

I’m 22 and had been smoking since I was 15, I quit for 8 months in 2017 but now I’m rounding on a year tobacco free and it feels real this time. I still use a Juul though, but I feel so much healthier overall. Next to quit is vaping, but it helps so much curbing cravings. One day at a time guys it’s 100% worth it.

Six months into my apartment lease...

...and I just moved my trashcan onto the balcony because I haven't been back there since I quit smoking.  I should have moved into an apartment without one.

Seriously, I only ever get cravings when I go back there.  It's so little, it serves no other conceivable purpose.  It's useless.

What things do you find useless now that you've quit smoking?

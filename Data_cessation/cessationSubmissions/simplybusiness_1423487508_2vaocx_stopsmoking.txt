I finally made it past 100 days!

So I made it past 100 days cold turkey. I had been a smoker for 6 years and never got further than a few weeks. My little application tells me I haven't smoked 1415 cigarettes. The image of all of them sitting on a table in front of me or even worse filling up my lungs turns my stomach.

Best of luck to every other quitter out there, It gets easier everyday.

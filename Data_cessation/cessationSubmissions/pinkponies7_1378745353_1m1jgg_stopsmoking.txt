survived a Saturday at the bar!

The bar is always my biggest downfall in quitting. I'm in PA and at most bars, you're still allowed to smoke inside as long as their alcohol sales are greater than their food sales or some such thing. The bar I always go to allows smoking inside and some of my friends smoke, so I can easily bum one or buy them there (they also have a cig vending machine). In the past when I have tried to quit, I'd always end up getting drunk and saying "whatever one wont hurt right now" and then doing that enough times eventually leads to me getting the habit back.   In any case, I am so proud that this past Saturday I was at the bar and didn't light up at all! 118 Cigarettes not smoked still and about $32 saved!!

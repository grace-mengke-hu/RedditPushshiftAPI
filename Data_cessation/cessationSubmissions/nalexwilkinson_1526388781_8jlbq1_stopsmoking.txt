Trying to quit

I’ve never smoked cigarettes but I do about the equivalent to a pack a day with my juul (~1 pod a day). I always told myself I could quit whenever. Well...I lost my juul the other day and haven’t had a way to get a new one and it’s been the worst 36 hours of my life. I’m so so angry. I am getting weird twitches. Having panic attacks. I decided to drink last night to cope and that was a bad idea because now I’m hung over. But honestly something with this much control over my life shouldn’t be something I do for fun. I want to quit but this is kinda fucking hard. Any advice? How long will it be this bad? Tapering advice?

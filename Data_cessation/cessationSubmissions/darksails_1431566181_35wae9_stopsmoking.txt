Day Three Is A Real Bitch

OK so about 2/3 through day three.  I feel like it's getting a little bit better because instead of wanting to kill everyone I come into contact with, I have the patience to craft a list of specific individuals.  Improvement, right?  Actually, this is going pretty well.  I read the Carr book and stopped on Monday.  

Pretty funny the tricks my addiction will play.  My favorite is how my brain is nearly convinced that since quiting is so "easy" that having just one fag a day seems adequate. Not going to happen you little effing devil!  

LOVE this sub!!

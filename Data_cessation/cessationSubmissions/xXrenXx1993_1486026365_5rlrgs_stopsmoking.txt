About to quit and not feeling confident

I'm really needing support. I'm quitting tomorrow for numerous reasons like health, money and I have a 14 month old son who I don't want exposed to smoking. I'm 23 and my lungs feel like shit. I shouldn't be feeling like this. I've quit once before (when I found out I was pregnant) but this time is different. I want to quit for good!

Still going strong :-)

Met up with my baby sis last Friday, I live in Scotland and we actually had some lovely sunny weather, her and I done some shopping then went for a glass of wine, sitting out in the sunshine enjoying my wine and my sisters company. She still smokes and she said she was very impressed with me not smoking and because of this she is going to stop!! Just wanted to share xx

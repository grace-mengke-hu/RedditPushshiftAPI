Bad day at the office stress/losing power/brain dead co-workers. I want to smoke so bad. I have developed so many pet peeves over the last 4 days.

Someone, who is equally moody, just screamed what at me and I had to physically restrain myself for telling them to fuck off with the "what" shit.  I almost told someone else she is too stupid to work here, which may or may not be true.  And we keep losing power because of some storm.  Also, "uh huh" , "mmm" non word based communication is going to drive me to violence today, is it so hard to say "yes" and "no"?  Bah.  I don't want a cigarette, I want all of them.

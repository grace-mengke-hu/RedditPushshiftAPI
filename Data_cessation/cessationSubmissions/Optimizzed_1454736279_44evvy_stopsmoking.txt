You guys are great

Was just feeling really depressed - unrelated to smoking things. But, smoking has been my major demon my entire adult life. It has always been the thing that I felt kept me from doing other things I wanted to do. Anyway, I was feeling depressed, and after reading a bunch of your guys's posts I started to feel proud. I am becoming a better me. I don't make a lot of money, but not spending the $15 a day will do me wonders. I have a mental checklist of what I can buy, and will buy once my damn quit smoking counter has gone up more. I'll buy an expensive perfume, something I never bothered with because I knew I smelt bad anyway as a smoker. I can go to a dentist, get my teeth professionally cleaned and rid of all the smoking junk. I've never been to a dentist. I already have $500 in savings from the last couple months, the first time I've ever seen money add up in my savings account, it's so easy while not smoking and with my goal for a summer vacation in mind! Rant rant rant. Thanks for posting dudes. I feel better because of this subreddit

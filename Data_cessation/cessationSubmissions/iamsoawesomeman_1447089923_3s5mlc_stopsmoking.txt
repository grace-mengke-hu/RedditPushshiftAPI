Nightmares

So I smoked two cigarettes, messing up my longest streak of no smoking since I started 9 years ago, I was so disappointed in myself.

Luckily it was a nightmare :)

Wooohooo, so excited!

For the first couple of days I was having difficulty sleeping, now I'm fine. Actually the cravings haven't been too bad this time around. I was vaping for about 10 days before this quit, with no cigarettes, except in the back of my mind I was just wanting to not be addicted anymore! Also, at the end of those ten days I bought a pack and smoked a couple, then was like, I just need to stop the nicotine.  

I read a lot on http://whyquit.com/ as I was beginning my quit, helped understand what your cravings mean, and that I really don't want to smoke.

First time posting and I'm feeling very good about my final quit!

Long-time lurker here. I've been wanting to quit for some time now and I would come here to watch others' successes and I felt like it was time. Six days ago, I smoked my last and I didn't even want to finish that last one. 
Fast forward to today. I went on a run and stopped at a friend's place on the way way to my house. Everyone was continually smoking at my friend's, but I didn't even ask to bum a cigarette. I didn't have the urge to smoke and it convinced me that I'm now completely done.

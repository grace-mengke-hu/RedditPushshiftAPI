It's been super easy.... up until today

I'm 8 days into being a non-smoker and it has been a breeze up until last night/ today. I have the super strong urge to smoke and no matter what I tell myself, my brain is craving a smoke. I keep telling myself I'm a non-smoker and that there are no advantages to lighting up, but I'm struggling super hard today. The work day is not helping either.

I'm not too sure what I'm doing here. Guess I'm just venting a bit.

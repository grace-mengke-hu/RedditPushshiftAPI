I think writing this makes it a legitimate attempt at trying to quit. 48 hours.

I have not smoked a cigarette for 48 hours. I started at 17, I am 22. I figured I might as well quit while I can. 
Last night was rough, my head was bumping and I couldn't sleep that well. Been waking up with nasty coughs and feeling kinda shitty for no reason. I can't stop thinking about cigarettes.

But holy fuck, I can not wait until I can become a cigarette snob. I'm still going strong, when I go to gas stations I crave the routine addiction by buying gum instead. It's helped. I'm scared to fall, though. I will live with a big smoker in a month, and it's one of the things it made our friendship strong. Bonding over a cigarette.

Help on how to deal with that?

Hi all, 

I stopped this new year. So far so good. After 6 weeks I had mild digestive problem which still persists. But far better now. Have cravings now and then of course. I dream about smoking too sometimes. But have not let the guard down. 

I have been eating heavily then I used to and I think I have gained some weight. That is OK. 

Recently I felt strong cravings,  so I bought a fitness tracker and I have started walking now. 

Right in its face.

Mi band 2 if you are interested. Cheap and sexy!

Do anything that works but don't budge in.

Cheers guys!

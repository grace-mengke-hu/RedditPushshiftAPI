Happy to say it´s my 90th day

I barely think of smoking anymore. I replaced my "key" cigarretes with different things - cup of coffee here, glass of wine there, floss, etc.  Every now and then a different trigger reminds me of it but it´s more like a curiosity.  Unfortunately for me I can´t say my smell or taste has improved significantly (or at all), I still only can run 6 or 7 Km at 6 min per kilometer and my skin is not shining like an emo vampire in twilight, but I can use the extra money I haven´t spent in cigarettes, I don´t smell like an ashtray and I am not worried with long term nasty diseases anymore.  So good news, everyone! It´s worth it.

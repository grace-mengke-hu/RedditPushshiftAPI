Quit smoking + working out = no cravings

So I'm 12 days in, and on my quit day I decided to start working out as well. I've found that the working out/doing cardio makes me LOVE the fact that I can breathe easier! I have barely had a thought on smoking, and if I do I can easily go through it. So, for all of you thinking of quitting or struggling - try to do something that makes you aware of the good things about quitting! I love not being out of breath instantly. I used to keep as far away as possible from anything involving exercise while I was smoking because I knew I couldn't do it, but when you quit you actually can! And you can improve and get even better. It's truly a lovely feeling! Sorry about the ranting but I am confident that had I not done these changes at the same time I would still be smoking. 

Stay strong everyone :) And remember that every cigarette not smoked is a victory.

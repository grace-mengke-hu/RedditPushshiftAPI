Smoker for 15+ years. Just finished my first 24 hours smoke free.

Hey all, I have been lurker for a long time on this sub and I have finally given a shot to stop smoking after 15 years of smoking around 10 cigarettes a day.

I haven't felt any craving yet during the first day and I hope I don't feel any craving later too. From what I have heard, first 24 hours are the most crucial one, so I think I have won my first battle today.

Wish me luck! :)

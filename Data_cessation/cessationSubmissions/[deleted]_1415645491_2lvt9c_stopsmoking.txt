Got drunk, had one puff

I was on my 4th day yesterday, going pretty well except when I went outside to have some beers with my friends. Everybody was chain-smoking in front of me but I didn't fail, actually I was quite enjoying how good the beer tasted for once! 
After a few beers and tequilas shot, I asked for 'one puff' to my friend. It tasted terrible and I instantly regretted, I cannot remember If I actually 'smoke' it or if the taste made me cough before I did. It was all really quick anyway and I didn't feel dizzy or different, so I'm not even sure I got some nicotine out of it.

Anyway, today was better and it definitely gets easier. I think I was not ready to go out and drink alcohol yet. Next time, I will not fail.

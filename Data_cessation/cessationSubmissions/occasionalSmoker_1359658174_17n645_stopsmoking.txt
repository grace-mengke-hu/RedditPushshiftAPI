How to prevent myself from fallbacks?

Dear Reddit, I really need your help.

I lived in a happy relationship with my girlfriend. The only problem we have is me occasionally smoking. I used to somke for 4 years and quitted last summer. But sometimes I have a fallback and smoke again. Then my girlfriend figures it out and is sad and dissapointed and has trust issues.

Now I have two problems: I must prevent myself from smoking in the future, not even occasionally and I must convince my girlfriend that she can trust me and I will never smoke again.

If I cannot convice here that I have a strategy how to quit I will loose her.

Can you provide me with tips how to avoid fallbacks and how to formulate these, that she will trust me that my strategy works?

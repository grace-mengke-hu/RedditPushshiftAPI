How Can I Support my Girlfriend

My girlfriend has started having the occasional cigarette again after a year without one. She is a sever asthmatic and struggled quitting for a long time. She didn't tell me but I did catch her having one a week or so ago. 

When I've brought it up in the last week she always says it's not a big deal, and that it's only her that's being affected.

So my question for you. Exsmokers (and smokers). How can I be supportive of her while she quits again?

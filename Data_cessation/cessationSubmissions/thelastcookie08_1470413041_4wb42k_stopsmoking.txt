How did you go from loving smoking to really WANTING to quit?

So I've always heard from ex-smokers that you really have to WANT to quit to be successful. I've been smoking for about 12 years, about 10 a day. I've tried to quit a couple of times but I relapsed. I figured out the reason was that I still loved smoking too much. I wanted to smoke and in my heart I didn't really want to quit. I quit once for a month but failed again for the same reason. I really do want to quit now because I know how bad it is for me but I can't really get to that stage where I start hating cigarettes and really want to quit more than anything else. How did you guys do it? Any tips, stories, suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

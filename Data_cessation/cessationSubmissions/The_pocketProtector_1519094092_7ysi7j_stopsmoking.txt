Went 5 days and relapsed. Not gonna stop me from trying again!

I don't even know what happened. I wasn't feeling any withdrawal but the want for a cigarette was too much.

But it's not over yet! I had 3 tonight and hated them. I want to quit really really badly, and I will try to frequent this forum more often, especially if I ever get any overwhelming wants for cigarettes.

NTAP!!

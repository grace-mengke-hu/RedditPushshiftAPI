One day free and it feels really nice!

My badge is how long I've been trying to quit (tried to change but I'm a bit slow at understanding this stuff).

I had been feeling awful every day I woke up, ciggs weren't even enjoyable anymore they felt like a chore.

I even got pretty fuckin drunk on my day 1 clean, and was able - even while drunk - to resist a cigg.  I have ciggs in the house, and don't need them.  I'm not just quitting because I'm forced to due to circumstance.

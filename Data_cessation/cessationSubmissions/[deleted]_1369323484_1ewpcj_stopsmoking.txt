Question about drinking

I quit almost 11 days ago, cold turkey. I started at age 14, now 29. The past 11 days have been stressful with finding work, being (temporarily) at home with parents, trying to get the house ready to be put up for sale, etc etc. I made it through.

My concern is this coming weekend. I didn't go out last weekend because I knew I'd smoke. After a few drinks, my guard will be down and so will that objective, rational voice in my head that's been getting me through this. (I've read about half of Easy Way, need to finish, I know).

I was thinking about getting an e-cig without nicotine. I wondering if I can 'trick' my drunk self. Am I opening the door to relapse with one of these things? What worked for you in this situation? 

I can't just avoid social situations and friends. It's making me regret quitting (on an emotional, irrational level).

Day 2

It's going well!

Yesterday I made a bad decision to go out for beers, even though I know that I love to smoke while drinking. BUT I didn't smoke!

I think this might be the time that I actually stop, for the first time I feel that my motivation outweighs the discomforts of not smoking. I try to think of the discomforts as mucle soreness after a workout, it's a sign that whatever I'm doing is working!

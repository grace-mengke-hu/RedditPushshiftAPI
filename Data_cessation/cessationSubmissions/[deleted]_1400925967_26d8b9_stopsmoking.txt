Week 1 - I might punch a kitten in a minute

Hey guys! The little app I'm using to track my lack of smoking made it the mission a few days ago to pop onto here and read some things but I figured while I'm here I'll say hi!

Been smoking since I was 15. 10 years of my life. Jesus. What I want to ask as well is, What did you all do when you go cravings? Is there something good for the oral fixation?

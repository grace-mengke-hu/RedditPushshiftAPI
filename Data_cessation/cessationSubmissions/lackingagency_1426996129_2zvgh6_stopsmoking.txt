Today I woke up and really felt the difference.

It's definitely worth it. It's a lightness that's hard to understand, and it's not been apparent at first when I quit smoking. BTW I've been smoke-free for almost 2 month. Nicotine gum is a real deal, guys! And I love the fact, that now it's available at the 7-11..

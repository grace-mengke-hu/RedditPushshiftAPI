3 weeks in, social advice

So I haven't had a smoke in ~3 weeks, I haven't been keeping track of the exact day, I didn't even really plan to stop it just kind of happened because I got sick and then saw how much money I saved while I was bed ridden. My girlfriend has been a big help, stopping the same time as I did and encouraging me not to have one.

Now this might sound strange but I always found smoking as a great social ice breaker. Being at a bar or something and going out for a cigarette was a great way to meet people and strike up a conversation. I find now that I avoid going outside anywhere for a smoke that I just talk to people far less now, at work or when I'm out socialising. In between my job and just going out I would meet 30 to 40 people a week, now since I've stopped smoking its like 5, if even.

Now I've never been shy but approaching people while inside a venue just seems odd to me, I guess because I've never really done it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be there or anything and its just uncomfortable. I've always met people while crammed in a designated smoking area or something like that because it was easy, people having a cigarette are separated from what ever group they came with so there is no like... social boundaries. I would never introduce my self to a whole table or start talking to an entire group of people just because that's awkward as fuck, but while people are having a cigarette none of that exists.

Am I just thinking about this too much? Did any one else have issues like this? It really does seem like flat out boredom its the biggest factor for me to pick smoking back up again and I don't know if that is a normal thing or what?

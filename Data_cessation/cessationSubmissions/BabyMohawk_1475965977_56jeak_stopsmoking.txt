238 days since my last post...

and still going strong, I do get the odd "What's one puff gonna hurt" thought in my head when I catch a whiff of someone who just smoked. Then I think back to this sub and to my flair, and imagining going back to 0, and the thought of going back to 0 really pushes the idea out of my head. So those just starting out on their quit, best of luck, and stay strong! Can't wait to hit one year!

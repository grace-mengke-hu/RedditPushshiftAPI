I needed a day like today :)

After a few really difficult days, I had a very positive experience today. I got laser eye surgery this morning, and anticipating this was stressing me out and giving me horrible cravings. 

I'm thrilled that I didn't cave, because it felt so good not having to ask the doctor how soon until I could have a cigarette! And not having to light up at six in the morning round the corner from the hospital to relieve stress!

Knowing myself, I would have lit up straight out of the procedure, and I would have probably been covering my eyes to smoke all day. Instead, I was actually able to devote all day to letting my body heal... I rested, I had plenty of fluids, I had some nice food... This is the first time in years I actually take care of myself properly

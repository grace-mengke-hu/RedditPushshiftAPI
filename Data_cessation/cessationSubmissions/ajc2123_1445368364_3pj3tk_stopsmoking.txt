Want to help a friend quit. Would like some personal experience.

So I have personally never smoked, but my friend has been trying to quit and I asked if she wanted me to try and help. She thinks it is a good idea. Thing is though, I don't know how hard it is or how it feels.

I guess what I'm looking for is your experiences to help me empathize. Is it easier to quit all together, or slowly decrease how much you smoke.
What is it like when you are trying to quit? 
What is the hardest time and how do you get by them?

Is there anything I can do as a friend or is this something she will have to go through herself? So far I'm only trying to distract her by going out and having a good time doing random things.

I need your help.

I've done it before, only in the last  6 months I've screwed up. I promised myself I wouldn't start again but here I am smoking a pack and a half every two days. The first time was so hard, I quit by making a deal with a buddy that the first person to touch another cigarette would have to pay the other 500 bucks. Well it lasted 12 months and I won but we both started smoking again and I never asked for the money as I figured it was the gesture not the gain.


Every pack I buy is my last and I hate myself so much for it but I feel like I'm doing well when all of a sudden *bam* I've just bought another one. I'm so dramatic when I want to stop but so casual when I buy the next one. What can I do to stop the casual "me" from just buying a pack? All rationale flies out the door.


Sorry you must hear this shit all the time but I hate feeling so weak when I have so many people I need to support. I feel like if I don't have the will to stop something that is killing me how can I give advice to others to be strong? It's making me depressed as I strive for an active and productive life. I want to start running and keeping up with my friends, I want to not feel like an outsider at work.

 Thanks in advance.

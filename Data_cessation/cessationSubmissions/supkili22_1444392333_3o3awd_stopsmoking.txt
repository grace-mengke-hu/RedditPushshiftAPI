Cold turkey starting Monday and I'm terrified.

As it stands right now, I'm at 3 packs a day, except for the last 3 days, where I've successfully cut down to 2ish packs a day. My check just came in and I've quickly allocated all my money out to debts and friends so I only have just enough for food until next paycheck. 

Thing is, I'm terrified of quitting. I've had cigarettes in my pocket for the last 15 years and, on Monday, my most reliable friends will no longer be there. I don't really know what I'm looking for from here. Maybe some words of encouragement or ideas to curb the withdrawals from 3 pack a day smoking?

Thanks and take care.

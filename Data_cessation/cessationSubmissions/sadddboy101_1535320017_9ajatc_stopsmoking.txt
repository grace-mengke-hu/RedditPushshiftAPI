9 days smoke free and going strong!

The first few days were very challenging but I stayed strong and pushed through. I feel great mentally and physically. Still getting cravings but they're not bad at all and less frequent than they used to be. The thought of quitting seemed impossible to me before and now I feel like I could do anything!

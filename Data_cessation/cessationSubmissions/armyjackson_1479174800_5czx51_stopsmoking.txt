Holy crap.. 84 days.. How I honestly feel

Smoker since 14, around nicotine since I was born. 

I'm not as angry as I was.. but there is still this feeling in my bones that I'm missing out on something.  It hasn't gone away and some days it's stronger than others.

I'm currently at the point that I'm not hungry.. but I eat anyway. Also  when I'm actually eating a meal, I never seem to hit that point where my body usually tells me to stop eating. 

Here comes the weight gain.  

I miss smoking, but I just can't do it again.. I've gotten this far.

I've been having a huge craving for the last week or so...

I initially quit at the beginning of the year in hope to get fitter and start playing sports again. But recently I've been getting pretty bad cravings, I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my upcoming exam that I have a bad feeling about it. I still haven't had a smoke in ages and I don't want to start again now. 

I mainly wanted a place to vent myself because I can't really talk to my roommates about this because they have never smoked or believe that quitting is as simple as putting it down. They do help me when i'm drinking though so they aren't that bad.

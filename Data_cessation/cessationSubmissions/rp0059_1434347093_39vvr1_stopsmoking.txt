Saying no to tobacco has been harder than saying no to opiates.

I'm a recovering drug addict November I will have 5 years drug free, quitting smoking has been more difficult for me, even being told that it's killing me still took some serious convincing to finally find the courage to quit. I finally did it and the first day I was so angry it was hell in my head, I had in a way forgotten how horrible it was to fight addiction, I have to remind myself that I am not going to let an addiction control or define me and that I am worth more than the "relief" I think I will get from smoking. Each day has been getting easier, I'm feeling more confident when I have a craving that I will survive it without giving in and every time I survive I am winning and doing what I want to do not what the addiction wants me to do.

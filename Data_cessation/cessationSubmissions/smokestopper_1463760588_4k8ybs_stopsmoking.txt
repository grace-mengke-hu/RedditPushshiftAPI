Scared to stop smoking because cigarettes = good times

Hey guys. I'm a little conflicted. I don't want to stop 100% (that's probably my problem), but I also do not want to smoke as much as I do right now. If someone could give me a button to stop smoking forever I'd have to think about it for a while..

Basically smoking means good times to me. Staying up late and watching tv shows and smoking. Waiting outside for example in a line for a concert or movie and smoking. Having a good meal and then smoking after. Going home after a long day and smoking.

Smoking is associated with good things for me. And honestly I feel like I would not be able to be happy without smoking (I have a history of depression). Some days a cigarette is the only thing I look forward to.

I cannot get up without a cigarette in the mornings. I used to skip classes often (I'm in college) before I started smoking. Now I'm excited once I hear my alarm clock so I can go get a cigarette.

I haven't been smoking for too long, around 2 years now, 15 a day.

Does anyone have any advice? Another question, is it possible to reduce from 15 to 3 a day or something? Or will it get more again? Thank you.

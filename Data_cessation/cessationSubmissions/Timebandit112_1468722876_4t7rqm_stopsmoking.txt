Just smoked my last one... For the thousandth time.

I've been smoking since I was 16 years old. I'm 37 now. That's 21 years that I've been a smoker. I've tried to quit a thousand times. Am in the process of trying again. I don't know how to do anything without smoking. Driving, breaks at work, cup of coffee, calm down after an argument with my wife, relax in general, anything! I smoke a pack and a half a day. My life revolves around smoking. If the family is driving somewhere on vacation we stop every hour or so so dad can have a cigarette. How many hours have they sat in the car waiting on me to smoke. They deserve better  ... I deserve better. So, here it goes.

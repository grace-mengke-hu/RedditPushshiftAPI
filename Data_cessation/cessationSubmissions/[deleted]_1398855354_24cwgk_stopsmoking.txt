I'm quitting dokha cold turkey today.

I've never been too much of a smoker. I cigs smoked on and off through the first 3 years of college. Never really had a problem with it. I was always able to walk away. I recently got into dokha though, and I've been hitting it 5 or 6 times a day, for about 2 months now. My filter got too clogged, so I've been smoking straight for about a week, since I'm too lazy to get a new one. I can already feel it in my lungs. I had a friend take my dokha last night, so I'm committing myself to this. 

Its only been 12 hours or so, but I'm already having a hard time. The rush you get from dokha is so intense and fulfilling, sometimes I really hate the idea of quitting.

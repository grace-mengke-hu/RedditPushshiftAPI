I can't tell any of my friends, but I'm 18:24 cigarette free...

I know that's not impressive, but considering a) that I typically smoke 15-20 a day, and b) that I'm at work, where I typically take a smoke break every hour or so, it's kind of a big deal to me.  
  
My roommate knows, but I'm worried about telling my other friends. They will either give me shit for quitting because they're smokers, or give me shit if I relapse.  
  
So far, other than having no idea what to do with my hands, the combination of a patch, toothpicks, and altoids seems to be going ok. This is the longest I've gone without smoking in about 8 months...

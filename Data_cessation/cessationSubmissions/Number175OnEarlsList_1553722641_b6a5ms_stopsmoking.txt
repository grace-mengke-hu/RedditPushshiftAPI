Medical marijuana users?

Any mmj users on here able to quit smoking cigarettes? I have my mmj recommendation and I currently am vaping the product but I'm not opposed to edibles. They're not 100 percent legal in my state and also I think they're a pain to make. I'm at the point where I HATE the smell of cigarettes so I want to quit but I always smoke a cigarette after I vape. Anyone had any success? Any tips or tricks?

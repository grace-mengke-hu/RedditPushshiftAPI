I'm finally doing it

This is it, guys. I've been smoking for a bit over 2 years, and have made many unsuccessful attempts to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just pulled up a copy of Allen's Carr's book on how to quit smoking, and am very open to any tips and suggestions on how to get through this. Thank you all in advance!

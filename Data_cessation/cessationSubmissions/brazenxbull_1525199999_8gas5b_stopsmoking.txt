7mg nicotine patch usage?

I quit smoking 8 days ago and contacted the state's Quit Smoking organization that have sent me 7mg patches, but being into 8 days smoke free and, even when around my friends that smoke, have zero interest in bumming a smoke. At this point, do 7mg patches make you feel anything? Will the presence of nicotine in my system make me want to start smoking again? Or should I just put it aside?

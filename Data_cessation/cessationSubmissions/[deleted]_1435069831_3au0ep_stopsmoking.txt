36 hours

I've now been smoke free for 36 hours. I stopped because I started to develop a constant cough for the last week or so of my smoking habit. The cough hasn't gone away though! In fact it's so bad that last night I couldn't sleep because of the cough. I'm getting super paranoid that I did some irreparable damage to my lungs....

Is this a normal reaction?
How long does it take for the cough to go away?

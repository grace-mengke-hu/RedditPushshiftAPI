Bad breakup, caved in....

My apologies in advance if I get too personal in this post, but I feel like what has transpired is necessary knowledge for why I smoked again and to figure out how to proceed. To summarize, my girlfriend and I broke up this past Saturday. The past month has been difficult for us, as she's grown distant, depressed, and angry for reasons that have nothing to do with me, and despite my attempts, I could not help. She realized that she was hurting and almost emotionally abusing me, and still cared enough to not want to put me through that anymore. Needless to say, and not helped by my anxiety disorder, I've been taking it quite hard and have fallen away from my cessation. I've smoked around a pack to a pack and a half since Saturday night, and it scares me that it does make me feel more relaxed and in control of my thoughts. How should I go about quitting again and stop myself from becoming addicted like before? Gum worked for me before; should I go back to that?

How can I get my father to quit smoking?

He's 62, and has been smoking since his early 20s. He stopped for a period of 6 years in his 40s, but started up again. He's also diabetic, and not in great shape physically. Smoking will probably kill him within 10 years.

The problem is, he grew up in a country where 70% of his peers smoked. Even today, more than 50% of men his age smoke regularly. There are no laws against smoking indoors, cigarettes are extremely cheap, and the overall culture not only condones smoking, but expects it.

How can I convince him to stop? I've told him countless times how bad it is for his health, but he just doesn't listen.

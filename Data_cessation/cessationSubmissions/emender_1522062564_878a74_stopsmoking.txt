The thought of quitting fills me with actual dread

Is this normal? Id love to not smoke, i think ive had enough, but its been my longest (12 years) and most consistant vice. Quitting ice (which is meth.. but australia style) was easy af compared to when ive tried to quit smokes.

I just joined reddit though and im so excited about finding this, im excited to see if it helps. 

But yeah as the title says, the thought of quitting gives me the same feeling as sticking my head over a really really really tall cliff or something. What is this fear and did you have it and how did you cope?

Much love.

P.s. my aim is as cold turkey as possible.

Drinking buds....

I am just about a month into my quit and i have plans set up with old college friends to go on a road trip. Problem is, they are all smokers! 
I want to be able to enjoy my time with them but remaining smoke free is of the utmost importance. 
Any tips, suggestions? Thank you all for your help throughout this journey

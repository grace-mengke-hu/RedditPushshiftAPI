Bordering on relapse after all this time!

Backstory:

Quit using Champix and a nicotine-free e-cigarette to separate the chemical from the action. Worked, and I kept up with the e-cig until about two months ago when I started having trouble breathing (apparently due to the menthol I was using).

Suddenly after all this time, I've spent the past four or five days thinking a lot about how I miss that feeling in my chest when I take a drag and probably would have already caved if it weren't for the fact that it was the weekend and my non-smoking SO was home with me.

I never had the 'people/fabrics smell bad' phase... I could smell when people came back in from outside, but I liked it. 

I know that it's bad, I know that it's unhealthy... but I also know I'm getting pretty sick of having it chipping away at me. I haven't figured out how to get it to back off, and after this much time I'm starting to wonder if it will.

Sometimes I have to remind myself

that cigarettes don't work  
that cigarettes no longer make me happy  
that cigarettes don't make me who I am  
that cigarettes just make my throat burn, my breathing shallow, and my body and hair smellllllll

that cigarettes were, sure, fun while they lasted - but they've reached their capacity but now they're over and done.


That I'm happier without them  
and that trying would not fix any problems or idea of images  
but only bring me shame.

That whatever I thought they brought out in me  
was just me  
and I'm able to access that without them  
if I wasn't too afraid or nervous to try.

Ugh.  
About seven months down now.

Help me.

28, started smoking around 16. I can't stop. I've tried to "quit" a dozen or so times. I've used the patch/read books/tried stopping cold turkey, etc. Every single time I end up smoking again. It seems the last two or three months are rough in terms of realizing how much I've actually been smoking, and how I hate it yet continue to be addicted. I don't know what to do. 

Expert tips?

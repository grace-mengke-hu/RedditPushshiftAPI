It's a celebration, Bitches!

Two Months! 

If I can give some advice to those of you who are starting out, here it is.

Don't feel sorry for yourself during those first few weeks. It absolutely is a huge challenge to pass those first two weeks, but you just need to remind yourself that your doing this to make a positive change in yourself. Every time you get a craving or experience a huge temptation to smoke again, just wait it out, it won't last more than a minute. AFTER that minute is over, take a deep breath, and look back at how much of a fiend you felt like just then. Those cravings will pass, it's just a matter of time

At two months, I still think about cigarettes every day, but only get an intense craving about once or twice a week. And when that happens, It's laughable how tolerable they are now. They last about five seconds.

I was that guy all my friends would make jokes about when quitting (ahh, he won't last a week, Colin is quitting again? I give him four days, etc.) because I was so addicted to cigarettes. Two months. Two months, bitches. 

Honestly, if I can do it, so can all you who are going through the New-Years resolution quit!

Ask me any more questions you want if necessary, I'm here to help!

Friends that are heavy smokers

Hey guys! 
I have a couple of friends who are heavy smokers, the type that smash through one or two packs a day. Generally when the topic of smoking arises, they give the usual “I’m gonna quit soon”. I don’t like being too intrusive or pushy with the situation, because they themselves realise they need to stop (but cant) and I feel if I bring it up, it’ll just annoy/frustrate them. Are there any ways I can assist? Even in a slow way? 
For the record, I have told them in the past they should quit but I think both ignorance and the addiction clouds their judgement. 
Advice would be appreciated!

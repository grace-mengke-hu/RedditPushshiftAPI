Day 1...again

I quit in January this year and was successfully smoke free for ten months. After six years of more-or-less chain smoking, I was so impressed with myself. But I fell back into the habit after some emotional turmoil and stress and have been smoking for about a month now. I was so upset with myself, but it's made me realize that I'm an addict. And I think being able to call myself an addict has really changed my frame of mind and has allowed me to seek new forms of stress relief and getting help.

I'm in a much better place emotionally right now than I have been for several years, so I'm trying again. I peeled the paper off all my remaining cigarettes and emptied them into the trash can along with my lighters and matchbooks. 

It's so wonderful to see all the support in these threads. Wish me luck and patience!

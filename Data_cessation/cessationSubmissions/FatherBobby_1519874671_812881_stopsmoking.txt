Alan Carr

Smoked ~10 a day since I was 18 (I hate 18y/o me for ever starting). So that's approximately 20 x 365 x 10 deathsticks aka ~Â£36,000, aka a decent % on a deposit on a house not including future medical costs plus increased life insurance premiums


But... I'm signed up to an Alan Carr session on March 16th, wish me luck


If I make progress I'll report back, if not, I'm going back to lurking

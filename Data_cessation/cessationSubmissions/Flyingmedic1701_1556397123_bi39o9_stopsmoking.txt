cravings.

I know there is no magic fix for cravings other than my own will power. But when do the cravings stop being so bad? Ive been 10 days with out smoking now. I still have bad cravings. Cigarettes are the first thing I think about in the morning. I plan to keep going and im trying my hardest not to let myself fail. But having a light at the end of the tunnel would be awesome. I know cravings will always be there. But how long do the intense cravings last?

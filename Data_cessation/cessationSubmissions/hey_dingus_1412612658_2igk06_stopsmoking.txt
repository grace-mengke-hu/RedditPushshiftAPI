I had a weird dream about smoking

So today is day #70 for me after quitting cold turkey. I feel like I'm doing very well with my quit, I seldom have urges, but I'm always able to overcome them.  
  
However, last night I had a strange dream. The details aren't important other than the fact that I had a pack in my pocket, but I was continually bumming them out to others. At one particularly stressful point in the dream, I said that I would meet a friend outside and have a smoke with them. I walked over to where they were smoking, but then stopped myself, and went back inside... Even in my dream I stopped myself from smoking.  
  
When I woke up, I was worried, like that haze of was it just a dream or did it really happen uncertainty. I still haven't smoked, nor do I intend to, but man that was weird. I'm glad my subconscious was still able to resist having a cig.

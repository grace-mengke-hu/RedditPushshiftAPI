Day 26 - cravings worse than ever.

I'm home, and they have subsided, but the walk home from work, which is a big trigger of mine (used to smoke 2 on the 20 mins walk), was at its worst today, and I'm worried that I won't be as mentally strong in the future as I was today.

I've managed this far, and I know now it's just a mental thing. But the thought of experiencing that almost every day scares me.

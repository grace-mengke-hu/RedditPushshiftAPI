Breathing difficulties

I smoked for around two years im now on day three of quitting, im finding it really difficult to breathe, as in I feel if I don't intentionally breathe I just wont breathe at all, in addition im constantly wheezing and coughing.  Was wondering how long I can expect this to last and whether on not I should be seeking medical attention.

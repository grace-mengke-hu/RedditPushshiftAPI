here we goooooooo

switched from cigs to vapes 4 days ago, good transition to break the spell. I ran out of what was left in the pod at mid day yesterday, today's the beginning of a new day and I'm determined to committing to this mother fucker. I hope I do not get major withdraw symptoms at work or anything like that because I have an 8 hour shift today lol.

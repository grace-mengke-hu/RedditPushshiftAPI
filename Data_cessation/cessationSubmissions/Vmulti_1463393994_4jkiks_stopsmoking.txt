Why I'll Never Quit Smoking

It wasn't even the cravings...that didn't bother me. It is because ever since I have been a smoker I've been a deeper, more spiritual, but most of all more self reflective person. After quitting I was way more "go-with-the-flow", instead of taking a calm, objective, and high-minded view of things. Farewell non-smokers, back to my reflection time.

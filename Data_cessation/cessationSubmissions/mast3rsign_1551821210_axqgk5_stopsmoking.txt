Stomach problems

Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I quit smoking 34 days ago (keeping track of everything through my app) with its general ups and downs. However, the biggest hurdle I have right now is that my stomach is cramping up for the last 20 days (still is). I have seen my GP they even checked my stool and everything seems fine but the discomfort is great. 

Anyone on reddit had persistent bowl problems?

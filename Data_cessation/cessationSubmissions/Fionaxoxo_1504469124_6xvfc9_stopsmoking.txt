Hopefully I can post here?

Hello, so I'm not a cig smoker I kicked that habit this time last year after being smoke free for about 2 years previous to that. Anyway I made the change to use an e-cig and I did for 7 months now and I've quit using that, I'm on day 3 and of course the cravings are minimal but they are still there and I swear I'm eating everything in sight.

Wisdom Teeth Extraction and Quitting

Smoker for 6years and just found out that I have to have all four wisdom teeth pulled. Figured this would be the best time to quit. Plan on smoking up until Thursday and be done for good this time. Will power alone enough? Jacked up on pain killers and the thought of not dislodging a clot will be enough to get me through the first 24hrs?

When is the point of no return?

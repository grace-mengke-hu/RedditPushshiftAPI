One more puff... the challenge is (sur)real

I got on a holiday with my wife, non-smoker for 4 months. I don't think about smoking anymore, Just when I smell smokers (I've learned I have a very sensitive smell) , or leaving the airport without the stress of nicotine deprivation on the airplane, mostly positive thoughts. We did some mountain-trails, again a positive experience because I'm not gasping for air anymore, I'm much stronger and less exhausted. All positive, No regrets.

SO......why did I pick up a bud from an ashtray, and smoked it. At night, without my wife knowing. 
It triggered the whole nicotine addiction to live. Next evening I did it again. 4 buds. Stinking, ashtray buds. And I wanted more.

Then I realised. I'm NOT clean. I'm an addict.

I IMMEDIATELY stopped doing this, but my brain was already trying to convince me. "One more bud does not harm." "Remember the kick it gives" "You can stop at any moment"

My full-sense mind could reply to that. "I can stop at any moment? Then stop NOW. Remember the harsh battle you had to get here. You don't want to do this again. Every f*cking day you continue this addict behaviour will make it more difficult.

So I quit. Had a hard time thinking about smoking and cigarettes for a week. Totally, deadly ashamed for my stupid behaviour. 
What helped me through was the promise I made myself that I would not have to reset my counter if i did not take another puff. I wanted to stay a non-smoker. And I did.

The temptation is real. The addiction is real. Don't make my mistake, I was soo close to the edge... Once going down, It's difficult to get back out, it drags you down.

Not one puff ever again.

Trouble breathing after quitting smoking

Hello there guys and gals. I've been smoking for over 12 years, approximately 10-12 cigarettes a day and have quit smoking cigarettes for 54 days now, but I'm completely smoke free for about 25-30 days, since I quit rolling tobacco too.

I quit because I had one tough day when I was not feeling well through the whole day and at one point I had severe arrhythmia, I almost fainted to be honest. Prior to that I had trouble breathing for a few days. That was my wake up call and I just quit. After about a week I started smoking rolling tobacco, but much less than cigarettes, about 3-5 rolls a day. After some time, I had trouble breathing yet again for a few days and then I had my first panic attack during the night. It was horrible to say the least. 

Anyways, I quit rolling tobacco too but to this day, I'm having trouble filing my lungs with air, if you know what I mean and it feels like there is a belt around my chest, too tight... Also some days I feel like there is some sort of clump in my throat, other days I feel nothing.

And I have this weird tingling sensation in my fingers almost every day, drives me nuts...

Can anyone give me some advice? I've been to the doctor few days ago, but I have to do more analysis till the final answer comes, although today I had my lungs x-rayed and the doctor said they are clean, at least that gives me a peace of mind.

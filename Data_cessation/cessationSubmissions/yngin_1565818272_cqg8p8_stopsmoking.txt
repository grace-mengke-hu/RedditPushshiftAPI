Stopped for a week for the first time

This is the first time I’ve gone without smoking for a whole week. I see now the only way I can make this work is if I just fill that time with else and just make it impossible for me to get them. The cravings are strong only two years of smoking but I know it’s easier for me than others. Any suggestions on what to do from here other than just stay busy and avoid it?

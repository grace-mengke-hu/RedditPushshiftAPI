116 hours 52 minutes...

...since my last cigarette. Yes, I started a counter the minute I put my last Cigarette out. Since then, I have been able to taste and smell better. I feel energized. I feel like my voice is clearing up slightly. The cravings come and go, some extremely bad and some extremely mild. But, I keep telling myself that I'm not gonna pay to kill myself anymore. I don't say "I quit smoking", I simply say "I don't smoke" over and over! Why? Cause I am a non-smoker. And anybody can be a non-smoker! If you crave, take a couple deep breaths, and get through it. It usually doesn't last more than 5-10 minutes (for me) then it's over! Really glad I made this choice.

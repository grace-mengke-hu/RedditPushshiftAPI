Hey! I haven’t smoked in 2 days in a couple of ours. Just went cold turkey. My abstinence kicked in today. I’m feeling really low can’t have a conversation without starting to cry, haven’t met someone &amp; haven’t been out from my house since Saturday. Tips on how I stay motivated all tips are welcome.

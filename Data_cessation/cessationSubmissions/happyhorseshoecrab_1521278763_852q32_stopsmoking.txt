Feeling smug...

7 days in cold turkey. i have no idea WHY I quit - I'm 24 and have smoked since 17, so health isn't really a concern. Money? Well, I only smoke rollies, and I get through a 30g pouch in 2 weeks - I'm only spending around Â£250 a year. I decided to quit though... It's been a week. Last night I went out drinking with friends. I sat in the smoking area all night and didn't ask for a cigarette. I wanted one A LOT. But I never gave in. I'm feeling cocky as fuck right now. I read that only 3-10% of people who quit cold turkey make it to the 1-month mark... Game on.

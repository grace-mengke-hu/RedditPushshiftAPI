It's been a week that I've quit smoking ;)

It's quite hard though, specially when you're surrounded by smokers. I didn't want to get any nicotine replacement but I think it might be a good idea. What do you guys think? I tried the gums once and it was really disgusting like I had burning sparkling water.Could you recommend me any good nicotine replacement (apart from gums or patch). 
I feel so much better, I can go up the 4th floor without being out of breath.

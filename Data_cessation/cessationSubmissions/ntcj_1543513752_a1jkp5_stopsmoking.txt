How to stop smoking?

Hi reddit Xd.

So I've been trying to stop smoking since Semptember(I started in August). I had 2 weeks off in September, 1 in Octorber and 2x3days in November. I am a student and I also have a part-time job that sucks(but I need to work cos I need money to get my driving license and then some other stuff..). And there is just too much stress to deal with..I know that Im trying to justify smoking by having a lot of stress but it's been so long that I just can't imagine dealing with it without smoking..So now I'm asking people what helps them to not smoke even if they are under a lot of stress..Any piece of advice is good, thank you.

I want to quit

I’m 17 and I started smoking when I was 14. I managed to stop smoking alone and I’ve been like this for almost 2 years (just socially smoking, that meaning like twice a month) but I’m scared that in December I turn 18 and I’ll be legally able to buy. I’ve had 2 vapes but I ended up selling them because it doesn’t feel the same as a cig, so I decided that I want to quit everything related to nicotine. How do I start?

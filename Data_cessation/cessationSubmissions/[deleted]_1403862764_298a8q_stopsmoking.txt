Day 2 - Post 2 - Balancehighs

Still feeling good, although yesterday I did smoke a cannabis joint that contained tobacco. To some of you this will mean that I haven't stopped smoking at all, and although I appreciate your opinion, not smoking a single cigarette in 36 hours for me is an achievement worth celebrating.

I bought a disposable e-cigarette as I was really feeling the pressure this morning, but now that I've got my patch on, I don't feel the over whelming urge to use it, so that is going to be a bit of a fall back stop smoking aid.

The adventure continues!

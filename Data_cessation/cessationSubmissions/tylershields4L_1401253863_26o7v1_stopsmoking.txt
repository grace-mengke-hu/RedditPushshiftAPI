I'm afraid to lose my mom, my family and I are wanting her to quit.

She's been smoking since she was young, like most older people I know that live around here. She has the worst smokers cough in the world, she gets woken up in the night by it.. She wakes people up by it. She seems sometimes like she has short breath. 

I just don't want to lose her to smoking. I don't know how to go about talking to her or my family talking to her about it. My dad said he's willing to quit if she is. She's a really stubborn person, like I said.. I just don't know how I go about bringing it up seriously.. etc..

One month!

Hey guys! I'm just here to say thanks for the month. Lurking here and the app on my phone are the two things that help me remember how much I don't want to start over. 

That said, I'm over a month in but yesterday was my hardest day yet. A girl I really like did something I really didn't like and I was just fucking MAD all day. I mean mad like I haven't been since high school angsty-ness, and all I could think about was chain smoking and giving some douchebag the business end of my belt... then smoking some more. 

But I didn't smoke (And didn't start a fight). Because I'm a fucking adult and don't need it. I'm paying for my second tattoo with money I've saved from not smoking, and I want that ink more than I want the old destructive life nicotine wants me to have.

I know I sound like a dick but I'm proud of myself for walking away from the whole thing and didn't know who else to tell.

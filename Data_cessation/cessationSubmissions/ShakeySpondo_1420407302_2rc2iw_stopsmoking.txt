Day 2, Want to Punch Roommates in the Face

Pretty much what the title says.  Long time lurker, first Reddit post ever (huzzah).  Anyways, I'm just about 48 hours nicotine free via cold turkey method.  I know there are a billion of these posts on this subreddit already, but I just wanted to vent on here (mostly to keep my hands occupied until this craving passes).

Anyone have any strategies to deal with the barely controlled rage I'm feeling towards everyone and everything?  It's not that they are doing anything specific to piss me off, it's more just the fact that they exist and are occupying the same space as me makes me want to destroy their entire bloodline.

Anyways, this sub is great and has really helped me keep my sanity thus far.  I've got this shit!

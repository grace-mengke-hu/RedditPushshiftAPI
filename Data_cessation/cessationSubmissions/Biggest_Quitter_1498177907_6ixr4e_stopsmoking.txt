Day 0

Today is my first day back here since I stopped smoking...the bad news is that I started smoking again...I'm confident that I will began but I'm nerves as fuck honestly....I'm going through my first breakup at 30 years old....cigarettes can't be the only thing I can turn to relieve the stress of this....any support and kind words would help, thanks!

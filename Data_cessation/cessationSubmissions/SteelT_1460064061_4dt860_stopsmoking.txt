23 Months Smoke Free.

 Nearly two year since I quit a 33 year, 2-3 packs a day habit.

I had my yearly physical 2 weeks ago and my lungs and heart are great.

 Lately, I've been having strong urges to take a hit or two from a cigarette. Maybe because I'm dwelling on my two years and it's making me think about all the smoking I used to do and kind of miss the feeling of the smoke hitting the back of my throat and filling my lungs. The relaxation as the nicotine travels throughout my body. Hopefully the urges will stop when next month finally gets here.

 Until then, I'll simply continue not to smoke. 

 For you new nonsmokers, stay strong. I'm proof that you can quit and I'm proof that you can fight the urges to smoke.

 Picking up another cigarette does much more harm than good. Why waste a 1 week, 10 day, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year track record?

 Ever taking a drag off another person's cigarette will lead to:

"That wasn't bad, I can handle a cigarette once in a while"

 "A couple cigarettes a day isn't really smoking compared to what I used to do"

 "Why the hell did I quit smoking? I love smoking"

 "I really need to quit again. Why did I start smoking again?"

 Good luck to all.

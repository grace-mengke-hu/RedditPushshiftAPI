1 day down - anticipating a rough week ahead

Hey everyone. First of all, thanks for creating this community because it has really motivated me to quit smoking. I had to actually get myself to WANT to quit smoking which was the hardest thing to do, but it's just been too long (7 years). I had gotten down from about a pack a day to between 1-4 a day. But yesterday when i ran out i just pulled the plug and decided that was it. It's been about 36hrs now and I can honestly say I'm craving a cigarette pretty badly. It's so habitual and everytime i step outside i catch myself reaching into my pocket out of habit.

I'm guessing it's going to be a rough week or so, but any advice you guys have would be really beneficial, you've helped enough already by just existing.

Edit: Update  - 3 days. Really intense cravings. I've worked out 2-3 times the past 2 days. Ran 10 miles. I also never realized how spicy the Chinese food I eat is. Food is totally different. Amazing.

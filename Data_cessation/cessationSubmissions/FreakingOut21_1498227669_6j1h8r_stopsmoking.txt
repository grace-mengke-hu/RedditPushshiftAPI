Is there something wrong with my heart?

I'm 25 and I have been smoking on and off since I was 15. Sometimes after smoking a lot if I were out, the next day, sometimes the next day I'd get a sudden shortness of breath. I went to my doctor he said it was probably smoking too much. He listened to my chest and did a chest xray. All was fine . That was two years ago


I quit smoking for one year and I exercised and never had an issue. 6 months ago I started smoking again and the sudden shortness of breath happened twice  I quit again yday 


I have no chest pain etc but someone told me it's probably my heart causing this due to an irregular heartbeat so I've been freaking out since. What do you guys think? Anyone else had similar experience?

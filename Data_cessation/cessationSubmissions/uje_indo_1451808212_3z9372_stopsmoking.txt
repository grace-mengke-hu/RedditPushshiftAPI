brain is f*cked up

These last two days, suddenly i got strucked by cigarettes pyshcology attacks, kind of miss it a lot lately. Last night i dream about it, i smoke a lot with somebody play saxophone across the street where i was, very beautiful scene i'd say. Then suddenly, i woke up and feel strange at the same time, it feels like after one hour my friend of friend come and we talks a lot about cigarette craving and how it does not hurt him anymore because he just smoke 2-3 cigarettes per day. Then i took one of his because he left them on the table when he went to the toilet, just want to keep it at that time. Then he went home, but i got 1 cig. Then i smoke it while going outside, it was mixed feeling, between weird,enjoyment,failure, etc... My head feels dizzy, and bum!!, get hit by car then wake up on my bed. it was false awakening, dream within a dream a.k.a i play inception with my version. fiuuhh..

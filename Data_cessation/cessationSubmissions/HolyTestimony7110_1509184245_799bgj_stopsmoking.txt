Day 3..... attempt #2.

I'm the only one in my household whose quitting and my spouse has agreed to not smoke in the house or the car.  I just started a new job, where I can't smoke.  Unless I wanna smoke IN a huge dumpster!  No thank you.   But it's the little things that add up that make me realize why I smoked in the first place.   I always thought of cigarettes as a friend of mine.  Little did I know that it would be the object that killed my mother.  I HAVE to quit. I'm scared as he|| I'm going to revert.

2 Weeks in. I can't actually believe that I've managed to do it.

Feeling euphoric right now. I worked out that I've actually saved myself Â£60 in just 2 weeks, it's strange how you don't think about the large amount money you pay just to slowly kill yourself.

I don't think I could have done it without the motivation that reading this subreddit gives me, so a BIG thank you!. The badge is an ingenious idea also and is definitely my visual aid. So to those who still smoke and are thinking about quitting...join me in not smoking today, it gets so much easier.

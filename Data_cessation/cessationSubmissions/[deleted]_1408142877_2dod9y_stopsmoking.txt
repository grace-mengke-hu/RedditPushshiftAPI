Tips for keeping my cigar smoking a very occasional habit?

Not sure if this is the right subreddit. I like cigars for the taste, and I enjoy trying different brands and flavours. However I feel myself getting a bit hooked. I was thinking of writing a date a month or two away on my packs when I buy them to make sure I'm only having two or three a week. Other than that what else would you guys recommend? If it starts to be a big problem I'm going to force myself to quit all together but as of right now I'm just trying to be cautious that I don't get hooked.

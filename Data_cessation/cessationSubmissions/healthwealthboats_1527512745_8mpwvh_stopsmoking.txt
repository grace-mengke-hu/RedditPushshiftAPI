Was vaping first thing in the morning until right before bed

We all know cigarettes are cancer causing agents of death but I convinced myself vaping wasn't that bad.  Got myself more addicted to the delicious fruity flavors of the vape far more then I ever was to cigarettes.  What was supposed to be an alternative was overtaking me.  Please don't let this happen to you.  11 days not being chained to carrying that damn thing with me.  Good luck gang.

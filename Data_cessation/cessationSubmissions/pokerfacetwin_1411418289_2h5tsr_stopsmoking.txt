I wish I had quit a long time ago.

Think about that statement. 

Or "*I wish I had quit sooner*".

I know I think about that often, and I have heard it on this sub many times from those of us here at or near the end of this ridiculous addiction.

The message here is to those still smoking or trying to quit and having a hard time of it. That message is that you too will get to that point where you no longer think about smoking or cravings or  behavior.

You will think about how you long you did smoke, how it was far too long, and that you wish you had quit sooner.

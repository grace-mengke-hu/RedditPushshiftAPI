Dreams of smoking

I always heard from people who quit smoking years ago that even after all these years they have dreams about smoking. My uncle, who quit 15 years ago, used to say: aaah I still dream about smoking, there is nothing better than a cigarette...

It's my 22nd day today since I quit and I had dreams of smoking 2 or 3 times. 

But they were far from enjoying the cigarette. 

Every time it was the same, I realized I smoked a cigarette when I was already done with it or almost done with it. At the very moment of realization I went ballistic. I threw it away and started panicking why the hell would I smoke a cigarette when I wasn't a smoker. I didn't want to smoke it, hell I never got to enjoy it either since when I realized I'm smoking it was already gone.

When I try to analyze the dream, I think it's good. Cause my subconscious mind is telling me I don't want to smoke it. 

I would always prefer this dream over my uncle's version.

Any of you experience similar dreams after quitting?

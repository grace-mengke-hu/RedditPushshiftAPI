Day 1 was surprisingly easy

I don't know if it's because I've quit for 6 months before or my positive mental attitude that's making this so easy. The cravings and hot flashes are annoying but they don't last. I haven't needed to resort to using my electronic cigarette (no nicotine) yet! I can do this!

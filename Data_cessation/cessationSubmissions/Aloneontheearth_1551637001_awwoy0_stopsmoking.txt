It has been a week!

I started smoking when I was 14, quit when I was 18 and picked it back up last year. I smoked about 5-8 cigarettes a day and then switched to a Juul. I have been free of the Juul for a week and I feel so much better than I did before! I am sleeping better and am less agitated. I don't get angry at my partner for no reason and I am generally happier. I will keep this going! I know I can and know that there are no benefits to smoking or vaping. I wish you all the best of luck on your quitting journeys.

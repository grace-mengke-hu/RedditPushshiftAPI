Afraid of consequences of smoking

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have concerns and wanted to ask for your opinions on this. I'm trying to quit smoking. It's difficult, and everytime I give in I immediately get shortness of breath after one cig. This shortness of breath hasn't gone away even when I quit for a few days. Is it possible for me to have developed some kind of permanent lung damage from smoking for 7 years, of which I smoked a whole pack of 22 cigarettes for 4 years? I'm in my early twenties. I'm afraid of having permanent damage.. the thought horrifies me. Thanks for everyone taking the time to read this/respond.

(Btw, sorry if I made grammar mistakes, my English is ok but not very good)

Tonight is my last one before going to bed...as always.

Maybe I'll start differently this time,by having people giving in...I've wanted to quit since a while.Every pack is my last,every smoke is a nightmare...I really want to stop killing myself.I once was a healthy man...now I can't even breath proudly...my voice has change...Fuck theses sticks!

I don't even know what to say....I've once quit cold turkey for 6 months....was feeling good like I've never did.(Smoking since early teenage years...never felt what my real body was capable of)
Only one puff and it's gone down...all these efforts...that now I realise since I want to stop again.

Feels like I'm only thinking about this drug...before and after doing something...maybe vape,or patch would help...don't wanna be additcted to anything else...tomorrow is the day...as I always tell me and sleep on...IT'S A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

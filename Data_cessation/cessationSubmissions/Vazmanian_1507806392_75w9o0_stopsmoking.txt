I have quit smoking for 12 hours, anyone else at a similar stage of quitting or remember how they dealt with it?

Been smoking maybe 15 cigarettes a day for 2 years, started when I was maybe 14 then had been on and off until 17 where I began smoking full time. 
12 hours ago last night I had my last cigarette,  I'm now anxious, edgy, angry, demotivated and obviously CRAVING a smoke. How do you deal with it ? How do I take my mind off it

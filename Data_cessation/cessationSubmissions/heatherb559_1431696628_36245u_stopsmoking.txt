Feeling like a winner damnit

31 days since I took that patch off. I'm free now! This is my last day at my old job. Start my new one on Monday. My quitting has inspired my sister and daughter to quit as well. I feel 1000 times healthier. My confidence is thru the roof.  This is the best decision I've ever made. Thank all you folks here for the mad support you give. I would not have made it this far without you.

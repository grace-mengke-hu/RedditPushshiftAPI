Holy crap I think I did it....

I'm gonna preface this by saying my personal goal was to quit smoking cigarettes, in order to save money, and to not smoke when my best friend who has cancer comes up for a visit in May. I refuse to smoke around her. Her lungs are bad enough. Not for my own health,  or any other reasons. Simply to save money. So for those of you who consider vaping as "cheating", this post isn't for you. I still use nicotine and I'm personally fine with that choice.

*HOLY SHIT GUYS I THINK I DID IT.*

Last week I decided to buy a starter vape just because I was sick of "slipping" and buying smokes. I was sick of the extreme anxiety spikes, the jitters, the sweating and the irrational anger from not having anything in my system. I was just done.

I think this vape finally has helped me quit for the long run. Yesterday I bummed a smoke from a friend of mine just to test the waters and EW. Good lord I don't know how we even fell into smoking in the first place! How was that even appealing?!

I bought two juices with 3mg of nicotine each (the lowest I could find that still had nicotine) and it's been so much easier on the cravings....don't get me wrong, I can be in the middle of vaping and (for some reason) I still wish it was a cigarette, or I'll eat a meal then remember "oh yeah I don't have any smokes.." and it's not a fun feeling, but for once, I'm actually in a positive mindset that this will work!!

To Anybody that vapes, has it helped? Did you slip, how long until you didn't think about cigarettes and just went to your vape without a second thought?

To everyone else:....how do I reset my quit counter? It's....way off lol

First day of the rest of my life

Hey everyone, 

I've been a lurker on this sub for a while now. I've been thinking of quitting for what feels like years but finally decided to take things in my own hands. I've finished reading EASYWAY and I've just now vowed that I will never smoke again. I feel free, determined and a little sorry I didn't read it earlier, but I'm mostly ecstatic I'm finally fighting back against the disease.

I know some of you have successfully quit and are happier now than you've ever been. For the rest of you, keep at it! Stay motivated, stay positive. It only gets better from here.

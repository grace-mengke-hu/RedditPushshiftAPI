2 weeks, spitting black matter out of my lungs

It's been 2 weeks, didn't have any cravings since 3-4 days ! even when stressful situations :)


I began to purge my lungs yesterday, it hurts  a little, i feel blocked inside, but what a relief to see all that black thing coming out of me !

i think the 2 weeks checkpoint is the most decisive. i don't feel any addiction anymore !

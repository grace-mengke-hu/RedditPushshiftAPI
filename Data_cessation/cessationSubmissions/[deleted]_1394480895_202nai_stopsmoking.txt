How can I help my 16yo brother quit smoking?

He's only started very recently and obviously my parents aren't happy at all. I caught him smoking tonight when he was waking to meet his friends. I would like to stop it before he actually becomes addicted if I can.

Most of his friends smoke so thats probably what started it.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks.

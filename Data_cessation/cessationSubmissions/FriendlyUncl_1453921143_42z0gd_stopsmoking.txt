22hrs into not smoking

Put out my last smoke 22hrs ago, right after lunch or so.

I figured right after lunch, I'd have enough to get me through the evening at home but I was wrong. The last time I 'quit' was after I had major surgery, the pain medication they gave me was so powerful I just never had the urge to smoke.

As soon as that dried up and I was sitting at home playing games and recovering some what normally I got that little nagging feeling in the back of my mind. 'Know what would be great right now while we fly space ships, a smoke' I caved, bought a pack and was back on it.

My question for you guys is how do you get through that first few days especially doing activities you normally did while smoking? For me when I'm driving for more than 30 minutes or at home playing games, thats when I smoke and thats when it usually hits the hardest.

I'd hate to have to avoid gaming all together, and driving I can't avoid with my job. A friend said he got some really strong mints and he would use those, kind of inhale with them in his mouth as if he were taking a drag. He also mentioned that he held onto his last pack and just kept them nearby and that it was sort of a comfort. 'They are there, but I don't need it right now.'

I really want to quit this time, my girlfriend is really worried about my health. My surgery was for a collapsed lung, spontaneous primary pneumothorax, the doctor was straight with me from what I can tell and told me it was sort of a genetic defect, blebs or sacs on the outside of my lung that burst but that smoking was what made it difficult to get my lung to heal.

Sorry for the long winded rant, the nagging has just picked up a bit. I got done spending 20 minutes sitting my car telling myself I didn't need to run to the store to get a pack before coming in here to see what the internet said.

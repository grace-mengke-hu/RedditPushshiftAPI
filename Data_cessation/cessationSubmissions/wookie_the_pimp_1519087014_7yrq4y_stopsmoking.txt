Quit 6 days ago, but my spouse has not. I am so tempted to grab one of hers, but it is so dang tempting. How can I stay strong since I know I can't "make" her quit until she is ready?

Like the title says, I quit on February 13, because I know how bad this is for me.  I had a stroke over two years ago (I'm mostly fine now) and I know that I do not want to go through that ever again.  But, my wife has not quit and has no desire to right now.  She states she likes it, which I completely understand.

I have two questions for you all.

1) How do you stay strong when another household member still smokes?

2) Knowing that I can not force her to quit, what can I do, in the form of positive encouragement, for her to want to?

I don't want to put a rift in our relationship. I see the benefits of quitting and it just pains me to see her still smoking, knowing that she has some of the same risk factors that I did before my stroke.

Thanks fellow non-smoking Redditors.

20 Years Old and I want to quit now before it's too late

Hi guys, I don't know how much of a response this post will generate, but even 1 response would help me very much. 

I'm 20 years old studying in college and I've been smoking a pack a week since I was 19. The first time I ever lit a cigarette I was 15 years old. My father was a smoker, so over time it made me curious. It wasn't until I got into college that I picked up smoking a lot more. I was surrounded by a not-so-great group of people who encouraged my smoking behavior. Just recently I've been feeling a yearning to quit and thinking about past events that led me to the thought of quitting. One of them was my grandmother dying. She always made a point to make sure I didn't end up a smoker or drinker like my dad and his brothers, she took care of me as a young kid and I saw her as a mother. It was only fair that I took care of her as she was dying. I'll never forget her telling me to not do those things because she knew I'd regret them, and here I am totally regretting them and I feel like I've let her down. Another event was my father actually talking about his death to me. 

One day my father showed up to the house with a Mercedes- Benz saying he wanted to spend his money before it was "too late". Then he started tearing up and telling me he also wanted to leave behind something nice for me, and said sometimes when he's sleeping he feels like his heart stops and that he thinks he'll die soon. That was a strange day that day. It didn't stop me from smoking, but it has made me hate and loath myself more for partaking in the behavior. 

I just want to know how I can quit? I just want to lead a normal life, I don't want to be trapped. I have so many things stressing me out, and my nicotine stress gets aggravated by it. I have one pack I bought today and was wondering if I can use that as a weening- off pack? Is it possible to ween-off and quit cigarettes in such a manner? Please, let me know.

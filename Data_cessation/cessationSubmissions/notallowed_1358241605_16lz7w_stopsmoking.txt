Here we go then...

I had a hypnotherapy session last night. Very dubious about it as I haven't stopped thinking about smoking but as I've done it, it's a good enough reason to give quitting a chance. I'm 32 and have smoked since I was 15 and only managed to quit for 3 months in that period. I hope that this is it but for some reason I have this fear in the back of my mind that it isn't. Wish me luck!

Reaffirming my commitment to not smoking

(I am mainly writing this for accountability purposes)

For the last couple of weeks, my commitment to not smoking started to wane a bit. I haven't bought a pack since I quit in november, but I have bummed some cigarettes from friends and strangers the last few weeks. 
This ends today. I am again fully commited to not smoking. I don't want to be addicted to nicotine again, and I don't want to go through the horrible withdrawal every again. 

To other people who have 'cheated' and smoked the occasional cigarette: don't feel defeated. Realise that quitting nicotine is something that requires a long-term effort. Don't think you can handle every temptation after three months. Be careful when drinking alcohol. Keep using the little tricks that helped you in those first weeks (gum, candy, toothpicks, keep reading this subreddit)

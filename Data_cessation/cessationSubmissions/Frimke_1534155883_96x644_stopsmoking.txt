Didnt smoke for 13 days but did I quit?

Today is my 13th day of quiting smoking cigarettes. It has been rough but not undoable. Ive had craving bad nights of sleep and days of feeling sick and stressed but I managed to get through them without even on puff. 
The last pack that I bought is still in my drawer together with 23 lighters. My roommate still smokes in my house, all my collegues smoke around me and I spent my nights going out still outside with all my smoking friends. And it doesn't bother me at all, actually I might even enjoy it. Now this made me wonder did I actually quit..?

Tomorrow will be 20

I'm waiting for bedtime so I can wake and say it's been 20 days.ðŸ˜Š As of right now it's been my check better than the last post. Not so much crying. I do get alittle lonely when my boyfriend spends a lot of time outside smoking and playing on his phone,but I just tell myself no and spend the time with our son. He will make the choice when and if he wants to. I cannot be mad with him when I know what it's like. 
 Sorry that turned more into a rant than I wanted . This post really is more about the good side of all of this. Alot  less craving and more planning for the future without cigarettes. For the first time out of all the times I have tried to stop I can finally say I don't want to fail . I don't want a smoke and I don't want to be that person any more.
 So . Learning yoga and meditation is on my future tasks.  Thanks for the help everyone so far. It really does mean so much just to hear from all of you who have done this. Gives me hope .

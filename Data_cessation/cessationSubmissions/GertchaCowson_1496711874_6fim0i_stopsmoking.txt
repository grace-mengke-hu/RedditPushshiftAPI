I stopped biting my nails

I gave up smoking last week (Cold, Miserable, Turkey) and have been feeling anxious pretty much the whole time. However, I have stopped biting my nails - which would lead me to believe I am **less** anxious than I was before, at least as physical symptoms go. Sharing this just to see if it's just me.

I did it

After 2 fucking horrible weeks of hell and telling nobody about my existence. I did it. I can proudly show my face without a ciggy in my hand and say I finally got rid of this demonic curse. I'm finally free and I feel reborn. I can't wait to see my family again. I'm honestly running out of words. I'm never starting again

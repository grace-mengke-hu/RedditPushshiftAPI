Intense cravings out of nowhere. Good thing I threw out all of my vaping equipment.

As my flair says, I quit vaping and nicotine about 140 days ago, and I feel a lot better. My anxiety is not nearly as bad as it was before, I can finally sleep at night, and I no longer give an insane amount of money to satisfy an addiction. I did it mostly thanks to Allen Carr but also quite a bit of willpower since the physical withdrawal symptoms are very **very** real, despite what his book claims.

However, just yesterday, I began to get this intense feeling of nicotine hunger out of nowhere. It felt exaclty like the cravings I had in my first couple of weeks of quitting. I stay hydrated, try to get my mind occupied but it has been 24 hours and this subtle feeling hasn't stopped. I read somehwere that the most intense cravings for most people are on the third day, third week, third month and third year after quitting. I guess it is just a normal part of nic addiction recovery, who knows.

Honestly, if I still had my vape pen, I would have taken a couple of puffs and then be back to square zero. So glad I threw it out.

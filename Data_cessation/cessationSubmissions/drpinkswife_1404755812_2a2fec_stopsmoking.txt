The Little Voices

Picture them if you will, one on each shoulder, whispering in my ear:

A: Brilliant day! No cravings! Went for that walk...didn't even focus on any smokers! Oh there was that one dude...but he looked pretty dishevelled ...so I didn't envy his cigarette. Lovely energy. Got to were I was going early because I felt like almost running, I had so much energy. I can do this!!

B: The real problem was you switched from the organic smokes to the ones with all the crap in them. You could just have one additive free one...

A: Fuck you and go away!

B: But you never got to have that last smoke! Poor you! It's not fair. You may as well have it now and start over tomorrow. ;)

A: This is why we don't have cigarettes in the house! Cause B can't be trusted to get on board with what we are trying to do here and we must remain vigilant! We wish B would shut up for good. Sneaky fucking B.

And that is the inside of my brain....Sound familiar?!

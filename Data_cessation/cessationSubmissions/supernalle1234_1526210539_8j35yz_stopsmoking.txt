TOTALLY exhausted (sleepy)... 40 days in

The last few weeks I've been mentally exhausted and sleepy more or less every single day.

I mean, I sleep for 7\-8 hours and I am ready to go back to sleep an hour after I wake up. I take a hour\-or\-so long nap when I'm home in the weekends, but I don't feel refreshed the least when I wake up from that either.

My body is not fatigued and I have no problems when I go out with my dogs or ride my bike and so on.. It's just a really tough mental exhaustion. I was a little tired before I quit as well I guess, I have 2 small children so they take a lot of my energy as well.

Any suggestions?

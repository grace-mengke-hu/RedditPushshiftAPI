Nicorette quickmist mouth spray?

What is everyones thoughts on the nicorette quickmist mouth spray? 

I've tried the gum which I didn't like because i felt it provided no relief whatsoever, the lozenges were much better than the gum, i used to own a decent vape and that was by far the best nicotine replacement however it was very easy slipping back into smoking because where I am nicotine liquid is illegal to sell and if you run out and can't wait a few days for overseas shipping...back to cigs. 

however i recently got the quickmist mouth spray and the shit actually works. Haven't craved a cigarette all day, it burns like the hell but you eventually get used to it. its very convenient and provides instant relief rather than longer drawn out relief that the gum and lozenges do. anyone else have success with the quickmist mouth spray?

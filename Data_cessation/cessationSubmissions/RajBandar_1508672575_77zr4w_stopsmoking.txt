It’s been a crazy 2 weeks...

Looking back I’d be lying if I said it was all plain sailing but it does get noticeably easier every day. I’ve had some moments of despair, some of blind ( and fortunately controlled) rage but mostly it’s all been beneficial. The cravings are still there but the little bastards are getting weaker every time. I’m now at the stage where I suddenly realise I’ve gone two, three or even four hours without thinking about smoking-and when I do it doesn’t matter because I’ve removed the option of lighting  up a fag from my brain. You can all do this, every day is a new joy now. Also, no matter how you plan on quitting I’d urge *everyone* to read Allen Carr’s *’Easyway To Stop Smoking’* It’s safe to say that book has changed and probably saved my life.

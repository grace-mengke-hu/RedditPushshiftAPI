One month three days!

Quit smoking one month and three days ago. I've yet to get to the point that I'm HAPPY that I quit. I'm still salty I suppose. I don't feel any better, I was always a light smoker (around three cigarettes per day).


However, I do like that I no longer smell like cigarettes (had no idea how awful it was).


Anyway! Experienced quitters, when do you become **GLAD** you quit??

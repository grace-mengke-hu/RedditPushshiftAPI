LET'S NOT SMOKE TODAY! 5 days, 21 hours, second working week and is not easy! /Rant /Cursing

I stopped to smoke mid week (last week)
I usually smoke a TON while working in my desk office (is completely legal and allowed and nobody cares, literally nobody cares).

The habit is too strong, I want SO MUCH a cigarette but I look to my app, I see how my health has improved, right now I remember how in the morning I smelled things differently at home (dog and cat smell was so strong).

I have here 3 packs, all kind of half empty... I was on skype with a client and usually I would sit and light a cigarette, my hands on the keyboard and mouse and cigarette in my mouth...

So I did something weird, I grabbed a cigarette and literally chewed the shit out of the filter... inhaled it, smelled it, and for at least 30 minutes I had it in my mouth... it's still here, all wet lol, and now I put it back and it just taste bad.. the taste that comes from inhaling the tobaco that is inside is disgusting... but somehow it helps... Yeah I probably should go buy a GUM right now...

the more I write the more I'm sure I wont smoke now... the problem is that the office triggers me to smoke all the time, every-time, anytime... When I change to a new excel sheet, or talk to a new supplier, or get up to do a different task, it seems that that's the reason I usually start a cigarette, when I'm moving from one task to the other...

Chewing gum has helped, probably I need to go buy one right now.

But my working efficiency has surely declined... God for fuck sake i just need to stay focus... 

LET'S NOT SMOKE TODAY! One minute at a time, one hour at a time, one day at a time... I'm going to fucking get out of this week without smoking at the office... god damn Monday, I hate it. 

Besides, it's not even the nicotine ! It's all in my head now... according to the app at least.

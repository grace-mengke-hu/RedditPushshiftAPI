Today will be a week since I smoked my last cigarette.

Hey! I've been a heavy smoker for 20 years.  The past 10  years I've been smoking 2 packs a day.  I've tried to quit twice ... first time I lasted 36 hours.  Second time lasted 12 hours.  This is my third attempt and I've been smoke free for a week now.  What changed this time? I met a one of a kind guy. First two dates I didn't tell him I smoked... At the end of our second date we kissed.  Came home, smoked my last 7 cigarettes in a row and vowed to quit.  He didn't ask me to quit... he didn't even know, but he doesn't deserve a stinky and filthy smoker of a girl.  Hope this is my last attempt to quit.

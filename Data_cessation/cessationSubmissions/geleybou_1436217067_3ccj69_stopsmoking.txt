It's been a week (First Post)

I've tried several times almost half-heartedly to quit smoking, but now that I've been smoking for 7 years, I am really starting to see some of the effects on my health.  I'm scared how much dental and respiratory damage is irreversible, and I want to have a long healthy life.  I'm in my mid-20's and I feel like if I can kick the habit now, I will still have much of my life left to fully and healthily enjoy. 

I "quit" almost 2 weeks ago, but then had some drinks and smoked one cigarette last Monday.  Afterwards, I felt awful about myself and my lack of willpower.  

I'm really quitting this time.

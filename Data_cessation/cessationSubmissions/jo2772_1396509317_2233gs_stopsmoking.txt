Quitting for good (I hope my willpower don't let me down)

Today is day 5 and I'm finding it surprisingly easy, my partner isn't really encouraging me I thought he would as he's doesn't smoke, but perhaps I'm encouraging him to cut down on his drinking since I've stopped smoking but perhaps he doesn't want me to stop smoking as he's doesn't want to stop drinking......but I'm stopping and I'm going to try really hard to quit this time. Any suggestions guys to keep on the right path????  😁 💜

I can safely say I QUIT! I'm free

Hello Reddit. 
My name is Doru and I am 17 years old. I started smoking hard core around 16 months ago, I used to smoke just on occasion (parties) before I became addicted. Just 15 days ago I took the best decision I took in years. I said enough is enough. No more wasted money, no more regrets, no more screwing up my health. Cold turkey, no beating around the bush, no bullshit. I just thought about all the benefits of not smoking and that was enough to help me kick the stupid habbit. I used to smoke like 2 packs a week, sometimes even more! It's horrible, it made me feel like a weak person. There's literally no benefits smoking, so why do IT? WHY? Smoking tobacco is the most retarded stuff I've done in my life. Even while I was smoking I still thought it's horrible, but I was just hooked and couldn't stop. I never ever want to smoke in my whole life. I can safely say I quit, just last night I had my final test, that was getting drunk and not smoking.  I am free, at the age of 17! I fucking did it, so can you! 

Many thanks to this subreddit, it helped a lot and many thanks to the people that supported me!

My job is done here.

I'm out!

Down to my pre-quitting weight

I put on about 15 lbs in 2 months after I quit.  I spent another month dieting and exercising, but staying at the same weight.  A month ago, the scale began to budge and now I'm 2 lbs lighter than I was when I was a smoker.   

If you put on weight when you quit, don't get discouraged!  If you're disciplined enough to quit, you'll be disciplined enough to lose the weight.

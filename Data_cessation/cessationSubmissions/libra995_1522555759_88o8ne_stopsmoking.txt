Recently quit/advice.

I’m 22, started smoking when I was 16. I’ve decided that the cigarette I’ve recently had was my last. I’ve tried to quit three times so far, never made it past day four. I’m determined that this time will stick even though it’s something that I know will be difficult for me. Is there any advice this community is willing to offer so that I can continue to check back and hopefully make cravings a little bit easier. I’m mainly quitting because of my health and, if I’m being honest, I don’t like that it ages you. I want to stop before that starts to noticeably happen. I know my skin doesn’t look as healthy as it should because of smoking. Does anyone have before and after pictures that show the difference not smoking has made. Also, in the spirit of being vain, and honest. I’m nervous about weight gain. I’m a good size now and would be comfortable putting on a little more weight if it came to it but I would like to avoid it. Does anyone have advice on how to ensure that doesn’t happen, or at least to lessen the blow. Thanks a lot.

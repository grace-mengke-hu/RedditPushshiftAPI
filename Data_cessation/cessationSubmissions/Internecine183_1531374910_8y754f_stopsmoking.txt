Made it almost a year and I "fell off the wagon"

August would have been a year since I quit smoking. I quit my job recently and because of that, my anxiety and depression have really kicked it up a notch. After one especially hard day, I bummed a smoke and since then, I've had about one smoke a day. I bought my first pack today since I quit and I'm really disappointed in myself. I really dont want to go back to smoking again but the cravings are really strong, especially when I drink. I'm so bummed out about this. I could honestly use some words of encouragement...

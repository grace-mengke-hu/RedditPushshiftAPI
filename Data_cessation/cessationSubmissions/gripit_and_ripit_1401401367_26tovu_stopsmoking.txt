Chantix side effects?

I've been taking Chantix since May 12. My stop day was May 19, and I have been a non-smoker since that day. I follow the dosages and directions to a T, but I still experience severe nausea about 20-30 minutes after taking it. It doesn't matter when I eat (before or after I take the med), and drinking a glass of water with it has no affect on the nausea. Anyone else experience this with Chantix? How'd you overcome it? I want to take the entire month before I quit taking it, but I HATE the nauseous feeling I get from it.

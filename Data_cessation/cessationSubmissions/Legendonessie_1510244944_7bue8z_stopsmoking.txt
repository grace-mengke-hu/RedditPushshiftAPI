Tips to quit

I'm 18 and have been smoking for 3 years. I freak out when I don't have a cigarette but if I have one I can go a while without smoking. It's like a control things. Any tips on quitting?
Edit: I started to smoke to cope with depression, I'm on medication now.
At lunch during high school I go to smoke, don't enjoy the lunchroom any advice with that too

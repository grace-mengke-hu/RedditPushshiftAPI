My wife and I are planning to quit this Friday. Any advice?

Well, we tried to quit back in June together, and between our combined weaknesses and a slew of calamities we didn't last more than a couple of days. We're planning to quit this Friday and take the weekend to suffer through the first dreaded 72 hours. 

Any advice from people who may have quit with a significant other would be awesome. If not, really just looking for help and encouragement. I've been smoking for 11 years. I want to be a non-smoker now but I'm still dreading the quitting process. 

Thanks Reddit.

Starting at 0

So I had to remove my badge a few months back, I'm starting at day 0 again.  I've come up with a list of reasons that I want to quit, but I'm interested in others.  We all want to quit for the usual benefits:
*Longer lifespan
*More energy
*Higher quality of life
*Don't smell as bad

But what are the reasons you want to quit that are just plain weird?  I've found a few of my own:
*I can remember dreams and old memories better
*I concentrate on schoolwork more and don't get distracted easily
*My teeth ache when I've had too many cigarettes

These are just a few, anyone else have any weird things they notice?

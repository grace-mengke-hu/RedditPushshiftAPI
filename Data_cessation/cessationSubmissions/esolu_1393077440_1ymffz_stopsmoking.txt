Nicotine Addiction is Nucking Futs

So today I have a pretty wicked cold.  Somehow my scumbag brain has decided that this is a trigger.  Somehow the fact I can barely breath, sneezing non stop, terribly congested and coughing is a trigger to go inhale some poison to make things 10X worse.

I mean, how could this possibly be something I would "like" or "love"...  But nicotine addiction does just that, it makes you think it's your idea and is tied to the pleasure zone in your brain to invoke similar feelings!  Man when you see this vile monster for what it really is, there is no way you will let it back in.  

Keep on keepin on!

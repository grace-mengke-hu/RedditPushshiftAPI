20 hours in and i'm really feeling the cravings.

Hey everyone. I just found this sub yesterday and I have been lurking. I'm a 21 year old female who has been smoking for 6 years now, and I decided that it's in my best interest to quit cold turkey. I've tried quitting multiple times before with vaping, but that only seemed to amplify my cravings..

I'm currently sitting here just itching for a smoke and I was wondering how everyone else handled their cravings? Gum, sunflower seeds, and chewing on straws are a couple tricks i've heard of.. Any others? Any and all advice appreciated!

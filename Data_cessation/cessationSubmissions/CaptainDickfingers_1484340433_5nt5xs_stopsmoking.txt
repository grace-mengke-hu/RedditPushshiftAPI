What are your thoughts on Vaping?

As of a week ago my friend gave me his old vape and I havent had a cigerette or craved one since... The nicotine concentration is 0.3ml which is he tells me is low so I think this could be a good way to help me quit entirely over the next few weeks. 

My lungs feel so much better at the moment and I have no flem and when playing sport I used to start gagging if I was doing a lot of cardio, this has completely gone. 

I would recommend the switch to anyone from my experiences so far. I know we are still not too sure on the issues with vaping to health but I certainly feel better and dont stink of smoke all the time!

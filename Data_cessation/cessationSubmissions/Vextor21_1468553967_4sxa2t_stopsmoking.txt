So which day is the hardest?

So I'm gonna quit this Saturday. I'm nervous because I'm the type with a lot of pride.  I've been true to my word and goals throughout life, which includes many significant things, but quitting has scared me.  As a "power through it" type of person, I was curious which day was the hardest for you.  The first day, second, fifth?  So when I hit that day I can fight.

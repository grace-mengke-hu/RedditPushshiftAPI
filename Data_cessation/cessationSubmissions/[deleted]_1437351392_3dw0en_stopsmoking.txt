Quit smoking again, and already crazing sugar and sweets. Anyone else experience this?

Hey all,

I quit smoking on Feb 17th 2013 and lasted until this past January. I started smoking Colts (little cigars) and finally caved in May while in Mexico and started smoking again. Now, when I smoke I have no sweet tooth, and do not craze deserts or anything of the sorts. Now that I've been smoke free again for 16 days, I'm crazing unhealthy sweets again.

Now I understand sugar is the lesser of two evils, but the last time I quit for almost 2 years it never really went away. 

Anyone else experience this?

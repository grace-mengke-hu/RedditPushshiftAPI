Day one... unexpected.

I dunno guys, I just woke up and went for my pack and said.. lit one...eh.. no thanks. Tossed them in the bin and then took out my trash. 

It's now 7pm. I'm.. ok? I get that urge feeling once in awhile and then think to myself "wait, I said no thanks right? Ok... so... healthy. Lets be healthy." and the continue on.

I'm hoping this isn't a fluke. That it's me really realizing how much I hate smoking. And really, I do hate it. 

Hell, I've had coffee this morning, and am about 3 drinks in tonight and I just don't care to smoke. That's what I'm working on: being apathetic. I hope in the morning I'm just as "meh" about it. 

So wish me luck. 

Edit: I read Michael Carr's book about halfway through, last week. I stopped reading (busy), but a lot of his shit pops into my head. More or less, I keep thinking, "I'm not a smoker." It's odd.

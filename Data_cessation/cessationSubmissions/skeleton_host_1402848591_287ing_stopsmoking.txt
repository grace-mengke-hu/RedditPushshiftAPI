Work From Home Need Suggestions

I'm 38, smoker from 13 to 30 quit for a little over 3 years started again 3 or 4 years ago. 

**Back Story** 
The first time I quit was rather easy as I got a stomach bug that knocked me out for multiple days. When I finally got up a few days later with no cigarettes available. I thought.. well, I'm there.. I was irritable for a few weeks but had no desire to smoke. I even had a puff/drag on day 5 when fighting with my girlfriend(possibly caused by me being miserable and slightly sick). I thought it seemed disgusting and never had cravings beyond that point. Went on a trip with my boss years later. He snuck cigarettes into business trips since his wife made him quit years ago. When I got home my girlfriend started smoking in my absence. It took a while but eventually within a few weeks it was one on Fridays.. then one on Friday and one on saturday.. then.. you know how it goes from there.

**Current Situation**
My biggest challenge this time is that I work from home and work extensive hours. I can't cut back my hours right now. I know breaking up my daily routine would make things easier. When I travel I can easily go extended  number of hours without worrying or thinking about it. However, there is no travel or breaks in the near future. Actually I'm in the middle of a huge workload that will last for at least the next 2 months.

I was going to try to quit today but I had no planning. Felt horrible last night and said I have to do this. Finished what I thought was my last cigarette. I went a few hours this morning without one, wasn't too bad. Then I went in my desk drawer for a cough drop and there was an off-brand pack from a few weeks ago, a lighter and... well.. My brain didn't stand a chance, I really didn't even consider that I messed up until after I was half way through it. 

**Game plan:**
*I have the Allen Carr app/book. I breezed through it last night and feel that "re-framing" my outlook will help. I intend on going through the book today and quitting tomorrow. 
*I'm going to Clean up get rid of the smoke smell and get rid of my tools of destruction. 
*Have my last one a few hours before bed ( I didn't buy any so I only what was left in the pack i found)
*Drink lots of water
*Toothpicks accessible (which helped a lot last time)

**The substitute debate**
I have nicotine gum and a vape handy - I'm debating getting rid of them too, so I can pull off the bandaid quick since they will just drag out the nicotine addiction. However, I'm on the fence with that. Any thoughts?

Does anyone have any suggestions considering the work from home/extensive hours situation? That's the part that freaks me out the most this time and thoughts or suggestions are welcome.

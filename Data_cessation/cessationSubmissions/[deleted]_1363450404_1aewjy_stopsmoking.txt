Last night, after bumming 4 cigarettes off of someone, I flushed the 4th down the toilet. I've finally had enough.

I started smoking six years ago. Over the last three years I've attempted to give up at least once a year, with varying levels of success. Sometimes, I'd last three weeks. Sometimes, three months. The longest I went was nine months but a crappy job, my mother being diagnosed with cancer (Leukemia; she's doing very well now) and relationship fuck-ups all led to me going back. 

Six weeks ago, I had intensive corrective surgery on my foot to fix a life-long problem and was told that during the recovery I can not smoke. I cut down massively during the months leading up to the operation. Since having it, I have smoked on three separate occasions. I had one both nights of a weekend two weeks ago and I had three last night at the afters of a wedding. I threw the forth down the toilet. I was disgusted with myself.

I woke up this morning coughing. My throat is raw. I had a headache. I had brushed my teeth before going to bed but I could still taste it. I could smell it on my clothes. I think I've had enough.

Reseting my badge, hopefully for the last time. Wish me luck!

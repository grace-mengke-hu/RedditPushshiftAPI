Quitting right now.

The half kg of bootleg tobacco I bought tastes horrible, hurts to smoke and I can't afford regular cigarettes (well, I can just don't want to spend so much on this shitty habit). My girlfriend still smokes so it's going to be hard. My plan: some mints, Allen Carr book, quit counter program on my computer, this subreddit. Hope this will work.

From the other side

So I was looking through my old post history and happened upon one of my /r/quitsmoking posts. I looked to the right and was shocked to see 601 next to my name. I just wanted to come by and offer some encouragement. It gets easier...the cravings suck at the beginning, but ya'll can do it! Even if you think you can't, you can. It's an amazing feeling to breathe again and not get out of breath walking up stairs. If you need any motivation or want to talk at all, i'm more than happy to help. Ya'll can do this!

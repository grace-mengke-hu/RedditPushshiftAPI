Once more at day 1

So last night I caved in to the voice in my head and went out and bought a pack.  After about 3 of them it hit me "What the hell am I doing?"  I put the rest of the pack under water and threw it away.  

I have sent off a request to remove my badge as well as a new one to reflect my slip up last night.

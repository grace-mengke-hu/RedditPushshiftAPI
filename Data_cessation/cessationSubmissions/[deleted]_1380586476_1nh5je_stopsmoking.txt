no more

I've been smoking since I was 15 years old, I am currently 28. 13 years is too long. I just smoked my last cigarette. I attempted in the past to stop, but always came back. 
I understand why I always went back to smoking: I was never serious about it. But I am now, and will be the next day, and the day after that. I am currently 100% satisfied with the direction my life is going. It took me a long time to find that direction.
This fall I started nursing school. I never thought I would've gotten into the program. But I worked hard and I don't want to mess up. I will not smoke because I don't want to mess up my health as much as I already did. I know nursing school is stressful, I can already see how stressful it is, even being in the program for a month. But I now recognize all the stressors and I will over come them. 
  
Guys/Gals, thanks for reading this entry, and I wish all of you luck!

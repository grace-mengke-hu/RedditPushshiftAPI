6 days today, but horrified

So I've managed to stop smoking now for the past 6 days (I turned 30 exactly a week ago and have been on a pack a day for the past 12 years). 

I decided to force myself into reading some statistics to make sure I stick with it. 

However I can't help but have the feeling I've waited too long. I know it's never too late to quit, but a big part of me believes it is.

What should I do? Are there any checkups I can get to put my mind at ease, particularly regarding the "c" word...

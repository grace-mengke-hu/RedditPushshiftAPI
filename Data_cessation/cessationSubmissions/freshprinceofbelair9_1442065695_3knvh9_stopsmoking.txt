Cigarettes take away your dignity.

So, say there was only you and one last pack of cigarettes in the world and a seagull took that pack of cigarettes and dropped it in the trash. You know you're tempted to dig through it. What the hell, man? You're a human being, with gifts such as abstract thinking, the capacity to create a subjective meaning in your life while we're still looking for the objective truth, you're part of the race that has created systems such as communism, capitalism, and imperialism, each brilliant in their own sense... and *you're going to subjugate yourself by being tempted to spend time you'll never get back by looking through a bin of garbage for a few inched sticks that lie to you anyway?* It's no different in real life. You're going to subject yourself by going to the store and support the very thing that killed half of the population of Native Americans? But I digress. You can do this, get some dignity, stop pitying yourself because you CHOSE to take the cigarette, and transcend from victim. Be a nonsmoker.

Now, have a nice day. I hope my storytelling was amusing yet helpful.

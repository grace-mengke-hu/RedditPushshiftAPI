How can I help my SO quit smoking?

She's told me many times that she wants to quit smoking. Both of us have different lifestyles where fitness is very important to me. I take her running because she wants to slim down but the smoking slows her down. 

She stopped for a while until this week where she had half a cigarette when she saw her friend, and told me she bought a pack today because "she was stressed and only wanted just one".

We went running the other day and she threw up after after having that half-cigarette. I can't help but feel... a bit disappointed that she bought more?

I understand that it's not my life and totally her decision, but she still wants to quit sometime. Is there any advice I can take into consideration to help her quit without sounding controlling and/or mean about it?

Got a copy of Allen Carr's Book...

Now what? I mean, I read it a few years ago after I'd quit and stayed quit for about 2 months before picking this nasty habit again. Right now I am still smoking. But should I just quit right now and then go on to read the book or keep smoking while I read it, as the book says you can? I mean... I know it sounds silly, but is there a benefit to reading it while you are still smoking?

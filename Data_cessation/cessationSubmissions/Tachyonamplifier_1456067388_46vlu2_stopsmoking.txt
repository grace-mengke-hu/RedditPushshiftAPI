9 1/2 months since my last cigarette

I don't post much but I came across this subreddit and I thought I'd share. Maybe I can help someone. I quit smoke 9 1/2 months ago after smoking for six years. I didn't smoke for as long as plenty of people I know but it was enough to develop an addiction. I've tried quitting before, but no method worked. Finally, I decided cold turkey was it for me...I mean I could start smoking again if I really didn't like it, right? Two things surprisingly helped me the most. 

The first was keeping a quit smoking app to track my progress. Once I got to about a week I started having my own personal goals (one week, two weeks, one month, six months). 

The second was telling just about everyone I know. So many people were proud of me each passing month that I didn't want to disappoint them. 

The first couple months I felt like an entirely different person. I always assumed breaking the habit would be the biggest issue, but I actually felt my body detoxing from Nicotine. Once my body beat that (taking at least three months to be feel totally normal), being around family and friends who still smoked was the hardest...I have a lot of them. I thought about it all the time. Sometimes I still do. I'd love to talk about this with people and hopefully I can be the one to help. Not having anyone in my life who understands the struggle is a bit difficult.

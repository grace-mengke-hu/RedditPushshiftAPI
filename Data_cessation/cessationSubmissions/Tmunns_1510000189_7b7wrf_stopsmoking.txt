Not a single smokey stick in two weeks. Heck yeah.

More or less for my own record so that I can look back at this if I need it... I was seriously anxious the first week or so, but at this point I only get a couple cravings a day, and I feel quite calm most of the time. I also think I am sleeping better now. Plus, I have way more energy to do things throughout the day. The cravings are managable and I enjoy the newfound luxury of smelling and tasting. Cigarettes offer me nothing other than a disorienting light-headed feeling, and I don't think its worth killing myself over.

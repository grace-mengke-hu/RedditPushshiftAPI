1 year and didn't do it alone!

My husband and I hit our 1 year mark today! It was great quitting cold turkey with my husband. I wasn't alone and we were in the same boat together. All of our closest friends cheered us on, as they have seen us smoke for the past 12 years(some still smokers, some non-smokers, some former smokers). 

I am so unbelievable happy! We have had some really trying times this past year and we still didn't light up a single cigarette. Woohoo!

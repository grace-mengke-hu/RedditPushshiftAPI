On another note, I am sneezing alot.

in the last while, I noticed that I am sneezing a lot. I distinctly remember not sneezing this much...where I would probably sneeze a few times per week. Now, I am sneezing a couple of times per day...everywhere...at home and at work.

my environment hasn't changed, and we are now transitioning from Summer to Autumn, so I cannot really say its the Spring pollen rush...

Only thing I can say with certainty is that I quit smoking recently. anyone else having a similar experience? I am not saying its a bad thing, only that its a plausible thought that maybe my sneeze reflexes was broken as a smoker, now they working again? i dunno.

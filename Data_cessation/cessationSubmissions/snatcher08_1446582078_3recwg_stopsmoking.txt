13 days smoke free

Until my last smoke 13 days ago I never  seriously saw myself quitting or making an attempt. Something in my brain switched almost without a thought I just decided I was a non smoker and haven't touched one since I have had withdrawal symptoms and developed strep throat as a result of these however since I decided I was a non smoker I haven't had a craving for a cigarette even drinking and being near smokers not one craving best decision I've ever made and I wish the best of luck to everyone else quitting!! --- UPDATE 1 month and 2 days smoke free going strong Jamaica trip in 3 weeks should be the real challenge

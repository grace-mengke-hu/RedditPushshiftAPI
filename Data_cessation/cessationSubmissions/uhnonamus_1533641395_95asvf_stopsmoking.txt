Are there even admins?

I’m starting to see why there are so many complaint posts about this group. Are there even any admins for this group? 

I kind of think that’s important here. I woke up to a comment on my quit smoking post “That suck sucks. It’s a sucky suck. That sucks.”

Obviously whoever left the comment is a moron with nothing better to do but last night I watched another user in the group comment “you probably have cancer and should just smoke again.”

Seriously?

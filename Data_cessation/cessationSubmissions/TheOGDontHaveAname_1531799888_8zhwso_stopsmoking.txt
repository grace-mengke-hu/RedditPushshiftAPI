Anger during withdrawal

This is the best source of information on the interwebs. Hands down. Real people. Real discussion. Not some phony textbook answers. 
Short story long. Day 14 of cold turkey after 22 years of cigs, and I‚Äôm totally curious on anyone else‚Äôs journey, and their experiences with anger that just appears out of nowhere. I would also like to add that I gave up smoking pot(22 years, and pretty much daily for 15 years with an occasional break), chewing tobacco(22 years), and drinking energy drinks at the same time. Yep, total gusto this go round, but I am straight determined this time to succeed. I gave up drinking somewhere around 2.5 years ago, so I already know the will power is there to give up the rest of these ‚Äúlovely‚Äù vices that grab us and hold on like no other. The 1st week was actually a breeze for me, and with the amount of determination I have, I‚Äôm not surprised that the cravings for the actual cigarette itself weren‚Äôt that strong. The hardest part for me has been the lack of the ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù chemicals that nicotine mimics. I think the struggle is mostly in our brain, and the chemicals that mess with it. I was able to replace/distract myself from the physical act of smoking. But day 6 is when the anger basically hit me like a Mack truck, and I just got mad at well, absolutely nothing, and everything. It ebbs and flows, and now at day 14 it‚Äôs subsiding. I hope. Basically I snapped on the ones I care about the most(sadly, isn‚Äôt that the caseüò¢), but I would love to hear from anyone who has gone through this anger stage, and if you have any tips, advice, supplements, foods, anything for me/other‚Äôs dealing with this. Keep on fighting the good fight everyone, I can already tell a major difference in me after 14 days, so I can only imagine what the future holds!

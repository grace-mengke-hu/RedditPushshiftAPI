I quit a week ago but my wife didn't! What do I do?

After going out saturday night--smoking, drinking while coming down with a cold--I took that first drag Sunday morning and it was so purely repulsive I threw it out and the rest of the pack right there. I had a bad enough cold that I couldn't think about smoking for two days at least. 

I also had developed a new way of thinking about quitting. Instead of feeling like I was resisting or denying myself smoking, I felt like I was finally getting out of a shitty relationship and didn't want to think about it or do anything that would remind me of it. I have never been this dedicated to quitting like this before in my life. I have smoked about 22 years, I'm 37.

My wife says she is "proud and jealous" of me quitting but can't do it herself right now. We have been talking about quitting for months! She wants to, but says she just can't.

How do I deal with this? I feel disappointed and annoyed she isn't quitting. I don't like that cigarettes are in the house and are too available if I were to have urges.  

I also have an extreme revulsion to the smell and just all around hate everything about smoking. 

What is ok for me to ask her to do? what isn't OK? Can I basically ask her to become a secret smoker so I don't have to see or deal with it? anyone else dealing with this? I just don't want to resent her for smoking and have it put a strain on the marriage. I also don't want to support her smoking either. thanks!

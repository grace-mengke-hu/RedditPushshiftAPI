How should I quit vaping?

So a quick smoking history, I only smoked for a year and I had 3-5 smokes a day. I wanted to stop the after the first pack, but it was too hard. At my peak I smoked 7 a day. 
I quit a month and a half ago and I'm a bit proud that I'm not poisoning my body with cigs anymore, but when I quit I started to vape and now it's really hard to quit that. 
I love the nicotine buzz from vapes and I think they're a better alternative but I wanna cut that out of my life as well. 
I went cold turkey before and it was HORRIBLE, how can I not experience that and still quit vaping?

Thank you

Started new job and decided to quit smoking

I've started a new job serving and decided to quit smoking. I feel so much better but horrible at the same time. Today is my third day nicotine free and I just got home from work. It feels like my work performance has been affected...I got some really bad tips today which makes me question my decision to quit.

After work I decided to get a carrot juice instead of buying a pack, so I got that going for me...Thanks for listening to me vent, and good luck to everyone trying to break this horrible habit. We are strong!

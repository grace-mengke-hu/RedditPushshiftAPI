One month today and my old lady hands are gone!

I (29F) had started smoking back in 2005. My hands had been so dry for years. They cracked, would split and bleed at creases and my knuckles. 

My hands looked like granny hands no matter what I tried with them. I never knew that it was related to smoking. I always thought it was my job that had ruined the moisture balance. 

Within a week I noticed a difference. I have youthful hands again! All around my skin and hair look and feel better. My teeth feel better like the layer of grime is gone and they actually feel slippery. I didnâ€™t remember that. 

Lots of positives, so far the only thing that sucks is being able to smell all the terrible smells that much better. B.O., stinky feet, husband microwaving hotdogs, and driving passed the slaughterhouse is so much more revolting! I am not gonna peace the fuck out when someone cooks fish. Small price friends. 

Did anything take you by surprise when you quit?

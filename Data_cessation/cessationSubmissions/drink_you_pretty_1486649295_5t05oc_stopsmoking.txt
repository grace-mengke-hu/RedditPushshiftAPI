Finally decided to quit!

Well, as the title says I finally decided to stop smoking. This is actually my third try, but this time I feel much more motivated, don't know why. I haven't smoked a cigarette since Sunday morning and I'm honestly feeling good! I have downloaded Kwit and Smoke Free, and it's nice to see how much money I'm actually saving.

Just wanted to thank you all guys, this truly seems like a really nice and supportive sub!

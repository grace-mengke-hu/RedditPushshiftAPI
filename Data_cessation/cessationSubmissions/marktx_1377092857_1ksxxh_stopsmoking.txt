Hypothetical question

Let's say they developed a cigarette that did not harm your health (or those around you) at all and was inexpensive ($5 for 200).


The smell/odour would remain, and you'd still be addicted

And let's say they were able to flavour them just like your favourite former brand.


Would you smoke?

Today is my day 1, again...

Last time I had quit, I was quiet about it and did so cold turkey. It lasted upwards of 6/7 months it was fantastic! I did this around the same time I told myself no more elevators (it's a big deal when I work on the 5th floor and have classes all spread out over about 1/2 mi. around campus). I started up again I don't even remember maybe 2 months ago, I usually smoke hardly anything 2 to 3 cigs a day, my doctor even laughed at me when I said yes to the "are you a smoker and how much a day do you smoke" question because apparently I'm almost a "non-smoker" hah. My friends have an issue with my quitting, I'm not sure what it is but when I had first quit the very first time about a year and a half ago, they kept pushing me and pushing me to smoke. Thankfully I don't live in town so I only got that pressure when I visited. I still don't understand their issue with me quitting but I never told them again that I was quitting, every time after that I was quiet about it. Maybe they don't want to see me achieve more than them, or something. Anyways, this time I want to make it stick, I finished the last cig of my last pack far too many times and am ready to consider myself a non-smoker once again! When I started up again a couple months ago I finally told myself "you're an addict the fuck is wrong with you!" instead of the usual "oh, i can stop whenever i want" bullshit. Cold turkey definitely works best for me, but I'd like some tips on how to quite successfully please. I already know from the other times I've quit that hiding all my lighters is key as well as singing along to the radio to fill in the gap on my daily commute that cigs that once filled.

Made it through Christmas!!

Just an update because I was worried, but I didn't break down and my husband's family was a lot more supportive than I expected. The only non smokers on that side are my husband, his mom, and now me. They were all aware that I've quit and were extra careful to walk away from me when they lit up. 

I still smelled it and I still wanted one, but I got through it and didn't cave!

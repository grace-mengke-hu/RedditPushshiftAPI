Cravings Question for those more experienced than me...

Hi everyone.  I'm certainly not an active "poster", nor commenter, but I definitely credit you guys to helping me quit on Feb 11, at 21:31 Pacific Time. :-)

I have a question for those who are further along than I am.  I've noticed that lately I've been getting cravings to smoke again.  Nothing like the first few days, but it's surprizing.  I have friends staying over who are all smokers, and I have a feeling it's related to that, but until now, I would have thought I had this thing kicked.  Writing this is one way I'm trying not to head to the gas station and buy a pack.  At one point I even contemplated "borrowing" a smoke from their lonely pack on the windowsill.  Do any of you guys still get periodic cravings even 5, 6 months later?  Is it just a matter of waiting out my friends leaving?  Any advice?  

Thanks for your thoughts...

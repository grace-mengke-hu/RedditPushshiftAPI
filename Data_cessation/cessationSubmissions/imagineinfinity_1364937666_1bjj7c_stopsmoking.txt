Smoked since 13, 30 now. Dad (also a smoker) has COPD. First day cold turkey, now I am a non-smoker and NEED SUPPORT!

Basically, I shared it all in the title. I am a 30 year old man and I have tried and failed to quit many times before. Picked up chew at 13 and quickly switched to cigs. Most of the years I smoked camel lights and now american spirits. I usually burn 10 a day unless boozing then maybe a pack. Tried Chantix and had the dreams. Did nicorette and just used it for inconvenient times like flights or ball games. Many years ago I promised my Mom that I would quit when I am married but since that hasn't happened yet I need to live my 30s differently than my teens and twenties. This is my plan; tell all the people I know about my transition to being a non-smoker. When cravings hit, I repeat the mantra that I AM A NON-SMOKER to retrain the synapses that have grown so strong with repetition over the years. This coupled with my Fathers recent diagnosis(COPE) is more than enough for me to shake this demon and regain my health. Thanks Reddit, I appreciate the good vibes and encouragement!

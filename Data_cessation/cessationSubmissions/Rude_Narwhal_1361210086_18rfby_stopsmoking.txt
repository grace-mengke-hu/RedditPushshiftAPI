I had my last cig 366 days ago.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking, I've hit my goal of a year and owe a large part of my success to this subreddit. To everyone else trying to hit that year mark, you can do it :)

Edit: Thank you all for your support, to those under and over that one month hump it does get easier, I doubt I'll ever pick up another cig again. Again, thank you all.

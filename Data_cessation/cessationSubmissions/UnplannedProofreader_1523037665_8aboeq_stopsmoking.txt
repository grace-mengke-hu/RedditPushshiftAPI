Laying in bed all day, reading stuff on my phone again. Guess I live here now.

Don’t mind me, I just feel the need to complain.

Self employed:work from home so I can take ridiculously long breaks and just work really late to make up for it but I’m getting irritated with myself.  I’m supposed to be having easier days by now but I feel like mentally it’s gotten so much worse.  

Can’t smoke, want to smoke, going back to bed so I don’t get in my car and drive to the corner store.

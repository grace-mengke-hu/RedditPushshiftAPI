Everything smells so good!

My bed, my laundry, my house, my hair, food, the oils I diffuse, deodorant, all of it! I was lying in bed this morning just smelling my sheets, lol.  Tonight, I can smell the shampoo and conditioner in my hair.  I am sleeping in some Chanel #5 bc I cannot get over all the good smells!  Might be my favorite perk from not smoking so far, besides the deeeeeep breaths.

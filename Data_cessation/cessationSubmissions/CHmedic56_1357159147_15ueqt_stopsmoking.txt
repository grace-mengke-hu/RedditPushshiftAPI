Day 1

After smoking at least a pack a day for the past seven years. This morning i woke up and decided i didn't want to smoke anymore and i just didn't go buy a pack. I was out on new years and a random girl stopped talking to me when she found out i smoked, maybe that's what triggered me. Well whatever it was, here's to hoping i can say next new years i am a non smoker!

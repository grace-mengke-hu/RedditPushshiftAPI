2nd star!

Ahoy! 

There we go, 60 days! Felt rather short to be honest! 

I can not really add much to my experiences from my previous posts, I do a hell of a lot of fitness exercises and start to look like it too! I catch myself watching myself in the mirror like an idiot, haha.

The past two months confronted me with many challenges. having my fiancée abroad for a month while our very young cat died was by far the worst part of it. But i did not cave then so I am pretty sure none of the hardships of day-to-day life I will have to endure will make me  crave a cigarette as much as that event. We do not need cigarettes to cope with things. We never did. We never will.

But to end things on a lighter note this weekend will be the first time I get to enjoy the fucking best brunch in town in a 5-star hotel for the birthday of my fiancées grandma without having an impaired sense of smell/taste! Huzzah! This might read like nothing to you, but man, I am all giddy about this! They have all the best food! It will be amazing! Also it is my fiancées birthday next week and I have a myriad of little things prepared for that. Can't wait to watch her reactions :P

Talk to you next month! Take care everybody!

I feel like I'm quitting, continuously...

I haven't smoked since I quit, and I'm not going to start again.  The beginning was rough, but it was a trial, something to conquer and move past.  For whatever reason, when I quit, I felt like I had a lot of energy...even though I felt half brain dead, physically, I felt like exercising and being extremely active.  Now I've fallen into this slump...Mentally I feel better than I did before; I don't worry about cigarettes when I'm trying to be productive, and the everyday anxiety and stress of my life is manageable.  But physically, the energy and motivation is just gone.  When I see someone smoking, or even just smell smoke lately, it has been making me just want to get back into it again.  I feel like I have to prevent myself from falling back into this old habit on a near constant basis.  

This might seem as though I'm having second thoughts about quitting, but I'm not.  I've no real desire to start smoking again.  But what I have is this desire for the feeling that smoking gave me.? Does anyone have any thoughts on how to handle this?

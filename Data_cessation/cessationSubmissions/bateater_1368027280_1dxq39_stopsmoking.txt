6 months smoke free today!

Thanks guys for all your wise words and all your help along the way. I've been cigarette free for 6 months now and I can't be happier. I've decided to eat better and exercise more and take up rock climbing to help get me back in shape. Remember everyone out there that is struggling it is possible and it's definitely worth it!

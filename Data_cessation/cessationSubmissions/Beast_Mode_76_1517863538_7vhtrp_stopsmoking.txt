I no longer crave cigarettes but now I crave sweets

I have been doing great with not smoking, after the first couple weeks I didn't miss it one bit.  Quitting smoking gave me the motivation to eat more healthy and exercise more, so I was trying to lose a few lbs but I can't stop eating sweets.  

But now I think I may have accidentally replaced one habit with another.  It's much like a cigarette craving, I just feel like I have to have it right now even though I know I'm not really hungry and don't need it.  

My brain just craves something, and I need to figure out how to satisfy it in a more healthy way.  It only happens between dinner and bedtime, I think I become more tired and lose the energy to resist my urges. Before, when I got an urge or craving I assumed it was for nicotine so I'd just have a smoke and that fixed it for a while.  

So...has anyone else ran into this since you quit?  Do you still have these cravings that you can't control?  And ideas on how to deal with it?  I'm thinking I'll try a small piece of fruit or a mint or something low calorie.

I had almost quit and then my girlfriend of 2 years dumped me and threw my life upside down.

I was gradually moving down to 2 cigarettes a day but then this heartbreak occurred and I have gone up to a pack a day. Whenever I get sad or anxious or mad I have had a cigarette and it has just knocked me so far back.

Smoking Anxiety Dreams...

This is my fourth time quitting, and the first time I've attempted it without Chantix... I'm doing patches this time around. I've always gotten vivid dreams when quittting, but this time around I'm having lots of anxiety dreams where I A)Run out of patches B)Succumb to smoking again, etc... And I also don't feel very rested in the morning.

I'm on 24 hour patches, and I'm wondering if I shouldn't have them on at night...? Thoughts? Experiences with patches?

UPDATE:  Took my patch off before going to bed last night, and I do think that helped.  A little more rested feeling today. I've also found out there are 16 hour patches, and I think I might switch to those.

How to fight urges?

I'm on day four here, cold turkey. Last night I had a dream about smoking a cigarette, I'm not even joking. All day today it is all I have thought about. I'm only 22 and have only smoked for two years unlike some people who have for there whole lives. I'm trying to stop before it becomes a major problem but obviously it already is. How do you fight this? The urges? I'm trying to keep myself distracted 24/7 but it doesn't seem to be working. I still haven't smoked, but I am so damn close to going to get a pack. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your good advice, I am doing fine and have not smoked, day 4 was not a good day haha.

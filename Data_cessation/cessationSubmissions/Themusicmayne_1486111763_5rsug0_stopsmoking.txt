I haven't smoked since Monday!

I've been wanting to give up for a while now, but really thought it'd be super hard.

With some recommendations from this sub to read Allen Carr's book, I've now stopped and it couldn't have been easier. Thank you all who recommended the book, I really believe it was the book that helped, and I would recommend it to anyone!

Thanks to everyone on this sub reddit, I think its a great place.

Good luck to everyone on your journey, you can do it, we can all do it!

Just smoked my first cigarette after nine months, and I hate myself for it

Sorry if this is a bit disorganized and negative, but I feel like everything I went through to quit has been wasted in a blink of an eye, and I'm on back where I started. This is the worst thing that could happen to me right now, and I don't know what to do, this self-hatred and feeling of vulnerability is why I decided quit in the first place.. I was wrong to think I could do it all by myself, that I won't ever be "that stupid' again.. This time instead of avoiding the issue and assuming that 'thinking about it will just make it harder', I will be aware of my progress every step of the way, and remember that I'm just one mistake away from falling back into the damn trap.

God I hate Saturdays..

3 weeks smoke free, but suddenly struggling.

Smoke Free suggested I come here for support a few days back. I am doing so today, at my 3 week mark.


I just graduated to Step 3 patches today. I've heard that it get's a little harder at Step 3, but I guess I wasn't prepared for my mind to get as rocked about as it is.


My mind is all over the place. I keep dreaming about cigarettes. It always revolves around me smoking, "forgetting" I was quitting, remembering, and becoming super upset with myself.


It's so hard to wake up in the morning. I called out from work yesterday because I wanted to sleep all day.


I'm sorry if this is kind of incoherent. Help. I don't want to give up!
I need a boost, a pep talk. . . Thank you everyone and happy quitting.

Numbness, tingling, cold feeling in arms and hands??

I'm cutting down on my cigarette intake hard in preparation for quitting, since going straight up cold turkey never worked for me.
I've smoked about 4 cigarettes in the past 10 days (as opposed to my usual 6-8 smokes a day).

I've noticed my hands get kind of numb feeling and tingly, especially if i hold them up for too long. And my hands/forearms feel like they're kind of cold as well. The feeling goes up to my elbows but never really above that.

I read somewhere that its because smoking messes with your circulation, and these feelings are your body trying to adjust to the new bloodflow?

Not many people I know what have quit smoking have experienced this though, is it uncommon?

Have any of you guys gotten this as well? To me it's more annoying than anything else that comes with quitting, it really gets to me.

You know the hate you have towards the cigarette your smoking

So I quit smoking for four months last year and then landed myself on probation....couldn't smoke marijuana so I picked cigarettes back up and hydrocodone while I was at it actually.  So I've kicked the habit of the painkillers where I was up to taking 8-10 norcos a day, and anyone that has been addicted knows it goes without saying they where 10 milligrams.  Here I am 29 years old I've been smoking a pack a day  since I was 18 maybe 17 even and I've reached a point where I don't even enjoy but actually despise the cigarette I'm smoking half way through it so it's time to quit and I hopefully smoked my last cigarette before bed last night now it's been probably 14 hours and I'm just thinking about how I'm going to freak out but haven't really done so yet.  Any ideas to keep my mind off the subject would be greatly appreciated.....I have decided to hit a one hitter instead of a cigarette to get the feel of the smoke in my lungs the first few days with the cravings....And I have accomplished staying higher than most mornings and haven't had a cigarette....that in its self seems like a success

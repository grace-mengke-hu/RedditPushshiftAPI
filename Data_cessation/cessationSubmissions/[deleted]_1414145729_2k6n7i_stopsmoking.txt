I am not a 'social smoker'. I'm a smoker and it needs to stop.

I never buy my own tobacco. I always just bum off friends and people outside bars. Yes I am that dick, sorry. The problem is I'm in university and the social life is virtually constant. It's gotten to the point where I'm on basically a cigarette a day, often much more.

I'm aware how fundamentally retarded smoking is, my dad went through absolute hell quitting ten years ago. I always regret it. But once I've had a drink or get social, I get a mad craving for tobacco. I am addicted like anyone else, if not in the same degree, the same kind.

My breathing is getting short, I'm coughing all the time. It needs to fucking stop before I begin properly smoking, I've been very tempted to go buy a pack a few times. It needs to stop now.

Quit on Sunday, went out to a bar last night with friends...

The temptation was enormous and I caved. Bummed about five smokes over the night... and every single one was completely fucking disgusting. I woke up today feeling miserable, and I really didn't drink much, so I blame the cigarettes.

How the hell did I actually enjoy this for ten years?

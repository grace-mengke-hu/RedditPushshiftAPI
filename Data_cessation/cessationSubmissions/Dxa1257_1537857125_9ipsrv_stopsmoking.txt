Relapsed at Day 42

For 35 Days i went really strong and almost forgot about smoking.

On Day 35, i smoked blunt and alcohol which was a first in a long time. Shared 2 smokes at the end of my session.

Next day i was on a pleasant hangover and went on a 200 mile bike ride, constantly wanting to light one up to get the high again. Finally i lit one up and didnt get any effect of it. 

After all this, i thought about it and said to myself that i wont go hard on myself and not reset my flair and counters.Did not light for 6 straight days.

On day 42, i shared smokes without any reason and then lit up 3 smokes all for myself. That was it,i just reset everything and now i am on day 1.

Also i am thinking to give up all vices(blunt and alcohol) to avoid one.

Any advices/feedbacks are welcome.

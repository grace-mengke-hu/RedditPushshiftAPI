Am I even doing this right?

So, I quit smoking 12 days ago and during the past 12 days I have been smoking a vape pen. It has the lowest amount of nicotine, but I  want to go down to where it's no nicotine at all. I just like the feeling of smoking something and this fixes that want. I feel like I'm cheating the stop smoking system, but I haven't wanted a cigarette. Am I doing this wrong?

I think I'm ready.

I've been smoking daily for 2 years, and I think I'm ready to quit. 

About 2 weeks ago I broke up with my SO of 1.5 years, who was a heavy smoker. At first the number of cigarettes I would have a day only went down by a few, but lately I've only been having 2-3 a day. They just make me think of him, and how alone I am now. I can sit on reddit all day without feeling that lonely, but when I have a cigarette it just feels like he should be there to share it with me. It makes smoking one a lot less satisfying. 

But I don't just want to do it because of him. Im ready because:

* I'm tired of being self concious because of how I smell. It makes me feel like no one wants to be around me. I need friends, and the people I want to hang out with dont smoke. Also, I feel like my professors won't want me for research either because they don't want me stinking up their lab/leaving for a cigarette (I'm a chem major).

* I'm starting to notice my teeth getting yellow. Shit's nasty. 

* My very blunt non-smoker friend told me that I look much older than I am because of my smoking. 

* I miss being able to run. I used to do track and feild but now I can't even get up the stairs without getting winded.

* My lungs HURT. Not just when I run anymore. They hurt from when I wake up in the morning to when I go to bed at night. Also, the shit that I cough up all day is disgusting.

* I'm visiting family over spring break (1 week from now) who don't know that I smoke. I hate that evertime I see them I have to quit, because they are not calming people to be around. The withdrawel makes me want to bite their fucking heads off.

* I don't want to date a smoker. I don't want to smoke for the rest of my life and I don't want to have a partner that does. Unfortunatley, it's really hard to convince dudes to shove their tounge in my mouth when it tastes like an ashtray (not that I'm trying right now).


I'm so weak though. I got through most of yesterday and then caved around 9 pm. I haven't had one yet today, but it is all I can think about. I know that I'm going to cave. My roomate will go out to have one and I'll drift out there with her without thinking twice.

I think I'm ready... but maybe tomorrow^help^me

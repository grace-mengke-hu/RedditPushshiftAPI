ONE MONTH!

I cannot even begin to explain how grateful I am to everyone on this sub who posts and comments and helps each other out. The support structure here has prevented many a relapse. I feel like I am finally at the point where I don't think about smoking every day. Sometimes I think back to the days of scrounging dirty ashtrays for butts to smoke when I ran out of cigarettes. The fact that I did such unsanitary, reckless things truly cements the disgusting power of this addiction in my mind. I will never go there again. Keep it up guys, we are all winners!

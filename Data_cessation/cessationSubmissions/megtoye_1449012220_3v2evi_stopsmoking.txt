Withdrawal...Quit Zits...Quitters flu etc., On last step of patch

Hi
I've been quit for a few months now. I stayed on the first stage of the patch until I stopped thinking about cigarettes or had any desire for one. I am finally now on the last stage (7 mg of nicotine a day) and I keep getting flu like symptoms. I was fine for about two days and then I appeared to get the same symptoms all over again. I feel weak all over, I have a terrible headache, I can't do anything. At this point I am wondering if I should just scrap the patch all together and let the withdrawal set in completely.
I guess what I am wondering is... Is there any point on being on 7mg/nicotine a day if I am still getting these terrible withdrawal symptoms with the patch on?
How long will this feeling last?
Also, has anyone else experienced cystic acne around the chin when they were quitting? It is adding to my misery.

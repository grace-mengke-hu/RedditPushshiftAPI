Dealing with a deep lung itch?

Since I quit smoking about a month and a half ago I've frequently been experiencing what I can only describe as a deep, itchy sensation in my lungs. Taking deep breaths helps a little bit, but it feels like I just can't inhale enough at once to satisfy that itch, and it's not really showing any signs of letting up.

At this point, that sensation is basically the only thing left in my life that makes me really want a cigarette, because that's the only thing that comes to mind that'd be coarse enough to scratch that itch.

Is there anything other than deep breathing that can help deal with this sort of feeling? It's extremely irritating and derails my attention to the point that it is basically the only thing I can really focus on for hours at a time. I'm worried that if I don't find an effective solution, I'm going to end up smoking a cigarette just to get a modicum of relief from that persistant itch.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you.

Day 3

Starting to feel better (had a bad flu the past four days or so), and of course the cravings are starting to come back in a major way. 

I don't want to fuck up this time. I recently had 14 days and went back to smoking, and it was a terrible feeling ultimately. I don't want to go backwards. 

Thanks for listening.

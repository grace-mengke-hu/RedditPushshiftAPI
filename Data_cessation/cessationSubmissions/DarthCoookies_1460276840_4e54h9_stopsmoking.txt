I was in a fire , went to hospital with smoke injury , quitting cigarretes today.

Hello reddit.

So i was on a fire a few days a go , and i rushed inside a small room to try to find the source , as the result i went to the hospital with smoke inhalation problems,breath problems,vomit, dizzy , high blood pressure and in a bit of a bad condition overall.

I now have a diferent point of view about fires , i never tought it would be so hard to breathe inside a very heavy smoke enviroment. And i now can understand the panic of some people , and i have a lot of respect for people running into fires to save people and stuff.

But i am better now . I have been a smoker for around 20 years, i already try quitting in the past (3 times) but i failed , now i was already thinking about this for a month or so , and the fire and hospital made me retink my all life .

So it´s now 10 hours since the last one, this is the easy part for me , (I am using nicotine gum to easy the "pain" 2mg ) the hard one will be the next weeks , months ....

Smoking is so stupid that i feel like an ass for doing it , it´s so expensive , it takes 10% minimum of my wage and i really need money .... this is just ridiculous, i i hope this is the time i do it for good . Why in the hell should i be spending so much money on this crap . It as funny , i like to smoke , but its just burning money and health.

Any questions or tip´s feel free to ask or help.

Ps: English not my main language ,and not in the mood to check every word as i am already nervous as shit sorry for mistakes.

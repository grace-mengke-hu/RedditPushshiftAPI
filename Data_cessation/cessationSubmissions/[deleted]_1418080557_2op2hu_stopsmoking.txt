Here I go again

So I feel off, again. :(  I went to the office the other night to work, I mostly work from home, btw, and it all started with me getting one cigarette from a co-worker and the next thing I knew, that morning after work I was buying a pack.  I feel like shit.  Going to give this a go again, and and hoping that this time will be my last time stopping.

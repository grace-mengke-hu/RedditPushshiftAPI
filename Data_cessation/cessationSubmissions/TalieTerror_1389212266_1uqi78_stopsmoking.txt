You were really cute... but you stank.

So when I was a smoker, I used to hear people say they would never date smokers. I never thought it was that big a deal. Bit of gum, some body spray, you're good to go. Well, today I was at the dog park and I met this really attractive guy. We were chatting about our dogs and then he lit up a smoke. Oh my god, why did I do that to people around me?! I must have smelt like that ALL THE TIME. Instant and -serious- turn off. I had to walk away. 

Now, my cravings are low, my fear of withdrawal again is still HIGH, and I'm feelin' good. If I can do this, so can you!

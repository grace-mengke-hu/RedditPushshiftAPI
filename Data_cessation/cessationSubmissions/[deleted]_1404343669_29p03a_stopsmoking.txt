I can't do anything in moderation!!


That is apparently the motto of my life.. well at least as it applies to smoking!! 

Smoked at total of 18 years now (as a kid wanted to be like my older bros, terrible mistake) and at 33 time to quit .. again.

If i'm not smoking a pack a day i have to do some other extreme: I quit last year for 3 months. In that time i trained for and ran a marathon. 
Pretty much the day i was done, i went and bought a pack and proceeded to smoker harder and more than before. Until 1 year later i couldn't breath for an entire week(only today feeling better), lungs hurt, smelled, etc etc etc

Just tired to those little tobacco filled sticks of pain being such a huge part of my life. Due to all the amazing support here i've been holding strong. So 9 days in now.. and i think i'll go for a run!

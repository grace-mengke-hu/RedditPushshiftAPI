A horror story...

This may be a little off topic, but I felt it had to be shared.

I'm 20 days smoke free now (very proud of myself). The entire time, I had been using sunflower seeds to stem the oral gratification. I'd start eating them when felt cravings - it was something to do to keep my mouth busy. Over time, I started just eating handfuls, without even de-shelling them.

This morning, I went to take my morning shit. It was extremely painful - I realized it was the shells of the seeds I'd been eating at an increasing rate the past three weeks! It felt like razors sliding down my ass hole. After the ordeal, I looked down and saw bright red blood all up in the toilet.

Now I'm being introduced to parts of the internet I never wanted to see or know existed, like www.bloodinpoop.com. 

(I did a bit of research on this, and its fine, I have a couple treatments I'll try, but for the most part you just wait it out)

Anyway, probably gonna try switching to cinnamon gum, as someone else on this sub suggested. And please, learn from my mistakes: take the fucking shells off your seeds.

Personal bests

A month and a half ago, I posted here about a seemingly crazy idea. I said that I was thinking about using training for a triathlon as a motivation to stay smoke free. You all reassured me that it wasn't such a crazy idea, so long as it helps me avoid relapse, and to go for it.

I'm happy to say that I am still smoke free. This time it feels permanent. Yes, I still get cravings, but getting through another day as a non-smoker is much more appealing to me.

My training is progressing more quickly than I had anticipated. In the past three days, I've set personal bests in all three sports. Sunday, I rode 18 miles to the nearest town, ate a nice lunch there, and caught a ride home with my husband. Today, I ran two miles. Then I completed a full workout with the Masters swim group at my health club, just over a mile. It feels amazing to reclaim my lungs after 25 years of heavy smoking.

To those who, like me, have tried and tried and tried to quit but keep starting again, please keep trying. Every failure brings you closer to success, but only if you keep trying.

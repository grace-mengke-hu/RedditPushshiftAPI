Day 8

Today I almost cracked. I was sitting with my brother in a goose blind (its hunting season here) and he was smoking away on his du Maurier lights. I had been down there with him for about 4 hours and finally asked if I could have one.

As he passed me the lighter I thought about all I went through to get this far and all those that supported me. I felt so guilty that I handed him back the lighter and the smoke.

It was a breakthrough for me that I owe the time and progress that I have made not only to myself but to all those that have encouraged and been patient with me. I need to get through this and not fail.

Haven't checked on this sub for a while. Holy crap it's been 165 days!

Feels freaking awesome.  Not much cravings.  Every so often I get a whiff of a someone else smoking and it smells good but usually it disgusts me.  The worst cravings I get is when I have a beer or two.  Drinking beer and smoking was my way of relaxing after work for way too long.  But have majorly cut back on drinking too and when I do it's usually a mixed drink now.  Keep up with it.  You all can do it!

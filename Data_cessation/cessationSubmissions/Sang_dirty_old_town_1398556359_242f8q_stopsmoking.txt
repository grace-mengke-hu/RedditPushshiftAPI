5 days smoke free after a collapsed lung

So I haven't smoked since Tuesday since a collapsed lung sent me to the emergency room and lung surgery. I'm done with cigarettes for good. Honestly enough I need to be for health reasons but I'm hoping that I can stick to it. 

25 years and a spontaneous pneumothorax. Cigarettes definitely contributed to this. I've tried to quit before but I'm done for good now.

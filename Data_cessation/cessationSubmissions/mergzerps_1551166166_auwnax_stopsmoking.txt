Smoker’s Flu?

I’m on my third day of quitting and my god, I have the most unbelievable cough and congestion right now. I’m torn between smoker’s flu and pneumonia, it’s that goddamn bad. My lungs feel like they’re on fire. I can’t sleep, the cough sounds like an infant with fucking whooping cough. Has anyone ever experienced this? It seems pretty severe and of course the only thing I can find is on smoker’s flu but that seems to be a walk in the park compared to this shit. Trying to discern whether I should head to the walk-in or just ride this out. But my god do I never want to pick up a cigarette again, the thought of smoking right now is making my lungs bleed.

I want to stop. I really do. But I'm terrified of a lifetime of feeling I'm going without.

I'm going to have my last cigarette in a minute, maybe the 17th time I've said that. I can never get past day 4. I'm just terrified of the feeling of missing out for my entire life, even though I know it's my nicotine addiction talking. I'm not looking for a response here, I just want to shout into the void.

How to get my parents to stop smoking?

Both of my parents smoke, they have since they were teenagers, and it doesn't seem like they have any thoughts about quitting. I'm not exactly against smoking, I generally don't mind people smoking, but we can't afford for them to smoke. Neither of them work, my dad has some medical issues that stop his ability to work, and my mum is looking for a job, so we don't have a lot of money to spare, but I wouldn't say we're poor. Don't get me wrong, they're nice people, they're just very stuck in their ways.
 
This is the main reason I want them to stop smoking, but I can't seem to convince them that we would save so much money if they did at least try to stop. So, any suggestions how I can get them to try?

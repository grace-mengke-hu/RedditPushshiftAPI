Quiting for the second time

Ik how hard it will be. I lasted 8 months last time. Now im smoking 2 packs a day and need to quit for good this time. Ive come to realize i care more about my break ritual than smoking itself.  My me time where i can be alone and relax while i browse the web or watch videos. I need something that i can do idley without thinking like smoking while i enjoy my alone time. Any suggestions? Going to be starting a diet soon too so tea and coffee are off the table since i cant stand either without sugar.

Quit on Sunday, 7/9, under a full moon.

Ok so, I quit today. But I'm smoking now. I had one when I got up, another on the way to work, another at lunch and one on the way home. My fiance and I went out and so we had a few drinks so that's why I'm having one now. My mother also smokes so I can always get one from her. That's a big problem. She's had a rough life (lost her husband, youngest son, and youngest brother) so it's understandable why she has such a hard time quitting. So, these 5 cigarettes I had today were half of what I usually smoke. The rest of the cravings were delt with using nicotine gum or a nicotine lozenge. I also have the patch which I'm thinking of putting on before bed. I'd like to get some kind of vaporizer or one of those gizmos you see everywhere but I have no idea which one to get. I know nothing of vaporizers or smokeless cigarettes or even dabs. What's available for me to use?  I'm halfway thru Allen Carrs book but my reading was from Sept-Dec of last year so I need to finish. I also use the Quit Smoking app I've seen on here. Well, that's my blab so now I have no smokes, access to them downstairs, and am gonna use the app and read the book, but first I'm gonna put on the patch. Tomorrow will be tough because I have none on me and always have a smoke with my coffee, and I like a good freshly ground French pressed coffee.

Have you had an addiction transfer? How did you deal with it?

Since I quit I have gained a lot of weight.  I'm now hovering between 235-240 and have been for over a year.  But I am eating the same way that I smoked before.  Even if I'm not hungry, I grab something and start eating.  Or if I'm full, I keep eating because I don't want to waste what is left.  Sometimes it is practically an unconscious thing, like reaching for a cigarette and lighting up without thinking about it.  
  
I can maintain my current weight with exercise, but I don't have the time or inclination to become an exercise nut and burn more than my daily/weekly intake consistently.

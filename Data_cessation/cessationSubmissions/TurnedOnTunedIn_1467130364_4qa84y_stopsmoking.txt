After 10 years,I'm one week and two days, and I want to die. How do you cope?

I'm less angry towards others at this point. I'm more angry at myself for starting. I don't really crave them anymore but I do crave them, All the time! Is it worth the madness!?

Please tell me how you coped? The e cig sucks. Candy is too sweet. I dread my coffee now (I'm a coffee roaster,it's my love)

Please help me.

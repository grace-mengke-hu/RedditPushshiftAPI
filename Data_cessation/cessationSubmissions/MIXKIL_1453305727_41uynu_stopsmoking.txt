I was going to post this earlier.

Hi,

I was on this sub earlier for the first time with my hand hovering over the New Text Post button. I need help quitting and I'm finding it so difficult. I never thought I was addicted and this is a wake up call. I didn't post anything in the end, and went out and bought cigarettes. After having one, I felt okay, I wasn't scared or panicky any more. But I did feel regret and guilt.

I just need a bit of encouragement, or a reality check or something that makes me need to stop. I really can't carry on smoking.

Sorry if this doesn't follow the etiquette of this sub, first time poster.

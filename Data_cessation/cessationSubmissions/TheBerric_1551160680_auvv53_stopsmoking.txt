I’m having a really bad craving right now. I don’t know what to do.

I’m 8 days off smoking right now. It’s almost 10:00pm and my girlfriend just left my apartment. I feel alone and I have an incredible urge to smoke. I tried to see if maybe my friends would come over to have a beer but they were all busy. For some reason, in my head, I can’t justify quitting. I can’t seem to convince myself that it’s worth it 100%. I read all of the statistics and I have so many issues related to smoking. It still doesn’t get through my fucking head. I am having a weak moment right now and I don’t know what to do.

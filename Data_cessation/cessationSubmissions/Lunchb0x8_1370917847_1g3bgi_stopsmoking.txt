I quit last week... this week it has all gone to crap.

I had my last cigarette at 3pm on Thursday 6/6/2013

I got into work this morning, first day back since long weekend and an RDO had me at home for the last 4 days.

We had a major server and our storage controller crash, and everything else that can go wrong, is.

I am struggling here, but my plan is to head out, grab a sandwich for lunch and perhaps go for a walk around an oval...

Thanks /r/stopsmoking/ I know I can make it, just frustrated at the moment.

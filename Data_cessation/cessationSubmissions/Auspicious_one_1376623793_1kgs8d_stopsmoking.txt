73 Days. Road rage. Stupid people rage. Coping.

I haven't touched a cig since I read Allen Carr's book on June 3rd.

After the first week it is pretty easy. I am sailing now. I NEVER thought I would be able to quit after smoking for 10 years. I am now biking 10-30 miles a day. I am a mile high above sea level. I am feeling good, and wanting to be healthy now.

But I find that I used to cope with road rage, slow people, stupid people and general times were patience is needed with a cigarette. (sorry to sound bitter and miserable, but this is just generally when I am driving or getting groceries and such)

Has anyone had problems coping with rage/patience situations like I have?

Alright guys, day 2 of no weed or cigs. I am feeling antsy!

I had to do it. It was taking over my life and only making me feel worse. Sneaking out during the day to get high or smoke a cig. Smoking bowls while driving, overeating, being lazy and feeling like my lungs are full of ash. I want my life back and so far so good. Was able to have a few beers and not smoke! Big step

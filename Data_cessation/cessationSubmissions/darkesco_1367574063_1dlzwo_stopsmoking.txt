30 Days smoke free! Previous pack a day smoker for 15+ years. Not one craving, very very very mild withdrawal once or twice! What's the secret?

Drugs! Drugs are the answer! I used Chantix for about 3 weeks and have not smoked in 30 days. Super easy. Before this I failed at quitting over 20 times. I wish I had not tortured myself like that so many times just to fail and go back to smoking. I have a real chance of quitting for life and I owe that to Chantix. THANK YOU SCIENCE! :) :)

My first smoke-free day

I've been smoking about a pack a day for 15 years. At my peak consumption, I was smoking two packs a day. 10 years ago, I quit for about two weeks while using the patch, but quickly fell back into old habits when I visited some friends. I have smoked every day since then. Until yesterday!

I was often able to cut down significantly, often with the help of an e-cig, but was always smoking at least three a day, usually more. The last half of January, I struggled with quitting. For the past few weeks, I'd convince myself every pack I bought would be my last, but every day that I woke up without cigarettes, I'd cave and go buy more. I had nicotine gum and my vapor pen, and they helped with cravings, but I would go buy cigarettes anyway. It was frustrating because I knew I had the strength to say no, but I would choose to smoke anyway. Put quitting off for just a few more days.

On January 28th, after another failed attempt, I decided I would quit on February first. I spent the night before with my boyfriend, and after smoking my bedtime cigarette, I handed the rest of the pack to my boyfriend, who hid them from me. In the morning, I vaped away my craving, and on my way home, chewed a piece of gum instead of stopping to buy a new pack. 

I stayed busy all day, drank a ton of liquids, and used the vapor pen and gum as needed through the day. It wasn't terrible. I'm dealing with it one craving at a time, one day at a time, but for the first time in 10 years, I have made it a whole day without a cigarette, and that is a huge victory. I was always wanting to quit, trying to quit, or "quitting" (cutting back to a quit date that never came). Now I feel like I can finally say that I quit. I've still got a long road ahead of me, cutting out all nicotine products, but I'm on my way and I can't wait to get there!

TL;DR: It was a struggle to get here, but I had my first 100% smoke free day in a decade. I am no longer a smoker. I can do this.

I need help quitting

Hey everyone. I have known about this reddit page for a while now but it's only been recent that I decided I want to fight this urge to constantly smoke. Im 21 now and been smoking since 18 but the past 5 months has been the worse for me. I almost smoke a pack a day. I enjoy sitting on my patio to take a break from whatever I'm doing every now and then and enjoy a cig. I work graveyard shifts and it helps me stay awake during the slowest times of my shift. I have built so many habits around my life that fits smoking comfortably and I love it! Even when I don't love smoking cigarettes (usually high from weed) I find a way to tell myself I'm enjoying it. 

The biggest reason I want to quit smoking is that I lost my dad before I was old enough to know him to lung cancer and he was only 51. He was taken from me too soon and I got a tattoo of "Forever in my heart [his name]" with a cancer awareness ribbon next to it. If he were to see me now he would be so ashamed of me smoking cigarettes regularly with that tattoo as a reminder of me losing him.

Sorry I am providing a lot of information but I just want a community to belong to that struggles like I do. I know I'm not that old but my addiction has gotten worse and my habits are changing. I need to quit for the sake of my new born nephew.

Day 36 and I can sing again!

One more benefit of being an ex-smoker that I didn't realize was even an issue! I love to sing, but I've been so croaky and off key for the past five years, I stopped doing it. Last night I was on a long drive and I was craving a smoke like I used to have while driving (always one of my toughest moments in this quit). I started singing along with the radio to distract myself, and realized all those hoarseness and key problems were gone! What a wonderful feeling, I can't even tell you. On to day 37!

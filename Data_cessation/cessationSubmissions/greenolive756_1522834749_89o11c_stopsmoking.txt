Update: Wife of smoker

So a while back I posted about my husband, who had quit 4 years ago and recently relapsed. We had some tough conversations, but I'm proud to say that he's completely stopped smoking again. 

What helped?

- He reread his copy of Allen Carr

- I was brutally honest with him about how his smoking was affecting me

- Once he stopped, I praised him consistantly and tried to help lessen stress in other areas of his life if possible

It was hard, but we're in a good place again. If you haven't read Allen Carr's books, check them out.

And honesty is, obviously, always best. Good luck.

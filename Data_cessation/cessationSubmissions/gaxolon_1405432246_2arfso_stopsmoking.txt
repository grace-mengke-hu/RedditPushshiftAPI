Quit smoking cigarettes 2 days ago and marijuana 8 days ago!

This week has been a huge changing point in my life. 

I am 22 years old and have been smoking both weed and cigarettes for 10+ years. Both are my only real addictions.. It's been quite a stressful few days with life at normal pace but doesn't feel like I have that release. I have a tight knit group of 9 best friends, everyone smokes in some form or another.. be it fags or weed but I don't want to alienate myself from the group just because I've chosen to be smoke-free.. Any tips on dealing with the social side of things regarding smoking and how have you guys dealt with night's out drinking? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

I have recently just got into a relationship (1 month ago) with a girl I really like who doesn't smoke. I am mainly doing this for myself but she was certainly the kick-up-the-ass I needed to get the ball rolling. 
I am doing this completely cold turkey which I feel is the only way possible for me! I've been reading for this sub quite a bit over the last week and it's great to be able to talk and discuss issues with people going through the same situation. 

Thanks again guys and I hope this is the start of clean air future for myself.

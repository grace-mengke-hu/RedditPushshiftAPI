Day 3

Today is day 3, cold turkey.  I've quit in the past, but have had a hard time staying quit after the first week or so.  I just wanted to say thanks to everyone here.   I've been pretty quiet, but I've been reading all the posts.  It's nice to know there are other people in the same place as me.  I'll keep looking here for support.  

I'm feeling pretty determined after an acquaintance of mine was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer two weeks ago.  I am & always have been aware of the risks of smoking, but you always think you're the invincible one.... It's time to stop and take control of this once & for all.

And I can smell it again. I went into Walgreens yesterday & walked past a  pair of smokers... the smoke smell radiating from these two was nauseating.  There is no way I would have noticed a week ago.

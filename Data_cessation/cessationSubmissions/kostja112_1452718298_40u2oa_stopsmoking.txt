Reaching for the stars!

I am so grateful to all of you people. For the last year every thought  about those nasty cigarettes instead of smoking I would visit this sub. If someone else can do it, then so can I thought.

Its been a long journey. By this point I don't even think about nicotine, that's why I missed my 1 year date.

Obligatory Allen Carr's easy way pitch here. Read the book, really thought about it and it was really easy. 

To fellow quitters: Imagine yourself before smoking, how did you live without nicotine and pursue that lifestyle, because you no longer need nicotine, in fact you didn't even had the need for it in the first place. Your brain just made itself believe that there must be a reason, why you smoke [insert amount here] a day. Now that you no longer smoke you have to convince your brain that there was no reason behind it.

As for me. I no longer believe lies I told myself:

"Everyone has white teeth, but mine are naturally more yellow"

"I don't smell that bad, I can't smell anything on my clothes right now"

"Only small part of my money goes towards my addiction"

And much much more. Now I can go out to restaurant and actually enjoy eating for 30 minutes or a hour. I no longer have the rush to go smoking. 


Everyone can do it! I believe in you all!

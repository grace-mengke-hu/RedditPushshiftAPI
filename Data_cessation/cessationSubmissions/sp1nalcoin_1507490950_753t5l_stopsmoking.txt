Quit 5 days ago. Non-stop cravings

I got tonsillitis 1 week ago. I haven't smoked since then. 5-6 days smoke free so I though I could use this occasion to quit for good (once again).

Now I am getting better and I have constant cravings. I try to eat to stop the cravings but that makes them even worse because I love to smoke after a meal. This is horrible I cant think about anything else.

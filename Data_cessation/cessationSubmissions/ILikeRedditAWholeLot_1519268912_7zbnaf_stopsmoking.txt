Question about food.

So I've heard a million times  just like everyone that when you quit, your senses of taste and smell are amplified. So purely out of curiosity will my sensitivity to strong flavors decrease as well? I can handle most any spicy food you can throw at me, I've eaten umeboshi (really sour plum) without blinking an eye, I love large amounts of vinegar, mustard, garlic and all manner of tart, acidic or otherwise intense flavors. Is that gonna go away to some degree when I quit smoking? Also don't know if this is related but absolutely zero sweet tooth. I can have one bite of a brownie and that will last me for 6 months. No candy or soda or anything like that for me.

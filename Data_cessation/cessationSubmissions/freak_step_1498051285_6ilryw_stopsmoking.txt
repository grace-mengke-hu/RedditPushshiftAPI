Nicotine patches and the Smoke Free App

Hi all,

Does anyone know the best way to configure the smoke free app if you used nicotine patches to step down? I'm on day 3 of no patches (after doing the 6 week step down treatment) and I'm not sure if I should set my quit date to 3 days or 6 weeks and 3 days ago.

My biggest concern is having accurate health improvement meters. I don't care about the badges as I'm never smoking again so I'll earn them all eventually. It's not clear what categories are affected by tobacco/cigarettes and what is is affected by nicotine. For example, the "Tooth Staining" and "Gums and Teeth" categories seem like they'd be affected more by tobacco than nicotine where as blood circulation is not totally clear.

It's been hard to find any good information via google of the effects of just nicotine vs tobacco + nicotine.

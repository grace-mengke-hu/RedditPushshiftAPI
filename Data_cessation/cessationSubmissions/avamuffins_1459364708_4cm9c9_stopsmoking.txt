Hi. I am on day 3 of no smoking and it's been very hard!

I've been smoking since 15 and a pack a day for the past 5 years. I got a sinus infection recently and didn't smoke for a day and decided to see how long I could go. It's been very hard. I think the hardest part for me is the social aspect. Like I miss going to the smoking section at work and talking with all the other smokers. And like talking to people at bars. I know it's not worth it. But yeah that's my biggest struggle!

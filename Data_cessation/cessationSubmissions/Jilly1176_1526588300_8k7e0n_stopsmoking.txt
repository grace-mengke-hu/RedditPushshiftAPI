4 days in!

I have quit more than once, one time for 10 yrs! But Iâ€™m tired of feeling like crap, tired of being terrified to die and leave my kids to be raised by my awful ex and his even worse girlfriend-and tired of smelling like an ashtray... but like all of you I love my butts!!! Iâ€™m just exhausted, feeling so sluggish and actually feel like my lungs hurt more than when i was smoking... the cravings at times have been unbearable but pushing through.,. Just assuming this is all normal?

Thanks for the support ðŸ˜Š

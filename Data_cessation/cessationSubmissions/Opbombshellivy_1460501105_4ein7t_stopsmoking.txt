I survived a big outdoor all day event yesterday. And it didn't even phase me!

Last year a 2 week quit was brought down by opening day. This year I honestly wasn't phased. I walked away from the groups that started smoking together, I wasn't bothered and giggled when people asked me for a lighter. It was fine. I was fine. I didn't miss out on anything. I was enjoying the beautiful day with my friends, I watched more of the ball game because i didn't have to run off to the secluded smoking section at the ball park. It was an awesome day.

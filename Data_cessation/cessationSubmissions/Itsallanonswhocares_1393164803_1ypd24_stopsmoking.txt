Everything in my life is falling apart, and I'm still going strong. To those in hard times, keep on keeping on, don't let a temporary moment of weakness get you down!

I'm depressed, anxious, and am getting to a point where I can't feel a damn thing because my mind alternates between anxiety to a point where I can't sleep or focus, before my depression drops my mood so low that I can't feel any emotions other than a dull sense that I'm wasting my life and it's all my fault. 

I'm barely functioning, and I'm trying to clean up my life, I've quit smoking a while ago and I'm trying to get clean and take better care of myself, it's slow going and I'm barely making any progress. But any day that passes without me lighting up is another day under my belt and another day in the right direction.

I'm trying to say that you guys can do it and I believe in you, if a fuckup like me can manage y'all sure as hell can too!

Back to day 1

I just threw 5 days and 12 hours down the drain. I smoked a cuban cigar I had sitting in my room.

The physical cravings were gone, I had beat that, but I realize I have no idea how to handle stress and anxiety without cigarettes. The way I dealt with stress was to smoke. Today something really bad happened in my life and I tried all day to handle it properly but I couldn't. I got drunk and smoked the cuban and now I'm back to square one.

If I am going to have any chance of success I am going to need to learn how to handle my anxiety and stress properly. Any tips are welcome.

Waiting for badgebot to update my badge.

Just a setback, but I am going to try again tomorrow. It sucks because I was feeling really good and things were getting easier, and I threw it away. I feel awful right now.

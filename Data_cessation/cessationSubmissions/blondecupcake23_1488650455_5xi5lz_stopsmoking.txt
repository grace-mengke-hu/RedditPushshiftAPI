Day #5 is the worst thing ever

Ugh. I don't know if I'll make it today. Since waking up despite seeing the great progress on my quit smoking app all I want is a cigarette. I was even bartering with myself about a black and mild instead. I hate this. I feel so empty inside likemy stomach feels empty and I just want to make it feel better with a little nicotine. I am sitting outside my friends house now about to go in for a baby shower and all I can selfishly think about is smoking and how stressful and social I need to be now and I don't want to. Sigh sometimes I just feel like nicotine has got me hooked for life

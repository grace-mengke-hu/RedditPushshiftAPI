I've spent more days NOT smoking this year than I have spent full-time smoking. That's a win.

I've been trying to fully quit for the past 2 years. I tried everything I could possibly think of instead of actually wanting to quit.

I'd spend 2 weeks not smoking, doing things and getting my shit together, and then spend a weekend doing nothing smoking 3 packs a cigarette. My biggest trigger is boredom, the idea of "well there's nothing to do so I might as well do the thing I do when there's nothing to do: smoke cigarettes which makes me want to do nothing."

I will tell you this: even doing NOTHING is better when you're not a smoker. Smoking doesn't cure boredom-it creates lethargy which leads you to sit around and do nothing for long enough that you get upset about it and you smoke again because you're upset.

Thank you to the redditor who's name I forget that uploaded a PDF of Allen Carr's book. After I read it, I "got" it, but wasn't ready. I went back to smoking.

After that, I bought the audiobook. I listened to it, but wasn't ready, and went back to smoking after two weeks.

After that, something just kind of clicked. I said I'll smoke my last cigarette Monday. I was hungover from the night before. At 2:30pm I lit a cigarette and realized I had choked it down while also trying not to throw up because I had smoked so many that day.

"Just get it in me."

Man am I so happy to be done with this.

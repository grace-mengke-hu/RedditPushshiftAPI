ha ha ha! 6 months!

well, well, what do you know... i've been quit for 6 months now... feel sort of okay, occasional shortness of breath and all that, but boy, life is a million times better than it was before.

i've also spent a bit of time with folks who smoke, and have been offered the occasional cigarette by the oblivious. haven't taken any of them up on their offers.

i still get the occasional craving. i don't know if it's a craving as much as it is a piece of nostalgia (hmmm, a few months ago, i would have smoked while driving by here). i sometimes feel like taking a drag from somebody or borrowing a smoke and seeing what it feels like, but have been staying strong.

i think of smoking around once or twice each day, still. have had one or two smoking nightmares in the past couple of months.

met my doctor for an annual physical last week. all's well, generally.

the only thing that's totally screwed up is heartburn. have had this for a few years, but it's much worse after quitting smoking. medication hasn't helped much, and neither has diet.

Weightgain, Erections, and E-cigs

Im 14 days out now longest run I ever had and honestly it is not nearly as hard for me now as it has been in the past (I think because for the first time I went into this expecting to beat it!). I have three questions for you guys who might know more than me about all of this. 

First I know gaining weight seems to be inevitable (still really really pissing me off but better than early death!) and I'm wondering...is this because quitters eat more from the increased appetite or is it more of a body chemistry/metabolism thing. I guess more to the point if I moderate my eating habits (actually doing that BETTER now than I was before...guess im more motivated now) can I avoid this or will I still get some of it?

To add to that topic, I have started using E-Ciggarettes to help with this (I was good without them till I started drinking again but instead of breaking to a real smoke I got these and it helps amazingly well!) and I am wondering if the aforementioned weight effects stemmed from the nicotine itsself or if it was another chem in the smokes? If the prior then will my use of the Electric one stave off the gains?

Last question, pertaining the e-cigarettes and nicotine effects. When I stopped within days I found myself getting more spontaneous and harder erections. A very welcome effect but I am wondering about its cause. I was also a heavy drinker and cut out for a bit on the day I quit smoking. 7 days later I started drinking again (when i got the Ecig) so I introduced nicotine and alcohol back into my body. Ive noticed a reduction in erections again (although still better than before) and I was wondering if this is an effect of the Nicotine or if it is more likely to be the alcohol.

Thank's for reading through this and helping out and stay strong guys :)

Just finished my last cigarette

I've read through a few of these posts and so much of it resonates with how I feel.  I've tried to quit previously a few times but have had set backs mostly due to this feeling at one point that "what's the point, I'm just a smoker and that I need to just accept it".  i don't want to accept that though.

I really need to keep the goal in mind as I go through what will be the last time I quit.  I'm currently reading the Allen Carr book which was recommended to me and plan to use nicotine patches during the day to fight urges from work stress.  I'm hoping changes I'm making to my lifestyle like swimming, eating healthier and giving mediation a try will help me feel better about myself and deal with this change in my life.

I've always hid smoking from my parents and girls I've dated so I'm excited that I will no longer have to constantly worry about febrezing my clothes and apartment, using aftershave to mask the smoke smell, keeping Listerine at my desk at work (I probably just smell like the cleaning section of a store) and still constantly stress about being discovered as a smoker.

I love that this community exists because I really feel like I could use the support and look to those on here that are going through the same challenge.  I want to ask whether people think it would be worth admitting to those I've hid this from, that I am a smoker and I am trying to quit?  Is it worth it?

To anyone else that's reading this and currently beginning to quit, please keep it up.  Keep in mind your goal and how much happier you will be down the road being a non-smoker.  I don't want to wish you good luck because you have this.

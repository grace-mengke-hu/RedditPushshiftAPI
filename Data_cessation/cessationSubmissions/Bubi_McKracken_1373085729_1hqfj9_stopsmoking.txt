Just quit after my 4th of July celebration.

I have been smoking for almost 7 years. Only half-assedly tried to quit a few times. The tax increase and health reasons have finally encouraged me to really go for it. I don't necessarily crave the nicotine, but it's more of the ritual of smoking. Hoping to find some support and ideas for not relapsing.

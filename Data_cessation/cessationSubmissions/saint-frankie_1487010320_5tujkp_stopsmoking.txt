Over a month and it's time to clean house.

I wear leather a lot, I have for years. Leather jacket, belt, boots, gloves. 

The smell of stale smoke won't fade. I have hung four jackets up in the garage, tried every thing. They smell like ash trays.

All I can think is, "Dear god, did I smell like that? How could people stand to be around me???" There's a hoarder in me that doesn't want to get rid of those jackets. Some of them I've had for over a decade - almost as long as I smoked. The years and years of smoke and cigarettes and butts in my pockets has forever stained them with memories of that disgusting habit.

So I'm tossing them. See ya! 

As for other updates?

I work out twice a day to keep my energy levels down. I feel hyper, happy, light, and nearly manic at times. 6 hours of sleep every night is enough to keep me amped for the entire next day. My sex drive is through the roof. My skin looks better. My hair is growing faster. I can breathe! My lips feel softer - I hadn't realized how dry they were all the time. 

My body smells better. When I sweat at the gym it smells sweeter. My morning breath isn't awful. My mouth doesn't feel dry and worn out. I can taste more. Less salt needed in my cooking.

Damn, life is great.

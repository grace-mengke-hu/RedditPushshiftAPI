110 cigarettes not smoked

To me, that is almost more amazing than being 3 weeks in. I wasn't a pack a day smoker, usually 5 to half a pack. My worst days were when I would binge smoke while out at a bar, usually going through a whole pack in a few hours. But still, 110 seems like such a large number of smokes for 3 weeks that I would have absentmindedly puffed away at. The $30 I've saved doesn't hurt either.

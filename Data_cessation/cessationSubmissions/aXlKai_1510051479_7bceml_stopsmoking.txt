Failed after 3 days - wtf happened?

Hi all,

I feel ashamed - after three days of non-smoking I failed. I kinda couldn't control myself :/ 

For three days I had no problems not even that much of cravings. Only feelings were like - "Hack, now I would have a smoke... naaah I don't need it. I feel good this way". And that was it.

I use NRT patches so I am thinking what I could do wrong this morning:
1) I tried to delay the patch, after shower
2) Previous night I slept too much maybe? I slept 9 hours and still I felt I could use more.
3) After the shower I applied the patch on my hip (previously on a chest side). Somewhere around belt area on the side.

I went for work but I felt something is wrong - I couldn't control myself and despite trying to fight the urge I was like ... on autopilot, no mantra helped, reasons to quit telling to myself didnt work nothing... I just went to closest cig shops and bought a pack. Smoked one immediately. It was disgusting even after so few days... 

4 hours later....

And just about now I ran to work from home rather than sit in the office going crazy and I smoked 2 on my way home... 

I just ... I just feel ashamed and weak. Wanna try tomorrow again :/

Still I don't think these three days were a waste.. I already felt better, breathing better, no cold feet or fingers... and if it isn't too much to say I even felt more blood flow to my ... buddy :) Will I ever be able to quit for good? What did I do wrong? Ever been there that you are not thinking and you are going for cigs irrationally? Like ... nothing helped.

If I may, I will let you know how my second start is going.

Thanks for any answer.

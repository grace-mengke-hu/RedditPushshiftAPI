I'm in the TDC!

I just wanted to boast a little about how proud I am that I am now in the Triple Digits Club!  100 days smoke free!  I am finally starting to feel the mental hold cigarettes had on me slipping.  I definitely still think about smoking at certain times but within the last couple weeks especially I feel like things are finally smoothing out.  Keep up the good work everyone!  Next stop--the QDC!!!

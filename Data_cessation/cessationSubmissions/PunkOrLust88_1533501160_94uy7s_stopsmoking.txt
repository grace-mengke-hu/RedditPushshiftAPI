Help!!

Hello, made an account just to post here.  30-years-old, went my whole teen years without being a smoker, never ever thought I’d become one but got hooked at 22 when my ex-girlfriend was a smoker; she’s long gone but the habit remains.   As someone who’s been pretty depressed and anxious for the last decade or so, someone who is generally neurotic and unhappy with life, smoking has always been my emotional crutch.  I genuinely love smoking and everything about it, it has always provided me comfort and peace when I’ve needed it the most and I just hate the idea of giving that up.  Between the cost and my constant sinus problems, I know I need to quit but I’m so desperate and scared to do so.   I read Allen Carr’s book, and was motivated to quit for a few hours, but soon afterwards, I started lighting up again.

As pathetic as it is, deep down I feel like I need cigarettes to survive and I will never truly be happy or feel fulfilled without them.  Any other smokers here using their vice as a distraction for the larger issues at hand, whether it’s mental illness or a general apathy towards life?  I’ve been kind of feeling like cigarettes are all I’ve got to pass the time and get by with, but I’m sure that’s the addiction talking, and I’ll be much better off without them in the long-run.  I’m just so anxious to take that first step, hard to stay motivated in the moment, and I’m struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don’t want to use nicotine substitutes because it seems counterproductive if I’m trying to rid myself of my addiction by just replacing it with the same drug.   Hoping to quit after this last pack but not feeling too hopeful.

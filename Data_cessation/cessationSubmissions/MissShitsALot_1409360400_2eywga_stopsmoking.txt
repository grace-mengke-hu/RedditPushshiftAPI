Diagnosed with COPD yesterday at 30 years old... halfway through my first day.

This is extremely tough. 

After a very long conversation with my doctor yesterday, I came home and told my boyfriend my diagnosis. Spent the rest of the evening smoking my remaining cigarettes because I was done for good, regardless.

This morning was manageable...but I've been seriously struggling the rest of the day. I have bought sunflower seeds & lollipops to get me through the 1st 72 hours... but I also spent $50 at a discount store just trying to distract myself until the craving passed.

I have broken out in sweats a couple times today and can feel another coming on.

I want to do this. I want to be successful. I don't want to suffer from any more ailments because of cigarettes. 

I wish I could just sleep the next couple of days until this was out of my system.

Just flushed the unopened pack I bought tonight and the one I was working on. First time posting... Gonna need help with this one.

So I've "quit" before a couple times. At least once was for almost 6 months. But, they never stuck. I think because I wasn't totally sure I wanted to. I know the health risks, but as a 24 year old who has only been smoking since I was 18, it all seemed superficial to me.

But when I tried to quit a few months ago, I did alright, then gave up. And the next thing I knew, I was over a pack a day. Ever since then, I've actually felt a desire to kick this habit.

I noticed today that I'm getting sick and my throat has been so messed up that I'm basically choking through each cig. So here goes, and hopefully this time's for good!

BTW: any advice, encouragement and reassurance is VERY appreciated. Thanks ahead of time!

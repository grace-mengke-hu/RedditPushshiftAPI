Back on the horse (yet again)

Two days, five hours. That's better than two days of smoking. This is my zillionth quit this summer but I always have faith. 

Currently sitting in a hospital waiting room (nothing scary, just tests) next to someone who smokes. I have to remember this is what others smelled when I sat next to them. 

Maybe we should all keep a scarf or a t-shirt in a zipplock to smell when tempted.

Dream about smoking?

I have had very few cravings to smoke.  On occasion when I'm drinking or when I experience a very stressful day I have the urge but I can always fight it.  

A handful of times I've found myself dreaming and within the dream I end up taking a puff of a cigarette and IMMEDIATELY I regret it and end up waking up.  Just wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar occurrence.

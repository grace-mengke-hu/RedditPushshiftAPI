trying to quit smoking, fucking pissed right now.

God damn Dr told me i am in the beginning stages of emphysema.  He gave me some patches but they are barely scratching the surface.  Everything is making me want to rage right now.

How long does this shit last

EDIT - I think this spell is over guys.  Hopefully no one minds me coming on here and blowing up randomly.  I dont want to get angry at my family for my bad habits.  Finding some outlet to have a shit fit on might be a good thing.

have patience and bear with me

Feeling superior

Hi /r/stopsmoking, I've reached 154 days today, and while the number of days isn't exactly a milestone, today I was at a coffee house with my friend, and as smoking was prohibited he went outside in the rain to have a smoke. I stayed inside and read a chapter of my book feeling superior than him (not in a bad way of course!). 

Smoking isn't even an option for me, I've just deleted it from my life, and I'm happy that I don't even get mental cravings anymore.

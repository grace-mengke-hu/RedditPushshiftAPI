Going to the doctors and assessing a damage

Any of you long term non smokers go to a doctor to get some tests done? I would like to go and get everything checked out, but I am not sure what. I know for a fact that I want to get stress test done on my heart, but what about lungs? Would simple xray do? blood work? I want to make sure everything is ok inside there. 

Any suggestions?

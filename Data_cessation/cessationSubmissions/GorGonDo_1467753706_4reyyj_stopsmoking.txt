Starting all over again

So I have been trying to quit for a while (this is at least the 3rd time this year) and I feel the best about this time. I just found this subreddit maybe a week ago and it spurred me on to try it again this time. Thanks everyone for posting your successes here. Hopefully I can join you all.

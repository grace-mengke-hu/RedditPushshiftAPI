Patulous Eustachian Tube Problems

Hello guys, I am a tiny bit underweight, nothing too worrying but that causes some problems with patulous eustachian tube. Mostly when dehydrated or excercising. I am quitting at the moment, but  I now have pretty much constant patulous eustachian tube, even when sitting at work. It is very frustrating and makes me want to start again. Has anyone had this? Knows how to stop it? I assume it will fade over time, but this is very annoying.

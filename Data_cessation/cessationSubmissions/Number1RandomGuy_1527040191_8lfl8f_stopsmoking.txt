What is the point if quitting???

I've been smoking 2 packs daily now for the last 7 years, started at 18 and now I am 25...

I always get badgered by everyone to quit, but what is the point?

The only reason would be so I don't get cancer, but I won't get cancer if I quit 5\-10 years from now when I'm 30\-35 years old....

So what is the point?....It's not like I don't have the money either.

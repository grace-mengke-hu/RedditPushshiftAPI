1 month in and I’m having crazy withdrawals, never tried quitting before so need to know if the withdrawals are really this bad.

1) I have massive anxiety and smoking used to calm my nerves now I’ve had 2 panic attacks in the last month

2) Extreme nausea that comes and goes, usually when its there it lasts the whole day and is typically the worst in the morning 

3) Fatigue: literally everyday 

4) Dry mouth which only started happening after I reached one month of my smoking cessation and no amounts of water helps sooth my throat or mouth

5) Insomnia: I used to get a good 8 hours of sleep when I was a smoker now i wake up within 5-6 hours of sleep and cannot go back to sleep?

Those are my symptoms and I feel like shit, I really never felt like this way before in my life and just want to know if these symptoms are normal or if I should consult a doctor thanks.

Quit for 5 days, just relapsed, feeling frustrated

I'm 22, been smoking for about a year, smoking a half pack a day for the last six months. I've tried to quit before but never lasted for more than a day or two. This time around I told myself this was it. Cravings have been terrible, I feel like I'm about to jump out of my skin, I'm super edgy and irritable, and I keep feeling like I'm about to cry for no reason. All I can think about is how badly I want to smoke. It feels like I'm super thirsty and I'm telling myself I have to go the rest of my life without a sip of water. After not smoking for five days I caved in and bought another pack, smoked two cigarettes and threw the rest in a dumpster. I'm feeling really discouraged and disappointed in myself. I guess I'm wondering if any of y'all have any tips for how to make it past the cravings of the first week or two. I'd also be interested to hear how long it took for the strong desire to smoke to go away. Any advice/words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for all of you out there working on quitting keep up the good work, you're not alone out there.

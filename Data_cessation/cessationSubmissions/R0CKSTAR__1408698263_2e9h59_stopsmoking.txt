Day 4 starting feeling really good but weekend starting ...

Sup guys, 

as the Title says Day 4 is coming and I'm feeling really good ! :) But also kinda worried because the weekend is about to start and we are celebrating a birtday of a friend so if I survive this Night i will survive any.  :)

Btw, is there any other feeling the same as me? Like If im feeling weak and feeling in need for a cig i just come to this subreddit, read myself a bit thorugh and then my cravings are gone. :p 

But I also feel that the cravings are starting to become more intense. E.g first day after waking up it was no problem to not smoke but now it is getting really hard but as said above i will stand this and become a Ex smoker. 

Even hooked up with my ex gf yesterday and told her to brush her teeth since the smell of the cigarette was disgusting.

Just wanted to say thanks for giving me motivation to stop and everything, you guys rock !

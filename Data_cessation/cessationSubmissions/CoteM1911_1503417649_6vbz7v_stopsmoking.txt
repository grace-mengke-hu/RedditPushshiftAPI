When does the coughing go away?

I already posted today but forgot to ask. When does the coughing stop? I know that can be part of the quit but it's so annoying. I'm coughin up garbage and have a tickle in my throat almost constantly. I feel totally fine otherwise, just annoyed at the mucusy bullshit. Just wondering what the normal time frame is for this aggravation.

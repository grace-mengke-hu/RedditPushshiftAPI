Feeling sick, fatigued, dizzy. 5 days smoke free. Normal?

Hi guys. Today is the fifth day since I quit smoking cold turkey. I felt pretty good the first 3 days but yesterday I had nausea, felt tired and my stomach was doing backflips with little to no desire to eat. Today I feel very tired, dizzy and have nausea again. Is this normal?!

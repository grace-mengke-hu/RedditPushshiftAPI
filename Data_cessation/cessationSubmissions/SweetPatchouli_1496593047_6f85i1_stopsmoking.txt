We should try to remember...


Quitting smoking is not easy. It’s exhausting at times, and there are mood swings and mind games 
But, we need to remember people have failed time and time again, only to persevere and find that they are not only successful, but have become stronger in their journey to living smoke free.

Quitting smoking is not easy, but is it easier that living with or dying from a smoking-related illness.

It can be tiring, but not as tiring as chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

It takes some effort, but not as much effort as it takes some to try to take their next breath.

If you are in your 20’s or 30’s and think you have decades to smoke before you do any real damage, please think again. It is about perspective, and as you progress through this process, your perspective will change. Mine has…for the better and forever.

We have become a society who demands instant gratification, and patience has gone by the wayside. I believe some things are still worth waiting for, and I KNOW that smoke-freedom is one of them. The veterans who stick around here do so because they know how great it feels to be smoke-free.

It does get better, and it does get easier, and you owe it to yourselves to give yourselves however long it takes to feel good about being smoke-free.

So…rant, whine, scream…whatever it takes to get you from where you are to where you want to be, but PLEASE DON’T SMOKE! I promise that quitting smoking will not kill you, and if you let it, it can even be one of the most amazing experiences of your life.

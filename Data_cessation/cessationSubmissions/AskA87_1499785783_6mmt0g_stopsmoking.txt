Trying to quit - once again

So,this is the thing.One year ago i managed to successfully quit smoking using one self-help book that almost magicaly convinced me.Then i found a new gf,she was a smoker and..you know..after sex i started smoking once in a while.Now i am back full force at a pack a day and i have no idea where to start again.But i am willing to give it a shot

Hey, I've been quit for a while now. last week I had a relapse. I met with my ex who brought out lots of emotions I just lost it.I'm also 23 weeks pregnant. But last week I really smoked so much. I've started my quit again today. Could it have affected my baby? He's kicking but I'm really worriedðŸ˜­

Day 3

Hi guys, I'm currently on day 3 of no smoking. It's going very good and I'm having almost no problems with it. The only thing I am noticing is this weird feeling in my body, I can't really explain what the feeling is but it seems like a craving or something. When will these feelings stop coming?

Sliding down the slippery slope of smoking

I officially started quitting on Nov 5 and went until Dec 29 without a cigarette.  Since then, I've smoked eight of them.  I had been doing REALLY well with the quitting before that.  I was committed to the goal and proud of what I had accomplished.  I've been dealing with a lot of emotional pain from love stuff lately, which has certainly been a trigger.  I think I can just smoke one.  Clearly, that's not the case.  How do I get motivated again??  I don't want to smoke, but I can feel myself treading a fine line.  Today is day 1.  Again.

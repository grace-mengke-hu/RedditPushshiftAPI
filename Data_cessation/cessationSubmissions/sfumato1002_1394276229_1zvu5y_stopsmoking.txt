My first star!!!

Cravings are rare now...only under stress sometimes I feel like a cigarette...Most of the time now I don't even think about smoking.

People and friends cannot believe I really quit. My brother who smokes called me a looser for quitting! LOL , He smokes and I think he misses me smoking with him when we see each other...I have been kind of ignoring him these last 30 days!

Anyway, I feel healthier,  i am exercising more and feel really good. I look more rested and healthier too! I am happy I quit. Stay strong!

Fallen off already!

So I decided on Sunday night that I was going to quit. Smoked my last cigarette Sunday night and that was it. Did really well yesterday. No cigarettes and joined the gym! Today however, another story. Slight argument with the boyfriend and I was straight to the shop and smoked. I've only had 1 but feel like an utter utter failure and basically want to cry because I caved in and had one.

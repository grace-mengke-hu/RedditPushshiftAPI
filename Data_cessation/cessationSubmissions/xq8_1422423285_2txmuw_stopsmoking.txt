Alright you crazy bastards, it's on.

To tell you the truth I'm not sure why I quit.  I mean yeah, all the same reasons we all say to ourselves and others.  But I never planned to quit.  It just kind of happened.  It was probably subconscious fear.  Well, whatever it was, it's working so far.  So any tips, tricks and gags you guys have along the way will make it that much more fun- like getting the smell outta my shit so people actually believe me...

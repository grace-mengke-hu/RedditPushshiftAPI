60 days and counting

I have to say without the help of Reddit it would have been a whole lot harder to quit. The support here has been fantastic and I would encourage anyone trying to quit to keep coming back here for inspiration, I know reading through posts helped me immensely and I couldn't be more grateful!

My advice to people just starting out as a pack a day kind of girl for 10 years, it really isn't as hard as you built it up in your mind. It's very obtainable and if you need the assistance of patches, do it! (Being Canadian and living in NWT I know there is government assistance with the cost of the patches if you need it, it's like that for many provinces! So you may want to look into that) 

I just really want to say thank you, thank you so much Reddit!

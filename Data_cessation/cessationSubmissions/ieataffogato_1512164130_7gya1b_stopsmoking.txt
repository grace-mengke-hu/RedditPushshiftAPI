Quitting as an occasional smoker

Anyone have tips for someone who doesn't smoke everyday?
I can go a couple weeks or even a month without smoking. I usually get temptations during intense stress at work or from school. But when I buy a pack I can't smoke just one. I chain smoke over the next couple days until the pack is done. I usually then buy another pack or two until I get sick of them and stop. Had this habit for about 7 years now. Would like to completely quit now.

I messed up

I bought a pack of Camels tonight. Smoked one of them. Got half way through the second one and threw it out. So gross. I quit 3 months ago. I don't know how i used to do it. 

If you're trying to quit, it gets better. Smoking is gross. Cigarettes taste bad. Cigarettes are bad for you. There is no reason to do it. You can quit. For good.

Feel very sick when not smoking.

Hi community,

I have been a chain smoker since 6 years now. I do not like my habit. Although I haven't truly considered quiting, I am a bit scared of doing it. Lately I've been having this problem: 

In general I like to tone down my smoking for the following reason. Often when I wake up and did not smoke the night before my body feels really tired. My lungs hurt and I have problems concentrating. Yesterday I didn't properly look when crossing the street, with stupid consequences to follow. Nothing happened luckily, just an angry driver and a confused me. Holding my attention to a conversation is also difficult. I get a sick feeling from not smoking. And this feeling makes me sacred of quitting in general. Just because it makes me feel so sick, mentally disorientated and physically in strains. I know this should be reason enough to quit. But a smokers mind is more thinking about short term and not the long term. 

After I smoked at least 2 cigarettes the feeling is gone. And I can feel normal again. Unfortunately I feel like I caved to feelings I want to avoid. Which only make it harder every time I feel so sick, because I know the remedy is smoking.

Does anybody else have this feeling? How do I counter it? What should I do?

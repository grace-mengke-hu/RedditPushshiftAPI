My first step has been taken

Hey guys.

I'm a 22 year old guy and have been smoking for 4 years now. I'm tired of feeling like garbage all the time, and I know cigarettes are the cause.

I'll keep this short and sweet, but this morning I made the conscious decision to break this habit. The smokes remaining in my pack have been crushed and thrown away.

I know it will be a difficult time, but I'm ready, able, and willing to call it quits for good.

Any and all advice or encouragement is greatly appreciated.

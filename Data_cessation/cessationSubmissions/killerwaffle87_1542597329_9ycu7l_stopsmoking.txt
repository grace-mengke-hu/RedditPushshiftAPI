1 week down!

Been a smoker for about 3 years, since I was 17. I was on and off, but when I was on... I was on. I managed to quit for about a month and a half earlier this year, but easily dropped back into it. Because I smoke so much while I'm on, I'm giving Chantix a shot and it's been a huge help. Downsides are super weird and vivid dreams, but no nightmares. I hope to be off of it in about 6 weeks. Yesterday and the day before I was shoveling and got out of breath so quickly. I never want that again. It makes sense to an extend because I'm asthmatic, but the smoking has exacerbated the issue so much.

I extend all my support and respect to those who are trying to quit, especially people doing it COLD TURKEY. Regardless, let's keep on doing this!

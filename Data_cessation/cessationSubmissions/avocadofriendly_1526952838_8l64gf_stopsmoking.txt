Lets do this!

I have been a 1 pack smoke since im 16 years old and it became a very importent thing for me. You know i could always smoke doesnt matter how shitty the day was or how stressfull. But this needs to stop. I am feeling worse then ever, my lungs, my throat my breathing. So im going to do this! I got to go to work in 4 hours and have no sleep but im motivated and this subreddit gives me power.

myself and husband down to doctors on Friday for replacements

I was all ready to quit on Saturday, i made it to 10am, i need some kind of replacement nicotine, my will power sucks! but i do not want to be a smoker anymore, i have 2 young boys, and i want to see my grandchildren one day.  
i do not enjoy it anymore, and sure as hell cant afford it ( who can?)   
i managed to quit for 2 years before, so i know i can do it, im not looking forward to it, il be brutally honest. i wish i was looking forward to it, but i have realised that my main reason for smoking  right now is to get that 5 min break from an active 9 month old, so i can combat that, i just hope i dont turn into a super bitch, i dont wanna upset my boys :(  
any advice or well wished would be very welcome  
Thank you

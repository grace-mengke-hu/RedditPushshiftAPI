39 days and counting!

(Ex)smoker of 2 years here.
I stopped abruptly 27th January 2016.
Smoked too many cigs at work. Cue the worst cold I've ever experienced. After 2 and a half weeks at home, coughing constantly and unable to go to the gym, it disappeared. At least the cold made the first weeks really, really easy. Was out with friends this friday and it was surprisingly easy to say no to the several "would you like a smoke?", despite all the alcohol I had devoured. My apetite has returned, and I've kicked it up a notch at the gym, I go there daily, mostly twice a day. My veins seems to be reappearing, too! Feelin' good. Penny for your thoughts?
TL;DR: Easy to stop due to cold. I'm done harming my lungs.

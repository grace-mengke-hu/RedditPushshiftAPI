I didn’t smoke but airport goodbyes

My boyfriend got on a plane today because he’s moving 4400km away. I live in Ontario and he works in BritishColumbia and I never thought Canada was too big until today. Feeling pretty shattered but I didn’t buy smokes in response to all the feelings so that’s good.

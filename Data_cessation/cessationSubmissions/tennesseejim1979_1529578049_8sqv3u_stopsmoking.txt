Ulcerative Colitis and smoking.

I am glad to find this board! I was curious if anyone on here has ulcerative colitis. About 12 years ago i quit smoking. About 3 months later i developed this disease. After many trips to the doctor and losing almost 60 pounds ( not intentionally), the specialist at Vanderbilt said “ you know, we don’t know why, but if you hadn’t of stopped smoking you wouldn’t have gotten sick “. So, bought a pack of smokes on the way home. Cleared up in 3 days and really no flares since. Now I’m almost 40 and ready for life style changes. Want to quit smoking, but every time i do, it starts a flare. Btw, i don’t have prescription coverage and can’t afford the medication. Any advice from anyone out there? The doctors say it seems 2-4 cigs/ day is a good target. I can’t just smoke 2-4 I have a very addictive personality. Thanks 🙏

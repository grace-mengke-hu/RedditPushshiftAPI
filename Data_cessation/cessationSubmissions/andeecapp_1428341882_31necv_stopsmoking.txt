Feeling great at one year!

First, the most relevant gif: http://i.imgur.com/8Wi6O.gif

Secondly, a note to all my /r/stopsmoking friends:

Thanks for everything. In the beginning, I was here every day, commiserating, cheering others on, or asking questions. While my visits are less frequent now, I still stop back for encouragement and motivation sometimesâ€”or to just come check in.

If you're starting your journey: Don't give up. Just keep trying. Even if you slip up. One cigarette doesn't make you a smoker again, it just makes you a nonsmoker who did something out of their nature. It gets easier every day. I can promise that.

If you've been quit for a while: I am proud of you and plan to join your ranks in the coming years. It's an amazing feeling to be at one year, but now I'm excited for five years.

Thanks again, and keep up the good work everyone! Hit me up with a DM anytime you need a pep talk or anything else related to our shared journey back to health. I mean it.

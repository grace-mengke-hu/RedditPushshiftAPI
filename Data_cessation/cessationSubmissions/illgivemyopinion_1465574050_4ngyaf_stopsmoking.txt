What a horror at times.

Just realized what a terrible person i can be without cigarettes. i don't know if it's right for me or not. Anxiety & depression are my enemies, smoking helped but i hate it. Hate the smell, addiction and cravings/cost. But without it, i hate the cat, the dog, music and my wife/kids. Everything is irritating me. Everything i love, i'm hating right now. Haven't smoked since yesterday at 2:00pm.

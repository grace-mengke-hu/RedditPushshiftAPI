What a fucking week this has been!

I’ve done a week’s work, driven 1500 miles, left home on Sunday and got back on Friday, had my teeth sandblasted on Wednesday (if you’ve never experienced it be very grateful, it’s as bad as it sounds), and yesterday I was told I ha Sri get a job that should have taken a week done by today. 

It’s been a fucking awfully shit week

But I didn’t use that as an excuse to smoke!!!!

Smug face 😁

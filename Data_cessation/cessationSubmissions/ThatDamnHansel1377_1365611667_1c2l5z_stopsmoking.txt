First Day, gonna be tough

so, this is my first day of trying to quit in years, im not sure how to do it honestly, I've been awake for like 4 hours and i am already dying, you guys know the feeling. I have been trying to convince myself to quit for a while, and even started doing a lot more cardio in m workouts but that only subdues the need for a few hours, even less if it has been a while since my last.

I hear that replacing the habit works, what do i replace it with though?

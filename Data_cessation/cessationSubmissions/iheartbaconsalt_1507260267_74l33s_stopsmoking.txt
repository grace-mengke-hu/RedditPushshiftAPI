Well, I have failed at my longest quit ever.

I just went from [hero](https://i.imgur.com/RQuMSGv.png) to 0. 

I was out of screens for a bowl, and I borrows a pack of smokes from the wife.  I removed most of the tobacco, replaced with herb, but then I had a few without modifications.  I told her to stop letting me have them.    She's trying to quit, so she's in another room.  It was just convenient at hte moment.  Bigly sad. 

I start again right now.

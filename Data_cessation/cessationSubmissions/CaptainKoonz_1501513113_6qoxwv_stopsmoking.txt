15 year smoker, on day 4 without a cigarette.

And I want one *right now*.

I have a vaporizer at home that helps cravings, but I don't take it in public because I make huge silly looking clouds.  Craving one bad at work right now.  Trying to fight the urge to buy a pack with gum, peppermints, and water.

I had slowed down to about 2 packs a week before making the decision last Thursday that I wouldn't spend any more money on those damn things.

This is the hardest part.  I've made it months before and always slipped back.  This weekend I'm going on a bachelor party vacation with a bunch of my smoking friends...  

I don't actually have a question, just needed to vent a little.  Thinking about the taste and smell of a cigarette actually feels bad, but I still want one.

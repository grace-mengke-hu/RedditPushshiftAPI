My primary physician just changed my file to say non-smoker. One of the best feelings I’ve had in a while.

I went for a follow up visit. I quit smoking 60 days ago and the doc said that that’s long enough for the file to be changed to non-smoker. I am so proud of this moment. 

She did warn me that I’m not out of the woods yet and to stay vigilant for flare ups and fight them as hard as possible.

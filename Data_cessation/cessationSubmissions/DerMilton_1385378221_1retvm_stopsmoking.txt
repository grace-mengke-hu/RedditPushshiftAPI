Once again? More like once and for all!

Just another ciclejerking text I WANT to write. I've tried time and time again to stop smoking and for some time (6 Months) I was doing it. Then I picked it up over time again, slowly smoking here and there until I bought my own again...

Over the weekend I had a minor break down - I CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS - so today I reread the final chapter of "The EasyWay" and I'm feeling pretty good... Pretty fucking good!!!

Yippe! I'm a Non-Smoker!!

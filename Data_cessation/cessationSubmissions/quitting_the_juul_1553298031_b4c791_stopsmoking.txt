I'm down to 4 Juul pods and I told myself that I would quit after I went through my stash (8 4-packs). Now I'm starting to make excuses for buying more. Please help.

I was originally chain smoking cigarettes because everyone I work with smokes 2-3 every smoke break. I enjoy spending time with them on the breaks, but it's really hard not to smoke. 

I also live with people who smoke cigarettes.

I switched to the juul 2-3 months ago and I've been smoking more than I normally would because of how convenient the juul is, I constantly rip it at my desk and go through 1-2 pods a day.

My throat is constantly sore at the end of the night and in my head, I'm like "wow, I wish i didn't have this sore throat so I can enjoy the juul more" as I'm smoking the juul. 

I'm about to move out into my own apartment in a month and I bought 8 packs of juuls (each contains 4 pods).

I'm on my last pack (4 pods) and I'm already making excuses.

"I should buy more because I'll be going to a concert next month with someone who smokes"

"I should buy more pods because I'm still living with smokers  for another month" 

My main reasons for quitting are the cost, the dependency on constantly having to hit my juul, and the sore throat from smoking so much. 

If I quit I feel like I would get time back that I would normally think about smoking and use it towards something productive. 

I feel like I'm about to cave and I don't know what to do.

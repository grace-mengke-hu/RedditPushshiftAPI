1 month and 27 days - why is it getting harder?

Hi all, 

My quit went fine for the first month or so. Then I started having mental breakdowns every week. Last week was extra stressful due to traveling and I’ve been close a few times. For some reason it seems to be getting harder. I used to be so confident, and now I feel weaker. I cannot seem to shake stress. I don’t feel as much fun anymore— I complain and put my anxiety on others. Is this normal? What is this? 

This is my third time officially quitting, and I’ve never been quit for so long. I started smoking as a teen, about 6 years ago. 

I appreciate your help. I’m going here because I’m tired of going to my friends and family. I’m sure they’re getting tired of my growing bitching and rants and listlessness.

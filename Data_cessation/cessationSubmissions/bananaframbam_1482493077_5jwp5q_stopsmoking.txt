Christmas Gift to Self: Update

I made it to three days! I really feel I have a handle on this now. Yesterday was the worst (Day 3). I had horrible dull headaches and my edginess was at its max. However, I treated myself to some delicious foods and took it five minutes at a time.

I will say it's the psychological self-talk of 'No, you don't get to smoke because you made it so long. That's dumb. That's the addiction talking' that is the most challenging. The physical cravings and withdrawals are manageable.

So yeah, I feel good about making it three days and accomplished. Now to set out for a week :)

Edit: The sheer amount of avocados I've eaten in the past 72 hours is shameful. Ha!
Hooray!!

:D

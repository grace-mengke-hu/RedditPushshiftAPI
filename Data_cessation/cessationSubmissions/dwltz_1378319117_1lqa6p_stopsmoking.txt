My mood is terrible

I've quit for 7 days now and I've noticed that from day 3 on out the smallest things can set me off like a timebomb. Whenever somebody tells me something in the wrong way I find myself wanting to bite their heads off.

I've listen to Allen Carr's book and I must say, it works. I wouldn't start smoking again, even if somebody would offer to pay the entire addiction for me, from cigarettes to medical bills.

So basically, I do not want to smoke yet I have terrible moodswings. Anybody else had this? How did you deal with them? And how long did you 'suffer' from this?

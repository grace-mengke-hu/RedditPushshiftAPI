Day 7: DAE know food has taste?

At 10pm tonight it will be a full week without cigarettes, and it's been a good week.

I've tried to quit before, and the longest I've got was a month, but this time feel deal. I'm realizing and focusing on how terrible I felt all the time. It's weird to say, but in 5 years of smoking, I had no idea that I felt like shit every day. I didn't know how much my teeth hurt until they didn't. I didn't realize I slept terribly until I had a good night sleep. And I had no idea I couldn't taste until I was blown away by the flavor of Panda Express.

Here's to another week, then a lifetime.

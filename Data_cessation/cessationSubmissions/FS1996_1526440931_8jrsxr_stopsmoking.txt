Quitting today

After numerous attemps to stop smoking I haven't lasted more than 3 days without smoking, been smoking for 4 years a pack a day of Marlboro reds, getting close to 2 packs in the weekends \(blame the alcohol\). It's 05:12AM at the moment and I have 3 cigarettes left, I'll smoke the last 3 ones and hope to never smoke again. I have some worries though, but doesn't everyone? My main worries are:

\- I'm single now, but I'm worried about what happens if I start dating a girl who happens to smoke, since I smoked throughout all of my relationships and all of my exes were smokers.

\- Worried that I'll relapse while drinking alcohol 

\- The possible gain in weight

Goodluck to everyone who's in the same situation, the thought of quitting for real this time is both a relief and a huge challenge.

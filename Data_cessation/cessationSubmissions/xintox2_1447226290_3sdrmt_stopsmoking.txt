Breaking the chains of nicotine tomorrow.

I have smoked for 26 years, dipped on and off.

I am done with nicotine. I've tried all the alternatives, but its still ingesting nicotine....keeping the beast within addicted to the slave mentality that big tobacco depends on.

I'm done. Not giving those bastards another dime.

I have the "Smoke Free" iPhone app, and a large bottle of valium for when the nic-fits come.

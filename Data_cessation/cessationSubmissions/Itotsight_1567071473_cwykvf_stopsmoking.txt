Was about 4 months clear, started smoking again for about 4 months. Now 2d 18h since quittin'.

I stopped 4 months in january. Then had difficult time in life and started smoking occasionally, then it escalated to smoking daily. I knew i wanted to quit again. I just  needed a crutch and it was smoking at that time that helped me through my daily life. I knew i needed to stop smoking once it gets better.

Now i had a enough with smoking. I don't want to spend my money on cigarettes. I want to start saving money again. I have saved 800€ with quitting. It's about 350€ less what it could've been since i started again back then. I'm excited that i can save that missing amount too in couple months with the cigarette saving money, then i'm back on track.


This quitting again is so hard. I mean the mood swings came in the first and second day, but at january those came after two weeks of quitting. Now i'm doing okay. :)

tldr: quitted, started because life got hard, quitted again and i'm not going so start again.

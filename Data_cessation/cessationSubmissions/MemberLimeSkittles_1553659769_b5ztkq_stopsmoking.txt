My daughter...

I was smoking for 13/14 years. I tried quitting multiple times, but never really made it past the first week.. maybe a month tops. It’s been 23 days since my last cigarette and going cold turkey has honestly been the easiest method yet... I realized it was time for me to make a change when the things I would do to satisfy a craving turned to new extremes. I’m guessing everybody’s “rock bottom” is different... Mine was when I started smoking in my car with my 2 year old in the back seat. I never even smoked in this car I got after I had her until it started getting cold this winter driving to work... I would convince myself as long as she wasn’t physically in the car it would be ok... Then during a long road trip last month I started smoking in the car with her in it.... I kept trying to convince myself that it was okay because she wouldn’t be exposed to it long and the whole “my parents smoked in the car/house when we were kids and we turned out fine...” and I started smoking in the bathroom at night so I wouldn’t have to brave the elements outside during winter...That’s where my wake up call came in. 
I always tried to rationalize my behavior, at least I’m not on heroin or meth...but it still doesn’t make it right. In some ways it’s actually worse of an addiction. I love my daughter and I would do anything for her. I don’t want her growing up watching me take my life away and hindering her life in the process.

quit smoking increased suicide?

i quit smoking 10 days ago, no cravings or anything, everything seems great. however i have really strong urges to kill myself. on the way home from work without even realizing it i swerved into oncoming traffic. luckily nothing happened, but now i'm scared shitless. i feel like ever since i quit someone else is controlling me.

is this just something normal that i need to wait to pass? i assume in a few months when my body is back to normal this should go away, but what to do in the meantime? i smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years.

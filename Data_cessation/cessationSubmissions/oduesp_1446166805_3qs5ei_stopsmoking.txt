I quit with the help of this forum and Alan Carl's Easyway on June 25th 2015. Smoked for 8 years, at my peak a pack a day. Having some hard cravings right now for some reason. Makes me reminisce smoking and want to go back to it. But it's impossible for me to go back, I quit for so many reasons, primarily my health and teeth. It's hard to watch people smoke, not knowing how much smoking is affecting their lives and those around them. It dictates who you associate with. It plans your day. It only allows your life to head in specific directions, directions dictated by smoking.

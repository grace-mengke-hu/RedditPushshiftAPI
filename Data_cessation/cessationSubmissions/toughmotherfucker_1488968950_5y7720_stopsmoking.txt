Anyone here had improvements in their face when they quit?

I've been trying to quit for a long time already, I started smoking at the age of 16, tried em when I was 15 but never really liked it. I started smoking a pack a day since late 2015 and it affected me a lot. Sometimes I usually feel tired even though I had a good sleep.

It also made me look a lot older, I compared my picture back in 2015 when I was just smoking for months and not even a pack a day and it looked like I aged a decade in only more than a year.

I'm currently smoking right now and any help that would encourage me to quit is appreciated. :D

Grateful for Pneumonia

Hi All, yesterday I had one year without smoking. I am so grateful to be able to breathe these days. 

To be honest, cigarette smoke now really smells strongly to me, and I'm surprised I ever smoked. 

This is the third time I have gotten to more than a year. At one point, I had five.

Still, I wanted to share that I am grateful to the pneumonia that led to my quit a year ago. I never want to go back to the wheezing, inability to sleep panic feeling of not being able to get enough air. 

Best of luck to you all in your quits. From where I sit, quitting is a beautiful thing, and I plan to never go back.

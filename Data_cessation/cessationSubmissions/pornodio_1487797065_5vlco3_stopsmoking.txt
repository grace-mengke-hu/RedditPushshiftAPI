quitting smoking cured my anxiety and depression

I've been strunggling with those for 10 years basically. 

It was as simple as quitting smoking to cure it all.

Now I'm only 5 days in, but last year I was 3 months without smoking and it made miracles. And even now 5 days in I'm feeling it.

What once used to depress me for an entire day now just becomes a slight nuisance that stimulates me.

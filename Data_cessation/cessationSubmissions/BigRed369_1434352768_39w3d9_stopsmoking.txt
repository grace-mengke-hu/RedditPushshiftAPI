6 a day, quitting cold turkey

Never used this before but I've smoked mainly socially for around 7 years, started when I was at uni. This gradually progressed to smoking 10-12 a day then cut right down to 6-7. Never smoked in front of parents so work and drinks with friends are the main times I have to fight cravings. 
I feel like mine is a habit more than an addiction because I can spend a week at parents and not feel the need to smoke, makes sense as my brain isnt used to smoking there. But as soon as I get to work or have a few drinks with mates the cravings appear.

Writing this on the walk to work to stop from buying cigarettes. Only had one lapse in 3 weeks (3 or 4 when out drinking) but felt so sick the next day so keep trying to remember that.

The last time I went 24hrs without a smoke was December 1994...

I remember the month and year because I was in a Chinese foreign student dormitory sick from food poisoning and it was snowing outside... and I was too sick to smoke. I remember it because the next day when I smoked, my sickness seemed to disappear...

Started in 1987 or 1988 at age 12 or 13... a friend had "access" to his Dad's Service Station inventory. In a cubby house out in the bush, we had a competition to see who could smoke the most. Dan and I bum-puffed 72 cigarettes straight...

I guess I've smoked 1-3 packs a day since 1992. 

I have a 4 month old daughter now and for the first time in my life I'm considering quitting. 

I have never tried before, because I know I'd fail and I don't want to make a promise I can't keep...

It's hard to post this, my identity over two decades is so... pathetically... entwined with Camels, and I have fostered arrogant scorn for government health regulations and the health crowd in general... 

But I stink. I can't even hold my daughter without her squirming to get away from my bad breath... a new born, repulsed by her own daddy...tears me up.

I got to stop.

I'm stopping.


**Edit:** I awoke to all your comments, and was mightily encouraged. I've just done my second 24hr stint of not smoking since 1994!!!

There is no doubt that if my post had been ignored, I would have caved in 12 hrs ago...

Restless, but happy with myself.

I keep thinking of Lawrence of Arabia.. "You're balmy, that hurts!" "The trick â€¦ is not minding that it hurts...." :)

**Edit:** And... I fucked up at 24.5hrs. But that's OK. I needed to do 24 hours voluntarily, to see if it was physically possible, and discovered it was. That was an important step. Next step, make a plan to go for 48 hours voluntarily, try to work out how to be happier and have mind more preoccupied with daughter and good things... finish reading Alan Carr... (it's a bit hokey, but I need to hear it..)

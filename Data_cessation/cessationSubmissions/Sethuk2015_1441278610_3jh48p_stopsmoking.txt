niece (12) confessed she smokes, need advice

She told me she smokes shisha and has a shisha pen, I have know idea what this stuff is and what it does. Most of the information on the internet contradicts itself.

Should I tell her parents, is smoking shisha bad? I have never smoked, and have come for advice on what to do. Thanks

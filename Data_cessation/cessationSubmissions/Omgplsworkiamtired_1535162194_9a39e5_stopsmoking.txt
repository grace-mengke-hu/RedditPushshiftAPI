Haven’t been on reddit- 5 months quit!

It feels like it has been longer than five months but I quit in February. I have had one slip up. I visited family with out my husband and it didn’t dawn on me that all of this family I spent the weekend with smoked.... it hit me so hard... I gave in for the weekend and had several cigarettes. Went home and pretended it never happened... told my husband who got mad that I did that to my self and we just agreed it was stupid. I told him I wasn’t going to buy any. And I haven’t. I still get cravings but it’s linked to my ADD, depression, and anxiety. I am still learning how to not have a crutch and facing emotions and learning new coping skills. With out nicotine. :)

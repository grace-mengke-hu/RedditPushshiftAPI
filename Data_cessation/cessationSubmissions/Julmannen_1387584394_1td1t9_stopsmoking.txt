Any tips on how to handle cravings while driving?

I am currently attempting to quit smoking cold turkey (7 hours in so far, yay me) and I've been intentionally exposing myself to the usual triggers like eating or playing a game of League of Legends (I always smoke after playing, sometimes even during) and the cravings aren't actually bad at all, I just have a slight headache, but it's no big.

Problem is I drive a lot everyday to class/work etc, and in my mind driving is very, veeeeeeeeeery heavily associated with smoking because I get bored. Does anyone else have this problem? What do you do to distract yourself? I'm very afraid that as soon as I get back behind the wheel I'll just crack and light up again.

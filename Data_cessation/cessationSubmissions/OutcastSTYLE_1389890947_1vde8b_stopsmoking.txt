Trouble with Mindset

I don't want to smoke anymore. I know that it's not attractive, I know that it's bad for my health and I know that it's minimalizing the effort I put in at the gym.

That being said, I can't seem to keep that mindset for longer than 3 hours. After that I stop caring about the above until I have another smoke.

I've read Easyway and along with Champix, I was able to quit for a few years a little back, but have recently picked it up again as I went through an extremely stressful time. At the beginning, I was able to put them down at will, however now that I've smoked regularly for over a month it's gotten exponentially harder. I went 8 hours yesterday and then caved because I rationalized that one smoke would even me out and that would be it. That wasn't it.

Any thoughts?

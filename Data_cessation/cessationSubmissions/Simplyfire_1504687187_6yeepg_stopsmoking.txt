30 days report!

During the first month of my epic quest to use my mortal avatar responsibly I have noticed the following:

- I can feel the wind play with the hair on my arms so intensely now I could write a short erotic story about it.

- I can taste food, I mean I actually really like food now. I get to re-taste everything. I ate a lot the first two weeks - I didn't mind indulging in it for a while just to help me cope. It has mostly settled down to my previous consumption now.

- I started walking to and from work every day, just to give me that 1 hour of me time and for the joy of moving. Didn't have to make myself do it or anything, I genuinely enjoy moving and breaking a sweat now. I used to have unpleasant headaches after periods of physical activity, which was really discouraging, but these have not appeared since I stopped. No idea if there is a real connection, but it feels like there is.

- The amount of energy I have at my disposal is unreal.

- I can no longer drink 6 cups of coffee a day. Its effects are somehow amplified and this has not yet returned to previous levels. If I drink two cups of strong coffee in an hour I get that kind of anxious nervousness that feels very similar to craving nicotine - could this be why the two are so connected in the popular consciousness? I think smoking may have had something to do with inhibiting the effects of caffeine.

- I had trouble sleeping for the first week. Even though I could not sleep I felt I had tons of energy to spare. It's settled down to previous levels now.

- I cried a lot the first week. It's a lot better now, still kinda up and down but at least it's my own emotions again.

- I stopped coughing by day 3.

- I feel a lot calmer and collected than when I smoked, less anxious, more focused. Perfect.

- I found confidence to actually tackle serious issues that I should have addressed many years ago and kept putting off.

- I told a heavy smoker acquaintance of mine I'd join him for a weekend trip to his home town for a festival and I backed out at the last moment. May have burned that bridge. I won't mind if he doesn't contact me again. This bridge can burn.

- I still smoke weed but obviously I stopped mixing it with tobacco (as is customary in the lands of my people). Took a while to perfect the rolling technique without the tobacco, but I get to have fun with my rolling skills and the highs are something else. I don't miss the tobbaco in it at all. Anyone who said pure joints don't burn either did not try it or did not know how to roll it or just had wet material.

- I might have to stop drinking. I don't usually drink too much in one sitting, but in the last 30 days, there were approx. 3 days that I didn't drink at all. I decided for no hard liquor for the time being. If I do catch myself with a lit cigarette while drunk, I will stop drinking altogether. It's not that I feel tempted at all, I just study the smokers from a distance much in the same way as I study my own addiction, it's just that I can see my inhibitions floating away and most beer drinkers also smoke where I come from. For now I mostly drink alone. I do think this is the most likely single failure point of the whole attempt.

- The cravings are completely gone now. All I have left is a vague memory of a habit from a different time. As I open the door of my room, sometimes a familiar thought flashes through my mind "oh are we going for a smoke now?" and I just smile.

So I just wanted to log this for future me and for anyone who might be interested in stopping. If you have any thoughts, please share. :)

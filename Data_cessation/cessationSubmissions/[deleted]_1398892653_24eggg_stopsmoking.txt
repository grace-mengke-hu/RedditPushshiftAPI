I'm planning on riding my bicycle 104 miles from Portland, Oregon to the Oregon Coast for the American Lung Association.


I'm dedicating this ride to the smokers out there who want to quit.  As a former pack a day smoker of over 10 years, one miserable day I just decided that day was the day, it couldn't get any worse.  I've had some relapses in the 3 years since that day, but I never gave up, and never bought another pack.  Maybe the simple act of donating $10 to the American Lung Association will trigger something in you to hold strong this time.  Maybe you'll remember this one off thing you did and it will inspire you sometime down the road.  My goal is not to raise the most money, but to get as many people as possible to take an action, any action, no matter how small, that can help them quit.  If you're not ready to quit, I'm not trying to convert you, but if you are, make a move, the journey of 100 miles begins with the first pedal.

If you're looking for more info, I bet the American Lung Association can say it better than I can ( http://www.quitterinyou.org/ ) (But I bet you've heard all that before, just do it)

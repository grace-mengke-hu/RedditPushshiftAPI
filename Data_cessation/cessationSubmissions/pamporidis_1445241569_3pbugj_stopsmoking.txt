It has began

I am 29 years old and i have been smoking since i was 19. I have tried quitting before a couple of times but with no success. This time though, i have read Allen Carr's books and my perspective is quite different. I am ready.

When the cravings come i will visit this subbreddit for encouragement! Wish me luck!

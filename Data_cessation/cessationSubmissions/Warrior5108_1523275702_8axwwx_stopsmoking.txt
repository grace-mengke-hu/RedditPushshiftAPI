Cant think of anything else besides a clickbait title

Can tell ya one great trick to stop smoking is have your life fall out of control with drinking,binge eating/food, and smoking. 

When my life blew up in my fucking face after about 2 weeks of strong cravings I kind of almost forgot about nicotine for awhile. 

Now when it crosses my mind sure I still want it. But since I currently can’t drive without someone else driving me for awhile I could never get it. 

Plus now that I been away from it for so long and know how bad withdraws are ( I at one point really believed “I don’t get withdraws”) I don’t think I would. Well now I know I wouldn’t get it anymore. Plus I was always ashamed of it because my real life role-model never used nicotine I always felt so lame about it.

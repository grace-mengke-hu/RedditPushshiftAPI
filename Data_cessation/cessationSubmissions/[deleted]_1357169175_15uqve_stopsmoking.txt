Having urges lately...

I used to be a chewer (there isnt much of a subreddit for us ex-snusers) and as you can see I've been doing great! 145 days, almost made it half a year.  Month 2 and 3 were basically the easiest- no urges, the thought didn't even cross my mind for weeks at a time,  but now I'm getting random urges to throw in a dip.  It doesn't help that my roommate started chewing after I quit so there are always cans laying around. (fuck, just typing this is making my mouth water...) 

I'd like some tips on how to get back to not having the urges (if possible).  I'm pretty sure one of my biggest triggers is being in a bad relationship.  I was going through 1.5 cans a day during the worst times with my previous ex and after I broke up with her and got over that depression quitting came pretty easily actually. Now I'm dating another girl and it's already starting to cause stress, I don't see us lasting much longer. 

I --REALLY-- don't want to relapse here, guys.  I've made it to 3 months before and then my buddy convinced me to just throw one in for the buzz.  That one turned into one a week, one a day, etc until I slipped back down that slope. I really want to kick the can for good this time and would LOVE some advice.

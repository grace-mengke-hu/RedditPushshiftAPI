Today Is The First Day Of The Rest Of My Life

Today is the day. No more cigarettes, smokes, darts, whatever you call them. It hit me like a ton of bricks a couple of months ago that I'm now closer to 40 than I am to 30. The invincible 20's are long behind me. 

I'm not filled with doubt and dread like I was in the past when I quit. I'm feeling confident and I think I have the right mindset to make this journey now. I don't give a fuck about the social aspect anymore (alot of my friends smoke), and it really used to bug me that I was "missing out". 

Anyhow, that's my blurb. I'll be leaning on this subreddit a bit now, getting tips and such from you folks. Hope your battles are all going well, and here I go on mine.

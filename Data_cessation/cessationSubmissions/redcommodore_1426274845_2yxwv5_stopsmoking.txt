Irritability/new coping methods?

I quit over two months ago, and I am happy about that accomplishment, but I have been noticing that I don't cope with things as well as I used to. I knew there would be a period of irritability as the nicotine left my system, but I feel like it's worse now than it was in those first few days. I don't know if it's related to no longer smoking or if it's something else. My assumption is that it's related because having a cigarette is what I used to do to calm/center myself. My temper is short, people annoy me very easily, and I cannot shake an overall sort of listlessness/depression. Is it normal to experience these things months after quitting or should I be looking for another cause in my life? Did anyone else have a hard time finding new coping mechanisms or dealing with people?

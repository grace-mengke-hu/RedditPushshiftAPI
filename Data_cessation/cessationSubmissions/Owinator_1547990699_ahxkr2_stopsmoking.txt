17 days in and I still have anxiety

I stopped smoking 17 days ago and the only withdrawal symptoms I seem to have are terrible anxiety plus some mild dizziness/headaches. Anyone else gone through something similar so I don't feel like im going crazy? Never really had anxiety until around Day 5-7 of quitting.

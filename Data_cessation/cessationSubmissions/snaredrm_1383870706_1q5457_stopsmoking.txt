38: An Open Letter to those who may be interested.

38 days! This has been the easiest & longest quit I've had. I have succeeded combining two of the previously failed methods; patches and "cold turkey". One thing I've learned, bathrooms smell worse when quit, that has almost convinced me to start again (joke) It's true, though, BEING QUIT IS EASIER. I don't need to wash my hands like I'm trying to scrub my skin off and brush my teeth a couple extra times a day to cover up the smell from my wife! She has been awesome during the last couple years of newlywed marriage, in which I told her I'd quit prior to our wedding, but she supported me going quit without showing how pissed it makes her. Not smoking is awesome. I will admit, I am still dealing with withdrawal; especially when tired but I read that it will last for possibly a year, if not longer. 

**Pre-Quit**

09/27: Started the patch in AM. Smoked once at night (bar)

09/28: Patch. Smoked once at night (party)

09/29: Patch. Smoked once at night (stress)

**Non-Smoker**

09/30: Patch. No smokie. Day 1.

10/1: Patch. No smokie. Day 2.

10/2: Nicotine Free! Day 3.

*And the rest is history!*

Though, it IS kind of ironic, whenever I'm reading self-help topics (not including this subreddit) on quitting smoking, it makes me crave a cig the worst! I gotta stay away from that stuff!!

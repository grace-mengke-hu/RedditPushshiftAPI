Smoking tastes like shit!

Relapsed once again last friday, bought a pack while drunk but for the first time I can remember it tasted awful. Will have to remember that next time drunken me have cravings. 

Since september last year I have smoked about 100 cigaretts on 5 occations, that is not optimal but at least that is 5500 cigaretts not smoked! 

Sory for the rant, tired of relapsing and day3 cravings. Stay strong!

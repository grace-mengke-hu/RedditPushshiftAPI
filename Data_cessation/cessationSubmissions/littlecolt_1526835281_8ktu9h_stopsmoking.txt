Two Years

I could talk for ages about it, but I'll just say a few things. First of all, for those trying to quit, it gets a lot easier. If you're nervous, don't be, just do it! Power through!

This sub helped me a lot just by being able to look at the flair. The Smoke Free app on Android also helped me a lot.

Cheers, mates! Here's to many smoke-free years for us all!

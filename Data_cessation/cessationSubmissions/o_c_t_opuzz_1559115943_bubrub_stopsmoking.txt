Tackled alcohol and diet, now smoking remains. MORNINGS!

Right, so as the title suggests, I've been sober for 2 months, and fasting has helped me a great deal with my weight / depression also. Feeling great. 

But I still smoke.

I get maybe 1-2 urges throughout the day, but in general, I don't smoke a great deal after 7am, apart from the morning! I can get 6-10 fags down my gullet with black coffee. I have a vape. Should I make more efforts to have that around me? Should I just chuck away my tobacco? 420? Give up coffee?

I thought smoking would be easier to quit than booze, but I find more opportunities to add smoking to, alcohol used to be it, and now it's coffee. I think I know the answer, but any advice on mornings / coffee would be ace. Also hello and thank you!

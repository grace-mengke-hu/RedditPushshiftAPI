Weird Dreams the night before my 1 month mark

So today is officially one month without nicotine for me! I never thought I could do it, and I owe it in part to this forum. You guys are awesome and help me continue to choose not to smoke every day!

I had the WEIRDEST dream last night, however. I dreamed that I had relapsed and lit up a cigarette. I woke up in a panic for half a moment before realizing it was only a dream, and that I was waking up to a month without nicotine in my body.

If I can do this, so can you. Just continue to make the right choice. You know what to do.

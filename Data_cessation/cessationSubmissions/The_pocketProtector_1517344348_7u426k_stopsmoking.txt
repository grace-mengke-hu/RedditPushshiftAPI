Why is this so hard?

Ignore my badge - at the time of composing this, it's completely wrong.

I've read Allens's book twice and I've watched the DVD 3 times, but the pangs still get to me, to the point where I actually get dizzy when I haven't had a cigarette in over 24 hours. I can't relax and I can't even drive when it happens!

The first time I read the book, I went without nicotine for 4 days and felt great. Then for whatever reason I went and bought a pack. I don't understand - I've beaten my addictions and cravings to every other drug I've done but this one seems so much more powerful, even though the cravings are supposed to be very weak.

I'm thinking that when my next final cigarette is decided on, I'll go for a short run whenever I get a craving, give my mind something to focus on through the dizziness. I'm hopefully going to be able to get through to someone at the US EasyWay center tomorrow.

Does anyone have any advice on how to help me convince myself that the cravings aren't actually so bad?

Thank you! :)

EDIT: Literally as soon as I submitted this post, the EasyWay center called me back! I spoke with a very nice woman. She said that the dizzy feeling that I get after abstaining from nicotine is due to increased blood flow to the brain, as a result of blood vessels no longer being constricted! This is absolutely fantastic to learn! This honestly makes me so happy to know that nothing is really wrong with me, and that this is a normal thing!

I feel invigorated! This is amazing! I CAN do this! Yes! I am so happy right now! YIPPEE :p

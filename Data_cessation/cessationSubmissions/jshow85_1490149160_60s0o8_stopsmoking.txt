I need your help, r/stopsmoking! I need participants to anonymously fill out my survey for grad research.

I am a graduate student doing some research on factors that influence people to quit smoking.  
[If you'd like to help out and take the quick anonymous survey, it'd be a huge help!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZ4E1_HzRLg6XtxrHO7ZPa00K55tVDTXQXqQ5-zii_6wHd6g/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

Note: if you have ideas for other questions that might help my study, your input is welcome!

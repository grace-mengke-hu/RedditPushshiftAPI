I just turned 29, and I've been smoking since I was 14. I've been smoking heavily for over half my life..

Today I've made the 48 hour mark without smoking and I'm still going strong. One day at a time, I guess. I'm feeling kinda proud about this small achievement. Apparently, the urges will get less and less. ;-)

Any good advice for a quitter/apps that help? I really want to quit this awful habit once and for all.

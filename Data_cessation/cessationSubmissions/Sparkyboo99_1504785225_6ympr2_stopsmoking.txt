Day 12!!! I'm not looking back!!

Day 12 today, I'm already losing count of the days. Not going to lie, stress has been higher than usual and I have had some rough cravings.  But I didn't give in and they are less and less with each day.  I'm loving the money I'm saving and not worrying about smelling like an ashtray.  Over the last weekend I was proud to stay smoke free while my smoker family had to hide out while getting their fix.  If I can do this you can too!!

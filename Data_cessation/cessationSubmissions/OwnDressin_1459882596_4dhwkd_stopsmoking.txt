Smoking. The one device I can't quit.

The longest I was smoke free was for one year. After reading Alan Carr it was the easiest decision I've ever made. Then all it took was one relapse and I am back to my normal habit (8 a day).


For the first time I have noticed the health affects. Specifically the breathing problems. Not being able to take a full breath causes so much anxiety. But I still haven't had the willpower to quit.


Willpower. That is the one thing that is needed. I've been reading "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg. He uses smokers as an example throughout the book.


Willpower and a support group. Having people to talk to about this is valuable. For me it's difficult to talk to people because I have hidden my smoking from my family. And my friends seem to have other vices that would be considered more detrimental than smoking. There is no AA for smoking.


I turned thirty last month and told myself that that was goong to be my cutoff date. I made it 4 days and went right back to it.  


As of this second I am a non-smoker. I am tired of short term "pleasures" effecting my long term life. I want to be able to be mindful and meditate without stressing over my breathing. I want to smell nice. I'd like to have an extra $100 a month to do whatever I want with. I want to be healthy.


I would like to rant on this subbreddit. I want to become more active here to help others along as I continue not smoking. 


My goal for today. Make it through without a cig. So I can post a positive story for here tomorrow.

Thank you for reading.


**tl;dr: I believe in the power of this subreddit and the power in myself to change my smoking habit.**

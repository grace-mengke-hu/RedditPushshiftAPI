How do I help?

My girlfriend (20), has been smoking since she was 16. She tried quitting cold turkey a month ago, that didn't go well. So now she's been cutting back, and slowly taking herself off them. She's gone down from 1 smoke per hour to usually 1 per 2 hours, or so.

I'm really proud of her. I support her decision and I try to keep her busy when we're not doing anything. But is there anything else I can do? I *really* want to help. I never started smoking, I almost wish I had started (and quit) so I could be more helpful and understanding. Well, not really. But I wish I could relate better. 

Thanks, and good luck to all of you!

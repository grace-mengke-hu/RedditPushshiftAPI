The Easy Way to Stop Smoking

I struggled with the drug addiction that is smoking for a whole 9 years. I smoked nearly 3 double packs a day. Some days it was worse. I tried the willpower method of stopping and "quitting". Quitting like I was giving up something good? Nah. I hate myself for ever falling for that Nicotine trap. It's horrible and every one of you knows it. No one really enjoys smoking! That's bullshit.

So if you really want to save your life and get back your old self, read the book. Go to one of the seminars listed in that link. You know you want to get out. Every smoker knows they want to.

I go about my days now not even thinking or wanting a smoke. Its not even a battle. I can't believe I used to wake up wanting to smoke one and have another one after lunch and every meal and wake up in the middle of the night sometimes for a fix of that drug.

I also remember how much shit I put my mother and sister through for cigarettes. How I blew away my life savings on that monster. So do yourself a favour and get out because you can. Don't pretend that its cool or necessary.

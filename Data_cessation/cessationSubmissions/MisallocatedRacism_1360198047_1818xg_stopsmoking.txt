Job turned upside down, biggest craving so far, didn't smoke.

Not to bore you with the details, but I think being interactive with this subreddit helps me. Great, cool boss gets fired. High-pressure, micro manager starts today. Gives speech, totally going to hate this job now (previously loved and cared deeply about it). Biggest craving since I've quit, even when drinking or other stressful times. Best part of my otherwise shitty day, was knowing that at least I didn't buy a pack. That is all.

PS. To all those who are scared to quit, I lurked for awhile too. After 3-4 days, it's no big deal. Just grabs onto you every now and then after that. You can do it.

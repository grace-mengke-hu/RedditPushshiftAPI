Two years smoke-free and I’m still jealous of smokers!

I was able to quit two years ago after many failed attempts (thanks to Mr. Carr’s book) and it’s been mostly good. I just can’t get past the immense jealousy I feel when I see people smoking. I know I’ll never go back or let myself indulge but boy does it make me feel shitty. Will I ever stop missing it?

Three months today! I breath better! Don't get out of breath or cough! Don't get nicotine urges!

It's great!

I had to quit a few times before it "stuck", and the first month admittingly was very hard mentally and emotionally, but I've done it! Today marks three months, and it was one of the best things I've ever done for myself. I went from 2 packs a day to zero cold turkey!

I have more money, and breath so much easier, I even sleep better. I don't smell, everything is cleaner! No more constant small breaks at work! No more fidgeting! 

Just want to share that it feels great, I'm proud of myself, and I know that if I can do it, you can too!

High Fives all!

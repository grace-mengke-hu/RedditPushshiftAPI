I realized that I'm an adult now and I need to grow up!

I stopped smoking yesterday at 1 am in the morning. After a night of thinking about the way my life is going, I am committed to change some aspects of my life. One of these changes is to deal with my nicotine addiction that I had have it for 5 years for now. Wish me luck, and i hope that all the souls that are in same place like me will found their balance and stop smoking!

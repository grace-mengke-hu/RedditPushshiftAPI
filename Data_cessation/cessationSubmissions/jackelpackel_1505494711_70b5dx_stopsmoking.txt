Relapsed again

When Hurricane Harvey hit us a couple of weeks ago. I was freaking out, because our house was about to start flooding and saw the water creeping up to the door. I was scared shitless because I was worried about the safety of my mum and my three dogs, not knowing if they were going to drown and even if we were going to get rescued in time. We had to stay in the house for seven hours before we got rescued.

When I was working at my old job. They gave me cigarettes think I still smoked just to sell them to make some extra money on the side. I never craved them when I had those 18 packs. But I relapsed due to the high amount of stress due to watch was happening. And this happened just a few days after my one year anniversary of being smoker free.

Now that I'm back to smoking, and sadly chain-smoking again. I find myself back into the addiction and procrastinating of quitting. But my mum and I are going to try and quit once we make the road trip of moving what stuff we still have salvageable from our house and all three of are dogs with us from Houston to Ohio to live with my brother until we can get our own place up there.

I hope that I can get back into quitting smoking again. Will probably need to get back on the patches.

I'm not stopping forever

I'm not smoking today. When I wake up tomorrow maybe I'll want to smoke and if I do then I will. I went for a run today and my lungs gave out before my legs did. That didn't feel good. 

I'm going to approach each day asking the same three questions.

Do I NEED a cigarette today?
Can I survive today without one?
If I can then why not put off starting smoking again until tomorrow?

This is my approach to not smoking. I'll see how it goes. No success or failure, just a more long term view on what is desirable. Having a fag today or breathing with ease in 20 years time.

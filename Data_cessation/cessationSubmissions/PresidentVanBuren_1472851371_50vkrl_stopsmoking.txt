Day 2. What's wrong with me?

I've been a pack-a-day smoker for almost 3 years now. I quit cold turkey Wednesday night so I'm finishing up day 2. I've found it odd that I don't have very many withdrawal symptoms that others seem to have. My smoking was very much a timed thing, cig after dinner, in the car, work break, after work, after fapping, etc. I don't have cravings other than at those times and they last 5 seconds at most before I tell myself no. I don't have any headaches or crazy intense urges. Even drinking 3 beers didn't give me any intense urges. Is it going to get much worse in the next couple of days or is this easier than I've imagined?

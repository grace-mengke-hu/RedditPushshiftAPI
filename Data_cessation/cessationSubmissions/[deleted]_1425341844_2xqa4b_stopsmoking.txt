Smoking and Beer, now there's a problem.

Screwed up tonight after 6 days. Only problem so far (after doing 20 a day until phasing it out a week ago or so), is while drinking. They just seem to work together, especially with Guinness. No cravings during the day, nothing at all. The issue is that after going drinking 1-2 more times, the cravings will hit in the morning after. Then there is trouble, so I'm stopping again. Let's see how this pans out.

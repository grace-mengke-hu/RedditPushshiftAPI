3 months smoke free! If you are male and need a few reasons to quit (or to stay smoke free), look no further.

The two reasons why every guy should quit / stay smoke free right now:

       • most women these days will not date a smoker. period.
       • even if you do find a woman who doesn't mind your terrible habit, smoking causes erectile disfunction so, good luck keeping her around and, "satisfied".

I'm just saying...

Second day (just some venting)

I have quit out of randomness. I have lost my electronic cigarette, and my budget being tight I can't really afford another one. The first day was alright. My hand was mechanically reaching for my ecig but I wasn't too frustrated when I didn't find it. The New Year's party was ok, I didn't mind people smoking in front of me, but I didn't drink.

Today is much more complicated. I feel like I'm in a waiting room. I can't think about something else, I can't focus on what I'm doing. I have a headache and some nausea which didn't stop me from eating compulsively. I'm just waiting for it to go away. I'm happy that there is nobody smoking around me because I would probably ask them for a cigarette. But it's pouring rain outside, and I have everything I need at home, alone.

I hope I can get back to studying tomorrow. It's silly that I quit nicotine now because I have exams coming up soon, but I thought it would never be the right time anyway, and I just happened to have the occasion to stop. I wonder whether this is just not an excuse for procrastinating though, but I don't think so. I have been smoking for 13 years, almost half of my life, and I thought "alright, it ends here".

I think I'm quitting mostly out of pride though. This is not ideal. We'll see.

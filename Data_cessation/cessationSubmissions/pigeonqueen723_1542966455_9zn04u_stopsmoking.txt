I bought a lighter with my zodiac sign on it

Spoiler alert, it's Cancer.

I smoked some cigarillos today (I'm sorry). Stress of the holidays and family got to me. But I was using my decorated lighter with the little pink crab depicted in swirls (how cute!) and it sort of cracked me up that everytime I lifted my lighter to spark up the end of what I was inhaling, I had to look at the words at the bottom: CANCER.

Is that irony?

It actually did sort of spark some sense into my head, and I got a little chuckle out of that and wanted to share.

Man, being a Cancer can be rough sometimes.

Gonna keep the lighter, as a reminder and also to light my scented candles and incense.

IWNSWYT!

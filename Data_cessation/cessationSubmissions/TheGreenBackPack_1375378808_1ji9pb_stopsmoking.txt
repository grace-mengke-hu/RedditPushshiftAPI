Quit officially late Tuesday night, have a question though.

I smoked about 10-13 cigarettes a day for about 3 years, and quit Tuesday night after the last one on my pack was smoked. Yesterday was awful! It took everything in me not to smoke. It was to the point where i thought about smoking for hours at a time without thinking about anything else.

Today though, i feel fine. I've been up for about 6 hours and haven't craved a cigarette at all, and feel completely in control as opposed to yesterday. Is this normal?

Four weeks today. Would someone kindly hit me in the head with a bat?

I've told almost no one because I'm so sure I'm going to fail and having dealt with addicts of various stuff in my life, I know how exhausting it can be watching someone try and fail over and over.  I just keep picturing being able to announce it to people when it's been six months and I'll feel like I have a real shot at sticking to it.

I smoked a pack to a pack and a half a day for over two decades.  I've been using nicorette these four weeks, still am.  I've been stepping myself down.  The first week I took a 4mg whenever I wanted one.  Then I stretched it out to two hours between 4mg.  Then I switched from 4mg to 2mg.  And then I started stretching out the time between the 2mgs.  I'm not really following what they suggest, since I don't want to end up hooked on nicorette, either.  I'm trying to do what makes sense to me.

Today has been real fucking hard.  I usually take a nicorette as soon as I wake up but today I put it off until I couldn't stand it, which was about two and a half hours.  Then I waited until I was out of my mind before taking one again, which was four hours.  I've never gone more than three hours without taking one until today.  I'm going to see if I can level off at only taking one every three hours or so for the next week or two, and then try stepping it down again.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to stick to that program when I'm at work, though, since my job requires some pretty hardcore focus and concentration and today I doubt I could have tied my shoes when I was  at about the three hour mark.

I'm here because misery loves company and I'd like to get miserable with some of you fine fuckers.

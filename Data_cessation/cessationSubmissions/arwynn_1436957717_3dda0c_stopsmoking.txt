This is it. My journey starts today.

I've been lurking this subreddit for awhile now, and I've seen some pretty inspiring posts as to why I should quit smoking over my lurking time. This day has been coming for some time now, but this is what officially does it for me. I found out my boyfriend, a daily cigarette smoker, has taken back up the nasty habit of dipping. I met him a smoker and occasional dipper, and he promised he was going to try to quit dipping and eventually smoking (with my cooperation). He quit dipping 9 months ago, but we've yet to quit smoking after multiple attempts. He came back to dipping recently(ish? don't know 100% but it was around the week before the 4th of july), and I've decided this is it for me. If smokeless tobacco grosses me out this thoroughly, smoking tobacco should too. It never did before, despite the warnings and pictures of black lungs/hairy tongues/cancerous tumors. After one last cigarette over my feelings, I realized I need to quit and try to help him quit both dipping and smoking. I love him and I don't want to see him have the health repercussions that tobacco does to the body, and I don't want to have those repercussions myself. We've tried to quit smoking multiple times in the past, and none of our attempts worked even in the slightest, and I'm probably the heaviest smoker I've ever been, now. However, I think none of my attempts were successful because my heart wasn't in it - I only wanted to quit because my boyfriend was telling me to, or I was sick of standing outside in the most brutal winter this city has ever seen. This time, my heart is in it and I'm not taking 'no' for an answer. Nicotine, I will be free from your shackles!

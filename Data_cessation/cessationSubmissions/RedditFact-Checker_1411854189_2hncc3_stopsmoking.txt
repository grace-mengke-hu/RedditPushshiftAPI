39 Hours and Counting

This is my first attempt, ever.  
This is by far the longest I've gone without, for any reason, since before I was teenager.
20 years, 10-20 a day.  
I'm thinking of this as an experiment to find out what will stop me so I can be better prepared next time.  Right now, i'm not sure anything will stop me?  Trying not to think too far ahead.

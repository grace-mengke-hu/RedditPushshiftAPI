My niece is 17 and has been caught smoking

I started smoking when I was her age. I am 37. I quit 4 months ago after dozens of painful failed attempts. I think itâ€™s pointless to explain here how bad it has been to smoke...long story short, I want to do something for my niece...what can I do? Are you guys aware of any good resource for teens?

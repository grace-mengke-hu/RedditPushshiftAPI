Day #1, the First 24 Hours

I have thought a good few hours about whether or not to do this, and how it would be received, and I decided that writing out my thoughts in a journal entry format may help me to structure my thoughts and to better understand my cravings. 

I started smoking when I was 12 years old. I am now 28. at the age of 25 I had a realization that I had been smoking for longer than I hadn't. This struck a nerve with me, but I never followed through on stopping.

I have smoked 15-20 a day for the last 10 years at least. I can't remember a time when I didn't smoke.

About a week ago, a friend and I took a drive to the Supreme Court of Appeal (we are both lawyers) to watch a matter taking place. We drove in his car and he did not smoke. The drive was around 8 hours. I found myself counting down the Kilometers until the next stop when I could finally have another smoke. It became almost obsessive at a point.

After we got back, I started mulling in my head that I was sick and tired of being a slave to this ... thing. I made a decision yesterday that I would no longer smoke, and that I have the willpower to quit.

Last night I almost smoked 3 times. I pulled the cig out of the box, held it in my hand for a few seconds and decided to put it away. The last time (just before I went to bed) i held it for almost a full 2 minutes. I had made the decision when I went for the box that I was going to smoke it, and after taking it out, decided that I could do better.

I'm almost hitting the 24 hour mark, and I figured my morning coffee, when I am most likely to want to smoke would be a good time to write this entry. I don't know if I will make it, but I am going to give it a real shot. I am sick of being a slave to this addiction.

I probably won't do an entry a day, but I will try to do them when   I feel the need or remember to.

Thanks if you read this. Good luck on your own journey.

TL;DR - 24 hours.

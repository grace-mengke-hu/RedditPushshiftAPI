Acupuncture

EDIT* I used to smoke 2 packs/day

Anyone already used Acupuncture as a support to stop smoking? 

I decided to stop last week, and my sister did it to me, Im very skeptical and didn't believe in these things. Surprisely, I don't have cravings at all, and my mood is OK. (I drank alcohool last night with my friends and no craving)

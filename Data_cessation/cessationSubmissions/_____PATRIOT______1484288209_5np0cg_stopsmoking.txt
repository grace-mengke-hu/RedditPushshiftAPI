12 hours in on day one.

Just quit vaping today and so far I feel not so great. Mild headache. Decent amount of fatigue and nausea. Been vapor by for 4 years now pretty much all day. What can I expect to face the next week? What can I do to make the detox easier? I should also mention I'm doing this cold turkey. And sorry for everyone who hates vaping I know I it's not the same as smoking but I thought you guys may be able to help

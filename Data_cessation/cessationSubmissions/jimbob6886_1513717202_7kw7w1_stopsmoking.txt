Day 3 ish- Quitters flu?

A couple weeks ago, I went from half a pack a day to maybe 1-2 cigarettes a day. Today, I'm working on my third day not smoking at all and holy crap, I feel awful. Headaches, can't focus, bouts of nausea, my sinuses feel irritated, the works.

I have the desire to smoke, but i know that I'll physically feel worse if i do. Most of the time thats enough deterrence but not always. I'm here in the first place because I started experiencing horrible chest pain/acid reflux and I knew I needed to quit.

How was the first week of quitting for you guys? How do you get through the withdrawals? I did some yoga yesterday and a light workout this morning, I'm trying to eat better and stay hydrated. But right now I can't seem to get on with my day because I feel so sick.

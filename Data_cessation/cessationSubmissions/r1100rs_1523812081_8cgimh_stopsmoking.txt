2 days past 60!

My 60 day milestone snuck up on me, and I missed it by a couple of days. It has been one hell of a two months in which I have had to wrestle the little fuckers on several occasions. Specifically late at night and early in the morning when my mind mistakes the tired signal for a "I want a fucking cigarette" signal. 

However, those "give me" thoughts are few and far between at this point. I'd much rather fall into a lucid dream during a nap, smell the dew on a spring morning, or go for a drive out in the country with the windows rolled down.

Thank you all for your kindness, your advice, and your words on here. They have help me every single day and I look forward to continuing this journey with you!

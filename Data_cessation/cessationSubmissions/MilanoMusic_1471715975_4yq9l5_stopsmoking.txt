About to flush 13 cigs down the toilet

Hey guys, so for about a month now quiting smoking has been in the back of my mind. I woke up this morning and had my usual cigarette and coffee (before breakfast). I now feel like complete shit and it really is time to make a change. I've been smoking since i was 15. Now I'm 20 years old and weigh 115 and am 5'6. Can anyone give me tips to make it the first few days? Really want to start eating better and have an overall life change start today. Thanks guys.

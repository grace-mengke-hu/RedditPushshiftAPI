I talked to my step-dad who is suffering from lung cancer this morning.

I called him in the early morning during one of his "episodes". There was a pain in his voice and I could tell right away that something was up. I asked him what's wrong and he told me he couldn't breathe. I give myself two weeks. In two weeks I will quit smoking.

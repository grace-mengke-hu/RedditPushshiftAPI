Out of smokes- well, now might be a good time to quit for good...

The last time I really tried to quit, I made it like 4 days. Since then I've been putting it off over & over, until now, I'm out of money & out of smokes. I figure I may as well start in earnest again to be a non-smoker from here on out. I want to keep smoking, but it's just not possible anymore. Need to set my mind right & give it another honest go not smoking or bumming. I have exactly 1 patch left, & since usually when I put one on I don't even notice it, I figure I ought to wait until I'm crawling up the walls to use this one, being that its my last. Maybe I'll finish reading that Alan Carr book if I need help. Or type a mess of craving-lunatic spew here on this sub for anyone who'll listen. I'm certainly not looking forward to the trip I'm in for. I have other stuff going on in my life that's a major stressor too, so I imagine my cravings are going to be unbearable. Bummer, huh? I really have to stop now. Kept ignoring the fact that this day would come. Now here it is. :-( Thanks in advance for your replies & encouragement, they do help. I feel like I'm not so alone in this having this sub to turn to. That's one bit of good news I have to be grateful for- the internet. Cheers!

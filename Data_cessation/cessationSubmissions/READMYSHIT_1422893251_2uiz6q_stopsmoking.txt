I'm only a day off I need someone to give me some advice

So I'm sitting here with Allen Carr's book reading the beginning and absolutely dying for a smoke. The book says not to stop til I've read it. Do you think I should get one more box and power through the book (my day off) or just keep reading and consider myself to have quit...

I really lack confidence in myself.

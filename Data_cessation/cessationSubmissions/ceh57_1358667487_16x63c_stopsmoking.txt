gave in tonight

So tonight I gave in tonight and smoked one ciggarette. I've been working all week with some people who smoke. I feel bad that I smoked. I'm pretty drunk at the moment. I had one, does that make me a smoker again? I don't plan on smoking tomorrow or ever again. it was a stupid drunk mistake, i bummed one off of some bar fly. my girlfriend is super pissed at me. i made it 18 days before i gave in. i guess this puts me back at day 1. i feel like shit. i want to say im sorry to my girlfriend. i feel like i should sleep in our bed tonight.

smoke free for 18 days!

I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years, and being that I am about to turn 30, I figured this would be a good time to plant a flag as a nonsmoker once and for all. I'm using the patch, which I know is a bit of a crutch, but getting used to living without a cigarette in my hand was a challenge I had to master. All of my friends are smokers, so every time I hang out with them, the cigarettes can potentially tempt me. BUT the surprising thing is that they don't! They seem so foreign to me now, it almost feels as though I've never smoked. I'm grateful for this community, which inspires me daily to keep going, and to remind myself that life without cigarettes is a daily aspiration from now on. Thanks everyone :)

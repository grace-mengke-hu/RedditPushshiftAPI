I think I'll make it but what gives you pleasure now?

I know that, ultimately, smoking doesn't give one pleasure. It only causes stress and then relieves that stress. Also, lung cancer, emphysema, and general health problems aren't fun.

Has anyone found another pleasure that's healthy? 

Also, I feel like I lost a friend. Seriously, like I'm in mourning.

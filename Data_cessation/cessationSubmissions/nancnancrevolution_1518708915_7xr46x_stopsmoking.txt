Day 3 on the patch.

I am coping pretty okay I guess. I still get a slight “high” like I’ve cheifed a cigarette in record time when I first put it on. And a slight headache for about an hour. I’ve received the nausea a bit by eating before I apply it. 
Yesterday was the first day I worked (at a bar) and it was... doable. I am not sure if I really “needed” a cigarette or that my brain is just wired to get stressed out and go outside. I did step outside a couple times but didn’t cave. 
Has anyone used gum in very stressful situations while wearing the patch?

Lonely and bored when travelling. Dealing with cravings.

I'm on the road for ten days for work. Things get lonely and boring, especially during the evenings. Used to smoke then. Feeling the absence now. I know better, trust me, and I won't smoke. But knowing better does not always translate into feeling better. Hoping this post will adjust my attitude and perhaps get some good advice. In any cases, best regards on your challenges today.

Trying to quit

So I've tried to quit multiple times and each time I end up failing hard. I started smoking back when I was about 14 and I'm 23 now. The biggest reason I want to quit is because of my nephews. They both look up to me and I don't want them picking up my habits so they can live a much better life. This morning I coughed up a very small amount of blood and because of that I am going to try and go cold turkey as of today. If you have any tips on things I can do to help I would greatly appreciate it.

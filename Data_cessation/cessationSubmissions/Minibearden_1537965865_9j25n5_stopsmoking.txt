I smoked 3, but didn't buy a pack.

People I work with today I've been really trying my patience. I bought three cigarettes off of coworker, because I was about to literally punch someone in the throat. I won't reset my badge, because I didn't buy a pack when I had the chance. I consider that a victory, even if it's a very small one.

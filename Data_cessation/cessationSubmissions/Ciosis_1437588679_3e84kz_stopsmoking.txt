Excited to begin (end) again!

I started smoking at 17, and continued regularly consume ~2 to 3 packs per week until I turned 26, at which point I got developed acute bronchitis and two ear infections. It was easy to quit then. I didn't want to smoke at all the first five days, which got me through the physical addiction really well.  The psychological quitting was much, much harder.  But I changed my routine, worked out more, drank less, and ended up losing 10 lbs over the next few months.  I kept that up for about a year and a half.  Then relapsed for a few months.  Then quit again Jan 1st this year, then relapsed St. Paddy's day weekend.  I think I'm finally ready to ditch it for good.  I'm sick of having a near constant sore throat and scratchy voice, and I miss smelling and tasting everything better.  And I'm excited for my hair to be healthy and shiny again, and to get that flushed glow back in my skin. I'm excited to run farther and faster with my dog at my side.
Three years ago today my grandmother died after a brief struggle with trying to bounce back from a stroke, so I'm quitting in her honor. We used to chat at least once a week over the phone, and I could never smoke while talking to her because she would hear me and scold me - in the most loving way possible.  She was the only call I could make that wouldn't be a trigger, and since that (and drinking) are my two biggest triggers - by far - I'll be thinking about her often.  Let's do this.

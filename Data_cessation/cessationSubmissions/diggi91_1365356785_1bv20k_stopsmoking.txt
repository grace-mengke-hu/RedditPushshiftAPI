it's time now!

I wanna quit smoking because I am having a prof. muay thai fight in about 2 1/2 month, and my cardio has to be on top, I know it won't be the best since I've been smoking for 8 years now, but it will most certainly help a lot, I've told myself this before, but know it is time, time to quit both smoking and drinking, I know I can do it, and I will succeed!

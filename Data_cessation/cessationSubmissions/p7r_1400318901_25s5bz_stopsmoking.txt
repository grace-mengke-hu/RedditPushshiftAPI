I get weak sometimes, but my (still smoking) g/f helps me out...

So a few times now I've had a few drinks and I think I've wanted a cigarette. My g/f who smokes very occasionally (basically when we're out drinking) is normally nearby and smoking when the thought takes.

I'll ask for a quick drag of her cig, and the moment the taste hits, I'm convinced I don't want that any more. It's disgusting.

Now, technically, I've smoked, I appreciate that. But one quick drag has stopped me smoking a whole cig, or worse buying a packet. Not enough nicotine has got into my system to make me crave more, but the memory association has changed to that disgusting taste.

The question is - should I reset the counter on my flare? :-)

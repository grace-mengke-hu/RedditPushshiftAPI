Nine-ish month in, my habits and smoker's thoughts have just started up again

I went out from work the other day to get some coffee. As soon as I was out the door I reached for my pack. My thought, "What the hell is this bullshit?" I didn't want one, I was just grabbing for one out of habit. 

Today I saw an ad on the subway for quitting help. I thought about how glad I am now that I'm not trying to scrounge up money for my 3 pack/day habit. Just kind of stared off into space thinking how I had to wake up with at least a pack and a half already in my possession or I was off to a bad start. Normally that's the part where I shake my head and mentally high-five myself for quitting. But today I just thought how content I was and how perfect I found life to be when I had enough cigarettes to get through the day.

So weird. I still don't want a cigarette, but the feelings from both of these events made me fleetingly antsy. I bought some M&Ms and got over it.

It's crazy how much power cigarettes have over my thoughts.

Having some serious cravings right now. It's crazy how deep into justifying a cigarette I will go before I catch myself. I think this is what non-smokers/non-addicts don't understand about quitting. I go through whole periods of total justification of smoking without realising what I'm doing. That's a big part of what makes it hard for me.

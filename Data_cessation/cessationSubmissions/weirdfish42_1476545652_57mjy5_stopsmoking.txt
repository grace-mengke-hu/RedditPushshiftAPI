Today is the day I try

Been smoking since 93, aside from a brief period in the military during and after basic training. Chose Saturday cause I'm not at work, and can just lock myself down. Met a very nice woman online, and she will not meet a smoker. Figure far worse been done over a woman, and even if she doesn't like me, hey, I'm done smoking.

Have to admit I'm going a little nuts, the urge and habit of lighting one is worse then I had imagined, and I've only been awake for 3 hours.

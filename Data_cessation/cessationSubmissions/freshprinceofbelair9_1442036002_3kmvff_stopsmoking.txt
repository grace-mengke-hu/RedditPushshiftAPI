Cigarettes lie to you.

*I'll be your friend. I'll make you feel better while I secretly take your money to give to somebody that doesn't care for you. I'll make you feel relaxed while I slowly rip away your insides. I'll be there for you as long as you give me your time you will never get back, while I distract you from your problems. I'll make you throw up if you take too much of me, but you'll still come back, right? Because you know you can't resist me. Why do you keep coming back while I keep lying to you? Don't you have enough self respect for yourself? No? Well, good, because that's the way I like it.*

Fuck you, cigarettes. You've lied to me for too fucking long.

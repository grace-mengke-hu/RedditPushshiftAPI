3 days and 7 hours!!

it’s been an emotional rollercoaster so far but i’m SO determined, after 6 years of smoking!!!

I’m not ready to give up weed yet as it’s been helping with restlessness and helped to take my mind off cigarettes at night. 

I bought 2 30g packets of Mellow Yellow tobacco substitute so that i’m not smoking joints pure.... once i’ve smoked through those which should take like 2 months, hopefully the nicotine withdrawal won’t be as bad, so by that point I plan to cut down on the weed, which I guess is much easier than cigarettes!!! 

Is that too optimistic?? So far it has really helped and I usually have 1 spliff (with the nicotine-free stuff) before bed to help me sleep. 

Sorry for the rambling i’m just so proud of myself!! and I’m looking forward to in a few months when I might be able to go ages without even a spliff :D

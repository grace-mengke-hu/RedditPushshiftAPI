Today's the day!

Today's the day, I have my patch and lozenges and I'm doing this. The only worry I have is that the first time I quit I managed a month but turned into quite a bitch. Does anyone have tips regarding the wanting to destroy everything? Or any tips with will power when stressed? I can't wait to finally get rid of this awful addiction.

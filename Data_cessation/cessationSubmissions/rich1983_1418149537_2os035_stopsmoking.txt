it doesnt bother me anymore :)

over 120 days smoke free now and i feel like its over, no more cravings or wanting cigarettes, i still get an urge every now and then but its just so easy to say no. recently i went for a drink with some friends and i did have a cigarette but did i know it! i could smell the stink on myself allnite, i didnt smoke the next day and i havent since, all it did was remind me of how much i hated smoking. keep up the good fight people, it does get easier.

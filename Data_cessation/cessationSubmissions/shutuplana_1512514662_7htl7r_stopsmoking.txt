Cold Turkey Precautions!!!

Tomorrow makes it a week since I quit smoking without a patch or gum, just cut out completely.
At work this morning I felt hungry yet nauseous, with hot flashes and dizziness.
Left early because I started feeling like my throat was closing up.
I work maybe 15 minutes from home and about 5 minutes away from home, I started feeling faint.
Got home, sat down, and when I got back up I blacked out and woke up on the floor having a panic attack.
The panic attack lasted for about 20 minutes while waiting for the ambulance (good job y’all lucky I ain’t dead)
When I told them I quit smoking they told me everything I was experiencing were symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.
I’m not posting this so you guys will feel bad or anything, it’s to bring awareness that it can (not always will) take a major physical toll in the first few days of your body readjusting.
If you do start feeling strange, get the nicotine gum but a small dose so you don’t have such a heavy withdrawal. (I have also been smoking for 9 years, at a pack a day for the last 4, so everyone is different.)
Just be mindful and stay safe

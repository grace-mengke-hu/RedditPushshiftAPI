6 months out, still having some odd issues

Smoked for 6 years, quit 6 months ago now (via vaping which I stopped doing 6 months ago). I've noticed my sex drive jump a scary amount, acne break outs in a very bad way, and my creative drive (writing) dry up almost entirely. 

Dunno if anyone else has had this issue, but I'd love some pointers, cus this shits getting old. 



Edit: I suppose I should state that the sex drive increase is actually a hindrance in my day to day (like in a real shit way), and I've had to get specialized acne crap for face/head... which... is so joyful /sarcasm. Any advice or anything would be helpful really.

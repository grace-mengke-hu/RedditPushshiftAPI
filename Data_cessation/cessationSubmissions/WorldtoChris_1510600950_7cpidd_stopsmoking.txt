Counting up

I relish smokes. There's something that activates my young philosopher mind that staring out a moon-lit window with a cigarette.

Quitting drinking seems easy compared to the mountain of quitting smoking. It really became part of my personality, my image, and my sanity.
  It disappoints me that an intelligent kid as myself got caught in the trap of cigarettes, and yet I feel relief in knowing I'm one man fighting the psychotic fuel of a multi-billion dollar industry, purely designed to keep me purchasing their product. 

I've been counting down to today, my Day One. And I've "quit" before, through cold turkey, or welbutrin, or patches, gum, and whatever else. But like my decision to quit drinking, this quit feels different. 
There hasn't been genuine desire. And whether it's a spiritual awakening or the realization that no one will get my shit together but me, I'm dead-set on moving past this phase in my life. 
Because after all the good I've felt passing along a cigarette to an addict in need, or the times of cheer celebrating outside the pub, or the moments of sadness puffing in -30C, it's never been me. It's automated, it's robotic, and it's an action taken to directly avoid something, whether it's boredom, anger, or repression.

Spiel aside, I don't want to play this industry's game anymore. I don't want to run away from my problems, and I want a sense of identity in something other than coughing lungs and foul odours. 
  
Instead of counting down the seconds since the last cigarette, the days since the last drink, I want to count up the dollars in my bank, and the memories I make with friends. 

It's Day one. Better start counting the days up too.
No smokes with you today, my friends.

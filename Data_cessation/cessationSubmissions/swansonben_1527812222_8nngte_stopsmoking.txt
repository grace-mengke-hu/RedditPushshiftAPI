It’s been nearly 200 days since I’ve quit smoking.

And this is honestly a struggle still every day, but I’m so much happier for it. 

I started out differently I’d imagine, never smoked when I was 18, but picked up the habit when I was 21. 

I got a job with long hours and was surrounded by other people who smoked and eventually fell into the habit. 

5 years of my life went out the window, cycling between trying to quit, chewing tobacco, vaping, and on and on. 

I had hid smoking or at least I thought I was from all of my friends and family. It had caused me to want to spend time alone rather than going to visit so that I wouldn’t have to hide my habit. 

Last November I decided that I had had enough. Made massive dietary changes, quit smoking cold turkey. 

I will not revert back. Smoking nicotine will never have a roll in my life again. 

If you’re thinking about quitting, do it. I know how difficult it is, but just one day is one day closer to breaking the habit.

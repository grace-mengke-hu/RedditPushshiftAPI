Please Help.

Been smoking three, four years now. Trying to quit but it's something I usually turn to when I'm stressed and life is stressful as of late. Either way, down to one and a half to two a day, accompanied by smoking the hookah to help me not reach for a pack... been feeling tired, lack of energy, nauseous.. wondering if this is bc of the reduced amount of nicotine. I miss it the most when driving. And when my friends all go outside to smoke and talk (I live with a lot of smokers and that's usually our social get-together time) I feel like crap and can't seem to go beyond one and a half to get to zero. Please help. Tired of feeling like crap. How long does this last? How do I completely stop without feeling like death?? And stop missing smoking during certain activities.. Thanks...

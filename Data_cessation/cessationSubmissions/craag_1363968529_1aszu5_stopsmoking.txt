As of today, I have saved $2,000 from not smoking.

And that's just from the cigarettes! When you consider that I often bought junk food or lottery ticket with my smokes, I imagine I've saved close to $3,000. 

I want to thank this sub for your help. I had tried to quit numerous times before with no luck. I don't know why, but something about that stupid badge is really motivating to me.

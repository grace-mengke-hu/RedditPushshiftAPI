Finally after two weeks I hit an abrupt drop in cravings

Today, 15 days cigarette free, I joined my boss outside so he could smoke. It didn't even hit me until a few hours later that I stood right in front of a lit cigarette and it didn't faze me.

Just another small victory, but I'm counting every single one and they're finally starting to add up.

As a bonus victory, I think my boss is encouraged by my progress and he's decided to quit smoking, as well.

I got really sick and quit four days ago.

So a little background, I've been smoking since I was 17. I've smoked for about eight years and have been at a pack a day for six years. It got to the point that I'd light up, start retching, and keep smoking. I'd smoke when I woke up, when I got to work, with my coffee, after I ate, when I drove, when I was stressed, when I drank, at a party, after sex, when I got home, before going to sleep, and any other moment I could squeeze five minutes. I tried to quit multiple times, but always caved and bought a pack. I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the routines, self-hate, and rationalizations. 

Last Tuesday, I woke up with a sore throat. Shortly after, I got a fever and coughed my lungs out. Despite how shitty I felt, I kept smoking for the next couple of days. Every time I lit up, I hated the taste and the constant coughing, but I kept forcing myself to to satisfy my nicotine fits. Then Thursday night, I realized how ridiculous this was and tossed my pack out of the car window. 

I woke up Friday morning and noticed a little blood in the mucous I coughed up. I couldn't breath, and while I felt hot I kept shivering. I thought, "Great!' I'm going to die as soon as i mustered up the courage to quit. I got myself to the hospital and found out I had early stage pneumonia. I got a whole bunch of meds and spent the rest of the weekend in bed. Through all of this, I haven't smoked a single cigarette!

Now, I'm feeling better. I really want an American Spirit, but I've made it too far. I know that smoking caused my cold to spiral out of control, and it doesn't make any sense to go back now. I'm starting to have to relearn my habits, but now I know I can do this. 

I want to thank everyone on r/stopsmoking. I've been subscribed for a year. Whenever one of your posts hit my front page, it would be a constant reminder that quitting is something that I need to do. Well, I'm here now, and I'm proud to be done with this bullshit.

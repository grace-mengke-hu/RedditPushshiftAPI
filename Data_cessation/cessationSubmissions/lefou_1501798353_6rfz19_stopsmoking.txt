Day 11 complaints.

I'm not working right now so I just have all this time to do nothing and feel all of the awfulness of cold-turkey withdrawal.  

"Just go get some exercise!" you say, but I was already having motivation issues before I quit smoking. Now I'm lucky if I convince myself to do just about anything all day. I don't know where the time even goes! 

My throat is scratchy. My body doesn't feel good. I don't really even want to smoke .... I just don't want to feel this way. 

I'm worried that I'm drawing out my recovery by being so inactive ... like my brain needs to work on things so that it can be retrained to do things without cigarettes .... like, I can't just sit here waiting for it to pass.  Problem is I have absolutely no motivation or external stress to get me to do anything.  

This sucks.

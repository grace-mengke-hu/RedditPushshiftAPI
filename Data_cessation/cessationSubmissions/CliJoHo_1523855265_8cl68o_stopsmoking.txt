Day 12 in the books! I feel great!

I can run longer playing soccer and the added oxygen levels are noticeable. I’m getting stuff done with the extra time on my hands.  So freeing when I realize I forgot Nic existed.  Still have cravings, but they are becoming more of an itch than painful.   I’m still getting intractable at times, but taking a walk works until I reset.

48 hours after last smoke; bronchitis?

I always have issues with my lungs, to the point that I don't even smoke unless I've been drinking because I will cough through an entire cigarette. It's been this way always. I've been regularly smoking while drinking for a few years. Anyways I put down the cigarettes two nights ago and I seriously feel like I have full blown bronchitis. I'm not suffering any cravings or anything, just cannot stop coughing. And coughing HARD. Even narcotic cough syrup won't touch it. Is there anything I can do other than just ride it out? Will taking a stop smoking aid help at all? I am miserable.

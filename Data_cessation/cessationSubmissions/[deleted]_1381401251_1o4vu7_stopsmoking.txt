How did you do it?

Hi there. This is my first post here; let me give you some background. I've been smoking for about 4 years. I know it's bad for me. I know it's costing me more money that I can't reasonably afford. But the thing is, I think I fucking like it. I don't know if I'm wasting my time here - can somone relate to me?

It's simple, honest!

Wise words from a very good friend who is five years off the smokes (and alcohol!)....

"When you quit smoking, don't identify yourself as a non-smoker. By identifying as a non-smoker the pressure to maintain that image is huge and overbearing. Equally, don't identify as a person who 'quit' smoking. Best not to identify as anything in regards to smoking. By doing so, smoking becomes nothing, it doesn't even register."

I smoked for six years, I never thought I'd be able to quit. Always said I never had enough willpower. And once I stopped identifying with that, the process was so so easy. I have zero cravings, my skin is glowing and my body will love me for it. It's only been nine weeks but I don't feel like ever having another one! Hurrah!

Today is the day!

I subscribed to this sub years ago I think.  Only to not pay attention at all.  But after I got up to about a pack a day (after about 8 years of half a pack) I got sick, and the doctor and my therapist recommended Allan Carrs Easy Ways to Quit Smoking.  After reading it twice, I made my plan, and today is the day.  I just smoked my last cigarette and I've never felt so comfortable and confident that I am in fact quitting and considering myself a non-smoker.  

Clearly time will tell as to whether I'm successful, but in any case I highly reccomend reading his book!

Anyhow, I just wanted to tell strangers that might actually believe in me.  I know whichever friends I tell would support me, but naturally give me the standard, 'riiiight, you quit again, we'll see how long this lasts' given how many times I've announced that I'm going to quit.  But this time is different, I feel really great and positive about it!

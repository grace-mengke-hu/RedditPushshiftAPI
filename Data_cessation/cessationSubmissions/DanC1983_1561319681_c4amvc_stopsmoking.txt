Am about 2/3rds of the way through the Easy Way by Allen Carr. Iâ€™m looking for app suggestions....

Am getting ready to light my last cigarette ever in the next few days! (Actually excited about that)

However I also know I am sucker for gamification and seeing visual representations of my progress.

So do any of you shiny non smokers out there have app suggestions that track your progress, give you little attaboys and kinda cheer you through?

Let me know.

Looking forward to joining the the ranks of the Shiny!

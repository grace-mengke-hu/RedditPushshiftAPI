3 weeks!!

I am glad that I am doing this. Smoking is so destructive in many ways, it just had to go from my life. I never want to return to it. The benefits are all lies, I have tried smoking long enough to discover that. The idea that smoking reliefs stress is completely wrong, because it also is it's own source of stress, and in addition using smoking as a crutch is doing the opposite from making you more stress tolerant. 

Now I see my whole house becoming addicted; I live with a bunch of students, and at first they said they only smoked at parties, but now I see the group chat being used to coordinate smoking sessions many times per week. The consequence of me not joining is that I become a bit of an outsider, but that's totally worth it to me.

Also trying to quit drinking. I was doing well for a week, but yesterday I drank again. However, now that I quit smoking, I know that I can do this. You have to be done with it enough to not care about the small and big challenges that are associated with letting go of the habit. With smoking that is true, but I find myself thinking that drinking does have benefits and that I just need it to be 'normal'.

However, I am in the process of quitting that too, and convincing myself and failed attempts are just part of that. I will also be successful at this eventually.

Good luck on your own journey!

Opening up helped me keep motivated

I recently realized that telling other people that I’m quitting (coworkers, friends, classmates) is surprisingly helpful. Many weren’t even aware that I smoked at all but are eager to help or to cheer me on. 

Recently I asked my boss about the company’s tobacco free policy and if extends to nicotine patches and gum (we get tested often) and before he said anything, he said “congrats” 

It’s such a small thing but it helped reaffirm how good of an idea it is to quit, even if I’m feeling miserable without that cigarette right now. 

I have people close to me being a lot more supportive and never in a condescending way. 

This just became a lot easier.

Almost Fell in it Again

My journey is sort of weird â€” I never really smoked cigs. I started with spliffs, eventually ripping like 6-8 spliffs a day, and drunk cigs on weekends. I wanted to quit smoking so I took up vaping... and it made it 5x worse and I became a juul pod every other day vaper.

I quit all this a couple months ago, but recently decided to smoke a blunt with a friend. It was nice! I loved it! And I was interested because back when I smoked spliffs I never smoked blunts because it was tooo much weed.

So the next day I smoked another blunt 

And again the next day

And again the day after...

I realized that I really liked it because the small amount of nicotine in the wrap. It was a way to cheat - I had quit cigs, vapes, and spliffs but a blunt was OK in my mind. However this was a bad line of reasoning - nicotine is nicotine no matter how small and I was forming a habit again!

So I stopped a few days ago - back to nicotine free.

This oral fixation is for your mom and also she owes me a grilled cheese sandwich for last night.

You can't just consume huge quantities of sugar-free mints without repercussions. 

OK, I get it. These are "mints", and it's like this... 
You reach for the box (of mints). 
You remove one (a mint). 
You insert that in your piehole and ruminate until it's gone. 
This is convenient, because it doesn't require an incendiary device, or any sort of fire, or vaping, or any shitty smells at all. 
Great. Repeat 50 times an hour! 

WRONG NO NO NO BUT NOT A FAIL. 

Sugar-free mints? Yeah, manufactured sugar substitutes. Your mileage may vary. But for me, with ingredients like Xylitol and Sorbitol, it's a horrendous, tedious, smelly trip to shit-town, and the only stops along the way are for the numerous and highly questionable gaseous events. You know the ones. 

Fucking mints. I fucking hate the lack of bad breath. What the fuck are you hiding by not being repulsive??? 

BUT NOT A FAIL BECAUSE: I haven't smoked in 19 days. Good luck ya'll.

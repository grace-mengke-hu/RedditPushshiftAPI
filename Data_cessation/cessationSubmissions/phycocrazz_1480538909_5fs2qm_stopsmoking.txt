4 days smoke free!

I know it's not a massive achievement but for the first time in 6 years of smoking and trying to stop I have made it past day 4! It's a huge achievement for me I am so proud of myself and just wanted to tell someone who would understand. Being told I can't have surgery without quitting has really lit a fire under my ass!

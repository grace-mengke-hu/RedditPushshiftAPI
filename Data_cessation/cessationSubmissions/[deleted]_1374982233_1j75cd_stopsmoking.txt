Coming back to this subreddit to see that my badge says 360 days.... When It's really only been 6.

I didn't realise how long it has been since I tried to quit last (only lasted a few days then). It just made me see how complacent I am about smoking and how it has just become part of my life. What I thought was a few months has been nearly a year. Resetting my badge, wish me luck!

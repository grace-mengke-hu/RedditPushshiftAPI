Proud of myself! 12-13 days since I quit.

I had smoked cigarettes regularly from 19-26/7. Past few years I've vaped(turning 29 August), and had cigarettes every now and then. 

A person in my family got a rather aggressive form of lung cancer, most likely from smoking and was given just a few weeks... and having to see how quickly they went downhill(still kicking, though) I just knew it was time.

I am disabled and that was another reason for it.. Being disabled I am less active and don't need anything extra that's going to be harmful to my health.

This is my third attempt that didn't end the next morning, and my longest by a week. Been chewing gum and sucking on hard candy(less and less by day). I know this is the time. Past few days I've only had 2-3 cravings during the day. 

I'm actually hardly thinking about it. 

One of the best things about this is that, my father a smoker of 35 years quit 6 days ago(his longest attempt) due to same family member and seeing me end my addiction on nicotine. My mother couldn't be happier.

If we can do it, so can you!

Side note: Once you start vaping from smoking you notice a increase in smells/taste... You notice an even bigger change after you quit vaping!!

Anyone else that hates people who smoke in public near other people?

I have never smoked a cigarette so I'm not trying to quit, but I think it would be pretty bad for people who are trying to quit as well. Fuck all people who smoke in closed spaces near other people, of course excluding smoker areas. I once saw somebody smoking next to the no smoking sign in a closed space.

Attempting to quit smoking.

Hey guys, 
I've been putting this off, and making promises to myself, my family, and friends. I am twenty three and have a daughter whos a year and a half, and another little girl on the way.  
I've been smoking for about three and a half years and have found it more than difficult to put cigarettes down. The last seven months have been increasingly difficult due to back pain which I am sure would cease to exist once I stopped putting these toxins in my boddy. I just bought a home and would like to put all of the money Im spending on smokes towards renovation. 
    I've heard that you can't really quit unless you truly want to, I do want it. I guess that what Im wanting to say it that I need some extra help getting motivated. Im going to the doctor this weekend to acquire chantix and medication for my back because if Im being honest I feel my health dwindling. Can you guys help me out?

Day Two (Hour 39), first unbearable craving.

I turned 20 this week and had planned for a month for my quit day to be the date after my birthday. Figured I wanted to start my twenties smoke free. Anyways, I smoked about 8/day for 1 year~socially for 2 years. Not too bad. I had a few cravings yesterday, my first full day (kicked in pretty badly when I saw people smoking on my walk home), but today was a stressful day at work and I'm now at my friend's house for a few hours, a friend I would always smoke with - she hasn't quit yet. Although I made her promise to not let me bum any, the temptation is strong, because (and this is the kicker) my ID expired Monday so I can't legally buy cigarettes until my new one comes in. That helps with quitting, but makes the temptation stronger when I'm with someone else and could bum. How can I stay strong? I've already been trying gum, seeds, etc. to keep my mouth busy. Typing to keep my hands busy at the moment. Thanks so much everyone!! This subreddit is making quitting easier already

44 days!!

Can't believe it has been that many days since I had my last smoke. 

I suffered from horrible flatulence and diarrhea in first 3 weeks but my stomach is absolutely fine now :)

It feels great not to be dependent on an external subject to feel good. 

I still do get cravings  - have been having stressful days at work - and on more than a few evenings, I have felt a desperate need to smoke. 

Going strong though - intend to keep this up for the rest of my life :D

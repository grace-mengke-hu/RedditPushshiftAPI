4 Months!! Beginners you can do this too.

Just wanted to check in here and tell all of you beginners it does get easier.  You will think of it less and less...thank god.  Just have to remember you will get the occasional craving but they get easier to get through.  Just have to tell yourself smoking isn't an option anymore.  Come here for support and read Allen Carrs book Easy Way to Quit too.  It is even a good read if you have already quit.  

Cant believe it has been 4 months since I quit.  I've saved almost 800 dollars now.  Merry Christmas to all of you ex-smokers!

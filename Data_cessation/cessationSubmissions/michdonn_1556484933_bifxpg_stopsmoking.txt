Question for long term quitters

I have tried to stop smoking numerous times and failed miserably. I’ve been nicotine free for 13 days and this time just feels different, I really don’t have any desire to smoke. My Q is, did you know deep down in your gut that was the end of the relationship and you’ve never gone back?

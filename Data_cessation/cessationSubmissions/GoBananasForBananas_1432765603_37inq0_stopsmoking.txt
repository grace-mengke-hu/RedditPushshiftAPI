How can I help my boyfriend stop smoking?

I know it will have to be a decision he comes to by himself at a time when he is ready. He has already cut back a lot and has expressed an interest in quitting one day. I don't want to nag him. I'm looking for tips/suggestions/tricks/etc that will help me help him! Any and all feedback appreciated!!

Alrighty 112 days!! Say Whattt

27 F

It's strange how different life is.
I was about a pack a day smoker. More when partying of course. 
I was always sick. ALWAYS.
My health was shit.
I ate shit. Didn't exercise.
I had anxiety all the time. I thought perfume and lotion covered my smell up. 
What started as a "I'm such a badass" turned into a decade of hell and disappointment.
Every once in awhile a cig will cross my mind. Especially when I'm stressed. Living with a smoker teaches me ALOT of willpower.
I quit drinking because that was a trigger. It was the best decision of my life.
I had my first trip as a non smoker and it went easier than I thought! I carried lots of gum. I would even go outside with smokers and didn't smoke.
My nails are long and clear! 
I smell all kinds of things.
I have money(seriously gotta start saving)
I spoil myself! 
Coffee. So much coffee. I make a mean cappuccino. 
I buy luxury food items!
I can afford make up, not cheap shit.
I have hope for the future.
Quit smoking app has helped keep me accountable. 
My hair,skin,smile and appearance is 100% better.
I have the most confidence ever.
I'm proud to say I'm a non smoker. It's not easy. Day by day.  I thought about posting on fb but decided those that know me are proud and I guess I didnt need to  brag about it.
One year ago I was in a very dark place. I didn't care how shitty my health was. I would scrounge up change for smokes instead of gas or food.
There is a light!! All positive changes.
A huge thank you to this sub and random strangers on here offering advice or just listening. 
I have faith in myself. Heres to New beginnings. I have faith in YOU too!

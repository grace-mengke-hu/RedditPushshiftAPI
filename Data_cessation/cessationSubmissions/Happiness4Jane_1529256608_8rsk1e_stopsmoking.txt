If I can through this without smoking, I never need to smoke again

Over the past few days I’ve been going through a break up with a man I was engaged to marry. And I haven’t lit up. Haven’t even considered it to be an option. 18 days a nonsmoker now. If I can get though a break up without a cigarette, I truly never need to smoke again.

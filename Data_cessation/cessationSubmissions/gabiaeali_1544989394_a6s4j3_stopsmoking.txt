Finally, a great day!

I am on day 8 and this has been the easiest day! No cigarette cravings and I barely want nicotine gum. 

I feel lime I'm over a big obstacle, and so glad I threw my cigarettes out! My mood has improved, my negative thinking has subsided, and my teeth are already brightening up. 

Hang in there folks, you're on your way to a great day too!

Almost 3 months smoke free and I smoked a cigar without thinking about it

After becoming a truck driver my cigarette intake went from half a pack a day to a full pack. Once the new year kicked in I decided to call it quits for good. I just now came to a truck stop where they had a cigar shop full of fancy cigars. Ive only smoked the junky gas station cigars years ago and I wanted to try the fancy ones. I bought 3. One to try now and 2 to take home and share with friends.

After lighting up and taking the first drag I felt that same nicotine high and I thought to myself shit....did I just relapse without realizing? Cigars and cigarettes have always seemed like 2 different worlds to me.

Cigerettes=gross unclassy cancer sticks
Cigars= Occasional treat to have with the guys

I didnt even realize there was nicotine in cigars until doing some research after smoking it. I think Ill be fine though. The buzz I got from it actually made me feel terrible because it felt like I cheated and the thought of secumbing to my urges and buying cigarettes is just out of the question. I havent gone 3 freaking months to just start smoking again. However, I realize cigars could be a slippery slope if not handled properly.

You deserve to treat yourself DAILY

Hey all,

Just thought I'd mention what has been getting me through these last 15 days going cold Turkey.

Keeping hydrated, having a good supply of gum/sugar free sweets and a stress ball has been paramount. Also, lollipops are good too!

The number one thing though is the fact that you should treat yourself DAILY. I cant stress that enough. Telling yourself you're not going to smoke today is great, but treating yourself at the end of the day reinforces the fact that you're doing a great job and will continue to push you in the right direction.

Spend the money you would have saved in a fund and use it daily. Anything is better than spending it on cigarettes. Heck, even if you threw that money in the bin would be better that the harms cigarettes would cause you.

So buy that body butter, have a relaxing bath, buy those candles, get that action figure, buy that video game, buy a gift for your spouse or family member, go to the movies, go out for dinner or even start a collection!

You deserve this. You're amazing. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise. Giving up smoking isn't an easy thing to do and you're doing something that thousands of people cannot do in their lifetime. Be proud!

You got this!

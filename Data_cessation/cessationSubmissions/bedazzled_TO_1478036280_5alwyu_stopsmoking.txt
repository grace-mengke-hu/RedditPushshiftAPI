question for those who smoke when they drink

hi! first time reddit poster. 
i'm a casual smoker. i smoke somewhere in the range of 5-30 cigarettes a week, but this is dependent on how much i drink as i only smoke when i am drinking. so if i drink once a week, i might have 5-8 cigarettes, twice a week, maybe up to twenty etc. 
the only people in my life who know that i smoke are those that i drink with, so most people at work or family do not know that i smoke.  
i'd really like to give up the casual cigarettes while drinking, but i really enjoy them ! does anyone have any tips or is anyone in a similar situation?

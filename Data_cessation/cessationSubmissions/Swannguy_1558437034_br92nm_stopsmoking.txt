Day 4 since Quit, but using NRT

The last time I tried to quit I did it cold turkey and lasted for nearly two weeks through the insane withdrawals and cravings. Decided that “one smoke” couldn’t hurt, which I did 3 or 4 times (buying a pack, smoking 1 &amp; throwing the rest of the pack out).  That eventually led, of course, to going back to full time smoking.  
This time I decided to do the patch &amp; inhaler &amp; zyban. I don’t find the cravings so bad, but of course I’m still getting nicotine. I’m concerned that using the inhalers is just prolonging the process as it almost feels like smoking with that hand to mouth action. Going to see if I can wean myself off the inhaler asap, but at least feel good I’m not inhaling all the other crap from cigarettes. 
I kinda feel like a wimp for using NRT and makes me wonder that if I’m still getting nicotine, have I REALLY quit or am I an imposter?

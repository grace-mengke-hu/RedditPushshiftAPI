Sixty Days

Hit sixty days today, 400 quid saved, 1200 cigs not smoked.  I used to be a pack a day smoker for 5+ years.


I'm especially pleased because I have been going through a stressful period over the last month.


I'm going on a long flight soon, first time since I stopped and I am looking forward to not desperately wanting to smoke the whole way.


My advice to others is that stopping smoking is largely a mental challenge after the first few days and weeks.  I recommend fortifying yourself mentally, read whyquit, read the Alan Carr book (even if he does sound like a used car salesman at times), read about the tobacco industry, check in this sub, observe people who still smoke.
 

All the evidence shows smoking to be just not worth it, all you need is the genuine desire to stop and the willingness to pro actively travel down that path.

10 days

After five years smoking, I'm doing pretty good.

I subscribed to this reddit pretty recently, and honestly didn't think I would be posting here at all. Two months ago I moved to San Francisco from New York; I had hoped to quit smoking when I moved here, but between one thing and another - a roommate who smokes, acceptance of my smoking at my job, a constant stream of meet-ups-with-old-friends over beer, not wanting to be stressed while I was applying for jobs and looking for a place to live - I didn't manage to, and was up to around 3/4 of a pack a day. 

Then, the Sunday before last, I woke up without cigarettes, and I didn't feel like buying a pack. So I didn't. And it's been ten days now. I'm still kind of shocked by it. I quit two years ago for five months, but it was a much more brute force "I'm quitting" approach, which didn't work out. Since then, I've tried to quit dozens and dozens of times, always with some sort of overarching desire to change my life. I didn't have that this time, and it seems to be working. 

One of the things I've found helpful in quitting, which I haven't seen given as advice elsewhere, is not to put too much stock in quitting. Just don't smoke. Also, my problem was I love smoking; I love taking breaks, going outside after the end of a long day, enjoying a cigarette in the park. I've been making sure that I still do those things. I go for walks around the block at work, I make sure to go sit outside with my roommate on the steps in the morning and evening. That way, I don't feel like I'm cutting out the reflective part of my life. It's not that hard to just stand there and not smoke, for some reason. I have no idea why. Like I said, I'm still kind of bewildered. 

Anyway, thought I'd share.

Day 8

The hardest days were 3, 4, and 5, but now I can honestly say I'm 100% not a smoker and never will be again. Feels great! I had to warn my friends and girlfriend that I might be a bitch for a few days and that I'd be keeping my distance. Best decision I could have made. Stayed away from drinking and friends that smoke and even though it's only day 8, I can tell I'm never going back. Good luck to all you guys!

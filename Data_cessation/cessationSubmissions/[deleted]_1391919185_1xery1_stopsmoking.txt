I don't even like cigarettes anymore, but I can't seem to stop.

So I've been smoking for a few years now, since I was 16/17. Started due to having most of my friends smoke, etcetc. Enjoyed every cigarette in this period until about a month ago. 

I started getting serious about my health and around this time cigarettes just started making me feel awful. Like stomach ache, tired, headache, don't taste like they used to. 

Now every time I finish a pack I remind myself how much I just didn't enjoy them and promise myself not to buy another. Then the next morning comes and I go to the corner store first thing.

I'm really serious about it this time. More out of self-loathing at my lack of willpower than anything, I've decided I'm done.

What I am asking is how to get over the *boredom* from not smoking? When I'm driving or on campus in between classes with my friends all I do is smoke cigarettes. When I'm at a party and not talking to anyone I go smoke a cigarette. I just don't know what I'm going to do with myself during this time now...

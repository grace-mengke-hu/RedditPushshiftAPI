Resisted my first real temptation!

A couple of days ago, my friend and I were out running errands. While we were in the car, she lit up a cigarette. As soon as she did, she apologized since she forgot I had quit smoking and didn't want to trigger me. I told her it was fine, she had the window down anyways, but I did let her know I was really craving a cig. She asked if I wanted her to forbid me from smoking one (she usually would give me one and I had none at the time). As much as I hated to say it, I told her that I wanted to stop for good, so she refused to give me any after that.

So yeah, I did have help in resisting. I'm sure if I'd really wanted a cigarette badly enough, and I was convinced her I wouldn't regret it, she would have given me one. I'm also thankful to have friends that care about helping me reach my goals :) Hoping maybe I can help my friend quit someday too!

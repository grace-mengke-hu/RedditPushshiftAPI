Some Motivational Excerpts From past posts

This place is truly something special. For young smokers especially. I found that none of my friends truly understood what it meant to quit and none of my smoker friends could understand why I'd want to. Being a quitter in your 20's is an awkward place. That being said I don't go out to bars every weekend, or whathave you, opting for the occasional whiskey with some video games instead. 

I don't know if it's realizing you made a choice for the better, or what exactly; I think the craving will be be a part of me for the rest of my life. That's not a bad thing though, to understand addiction puts you in a unique mindset. Not everyone has had that experience. I think it's good to have the wolf at the door, it keeps you sharp so to speak. 

I have binged on alcohol and caffeine, but neither of those have come close to that seductive quiet voice that is a cigarette. It's another mouth to feed, a tertiary need like hunger or thirst. But it doesn't satisfy not in the same way. After the first two in a day you just feel worse and worse, till it is like an obligation, not a pleasure. If you haven't quit yet, you know what I'm talking about. 

I miss smoking in the romantic sense one misses their ex-lovers. You realize that you are much better off without them despite the good times. Smoking is childish, as a teenager I didn't care for the future and didn't think I'd see it. But I want to live a long and happy life, and part of that is being healthy. 

I know it's nice to get away for 5 minutes. But that should be an option, not a need. As a need it's no longer 5 minutes for you. I saw a couple smokers today on my way to work, and I can tell you they didn't look like they were enjoying themselves in the rain.
It does get easier, I don't think about it everyday as I did -in the first ten especially. To all you quitters, good luck and think of all the money and life you save. After all you're going to have more of both.

I've told myself I was going to quit dozens of times. Every time I smoke again after promising that the last cigarette would be my final one, I betray myself. I cheat my future self out of time, money, and energy. I make promises to myself and then break them. Sometimes I tell my girlfriend I'm quitting, and she cheers me on and supports me. Or I tell my friends that I'm quitting, hoping that if they see me succeed maybe they'll have faith that they can too.

Then I smoke again. Sometimes I try to hide it for a while. I brush my teeth or chew gum to mask the smell. I make excuses to get away for a few minutes to get my fix. I try to distort reality so they won't know the truth. Eventually they find out or I give up pretending.

Every time it reinforces the belief that I'm not in control, that I can't trust myself. That I am limiting my potential and have no one to blame but myself. That I may never escape the cycle and be who I want to be.

**For me, smoking gradually erodes my confidence and faith in myself, and to me that's the worst thing I can imagine happening. Worse than destroying my body, worse than sabotaging my attractiveness and social status, worse than wasting my money and time, worse than any other effect. It makes me less of a man and goes against all of my values, and those are the things that give my life real value and purpose.**

So yes, smoking will impact your quality of life. Don't ever start.

**Some Points On Allen Carr Easy Way**

The main point I didn't realise before reading the book was how nicotine addiction actually works. The idea that all non-smokers are at a default level of "stress" whilst a smoker spends 90% of their time over this line was horrifying to me. A cigarette will briefly bring the smoker back to near a "normal" level before steadily increasing the stress levels until the next fix. It makes so much sense. It provides answers to the many paradoxes of smoking. This book provides great reasons for why every belief you have about smoking stems from being an addict. Social smokers included.

I could go much further into the book, but the simplest thing if you're trying to quit smoking would be to just read it yourself. You won't regret it. It's simple to justify reasons for failed quits when you don't understand how addiction works. Reading this book will arm you with the tools to understand exactly why you feel like you do with regards to nicotine and help you in the fight to break free.

It is not this book that is the magic trick. It is smoking itself

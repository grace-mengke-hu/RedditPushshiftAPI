First week

Hi! I’m heading towards my first week without cigarettes in ten years. I’m 25 and been smoking since I was 15. I have tried to stop before but only for 3 - 4 days. I have never been this far and I’m pretty proud and feeling so good! 
The last weekend I went out for drinks on both Friday and Saturday with friends who smoke and I didn’t have a single on! 
Just wanted to get my success out! 
Have a nice day everyone

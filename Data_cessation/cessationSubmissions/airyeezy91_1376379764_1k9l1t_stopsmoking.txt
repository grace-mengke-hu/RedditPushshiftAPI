"It'll be easy"-Good or bad mindset?

Well guys, tonight is the night. Tonight I will smoke my last cigarette ever. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the smell, the cost, the bodily damage...I'm sick of it all. 

I'm like 30 pages from the end of easyway and don't plan on looking back. The book has really helped me to identify, and overcome, the main reason I was putting off stopping: FEAR. 

A little bit about myself. I'm 22 in a couple of weeks and have been smoking "full time" for 3 years. At peak I smoked 20 a day (sometimes a few more) but recently I've cut it right down to around 5 or 6. This is mainly due to work as I can't smoke whilst I'm there. I have my morning cigarette at 7am and then don't smoke again until usually around 7pm, sometimes later. 

This 12hrs abstaining a day has made me think one thing: It'll be easy to quit!

This is due mainly to the low amount of cravings I get over the course of those 12hrs and that when I do get them, I think "Is this all it is?" I don't know if this is a good mindset to have or if I'll go into it with this positive way of thinking and then be shocked by the withdrawls/difficulty over the first week or so. I mean the cravings can't possibly be the same after just 12hrs as they are after 48 or 72?

I should make one thing clear. When I stop, I STOP. I won't be the guy who wants to quit smoking but can't. This is my first attempt at quitting and I intend on it being my last. This is another thing why fear is a big part for me...I can't stop thinking that when that last cigarette is out, THAT'S IT! I know it's all just a mind trick though and that annoys me even more. 

Anyway guys, thanks for listening and any feedback is greatly appreciated. No doubt I'll be posting here a couple more times over the coming days.

Stopped smoking 256 days ago

I am 33. After 15 years of smoking, I quit 256 days ago. I quit after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. If you smoke, read it. You will quit.

-withdrawal sucks. Mine lasted 5 days and consisted of trouble sleeping, the chills and waking up in cold sweats.
-cravings happen but they always go away. It's like craving a cookie and stopping yourself from eating it. You feel great for resisting after the craving goes away.
-slowly but surely you will start to breathe again. Smokers don't breathe like non smokers. Quit and you will see what I mean. My lung capacity took about 5 months to begin to improve. At 8.5 months, I can now fill my lungs with air.
-your smoker friends will all secretly be jealous. Every smoker wants to quit.
-at 8.5 months, smoking has never smelled worse. And that's how I smelled.
-my dark circles disappeared after about 5 months. My skin colour has gone from grey to pink. 
-I've gained 15 lbs but am now on my way to losing it. Although I've gained this weight, people tell me I look better than ever.

Just do it. Go buy Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking and quit. You won't regret it!

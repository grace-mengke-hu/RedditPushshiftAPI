4 Days in - Am I supposed to distract myself?

Hey all,

I haven't had a smoke since 2am on the first and I'm not enjoying it... I assume I'm supposed to distract myself so I've been watching Scrubs non-stop(ish). My question is - Am I going about quitting the right way?

Incase it's relevant, I'm 17 and I've been smoking almost 3 years and about 2 packs a week.

Thanks for any advice!

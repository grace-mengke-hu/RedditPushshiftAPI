Has anyone used Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking?

Does it really work? I bought it and quite honestly, I'm afraid of what's going to happen to me if I read it. I have a strong desire to quit. I mean, I've only been a smoker for five years, and already a strong part of my identity is wrapped up in cigarettes. I've depended on cigarettes as a social crutch, to calm myself, get me through the hell that is early sobriety, give me a break from life, etc. I just don't know how I'll do life without my pause button, my security blanket. 
God that sounds sad as hell.

Well, I dropped that ball

So, I quit at the end of June and was actually having a pretty easy time with it.  Recently, however, I slipped. I should elaborate that I didn't really feel like I NEEDED or WANTED to smoke, I just DID. I bought a pack out of curiosity, smoked a couple and tossed it.  A week later I did the same.  

I've now been smoking a few a day for the last week or so and am feeling pretty upset about it. I'm going to have to reset my badge here, although I'm not looking at it like I'm starting over - I'm looking at it as if I overcame another mountain: I slipped and realized that is not what I wanted and I was completely more happy when I was proud of myself for quitting after thinking I was a slave for the majority of my adult life.

Good luck my friends and be weary - slips can happen even when you think you have it beat.  

PS: I'm excited to tackle this again for some reason.

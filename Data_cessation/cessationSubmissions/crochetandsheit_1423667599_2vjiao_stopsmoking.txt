I don't remember how many days it's been...

I decided not to count every single day for my own well being, the less I think about smoking the better. 

I quit in early January 2015, and I do still get strong cravings. I tried e-smokes for a bit but they made me want to smoke again. I just wanted to say I can now have a craving, then do something positive and feel good about it. That is a big milestone for me. 

I have a variety of things I do instead of having a smoke but up until today it never quite satiated the craving, just pushed it back. But not anymore! That is the most gratifying feeling, and I finally feel like I've made progress! I just wanted to share that. 

Edit: Just realized the badge tells me exact days and not just generality of weeks, so now I know how many days, but I won't be committing that to memory.

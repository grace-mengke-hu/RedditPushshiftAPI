Day 150 - A few tips

First I'd like to thank all of you who contribute to this subreddit. Based mostly on *user experience* it helps more than anything else.

I just turned 36, was a smoker for 16 years, I started when I was 20. Stupid, I know. I smoked one and a half pack of Marlboro 100's each day, two when I was working hard or when I was frustrated, smoked even more when I was hanging out with my friends. I tried to quit for like 6 times in the past 8 or 9 years, the longest non-smoking period was 2 months. I loved to smoke, but I couldn't really tell why I was smoking. Not that one needs an excuse to do something but smokers (and other addicts) usually tend to look for an excuse. And while it's hard to find a meaningful reason to smoke, it's very difficult to find one for quitting as well. I had no reason to quit. No health issues (no caughing at all ever), no job related issues (I work at home), nothing. Besides the smell and the fact that more and more people hate me every day, I couldn't find a reason to quit. I just **WANTED** to quit. I guess that's why I finally had success.

I'm not sure I can really inspire people to quit but I can share a few tips and some of my experiences after being clean for 150 days.

- **QUIT. JUST. NOW.** There's no such thing as *"I'm done, I'm gonna quit tomorrow."* (or *"next week"* etc.) Your mind is fooling you into a state where you believe you're actually quitting. No, you're not. It's easy to say that when there's still a half a pack in your pocket or there's a smoking stick between your fingers. (I know Cracked is not really welcomed on reddit but [this is still a recommended reading](http://www.cracked.com/article_20028_5-ways-your-brain-tricks-you-into-sticking-with-bad-habits.html) )

- Specific dates or occasions are generally good for quitting but do not plan ahead to quit on such dates, just do it. *"Oh, it's my mom's birthday, fuck it, I'm done, I quit"* People like to measure. This subreddit's flair helps you to measure the number of days since you quit. It's very helpful.

- Cold turkey. Other methods didn't work for me. Destroy all the remaining cigarettes in your entire environment. Not just put it in the waste bin, but destroy it, stomp on it, flush it, whatever. My GF had almost a full pack of some girly cigarettes, I destroyed it as well.

- No substitutes at all! No pills, no patches, no e-cigs, nothing. Quit.

- It's gonna be really tough if the ones you live with still do smoke. You'll be tempted to steal cigarettes, get a drag and so on. Maybe it's time for you all to quit. Fortunately my SO is a non-smoker.

- I relapsed only twice during the first week and only for a single cigarette both times. Fortunately, I felt guilty immediately. When the need hits you the feeling is strong but you have to be stronger and repeat yourself that "I don't smoke". Just ignore it. It's gonna take a couple of minutes to completely forget about it. Browsing this subreddit is also good.

- Stop complaining and whining about how hard is the process or how shitty you feel at the moment. Do not brag about it either. No one cares. Non-smokers still secretly hate you for your habit, smokers just simply can't make you feel better.

- Read this subreddit instead. Help some guy to quit. Just one guy you don't know at all. That will inspire you more to continue.

- Right before quitting I started to hate myself for being a smoker. I hated that suddenly the entire world was aginst me because I'm a smoker. I'm not sure if hating myself helped me quit, but don't hate yourself. You're not the worst enemy of mankind who poisons others. You're a quitter. Be proud, you're doing great.

- Some say the need will stay for about six months. I'm at the the 5th and the need is finally gone. It was fucking worth it. I feel better, I smell better, my senses are better, I hope I get healthier, and I have more money to spend. What else do you need?

- Quitting is not THAT hard. It's hard for sure but there are so many so much harder things in life you have to deal with.

- My GF is proud of me. One of the best things happened to me in the past 150 days whan she said that. She just told me that she really hated my habbit.

- It's also good when your smoker friends in a bar are asking you if you want one and you just say "No thanks, I quit". First they're not gonna believe you but secretly going to admire you. Later they'll think that you're so fucking strong. You'll see it in their eyes. And it's a good thing.

- It also helps if you try convincing someone to quit. Even if they can't quit, it makes you feel stronger.

Finally not a tip but a request:
- Do not ever become a prick who hates smokers. You of all should know better ;)

Thanks for listening.

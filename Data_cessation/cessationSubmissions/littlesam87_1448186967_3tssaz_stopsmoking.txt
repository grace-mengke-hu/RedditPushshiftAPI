It's not getting easier

I've been quit for two weeks tomorrow and it is not getting any easier! I have been ill for the whole two weeks which is definitely not helping. I'm not getting to feel any of the benefits of quitting as I can't breathe properly and I can't smell anything anyway :(

Keeping my fingers crossed that this illness passes asap!

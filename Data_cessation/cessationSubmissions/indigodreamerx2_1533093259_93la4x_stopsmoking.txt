Chantix/4 Days Smoke Free

I am really struggling right now. I started Chantix 5 days ago, quit smoking 4 days ago (odd circumstances). The Chantix is making me so depressed I am struggling to get out of bed. But I am also really, really struggling with not smoking. 
  I don't know if it's better to take the Chantix until I am 30 days out, or stop it now with a high chance of resuming smoking. I have been on vacation where I can't smoke, but I go home tomorrow to 2 smokers. I'm feeling so conflicted...

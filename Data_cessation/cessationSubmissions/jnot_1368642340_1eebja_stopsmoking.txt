Nicotine patch stepdown difficulty

I'm 37 days in on a quit and just made the jump from 21mg to 14mg patch.  The anxiety/ inability to concentrate that had been there at the start is coming back in a big way.  Has anyone done a whole course of nicotine patches?  Is going through this anxiety and readjustment every time you dial back the dose worth it vs. just going cold turkey??

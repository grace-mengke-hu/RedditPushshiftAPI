Reminders why smoking sucks.

I am writing this so I can refer back to it every time I think I want to smoke. It's too easy to for get these reasons when you have a craving to smoke.
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ONE CIGARETTE. IF I HAVE ONE, I START THE WHOLE CYCLE AGAIN.

Smoking gives me a headache.
Smoking gives me a sore throat.
Smoking makes me lethargic.
Smoking and craving cigarettes makes me anxious. The sense of failure I have from smoking makes me depressed.
Smoking makes me lie to my family in order to go and smoke.
It makes me ugly. My eyes are dull, my skin is horrible and my teeth will go yellow and stained, and Ill see this every time I look in the mirror.
I will most probably shorten my life and die of a horrible illness if I don't completely and forever stop.

The only way to stop all of this (and more) is to break the cycle completely and realise no situation in my life is better from smoking!

This is my second post on here. I am so disappointed in myself that Im still struggling with this, but I am. I had stopped, but then I caved and smoked with a friend, and am back in my hole. I am determined to pull myself out of this. 
My problem seems to be me thinking that Ill "treat" myself to smoking at special times, but let's face it, those times need to be enjoyable without it!!!

Ok, I think that's all I needed to tell myself for now.

Love reading all the success stories and inspiration on here, keep them coming!

How long until I start to feel like I can get back into shape?

Next month will be a year for me! *quick dance*

While I have certainly improved, fitness wise, I don't feel like I'm making the cardiovascular progress I should be. 

I'm working out at least 3 times a week, eating healthy, and not smoking. I'm stronger and quicker but cardio is still my nemesis and I can't go more that 4 minutes (on a good day) without getting firetruck red and needing to stop to catch my breath. 

Thanks for any help!

Smoking and feeling sad/depressed

It is really a weird feeling. I am almost at week 3 and going strong. The only hard part of quitting is that i actually feel sad at times. Like I lost something very close to me that i can't replace. 

Also pretty hecktic at my new work , going out of my mind sometimes not to smoke at instances . Even though I really thought i had this thing beat. 

Any ideas or support?

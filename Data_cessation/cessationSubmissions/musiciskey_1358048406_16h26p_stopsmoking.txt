I am in need of some advice!

So I want to quit smoking. Quitting cold turkey is too tough. Ive already decreased my smoking from a pack a day to a half pack a day. I need some advice/insight. Which is a better option to go to next? I want to ween myself. Should I go with American Spirits to get rid of the chemicals I inhale, or do the electronic cigarette? My birthday comes up in 9 days, and dammit, I want to keep going in a positive direction! Thanks in advance for any advice!

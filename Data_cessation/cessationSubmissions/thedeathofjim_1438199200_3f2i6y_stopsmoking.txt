Day Uno

Small Introduction: 21 year old Chinese kid who's been smoking for 5 years. This is my 5th or 6th attempt with the help of councilors on campus this time.

It's almost been 24 hours since my last smoke. I'm feeling twitchy and had a very bad 30 minute long episode/craving, but all in all things haven't gotten that bad yet. Not yet at the day 3 I-want-to-glass-everyone phase.

To Everyone in the early stages of quitting, THE CRAVING DOES GO AWAY IN THE END. Stay strong everyone!

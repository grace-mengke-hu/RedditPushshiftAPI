Mummy stop cigaretting 🤪

That's what my son started telling me.. Been trying to quit for ages. I am using vape as I could not go cold turkey but I will go off it at some point.. Its been 12 days now. Felt so dizzy the first week and every time I got crossed or stressed all i wanted to do was light up one.. I hope I can make it this time for a long run 🙏

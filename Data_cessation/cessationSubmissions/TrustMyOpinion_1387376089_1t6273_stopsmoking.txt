On Chantix, really helping with the cravings but sleeping/symptoms are weird..

So I've only smoked one pack in TWO and a half DAYS. I've been a pack a day smoker since I was 19. I'm 22 now. This is day 5 of Chantix. It is SO helping with the cravings, but the symptoms are weird. When I sleep, it doesn't really feel like sleep. I'm exhausted to wake up in the mornings. It takes a LOT. Plus, the dreams/nightmares are ridiculous. I woke up in a panic last night thinking this one dream was REAL. I literally had to convince myself that I was safe and in my bed, but this took about five minutes.

Anyway. I'm hoping by day 7 I'll put them down totally.

Similar experiences? :)

Living in a country that doesn't allow smoking in any "work space " sure helps those that want to quit. Canada.

Here in Canada, we have a national "no smoking " law that prohibits smoking ( of anything ) in any place where people are being paid to work. So, no smoking in any store, supermarket, bar, club, taxi, train, school, office, factory, or the like.

No one can smoke in a car, if there are children aged 16 or under in it. Playgrounds, swimming pools, and indoor arenas, are all no smoking places.

Many  rental apartment owners prohibit smoking in their buildings. No smoking in jails or prisons. No smoking in any hotel, or motel, not just in the rooms, but any where in the building.

Tobacco products are VERY heavily taxed, and stores that still sell them pay  huge amounts of tax to be able to sell them. Here in Ontario a package of 20 smokes costs about $9, and a carton of 200  costs about $70. Store owners that sell to those under 19, can be prosecuted, and of found guilty, the MINIMUM fine is Four Thousand Dollars, and the store is closed for 30 days, as punishment. 

Cigarette packages in Canada are VERY graphic with colour photos of rotting lungs, cancerous tongues and people who are in the last stages of dying from cancer. 


As a result the number of people in Canada who still smoke is about 15 percent of the total adult population of our country. That shows that it's working, as 20 years ago that number was 22 percent. 

It works here.

Would it work in your country ?

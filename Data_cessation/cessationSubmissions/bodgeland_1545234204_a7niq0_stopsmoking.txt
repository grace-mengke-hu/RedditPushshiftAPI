Onto Day 4. Does it get harder?

In about 20 minutes I will be through the first 72 hours and while I have to say the first 24 were not fun, it really has not been that bad. My question is, does it get harder? I still think about having a smoke every now and then but can easily dismiss the thought by saying to myself "I get to just stay inside where its warm instead of being forced to go outside and freeze". 

Hopefully this isnt going to be as bad as I anticipated.

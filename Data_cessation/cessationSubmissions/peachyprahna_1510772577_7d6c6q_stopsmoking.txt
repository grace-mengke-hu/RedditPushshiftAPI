Nonsense.

Long time lurker here. Long time quitter even....lapsed into full time smoking after thinking social smoking ‘didn’t count’. So that’s been half a pack for the last half year....many false starts, none of which were fully committed to and inevitably flopped.

Something feels different today. It has just clicked. It’s sunken in that all of these excuses we feed ourselves are fallacies - stories cleverly adapted by the brain to sustain an addiction, a slavery. It just doesn’t make ANY sense to keep living in this haze, nada. 

So here’s to a renewed life. 
I have a 10 hour shift ahead of me tomorrow, and I would love all of your encouragement! :)

Over it, done, free, and trying something new

Just put out my final cigarette.  I've never attempted to stop mid-day before; it previously sounded like something that would be better to do tomorrow.  The last one I smoked seem more like a chore... so I broke the remaining two in my pack and chucked them in the bin.  That act in itself was empowering.  Not tomorrow, not after I finish the pack, NOW.  I'm over it.  I don't need them anymore.  Next post will not be another "Day 1" for me.  Here's to life, from here for life.

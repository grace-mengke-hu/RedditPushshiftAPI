How to help partner quit

Hi, my partner smokes. This is very stressful for me because we can't afford any luxuries at the moment and it is already difficult to make ends meet. We are already using our savings to live on.

When he quits for even two days he is unbearable and aggressive. He starts arguments so that he can blame me for stressing him out and then goes and buys cigarettes and blames me.

I'm very stressed between being blamed for his smoking, afraid to say anything because he will just explode and use it as an excuse to buy more cigarettes.

At this stage I will have to leave him if he doesn't stop smoking but I'm afraid to tell him that because it will make him smoke more. I fantasize about packing my bags while he's away.

He didn't smoke when we met ten years ago and he was a completely different person until he started smoking two years ago. He was calm and coped well with problems in life. Now he loses his temper and needs to self soothe with cigarettes over even minor stresses. I find it very unattractive and consider it weak and beneath the standards I expect from a man. I need someone strong and dependable. Smoking was definitely the cause of the change - especially the regular withdrawal and then starting again when he can. I want my husband back!

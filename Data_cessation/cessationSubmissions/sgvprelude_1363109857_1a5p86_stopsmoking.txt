Having a hard time making the final push.

I been smoking since I was 15 (now 32), Wasn't much of a heavy smoker (about 1 pack every 2-3 days). Sometimes I can go 2-3 days without smoking, or days were I just have 1 or 2. I'm having a difficult time making that final push to really quit. Any advice for light weight smokers such as myself?

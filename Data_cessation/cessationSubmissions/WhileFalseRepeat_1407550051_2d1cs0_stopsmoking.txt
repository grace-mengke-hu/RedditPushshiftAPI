We are more attractive without cigarettes.

While smoking my teeth were very stained (even with regular dental cleanings). It is amazing how much whiter my teeth have become since quitting. I've actually had people comment on this. Also, I don't stink anymore! When smoking I never truly noticed my smell or the smell of other smokers, but now when I am around a smoker I am immediately aware of that awful smell. This reminds me that the vast majority of others are also very aware of this smell (and were aware of ***my*** smell as a smoker). Another nice thing is that my fingers are no longer yellowed and my skin appears much more healthy. I no longer am coughing or wheezing either. As a smoker, I probably made a very poor first impression to others. I'm quite sure I've lost potential love interests, business contacts, job offerings, and potential friends simply as a result of being a smoker. We really are much more attractive to others without this terrible habit.

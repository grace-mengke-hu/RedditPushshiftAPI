Starting over.

So I did good, and then got really sick with a throat virus in (all of) July.  Which made work come down on me hard for calling out, and they didn't much like it when I lost my voice for a week, and have moved me one step away from being fired. Fucking call centers.  Anyway-- the stress broke me and I needed something.   I tried distracting myself like it had been working for the previous weeks, even tried a shot of nice vodka for the shock and thrill after work, but nothing.  So I broke.  :(  Had a cig.  Chastised myself, washed my hands three times, and went to bed.

The next day the ativan for the 2nd week panic attacks didn't kill the urge when it came back... that was two weeks ago.  Quitting cold turkey without wellbutrin in my system isn't working, and I'm back up to my half a pack a day habit already.  The only thing I haven't gone back to is smoking at work, but I'm twitchy on the drive home.

I see my PCP tomorrow to beg for help and discuss options that will not send my serotonin into dangerous levels because of my other meds. Fingers crossed.

Edit: tried to remove my badge, didn't seem to work.  Will address that after seeing the doc.

Feeling alone and smoke-free day five.

Today has been miserable, made a few revelations and feeling emotionally drained. I’ve made it through five days smoke-free so far. 

I’ve recognised through keeping a diary that I mainly smoked throughout the night (I have a sleeping disorder and agoraphobia) and it became this thing that I did to help me with loneliness, I realise because of not leaving the house and also not sleeping properly I get minimal social interaction, I don’t sleep like everyone else does (at the correct time) and I don’t eat properly (or I heavily binge and my diet is horrendous). 

I never realised through my addiction how terribly I’d collapsed beneath it and I feel like I’ve literally woken up... I can’t process how much of me depended on smoking and clung to it. It’s also heart breaking knowing how many people close to me that are like this, and also people in general. It’s terrifying. 

I just joined here and I wanted to post to kinda push some stuff out. I genuinely hope I’ll be able to rattle through the next few days, weeks, months, years and so on. 

If anybody could write I would greatly appreciate any advice, tips and so on. I don’t know any non-smokers. Thank you for reading.

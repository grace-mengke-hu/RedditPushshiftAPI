Do cigars count

So my best friend just had a kid and her husband gave me a cigar as traditional.  I'm coming up on 5 months and I feel that if I smoke it with him I won't fall off the wagon. I've put to much work into not smoking.   Guess my question is if I smoke the cigar with him will i be resetting my clock because it means a lot to me that I've made it this far and I don't want to start all over again it would be soul crushing.  I don't feel like I ever need a cigarette again because for some reason this is really messing with with my head. I'm not sure how I feel about this.  Can't figure out what the do.  I'm lost any input would be appreciated.

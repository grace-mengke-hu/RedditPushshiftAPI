First day in

For about a week now, I haven't had my own ciagrettes. I've only bummed cigarettes off people whenever I've could, to cut down before; this weekend

It's saturday.
I haven't smoked since yesterday afternoon. I'm desperately craving for and thinking about how wonderful it would be to have a cigrarette.

But I'm doing it, only this day left and two more and I'm over the worst part.

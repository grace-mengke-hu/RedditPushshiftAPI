Well..poverty is making me quit.

It has been well known throughout my friends I can go 3 days without eating as long as I have smokes. It sucks ass but it can, and has been done many, many times throughout 2017/2018 and into 2019. But I haven't ate in almost a week now, also no cigs in 2 days. I'm sure some of y'all know how shit I'm feeling right now. Any advice on how to get through the withdrawals?

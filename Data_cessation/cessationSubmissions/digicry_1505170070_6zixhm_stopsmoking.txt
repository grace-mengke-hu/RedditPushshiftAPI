Almost 2 months and relapsed. Really committed this time

I will update this thread after a full year of not smoking a single cigarette. It was going good once I quit but just after 2 months, I took a puff off a friend's cig who was smoking alongside me. I REGRETTED that so much. Guys, it's not worth it. Soon after that puff, I lighted another one because I was like I broke it; why not light another one. Never do that. It's really not worth it.
I will update this thread or make a new one once I reach a year without smoking. Let's do it!

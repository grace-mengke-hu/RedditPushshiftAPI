Day 37 ... or isnt it ? (Advice pls)

So , day 37 in ... started with the 2mg nicotine gum. Was having maybe 7 a day  , then 5 , then 3 or 4 , and could not take less or i would go "crazy". 

Went out to dinner with lots of wine and stuff.. I was going crazy with all the smoke around me , and the alchool sure wasn´t helping. 

Near the place , there was a open store that sells those vaping things, and  thought to myself , well , better that than buy a pack . 

So i have been having this for the last 4 days, it´s kind of ok but i think it´s cheating, and i plan to go back to gum as soon as i finish this . 

But the gum was not working as i expected as i was getting addicted to the gum and craving gum  . 

So i know the best is just to quit gum or vaping thing. 

But if i cant .The vaping is 6mg nicotine . Do you guys think i should stick with this for a month or so and go down to less nicotine , and then try to stop or get rid of it now and go back to the gum  ? 

I still havent touched a cigarrete in this 37 days , and i dont want to , i dont intend to , but life is really bad now , and i get an "escape" with the vape or gum´s ... 

Any sugestions/help ? 

:/ Althou i havent smoked cigarretes i feel dispointed with myself , and putting that together with the stress i am under is becoming impossible ...

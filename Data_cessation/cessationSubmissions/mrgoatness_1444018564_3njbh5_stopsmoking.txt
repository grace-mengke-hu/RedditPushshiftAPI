Quit smoking on 10/4

I made it a whole day without a cigarette! I won't lie this is my third or fourth time quitting. The most I've ever held out is a year an a half, with the patch on for about a week. I got a 90-day patch kit from my old job that had been sitting around collecting dust. Former 1-2 pack/day smoker hoping it's the last time I quit. Any and all pointers are welcome to help me finally kick the habit!

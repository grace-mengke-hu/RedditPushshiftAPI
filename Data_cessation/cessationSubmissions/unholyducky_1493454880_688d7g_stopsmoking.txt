Day 1.

After having coughed up copious amounts of plhegm in the past week or so, waking up and needing to spit into a piece of tissue just to breath right and seeing just how much worse this path can take me, I've decided to quit with the aid of a vape. Working my way down from 6mg - 3 - 0 as I'm sure i wont be able to handle the cold turkey emotional response. But heres hoping.

(yes the guilt of still needing nicotine is there but its better than all of the nasty stuff in those long rods of death)

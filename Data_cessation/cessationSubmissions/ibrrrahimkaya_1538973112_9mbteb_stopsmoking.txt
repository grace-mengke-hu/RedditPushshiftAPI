The Stop Smoking App

Hi,

I am trying to quit again. Today is the 26th day without fucking nicotin. 

Anyway... Recently I have realized that the app always continuously reminds me cigarette through missions or badges and this is stressful. I turned the reminders off! But even so I look at the app at least 5 times maybe more in a day. Do not you think that this is a kind of addiction? Did anyone of you experince this situation? What do you think?

Have good day without nicotine.

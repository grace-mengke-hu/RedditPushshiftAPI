10 Days So Far And Feeling.....Angry.

Hey Reddit. It’s been 10 days of cold turkey and physically I feel amazing, especially at the gym. I’m not winded or anything. Side effects have been fairly mild as well except one thing. ANGER!!! The smallest, stupidest things are making me annoyed and beyond angry. I’m scared that this won’t go away for a while or even ever. I’m just curious on what to expect and how long will it take for the anger to subside? I don’t want to hurt my family, friends, or any loved ones at all. No one knows that I quit cigarettes since this is my 6th or 7th time quitting. I don’t really want to tell anyone since I’ve failed so many times that it’ll just be an embarrassment if I fail again. I’m truly doing this for my health but if I’m going to stay irritated and angry, maybe I might get back on smoking for good. I’d much rather hurt myself than anyone else. Any thoughts, suggestions, tips, or criticism is welcome. I had to use a throw away since some people I am close with know my account.

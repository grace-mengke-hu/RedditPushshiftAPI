Would you restart?

Looking for personal opinions, I’ve gone nine days without smoking a whole smoke. The other day I was getting emotional cause my dads anniversary is coming up since he’s been gone. I had half of one, my app asked if I wanted to restart or no. I hit no cause it still changes everything else on it. Would you have hit restart?

Oops..

I quit october 15th after four years. Ive generally been very confident about it, but had one...okay two..last week, ya know, just to prove to myself i was finished. I know, i know, thats never the way to go. The first one was great, fulfilling, enjoyable. "Oh no" i thought..this was a bad decision. So a couple days later i had another and oh god i remembered why i quit. The throat burned. The tummy hurt. The guilt sucked. So, how the story ends..im turning 18 in two weeks and a pack of cigs still isnt the first thing im going to buy myself. *high five*

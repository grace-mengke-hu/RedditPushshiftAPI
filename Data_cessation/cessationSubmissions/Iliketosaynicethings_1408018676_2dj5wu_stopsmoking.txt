Thank you, uniquestring's daughter.

I just want to thank uniquestring's daughter for [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2aep3u/uniquestring_has_died/) My mum has been a smoker for a good chunk of her life, and when I sent her this post and told her how I felt, she put them down and has been smoke-free for over a month. I am so sorry for your loss, but I'm so thankful you shared your story. Thank you.

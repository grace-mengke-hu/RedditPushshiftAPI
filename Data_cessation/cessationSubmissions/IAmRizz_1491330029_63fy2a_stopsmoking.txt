Giving it a second shot.

So like the title says I am quitting smoking again. The first time I quit smoking was for six months within that time I was making great improvements in my life. One thing I am doing differently this time is quitting alcohol for the first three months also. The first time I quit I substituted smoking with drinking and started drinking whenever a craving hit. This was a bad idea, because I started drinking heavily almost every night cause I always had cravings to smoke. Like I said it didnt last long and it was arpund after six months till I fell back into the subtle nicotine trap and been smoking a pack a day for about 3 months now. Today marks 2 weeks of my second time quitting without any patches or anything and also giving up alcohol for three months maybe more along with it. It was a rough first week but now the cravings are not as bad. I am posting this as a public reminder to myself because I feel more obligated when I feel I let others down. Instead of having the mind set of "Oh if I smoke I am the only one who will know, not like others know I failed." So any support is appreciated but also like I said just doing this for some extra reasoning not to smoke.

Stay strong people this addiction is only as strong as we believe it to be.

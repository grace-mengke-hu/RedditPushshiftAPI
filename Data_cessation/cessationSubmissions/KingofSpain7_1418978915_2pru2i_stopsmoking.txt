Quitting Tomorrow

Hey guys, tomorrow is the big day that I quit, again. I've been smoking for 6 years and as you can imagine, I have tried quitting plenty of times during this addiction period. My problem is, no matter how long I quit for, at the back of my mind I'm still craving that cigarette to some degree and if anything in life happens that sends me over the edge, I just cave in. I do not want this to happen. I have already read Allen Carr Easy Way to Quit Smoking, though this was powerful I'm afraid I'm of the small percentage that it did not fully work for. I'm going to be trying to read it through again but I was wondering whether you guys can enlighten me with any other tips and tricks to help me quit for good? 
Anything bits of advice would be greatly appreciated. I do not want this to be simply another failed attempt, I want this to be the next chapter of my life as a non smoker. 

Thanks in advance fellow redditors!

Need general advice about quitting.

I'm 28 about to be 29 in a few weeks and have been smoking since I was 15. I'm smoking close to 2 packs a day and just received patches. 

I have a few questions, some may be dumb. 

* should I start tomorrow on June 1st which is right before the weekend when me and m'lady drink or wait until the beginning of the week?  

+ I'm anxious about patches, is it just nerves and I'm crazy or should I be worried?(21mg patches) 

* the literature that was given kept referring to the 5 Ds. I don't have any talents/hobbies other than playing video games. What should I do to pass the urges, stress and boredom. 

* I really wanna quit, help.

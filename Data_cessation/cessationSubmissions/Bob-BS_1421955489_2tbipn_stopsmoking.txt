I caved less than hour after waking up. I could use some advice.

I read EASYWAY last night and I smoked my last cigarette and I went to bed happy knowing I was a non smoker.

When I woke up this morning I said "Yippee, I am a non smoker." I had the little monster and the big monster in my brain telling me to smoke. 

I told myself that it was just the addiction and the brainwashing. But then somehow rationalized that I am not ready to be a non smoker and lit up.

I fed the beast and continued the cycle. I am a rational person and it feels like 49% of me is ready to escape, but 51% is still a filthy slave to the tobacco.

I haven't went more than a day without tobacco in 10 years. It is clear that that first craving to smoke in the morning is a trigger that I have yet to overcome. 

Maybe having my last cigarette before bed is the wrong approach. Any advice?

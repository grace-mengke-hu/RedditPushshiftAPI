One year smoke-free!

I am incredibly happy to be able to say that I haven't had a cigarette in over a year now---haven't even taken a puff off of one. Quitting smoking has been one of the best decisions I have ever made and, at this point, I can't even understand why I chose to pick up the habit in the first place.

To anyone out there thinking of quitting, you can do it! The first little while may be difficult, but remind yourself of why you are kicking the habit. It is entirely worth it. : )

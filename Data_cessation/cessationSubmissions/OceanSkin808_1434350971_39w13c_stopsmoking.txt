All I can think about is smoking.

The following is a rant that may or may not make very much sense. :(  So I quit for about 2 months successfully using patches. Then my boyfriend started a new job and we had extra fun money which I spent on drinks which of course led to cigarettes. Right now we just paid rent and literally
Cannot afford the $8 for cigarettes. I've found myself without any nicotine and so angry and irritated that I can't smoke. I know I have the capability to quit since I did it already but I think the fact that I didn't choose to quit, I just can't afford it is making this so much worse. Should I just role with this and cold turkey quit? I actually looked outside and in all my ash trays for any butts with anything left in them but couldn't find Any. Seriously infuriated right now and wanted to vent.

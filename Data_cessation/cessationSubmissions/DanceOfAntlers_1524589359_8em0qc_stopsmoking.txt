Ashamed and disgusted by my habit of smoking cigarettes.

I've been smoking for the past 11 years and the last 5 I've been smoking a pack a day. The mental gymnastics I've had to play on myself to make it seem like smoking these things is normal and somehow beneficial is ridiculous. I would wake up in the morning and have trouble breathing only to smoke a cigarette 15 minutes later. The stench of cigarettes is awful and it's like I've been wearing it like cologne. I'm constantly coughing up stuff and I can barely smell or taste things. My fingers and fingernails are stained by the smoke. The inside of my car was coated with ashes and empty packs of cigs were all over the place. I'm 26 years old but feel like I'm 60. If I had to run I could only do it for 30 seconds and it would be a struggle to catch my breath. All these consequences for what? To feel a little bit relaxed as I feed my addiction? To seem more "social"? To calm down my anxiety? I just can't do it anymore. I'm disgusted by how I've treated my body for the past 11 years. When I first started smoking I thought the consequences happened to other people not to me. I naively assumed I'd feel like a healthy 16 year old dude forever. I told myself and others that if I felt awful I'd just quit but I've felt like shit for the past 4 years and yet I still smoked. I'm done with them though. If I keep smoking I know it will end up killing me. I've quit before for about six months so I know what is in store for the next few weeks. Each craving and pull to smoke again will be a reminder on why I want to quit. I just can't keep going on like this and I don't have any desire to continue this awful way of living.

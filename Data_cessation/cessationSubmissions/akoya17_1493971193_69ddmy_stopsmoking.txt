Unexpected benefit of quitting

I'm nearly two weeks down and I've noticed I no longer get dizzy when I stand up. Before quitting, if I wanted to stand up after lying down I'd have to rise to a seated position and stay there for 10 seconds or so before slowly standing, otherwise the room would spin and everything would go black for a few seconds - I'd have to hold onto something until it cleared. I realised this doesn't happen anymore! I never even considered that was related to smoking. I'm so damn glad to be free of the horrible stinky things!

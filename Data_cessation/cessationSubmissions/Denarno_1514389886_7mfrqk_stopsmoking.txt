Smoking, the social cause

Hello reddit,
I quit smoking 5 days ago because of a strep throat, before that I smoked for 2 years. It isn't really that hard for me to quit but the only problem that i encouter is the social fact. 
I always meet new people and even make new friends by smoking together. When I'm somewhere in a busy place, I have an excuse to go outside or to isolate myself for a while. Smoking for me is a social escape and a social tool at the same time. 
Are there other people encoutering the same problems and how you deal with it?
Thanks.

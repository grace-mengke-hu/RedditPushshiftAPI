This is by far, the hardest fight of my life.

I'm coming up on my 5th day of being completely and absolutely 100% smoke-free.  The cravings are absolutely unbearable but yet I am still hanging in.  Before quitting, I said to myself "I will never smoke again, I just want to be free."

Countless cravings are non-stop.  I have been browsing this sub vigorously, using the tips, watching videos and looking for all of the support that I possibly can get my brain on. 

At the end of the day, the cravings are still strong and getting even stronger.  This has really become the hardest fight of my life, both physically and mentally.

The chest pain was crazy tough at first and is now starting to slowly get better and more tolerable by the day.  When I woke up this morning my throat was swelled almost completely shut. 

I feel my body healing by the hour.  It's very hard to explain, but that is the only way I can put it in words myself.

The only thing that I can say after all of this..  Is that I'm extremely jealous of each and every one of you who have never tried a single cigarette and/or never got addicted to tobacco products.

FUCK YOU NICOTINE! I WILL WIN THE WAR!

Parking cut nicotine patches in my gums

So I started to smoke a few years ago but quickly (3 months in)began to realise the detriment to my health. However I was already hooked. I tried to use gum and mouth sprays which worked and I've stopped smoking since then. 

However it curbed my appetite too much and I would not go hungry sometimes for the whole day if I kept chewing gum or spray. 

I've recently found a creative way to get my nicotine fix which was to cut up the patches and park then in my mouth like the gums. Maybe because it has no flavour(but still the burning sensation which I really enjoy), my appetite came back. 

However I wonder if using the patch like I am is really bad for my body as it's not the intended method of use. 

Ive realise that I don't even like smoking but rather the addiction is the nicotine itself. I want to get rid of this habit for good as I think it's keeping me a bit underweight. 

Anyone got insight as to what health effects I may experience with my methods of use with the patches? Has anyone else tried this?

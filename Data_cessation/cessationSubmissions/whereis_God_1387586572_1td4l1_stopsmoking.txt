First post. Want to stop smoking but I have my last pack.

Should I finish it and quit or throw it away? I feel like finishing it. But then again i'm addicted :(

Edit: I see lot of people trying to quit smoking make posts here, maybe we can start together and help each other stay motivated? Maybe form a group?

**Edit2: Thanks for all the support guys. I have decided to kick the butt I gave away my pack to a friend and now i hope I can keep this up!**

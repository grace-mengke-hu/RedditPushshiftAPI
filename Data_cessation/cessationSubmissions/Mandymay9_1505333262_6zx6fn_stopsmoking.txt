How I have got to day 19 as a non smoker

A strong focus on finding the determination to stick to it. Single mindedly.
Doing other things. 
Being busy.
Feeling emotions but not getting trapped in them. 
Hope for the future. 
Love of myself and others. 
Watching the negative spirals.
Looking after myself when they happen and trying to put me and my goals high on the priority list. 
Not worrying about things I cannot change.
Remembering the reasons why I want and need to quit. 
Meditation on bad days.
Reddit. 
The smoke free app. 
Watching my progress.
Not wanting to fail. 
Not wanting to smoke. 
Not seriously considering failure as an option this time. 
Recognition that it's difficult.
Giving myself a break when it feels uncomfortable.

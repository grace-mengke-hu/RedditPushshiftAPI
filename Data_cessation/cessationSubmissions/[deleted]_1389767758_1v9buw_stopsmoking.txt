I'm doing it [photo included]

Oh the shame of repeated attempts... but I'm back here again and I haven't stopped stopping. 2 days in and I'm feeling pretty solid. Here's a disgusting picture, which shows cigarettes just in case you don't want to see them, of my (final) cigarette jar: [Imgur](http://imgur.com/C21W2vZ) - maybe if you're a smoker, the lid of this jar will give you some kind of wakeup call and you'll say, it's time to stop abusing my body and I don't deserve this. If you've stopped, then you can just laugh and feel the satisfaction of not having tar inside you. Thanks for being a supportive environment.

Just can't seem to quit.

Hey everyone, I have been smoking on and off for about a year and a half now. And by on and off, it's like 4 months on and a week or two off. I can't seem to get past that two week mark. I recently just moved to a different state and am living on my own for the first time ever with tons of bills, school, and a whole lot of responsibility. Any tips on how I can keep off of these things without falling back into it due to stress? Today will be my first day quitting in a few months.

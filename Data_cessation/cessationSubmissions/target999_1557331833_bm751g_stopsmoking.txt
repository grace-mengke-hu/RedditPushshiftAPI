Badly need help

Its been 2 months i haven't smoked after 8 years of Continuous smoking. But some how from past 2-3 days am getting bad cravings &amp; i dont wanna fall for it. There is second voice in my head who is trying me to convince me giving different way outs. That's all cause recently i have started working in same locality where i completed my highschool (most of smoking took place there ) . 

I would be glad if some one can guide and motivate me. 

Sorry for bad English.

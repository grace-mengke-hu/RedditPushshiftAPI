Quit 5 months ago, had a cigarette today and feel incredibly guilty.

The cravings started out of the blue about a week ago. I ended up giving in today after a really stressful day and almost scrubbed my skin off trying to get the smell off of me.  Someone please tell me I am not a failure! I feel like I've let my body down!

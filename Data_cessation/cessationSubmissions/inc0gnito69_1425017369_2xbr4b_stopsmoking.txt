My attempt to stop smoking.

After a couple of times trying to quit "cold turkey", I failed miserably. The biggest non-smoking period for me was two weeks, then I had a fight with one of my relatives and smoked everything I found next to me.
So now, I decided to make a different approach. Smoke 3 cigarettes every day. One on 6:00, one  on12:00 and one on 18:00. I hope to reach zero after a couple of weeks.
No cold turkey for me! Wish me luck!

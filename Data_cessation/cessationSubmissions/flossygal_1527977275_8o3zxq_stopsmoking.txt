What’s the best thing that has changed for you since you quit?

I have been smoking for 10 years. I am 24. For the past 7 months I have been using an [iqos](https://www.pmi.com/smoke-free-products/iqos-our-tobacco-heating-system). It’s heated tobacco. It’s not healthy but it does limit the effects of combustion (smoke, fire, tar, smell). I have been feeling better than when I used to smoke cigarettes. But it’s an expensive habit. I went from spending $150 a month on cigarettes to $400 on this alternative. And I’m still hooked on tobacco. But I can breathe better and my skin looks great. 

I should know better than anyone that I shouldn’t smoke. I am pretty active, work out 5 days a week. I eat well. I’m also a future doctor. So there’s always this guilt I live with. 

I have tried quitting several times in the past through numerous means. Cold turkey, gum, vape. The longest I’ve been was 1 year. 


I have read EASYWAY yesterday but don’t feel like it did anything for me. But I did do it in one sitting and maybe I need to take more time to digest it. 

I’ve been lurking for a while. Just wanted to share my story and look for some inspiration. Why are you glad you quit? What has gotten better? What was the push you needed?

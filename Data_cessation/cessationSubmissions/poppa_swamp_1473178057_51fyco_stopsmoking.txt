I got recked

I had been smoke free for a month which felt amazing, got wasted up north with one of my party buddies and ended up smoking like 5 packs in a weekend. Then I stopped again for a week, and went to a wedding this weekend and ended up smoking again!! 

I'm really sad because I wanted to be used to being smoke free before college started back up. Now I start school tomorrow and I'm sitting here hitting my vape. I feel dirty and my mind was so much clearer without nicotine. Not sure why I'm posting this - I know I want to quit again I just have high anxiety for classes starting up and don't want to deal with withdrawals on top of it now... 

Don't smoke it ain't worth it.

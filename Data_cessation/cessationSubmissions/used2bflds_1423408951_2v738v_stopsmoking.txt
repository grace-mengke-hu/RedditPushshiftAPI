THREE DAYS

I got a tooth pulled on Thursday and I haven't been able to sleep for 3 days. Pain pills don't help; it doesn't look like dry socket, but it won't stop hurting. 
I'm fighting. I won't smoke, even though it's setting off cravings every 30 minutes or so. I just... Ugh. This is as bad as day 1 all over again.

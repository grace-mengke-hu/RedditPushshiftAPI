I'll call it my first day

Been on and off for the past year. Can't really remember which day I smoked the last one. Yesterday was my birthday and today I get myself a badge and call it the first day. 

In the past year, I realized it's much easier to stop smoking with the support of family or SO. I have someone really cares about me, and that's the reason I tried to quit at the first place.

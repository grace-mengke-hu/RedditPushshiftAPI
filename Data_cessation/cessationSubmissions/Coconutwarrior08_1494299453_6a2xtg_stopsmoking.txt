A new story.

Today I decided i had enough. I have two options. Smoke or not smoke. The benefits on not smoking outweigh the short term high from not dealing with life or suppressing emotions. I made a decision to value my life, relationships and future as a non smoker. 

This happened in a moment, I was outside hiding away from my family stressing out about smoking; Constantly feeling like i have to hide myself from the world, all the things i want to, all the trivial dreams and thoughts we all have. As i was walking back my Aunty walked passed and i said "Enough with the shame!" I walked up to her and asked for help with a problem. 

The problem being smoking. The emotion was null in-void. I accepted i was a smoker all the emotional storm I'm in when i decide to employ the tobacco industry to kill me. In doing this i am responsible, accountable for my actions and accept the challenge to commit to a non smoker. With my actions and support I can do this. This will not be my story.

Sometimes a little help is what you need. If your time is being consumed by tobacco and nicotine accept its a problem. Do a little research and ask for some support. 

It's my first day and i will be kind to myself. Brothers and sisters. I believe in you! 

Peace.

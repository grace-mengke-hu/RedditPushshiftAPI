Nothing Happened.

I've been smoking for 10 years and I have lurked in here for ages. I figured I could read all of your good successes but I wouldn't ever have one of my own. 

I had to get my tonsils out the other day and that's facilitating me being on enough Vicodin to power an Appalachian town and also not smoking. I realize now that I was scared that if I stopped smoking, something bad would happen. I would lose out or miss something, or the cravings would overwhelm me. So I had to quit because of having surgery and I was dreading it. I thought this major chapter of my life was closing and I was bummed about it. 

I'm not trying to downplay peoples' real struggles here, because i'm sitting here with the benefit of a shitload of opiates and the knowledge that if I try to smoke I might burn my throat off. But I just wanted to share that.... *nothing bad happened*. Like at all. I still have all the same friends, the same home and family, the same desires and foibles. There were some cravings but they were so minor. Once you get over that first day hump, and you realize everything is going to be okay, it's so much easier. Just wanted to share.

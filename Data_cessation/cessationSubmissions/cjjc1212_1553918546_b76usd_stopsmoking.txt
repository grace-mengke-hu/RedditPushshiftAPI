3 years of using 45+ nic juice and i want to quit

Hello my name is chris i’m 18 and i’ve been vaping for about 3 years now this summer. it all started with the Juno vape in 10th grade that had 35 nicotine in it i owned about 3 of those and used the Juno itself for about a year then the Aspire Breeze came out and we would put 45 nicotine juice in those, i had a couple of those as well for about a year.  now i’m currently using the Rock Boulder pod system and i use 45 nicotine juice and i’ve been using it for about 8 months. i went to florida for a week last summer and didn’t bring any nicotine source at all and i was really grumpy for the week and really anxious about my girlfriend at that time was going to randomly break up with me, so the anxiety and mood swings during withdrawals is definitely accurate. my point is that i really want to quit because i don’t know what life long effects this will have on me. it’s so hard to quit because literally all my friends do it so i can’t really get away from it. i hit my boulder the first thing in the morning everyday and it’s my only buzz of the day. let me add in that i have been hitting dab pens and smoking weed for about 8 months now as well. i’d like to quit cold turkey on them both and i know it’ll be very hard but it’ll be worth it in the end. i wonder what benefits it would have for me in the end, would i be more social? would i look healthier and better looking? what i’m asking is for advice on how to quit and the best ways to do. thank you.

Need help breaking the habit

I’m a 22F university student who works part time. Being at university and having my own place, I find myself with a lot of free time and not a lot to do, this is where I find myself going out for a cigarette. It feels like it’s more of a thing to do out of habit when I’m bored, rather than a (majorly) addiction itself.

I’ve tried just not buying cigarettes but after a day or two I cave and end up buying some! Any suggestions of how to break the habit?
Thanks!

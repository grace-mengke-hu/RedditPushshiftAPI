Relapsed last night...

In my dreams! 

No, literally, I had a dream that I bummed a smoke off of someone, and it felt awful. Everyone kept asking me why I did it, and I was so ashamed. The good thing is that I was able to have that slip up without actually doing it, and it gave me that little push that I needed today: that smoking is only going to hurt me if I go back. 

6 days strong and feeling really good. 

Also, I wanted to recommend an app for iPhone called StopSmoking. It's really just a 30 minute audio track. It's called "hypnosis", but it's more like meditation with a mantra. The Scottish woman's voice is really soothing and I felt fantastic afterwards. I don't believe that it's really "hypnosis", but I do believe in the psychology of meditation. Using it has made me want to branch out and try other methods of meditation.

If you can take something like that seriously, give it a try!

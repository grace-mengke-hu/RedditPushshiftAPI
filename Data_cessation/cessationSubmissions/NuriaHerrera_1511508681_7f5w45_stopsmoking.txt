12 days no smoking

I am just using the app Smoke Free, i bought the pro version to get more commitment and it really helps. Also, i am doing lots of sports and healthy eating. I just don't remember to smoke yet, but the first week was horrible. I am sure this time is going to work and i will give up forever.

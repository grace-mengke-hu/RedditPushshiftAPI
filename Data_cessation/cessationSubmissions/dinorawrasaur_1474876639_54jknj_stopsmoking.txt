I have smoked for 5 years, I decided to quit tonight.

I smoked my last cigarette about an hour ago and I am determined to actually quit them this time. I have been reading through stories and that has offered me a lot of encouragment to stick with the decision.

I have been a moderately heavy smoker for five years and I always use excuses like my shitty job or stressful environments. Depression or Anxiety. Every time I talk about how I want to quit I always back off saying I'll quit when I have dealt with those other problems. None of that has changed but I have begun working towards changing that.

I have been through a rough month or two, I'll spare the details but life just has not been kind to me lately. I think quitting will be a sign that I am ready to move on to something better, and I really want it to be real this time.

I kinda made this post as some sort of concrete evidence that I want this and I want to never have another puff off a cigarette.

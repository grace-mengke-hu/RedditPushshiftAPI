It's hard to have the will to not be dependent on cigarettes when you're dependent on so many other things

I'm mentally ill and I take a shitload of meds which I depend on. However, I am not as stable as I can be. Working on that... with more meds.

I quit smoking (yes, quit, not stopped) twice in the past and while I initially felt good and empowered it never lasted longer than one week before I felt the therapeutical need for cigarettes. I honestly feel they provide therapeutical benefit to me, although I can't say I enjoy the coughing, wheezing, and phlegm. Oh well.

Hate it.

Hello
Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
I've been smoking for more than 10 years. I've made many attempts with different approaches. And as i'm writing this, none of them successful.
I'm looking forward to feeling truly healthy. 
As a reminder to myself, I hate all the following:
- the stink 
- not having control over my life
- the sore throat in the morning
- the physical decline
- the constant need and planning to smoke
- the smokers look

This is it.

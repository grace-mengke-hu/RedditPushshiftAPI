Help!

I've been lurking for awhile and I want to quit. My problem, I dont want to quit cold turkey and I don't want to do the whole medication and gum thing. 

Is there an app that will slowly cut smoke from my day to day. Like to slowly ween myself off. Like an alarm type.

I have android. Anything will help! Thanks!

Quitting Today

Hello!

This is my first day posting in this group.  After being smober eleven months, I slipped.  The mental relapse happened months before I picked up again, but I finally caved when my good friend was having problems after his heart surgery.  He is doing a lot better now, and I will be doing a lot better once I get back on track with my quit.  I am grateful I found this group.

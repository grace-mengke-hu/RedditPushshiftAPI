My friend's father has lung cancer

I couldn't sleep last night. The whole family has been very close to me most of my life, he had gifted me my dog (a Siberian Husky). He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer on the first week of this month. The doctors have given him two months to live. He has two daughters, one of them is studying abroad and I only wonder how they are going to fund the rest of her education. I've been close to them most of my life, he had no vices except his chain smoking. I feel terrible and I swear I will never touch a cigarette again. I had quit for a good two years (along with alcohol), and I had restarted frustrated with my inability to quit pornography, which was at that point, my only vice.

I pray that the family will have solace and I hope he won't suffer too much in the coming two months.

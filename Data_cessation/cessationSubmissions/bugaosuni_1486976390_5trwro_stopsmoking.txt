Two years

I'll be damned.  Feels longer.  I know I'll **never** turn back though.  I can't stand to be within a hundred feet of cigarette smoke, just like it was before I forced myself to inhale those noxious fumes for the first time.  For all you quitters out there, congratulations.  And to this community so many thanks.  It really helps to talk to other people.  So for those still struggling, come here regularly........ you will find inspiration and tactics and support and lots of other good things.  And my goodness, freeing yourself from nicotine addiction cannot be overstated.

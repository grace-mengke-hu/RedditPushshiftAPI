Going for it again, and this time it's done forever

So, my badge says some ridiculous number from when I tried to quit for the 5th time. I lasted 60 days at one point and I felt great. Now it's time to do it for real. Physically, I feel so shitty everyday, and I know smoking is responsible for most of it. Yet I chain them down anyway. Fuck this habit, it's going to kill me before too long. I just graduated with a biochem degree, and am going to be a young professional soon. I have a girl that loves me, and wants me to quit. I will be happier. My chest won't hurt. My lungs wont wheeze. I'm fucking 22 years old and feel like I'm 80. It's over. Here I go.

Edit: New badge now

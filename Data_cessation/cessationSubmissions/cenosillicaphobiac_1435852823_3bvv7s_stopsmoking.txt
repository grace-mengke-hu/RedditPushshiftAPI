Tough day today

Cravings are pretty strong, I'm sure it's because I quit taking Chantix and had a really tough time sleeping last night.  Finally got 2 hrs straight but prior to that was waking up every 30-60 minutes.

This time around I took Chantix for 1 week, and it didn't seem to help with the cravings really so I stopped it short.  It's now been two days, moderate to strong cravings both days, but fortunately they are much more of a "a wish I wasn't craving" than they are a "I am going to have a smoke" type feelings.

Sorry for the rant, sometimes it helps me work out the details.  Cheerio all!  Have a great smoke free day!

1 Year today!

I made it to one year as a non-smoker today! I slipped up just once a few months ago and had half a cig while I was drunk at a wedding, but otherwise I have remained 100% nicotine free for the last 365 days! I had smoked a half pack to a full pack every day for 8 years previously! I'm really proud and want to share hope here to anyone just starting their journey: it 100% gets easier, and you 100% can do it!

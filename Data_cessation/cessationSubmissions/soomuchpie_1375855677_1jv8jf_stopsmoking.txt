It's been a week... Doesn't feel like it.

Quit smoking after a financial issue, been disgusted on the daily with my 30 cigs a day habbit. After 6 years of smoking I am finally realizing it's not all fun and games anymore. This is not the first time i've attempted quitting. Using snus until my insurance comes through with patches. Just wanted to let everybody know i'm here, I don't have advice, not sure if I need any, but I'm with you all. This sucks, but life is more precious lived free! Good luck to you all.

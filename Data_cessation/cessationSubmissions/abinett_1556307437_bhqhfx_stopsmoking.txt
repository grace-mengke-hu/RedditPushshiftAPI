Day 28: Cravings

For some reason I am finding today very difficult. Craving won't go. The will to smoke is very strong. My brain is coming up with ways for me to get nicotine. Usually, since week 2, my cravings have been fleeting moments of "I mean it is physically possible for me to smoke. But I'm good". Where as today it's like... "your life would be so much fun with a cigarette. Otherwise it's going to be very boring". Which is a lie. My evening is going to be very boring whatever. I'm doing uni work. Smoking isn't going to make it any better. All it would do is drug me into thinking it was better.

Where as if I did the work I should be doing and finished it, I could go and have actual fun. So think I should be doing that actually.

Stay strong people.

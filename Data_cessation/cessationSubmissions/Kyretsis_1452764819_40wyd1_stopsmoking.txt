What it means to quit

I finally understand what it means to quit smoking. I finally understand what it means to be a recovering addict, because that's what I am. That's what everyone is who was addicted to nicotine. You're a recovering addict from day 1 until forever. 

It really sucks. It makes me just wish I had never ever begun (like most people) because if I had never begun I wouldn't have to deal with the thought of smoking, the thought of that instant gratification for the rest of this.

No doubt there is nothing good to come about smoking, but as a former addict you can only feel like there is something good there. Its all an illusion to trap you again. Stay strong everyone, I will too.

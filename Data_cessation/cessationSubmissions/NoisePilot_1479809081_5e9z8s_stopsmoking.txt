Finally Quit.

It's been a hell of a ride. I started smoking at 18, today I'm 23. 
I was at the point of smoking a pack every day and god forbid I didn't smoke for a day, because I couldn't.

After feeling like crap these months, I came here and was recommended Alen Carr's Easyway book.

Today I announce my 3rd day without smoking. I'm finally free.

Thank you all for your assistance and the book recommendation. I have some cravings, a horrible cough and big smile on my face. You probably saved my life.

To anyone looking for motivation to quit. Go for it, that book is really something else and it does make it easier.

Hi Friends, I'm coming up on my 10 year anniversary off the smokes. If I can be of any help to you, feel free to reach out

I quit smoking "cold turkey" in 2007.  At the time I smoked 1.5 packs a day. My smoker friends voted me least likely to quit (they still smoke).  I quit cold turkey, though I'll give some credit to the Allen Carr "easy way" book that got my head in the right place.  Quitting is one of the biggest accomplishments of my life. I thought I'd offer my support and words of encouragement to those of you fighting the good fight.

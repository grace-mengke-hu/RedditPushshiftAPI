Holy shit I made it to day 2 of no nicotine.

Hey yall got hooked on Juul last January, worst fucking decision of my life. It just worsened my life and all my other addictions and bad behaviors. I've l tried to quit on and off the juul but literally could not make it past a day. But when I did make it past a day I ended up smoking cigarettes. I'm at fucking 2 days and 17 hours right now and I'm hoping to the sweet lawd I can continue on.

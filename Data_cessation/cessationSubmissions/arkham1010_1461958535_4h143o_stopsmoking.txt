Anyone have fits out of the blue months after stopping?

I quit vaping January 1st, and I've had the normal issues. I dealt with it and got over it. First month sucked and thats to be expected, but it got easier and easier.

Its now going on the start of month 4 and the fits are back and strong the past few days. Whats going on with that? I'm being strong but what the hell....

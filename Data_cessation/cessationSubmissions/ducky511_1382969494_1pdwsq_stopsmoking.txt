Onto my third day

Can't count how many times I have tried to quit. Longest I have ever gone without smoking is 3 months. Have been smoking for 10 years and I have had enough. I love smoking but it has to end, for money and for health. Sad to say though its mainly for money. 

My goal for the week is to make it till next weekend without smoking. If I can design without caving, it will be a mile stone, which means no more drinking while designing.

My wife has been very supportive, even if she doesn't really understand.

So in short. 3 days. Any advice on staying strong and making this go at it my last.

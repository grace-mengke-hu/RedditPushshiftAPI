My 100th time trying to quit....this time feels real

I have been smoking for 24 years & I'm under 40...that's more than half my life with a cigarette! Any adult issue, celebration, depression I've handled has been with a cigarette. I've tried to quit so many times but this time feels different. 
I am doing reserach, put a quit smoking app on my phone, begged my friends to not smoke around me and I'm even joining little groups like this. I feel stronger this time. A determination I never felt before. I am ready to take back my life!!! 
I've been smoke free for 10 days and I even got my boyfriend to join me. Drinking/socializing and getting out of work are the hardest times for me but one day at a time. I don't want to be a quitter anymore I want to be a nonsmoker

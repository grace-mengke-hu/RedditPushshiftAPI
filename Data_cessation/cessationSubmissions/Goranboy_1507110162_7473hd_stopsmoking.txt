Why am I missing the early stages of quitting?

As my badge says I quit ~60 days ago. And as of lately I start missing the early days, the intense cravings, when I had inner dialogues with my addiction. When the quitting was so thought consuming, and I had to find distractions. Also the excess energy either gotten less, or I just got used to it. Quitting is just not as exciting anymore? I'm not really proud anymore of quitting. what is happening? any points of view?

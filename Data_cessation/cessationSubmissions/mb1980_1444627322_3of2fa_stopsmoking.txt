37 days quit. I expected more.

It's been 37 days since I had my last vape (about a month off of analogs before that).   I have handled most situations (aside from drinking, I'm scared to go there just yet).   My main trigger is when I need to concentrate, or otherwise exercise my brain, usually to do my job.  That's when I have to fight the anxiety the irritation, and then the psychological craving.  That's 8-10hrs / day, 5 days a week and it's exhausting.  I can get through any craving, I know that, so there's a win.  But, I cannot continue to spend my days just getting through these episodes.  When I have a craving, I read about not smoking here, I run through my list of why I quit, and I think of my family, my friends and my health.  Maybe I need a walk, and if so I take one.  I then try to go back to whatever I was trying to do, and it repeats.  This is how my days days go.  It's a wicked cycle that I spend my days trapped in, and I though it would be gone by now.   

Any advice to get back to normal?
How do I begin to forget about smoking, when I spend so much of my time being reminded of it, substituting for it and thinking about not doing it?
How do I start to move from an ex-smoker, to a non-smoker?

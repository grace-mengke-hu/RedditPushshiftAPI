quitting booze &amp; smokes at the same time

howdy, hopped over here from /r/stopdrinking. today is day 4 with no booze and I'm trying to quit smoking as well. some say quit one at a time, but does anyone else find that cigarettes and booze go hand in hand? in terms of quitting. the longest I've ever quit both was for two months this summer; I found if I can keep myself from smoking, i have 0 desire to drink. drinking is no fun without the smokes! doesn't hold for the same way around. and I find the more I chainsmoke from the anxiety of quitting booze, the more idle my brain becomes, the less energy I have, and thusly the more I start thinking a beer sure would be good with this cigarette...

I'm sure there some neuroscience behind this but it feels like cigarettes grease the same pleasure/addiction pathways as drinking, making it harder to quit. anyone who's quit both simultaneously, what did you find were the best tools that helped you in the acute moment of having a craving?

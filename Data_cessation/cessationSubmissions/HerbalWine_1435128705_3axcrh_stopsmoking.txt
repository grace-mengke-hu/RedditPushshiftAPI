Snack and weight management suggestions?

Not sure if I should've posted this to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy, but hnn I think this is more specific to the issue at hand..?

But yeah - so the normal advise is to drink lots of water and juice, and have fruits and grain as snacks. In your experience, how do you know what portion size to take and how often? I know being hungrier's part of the quitting process, but hngh I'd also like to avoid gaining more weight than I should

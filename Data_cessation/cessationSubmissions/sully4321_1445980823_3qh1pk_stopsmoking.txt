2 months after quitting - I am still addicted and I still crave.

2 months ago I quit my 10+ year, 1 pack a day habit. This has been my third real attempt at quitting. My last cigarette - at the time of lighting my last smoke I didn't know it was going to be last one (there had been no real thoughts about quitting either) but half way through I decided that it was going to be my last one. (I try not to procrastinate about things, where possible).

Even after the physical withdrawal symptoms of the first couple of weeks have passed,
What has really helped throughout this journey has been the positive re-inforcement and encouragement that I get from friends and family, and also through resources such as this subreddit (btw - thanks!!). Another source of motivation is to make the consequences of smoking something personal to me - I guess we all live vicariously through celebrities and famous people, and for me it is very interesting to see which famous people have had deaths that could be attributed to smoking related disease - i.e. three British kings died in the 20th century because of this thing! 

I am still addicted, and I think I will always be tempted to start again. For me this is a daily battle. I still have so many triggers that will trigger a memory of my smoking past, and the warm familiarity of having a cig in my hands and dragging the smoke through my lungs. I don't love smoking, I don't hate it. Moments of stress, sex and alcohol, and also certain physical locations - are all strong triggers. This past week has been really tough in terms of work related stress.

It has been 2 months since my last cigarette and I still crave. This morning I wake up to the feeling of craving. This thing is going to be a daily battle for the rest of my life, and I really do hope I can beat this thing on a daily basis.Good luck to everyone. You are all very motivating to me. Thanks for listening!

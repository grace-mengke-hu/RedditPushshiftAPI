I made it farther today than I have in 3 years.

Hey guys, I broke tonight.  I know that no excuse to smoke is a good one, but I work front desk in a hotel and tonight I had to kick a whole family out on the street (under managements orders).  I donno, usually I can handle the stress, but this one got to me and I smoked.  I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.  But tomorrow's a new day #1. 

On the brighter side, I lasted 14 days this time, and I haven't been able to quit for more than a few days before this.  This sub is single-handedly weening me off of this shit little by little, so thank you.

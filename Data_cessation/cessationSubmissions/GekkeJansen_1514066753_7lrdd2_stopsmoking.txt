Dealing with anger management

So I quit smoking 3 days ago, I’m somewhat ashamed to admit I do vape on and off but not even nearly as much as I smoked. 


Thing is, I’m reading Allen Carr’s book because I want to go cold turkey at some point but there is just one thing I struggle with, anger. If I get angry I just want to smoke a cigarette out of protest I guess. Vaping doesn’t work because it’s not really bad for you compared to smoking. 


I’m not an angry person in my day to day life and I’m not abusive by any means, but sometimes I just get ANGRY and at that point I love to smoke because of the self destruction I’m not really sure. 


So yeah, my question do you guys have the same problem and how do you deal with it?

About to begin day 6. It all seems pointless.

Seriously begin to refute every bit of motivation I've got. I keep trying to rationalize smoking just one more cigarette. I want it so bad. What do you do when you get to that point? When am I going to start to feel better? I feel like I can't stand this for much longer but I don't wanna be weak. I just want this to end. Urggghhhh

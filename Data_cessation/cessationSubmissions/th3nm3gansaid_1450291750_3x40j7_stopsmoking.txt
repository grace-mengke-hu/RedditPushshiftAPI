Day 5 Nicotine-free

So I am currently on Day 5 and I'm feeling great!  
Everyone always told me that quitting smoking was going to be the most terrible feeling in the world, but that hasn't been my experience thus far.  
I'm 21 years old, all of my friends smoke. Being young, none of them really see a problem with smoking and they all say the same thing: "I'll worry about that later, it's not a problem with me yet."
It's a little disappointing because although I'm young, it's very objectionable to me. I've wanted to quit for several months, but hadn't really mustered up the motivation. It was getting to the point where every time I smoked a cigarette, I felt extreme guilt and couldn't block out the thoughts of what I was doing to my body. None of my friends really understand this, which is why I am here with you awesome people!  
So 5 days ago, I had a really odd experience. I was at home, and went out to smoke a cigarette. As soon as I was done and went back inside, I got this overwhelming and undeniable feeling that I never, ever wanted to put that shit back into my body. I had always planned to quit using Nicotine Replacement Therapy, but something inside me said I didn't even want to do that. I wanted to rid myself of it all as soon as humanely possible. All of this motivation seemingly came out of nowhere, and I'm very grateful for it. I have had physical cravings but I haven't had any thoughts of truly wanting a cigarette.  
I just wanted to share what I have done, hopefully it can help someone out there.  
* I quit totally cold turkey. I believe this is easier in the long run.  
* I drank some cranberry juice and lots of water the first 3 days to flush the nicotine out ASAP.  
* The first day was the only day that was truly terrible. I felt anxious and couldn't stop grinding my teeth. I literally kept something in my mouth all day (straw, gum, etc) just to make it through.  
* Deep breathing helps a lot when I feel a craving. I'm not sure if it's just all in my mind, but it helps me.  
* A change in attitude. I'm not depriving myself of anything. I am gaining my life back.  
* Not thinking about quitting forever. I just don't want to smoke today.  
* Telling everyone I am quitting. That way, I have people to hold me accountable.  
* Don't sit in self-pity! I don't need to mourn smoking or mourn the "loss" of one of my vices, I'm going to go out and celebrate freedom from cigarettes!  
* The "Smoke-Free" app really helps. The upgraded version is worth the $4.99, it keeps me motivated and it is how I found this forum.  
* Don't get cocky. Although I feel awesome 5 days in, I know I'm not immune to ever smoking again.  
* Have a game plan for what I am going to do at times I would usually smoke. For example: After meals, I now chew gum. When I wake up, I drink green tea instead of coffee and a cigarette.  
* I look at this forum every day to remind myself I'm not the only one out there deciding to fight back against nicotine.  

If anyone has any other tips to add, it would be much appreciated!   
Hope this helps. Keep on rockin' in the free world, redditors.

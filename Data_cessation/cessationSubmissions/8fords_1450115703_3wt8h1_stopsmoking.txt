Quit Gift: Anniversary for Quitting Smoking

My dad smoked for 40+ years, and is now approaching his 1 year anniversary of quitting. It is really, really hard on him. He used smoking as a coping mechanism for his emotions and he's struggling: having anxiety, depression, fears, the whole shebang. So, he's been staying firm on the smoking in spite of the emotions, and we're all really proud of him (my siblings, and family and I). We want to give him a 1 year anniversary gift for quitting and sticking with it, and we want it to be relevant and in some way, help him with the difficult emotional aspect.  He hasn't yet found another "thing" to use to cope with his emotions and refuses to go to therapy.  While we intellectually understand that quitting smoking is difficult, none of us have ever been smokers, so we can't really understand what he is going through, even though we empathize.  So we'd like to ask if any current/former smokers have any suggestions?
We care for him deeply, want the gift to resonate with our appreciation that he quit (we want him around for awhile!) and that we recognize how hard it is/was to do. He loves woodworking and cars, but his garage is so filled with (our) junk he can't access his tools, so we've committed to cleaning it out for him to get him spurred on his old hobbies, but we feel that's something we should do regardless of his quitting smoking (its our mess after all).
Any ideas from former smokers to help out a guy (mid 50s, otherwise healthy) struggling with the absence of cigarettes?

23 years old, 6 days off of cigarettes, bad anxiety.

Hello there, recently I stopped smoking smoking cigarettes after 7 years of doing so (half a pack-up to a pack a day) and i'm doing pretty well on mentally quitting and avoiding my cigarette triggers. I recently bought a vape with 3 milligrams of nicotine in the vape juice and it's working well to subside my cravings.

My only problem though is I have mild anxiety and ever since I quit, when I go for a long time without hitting my vape (around 2 hours) or when I wake up from my sleep I have spurts of terrible anxiety and I was wondering from someone who has experience in quitting nicotine with anxiety how long it took for their nicotine withdrawal anxiety to stop.

Thanks in advance.

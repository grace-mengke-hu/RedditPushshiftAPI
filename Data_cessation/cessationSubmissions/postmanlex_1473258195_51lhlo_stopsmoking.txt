Day 3 down, stressing

Its been 72 hours since my last cig and im stressin. I bought a vape to switch to (nicotine free) and its been working, but cigs are always in the back of my mind and the only reason i havent relapsed is cause the vape was so expensive. What made it so hard to quit was the fact that i love smoking, and i only quit cause the people around me want me to. How do i stop myself from having a cig next opportunity? Im still craving them so bad and i cant stop

Badge Reset

I just rest my badge since I smoked a couple cigarettes 5 days ago after being nicotine free for about 23 days. They tasted terrible and I hated myself for smoking them. The last few days have been very depressing because I've been thinking about it nonstop. This place has really helped me and I couldn't even look at reddit the past few days because of the disappointment and embarrassment. But I'm back now and feeling much better. I just can't make that mistake again!  I'm posting this for my own personal accountability and to make sure I stay a non smoker. I have to make sure this was just a hiccup and not a total failure. The 3 weeks I had without smoking were the 3 best weeks I've had in a long time. I'm not giving up. Nice try though, cigarettes!  You little fucks almost got me!

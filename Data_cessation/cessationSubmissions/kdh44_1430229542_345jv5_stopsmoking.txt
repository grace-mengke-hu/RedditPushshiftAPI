I continue to slip--ugh!!

I will go a day or 2 without then break down & smoke 3 (bummed) right in a row. Then go another day or 2 and buy a pack--smoke them all at home in secret, then go another day or 2 without. I end up upset with myself for the sneakiness and even AS I SMOKE AGAIN I'M REGRETTING THE FEELING IN MY LUNGS, ETC. WHAT THE HELL WRONG WITH ME??

Day One is done. Fucking hallelujah.

Using nicotine patches for a week like I did last time.  Back at home after graduating college and this is the perfect time to quit. I picked up smoking as a teen (stupid, stupid teen!) and I associate it with being childish and trying to "look old" and shit.  I'm done with that. I'm older now, educated, on a great path, and looking forward to the things I'm going to accomplish in the future.

And quitting is just one of those things!

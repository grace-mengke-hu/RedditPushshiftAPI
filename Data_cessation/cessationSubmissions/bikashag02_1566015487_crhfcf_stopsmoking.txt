5 Years Since I stopped smoking.

I (M27) started to smoke when I entered high school. I used to smoke 6/7 cigarettes but 5 years back I got a minor health scare. I got shit scared and stopped cold turkey. It’s amazing what fear can make you do. 

I did have the craving for some time and used to ask my friends to smoke around me so that I could enjoy the smell, but now gradually all urges have died. I hangout in a group where everyone smokes except for me and I am proud of it. 

Have to replicate the same thing with alcohol too, as It’s starting to get a bit out of hand.

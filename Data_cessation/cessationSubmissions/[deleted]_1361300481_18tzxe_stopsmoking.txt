Trying again...

I've been having an extremely hard time quitting after my most successful attempt which was 38 days. Ever since then I've been having the hardest time even going 20 mins to an hour without not smoking. But today, is the first time in a few months that I've gone 16hrs now and feel pretty confident. I'm going to give this everything I have! I'm so tired of being a slave to the cigarettes.

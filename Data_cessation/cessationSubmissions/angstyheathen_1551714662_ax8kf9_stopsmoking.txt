I caved, but it’s just temporary

I caved after 55 days after a particularly stressful day at work. One of those “if I don’t step outside and smoke a cigarette right now I won’t be employed here any longer” type of days. It’s not an excuse and I know damn well that it’s never one puff, yet here I am smoking again.

Either or, I’m getting back on the wagon again. I reset my app and I have a date set. Typically I’ve quit cold turkey, spur of the moment. I’m hoping planning the day and likely using NRT will help it stick this time around. 

Not really asking anything, just a long time lurker getting some shit off their chest. Thanks for the read, and good luck to everyone still holding strong!

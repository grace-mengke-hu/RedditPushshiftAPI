I want to quit smoking cigarettes, but I still want to smoke weed

Seeking advice from people that quit smoking cigarettes, but continued smoking weed. 

I've had enough. Im tired of the cravings.. the excessive mucus.. the costs.. the smell.. all of it.
People will probably tell me to browse previous reddit posts, but I thought I'd make my own one and begin my own journey.

Some questions I have:

Does vaping help to quit?
Shall I stop mixing weed with tobacco?
Nicorette? Is it worth it?
How to get through the cravings?(theyre especially bad when on a night out drinking and we all know that many stupid decisions are made when youre drunk)
When does it get easier?

I've tried quitting multiple times, but never made it past a few weeks. It gets especially hard during exam season when I'm in the library all day stressed as hell trying to study and the only break I can catch is a cigarette break. 

Any advice is welcome!

EDIT: Thanks a lot everyone! Some great tips that I will surely use in the future. After I made this post I had my last cigarette and decided to fully quit. Thats it. I gave away my last pack to a friend and announced to my group of friends that Im done (ive never done this the previous times I tried to quit). I think one of the main reasons I failed to quit before was the fact that I would smoke spliffs (weed and tobacco) which means that I would always have cigarettes around tempting me and eventually I cave in. From now on, no more nicotine, im cutting that shit out. 
Wish me luck!
Day 1

The weekends are the hardest

I wouldn’t say I have quit because the past month I haven’t been smoking from Monday to Friday and then as soon as the weekend hits I fail and smoke a couple. 

The worst part is that they make me feel terrible but I don’t know what I can do to get through the weekend without smoking. Any tips? I’ve started writing down my thoughts on it all every evening and that helps a little but I just feel like a failure.

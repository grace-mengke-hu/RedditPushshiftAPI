Quitting for love...

My wife and I separated 6 months ago. I've been absolutely miserable without her. Long story short, I want to be back with her for good. She says I have to show her change. Well after 10 years of smoking, I'm quitting. Quitting because I love her, want her back, and I really want to quit anyways. This will be my reason to quit. Wish me luck!

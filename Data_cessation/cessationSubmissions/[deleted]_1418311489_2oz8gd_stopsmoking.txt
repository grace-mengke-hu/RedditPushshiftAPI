One month out with a few observations

I am right at a month out and I thought I would make a few observations. The decision to quit was easy. The psychological addiction has been surprisingly easy, so far. The physical symptoms of withdrawal have been harder. First, my legs were cramping at night, no matter how hydrated I was. Second, my blood pressure spiked around a week and a half out. I went to my doctor/friend and he said it is common, although I hadn't read about it anywhere. I decided to use exercise as a replacement. With that came a better diet in order to sustain the exercise. The result has been weight loss. No real revelations here, just wanted to share in case someone else is quitting and was experiencing something similar.

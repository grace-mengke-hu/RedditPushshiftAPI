Drinking & Smoking Like Red Beans & Rice

Quit smoking for 9 days now. Wednesday night I gave myself a test - drinking & smoking. My drink of choice is whiskey, and for me whiskey & cigs go hand after hand. My plan was to resist resist resist, hoping cravings would subdue. They didn't; they got stronger - the strongest I ever felt. I didn't smoke, I just ended my night early. I last one hour and twenty minutes before calling it a night. Plan: next time, try to last one hour and forty minutes.

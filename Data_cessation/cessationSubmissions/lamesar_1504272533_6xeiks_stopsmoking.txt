Quit smoking over a year ago and still have intense cravings from time to time.

I quit smoking last July using the patch. I have no real desire to start smoking again, but sometimes I get these intense physical cravings where I just really want a cigarette. Sometimes it happens right after sex or when I'm drinking because I used to smoke at those times, and other times (like now) it's totally random! Has anyone else experienced this, and is it normal?

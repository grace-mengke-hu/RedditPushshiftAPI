A rough day

I dunno what’s going on. This is day 14 and it’s been the worst so far. It’s not like I am craving a smoke but I’m just so full of anxiety. Everything seems to be pissing me off and I feel like nothing will make me happy. I am determined not to slip, that’s not really a concern, I just don’t wanna feel this edgy, it’s making me and my family miserable
Thanks for listening

pain in my chest

I've been (unsuccessfully) trying to quit smoking, trying vaping to help with cravings and stuff, but lately I've had this pain in my chest. It's close to and a little lower than my adams apple, hard to explain. I don't know if it's the smoking or the cold air or what, but I think i'm ready to quit. Do you guys think it's anything serious? other than the pain, there are no other symptoms

EDIT: it resolved itself in a few days thankfully, but the pain was so bad it was difficult to sleep. glad that's over

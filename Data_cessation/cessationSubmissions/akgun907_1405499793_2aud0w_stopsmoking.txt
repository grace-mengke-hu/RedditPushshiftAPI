Today I Start Anew

This is difficult to write, but I have a feeling that sharing it all will allow me to externalize the reasons I haven't given it up yet.  I started when I was fourteen in an effort to block out the thoughts of what was going on at home.  Over time smoking became a way of holding myself accountable for the innumerable failures that I assumed responsibility for whether they were my fault or not.  It became an outlet for me to pursue my own destruction in a socially acceptable fashion.  I have always had a self destructive mentality and it has taken me a great deal of personal work to overcome the mental deficiencies passed on to me from my parents.  The reality is, that by subjecting myself to those I thought were teaching me to be a better person, I have succumb to my inner demons more than ever.  Today starts a new chapter and after finishing the last cigarette at 0000 this morning, I am proud to say that I plan to never take another drag.  It is time for me to allow the past to be the past, and to focus on the future that lies ahead.  I need to get back in shape, both mentally and physically.  I need to start living in a fashion that isn't focused on myself or my perceptions, because I have a daughter who will need me to be at my best in all capacities and at all times.  The goal was never to stop smoking, but rather to start living.

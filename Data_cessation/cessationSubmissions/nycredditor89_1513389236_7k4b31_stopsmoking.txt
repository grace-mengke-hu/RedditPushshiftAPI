The Anxiety Though...

So I naturally have ridiculously white teeth, and I've been smoking for 5 years without any stains. As recently as July, someone made a comment on how white my teeth are.

And then, just this month, a stained yellow glaze appeared over my teeth. All at once.

I immediately made a commitment to quit then, but there's just so so so much anxiety produced by it. And then the fucking anxiety causes me to smoke again! I've drastically reduced my smoking overnight (went from 2-3 packs a day to 3-4 cigarettes a day instead), but it's seriously the anxiety that gets to me, and then gets me to smoke somehow too.

It's actually scary how fucking powerful the addiction is. The entire day I will firmly believe that I've permanently quit, I will have absolutely no craving, nothing, and then I see a cigarette and just how fucking fast my mind tunnels towards wanting the cigarette again would be fascinating if it weren't terrifying.

As you can tell, I'm anxious now (I think). I don't know. My point in making this post though was to maybe have some of my anxiety relieved. I think...

Ugh, fuck guys, will I be able to restore my teeth?? Every time I look in the mirror, I get such a painful wave of anxiety and then guilt and remorse for letting myself get to this point. I always said I'd quit before my teeth stained, and here I am...still smoking 3-4 a day, still convincing myself that it's OK as long as I don't do it so much, still treating my body like shit.

Please tell me the stains will go away soon...

So, let's see if this works

Good Morning, all! I found this sub from /r/stopdrinking. So far I've made it 26 days there. I'm hoping this might have the same effect! I had my last cigarette yesterday. I'm using a vape for the next few days to ebb the withdrawals-as I'm still early in my sobriety, and that comes first, I don't want to risk a relapse for both...so a safety net.

Any tips y'all have? So far I've only pulled a few drags off the vape...has anyone successfully quit using the vape to cut down?

Thanks!

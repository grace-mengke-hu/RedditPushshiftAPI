Anyone else?

This whole stopsmoking thing has gone from counting the hours and staying away from cigs to finding out what the f* has happend to me. During most of my smoking days i had a long distance relationship, we broke up and then i realised some day ago that im having a really hard time getting an erection. Did this heal over time? Can i do anything to help it? Can a doctor check me? Im freaking out, i used to love sex but now im just worried i will dissapoint someone.. including me. All withdrawal pangs, moods and stuff just flew out the window when i realised this, now im just deppressed and insecure.
Might this also be some sort of subconcious psychological withdrawal effect from quitting smoking? I mean im just not feeling that horny anymore..

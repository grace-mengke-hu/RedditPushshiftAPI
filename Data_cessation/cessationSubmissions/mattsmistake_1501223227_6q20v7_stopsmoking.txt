Can smoking affect libido/ erectile problems?

So I started seeing this girl a couple days ago. We were making out earlier and she went to grab my junk, but for the life of me, I couldn't get hard. I'm only 24 and I've never had this problem before. The only thing that's changed lifestyle-wise is my quitting smoking three days ago. I guess my question is if quitting can reduce libido or lead to some form of erectile dysfunction? If so, how long do things take to return to normal? I mean, I'm still staying the course and don't plan on smoking again, but I just want to know what to expect in this area.

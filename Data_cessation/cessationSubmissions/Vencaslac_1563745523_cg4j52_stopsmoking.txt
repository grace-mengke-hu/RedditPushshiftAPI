I did it dad

My dad died of smoking induced lung cancer just under 10 years ago, I smoked at his funeral. We used to light up together too but before I started smoking, in highschool, we used to swim together. 

I grew up close to the sea, and we used to go to the beach every day in the summer. He and I swam out to the buoyes and would just go back and forth between two particular ones, maybe 200m appart. It wasn't a sprint, more of a leisurely stroll, we'd chat, talk about school and math and stuff ( he taught highschool math, but wasn't my teacher ). Our record was 8 laps in one go without touching the ground with our feet, so maybe about a mile. Not that impressive but I was just a kid, and he'd already been smoking for 30 or so years.

Smoking immediately ruined what stamina I had so after highschool we did it less and less and eventually stopped altogether and then he died.

Today I've been quit 9 months and 9 days, and I got the chance go visit that same beach in that same spot, and I couldn't help myself. I swam out to the buoy and slowly started making my way... I stopped a couple of times, switched strokes... but I did it against the wind and current...

 It was pretty emotional because when he was in the hospital one of the last things he said to me during those last few days was that I should quit... He knew it was hard, he knew the costs and it was heart breaking lighting up just outside the hospital after that conversation... but now I can say... I did it dad... I finally quit.

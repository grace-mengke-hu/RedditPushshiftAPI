2 months and 3 days!

I stopped smoking last August as a part of my anniversary gift to my girlfriend. It's going pretty good at this moment! There were a few struggles tho.

* 3rd day: Less appreciation of coffee(My morning routine includes coffee and cigarette)
* 1st week: Few withdrawals
* 2nd week: More and more withdrawals
* 1st month: Urges to smoke after eating(as it was my routine back then)
* 4.5th week: Severe urges

But now, I can say that there is a minimal to none urge to smoke! I really can't believe I did it. :)

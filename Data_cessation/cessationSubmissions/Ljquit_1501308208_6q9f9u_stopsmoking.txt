5 months (and 2 days, but who's counting, lol)!

Before I quit and when I first quit, I never thought I would be able to get this far. And yet here I am. Annoyingly, still craving sometimes too, especially when stressed. But then I'll smell someone else smoking, or worse, when they've just finished and smell like an ashtray, and I remember I don't want to smell like that. Or I'll see someone up the street, especially other women my age, and I think it looks really awful and I don't want to look like that. But I do miss it. That 'something to do' when stressed or bored. But I like being a non-smoker better. I still come to this sub sometimes, especially when I'm craving, and look for posts from people that are further along than me to see whether they still crave them. I can go for days without craving until some stress or other happens, but even then, the craving is more like a thought and it's easy to get past. I'm confident that I won't smoke again and I'm also confident that the cravings will completely stop eventually, too. Until then, I just won't smoke today.

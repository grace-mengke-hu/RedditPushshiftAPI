Smoked after 14 days

I've been smoke free for 14 days. But today I had a cigarette, because a friend gave me one upon my request. And honestly it tasted horrible! Why did I do this to myself for so many years, I don't understand. Now I really appreciate that I stopped.

Just wanted to share this, because people here probably understand me the most. And if any of you caved in, and had a cigarette, dont give up! It's just a slip, it does not mean you are a smoker again!

I did 20 minutes of cardio today. When I first quit I could barely handle 5 minutes. What a huge change in &lt;2 months...

...Iâ€™m also going on day 11 without alcohol. It feels similar to quitting smoking. The good news is that I donâ€™t want to smoke anymore. I am still cautious that a craving may come but it has been a while without any. ðŸ˜Š

2nd try

Last year in May I stopped smoking but I was not consequent enough. Sometimes in I used to smoke in bars with friends or on parties and festivals. First time it looked like it was okay just to smoke one evening and then stop again.

Last month it became more and more so at least I was smoking every evening... So I decided to start again with quitting. 

Like everyone who started on New year's day I am on day 5 and it feels good. My current mission is not to smoke for the whole January. 

Wish me luck and power to do it!

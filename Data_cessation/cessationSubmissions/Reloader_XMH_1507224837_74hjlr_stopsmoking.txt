Went 31 days without smoking... then relapesed.

It feels disrepectful to say but so much stressful shit has happened lately, and Ive been having trouble, but  yesterday I found out my Uncle passed and it pushed me over the edge.

It feels disrepectful because I feel like Ive used his death as an excuse to smoke again. 

I know I can do it though. One relapse isnt the end.

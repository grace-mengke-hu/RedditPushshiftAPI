Just need some encouragement

I’ve been a smoker for 4 years. Started my freshman year in college, not really sure what motivated me to start in the first place, but four years later, here I am. I used to be a road biker, 50 - 60 miles regularly with no problem…but I can’t even bike for 5 minutes without feeling shitty and worn out. 

I tried quitting last week, made it 5 days without a cigarette but for some reason I decided to buy a pack and start again. I just finished my last cigarette…and I’m just looking for some encouragement..

I know that I can quit and am perfectly capable of it..but it’s so fucking hard.

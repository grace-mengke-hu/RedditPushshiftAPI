What is your timeline?

I know things will happen when you quit smoking, but I'm curious as to when these things happened for everyone (what day of not smoking they began and ended, if applicable).  Also, feel free to add other things I might have forgotten.

**How many days after quitting did it take for these things to happen to you?**  I'd like to know when to expect them.  I'm ready for them!

1.  Regained sense of smell
2.  Regained sense of taste
3.  Begin coughing up tar from lungs
4.  Stopped coughing up tar from lungs
5.  First noticed a change in your skin (good and/or bad)
6.  First noticed a change in your voice

6 months! Feeling accomplished even though a bit down

Sometimes I get down about my life. I want so much more to be happening for myself and I want less stress. I am working at it hard. I am a bit tired. But I have one thing going for me that I won't ever take away from myself. I quit smoking. 

I did that. And it has been half of a year! I can handle stresses of life without a cigarette in hand. I can have more energy to create more of the life I want with the freedom of having quit smoking brings. This helps me shift my perspective and I feel a bit more lifted in hard times.

Smoking wont help me with my pains and strains. It won't help me grow either.

And if I quit that it means I can do more positive things for myself. Compared with quitting some of these things are a piece of cake. Keeping the perspective.

Occasionally, I still really want a cig. But I know it won't help or enhance my experiences. I just move on with a glass of water or tea. 

I am proud of myself. 6 months came on suddenly. At one point each day felt like forever. Now the time has wizzed by. Wow! Keep going everyone. This does get easier and you will more easily be able to face life fully and with increased confidence. 

At this moment I mentioned being down. Thank you to myself for quitting smoking. Smoking only increased intensity of these tough moments. Now I know I can make it through  the tough moments myself. I  am tough. Thank you to this forum for your encouragement. Peace.

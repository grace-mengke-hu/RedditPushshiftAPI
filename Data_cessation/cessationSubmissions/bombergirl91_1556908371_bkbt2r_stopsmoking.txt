No nicotine day 1. Please tell me it gets better.

I decided to quit using my juul yesterday. I went through 1 pod a day and could feel my health and my wallet deteriorating. 

I can’t sleep, I feel nauseous, foggy brained, irritable, and hopeless honestly. I didn’t realize nicotine had such a strong hold on my life. 

When did you start to feel better and not dependent on nicotine when you quit?

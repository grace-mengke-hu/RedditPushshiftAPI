Just need some support right now...

So I had my last cigarette on the 8th of October, 8 days after the beginning of stoptober. Since then I feel like I've been doing okay, 110 days if I'm not mistaken. But tonight I've come home from drinking with my friends, most of whom smoke, I'm kinda drunk and sat in the living room with the materials to make a rollie in front of me. I don't want to do this, but I need someone to talk me down please. Help a friend out, yeah?

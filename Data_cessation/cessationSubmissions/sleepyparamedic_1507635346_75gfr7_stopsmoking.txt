Not sure why I quit...

After 10 years of smoking I stopped smoking. The first few days were bad, but I managed to survive through them.
I always enjoyed this bad habit of mine, but I only wanted to smoke occasionally in the evening 2-3 cigarettes. However due to low self control I was unable to do it the way I wanted and end up to smoking arround 25-30 cigarettes per day.
Now I am considering buying a pipe, so I can have those nice occasional moments for bad habits.

I am just venting out and expressing my thoughts now.
Thanks for reading and good luck to you all!

A month tomorrow!

I can’t believe I’m hours away from a month without smoking. 

Though it feels like years have passed, I can honestly say I haven’t had a craving in about 3 days. 

I’m weaning off Nicotine gum and feel that  have lost the chub that the first 2 weeks brought, and have returned to normal eating.

I’ve knocked a minute off my running time per kilometre, and though my energy isn’t what it was it’s not as bad as it has been. 

I’ve also saved nearly £300 British pounds... although I’m still completely skint so I’m not sure how that works and how I afforded to smoke, and can say without doubt this is the most proud of myself I have ever been. 

I’ve given up drinking just in case this is a trigger, and go to bed very early, I also don’t breathe as I quickly scuttle past smokers but I look about 10 years younger, don’t stink and can run up the stairs without coughing up phlegm. 

Life is good, it’s hard quitting, and probably an endless journey to stay quit, but since I am proud every minute surely that means I have a lifetime of being proud of myself! 

Long post, But i have the time since I’m not running outside for a smoke!

I'm ready to kick this habit.

My brother is a heavy smoker, so weekly we go and buy a box with 10 packs. He's a heavier smoker than me (with no intents of quitting) so he ends up smoking 7/3 packs in the box and I smoke the other 3. Every pack I open I turn one cigarette upside down and that cigarette is the last in the pack I smoke, and once I light up that last cigarette I make a wish. I usually wish for money, or love, or whatever. It's dumb I know but I'm on that last cigarette now, and I'm ready to make my last wish: "I want to quit smoking".

Now, with all that said these wishes are just superstition and I don't believe in superstition all by itself. I would like to ask for advice. Where do I start? Should I go cold turkey? I tried cold turkey a few times before without success, but that's the way I wanna do it, but are there better methods? What should I do to avoid letting the cravings get the best of me? After all, all I have to do is go over to my brother's room and grab a pack, it's too easy. How do I avoid smoking when going out for drinks? Those are the moments when my judgement is at its lowest. Are there any good apps to motivate me? Anything external to just sheer willpower I will welcome with open arms.

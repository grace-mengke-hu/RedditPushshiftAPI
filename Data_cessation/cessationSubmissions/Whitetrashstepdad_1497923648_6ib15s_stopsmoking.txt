How do I stop smoking when drinking?

26m. Smoked on and off since I was 17, so about 9 years. The most I've ever quit at a time is 6 months. I've never been a pack a day smoker but I've been known to burn through a pack on nights out on the town. 

I smoke sober occasionally, but generally a pack will last me a couple of weeks if I don't have any bar outings. The problem is, once I get some alcohol in me, I HAVE to have a cigarette. It's like programmed into my brain that after a couple beers, it's time to light up. Then the chain smoking starts and I've burned through half a pack in a few hours. 

I'm pretty good at deferring my urges when I'm sober. I get irritable sure, but I can usually distract myself. I know that if I just never drank, I could quit. The problem is, drinking is one of my favorite social activities. I'm not a heavy drinker at all, but I casually go out with friends regularly and usually if it's a Friday, I'll grab a couple tall cans from the gas station. 

Other than the obvious of just quitting drinking for 6 months or so until the urges stop altogether, anyone have any tips for stopping the drunk cravings? None of my friends smoke, so I'm definitely tired of being "the smoker" of the group. I hate cigs. I hate the way they make me stink, I hate my breath the morning after a night of cig smoking, I hate how I feel like I can't breathe, but goddammit it's a true addiction. 

Sorry for the rant, I want to kick cigarettes for good and be a free man.

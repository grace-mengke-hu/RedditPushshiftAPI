fourth attempt quitting vaping! anyone have experience quitting gum?

Hey! 

So this is my fourth time round this track. I'm trying gum now. Vaping has been my problem for a lot longer than smoking ever was. I'd quit twice before this summer, but it never stuck. Anyone have experience quitting WITH gum, and then QUITTING THE GUM? :-) Did you find it equally as hard as quitting cold turkey?

1. I smoked for only two years. Successfully quit smoking, but vaped for most of seven years.  

2. This summer, I read the Allan Carr book, and it was genuinely GREAT. But, I quit for all the wrong reasons, i.e. for other people in my life, not for me. Needless to say, that was a pretty poor motivator.  

3. I made it about a month, then flopped it.   

4. I'd never tried gum/patches etc before. For about a month now, have been chewing the odd bit of nicotine gum just to get me through longer periods of sitting through meetings at work, etc. I've NEVER been a gum chewer, but was surprised to find it quit effective at scratching the itch.  

5. A few mornings ago, I woke up, and just went, meh, I don't even want to vape. I had ZERO plans to quit that day. It was totally spur of the moment. I just chucked the vape, and I've not missed it at all. SO CLEARLY THE GUM IS MY NEW ADDICTION.  

6. My current gameplan is, make it a few days without the vape, smoker family and friends go home, and I move onto normal gum. The way I see it, the gum isn't all that much better than vaping. It's just nicotine repackaged. Does that sound reasonable?

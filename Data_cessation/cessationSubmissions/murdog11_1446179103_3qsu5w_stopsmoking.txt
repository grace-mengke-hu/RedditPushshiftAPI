I haven't smoked in 5 days!! I am wheezing and coughing at night.

I haven't smoked since Saturday night. I usually would smoke maybe 5 cigarettes a day and up to half a pack if I went out drinking. Yesterday I felt like I had the flu, I had a low grade fever, headache, body ache, sore throat and a cough. After a day of rest I feel better but still have the cough. When I laid down to bed this evening I coughed and wheezed. I am concerned. I'm in my 20s and have smoked on and off for a few years. I live in the U.S. and I won't be able to go to the doctor until my new health insurance begins in mid November. I realize there are some tests that I should do to check my lung capacity etc. I will get these done as soon as I am able. Does anyone else have/had the issues I am explaining? Or is it just coincidental that I got a bug the week I quit smoking? I'm very nervous about the worst case scenarios. Any advice on coping with these issues? I appreciate any and all advice on the matter.

Craving Today

I have a mountain of laundry to do, a dog that needs to be walked, I just yelled at the kids for having messy rooms (bad parent), I showed my shit side to my husband, my job todos are piled up, a trip to plan this weekend, can't make it to my Uncle's funeral. A mix of shame, anger, overwhelmed, tired. Haven't wanted to smoke this bad since I quit. Just 1, my head says.

Almost 1 month...still have brain fog.

Every time I quit I get brain fog and it doesn't seem to go away. This is the longest I've gone in a while and I figured things would fix themselves after a month but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm having trouble remembering things, focusing, being active, thinking straight, etc. Any help?

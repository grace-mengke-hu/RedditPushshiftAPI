First challenge down!

Got my star a few days ago, I'm pretty happy with myself.

To all those that, like me, suffered from insomnia after quitting, as well as very high stress due to sleep deprivation, hear this: it gets better.

And once you learn to deal with stress without using cigarettes you'll feel unstoppable :).

I will report back with an update in two more months.

EDIT: Watch the goddamn coffee. After quitting I found it to be more potent than ever.

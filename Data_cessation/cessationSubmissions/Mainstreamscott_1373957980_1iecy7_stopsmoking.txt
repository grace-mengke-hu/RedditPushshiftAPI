I'm giving this a shot... again.

So I'm 35 years old, and I've been smoking since I was 16. I'm currently a pack-a-day. I've been toying around with the idea of quitting again by the end of the year, but I just recently started a relationship with a non-smoker. I really care for her and I don't like the thought of her having to kiss an ashtray. I find myself not smoking around her more and more, and it's pretty easy. We spent the weekend together and I think I only had 3 cigarettes the whole time. She said that she doesn't want me to smoke, but she wouldn't ask me to stop. 

I figure now is as good a time as any, and nothing is as good a motivator as a girlfriend, so I'm going to stop. I've got 3 left in this pack, and I don't intend on smoking them. Wish me luck, I'm going to be a cranky jerk for the next few days. Today, Tuesday, July 16th, 2013 is day one.

Oh, regarding the "again" portion of my title, I've tried to quit a couple of times in the past, but I couldn't get it to stick. I've used Chantix, which gave me the best results over the gum or patch, but Alcohol consumption always gets me. Since I've toned down my partying over the last 2 years, staying away from the drink isn't going to be an issue, so I think this time, it'll stick. My girlfriend is very supportive and offered a "sexual rewards" program, but I declined, as I didn't want that to be a thing between us.

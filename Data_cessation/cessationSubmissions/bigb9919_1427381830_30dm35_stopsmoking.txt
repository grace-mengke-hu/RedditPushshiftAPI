10 days in and I need some advice

The not smoking part is going well...I need other help.  My new found sense of smell is making it difficult to stay in my apartment.  EVERYTHING I OWN STINKS LIKE SMOKE!!  Obviously the clothing and curtains are being washed bit by bit.  I'm gonna steam clean the couches and mattress this weekend, but is there anything else I can do?  It's seriously gross in here.

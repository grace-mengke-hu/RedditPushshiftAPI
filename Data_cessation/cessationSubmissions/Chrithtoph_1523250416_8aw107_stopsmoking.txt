Would Rubbing Nicotine Salt On Gums Work as nicotine gum replacement?

As in putting a drop on your finger then rubbing it onto gums? Sort of a nicotine delivery system similar to gum, but much cheaper. I am trying to ween myself off nicotine. I tried cold turkey but felt too angry and unlike myself.

I've been a non-smoker for 12 hours! WHOOOOOP. (And being paid £117,500+ for it)

Having had many complications this past 9 months with cervical cancer scares/ cell removals, I knew I had to quit. 
I read the Alan Carr. 
Didn't quit.

I decided to take the choice away from myself. I signed up for a Clinical Research Trial, and got admitted at 6.30am this morning. Smoked my last cigarette at 6.20am. 

I didn't have the will power or the strength, so by taking part in this trial (it's REALLY low risk trial) I'm not allowed to drink nor smoke, nor even leave the building for the next 7 days and 7 nights. I figured, if the choice is taken away from me, then I have to do it. 

Best thing is (except for them providing me with free food 5 times a day, whooop!) not only am I getting what I'm essentially considering free rehab, but I'm viewing this medical trial as actually being paid, even though it's voluntary (kind of, they give you a form of expenses). 

But, if I live until I'm 90, they've essentially paid me £117,500 (+allowance for inflation etc). As that's how much I would have spent on tobacco in the next 60 years.

Not bad for a week in a hospital bed.

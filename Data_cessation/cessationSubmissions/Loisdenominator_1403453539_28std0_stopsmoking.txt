My 1 year contribution: some /r/stopsmoking clichés and what they really mean

* **"If I can do it, anyone can do it"** is mainly used to say, I thought I had this super special relationship with cigarettes, that no one can understand. As it turns out, there are millions of us human beings and we all have the same issue. You are not special, millions have quit before you. Millions will quit after you. 

* **"Quitting is easy!"** is mainly used to say, this is way easier than I thought it would be. It is by no means so easy that I could repeat this process any time I want, but the fear of quitting is built up over the years into this nearly impossible feat. I assure you, it's not that bad. As a matter of fact, the benefits far outweigh the costs, quite early on.

* **"Allen Carr, Allen Carr, Allen Carr!!"** while it is irritating for many and worked like magic for others, please know that here is a man who wrote a book which thoroughly addresses and destroys every rationalization we have ever used for smoking. He is no literary genius, but the book is effective. At the very least, it will put you in the right frame of mind to quit, if you read it with an open mind.

I'm sure there are many other clichés we can shed light on. But for now, I will just pat myself on the back for 1 year of freedom after 21 years of dependency. I now smell good & regularly run 5k's, most of the time simultaneously lol.

Parting advice if you are pondering quitting:

* keep reading on /r/stopsmoking, eventually someone will write the words that will spur you into action. That's how my journey started. 

* focus on the positive, all that you stand to gain in terms of health, money, etc. We all lived in denial about the negatives - it's the only way to actually continue smoking. The negatives are rarely motivation to quit, though.

* equip yourself with as many tools as possible, first and foremost /r/stopsmoking, a quit smoking app, reading to understand what your addiction and how your body will rid itself of it

Finally, I just want to thank my supporting cast. I never really looked for a buddy but these people became my compass: /u/esolu, /u/Armison and /r/tick113. Though they may not know it, they have had a huge impact on my journey and I am glad that they did. 

Edit: if any new quitters are wondering what 1 year feels like? I rarely think about smoking. As a matter of fact, I my mind cannot conceive that I actually used to smoke (weird). Only rarely will I feel the 'urge'. The most recent one was as a result of stress, but not the urge to relieve the stress, but that 'reward' one for having achieved much under stressful circumstances. It was so weak, it's laughable. I just did something else and it completely disappeared. As for weight, I didn't gain anything. If I am honest, I did gain 3 lbs, but that was in the last 2 weeks of eating like a pig and not exercising with visits of friends and travel to visit family. That should get under control as soon as I start running again. Speaking of which, I have ran 2 5k races since stopping. My aim is to run 5 5k's this summer :)

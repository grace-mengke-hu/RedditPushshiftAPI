This is so weird...

I quit last week and lasted 5 TORTUROUS days before I caved. I mean I was crying every day, anxious...constantly thinking about cigarettes. I smoked one cigarette on Halloween and bought a pack Saturday morning. I smoked that pack Saturday and Sunday while I read Allen Carr's book. I finished both the smokes and the book Sunday at 5:30pm. I haven't had one craving. I thought about cigs several times yesterday but it didn't bother me at all. What the hell is going on here? Was I hypnotized? I'm not rejoicing just yet because I'm only 2 days on but it's so much easier this time.

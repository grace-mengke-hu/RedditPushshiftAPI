What I think about when I want a smoke....

I am just over two months in and I finally feel like I can go hours at a time without thinking about smoking. But when my mind inevitably stumbles on "I want a cigarette so #^$%ing badly right now", I try to remember these things.  

Distraction goes a long way. Once it becomes a mental game, your attention is your weapon. Pay attention to something else and the craving (or smoking thoughts) lose power. 

Your brain has to literally restructure itself. The neurochemistry in your brain has to physically change to accommodate all the changes that quitting entails. Sometimes I have to just try to zone out and trust that my brain can do the heavy work for me and I just take deep breaths. 

It does get the slightest bit easier every day. 

Going to bed earlier than usual helps to fight the evening boredom cravings. 

No matter what faith or philosophy a person believes, a healthy body is a rare and precious gift, and we get it for so little time. 

I hated about 80% of the cigarettes I smoked.  

I don't want to have to go through that first week again. 

Quitting is incredibly hard, and anyone who quits should be very proud.

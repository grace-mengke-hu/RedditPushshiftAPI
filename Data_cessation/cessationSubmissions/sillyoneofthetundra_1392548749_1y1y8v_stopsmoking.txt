If you need any tips, I have stopped smoking over 7 years ago

Yeah, I actually had a friend who helped me somewhat, and I also did some crazy things like not smoking until I got to the top of a mountain (I live in Colorado).  I also used suckers for when I got in the car, as one trigger I had was smoking in the car, so I substituted suckers for a while.  I had a friend who I could call if I needed to complain, which actually really helped.  Also, I quit hanging out with smokers.  All of these things helped.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  It is the least I can do for people who really want to quit.  If I can, anyone can.  I was up to two packs a day shortly before I quit.

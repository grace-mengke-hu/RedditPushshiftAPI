I've quit because ...

I'm a 29 year old male and have been smoking for 11 months after 6 years of being a nonsmoker. The relapse was caused by a breakup.
Last Friday I realized I was well into my second pack and noticed how horrible the smell in my clothes was. I decided to go cold turkey. Now I'm eating fruit whenever I get a craving and my appetite is back to normal.

* I've quit because I can no longer stand the smell of smoke on my clothes and in my house.
* I've quit because I have no appetite and I've lost a lot of weight (-10 kg ; I'm so skinny! )
* I've quit because I feel that smoking takes away a lot of my energy and motivation.
* I've quit because I am coughing my lungs out.
* I've quit because I have vitiligo and I hope no-smoking will speed up my re-pigmentation progress

4 days into quit. Having a panic attack at work.

I was fine for a few days. Today is the fourth day of my quit and the first day back to work as a non smoker. I've been having this panic attack for 30 minutes. I think I'm getting sent home out of kindness of my manager. Please any advice will help. Thank so much

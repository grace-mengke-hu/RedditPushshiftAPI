After a few years off and then back on I'm off again. Day 1 complete.

I managed to quit for a few years and for some stupid reason took it up again about 12 months ago. Finally quitting again and just finished day 1.

I really want to get off this shit, I hate being controlled by it and living my life around it. This time I'm done.

Removed my badgeâ€¦

I'm doing "well," but I've removed my badge because the rising tally somehow tricks me into feeling like it's okay to suck on a cancer stick. Same thing with the apps. I deleted mine. Does that happen to anyone else? 

Anyway, I'm heading sleep after another day smoke free! ðŸ˜´ 

Max power!

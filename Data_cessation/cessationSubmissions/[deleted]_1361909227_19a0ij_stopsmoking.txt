100 days smoke free, ran my first 5k today and after 2 years of reddit, I will kick this addiction as well.

Thanks to you fine folks and the magnificent Mr. Allen Carr I am a member of the 100 days smoke free club, thanks to /r/c25k I am on my way to my first ever competitive race and I hit a major milestone today: My first ever 5k. Also, today my reddit account is two years old and I will celebrate the occasion by deleting it. I know I will never smoke again, I know I will never quit sports again and I will fight my final addiction: Wasting hours of my life by looking at pictures of cats.

I honestly from the depths of my heart want to thank you guys, your stories and advice made quitting a whole lot easier. And to all you guys who are thinking about quitting or struggling through the first few days of it: If I can do it, you can do it. Trust me. My life got 300% better in the last 3 months and quitting was THE major key to it. It gets easier every day and you will start to love yourself a little bit more every day.

So long and thanks for all the motivation!

66 days in: are these symptoms normal? Experience needed.

Came from a pack a day addiction. Used NRT for 2 weeks and then cold turkey. Not smoked 66 days by now.  

Feeling a lot better: but three, I guess side effects, are still there:

1. Keep waking up every night between 3 and 5 and hardly can get back to sleep. Drives me insane after 2 months!
2. I am super hyperactive in my head; thought streams are crazy. A lot of thoughts. One after another. 
3. This ball of alertness/anxiety/explosive nervous feeling in my belly that is there allll day long.

If I was sure its probably a fase I would be fine with it. But secretly worrying it will stay like this forever. Maybe permanent brain damage and it will never be better?

Most sources say the addiction should be gone in a couple of weeks. A month tops. Anybody with the same experience?

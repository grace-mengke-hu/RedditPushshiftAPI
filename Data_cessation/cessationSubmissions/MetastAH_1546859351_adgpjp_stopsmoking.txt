5 Days without cigar, i'm in my worst mood

5 Days without it, i didnt think it would be so hard, i'm really grumpy with everyone and dont know how long it's gonna take. 

I've dreamt about cigar, and that i was smoking and woke up in panic. It may be good or not.

I really dont want to smoke but it's weird, everyone around me suddenly started smoking, it's a freaking test.....

But i'll read some posts from people who is already some good time without it, to    
strengthen my will.

Ty for hearing!

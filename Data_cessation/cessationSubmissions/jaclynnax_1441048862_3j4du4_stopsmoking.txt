Not so proud anymore...

Someone made a comment about how they can't stand people quitting smoking complaining about it and/or celebrating their "achievements" because they shouldn't have gotten addicted in the first place. Any thoughts on this? I was pumped because I've been doing so well with quitting and this hit kind of hard.

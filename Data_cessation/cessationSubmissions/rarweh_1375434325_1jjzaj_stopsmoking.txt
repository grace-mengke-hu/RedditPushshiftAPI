I need the final push to actually quit. Can you guys give it to me??

All of my friends are smokers, my family, and all around campus. I've been smoking for nearly 6 years, and I know it's time to stop. My heart isn't it in, but probably wont be for awhile, but I need a good kick in the butt. Someone kick my ass into really believing in myself and wanting to!

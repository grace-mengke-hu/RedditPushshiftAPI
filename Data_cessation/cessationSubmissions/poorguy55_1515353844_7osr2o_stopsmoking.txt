Heightened sense of smell

I've only quit for a week but already Ive noticed some big changes. One of which is a heightened sense of smell especially in terms of cigarette smoke. I never used to smell it that much when I smoked. But now I can be upstairs and my girlfriend can be outside smoking I can smell it all the way up in the bedroom. And I can smell it on her breath really bad I never used to before I guess because I smoked. It's good in a weird though because when I smell it now I hate the smell so it's actually putting me a bit off smoking again.

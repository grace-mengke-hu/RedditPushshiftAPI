Relapsing issues..

Hey guys! First off, thanks for you all being here! This subreddit really has helped me out a lot. :)

So, I've been stuck in a loop for a month or so. I'll not smoke for 3 or 4 days, and then have a few social drinks, smoke one cigarette, and then repeat the cycle! I'm frustrated because it seems like it won't be a big deal, and then afterwards I just feel silly for doing it. I smoke organic, untreated tobacco, and only feel the cravings strongly after I have been drinking.

Anyways, it's really hard for me to get out of the craving mindset and to say no to the addiction. Has anyone had a similar experience? Thanks for your support! I'll make it through it! Peace and love

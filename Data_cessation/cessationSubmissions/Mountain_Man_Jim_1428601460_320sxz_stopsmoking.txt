Powering through day 4. Have a question!

2 packs of reds and 1 can of Copenhagen wintergreen a day for the past 7 years. Going cold turkey. I've been doing crunches every time I get a really bad craving and eat an apple. My mind is racing though, I feel twitchy and on edge. Like I could hulk out at any moment on something so minor.  Can't stop moving haha. Thought I was supposed to be tired? Sorry for rambling. My question is, is there an app to keep track of my progress? Do any of you use them? Just something to remind myself to keep going? Never realized it would be this tough! Thanks for the support. This thread is awesome.

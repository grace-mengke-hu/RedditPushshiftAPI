I want to be done.

My birthday is soon, I'll be 31. It's not convenient any more, back in the day there were still places you could smoke, my favorite bars have band smoking. I worry about money all the time but yet I buy cigs almost daily. Pretty girls don't like smoking. It's holding back my fitness goals. It's time to be done.

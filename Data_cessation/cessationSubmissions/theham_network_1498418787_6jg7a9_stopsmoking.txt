A month clean and I'm not getting any phlegm?

So I had my last cigarette a month ago, but I'm not getting any phlegm coming out of my lungs and virtually everybody told me that at some point I'll start coughing everything out, as a side note I am using one of those logic vapes to keep cravings away and smoke immense amounts of weed still so I was wondering if it's because of those things

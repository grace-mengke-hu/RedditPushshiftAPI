Just realized it's been over a week. My experiences so far.

It's a weird feeling to not be counting the days since I quit every day when I get up. It hasn't been that long, but I don't feel the cravings like I did before; days 2-3 were hell on earth, but once those were over, it was pretty zen.

I look at people outside the window and see them smoking and feel a little pull- but just a little one. In the past, I couldn't make it 5 days without bumming a smoke from someone and smoking every day.

Of course, I've lost count of what number attempt this was to quit. I was 16 when I started, and I'm 28 now, and I've recently had nodules appear on my lungs between CAT scans. I was told they are nothing to worry about, but I got married and decided I wanted to stick around on this planet with my husband a while longer, so putting it down didn't seem like such a bad idea this time.

After all, I promised him I'd stop. Maybe that's what had made it a little easier this time..

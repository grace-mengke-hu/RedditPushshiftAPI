A great book for this quitting and making overall personal improvement

The Willpower Instinct is a great book about how to change bad habits and build your personal willpower muscle. I'm not affiliated with this book at all, just thought I'd share. 

Listening to this book made me think about this subreddit, 1) bc it talks about tools for stopping smoking, 2) stories about smoking cessation medical studies, 3) how tackling one bad habit, can improve other aspects of your life. (Hello r/stopsmoking weight loss and fitness success stories) 

The author is a Stanford professor, it's an easy read with actually good actionable insights. And psychological  reasons why we fail using conventional methods to make personal changes.

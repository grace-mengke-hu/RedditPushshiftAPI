Quit just in time for PMS...

I decided to quit on New Years Day knowing full well my period was coming. Yesterday my mother asked me what I had for breakfast and I broke down crying... parents and their questions!

Anyway, if anyone's going through this, know that I'm here for you especially because fuck that was a nasty experience and difficult to get through alone.

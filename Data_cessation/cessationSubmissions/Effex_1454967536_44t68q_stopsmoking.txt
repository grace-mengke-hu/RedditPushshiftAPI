Do E-cigs count?

I switched over to E-cigs back in 2009. Before then, I smoked for about 10 years.

But I finally let it all go. One week ago today, I went from 24mg heavy vaping down to 0, cold turkey. It's been tough as hell, but I need to let it go.

I'm hoping I can rid myself of this for good.

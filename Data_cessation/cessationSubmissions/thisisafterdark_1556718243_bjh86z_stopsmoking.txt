Day 3 &amp; Question

I’m glad I found this sub-Reddit. Your stories are super inspiring which is exactly what I need on day 3 of my quit.

Question - At what point in the quit journey do you think someone officially makes it to ex-smoker status? 1 day? 1 month? 1 year? Etc. 

I know this is subjective but I’m curious to see where we all place that achievement.

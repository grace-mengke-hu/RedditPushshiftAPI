Keep breaking my promise

I used to smoke an average of 17 cigarettes a day and I'm down to only 1-2 cheap cigars a day. I've promised to someone important to me countless times that this one will be my last and keep going out and buying one then making excuses like I'm having bad headaches or other similar things. I just dont know how to fully quit but really want to not just for them but for myself aswell. Any advice?

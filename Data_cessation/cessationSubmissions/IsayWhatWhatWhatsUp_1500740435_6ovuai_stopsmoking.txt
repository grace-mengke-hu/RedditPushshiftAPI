Cold Turkey Thread!

I bought my last pack today, and tomorrow is the day I quit cold turkey. I'm hoping to make a thread about it will motivate me to not give up on it, because if I tell people I'm quitting I'd be too ashamed to cave in.



Also, I think It would be cool to have a thread where I (and others if you'd like to join!) can write a comment each day, kind of like a journal. I think it would be helpful to detail what it's like quitting cold tukey, so people who are planning to quit in the future can know what it will be like and know that they can make it through!



For anyone who is planning on quitting or wants to quit, I'd love for you to join along!

My cheating friend.

Hey! Celebrating over two months of being a non-smoker and it's going quite well.  If only I could lose the weight I gained in the last two months, though..

However, I'm here to talk about my friend, we shall call him Mike. Now, Mike has a stressful job and travels a lot. He has been trying to quit smoking for several times now. Once with allan carr's book, once with patches, once with e-cigs, once with cold turkey...

However, he is now a few weeks into cold turkey. He told me, proudly, that he doesn't need to smoke anymore - he is 3 weeks off! But then he told me he takes drags off other people's smokes.

Now, I wonder, why? Why does one quit smoking and still bum drags out of friends? Is that really considered "quitting"? Am I right for going for full-fledged avoidance for everything nicotine?

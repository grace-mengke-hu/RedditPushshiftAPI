Day 3... And it's easy.

I've been smoking almost 5 years. I've tried giving up a few times before, and failed. But this time I'm at the 3 day mark and well, I almost forgot I smoked in the first place. I've had a few cravings, but resisting has been pretty easy, just asking myself why I feel the need to go and inhale toxic smoke to feel 'good' is fairly effective. Feeling optimistic, wish me luck!

Indian users who quit using a e-cig. Also US users.

I really really want to quit but due to my stress and work and family, I can't. I am too young and its starting to show its ugly signs. I have tried e-cig 4 times, out of which the first one was working great till it just stopped working. The rest three were e-hooka and they never felt like a cigarette.

I want something that feels like a cigarette, small like an actual one. Where can I get quality e-cig online or offline? If I order online from US, which is the best brand quality wise? 

Something that lasts and is good quality, not some repackaged china brand.

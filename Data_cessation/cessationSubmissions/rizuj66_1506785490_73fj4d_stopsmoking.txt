60 days - and for my anniversary I got a nice, fat, craving....

Can't let your guard down for a minute....I tell ya...thought the cravings were behind me but got a couple of beauties today. Goes to show one cannot be complacent. Have a perfect way to deal with them. Just grit teeth, swear inwardly and then ignore. They go away. Was talking it over with a colleague today. All the previous times I've quit have been for relationships. Now I've done it just for me. I think this time will be successful, as I've stuck around myself a lot longer than any of the relationships lol....

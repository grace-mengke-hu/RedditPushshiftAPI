How to get rid of the cravings?

I smoked constantly (chain smoker) throughout a 3 month period so it was relatively easy for me to just quit cold turkey when I did. That was a year ago. But after I quit, I still had the tendency to bring my fingers to my lips as though I had a cigarette in my hand and I still have cravings pretty frequently. These cravings are resistible though but I feel as though one day I will give in and buy a carton of smokes. The feelings are especially strongest when I feel depressed which occurs somewhat frequently. I know my "problem" (if you can even call it that) is minuscule in comparison to others but I would still like to get rid of these urges to go out and grab a smoke. I really think that there's no real way to get rid the cravings and that it just something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life which isn't so bad honestly when I think about it (in comparison with others I mean).

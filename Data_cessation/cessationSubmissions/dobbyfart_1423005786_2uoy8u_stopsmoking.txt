All right guys, I'm back

Well. I fell off the wagon. What are you gonna do? I let stress dictate what I wanted and I justified the day away. 

Honestly, what I want is to see my co-workers go outside to smoke and not mind. I want my stress response to be to do some deep breathing instead of deep nicotining. I don't want to smell cigarette smoke and feel intense yearning. I don't want to bring my daughter up in a house with a parent who smokes.

I want to quit!! So great job every body for sticking to your quit. You're doing a lot better than me! Just think of how shitty it feels to remember you were trying to quit. It feels very shitty.

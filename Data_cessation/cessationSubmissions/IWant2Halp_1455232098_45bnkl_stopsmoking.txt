My GF is one month in and is having such intense anger management issues, she's thinking of going back. As a non-smoker, I don't know how to help.

I've been encouraging her to quit for months and she finally took the plunge. She got past the worst of the cravings and was really pleased and proud of herself.  She was doing really well (one drag in the last four weeks) but has recently begun feuding with one of our housemates (this is a personality conflict that's been building for a while).  Out of the blue last night she said "I think I need to start smoking again."  I was totally taken aback and asked why and she sort of broke down and said she thought it would help with her getting angry at our housemate and also dealing with other stresses in her life that had been weighing on her.  She's spent a lot of the last week enraged and/or in tears.

I said "I can't possibly believe this is a good idea."  And she said "I don't expect you (as a non-smoker) to understand, but I just don't know what to do."

She gave me the impression she's already given up and just hadn't gone out and bought a pack yet.

I'm NOT getting in her face and getting judgmental.  I'm trying really hard not to push her in a mean way and to let her make her own decisions.  But I'm disappointed.  I want to help and I ESPECIALLY want to offer her meaningful alternatives to returning to tobacco use.

Can you folks give me any guidance?

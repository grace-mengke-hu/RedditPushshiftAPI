Leaving for Army BCT

Hello Everyone,

I leave for Army BCT in exactly 2 months, I also have a Ranger contract which means I will have a lot more running/rucking eventually in my training. I have been smoking about 2 packs/week for approximately 2 years and would really like to quit before leaving. My question is how much improvement will I see in lung function/endurance if I were to quit immediately? I currently can run a 14 minute/2 mile and am hoping I would be able to get to a 13 minute before leaving purely from quitting, possible?

Thank you

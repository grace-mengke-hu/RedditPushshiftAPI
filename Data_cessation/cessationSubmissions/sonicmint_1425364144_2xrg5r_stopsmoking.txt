Reset my badge?

Last night I had some of my friends joint (I used to occasionally smoke a bit of pot on some weekends) which was mixed with tobacco. I did regret the decision straight after as I have gone 21 days without a single puff of anything.

Would you reset my badge if you was in my situation? I feel as though the badge won't mean anything if I don't.

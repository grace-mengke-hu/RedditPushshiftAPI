Suddenly Quit

I went outside for a cigarette this morning, and as soon as I lit up, I put it out and threw my pack away. Wasn't planning on it, but it's almost like my brain just decided on its own that it's time.

Been smoking 6 years, so hopefully this sticks! Anyone else quit suddenly without planning to and had any luck?

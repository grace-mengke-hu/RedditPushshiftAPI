Sick of it... so here goes nothing

I didn't want to quit because I had to, I wanted to quit because I wanted to... well, I guess I've reached that point, I'm quitting in 3... 2... 1.

I'm used to smoking a pack a day so I guess I'll be in a pissy mood for a few days, any tips on how to avoid that are really welcome, I'll carry around toothpicks to keep myself busy instead of lighting one up, that has helped me before

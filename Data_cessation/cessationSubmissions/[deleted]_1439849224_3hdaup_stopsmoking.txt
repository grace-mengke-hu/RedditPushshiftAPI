quitting 6 days before school starts

Hey,

Nicotine often causes me pretty bad tension headaches so I was contemplating quitting before school starts. I'm a decently heavy smoker, ~15 a day for the past 3 years. Would I still be feeling terrible once school begins? I could manage this for the first week, so I would have roughly 13 days before I need to seriously do school work.

Does this seem reasonable?

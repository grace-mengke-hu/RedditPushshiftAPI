I woke up this morning and didn’t have a cigarette

I’ve been reading the loved Allen Carr book everybody seems to swear by. I took a long time to even pick it up, because well truthfully, I didn’t believe words on a page could make me not want to smoke.

I’m only a few chapters in and I think it’s actually working for me. I ran out of cigarettes last night before I went to bed. Normally that would be a near emergency situation for me and I’d go get some. But I didn’t. And I’ve been up for a while and still haven’t. I don’t plan on stopping on the way to work either. 

But I HAVE to start my day with a cigarette. It’s my routine and my day will be off if I don’t. That’s what I told myself. 

Maybe I won’t quit completely yet. But man it’s getting easier. What really blew my mind was that nicotine withdrawals aren’t physical at all. This is of course true, but I never thought of it that way.

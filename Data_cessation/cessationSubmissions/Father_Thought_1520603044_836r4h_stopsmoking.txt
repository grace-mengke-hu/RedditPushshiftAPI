Today is the ninth day.

Coming out of In Patient care (Had to be under 24/7 supervision while coming off meds I have a bad reaction to) I decided I had made it five days without smoking and decided to continue. 

 I've been using nicotine lozenges, and altoids.

 My friends constantly smoke and this is making me want to smoke again, but I keep reminding myself one and I'm back in the cycle of constantly smoking, and that it won't make me feel better. I don't want to go back to feeling sick in the mornings, less energy, yellow teeth and whatnot.

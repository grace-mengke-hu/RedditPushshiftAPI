Screwed up didnt I

Turning 21 in 2 weeks... being smoking properly, 10 a day for just over a year... been wanting to quit for a while cos I know its bad for me and I'm healthy and athletic but I cant seem to stop. Can never get past the one week mark. Got an app to finally do it, got 7 days in and was really proud, told my friends this was it, I'll finally quit and tonight I bought more fags. Have a crit at uni tomorrow abd the stress got me, started to panic and fucked it. Feeling pretty shit now. Probs not turning up to uni tomorrow

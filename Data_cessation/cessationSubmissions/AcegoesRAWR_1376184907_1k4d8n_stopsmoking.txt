I'm quitting very soon! [everyone says that, huh?]

I have about half a pack of cigs left and I have been beating myself up all about smoking.

Sure, you'll probably just laugh and say that I'm not going to quit or it'll last a few hours. Hear me out though!
I've read Allen Car's book on quitting and it helped a lot, but I never actually quit. I logically understood that the cigarettes do nothing and the reason I smoke. Also, I genuinely want to quit for myself. 

**Why do I smoke, then?**
I smoke because I believe it quells my anxiety and strong emotions. It does actually 'seem' to keep the anxiety at bay. However, I think I'm actually LESS anxious after not smoking for a period of time. Irritable a bit, sure. But that brings me back to the 'strong emotions' part. I kind of miss my old self who felt. Whenever I go for periods of time without smoking, it reappears. 

**What's the issue, then? Why the hell is this douchebag still smoking?!**
It's the comfort of not having to deal with emotions and the relief I get from spending time with just a cig. It's relaxation.

Anyway! I've been reading about quitting all day and it has reignited the flame within' me. Sure, it's going to suck amazingly, but the trade off is amazing. 

This subreddit has been a big help on controlling my smoking when I don't have any, but I'm ready to take the leap into never having any.

I plan on quitting cold turkey and not giving my craving thoughts the time of day. This has worked in the past. If I believe I will not be able to resist, I'll simply put myself in a situation where I can't.

**tl;dr:** Some random guy over-explains himself about the reasons he smokes. Almost sound as if he's stalking this subreddit...

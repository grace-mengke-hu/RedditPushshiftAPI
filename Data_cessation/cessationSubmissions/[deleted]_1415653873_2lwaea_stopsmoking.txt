I told my Best friend I'd quit chewing for him, Help me.

I just can't... I haven't gone 24 hours without chewing in 5 years, I figured this would be the subreddit to help quit nicotine. I tried chewing Sunflower seeds and having gum but I just can't get over it. So please /r/stopsmoking please help me, I need to do this for him, and myself.

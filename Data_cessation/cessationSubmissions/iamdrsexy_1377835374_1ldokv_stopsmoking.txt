If I can do it...so can you!!

One month behind me! Phew!!! I had been a smoker since 12 years old. Reached a pack a day by 16, and now at 2 months shy of my 26th birthday I believe I've successfully kicked this disgusting, dirty habit. I had tried to quit dozens of times before, but the difference with this time is that I did it cold turkey!! Patches, pills, lozenges, ecigs, and whatever else it out there may work for some people but for me was just something to lean on until I picked up a pack again. 

This time feels different, and I am never going back. Happy one month to me!!

"Looks like I picked the wrong time to quit smoking."

I decided to stop smoking a few days ago (catalyzed by some posts on this sub), and after a couple semi-cheat days had zero cigarettes yesterday. But of course, yesterday my car broke down and I ran out of money right after getting paid and today my dog ran away. This is a test. Still sticking with it (doing it mostly for my family), but my body is telling me a cigarette will fix everything. 

I just keep thinking of Lloyd Bridges in Airplane.... "Look's like I picked the wrong time to quit smoking."

Any support or advice is very much appreciated.

I honestly don't know how I got here (almost a month out)

Went on a 5-day business trip and didn't bring along cigarettes. My fear on returning was that I'd buy a pack on the way back from the airport but I simply did not.

I had been smoking for years and suffered a heart attack almost 10 years ago (maybe from smoking, maybe from heredity, IDK). I stopped after that but then, slowly, smoking crept back into my life. At my worst, I was smoking a pack a day. Stupidly thought the meds I was taking would stave off any further trouble.

The anxiety of smoking and having another heart attack was nerve racking but I couldn't seem to stop... until recently. I'm around folks that smoke but it doesn't make me want to pick the habit up again. I had a few cravings the first week and a half but I reminded myself of how far I had already made it. At this point, I feel I've gotten past the tough part of quitting.

Started working out again (after a year away from that) and am feeling a lot better in general. Not saying all of this is easy but I'm proud of myself for getting out of that smoking habit. I only smoked outside and I still head out to the porch but now I watch the skies, the trees, my dogs and the neighbors passing by.

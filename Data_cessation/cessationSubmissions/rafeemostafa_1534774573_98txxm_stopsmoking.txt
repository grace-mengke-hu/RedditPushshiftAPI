Just smoked a cigarette mindfully

And God... this thing really is disgusting. The tobacco smells horrible even before it's lit. I've always "enjoyed" cigarettes, but when I'm actually aware of what I'm doing, is a whole different story.

Inhaling smoke - SMOKE, flicking off ash that ruins anything it touches, tar going down the throat into the lungs.. it's finally clear how unnatural this thing is. A smoke a pack a day, but by the end of this 1 cigarette, I was gagging and spitting continuously. Even now, ten minutes later, I feel repulsed and disgusted by what just happened to me.

Personal Challenge: Over the next few days, I can smoke if I want to, but never enjoyably. If I can take a break to smoke, I definitely have enough time to do it mindfully, with full attention to exactly what I'm doing. The illusion of tobacco is gone for me now, **but I really can't afford to forget how I feel right now. This MUST be remembered at any cost.**

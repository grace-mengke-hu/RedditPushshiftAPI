Girlfriend is beginning to smoke cigarettes, more often.

Basically my girlfriend started smoking cigarettes mildly, a pack or two every week, a year ago. Now she smokes a little more, but nowhere near a pack a day. I am concerned she will slip into a pack a day type addiction, although she doesn't seem to think she would. She showed disgust towards the thought of a pack a day. I believe she is just being naive, because I feel like all my nicotine addicted friends all began like that; They would smoke occasionally, and then 2 years later they are smoking a pack a day without any thought. I just think she isn't greater than others in that respect, I don't think anyone can really moderate nicotine, especially when she shows obvious signs of early addiction. 

These signs include cravings that are triggered by smelling cigarettes, being out at shows and after work. In our state of California the minimum age raised to 21, and she is 20 and is sort of fiending for cigs, like when someone has one she will attempt to bum and she will NEVER turn one down. 

All in all I just want advice on going about explaining the risks but at the same time not being naggy. I just don't think she understands the addiction risk at all. Thank you.

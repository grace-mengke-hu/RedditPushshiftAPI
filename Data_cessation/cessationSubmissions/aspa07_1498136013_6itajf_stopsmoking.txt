I quit cold turkey and it's been hell. A few days away from two weeks and craving as strong as ever!

I'm curious how symptoms were for everyone else. I almost feel like I've been overdramatic with quitting and withdrawal but it's been so difficult! 

The first 3 days were okay. I wasn't at work, and spent time with my girlfriend. I got back into work and day one was about ready to rip someones head off. I was clutching and squeezing my desk in just a burning anger for no reason. 

I've been sleeping like shit, waking up soaked sometimes. I've been anxious and paranoid about everything. I over analyzed a lot of my girlfriends moves and words and even convinced myself she was going to leave me. We've never had a fight yet and things have been perfect so I have no idea where that thought came from. 

I haven't been myself at all. I've been very irritable, very tired all the time, no energy to do anything at all. Even sex. I'm really attracted to my girl but when she wants it all I wanna do is roll over and go to sleep. I also can't really keep it up lately which doesn't help either of us feel better. 

Is any of this normal!? 

EDIT: smoked on and off for 8 years. Each time I would quit for a month I'd come back to it and smoke even more. I smoked about a pack every two days sometimes a pack a day depending on the day up until I quit recently. Just haven't gotten any more. I've bummed 4 total off people in the last two weeks when my nerves were shot. My hands were trembling at one point.

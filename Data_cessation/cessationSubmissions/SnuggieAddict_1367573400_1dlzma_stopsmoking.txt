Help me kick my ridicolous addiction.

So, Hey. I am a 30 Years old Woman. I used to smoke half a pack a day since age 18. I also have General Anxiety Disorder - this will be important later on.

So, When I hit 30, I decided it's time to stop. I don't enjoy smoking at all anymore, I want to get pregnant in the next year, and It's terribly expensive. So I signed into a local smoking cessation group. Everyone on the group took Zyban\Champix except me - I can't, because it increased my anxiety which is massive enough already. Two Months Later, Everyone stopped smoking - Except me.
I did decrease my daily cigarette intake - Now I'm on the daily average of 2 for day. Noon and Night. Sometimes I smoke 3, Sometimes I smoke 1. However, this is causing me even more anxiety and discomfort than smoking half a pack! My Sense of smell is mostly back and the smell turns me off greatly, yet I'm scared to stop completly. I think that at this point it's mainly psychological addiction and not a physical one.
My therapist told me I should take as long as it takes as long as I quit within the next year. I don't like it. I want to stop.

So, what do you guys think? How can I kick the habit for good? 
Also, I have a Allan Carr seminar on monday. wish me luck!

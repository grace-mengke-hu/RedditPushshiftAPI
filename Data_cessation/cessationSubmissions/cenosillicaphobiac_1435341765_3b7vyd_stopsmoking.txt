Day 2

Just hit 48 hrs (and 10 minutes if we're being precise).  Getting less hard, still think about it all the time, but I know the rewards are worth it, and just one cigarette will ruin the last 48 hrs of hard work and start me back at square one.

I made a deal with myself this morning that I would not smoke today.  We'll (me and myself) discuss it tomorrow, but for today the decision has already been made.

At work we are having lunch as a team, that should get me through one of the three toughest stretches of the day, the other two being the drive in and the drive home.

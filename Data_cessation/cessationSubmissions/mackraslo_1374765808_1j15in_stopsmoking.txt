30 Days!!!

This must be my 100th attempt but I have made it to 30 days and I feel fantastic.  The first week was absolute hell, the second week, was horrible, the third week was a pain, and the forth week just flew past.  Stay strong and know that it gets better as each day passes.  I bought a bike the day I quit and have been going for a bike ride every time I get a craving.  30 days later I feel the best I have felt in years and on my way to a healthy life.  I do not mean to gloat too much because I know how hellish the struggle is but I just hope this is taken as motivation and hope!  Good Luck everyone and keep fighting the good fight!  :)

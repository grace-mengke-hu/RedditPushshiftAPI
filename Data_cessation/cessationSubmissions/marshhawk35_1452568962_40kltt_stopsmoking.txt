What is your smoking hiding from you?

Here's what I mean, at least from my own experience. Without smoking distracting me from facing my emotions, I've realized that I have a lot of pent-up anger inside that goes back to my teenage years. Without smoking distracting me from moments when I feel angry, I have no choice but to be an insufferable asshole or to face that anger, understand it, and learn how to let it out in a healthy way.

Without the distraction of smoking, I also realized that when it hits about 3pm, my mood very often drops into a depression that lasts sometimes 3-5 hours. And you know what? This has happened for years. But just like being angry, I distracted myself with a cigarette when I felt that way. I dug a little deeper than that, and I realized that this daily depression stemmed from a particular part of a past job I despised, a job that stressed me out and made me miserable. Probably not coincidentally, I doubled my daily cigarette consumption when I was stuck in that job. Then I dug even deeper and realized that actually, I hate my career field and EVERY job in it has made me miserable...and misery meant I smoked even more to distract myself.

So now, I know I have to make a big change in my life where my livelihood is concerned - figure out what makes me happy, maybe go back to school, etc. And it's because there is no smoke in the way of me dealing properly with my emotions.

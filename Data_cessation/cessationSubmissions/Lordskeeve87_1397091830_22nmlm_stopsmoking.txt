Quitting at last.

So here I am friends and fellow stop smokers. This is my first time on here because I decided last Friday that I wanted to quit so I started down a hard  path for me. A little back story, I'm a 27 6'3" male who's been smoking since I was something like 12-13 really got into smoking at 16 and been a regular smoker since. 

Anyways Friday(4/4/2014) like I was saying was that I was going to quit and so i cut back as much as possible that day. It went from about a pack or more a day to six over night. It was rough I'll tell you that. I was gld to have friends and people supporting my choice and helping out keeping me distracted.

On Saturday my friends wouldn't let me have any at all, all day and it was one of the worst and most empowering days I've had in awhile. Until i got home and broke down and had one before bed. 

Since then I've kept to one maybe 1 1/2 a day. Heck just sitting her writing about stopping is making me want one.

Now to my reasoning, i decided to stop for my health, every time i go to the hospital I'm told i have high blood pressure but because i fall into that horrible area of well bellow the poverty line i cant afford those fancy pills lol. so i decided to stop smoking and already my heart rate as dropped I'm noticing a increase in my moods and I'm working at identifying stressers that cause me to want to smoke.

That all being said today is day six in my struggle with that evil beast of nicotine. I've read some of your successes I hope to add mine to the mix as my journey continues.

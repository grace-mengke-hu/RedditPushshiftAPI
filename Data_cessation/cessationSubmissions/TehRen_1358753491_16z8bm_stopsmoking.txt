I'm starting today. I'm terrified, but excited in a weird way.

I've made some huge changes to my life in recent years; I don't do drugs any more (haven't for a long time really), I only drink one or two beers when out with friends, I eat well and I exercise regularly. The only destructive thing left in my life is smoking, and I think that's because I've been too scared to quit. But really, what do I have to be afraid of? Not standing out in the cold for five minutes of sucking on a cigarette trying to convince myself it's making me feel good? Actually being able to taste food? I know I'll probably gain some weight but I can deal with that, there are worse things in the world than putting on some pounds :) Cancer, for one thing...

This week at work is going to be difficult as hell, but I'm determined to fight. Raaah!

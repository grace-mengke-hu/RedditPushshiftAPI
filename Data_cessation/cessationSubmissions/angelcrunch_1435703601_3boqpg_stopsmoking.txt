Has anyone else experienced this?

I've been smoking since I was about 17 and i'm almost 20. So about 3 years now. I go through a pack of cigarettes almost every other day. When i'm drinking, i'll go through a whole pack. I would like to quit smoking but it's hard. I think it's going to be easier though because of this.... The last couple of days I have been smoking a lot less because i'm starting to not like the taste of them and the smell and how they make me feel nauseous. Today i've smoked only two and it's already the late afternoon. I couldn't even smoke the cigarettes all the way down like I usually do. I've been smoking this brand since i've started smoking. I guess i'm just wondering why i'm starting to not like smoking all of a sudden and if anyone else has experienced this? This has been helping me smoke less and hopefully it leads to me quitting overall.

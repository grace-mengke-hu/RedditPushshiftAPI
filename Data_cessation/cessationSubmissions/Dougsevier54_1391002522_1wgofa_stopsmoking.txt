Started Chantix this morning.

1/29/2014

So after ~14 years of smoking, I decided that my health, my daughter, and the massive amount of $$ I have been smoking away .. I've had enough. 

I tried cold turkey multiple times. Averaged 1.5-3 weeks of not smoking, but always found a trigger that got me going again. Tried the patch twice. Never curbed my cravings.. at all.

So, after taking a couple of weeks to study up on Chantix I decided to call my Dr.

Yes, I certainly know the horror stories. The Nausea.The Night Terrors.. But I also know the stories the don't make the headlines. I'm hoping I am one of them.

So, it began this morning. I will make occasional stops by here to give any appropriate updates. Take care!

Day 2 begins... 1/30/2014

I understand that the full effect of the medicine has not taken hold. But, here are my observations throughout day 1.

- Much thirstier. During a normal day, I try to drink at least 1.5 gallons of water. Yesterday I drank over 3. Cottonmouth was rampant!

- Very mellow mood. Certainly not in a bad mood, just very mellow.

- I had a good nights sleep. Speaking of, no dreams to mention. I'm not a dreamer as it is, I may remember 2 dreams a month on average. Very curious to see how this part plays out as the Chantix takes hold...

- I smoked 4 less cigarettes than a normal day. (I know this is mental, but it is what it is.. I digress...)

*Edit #2*
Day 8.

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 days now. The medicine really has been working well for me. Zero bad dreams, hell NO dreams (as usual) for me! 

What I have found is that while the meds definitely keep you from craving them, the first thing that started happening was absolutely the taste. As if cigarettes don't taste bad enough as it is, they began to really just taste horrible.

No nausea to speak of either. I have strictly taken the pill after eating my morning bowl of oatmeal, and immediately after my evening meal. So far, so good!

Almost 3 months with an e-cig, cravings still here... Help!

If you'd have told me 4 months ago I'd be here, almost 3 months cig free, I'd have called you out for lying. Don't get me wrong I'm over the moon how far I've come.

I'm going to be totally honest and upfront about the e-cig, I have always had and stuck with 12mg of nicotine, lately I've been using it less and less - I went down to one small bottle of liquid a few weeks ago and have really cut down. For the first two months it made quitting simple, so simple I almost forgot about the quitting app on my phone until a month ago.

However, lately, what I (and I assume every other smoker) has always had to deal with, is the justification of one more. One more cigarette, or just buy a pack for a night or something. My brain goes crazy justifying this one more cigarette, not often for that long but it happens very frequently. While I don't always even carry my e-cig now, if I do use it, it does not hit the spot at all, and just doesn't satisfy that craving like it used to.

So I don't even know what I'm asking right now. Work seems to get more stressful by the day and I have less and less free time. I'm trying to keep sane, but I know I would be perfectly happy to walk into a shop and buy a pack, right now - and my brain is convinced I won't even regret it. The conversation continues up there convinced I will be able to keep it under control this time but I know I wont.

Any advice?

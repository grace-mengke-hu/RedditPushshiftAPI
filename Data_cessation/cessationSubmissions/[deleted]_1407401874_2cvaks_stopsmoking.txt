Help with the anxiety using meds?

In talking with a therapist friend of mine yesterday she made mention of asking my doctor about Xanax or Klonopin to help me with the intense anxiety I'm feeling.

I grew up with anxiety and depression and survived an eating disorder. I don't think the old adage, "it gets easier" is a one-size fits all piece of advice.

My question is to anyone who has taken either of these meds before. And, what were your experiences and/or reactions?

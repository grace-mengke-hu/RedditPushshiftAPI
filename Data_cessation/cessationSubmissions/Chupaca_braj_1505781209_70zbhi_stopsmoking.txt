Smoking out of boredom, looking for advice.

Short and simple, I drive for work and sometimes have a decent amount of time between stops. I get bored and when I first started the job, it stressed me out so the combination of the two caused me to start. I don't crave to smoke outside of work or any other time, just when I'm working. Any advice? 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone!

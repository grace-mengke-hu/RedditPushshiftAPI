Just smoked for the very last time

My birthday is tomorrow and I’m not letting this shit control my life anymore. I’m done with it and after 5 failed attempts, I will not let this continue into the next year of my life.

To those who have quit, you have my utmost respect and admiration.

To those planning to quit, let’s do this! Now is the time to regain control!!!

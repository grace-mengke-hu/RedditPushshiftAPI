A remarkable improvement in my running after just 29-30 days

&amp;#x200B;

I started running after I quit smoking. I used to be quite the runner (10km in 45 mins was an average performance) but that was back in high school, so I thought I'd get back into it to see how good I could get. It's been 30 days so far and I've seen some awesome progress. If you're looking for some motivation for your post-cessation exercise regime, please read on! (Full disclosure, this is also a thinly veiled plea for validation. But in things like this I suppose it doesn't hurt to be proud of every day free.)

The results of the first two weeks were discouraging. I would finish every run feeling as though I had just been washed ashore after a shipwreck, half-drowned and barely alive. (Not to worry, this is just descriptive; I'm fairly certain I had no fluid in my lungs, and my heart was \*definitely\* still beating.) I had tried using the same rhythmic breathing I used at the height of my fitness (4 steps in, 4 steps out). But I was facing a serious problem: I couldn't keep up the pattern after getting through maybe 50-60% of the distance because my ribcage and lungs seemed to be getting stiffer after each breath. I was so worried that I had fucked it, and that, for the rest of my life, exercise would feel like this. (Imagine living in a world where my actions have consequences? Wow, that's a scary thought.) I decided I'd just keep going with my exercise regime either way. After all, I had given up on smoking; I hadn't given up on my entire life. I made some pragmatic changes, like shifting to a 2/2 breathing pattern, and slowed down a bit. I still felt like the sacrificial lamb to a cult of asphyxiation fetishists but, this way, I had the small consolation of being able to get through 80-90% of the distance without my chest tightening. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the third week, things suddenly got better. My chest was no longer tightening progressively as I ran -- at least for the 2km distance. I stepped up the exercise to 5 days in that week. I felt good. This also alleviated my anxieties about the future. I realised I was making progress.

But here's the real kicker: the progress I made in the fourth week exceeded all my expectations. I got back home from one of my runs in the middle of the week and, as I walked inside, puffing, my housemate suggested I should go for another 2km. I told her to get fucked but, as I slumped down on a couch, I thought: she's right. Why not? And so I got up again and legged it down the street for my second 2km run. (I never apologised to my housemate though.) It felt so easy (by which I mean, it didn't get exponentially harder as I progressed in the run). I felt good. Every day since, except for my rest days, of course, I've been running 4km. I now return from these runs in a better state than when I was doing 2km runs. It's astounding. I feel very optimistic about the future. I'm going to ramp up my exercise in the next few weeks and see how far and how fast I can go.

10 Days In!!

So happy to be 10-days free of slavery to Nicotine!  Had my first "smoking dream" where I woke up thinking I had smoked a couple of cigarettes and I was so incredibly disappointed in myself when I woke up and for about an hour afterwards! When I finally realized that it was just a dream and that I didn't actually smoke, I can't express how relieved/proud I was of myself.  

For everyone going through their first day/week/etc. - HAVE FAITH! It get's easier, in fact it's easy from the get go! Congratulations everyone on making the decision to be free!

Please give advice for quitting using e cig.

So i switched from 1 pack a day to e cig about 2 weeks ago. I am very suprised how easy that was and still is. One earlier attempt to switch failed because of what i now know was bad gear and the wrong vaping technique. 

My question is: How do i best go about reducing my nicotine concentration and finally quitting. What do i need to look out for? How viable is this method to actually be nicotine free?  
Thanks!

Starting day 4. Starting to hit hard stuff. Tell me it eases after a week or something?

I resisted a bunch of cravings solidly today. This evening, right around my 72-hour mark, actually, I started to get hit: bad cravings, psychological stuff, believing that I cannot finish this work project without a smoke (and truthfully, I haven't been able to look at it all weekend, and now it's due). But mostly feeling shitty old stresses and sad memories I covered up by smoking. I want to feel them in general but I don't want to feel them right this minute--I really need to work. It's 3am and I just walked outside hoping there'd be a butt or a full cigarette left over from 4th july festivities. Thankfully there was not. I'm a junkie. Does this fucking get better?  
  
I think maybe it was easy to get to the 72 hour mark because everyone says "72 hours". But now that's passed and it's suddenly much more hellish. :(  
  
Sorry for venting and thanks!  
  
tl;dr: WITHDRAWAL

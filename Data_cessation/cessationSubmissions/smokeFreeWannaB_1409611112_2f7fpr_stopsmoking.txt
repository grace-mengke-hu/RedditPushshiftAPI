Staying motivated while dealing with side-effects

Hey all, first time poster but a long time lurker of this subreddit. 

First off I want to say that I've tried to stop smoking several times before... maybe three times, and have gone weeks without smoking every time, but something happens and I start back up. Which is honestly the worst feeling in the world. Maybe part of the reason I haven't tried to quit in such a long time. 

I'm a little anxious to quit again. I'm 22, male, living on my own in a new city where I don't know a lot of people and going to a University. Although school has just started for the year, I've already found a good routine and am pleased with how everything's going so far. 

If I decided to quit now, what are some tips you can give me for keeping my routine up and not letting the fogged mind feeling interrupt my school progress, and the overall drowsiness I feel after quitting.

I'm a heavy smoker, I do a lot of things in a day and have a lot of transition time where it's easy to reach for a pack of cigarettes. Also my mom was a long time smoker and quit about four years ago, and everytime I see her (every few months) I'm gifted with two boxes of patches and a case of nicorette. These have been the ways I quit before, and it hasn't worked, I'd like to try cold turkey.. I really hate the feeling of being dependant on a piece of gum or a patch that never seems to stay in place.

Any input is appreciated.

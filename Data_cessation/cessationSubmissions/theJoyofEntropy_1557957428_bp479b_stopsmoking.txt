Kidney pain after quitting smoking

I'm 6+ weeks smoke free after a 25 year cigarette habit, chewing 2mg nicotine gum once or twice a day to keep the jones off. So far, so good.

I've been eating well, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated, but this week  I'm getting severe kidney pain, which I've noticed before in previous, less successful quitting attempts.

When I've experienced this in the past, I've had ultrasound scans performed to check for kidney stones  or other obvious damage, with negative results and no real solutions being offered from my Doc.

Anyone out there experienced similar symptoms either with nicotine gum or when quitting smoking in general?

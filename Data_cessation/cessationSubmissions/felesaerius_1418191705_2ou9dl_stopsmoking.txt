Here we go again. On my 4th night.

This weekend was a real b****. I was bored, couldn't concentrate... just wanted to destroy things. I'm... now either getting sick, or my body's in major recovery mode, but I feel like crap, no energy, etc. Hoping this is a cold (well timed, I suppose). My smell and taste is better (not always a good thing, you smelled someone with BO? Peeyew!). I've been smoking off and on, but the most recent stint, I'd been smoking for... about a year and a half/2 years. Got up to a pack a day. Looking forward to saving some moolah. THAT will be nice. $50/wk.

One day

I’ve been smoke free for one day and 11 hours. I’ve been wanting to quit for about a year but never really felt “prepared” for it.  Then the other day I just thought - I don’t want to smoke. Just stop. It’s hard when driving, after meals, and after meetings at work. I’ve stood up and started walking to the door before realizing what I’m doing. The cravings are there but mostly it’s like well what do I do now during this break?

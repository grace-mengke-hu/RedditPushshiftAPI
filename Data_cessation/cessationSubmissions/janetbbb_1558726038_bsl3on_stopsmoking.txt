What has helped so far. 17 days!

Delay the urge 
Don’t say “never” just say “not now”
Don’t buy any.  (If I have them stashed away somewhere I will smoke them. )
Lozenge or gum will help
Sipping on a glass of ice water 
Remembering it will pass 
Knowing I am breathing better
White knuckle it sometimes. Again it will pass

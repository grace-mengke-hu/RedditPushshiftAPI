Really rough time here, guys.

Today was stressful waking up, because I needed my paycheck that was *supposed* to be in my mailbox last Monday, but never showed up. I have bills to pay! On top of that, my mother left for the East coast today, so having the impending living alone thing was, while somewhat relieving, stressful again. In order to find my check that was lost in the mail, I went to the post-office trying to find that AND a package my girlfriend sent me. I was already about to buy a pack, but I resisted. THEY FOUND MY CHECK! Yay! 

Then, on my way back to work, I went to go over to the next lane, and a car, that I believe was invisible due to stress, drove over the lane I was turning into and I hit him. 

I really need a cigarette. I've been at school since 9 am and I'm working until 9 (in the same school, I might add).

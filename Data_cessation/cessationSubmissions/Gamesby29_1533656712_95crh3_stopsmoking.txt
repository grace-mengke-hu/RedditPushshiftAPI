19 Days so far but this weekend is my first night out since quitting. Any tips/ advice?

I've been quit now for 19 days, and honestly I'm shocked that it's been this long too. I quit the day before I moved into my new apartment, so I guess the first few days where they're normally agonising for some people, I just didn't even think about the fact that I was quitting smoking for the billionth time. I have been vaping however which I find has massively helped! However this weekend is going to be my first night out, and normally this is where I fail. I get drunk, see people smoking, get the urge, and bum one off my mates. I don't want this happening again. This has been my best quit attempt ever, and I don't want to stop the momentum. So any advice?

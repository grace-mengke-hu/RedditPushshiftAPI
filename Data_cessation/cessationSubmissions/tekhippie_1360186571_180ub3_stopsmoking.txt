I don't care if ecigs count or not.  I'm tobacco free.

I ordered my first ecig in november and haven’t smoked since.  I use an ego c twist and have collected a nice case of flavors and tanks.  I got one because a friend of mine had just done much of the initial research and showed me what he found.  I continued researching to find what would fit for me.

As a smoker of around 15 years I changed over without a hitch.  This is also after already enjoying hookah, and I had switched to rollies for the previous 6 months as well.  I was used to changing up the way I get nicotine as long as I was doing something with my hand to face fixation.  I think this made my transition easy and seamless.  Once I had the ecig, I didn’t even look back.

I am the only of my friends that has been able to use the ecig  in this manner though.  Everyone else still smokes tobacco primarily.

I might still be addicted to nicotine, but my clothes no longer stink.  My lungs are clear, my sense of taste is back as is my sense of smell, I don’t wake up hacking up tar, and I don’t fall asleep wheezing.  My car smells like a car instead of old butts and my bank account is no longer getting that $6 hit every couple days.

Argue if you want, heck I even saw someone go as far as to put smoking an ecig in the same likeness as shooting up to satiate cravings from heroin.  People will find their way but I am proud of myself.  I am getting healthier and I found the way I can successfully do that.

Congrats to the lot of you who have successfully quit, even if you are using a patch, nic gum, or an ecig to do it.

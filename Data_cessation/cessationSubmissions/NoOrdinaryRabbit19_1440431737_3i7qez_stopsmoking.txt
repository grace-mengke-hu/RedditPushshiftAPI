Eight days!

I haven't smoked since last Sunday!  I'm not really sure how I've done it, and it's been very challenging, but I'm really proud of my eight days.

If anyone has more tips and tricks for me to survive after the first week, or if anyone just quit and wants tips on surviving the first week, feel free to contribute/ask here!

When does the rage stop? I want to cut off every single friend I have.

Today is my fifth day nicotine-free. I quit cigarettes a few months back, but I kept using my juul. Enough was enough, so I threw it away and started this adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last two days, though, I've been feeling inexplicably angry. I'm not a very angry person. In fact, I rarely ever get angry. I've deleted every app off my phone, a lot of people's contact information, and in my classes I attempt to make myself look as unapproachable as possible. Obviously this isn't enough to make me want to go back to nicotine. I just need to know how much longer I have with this. Does anyone have any advice for me?

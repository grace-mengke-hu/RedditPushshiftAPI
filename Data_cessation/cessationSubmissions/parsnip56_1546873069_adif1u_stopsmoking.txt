Screwed up on day 6

So, after being SO GOOD AT IT I screwed up yesterday, day 6. I had really bad PMT and I had to break up with someone who I love, and I went totally off the rails. Thought my brain was going to explode. Started off by scouring the back yard for butts on the ground. Smoked all the good ones. What a loser.

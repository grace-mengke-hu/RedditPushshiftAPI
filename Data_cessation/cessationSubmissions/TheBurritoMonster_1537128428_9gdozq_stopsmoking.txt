Follow from my previous failure and a couple things I wish I found when in panic mode.

Three days ago I posted that I screwed up. I took a few puffs off a cigarette and tossed it out. I'm returning to state I have now gone 77 hours without a cigarette or any nicotine! This is the longest I have gone for 15 years without nicotine, and can honestly not believe I've made it this far.  


To provide a bit of background for people suffering now. I started this journey 6 days ago. I cheated twice. Once after 24 hours and once after 36 hours of being nicotine free. Both times were three puffs and instant regret. Absolutely none of this process was fun, and can honestly say it was one of the toughest changes I've made ever. Below are a few things I did not expect.  


The absolute worst part of the withdrawal has been a foggy mind. It lasted about 3 days for me. Everything I found says up to two weeks. It is possible it can last that long, but that freaked me out. It also hindered me from wanting to keep going. I am a software developer and thinking through complex issues it what I do for a living. I was an absolute waste. It sucked so bad, and even took a day off because it was that horrible. **In the end your foggy mind does go away and you will be fully functional again!**  


The second to worst part was junkie thoughts. Hope that doesn't offend anyone, but its the best way I can describe it. Your brain tries so hard to cope with you why you can have a cigarette. You've gone 24 hours. You should celebrate the achievement... with a cigarette. Multiple hour long internal battles of 'smoke a cigarette vs no don't smoke'. **They say cravings can last up to 20 minutes. I call bullshit on that.** **Just keep fighting that urge.** Personally I found music extremely helpful to get through the toughest part. I seriously thought I was going insane, and it was never going to get better. I still want a cigarette and anticipate that will be there for a while, but it has been so much easier since when I started this journey 6 days ago.

Last thing that really pissed me off was night twitches. This was more of an annoyance and I do find it comical but was something I did not expect. Right as I fall asleep boom leg twitches. Start falling asleep again and pow arm twitches. rinse lather and repeat. It has sucked trying to sleep lately, but I've been trying to find humor in it more than anything.

As a wrap up I'd like to state this fact. **Quitting smoking is fucking hard**. You will hate yourself at times. You will love yourself at times. It's a rollercoaster that you just want to stop. Go with it and know **it does get better**. It honestly really does get a lot easier.

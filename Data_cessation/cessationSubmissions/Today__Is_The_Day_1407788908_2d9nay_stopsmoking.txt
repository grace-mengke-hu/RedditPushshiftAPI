Running for Autism thanks to you guys!

All right all right all right, time to make use of my reddit connections and do some begging.
I'll be running 3 weeks from Saturday for my niece Avery and need to rack up some donations to support the Autism Society of Southeastern Wisconsin.
As you may not know about me, I lack any shame in my life so I'm go to make you all an offer you can't refuse. Throw out anything you'd like me to do (magic trick, dance like a monkey, sing a song, shave my head, etc.) and I'll throw out a dollar amount.
If you make the donation I'll upload the video to YouTube.
Anybody game?

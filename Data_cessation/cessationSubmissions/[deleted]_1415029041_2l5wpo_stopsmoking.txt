Joining you

Hey guys,

Finally, ... after 6 years I decided to stop smoking. I'm 24 years old now. I can keep myself busy to not think about smoking too much. But than theres the moment, when my girlfriend asks me "wanna smoke?". How do I fkn handle this situation without starting again?

I tried to stop several times now. And it's almos impossible with another smoker living with you in the same flat.

please I need some advice!

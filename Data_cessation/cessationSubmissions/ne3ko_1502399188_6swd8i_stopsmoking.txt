SO began smoking again. What can I do to help her, and reduce my anxiety over this bad habit?

I figured this was the best subreddit to post about this. So a little bit of backstory:

We met a little over 2 years ago. I had quit about 2 months prior to her and I meeting, and I did not find out she smoked until our 2nd date. Just to be clear, I love everything about her. She's my heart and soul, and I am planning on spending the rest of my life with her.

She quit a couple times throughout the us dating. Her family was against it, and she knew I hated it, but she always communicated to me that she genuinely wanted to quit and didn't want to smoke for the rest of her life. We did most of our relationship long distance because I was in school in Colorado, and she was finishing up grad school in New Jersey, and when I would come back to visit, she would start smoking again. This was due to her spending all of her time at my house, and being around my step-dad who is a 2 pack a day smoker.

So we moved out to Colorado a little over a month ago, and she's been trying to quit. However she made it clear that she doesn't ever think she's going to not smoke when she drinks (which is fair, that was the hardest part for me). Though, she went back to waitressing, and industry where EVERYONE smokes, and picked smoking up full-on again. She smokes about 1/2-1 pack a day, and knows how much I hate it.

I guess what I'm asking for is:

1. What can I do to help her quit?

2. How can I reduce my anxiety about her smoking, to avoid putting a strain on our relationship?



TLDR; SO began smoking again. How can I help her quit? How can I reduce my stress over her smoking?

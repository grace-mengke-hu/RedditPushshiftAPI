Day 1 of the rest of my life

Today is my first day after 11 years of smoking.  I couldn't be more excited to take this step for my health, my family, and my wallet (more $$$$ is always a plus).  I'm worried about everything since smoking is such a big part of my life (as i'm sure it is everyones).  I smoke when i drive to work, i smoke when I drive at work (i'm a contractor), I smoke when i drink, I smoke before and after I eat, I smoke to celebrate, I smoke when I'm sad.....I smoke for every emotion and occasion I can think of.  The more I write this the more I am terrified of letting go.  But beneath all of that worry is still the excitement to take this next step, and knowing that all of you are here with the same struggle for whatever reason is comforting.  Here's to quitting the coffin nails!

11days in and struggling

I have smoked for at least 10 years, on average 7 a day but could do a pack when drinking. I'm fine for half the week but as soon as I'm stressed or drinking i really need a cigarette. I've had 1 since 1st jan which I'm annoyed about but also feeling bloated which is strange. Is anyone else having other side effects apart from moods and dizzy spells?

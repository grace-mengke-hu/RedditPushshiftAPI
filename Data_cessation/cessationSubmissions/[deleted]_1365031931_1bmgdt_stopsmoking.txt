Starting my most serious attempt today!

I know this is a generic "OMG IM QUITTING" post that this subreddit is made up of, so I'm not going to be cliche and post a picture of my broken smokes or anything. 
My girlfriend and I have tried multiple times to quit, we have a very bad habit of enabling each other and ruining the other persons' attempts, but we bought patches and are making a serious effort this time.
My main issue is that I am prescribed adderall for my ADD. When i don't take it or there is a gap in between refills when I don't have it, I have no urge to smoke, and the smell of smoke is downright disgusting to me. However, when the medicine kicks in I have insatiable cravings and I'll chain smoke half a pack. The combination of the meds and a cigarette really gives me a good feeling. I'm stuck in a vicious cycle because I have developed a dependency on the medicine, so if i quit taking it to help my cigarette-quitting attempt, I get incredibly irritable and unmanageable (from quitting 2 dependencies at once). The patches seem to be doing their job though, so I am hoping for the best. Good luck to all you other quitters out there, I have seen this sub help a lot of people, so I'm hoping it helps keep me motivated as well!

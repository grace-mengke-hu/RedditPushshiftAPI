Day 13

I finally decided to quit when my boyfriend of 4 years told me he wouldn't marry a smoker because his grandmother died from lung cancer. I'm not on day 13. Most of the time I don't have a problem with moving past a craving and staying strong. However when I get mood swings or angry then that's when I feel like breaking down. Since quitting me and my boyfriend fight pretty frequently and it is so hard to stay strong. Any advice on how I could get past these angry cravings?

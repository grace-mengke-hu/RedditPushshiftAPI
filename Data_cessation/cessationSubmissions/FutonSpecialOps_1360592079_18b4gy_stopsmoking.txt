Hello r/stopsmoking. Today I took my first Chantix pill to quit smoking. Wish me luck!

38 y/o. 22 years of smoking. I used to **LOVE** smoking. Now I hate it. Constant cough, wheezing, crackling, sick of this shit. Never tried to quit before. I hope this pill helps. Paid 200 bucks for it. I hope it works.

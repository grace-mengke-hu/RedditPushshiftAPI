Happy anniversary to me!

Totally missed my 1 year, oops! I feel like I can safely say I've quit now. No nicotine for 368 days and it feels good! I still drink and hang out with my smoker friends, going on breaks with them at work and all that, but am no longer tempted at all. Lots of dedication, but if I can do it, so can you!

I am quitting smoking in 13 days ... any advice?

Hey guys. 

I've been smoking for almost 11 years. 27 years old, military vet, and currently college student. 

As soon as this semester ends (in 13 days) I am going to quit what has been a habit of mine for most of my adult life. I've been a heavy smoker (a pack a day on average) for all the time I've been smoking. 

BUT NOW IT HAS TO STOP. I plain can't afford to keep doing this. Health, money, and generally wanting to live past 45 has motivated me enough to try this for the first time in eight years. 

If any of you kind people have any advice I would love to hear it. I have a little under two weeks to prepare for the hardstop date. And yes, I am sane, I'm waiting until finals are over to stop since I don't need all that happening at the same time. =)

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

my erections have never been harder in 10 years it scares me

I used to be a heavy smoker. In just 2 weeks of not smoking I've noticed (apart from morning woods every day) that I can hold a rock hard boner in every position without even trying. 

Once I had this 60%-70% erection when I was lying and not very aroused. It became 100% when I was in missionary or doggy. I now understand why women prefer most of their men on missionary. My girlfriend used to get mad when I was banging her without a full erection.

I never thought it could be related to smoking. I have an iron pole now while lying down and women just love the fuck out of it. I don't even have to move. They just have to thrust their hips slowly ten or eleven times before muttering an "I'm coming" followed by pleasure moans. 

On a side note, my penis and balls got bigger and are always on a increased vascularity state (more swollen). I have problems at work with my jeans since they often stick out in an arrogant way. I already have a huge penis and it became bigger.

I'm still extremely frustrated for having smoked so many years in my best years.

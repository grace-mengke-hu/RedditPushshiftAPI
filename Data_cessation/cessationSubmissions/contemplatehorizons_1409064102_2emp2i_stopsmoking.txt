Living with smokers

Live with 2 pack a day smokers who, thankfully, only smoke outside. Since I quit I've been trying to avoid hanging out outside at home as much but it's summer and beautiful weather and quite nice to be outside. It's hard to see them smoke but it's even harder, and I find kinda triggering, to smell it constantly. I have been changing habits and won't join them outside after meals or any daily smoking habitual times (basically always). Seeing them happily puff away seems to weaken resolve. Any advice?

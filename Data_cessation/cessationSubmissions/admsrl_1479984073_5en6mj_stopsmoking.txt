Craving help

Even though I have no nicotine in my blood, my cravings are getting more and more unbearable. My head starts spinning, my senses start to fail me, and I feel like the world is going to end. This sounds totally dramatic, but I assure you it feels like an onset panic attack 3 or 4 times a day. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop this as soon as possible? It's rendering me socially useless at the moment

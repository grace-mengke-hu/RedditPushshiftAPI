Get out of my head游때游때游때游때游때

I'm not doing too well today. I started to feel really angry last night for no reason and it has continued on to today. I am at work acting normal but my head hurts and I'm screaming inside. On one shoulder there's a little devil saying 'smoke! You will feel better!' And on my other shoulder there's a little wimp saying 'don't give in!' 
I'm listening to the wimp but I wish it seemed like a hero.

Day 1 tomorrow

I've had so many day 1's for the last two months. Every day I failed. I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post but I thought it would be worth posting for some kind of relief. Tonight I downloaded the QuitBuddy app and plan on sticking too it. I've probably said this 50+ times but after tonight I'm done, there are so many benefits to quitting and next to none for smoking and I want to know I can overcome something like this. 

Help me /r/stopsmoking .. You're my only hope.

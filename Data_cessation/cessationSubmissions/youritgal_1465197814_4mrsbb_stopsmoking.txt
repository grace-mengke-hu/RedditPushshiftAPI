one month and going strong!

I no longer cough horribly in the morning. I can run for the bus or up stairs without gasping. my lungs feel light and healthier every day. I feel "normal" again but it took a couple weeks of feeling out of it, exhausted and upset. but it was so very worth it and despite my occasional cravings, I'll never touch a cigarette again. 

I've posted in here a bunch since I've quit and everyone in this sub has been so kind and supportive. thank you for the help.

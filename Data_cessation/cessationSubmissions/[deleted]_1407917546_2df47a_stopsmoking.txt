I Made It To 21 Days!

I'm three weeks in, and really just incredibly proud of myself. Thank you all so much for the advice along the way, I'm sure you realized how much it helped, since you've probably used it yourself. For any new quitters reading this, here's the advice that helped me the most. Stop thinking if you can do this forever and only think is this specific cigarette worth it, in this specific situation. Even if I relapsed tomorrow (which I won't) these 3 weeks I've saved money, I've saved health, I've saved time, and hell other people don't have to smell me. So much gratitude to you /r/stopsmoking, keep up the great work for the next guy!

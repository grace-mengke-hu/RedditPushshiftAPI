Painful nicotine patches?

Okay three days in and the gum isn't taking the edge of the cravings so I thought I would try the patches.  My doctor got me a script for *Nicabate P 21mg 24 hour patches*.   I've been cutting them in half and avoiding the gum while wearing them as recommended but once the patch has been on for about 5 minutes I start getting a dull ache that grows to the point of being painful.  Doesn't matter where I put it; arm, chest, back.

Has anyone else experienced this?  I am wondering if it is a brand issue or something that goes hand in hand with dermal patches.

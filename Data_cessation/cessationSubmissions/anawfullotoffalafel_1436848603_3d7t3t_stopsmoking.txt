I really like having smoke in my lungs. How does anyone stop that sensation?

I'll start by saying that I am more of mj smoker ,but, I really want to quit. My biggest hurdling is my constant drive to fill my lungs with smoke. 

Now, I haven't smoked a cigarette in three weeks. But I'm cheating myself by using mj as a substitute. 

I really crave having smoke in my lungs no matter what kind. When I'm stressed, angry, after finishing something (reward) and especially after I eat as it makes my level feel low. I know when I crave smoke, but, I can't stop myself. 

How do you all deal with the feeling of having to have smoke in your lungs when you've quit smoking? It's like my brain forces myself to go out and smoke when I know I don't really want to.

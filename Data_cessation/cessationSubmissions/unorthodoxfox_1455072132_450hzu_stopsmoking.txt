I never realized how bad my cravings are until I stopped.

I made the decision to quit today around noon. I am only six hours in. My lungs hurt a little, my stomach is upset, and a small headache...yet I still crave them. It came to the point that it has became an unconscious habit that I only noticed until I quit.

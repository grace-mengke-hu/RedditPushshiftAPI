huge set back. need advice please!

I think i have been doing very well at quitting smoking so far. One of my coping mechanisms was running. I ran almost everyday and it really helped me stop cravings and clear my body of old gunk. However, I fell and busted my knee. I can barely walk, and for at least the next four weeks i will be unable to run/walk long distances. I need help because i am afraid of falling off the wagon. I cant use the tools ive set up for myself to quit smoking. Any advice? Thanks in advance!

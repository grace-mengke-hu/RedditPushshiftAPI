16 days in, on step 3 of the patch. Is head fog at this point normal?

It's definitely not as bad as when I started, but I still experience fatigue and what I can only describe as "head fog" 16 days into my quit. 

I have been using patches the entire time, starting with Step 2 (14 mg/day), and now on Step 3 (7 mg/day). I'm wondering if this is perhaps just prolonging the symptoms of withdrawal? 

Anyone know if this is a normal symptom of withdrawal and if it should still be happening over 2 weeks after quitting? 

Thanks!

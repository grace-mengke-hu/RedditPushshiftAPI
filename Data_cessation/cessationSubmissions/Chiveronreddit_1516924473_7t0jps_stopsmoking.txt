Nobody is as addicted as me, which is why they can quit and I cannot

* No one ever took their first smokes from their dead father's hospital bag containing his possessions from when he died.

* Nobody wakes up in the morning and bangs out 6 to 7 heaters with coffee as quickly as possible before their wife gets up.

* Surely no one has ever walked 2 miles in 3 ft. of snow to go buy a pack of cigs.

* Even the heaviest of smokers don't wake up wheezing from a night  of binge drinking and chain smoking, only to frantically look for their pack. Maybe even light one on the stove if no lighter is available.

* Nobody on this Earth would dread a nice trip to Napa Valley with their wife because they know they're going to be drinking wine and probably won't be able to smoke. 

* Who in their right mind would leave airport security during an hour layover to go roast 2 to 3 bones before their next flight?

* The worst smokers in the world don't dread occasions where smoking is unacceptable the way I do.

* Who the hell finds reasons to be away from their loving wife just so they can burn a few?

* What kind of person fears quitting? All these other smokers must enjoy it, otherwise they would just quit.

* None of my friends who smoke can puff through 5 packs over a 2 day bachelor party the way I can.

* What kind of loser eats healthy, works out, and cycles then fires one up as soon as he’s done?

My God, as a 15 year smoker this has been my mind set for so long and my justification for not quitting. Thought I was addicted in a way that nobody else was. Well yesterday, after booking an appointment with a hypnotherapist, I found this subreddit and read through every post I could find, along with the comments. I bought The Easy Way to Quit Smoking, churned through it faster than a pack of Marlboro Lights, and wow how wrong I was! I am exactly like all of you! Like you, I hate this dirty addiction, I do despicable things to support it, I lie to others and myself, I think I am hiding it, and I (until this point) have been so afraid of trying to live my life without it. All of the shitty things I do just to light up Allen described perfectly because he's seen them so many times before. However, unlike you, I thought I was the only smoker that really felt this way. Your stories and support are amazing and have given me a new outlook on quitting smoking. 

Tuesday, I wanted to die, literally. I drove for 8 hours to get home from a job, went through a pack and a half and all I wanted to do was let my truck drift into a ditch and see what happened. This is a regular thing for me as I drive long distances for work often and that’s smokey time! Cigs, 90’s alternative music and self loathing seem to be my favorite passtimes on the road. Today, I am so excited of the thought that I could soon be free of this monster! 

I have my hypnotherapy session on Monday and it cannot come soon enough! I have made that my quit date and when that comes I truly want to say "I will never have another cigarette for the rest of my life." 

I'll get a badge or whatever when my quit date comes and update how it goes if anyone is interested. Wish me luck! Thank you all for your stories and support for one another.

day 1 of quitting

day 1 has passed and it was easier then I had thought. I haven't really experienced any strong urges to smoke up till now but that might be because I am muslim and I am fasting from dawn to dusk so the only difficult part is when I break my fast at dusk after that there is a small  5-10 min urge period but I am dedicated to quitting and will stay strong. Thank you everyone for your support. I hope its get easier as days go by does it?

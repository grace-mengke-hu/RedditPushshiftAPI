After 1600 days I relapsed... I've just smoked my last cigarette, again.

I stopped smoking cold turkey my first time during college, I had smoked for about 3 years and I as up to a pack a day and I was just ready to quit.

So I didn't take adderall which I loved smoking on so dearly, avoided the bars, stayed in as much as possible to minimize time in my car, and for the most part just avoided high temptation situations.

Well I've been long since graduated and while at the lake with some friends I for whatever reason decided to take some SNUS when offered by a friend after already being a few beers deep.  Next thing I know I'm hitting my friend's ecig then by the end of the night I'm smoking cigarettes. 

This was about 3 weeks ago, since I went to EDC Vegas and then this weekend being the fourth I figured I'd give myself a fair shot.  So after making the 3 hour drive back home from the lake with friends I've smoked last cigarette on the drive back.

I plan on quitting cold turkey again, maybe using some herb if I get any out of control urges.  I'm somewhat already used to smoking on my 30 minute drive to and from work so tomorrow will prove to be either very difficult or very refreshing.

Wish me luck.  If I can't stop I'm restarting my day counter, if I can stop I'll just consider the past few weeks as a reevaluation period.

Quitting - how to distract myself?

Hi,

I quit smoking before - some time last year - but I could only manage about 2 weeks or so without smoking. Those were probably the worst weeks of my life. Not stinking was great, but I was an emotional wreck. Couldn't function normally.

I tried hard, but with my addictive personality 2 weeks was all I could handle. 

When I woke up this morning I once again decided to quit. So here I am, in my office, time ticking away slowly as fuck and I want to smoke so bad.

Guys, what are the little tricks I can do to distract myself/keep myself from smoking/cope when the cravings come when at work/home? 

Things I came up with:

- put a pencil in your hand/mouth to imitate holding a cigarette
- eat a small piece of (the darker the better) chocolate - to release dopamine

Thanks for your advice. Really appreciate it. 

Also, please do excuse my English. Not a native speaker.

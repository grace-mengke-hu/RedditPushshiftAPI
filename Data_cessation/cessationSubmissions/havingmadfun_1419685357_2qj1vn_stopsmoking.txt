I have been smoke free for 5 years!!!

Obviously the best thing I have ever done. I can't say that I ever get cravings, sometimes I did with my newborn son. These cravings are so much easier to overcome than those first few days of quitting. If anyone is in the first few days of quitting or hitting a rough patch, stick with it. I quite using Chantix, how did others quit?

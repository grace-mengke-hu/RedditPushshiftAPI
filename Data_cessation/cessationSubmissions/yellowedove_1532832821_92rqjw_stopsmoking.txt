How bad is smoking a pack a day but eating very healthily and exercising a lot?

Of course I know smoking is never helpful to health, but I'm wondering how bad it is if the other aspects of lifestyle are positive.

My partner smokes around a pack a day but as the title suggests, eats healthy and works out. Been trying to cut down myself (I smoke around a quarter to half a pack) but I wanna know roughly how detrimental that is.

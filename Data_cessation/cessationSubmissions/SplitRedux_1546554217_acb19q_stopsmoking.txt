Quitting Dokha smoking.

I'm a guy in my mid twenties, who lives in the UAE. I have been a smoker since 2011, and I have tried to quit multiple times. I will succeed this time.

Dokha is an Arabian blend of tobacco, which delivers a very potent dose of nicotine, when smoked in the bowl of the pipe, which is called Medhwakh. It has become quite a phenomenon amongst young smokers in Dubai, UAE. Virtually everyone in my friend circle is addicted to this desert weed.

The longest time I went on a quit was for 35 days, which was plagued by a black fog of depression, despite reading Allen Carr's Easyway. 

However, from all my quit attempts, I have learned that exercise helps, whether it be weight lifting or cardio. Mindfulness meditation also helps.

I have a vision in my head. A healthier me, by the end of 2019. I am going for it. Wish me luck, fellow ex-smokers.

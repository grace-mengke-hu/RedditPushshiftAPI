132 days as a non smoker here. "Heated discussions" with the loved one still makes me wanna smoke one in a single breath.

So hey, my story is simple .. smoker for 15 years  and finally i managed to quit last year. After 5 months started again :|. After a while a loved one managed to convince me to quit again, so here i am with this 132 days. 
I'm a person with a low self esteem so i wanted to do this thing for myself or at least that was the label but in fact i did it for him. Of course, now, every time we have a fight the urge comes back stronger and stronger. Makes me angry as hell in a way cause i know i have a long run with him and i don't want to disappoint him and also i don't want to start all over again but it's still frustrating. Do you guys and girls have any advice?! Thanks for reading me! Stay strong and smoke-free classy!

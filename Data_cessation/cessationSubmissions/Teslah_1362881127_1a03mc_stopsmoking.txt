Four

Today has been my fourth completely cigarette free day. It was absolutely beautiful outside and after smoking since I was 11 years old (now 20) I feel as if I have been missing out on enjoying nature and being physically able to be active in it. I am most looking forward to regaining my lung function. 

Something I've been wondering was if anyone had any tips to reduce my food cravings while quitting? One major thing keeping me from quitting has been my issues with my weight- I lost around 70 pounds and fear gaining weight as much as I fear death. 


All in all, **this time feels different**. :)

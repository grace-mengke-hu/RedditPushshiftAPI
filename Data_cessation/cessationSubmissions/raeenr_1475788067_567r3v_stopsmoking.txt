Argh! What can I do about being constantly hungry?

I'm three days in this time (I smoked for two years, then quit for two years, then had a two-month relapse), and I'm doing okay with the cravings, but I am just fucking starving all the time. I know it'll pass eventually, but I'd rather not gain a ton of weight in the process of quitting. What do you guys do without nicotine to suppress your appetite?

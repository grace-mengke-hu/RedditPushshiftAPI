Struggling today

It’s Day 10 and I thought I was done with the bad part, but am really struggling today. I am an emotional mess and experiencing intense cravings. My crazy mind is trying to tell me if I smoke just one cigarette I will feel much better. I know that’s not true. A little while ago I went a little crazy on my five year old for acting like a five year old. I want to stay quit, but I don’t want to be like this. My mind is also trying to tell me I need a cigarette so I don’t say/do anything I may regret. For now I just decided to go up to my room where I’m not near people. I plan on staying quit, but I feel like I should feel better by now. Thanks for listening.

Yuck. Having a rough day of it. Haven't smoked today, but Yuck!

Guys, Gals...


Anxiety in the pit of my stomach. General feeling of emptiness/missing something. My mind drifts to smoking on the porch, followed by, "Damn I quit."

I mean, I'm really glad I haven't caved but I'm just posting here to reach out to somebody with a thought or word of encouragement. 

Thanking you in advance. May we all prevail!

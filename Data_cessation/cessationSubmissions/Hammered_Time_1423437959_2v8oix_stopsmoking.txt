100 days!

So I'm very proud to say I made it this far. Even prouder to say I have no intentions of going back. For me quiting cigarettes has been the first of many steps in self improvement. Since I started my quit I have also began running around 4 miles a week, going to the gym 4 days a week, meditating daily, and have also stopped smoking weed for the past 35 days. To those just starting out keep going it is so worth it and only gets easier.

Can't stop eating!

I originally quit on 1st of January, cold turkey. 

Caved the 4th and bought a pack of 20 - then quit again on the 6th.

Had ONE smoke on the 19th due to being super drunk and stupid (I don't really feel it counts and it tasted like shit - felt super bad). But other than that, it's going pretty good.

I've smoked for more than 10 years before that, and was smoke free for about 9 months in 2017 (started dating a smoker, which was so stupid and it pulled me back in..)

Apart from all that, I feel like my main (and only) problem is right now is, that I eat a huge ammount of food. Almost twice as much as I used to. I'm constantly hungry, or at least I think I am. I drink loads of water, but I doesn't help.

How do I deal with these "food cravings"?

I don't remember them being this strong back in 2017. Please help!

Is now the time to quit?

I am going through one of the most stressful periods of my life and I have practically no free time for the next 2 months my go to to relieve stress when all this work is making me feel too overwhelmed is to smoke at the same time I want to quit so I am not sure if I should now or if considering my current situation this would be a bad move, but at the same time this could be my justification to keep smoking what do you guys think?

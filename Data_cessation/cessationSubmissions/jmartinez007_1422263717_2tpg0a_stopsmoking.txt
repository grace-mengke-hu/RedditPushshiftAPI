I still smoke but I want to stop. So I guess this is the first step?

I have been smoking for about a year off and on. I hate the way the cigarettes taste and smell and make me smell, but every time I try to quit, I go back to smoking. I know that it is bad for me and I think that is part of the problem, but that is a conversation saved for a more professional opinion. Almost all of my friends are disappointed in me smoking, and I do feel bad about that, but I just get so stressed out that I need a cigarette. I have quit before but whenever I get the urge it comes back. I love the feel of the nicotine coursing through my body. 

Any way, does any one have any tips on how to help me quit? which is better in everyone's opinion: quitting cold turkey or weening yourself off of the cigarette? 

I really want to make changes and this is one of the first that I want to take care of. :)

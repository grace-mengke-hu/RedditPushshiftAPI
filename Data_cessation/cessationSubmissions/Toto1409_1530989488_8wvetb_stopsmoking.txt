After 10 years of smoking and relapsing countless times, I came to a realization.

I've been lurking this subreddit for years now and when I attempt to quit smoking, I'll read/comment on some threads here. 

I'll be turning 30 next week and I have a very addictive personality. I usually need something that keeps me from being bored: cigarettes, alcohol 3-4x/week, etc. Recently, I've started to dread my hangovers from alcohol and the associated chain-smoking and decided I'd pick up smoking marijuana. On July 4th and under the influence of marijuana, I realized something. I asked myself, "10 years ago, how would I envision myself at 30? Who would I be at 30?" And I thought about this all night. I envisioned someone who was pretty healthy. Someone who liked to run or play tennis or go on hikes. Someone who didn't drink because they were bored or had a hard day at work and didn't waste away their weekend due to a debilitating hangover. And definitely someone who didn't SMOKE. SMOKING IS GROSS. 

 I realized my behavior and actions were not in line with my vision. I figured quitting all vices would be a HUGE mountain to climb, but the first step to achieving my vision would be to stop smoking and start exercising.

It's only been 3 days but THANK YOU GUYS for encouraging all of us who are still fighting this battle and reminding us that there is hope.

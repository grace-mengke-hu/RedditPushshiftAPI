Why i believe counting days since you quit is bad

Counting days since last cigarette could actually trigger a feeling of missing out.
quitting smoking is actually escaping the dreadful thing that smoking is.

a person who was released from prison doesn't think to himself ..
"Wow it's been a week I have been released", instead they celebrate the fact they were released and live life without looking back.

It might be a confidence boost to few people, a testimony to thier commitment to health and achievement. But in more cases it could seriously trigger the feeling of smoking again as they might feel confident "I have done it once, I can do it again". And they are trapped again.

Let me know what you think...

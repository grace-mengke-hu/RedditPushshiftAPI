Driving me mad

People keep telling me how proud they are of me and it's driving me mad, if only they could feel how I feel maybe they would just stop talking about it. I'm finding it so hard to stop smoking and it's not helping my husband has stopped at the same time so when I think I'm doing well he is having a bad day and I'm sure it's the same the other way around.

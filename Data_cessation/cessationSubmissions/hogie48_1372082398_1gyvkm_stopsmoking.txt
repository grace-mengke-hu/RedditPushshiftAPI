Resetting my badge after 423 days...

I think the title says it all, but I want to give a little back story.

423 Days is more than I actually did, but I forgot to reset my badge when I started smoking again so I don't know the exact number.  It is most likely somewhere around 300, it was less than 1 year.  

What happened?   I don't know honestly :(.  One day it was fine, the next day I was outside with a work friend talking while he smoked, and then the next day I had a pack.  It is a viscous habit that I can say to anyone who is looking to quit, or maybe just quit, that it does not get any easier.  Once you pass the 1 week mark, it is all will power and mind games.  Knowing your trigger's that make you want to smoke really helps as you can avoid them at all costs.  To me, drinking is a killer for a smoke.  I think I need to quit drinking completely if I want to not smoke anymore.  After 1 beer I will crave a smoke every 20 minutes if I continue to drink.

Well here it goes, starting at day 1 again.  I already submitted my new badge date, it doesn't look like its ready yet though.

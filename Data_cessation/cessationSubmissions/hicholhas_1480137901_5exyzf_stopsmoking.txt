'NO Bull Shit' - usually smells of Bull Shit...

We've all been told if something is to good to be true it usually is. However this cynicism prolonged me from making the greatest decision of my life. Reading Allen Carr's Easy Way! A family friend, pack-a-day smoker of 35+ years some how quit overnight. He told me it was because of this book... He gave it to me and I reluctantly accepted it. I smoked a 40 pack-a-day and genuinely thought nothing could help me to quit. Especially after I relapsed following major surgery on my sinuses. It took me almost a year before i picked up the book and finally read it. I finished it a week ago and haven't felt like a cigarette since. Im still in shock somewhat, that it actually worked... But it's a book written by smokers, for smokers. Everyone knows how painful it is to listen to a non-smoker tell you about smoking like they have a clue... There are no scare tactics, which i never responded to anyway and the greatest thing about it is you are encouraged to smoke while you read and strangely by the end of the book you are quite content with the fact you just put out your final ever cigarette. If your trying to quit and failing this might just do the trick! For those who cant be fucked reading, (I can sympathise) Heres a dvd rip on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVMyWN54x-U

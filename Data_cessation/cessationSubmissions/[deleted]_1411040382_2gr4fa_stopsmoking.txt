When will this cough end.....

Its driving me crazy. 

Im 21 years old and smoked anywhere from half a pack to a pack a day for the past 5 years. This is my first quit attempt, but I really think it'll work as Ive really had almost no cravings (I'm currently still reading Allen Carr book and I watched the youtube vid). I went through a horrible cold the first week, but now it just seems to be this lingering cough.

While I smoked, I never had a "smokers cough" or anything like that. Ive been extremely active since quitting, in the gym everyday doing cardio, and I think thats helped me a lot.

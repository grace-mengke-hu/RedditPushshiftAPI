Questions about people who have used an e-cig

So I've decided to try out an e cig to help me quit smoking. I plan on getting used to just using an e cig then winding down the nicotine content to 0% and then just stop using. I have a few questions about people who have done this. When you switched, full time, to an e cig did you notice a difference health wise? Did you notice your chest getting better? Did your sense of smell and taste improve while using the e cig? Did you notice any other positive effects and or negative effects of using the e cig?

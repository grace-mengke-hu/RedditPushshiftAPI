When does it get easier?

I haven't had a cigarette in 9 days and I still get pretty intense cravings. I've been actively trying to stop for the past few months and I've stopped smoking for 2-3 weeks before but right around that point I get fed up with the constant cravings and cave or something very frustrating happens in my life and I can't resist. I started smoking when I was 15-16 and I've gone through a pack every 2-3 days since then (I'm 20 now), so is quitting just going to suck that much more since I started while I was young? I'm entirely over smoking but I can't even focus in class or on my school work when I'm trying to quit and I need to keep my grades up. Any tips or advice is very much appreciated!

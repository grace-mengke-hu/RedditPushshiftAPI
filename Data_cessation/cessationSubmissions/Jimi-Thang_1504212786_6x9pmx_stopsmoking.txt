It gets easier!

I am at around 7 weeks without a cig. I haven't been coming here that much because it has gotten easier. I never thought I would make it this far. I wanted to come back and post that it does get easier. I was on this sub all day for the first few weeks. I never thought I would make it past a week, but I did. If you are just giving up the cancer sticks, know that it will get easier! I get cravings here and there, but they are just passing thoughts now. Just make up your mind to quit, and you can do it. It will get easier with each passing day. Sometimes I had to go minute by minute. I would tell myself that I could make it through the next five minutes without a cig. I did that enough times to make it a day. Then, a week had gone by. Next thing I knew, I was at a month. Just stick with it. If you fall down, get back up and keep going!!!

Smoke free mission for day 19

Yes that is 19 days smoke free!
My mission from smoke free today was to list all the things that are helping me stay smoke free so I thought I’d share them here!
Breathing exercises
Hobbies old and new
Stay busy
Long showers and brushing my teeth
Checking this app repeatedly
Reddit
Walking/exercise
Read a book while taking a bubble bath

I’m sure we can add more. Hope some of these might help you too

28 days smoke free, throat feels hoarse and lumpy

I have been a smoker for last 7 -8 years, smoking around 6 - 9 cigarettes per day. Finally I've stopped and my throat feels dry, and is hoarse, along with a lumpy feeling (like tonsillitis) which is more noticeable while drinking liquids. This is making my mind restless and I have to admit am a little scared too. Just wanted to vent here.

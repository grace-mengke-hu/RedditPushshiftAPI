One week smoke-free today!

Yesterday was my first day back at work after quitting. Another woman there talks about quitting a lot (first it was when she came back from holiday, then it was until her pack was empty multiple times (like weekly), then new years ect). She was shocked to find out I actually did it since Ive never talked about it or even hinted at wanting to stop. Hope she gets motivated and joins me.

Is it worth it to have THAT one cig?!

Okey, so after 10 days I lit one up. Haven't really red any post here about what it feels like, so I'm going to write it all out. 
First, I don't even know what led to it, but it leads back to 1 or 2 days, so stay on your toes!

Second: It was awful. Like really. I don't beat myself up very much, but man... I knew it will not be good, but it was horrible.
I consider this a slip, so I'm continueing my quitting. I regret it. 

So conclusion: if you think about lighting THAT one cig up, don't do it. Learn from my and I believe many others mistake (S).
I am positive I don't want any more of that, not going to be easy I know.

Cheers.

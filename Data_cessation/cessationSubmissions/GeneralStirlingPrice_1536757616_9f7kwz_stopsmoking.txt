Sudden urge to smoke after a month

It’s been 33 days. The headaches, sleepiness, night sweats and rage have all passed. I’ve been feeling fantastic and sometimes even forget about cigarettes altogether. 

But today. Oh. My. God. I don’t know why, but I am craving a cigarette worse than on day 3.  It’s painful and all consuming. 

I won’t smoke. But I don’t want to feel like this again. Anyone experience this? It will pass, right????

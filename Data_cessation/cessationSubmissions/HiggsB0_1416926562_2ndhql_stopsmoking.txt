Don't be afraid to get medical treatment for quitting!

I've tried to quit for over a year with the cold turkey method over 20 times and I just couldn't swing it. Like a lot of people, I tend to be wary of pills. Luckily (and I guess horribly when you look at it a certain way), my last cold turkey attempt resulted in suicidal depression. I say luckily because it sent me to a psychiatrist who gave me what I needed. 

I was prescribed Wellbutrin for the depression and withdrawls, the patch for quitting, and therapy for adjusting to my new lifestyle. It has made SUCH a difference. I just kept smoking at first, but on day 6, cigarettes just didn't have a kick anymore. Smoking for the first time in my life, wasn't enjoyable. I started the patch right after this happened and I couldn't be happier. I actually had fun with my 16 year old brother and wasn't thinking about smoking the whole time. That is life changing to me. 

So cold turkey, while effective for most, is just not gonna cut it for some of us. So don't be afraid to seek treatment. They really want to help you quit, and they will! 

Edit: Oh neat, it's my cake day. What a wonderful thing to be posting about on such a day.

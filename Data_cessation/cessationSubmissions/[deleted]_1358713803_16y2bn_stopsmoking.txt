The triple terror three are gone (Day 4 now)

Regardless of what my medal says, I am now 3 days past smoking. I am starting day 4 and man, it hasn't been that easy. It hasn't been hard, but it hasn't been easy either. I got it into my head that cigarettes are providing no benefit for me, but its been weird.

The most notable thing I am running into is trying to stop a habit and not replace it with anything. It's weird getting flash backs whenever I do something related to smoking, like driving for instance. I guess I got the PTSD. 

My memory is playing tricks on me, and it's not the feeling I miss really, it's the... habit itself. Filling that pit instead of replacing it is kinda annoying on the mind. 

I haven't really drank alcohol yet because that is the only trigger craving I am afraid of. It is the only one that I have yet to face, and damn... I am kinda wondering if I should wait 3 weeks, any have any similar experience like mine?

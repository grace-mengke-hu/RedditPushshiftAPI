72 Days QUIT

I hardly ever think about having a cigarette anymore. NYE resolution that stuck! I feel so much better now. Breathing easier; less heartburn; no stink; no mess with cig butts and ashes. If you are ready to quit you will do so and this group can help. You must make the decision to though. No 'try' to it. Once you decide to become a non-smoker..."own it" and don't look back.

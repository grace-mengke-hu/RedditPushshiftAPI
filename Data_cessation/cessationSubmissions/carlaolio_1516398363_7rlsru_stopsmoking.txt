Started Zyban 4 days ago..

And I have just woken up with severe anxiety. My mood has also been very low and I have been crying at the drop of a hat which is very unusual for me. I am still smoking but not enjoying them as much. 

Anyone else had similar effects and stuck it out and reached success?

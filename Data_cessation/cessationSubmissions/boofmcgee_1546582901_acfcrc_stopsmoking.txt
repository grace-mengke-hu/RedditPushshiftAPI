Time to quit?

I've been lurking for a while, because I do want to quit but I feel like I'm not ready yet. (Ive quit before several times and thought Id kicked it for good last time but then I turned 21 and alcohol and cigs was just such a good pair and my closest companions all smoke a ton...) It's always "one more pack" or "I'll quit soon". Well I've had a really bad cold and as a result haven't had a cigarette in several days because I want to be able to breathe without coughing so bad I vomit more than I want that sweet sweet smoke. But at the same time Im really really wanting to finish my pack when I get better. I know I shouldn't. I'm so impressed and envious when I see all of your amazing progress updates here. So my question to you all is, what was it you told yourself to finally solidify the decision to stop? Or what else helped motivate you?

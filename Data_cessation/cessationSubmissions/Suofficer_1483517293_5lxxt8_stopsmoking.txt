Two years ago today I stopped smoking. If i can do it you can do it.

I started smoking at 14, a few a day. By 18yrs old a pack a day, by early 30s 9-10 packs a week. On January 4th 2015 at 10 pm I had my last smoke. I went cold turkey, the first month or two were hell, but my life is so so much better for no longer being a smoker. 

How I look, smell, perform in the gym and in bed are just some of the benefits of quitting. This sub helped me a lot, i would check in and peoples desire to quit and their stories helped me. So Thank you! 

Its the hardest thing I've ever done, but its doable. 

Quit today!

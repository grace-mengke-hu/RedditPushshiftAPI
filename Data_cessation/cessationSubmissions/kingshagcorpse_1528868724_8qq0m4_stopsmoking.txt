Quitting drinking was easy for me. Why are cigarettes so difficult?

I was never a problem drinker, granted, but now that I've stopped I rarely ever get cravings (I still drink occasionally, but it's more like once every three months or so rather than twice a week). Why is this so hard? I didn't start until I was 27! Any advice is appreciated!

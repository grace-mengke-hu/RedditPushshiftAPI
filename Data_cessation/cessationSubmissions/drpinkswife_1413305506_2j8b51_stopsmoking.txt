So Annoyed Sometimes By Smokers.

So I found this wool I bought in Scotland a few years ago back when I was smoking. I unravelled it and made a scarf last week. I washed it carefully, due it being stored in my old place and in boxes and my having worked with it whilst smoking.

It looks TWO DAYS to dry. First day I wore it I had to take a taxi. The rule at the taxi rank is you have to take the next available taxi. Even if you don't like vans, which I don't, I prefer cars. I got in the taxi and the dude quickly put out the smoke which be was puffing on with the windows up.

My new scarf needs to be washed again. So annoying!!!

So glad not to be smoking.

I apologised to a non-smoking friend the other day for being insensitive around her regarding cigarette smoke and the smell. You really have no idea when you are smoking how foul it is!

I just finished reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

I snubbed out my final cigarette. I can't wholly say it was in confidence. But I'm feeling a bit under the weather right now so I didn't want to smoke it anyways. Although that was DEFINITELY coupled with the messages sent from the book. I took the remainder of my pack and broke them up and threw them away. I want to say I'm a non-smoker and I would like to request a badge. 

The only questions I have is for people who quit using this book, How was it? I've failed cold turkey before but I just want it to be done! I've been smoking for 9 years. I just feel like I'm cheating by saying I'm a non-smoker (even though the book instructs you to have that attitude). Whatever, I'm out of smokes and I don't care. I'm looking forward to everything lovely about quitting. I'd just like some feedback. Thanks!

I quit smoking and now I get antsy. Any recommendations for easing restlessness?

Hey everyone. I quit smoking. I'm a week without nicotine and most of the withdraw symptoms are gone. Barring some future drunken mistake, I consider myself an ex-smoker now.

I have one small problem: I still get restless with downtime when I'd usually smoke a cig. Between tv shows, after a gaming session, between beers, on my car ride home from work, etc. I get antsy without something to occupy my mind. Any advice for how to acclimate? Or any ideas for a replacement tick? Thanks!

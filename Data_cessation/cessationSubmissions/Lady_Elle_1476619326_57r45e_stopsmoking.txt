Time?

The only thing I'm noticing (day 2) is the amount of time I'm not spending with my smoking husband. He's outside having his morning coffee and 10 cigs and I'm in the house at the kitchen table on fucking reddit. Maybe I'm jealous. Maybe I'm craving. This will pass and I'll be fine. Think I'll go for a walk.

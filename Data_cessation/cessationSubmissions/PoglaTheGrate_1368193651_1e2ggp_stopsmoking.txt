Control. I now understand it, it is all about control

You can choose to not smoke, or you can choose to smoke.  The logical extension of that is that if you can choose to smoke, you can also choose to not smoke.

Where the power, and therefore the control, comes in however, is choosing to be addicted.  I can choose that I am addicted to nicotine.  I am, and possibly will always be addicted to nicotine.  I am, and possibly always will be addicted to the practise of putting a smoke in my mouth and lighting it up.

This is something that has been a part of my life (mostly) for 16 years or so.  This is something that will always be part of me.

If, however, I choose that I am addicted to smoking physically; if, however, I can choose to be addicted to smoking mentally, I now have control over that state.  Now I have control.   I'm still addicted, but I have control over what that addiction does to me every day that I make the choice to be addicted

I don't know if I'm making sense, but it was a big turning point... about when I lit up a smoke four days into quitting.  (I promptly put it out, but that isn't the point)

Last one.

I just smoked my last cigarette! It was a habit I never even wanted to start but it happened. I can't take back the last 5 years of damage I have done to my body but I can control the next years to come. I'm gonna be 22 I don't want to continue to cough the way I do every morning, become short of breath as quickly as I do. My boyfriend is trying to quit by going down the e-cig road, I tried one and didn't like it. I'm gonna try to do it the way my mom did by sucking on a peppermint or something like a lifesaver if I ever want one or the way my sister did it by eating carrot sticks. Any advice?!

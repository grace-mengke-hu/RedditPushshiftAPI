11 days and my brain is trying to fool me

25y old, smoker for 5y, last year ~20 cig a day. 

Last summer I went cold turkey for 2 weeks, then on my birthday I took a celebration puff and soon after I started smoking again.

Now I'm reaching the same number of days and besides of cravings, I find myself thinking about smoking several times a day. I hope these feelings improve after the first month.

I've been offered shisha/hookah (with no-nicotine stones instead of tobacco). One part of me really wants to take it, but in the end, at least for me, it's trying to imitate smoking. Besides I've read in this group that most people who take shisha ends relapsing, and I don't want that for me.

Just wanted to share with you. Good luck and stay strong!

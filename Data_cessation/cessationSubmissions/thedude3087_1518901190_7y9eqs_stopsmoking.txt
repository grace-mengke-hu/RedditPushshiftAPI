Staying optimistic

Today I went to a birthday party (family of my partner). Got a craving, and went outside to get some air, and alone time... Some guy also went outside and talked to me for 5 minutes about why smoking is not an addiction... He did not stop, also when I really said that I was in the middle of a craving and not in the mood to talk about this subject... After a not so funny joke: he tried to light up my toothpick, my partner thought it was time to go. We went home, 2hours drive back, I raced home, ate something and went to bed... After 1 hour of sleep the nasty feeling was gone... I am happy this experience is over, I survived this unbelievable horrible craving! And I did not.kill the guy... Just wanted to share this experience with you guys. What do you guys/girls think about this? How can I protect myself from ignorant people?

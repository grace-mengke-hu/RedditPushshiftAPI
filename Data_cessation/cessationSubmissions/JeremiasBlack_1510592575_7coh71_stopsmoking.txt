How I quit: Understanding vices and virtue and the manifestation of your ideal self.

**What are vices?**


A vice is something that holds something firmly. For example, a metal vice that holds a piece of wood to a workbench while work is done on it. A vice is also something that is used in substitution for something else. For example, a vice-president. A vice is also a bad habit, such as smoking or drinking. Finally, a vice is something immoral or evil and is the antonym of virtue. All of these definitions are accurate when describing a vice such as smoking. For example, smoking is something that holds down your virtue, is a substitution for virtue, and is not virtuous. 


**What is virtue?**


Much like vice, virtue can be defined in multiple ways. Virtue was originally defined as virginity or chastity in women. Over time, this definition has evolved and taken on different forms. Virtue can be seen as a good or useful quality of something, similar to the way we use benefit, strength, or merit. We find virtue in people who stand up for their beliefs, we find virtue in people who take on the struggles of others, and we find virtue in those who are able to overcome their vices. Virtue is also a noun in that virtue is a behavior showing high moral standings.


**Why do we have vices?**


In my current understanding, vices are created and manifest when we are unwilling to make a sacrifice for future reward. We see this a lot in our current understanding of the individual and culture. How many times have you thought about how “kids today” are so focused on instant gratification and are using their time unwisely? This is the definition of a vice, the inability to sacrifice their current happiness in order to live up to their potential as a human being. They are substituting virtue for vice. There is hard evidence of this as well. When you look at the use of the words virtue and vice over time – using google trends – you find that since the 1800s virtue and vice have been used less and less. As individuals, and therefore as a people, we have forgotten how to sacrifice and it is going to get worse before it gets better.


**Why is it difficult to overcome vices for some, but not for others?**


This is a difficult question to answer, primarily because the only hard line I can find that separates these individuals is choice. Prior smokers and current smokers will often use the same types of arguments and justifications for why they smoke. For example, they understand that they have this vice and that their life would be better if they no longer partook in the action. They will often say that they are not addicted and they can quit at any time, they just don’t *want* to quit right now. The only difference I can find is that prior smokers simply chose to quit. Upon understanding this, I began to meditate on my vice and think about why I smoke, and why I didn’t want to quit. Understanding that my vice had a hold on me was the first step to kicking the habit for good. This is why many programs for quitting smoking or other vices start with admitting you have a problem. However, where I think some of these programs are inefficient is that they often leave people with the idea that their vice is controlling their actions. It is important to not forget that you are still in control, that you are the one that is choosing your current path, and to not blame the vice itself for your indiscretions but instead to blame yourself and lack of virtue. 


**How do I overcome my vice?**


I cannot speak for everyone, but what worked for me was a shift in mentality. I was under the assumption that I was strong enough to quit whenever I wanted. However, every time I tried, I ended up failing miserably. Even when I quit for a relatively substantial period of time – 4 months – I ended up right back where I began. What I understood about myself after long periods of reflection was that if I could truly quit whenever I wanted, then I would have quit already. I found that it wasn’t that I could quit whenever I wanted, it was that I wished to be able to quit whenever I wanted. Another way of describing this is that I didn’t necessarily *want to quit*, but I wanted to be the *type of person* who *could* quit. I was currently substituting my own future-self and virtue for a cigarette, and was refusing to step into the unknown territory of standing up for my own ideals. I was refusing to become who I wanted to be. I was refusing virtue. This realization was enough to motivate me. I had no qualms about how difficult this process would be as I would not just be fighting a mental battle, but a physical one as well. I would have to deal with cravings and physiological changes just as much as I would have to maintain my will to be virtuous and become who I want to be.

**Why should I even try?**


This is the hardest question to answer of all, because from my experience it requires a fundamental shift in how you view yourself, and in extension, how you view *everything*. You can easily find logical reasons to quit your vice such as physical and mental health benefits and pride in what you can accomplish, but I don’t think those are sufficient for most people – at least they weren’t sufficient for me. My reason for why I should care came in the form of YouTube videos of a Canadian professor, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. Jordan Peterson spoke to a part of me that was relatively undeveloped. He spoke to a part of me that laid dormant for most of my life, he spoke to the part of me that craved *meaning*. Meaning is not an easy thing to understand, and for that reason it is nigh-impossible to cultivate. Dr. Peterson had a way of articulating meaning in a way that I could not simply disregard. In fact, some of the things he said would shake me to my core. During these sessions, I would pause his lectures and struggle to reform my understanding of myself and of meaning. Over time, it became easier to integrate the information without having a mini-existential crisis. What I came to find was that humans are capable of greatness; they are capable of great goods and great evils. When you understand that you as an individual are capable of committing crimes or genocide it is a very liberating experience. You liberate yourself from following things blindly and begin to understand yourself at a level you would never have thought possible. It is a terrifying exercise going into the depths of your own evil, but when you emerge you have a better sense of your own virtue and morality. I highly recommend watching his videos and lectures. The ones that stuck with me the most were his appearances on Joe Rogan’s podcast as well as his lectures on his book Maps of Meaning. Once I understood myself and who I could be - both in the positive direction and negative direction, the question of why should I even try to quit was irrelevant. I was going to quit, and that’s that.

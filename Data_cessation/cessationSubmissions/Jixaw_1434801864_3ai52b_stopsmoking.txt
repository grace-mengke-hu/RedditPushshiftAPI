Well, i got to 109 days on my first try. Time to reset now

Hey everyone, it's no big drama or anything, but i'd just like to share that i'm resetting my badge.

I bought a pack yesterday evening and smoked some at a party. I don't feel too bad about it, neither do i want more. but i gotta be honest with myself. So i'll be resetting my badge. I'm gonna be careful the next couple of weeks, because i know that once i smoke another one, i'm addicted for life. I got rid of the pack i bought that night. so i should be good.

Let's not smoke today!

Its been 7 days today and I feel like shit

I've [stopped](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2hzsz4/day_3_and_im_going_strong/) [smoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2dgnqd/im_going_cold_turkey_todayfor_the_20th_time/) before but I've always given in to temptation. This time it feels different, this time I feel strong. I'm using nicotine gum (Nicotex 4mg) and it is working really well. I haven't touched a cigarette in a week and I don't think I will ever again. I don't wake up with a shit taste in my mouth every morning, and climbing up the stairs doesn't feel like a task anymore, and maybe this is just my mind playing tricks, but my skin feels better as well. On the other hand I'm grumpy all the time, I have mood swings, and I have this feeling of dissatisfaction inside of me. I feel like eating or drinking something but I the sight of food has become repulsive. I want to work but I get a headache as soon as I look at a computer screen. I'm anxious and shifty and I don't know how much more of this I can take :(

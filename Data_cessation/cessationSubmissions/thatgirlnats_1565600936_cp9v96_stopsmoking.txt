Anxiety and smoking

I have tried to quit a few times in the past year, the first attempt I lasted 3 months but then suffered a very bad anxiety attack. The 2nd time 4 days again had an anxiety attack and thought that having a cigarette would relieve it and the 3rd time I lasted 2 days. I am now giving up again and this is my first day. Does anyone have advice on how to reduce the craving during being anxious or is anxiety a withdrawal symptom?

I just realized that it has been more than 6000 days (WOOHOO!)

...since I smoked my last cigarette and I thought I’d celebrate by sharing how I quit smoking (after decades of smoking and many failed attempts to quit):

**Rule #1: Commit.** 

I failed umpteen times, until I decided that I wanted to quit and wanted to quit badly enough to make whatever changes in myself and my life I needed to make. There’s some truth to the idea that you haven’t failed when you relapse, only if you don’t try again, but it helped to remind myself that relapse didn’t count as succeeding, either. If you expect to stop smoking you must stop making excuses and stop accepting failure and start demanding better from yourself. Be *determined.* Do *whatever it takes*. 

**Rule #2: Avoid temptation and opportunity.**

I removed the triggers from my life. All of them. That started with throwing away cigarettes and lighters and ashtrays (really - nobody smokes in my house so what do I need ashtrays for) but included avoiding habits and people and places that might make me want to smoke. I couldn’t give up my morning cup of coffee, so I moved it from sitting at the table to standing at the kitchen sink. Smoker friends had to become tele-buddies for awhile. I cleaned out the car, including washing every inch of the interior and scrubbing the carpets to remove the smell. I washed the walls and carpets at home. I laundered the all the coats and jackets in the closet. I stopped drinking (even at home) for awhile and I stayed out of bars and saloons for a long time. I pretty much gave up sitting on the couch watching television. Identify your triggers and avoid them. 

**Rule #3: Use the crutches.**

If it works, cold turkey is great but it doesn’t work very often. BTDT. Toughing it out on your own isn't a sign of strength, it's a sign of boneheadedness. It requires more strength to admit your weaknesses and to make use of every tool you can put your hands on to improve your odds of succeeding. Tell your friends and family that you’re quitting and let them know that you need their help and what they can do. Then expect them to and dump any of them that aren't supportive. I hated the sick dreams the drugs gave me, but I took them. I disliked most of the people in group therapy and hated the embarrassment, but I went. To this day I’m not certain that group wasn’t more negative reinforcement than positive (the thought that falling off the wagon meant I would have to spend even more time in group was…horrifying) but it didn’t matter because Rule #1.

**Rule #4: Exercise daily.**

It didn’t take a lot but a little sweat *every day* really helped. I hate ‘exercising’ but I like to play so a bike ride or a swim or a game of softball or wrassling on the floor with the kids or…go to the gym as a last resort. Feeling my strength and stamina and flexibility increase made quitting a pleasure. I bought a speed bag and a heavy bag and took my frustrations and anxiety out on them regularly. I have *three* bikes and the only rationalization I need for them is that they helped me quit. Hatha classes were great for exercise and calming and I also learned that “namaste” means, “My kundalini likes your see-through yoga pants.” Exercising also took up time that might otherwise have been spent fidgeting and thinking about smoking. 

**Rule #5: Keep a diary.**

I thought of it as a log (much manlier than a diary) but it amounted to the same thing. I kept track of the days, I wrote down what triggers I had faced and how I avoided them, I logged my exercising and weight, I wrote about how I felt emotionally and physically, etc. I talked about why I was quitting and how the battle was going. I also tried to be positive and upbeat and reinforcing. I didn’t hide the diary but left it on the kitchen table so that anyone and everyone (especially myself) could read it at any time.

**Rule #6: Open a bank account.**

I opened a special Smoke Free Fund account at the bank and put the money I would have spent on smoking in it. Initially I moved money every day as part of my positive reinforcement plan and all these years later I still do it once a week. It’s amazing how fast the money piles up – these days, what with cigarette taxes and inflation, I’m setting aside $100 per week/$5200 per year. Spending that money on fun stuff instead of killing myself is a terrific positive reinforcement. Over the years, I’ve paid for fancy dinners and tickets to events and vacations from my Smoke Free Fund and every time I do it’s a little celebration.

**Rule #7: You will always be a smoker.**

Like alcoholics, who will always be alcoholics even if they don’t drink, it’s important to understand that you will always be a smoker even if you don’t smoke. Yeah, this sucks but it’s true. Smoking is a complex physical and emotional addiction that your body will always remember and the first step to a relapse is to let yourself think that relapse isn’t possible. It has been many years since I quit and the urges are far less severe and come far less often than they did but they do come every now and then – and fighting them off requires never letting myself think that relapse can’t happen to me and accepting that I’m just the sort of idiot who might.

**Rule #8: Always cherish Valentine’s Day.**

Setting goals and counting your victories and milestones makes quitting easier. I quit on February 14, 2002, Saint Valentine's Day. I told myself that I was quitting for love, as a gift to my wife and the love of my life (same person), but it’s a gift that has done far more for me than her. Still, I am thankful for the excuse it gave me to put tobacco out of my life for good and will always remember the day. At first, I rejoiced at each day without a smoke, then I counted weeks, then months, and now years. Aside from my annual Valentine's Day celebration, I'm looking forward to April 2021 when I'll pass my 7000 day mark. 

**Rule #9: Help others quit.**

This is a rule that I didn't add until I had been smoke free for a couple of years - at first my focus was largely internal. It was hard to quit. Really hard. Indeed, it took many attempts and many years to get to a point where I don’t think about it every day. Helping and encouraging people going through the quit process is a small thing I can do to pay the help I got forward. Besides, my karma can use all the help it can get and helping others quit helps me to remember just how much work it was. Hopefully, you’ll find some value in this share. Whatever you do, as the saying goes, just do it – being smoke-free is worth the effort.

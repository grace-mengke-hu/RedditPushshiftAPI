Advice about my exact quit date

So I just noticed my badge says 1001 days! Which is wonderful, but I feel it might be misleading, so I want your advice...

1001 days ago I quit smoking cigarettes successfully, *but* after two days of cold turkey I switched to eCigs. So for almost 3 years I've been vaping, but not smoking (with a couple of exceptions, pretty much only when I drank) and it was great, I felt healthier and my doctor was surprised by how much my lung health recovered. 

Anyway, 3 weeks ago (17 April) I quit eCigs, too. I'm using gum to wean myself off of nicotine altogether. However on the 19th I smoked a few real cigarettes at a drinking party for work (smoking is still allowed inside most restaurants in Japan, so it was very easy to relapse).

lesson learned, drinking is a real trigger (although I don't really have any urges while sober, which is nice.)

My question, though: What should I consider my "quit date"?

-1001 days ago, when I stopped smoking cigarettes

-17 April when I quit eCigs

-19 April when I had a small relapse


Thanks in advance for your opinions and advice!

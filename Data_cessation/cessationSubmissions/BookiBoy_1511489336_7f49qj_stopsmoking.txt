Approaching 3rd week of being Smoke free

As of tomorrow morning, It will be 3 weeks since I have had a dirty cig.

Been feeling pretty good, started exercising again (man im unfit as fk)

But one thing I am wondering now, is I have developed a bit of a cough since quitting. The only times I cough is when I am trying to clear out some phlegm.

I assume this is normal and part of the quitting process, and have read it can last up to 6 weeks.

I smoked for 10 years.

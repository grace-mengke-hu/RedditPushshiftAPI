Once You Go Long Enough Without Smoking, Do You Ever Smoke Socially?

What's up guys, I recently stopped using nicotine. I was up to about a Juul pod a day (for roughly 6 months) and sorta just figured I gotta stop this shit eventually.   


I really didn't find the quitting process that hard. Don't get me wrong, I can see how for some people it would suck and I got all of the symptoms but I just told myself not to be a pussy. It's now three days later and I'm still getting some cravings but feel like I beat the worst of it. My only question is if I rip my buddies' Juul once or twice during a night out, am I going to have to go through the whole WD phase all over again? The cloudy head phase suuuucked.

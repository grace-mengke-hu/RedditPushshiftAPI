How to be around smokers without being triggered

I am three months clean and while these past three months haven’t been easy it seems like all of a sudden my addiction is rearing it’s ugly head again. I have been avoiding my smoker friends because I don’t trust myself around cigarettes at all. I am very weak willed and I know that I will smoke again given the chance. A few days ago I had to be around them and it was so triggering and I was terrified that I was going to stop for a pack on the way home but somehow managed to stay strong. I am going to have to spend a lot of time with smokers this summer and I honestly have no idea how I am going to resist starting up again.

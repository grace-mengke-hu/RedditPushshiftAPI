Got a sinus infection, today is my first official day being an ex-smoker

It was probably one of the worst illnesses I had in my life - my entire body ached, i had chills for a half hour followed by sweats, my head was on fire, and it hurt to look up. At four am last monday morning, I awoke thinking I had to vomit, and after four tries - nothing. I could not even make it back to my bed at that point, I fainted and fell hard on my wooden floor, waking back up scared and dizzy. I awoke at 8:45 for work, still nauseous, dizzy, and scared. Luckily, two dayquil helped me to at least get through the day. I spent the next two days mostly sleeping and completely fatigued. 

I tried to google my symptoms and knew it was sinus related. One of the causes? Smoking. The mere three cigarettes I was smoking a day were completely not worth it. I had to find other ways to relieve stress besides this. So here I am. I know cold turkey isnt easy and work will be harder to get through, but it has to be done.

My boyfriend (smoker of 2 yrs or so) is having trouble quitting. How can I help?

My boyfriend has been smoking for a couple of years. He mentioned offhandedly that he was going to quit back in April -- so I held him to it. At the beginning of June, he moved over to SNUS because he says a big part of it is both the oral fixation and that he enjoys and craves the almost burning sensation he gets in his lungs from smoking. So the SNUS would fulfill at least the oral fixation part.

He had success moving over to SNUS and stopping with cigarettes, but attempted to stop using SNUS about a month ago. He quickly relapsed and started smoking cigarettes again without telling me. I confronted him about it, and he admitted that he was just not 100% behind quitting, so he struggled with it. He said SNUS did not give him that "burning" feeling. He is not very good at dealing with stress, and cigarettes are his coping mechanism. He is back to smoking 5-6 a day when he is home (on the weekends) and who knows how many during the week when he is working out of town.

I have tried to be as supportive as I can be. I didn't even show how upset I was when I discovered he had been lying to me about smoking, because I know that the shame would have just stressed him out more. But every time I see him smoke, it angers me and frustrates me. I lost my great grandfather to lung cancer.

Quitting again for (hopefully) the last time. Wish me luck!

Hello my fellow quitters! I've quit successfully for about a year before after reading easy way but after a bad break up I picked up this nasty habit again. It's crazy but at first I hated the taste, I gagged after the first draw but I kept at it and relearned my love for these filthy things. 

It's been two years since I picked it back up. I started again out of desperation and not caring about anything, I'm at point where I've turned my life around completely but the last thing left holding me back is my nicotine addiction. I'm not exactly ready to quit but I know there's never a "right" time. It's come to the point where I don't enjoy the taste or feeling of smoking anymore but I keep with it because I'm used to it and it's ingrained in my routine. I also found out at my last check up that I have dangerously high blood pressure for someone as young and fit as I am (mostly due to stress but I'm sure smoking hasn't helped at all).

A couple of things I'm not looking forward to, I remember last time I had an odd bout of depression and constipation in the first weeks even though I've never had much of a problem with either before. Advice on dealing with either of these problems would be great, I had no idea what I was getting myself into last time but I'd really like to face those things head in this time. And a little positivity to end with-my teeth and mouth already feel cleaner than ever! I never notice how gross my mouth feels until I quit for a few days and it's always a pleasant surprise! I guess I'm just looking for any positive words y'all can throw my way to help with the beginning of this journey :) I really want to do it right this time!

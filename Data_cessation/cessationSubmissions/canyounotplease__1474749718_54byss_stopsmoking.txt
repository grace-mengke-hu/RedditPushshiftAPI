Third attempt day one

Hi everyone. I was doing great for two weeks and unfortunately going home to see my family who I used to smoke around triggered me something fierce.

Stopped after five cigarettes for another week and then Friday I found out some of the worst news I've ever gotten. Went out and bought a pack. And then another. Smoked five out of that one and I don't feel any better. Just worse.

This is my third attempt now.  I am going to do this. Shit happens. I will get bad news again. I will be around my family again. I can't keep doing this every time it happens. I finished allen carr and I can't wait to feel better. 

It's not worth it guys! No matter how shitty the scenario. You will just feel worse, like me.

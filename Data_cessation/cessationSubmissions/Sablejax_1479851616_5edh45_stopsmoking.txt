First Day on Wellbutrin!

My badge is way off. After years of struggling I talked to my Doctor about Wellbutrin. Started today and already feel different and didn't really want to smoke my one cig when I woke up. Between the gym, focusing on my health and Wellbutrin hopefully this attempt sticks! I love hearing other Wellbutrin success stories so please share!

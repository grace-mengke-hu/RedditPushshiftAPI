I need some help..

Hey gang.

I've been having some horrific mental health for the past month. I feel terrible all around. I have also been off cigs for ~5 months. I'm starting to think I want to smoke again because I think it would make me feel better. I've read Allen Carr's book, so I know it won't. But it's an irrational feeling. Half of me wants to take that puff and half wants to preserve what I've accomplished.

Help.. :(

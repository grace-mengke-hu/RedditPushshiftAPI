It has been months since I quit -- and I still feel like shit.

Please help me. There is no solution that will get rid of the desire and obsession to smoke cigarettes for me. I quit cold turkey a couple of months ago and I am so close to picking up again. I haven't felt mentally well in weeks. I feel depressed, violently irritable, and frustrated. I'm uncomfortable and bored. I always feel lonely. You people lied when you said it'd be over in a couple of weeks.

Quitting with E-cigs

I'm going on 7 days now without a proper cigarette b/c I substituted with E-cigaretts (Blu Cigs). I'm pretty proud of myself! It was rough at first, as I was a pack a day smoker and the e-cigs hardly satisfy. 

Today is the first day I've had zero cravings, haven't even touched the e-cig and I'm feeling strong. 

I'm so happy I found this subreddit! 

Cheers!

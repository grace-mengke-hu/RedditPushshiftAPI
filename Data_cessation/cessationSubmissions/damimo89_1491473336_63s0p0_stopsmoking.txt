It's early days but going strong...

I was one of those typical smokers who had tried quitting smoking hundreds of times without success... used patches, inhalators, gum, e-cigarettes. You name it. But sheer lack of willpower never got me off the horrible things. I got to the stage where I knew I no longer wanted to smoke; it was killing me, aging me and costing me a fortune. I'd been smoking since 16 (now 28) so enough was enough.

I made the decision to go cold turkey... I wanted to prove to myself that I was strong enough to do it having failed so many times previously. I also knew that I had to make a big promise to others for me to succeed - I promised my entire family that I'd never smoke another cigarette or buy another packet. As much as I wanted to quit, I knew I wouldn't succeed if I did it only for myself. By promising my loved one and those most important to me, I knew I couldn't let them down.

And so it's been 4 whole days smoke free and feeling good. Day 2 was the hardest, became aware of my inner demon wanting me to smoke, trying to think of any excuse or way of backing out from my promise. The cravings have become less frequent and intense, just remember they'll pass.

Good luck to all who want to quit and who have quit already, keep at it. Whenever I struggle I just say to myself 'I have more respect for myself than to put myself into an early grave'. Grim reality.

Won't let stress ruin my one month streak

I've been dealing with some of the worst stress I've ever had, mostly finance related. I won't go into detail, but let's just say I'm not sure how I will pay next month's rent.
I've never been closer to relapse than I have been these past days. 

BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IN.

Do I want to be poor AND addicted again? Hell no. Even if I'm poor, I'll smell great, look great, taste and smell all the awesome smells this world has to offer, I'll continue to be able to excercise effortlessly.

I think about buying a pack every hour of the day, but then I think about how dirty and idiotic I will feel after smoking that first cigarette. 
One benefit of my dire financial situation? I can't even afford cigarettes, ha!

Keep going people, I believe in all of you! Thanks for being here.

Apps that help you cut down rather than immediate stop

Hey I'm looking to stop smoking but the apps I have looked at all seem to be instant stop, which I am no good at. 

Also I'm on Android, preferably an app with an account I can access both my phone and tablet. 

Thanks guys let's hope I can join the club, and that I don't get fat(ter) 

Edit: This app seems to be my Ideal (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kryptos.ciggie&hl=en_GB) but it is defunct! :(

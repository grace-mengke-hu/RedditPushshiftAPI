My goal is to be cigarette free by Halloween and nicotine free by my birthday, April 17

I've tried quitting a ton of times. I was totally cigarette free for about 2 years, but I still vaped. I even managed to go completely nicotine free for about 6 months at one point: I was living in a small town with one place to buy smokes and I do not drive, so I asked them to ban me from any nicotine purchases. I moved, got stressed at work, and broke HARD. I haven't been able to give it up since. I'm currently trying to cut down using gum and a vape. The vape just doesn't seem to do it for me anymore, but the gum seems to help a bit. 

I want to do it for myself. If I can quit smoking, I know that I DO have willpower and self-control. Plus it'll be easier to find a girlfriend, places to live, and I won't stink up my friends' cars just by riding. 

Wish me luck!

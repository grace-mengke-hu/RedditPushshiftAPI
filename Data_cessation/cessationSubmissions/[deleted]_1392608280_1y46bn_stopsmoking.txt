PSYCHOLOGICAL RELAPSE

So no, I haven't relapsed in actuality yet. But, my mind has rationalized it and I feel like I've already made up my mind i'm going to relapse. I just can't do it anymore. Week 4 is almost over and I'm still moody, angry and depressed all day long. Smoking and dipping is all I think about. I was with my whole family today and thought "GOD THEY ARE ALL SO DAMN ANNOYING!" I hardly talked to anyone. Even my little nephew was annoying me, which NEVER happens. I'm a horrible person without nicotine and I started smoking 7 years ago to self medicate my depression. Here I am 7 years later and I don't think I can ever stop. Help me.

About to hit the 30 days mark.

I'm on day 28.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess my body is quite confused after 10 years of non-stop smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

Good News: The yellow taints i had on a couple of my fingers seem to be gone. I didn't notice any big changes other than this one and the feeling of breathing smokeless air for such a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Bad news:  It doesn't get any easier. I still want to smoke. Every couple of days i have these thoughts of smoking just 1 cigarette to see how i feel about it. To know how much disgust or pleasure it'd give me. I know it's not a good idea, but i wanted to share.

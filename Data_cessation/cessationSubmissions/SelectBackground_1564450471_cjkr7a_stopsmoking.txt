Today Feels Different

Today I had my last cigarette. I had picked up smoking a little over two years ago when I was going through a rough patch, and have tried to quit endless times in the past year. I’ve had such an intense, complicated relationship with cigarettes. While I know others in this sub have had far more complex stories than mine, I just want to say I apprieciate this subreddit’s support of others, and for the confidence you inspire. Something about today *feels* different!

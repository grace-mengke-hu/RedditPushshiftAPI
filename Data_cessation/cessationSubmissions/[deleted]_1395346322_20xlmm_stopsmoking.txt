Horrible Canker Sores. Help?

So I got a horrible canker sore on day 4 right at the base of my gums on the front of my mouth. Didn't think it was related until I got two more in similar locations. Because they're on the front of my mouth, it hurts to even talk. 

How can I speed up getting rid of them?
How long will this happen for?
What can I do for the pain if they won't go away?

I keep telling myself at least it's not herpes. That shit stays with ya.

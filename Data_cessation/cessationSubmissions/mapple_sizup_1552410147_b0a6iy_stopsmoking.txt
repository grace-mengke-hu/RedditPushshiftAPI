Just turned 26 a week ago. Quit with Chantix? Advice and experiences!

Hey Everyone,

I’m really desperate to finally quit smoking. I’ve been smoking for 11 years and the longest I’ve quit is 7 months. I have no self control when I comes to smoking. And I’ve tried E-Cigarettes many times but I always find myself chain smoking due to convenience.

Currently, I’m smoking about a half pack a day. I’ve actually cut back; about 4 months ago I was at a pack a day. I really want to kick this habit but I always find myself reverting to some excuse (I.e. work, stress, “tomorrow’s the day”, etc.).

Has anyone used Chantix before? Has it worked? Other methods? I’ve used patches before and am considering going back. I know it boils down to willpower but I feel like I have none!

Thank you!

Day 1. Long term tips?

I'm confident I can make it through the short term (~3 weeks) but thats when things get tough for me. I have quit a bunch of times before and every time around 3-4 weeks in I start thinking "Its been a while since I had a cigarette. Maybe it wont be so bad if I have just one." and thats it. I start back up again. This is the first time when I'm quitting that I am aware of this cognitive fallacy of mine. Any tips?

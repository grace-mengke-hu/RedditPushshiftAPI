Day 45 and I think I'm going to buy a pack

Just found out that my custody court date has been pushed back another month. The court is trying to force me to send my son away again to live with his father for the next month many states away (14 hour one way drive). This is obviously going to be very bad for my son and myself for many reasons I won't get into here. I may end up going to jail because I don't intend on following the current temporary court order when Sept 1st comes.

I don't care that I've gone 45 days successfully. I don't care that having a cigarette won't really help me. I am just sick and tired of everything right now and I could just really use the comfort of habit that that piece of shit addiction provides. I actually hate being alive right now.

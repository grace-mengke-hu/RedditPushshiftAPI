Excess of self-confidence ?

Hi all ! 

So I've been quitting smoking for almost 4 days now, and so far it seems like the easiest attempt to me. I stopped all naturally, was really in the mood to stop, and the first 3 days flew by amazingly fast. I'm really confident I can stop longer than I did before.

But today (4th day of withdrawal) I've been really struggling with great difficulties, inner tension and laziness. I couldn't do anything even tho I have plenty of work to be done.

I was wondering if other people here felt that the "most difficult" part weren't the first three days but the few ones coming next - and if that's the case, do you have some advices to give ? 

This sub has always been of great help in the past when I attempted quitting and I'm sure it'll help this time as well.

Cheers and don't give up !!!

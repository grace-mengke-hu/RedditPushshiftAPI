I'm dumb

Well reddit I done fucked up. I am 15 years old and have been smoking a lot lately. I went through my last pack this morning. I just stole a pack from my mothers carton, she has caught me smoking before and does not approve, obviously. I've never stolen from her before and Im pretty sure she will know. Should I just own up to it tomorrow? I feel bad and know I need to not smoke. I think this is the smartest thing to do. Anyone else been in this dumb situation?

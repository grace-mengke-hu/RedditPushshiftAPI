Hey everyone, I'm on day 3 without a cigarette!

I was a 2 - 2.5 pack a day guy, and I'm on my third day without a cigarette. This is the longest I've ever gone without one since I started smoking 10 years ago.  I just discovered this sub and it seems like a positive place.  I've read through some posts and seen some good tips, thanks!

Edit:  Thanks everybody for your support.  I've just started day 4, and I feel great about it!

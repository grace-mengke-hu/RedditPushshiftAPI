Quit smoking buddies?

Hi everyone. My name is Shaun and I have smoked for 15 years. I have attempted to quit multiple times and so far am still a work in progress. 

Earlier today I came to the conclusion that I always try to quit alone. My GF isn't a smoker and the few smokers I do know aren't quitting at the moment.

So I was wondering if there was any other people out there in their first few days of quitting that would like to be my quit smoking buddies. Basically someone who could be messaged on here when having a bad day or whatever. I of course would be more than happy to be messaged by anyone who is having a bad day with it and wants to talk.

Anyway sorry for my rambling.

I don't know what to do..

I'm a 26 year old male (if it matters at all)

I guess the anonymity helps here on reddit. There is no way i could ever tell friends/family about this -  But, i have addictions to smoking, alcohol, porn, caffeine, and video games. This plays a big part (i assume) into my depression and anxiety problems. 

I would do anything to stop at a conscious level, and i frequently try to quit, but something always comes up (usually anxiety attacks) and then i end up binging aggressively on most of these addictions. 

I have tried everything to stop. Read through allan carr, and couldn't get through the first 3 days. 

I'm almost at a point where i feel like just giving up and accepting this hell. Maybe this is a cry for help, but i was wondering if anyone here had experience with multiple addictions, and how to deal with all of them at once. Or if maybe, dealing with one at a time is the best way to go about it. I sometimes think my addictions are a product of low self esteem, but to think there isn't a chemical element is crazy too. I just don't know how to go about it, and was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. 

Thanks

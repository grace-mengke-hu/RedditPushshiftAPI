I am 28 and I started smoking at 17. I want to quit.

I have quit several times with varying degrees of success and always something brings me back to it be it anxiety or high stress or stupidity on my part.

The farthest I made it was around a year and I was so stupid and thought that one cigarette couldn't hurt but before I knew it I was back to being a nearly pack a day man. I really want to quit and have it stick. I have heard vaping is a great way to do it but I'm lost on that front with all the talk about mods and coils and juice. I want to stop smoking and have it last but I'm just not sure how to go about it. Every time I have quit it's been a cold turkey approach.

Do you guys have any advice you'd be willing to share with me? I would appreciate it a lot.

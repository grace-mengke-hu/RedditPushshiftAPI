Just a little something I noticed...

I have not been here long, but I do know that the point of self-help is to offer encouragement and positive insight to others dealing with the same addictions. However, I notice that there will be the occasional post that will receive down votes. I understand that this is the internet and we got to take it with a grain of salt. Regardless, seeing down votes on a post in a self-improvement network can have the opposite effect than what the subreddit is intended for. I am personally proud of my accomplishment of getting this far without smoking and I hope to make it another week. I am also proud of my fellow redditors who quit before, simultaneously, and after. Quitting smoking is not easy, anyone can tell you that. This subreddit is an amazing outlet of positive and friendly people who understand exactly what we each are going through. This has been the most successful cessation I've had by far. But to see someone struggling or having a hard time and seeing those downvotes next to their post, it's like walking into an AA meeting and offering a shot to everyone there. Well, I for one am not going to take this "metaphorical shot". I'm stronger than that. I came here because I needed help and I don't plan on leaving until I feel 100% better. And I hate to break it to you all, but that might not be for a little while. :)

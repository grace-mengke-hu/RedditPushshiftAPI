17 days... I actually quit?

I've tried to quit a couple of times before, but I never really could get away from it.  This time though, I'm not sure why, maybe it was just a mental shift, but I started from day one with the attitude of "no, I don't smoke anymore, I quit."  I did patches for a few days, not even a week, and then I went off nicotine altogether.  I sort of surprised myself that I actually could do it.  When I feel the twinge to smoke now, I realize that it's just in my head, because I've been fine without it for more than two weeks now.  It's weird to be on this side of it, but I'm sure I won't go back.

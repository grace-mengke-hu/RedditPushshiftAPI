Thankful for the flu

A few days ago I caught the flu after a night of partying where I smoked a whole pack in just a few hours. I woke up the next morning with what I thought was a hangover that turned out to be the flu. By midday I had the headaches, the cough, the snot coming out of everywhere, and the fevers.

While trying to lay in bed and rest I got the nicotine urge. I said, "what the hell, I'll have one or even half of one." I went outside and lit up like so many other times. That first drag might as well have been molten lava I was inhaling, it burned my throat so bad. It tasted awful and amplified my headache. I put it out after just that one drag, went back to my room and in my anger and pain threw the nearly full box away. I'm definitely feeling better now flu-wise, but I feel different cigarette-wise.

I think going through those first few days without nicotine in the middle of flu symptoms masked the desire to smoke. During my illness, I've been around my roommate a few times while he had a cigarette, and the idea of lighting up then or at any time in the future never occurred to me.

It's definitely premature to declare victory, but the memory of that searing puff of smoke still lingers. I never thought I'd be grateful for the misery of having the flu.

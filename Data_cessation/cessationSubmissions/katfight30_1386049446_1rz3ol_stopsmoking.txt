Day 3-It's getting worse now...

I was off of work the last couple days and was running around like crazy so it was pretty manageable.  However, now I'm back to work and it's getting close to the time I would normally go for a cigarette.  To my advantage, I have no cigarettes and I work the midnight shift alone so I have no way to get cigarettes.  I really hope I can avoid going to buy them in 6 hours though.
I'm following the instructions from Allen Carr's book but the one thing that I do not yet agree with is the taste.  Maybe it's gross or maybe it's just because I've been a smoker for 10 years but I really miss the taste.  I am (was?) a menthol smoker and menthols smoke very differently than regulars.  You can feel it and it tastes completely different.

God I almost relapsed

I just went through an episode that literally lasted for two hours:I made myself believe that everybody hates me and that only a cigarette could save me. Im so happy I didnt relapse but oh my fucking god i almost lost the biggest battle of my life.
I really cant believe the power this shitty nicotine had over all of our brains

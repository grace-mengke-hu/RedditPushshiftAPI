E-Cig.. better than patches

So I went on patches three days ago. Irritated my skin as I already have Psoriasis, and they were 21mg each. Decided to go Cold Turkey over the weekend. Terrible headaches, and also messed up my meeting today morning. So I thought quitting smoking is not the only thing I have to do, I also have to keep my job. So decided to go a third directions. E-Cigarettes. Instead of 21 mg, I got a 18 mg one. I can feel that it has less nicotine that the amount I smoked or than the patches. I don't feel on the edge, but I feel that I am not getting the same amount of nicotine. Nevertheless, I am happy, focused, and technically smoke-free! Thoughts?

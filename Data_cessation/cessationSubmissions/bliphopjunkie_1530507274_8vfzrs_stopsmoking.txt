the other 'smoking'

This reddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to quit smoking. well I have got that motivation and I am on   
1 month and 24 days of no cigarettes. THAT IS GREAT. now as the description states I am gonna need some MORE help.

tomorrow morning I am gonna wake up and stop smoking marijuana. so for just about as long as smoking cigarette, I have been smoking weed for 30 plus years.  After stopping cigarettes, I have realized that I might also have an unhealthy connection to marijuana. So I am gonna stop that as well.  Anyone else have a similar path they have taken. stopping one then the other? this sub reddit is called stop smoking afterall. :)  WISH ME LUCK!

oh boy.

Out of curiosity, who here has not smoked any tobacco for the longest period of time?

I know from browsing the other boards that I see people that have quit alcohol for 25-30 years. Where are our guys with 70,000 day badges? 4,000 day badges? Okay 2,000 days? I think the biggest I have seen around here would be around 4,500 days. I want to hear if you guys still get cravings after all these years.

I remember when I used to smoke, an 80 year old gentleman told me he loved the smell of my smoke, but he had quit nearly half a century before.

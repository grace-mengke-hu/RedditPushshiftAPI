I want to stop but...

Hello everyone,

I'm a heavy smoker, have stopped here and there for quite long periods but I've always relapsed sooner or later.

So far it's been 15years (I'm 33 yo) since my first cigarette and I'm actually on a pack a day for the last year and a half.

I've managed to stop before : cold turkey for 1 1/2 year (got a gf), using patches (6 monthes) but I've always relapsed. I've read the Allan Care's book with no results.

I feel a bit desperate and I'm willing to stop again (money, health concerns). I'd like to give Chantix/champix a try but I'm scared of the depressive side of it.

If you have some advice I'd love to read it. Thanks in advance!

(feel free to correct me if something sounds too engrish :s )

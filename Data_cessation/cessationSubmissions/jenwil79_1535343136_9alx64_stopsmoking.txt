13 Days smoke free- still a struggle

This is day 13 for me without a cigarette. It’s really hard for me to find confidence until I’ve gotten to at least Day 16. I’ve tried to quit so many times and I never get past two weeks without going back. This time I’m telling myself it’s for good. I was wondering if anybody had any advice about NRT.  I’ve been feeling really on edge and sucking on nicotine lozenges like candy.

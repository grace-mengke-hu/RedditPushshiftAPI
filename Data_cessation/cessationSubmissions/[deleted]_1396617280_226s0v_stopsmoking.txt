How long after you quit did the excessive coughing go away?

Here I am, 5 months after i made the best decision of my life and quit smoking. I feel better overall, except I have this persistent cough and am coughing up phlegm. I was aware of this portion of quitting, because this means that the cilia in my lungs are growing back and my lungs can now function properly. I am coughing nonstop and bringing up phlegm occasionally. 

My question is, has anyone else had the same symptoms, and if yes, then for how long?

Struggling

So,  haven't posted in a while, been struggling last couple weeks, don't know why, nothing has really changed, besides the fact that the cravings are so intense lately, as if it was within my 1 week of quitting.  Don't know how to deal anymore. Don't know if it's because I am only taking the morning dose of chantix instead of both doses, but if I take night time dose then I can't sleep!  Don't know what to do anymore! !! Ready to throw in the towel for a bit and start all over!

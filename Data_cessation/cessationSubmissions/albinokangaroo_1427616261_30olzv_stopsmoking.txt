I haven't smoked for over 24 hours and I thought it would be much harder than it is.

I've started smoking at a really young age, I was 14. I am 23 now and it's been almost 10 years and I am finally getting rid of this nasty part of my life. As smoking has been with me for my entire adult life, I thought it would be really hard, especially the first days but it's day 2 now and it's not that bad.

At first I felt panic and anxiety for hours. But then I decided to not sit around and wait it out and cleaned everything until I was too exhausted to stand on my feet. It's day two and I feel better than yesterday. Craving is still there but I'm sure I want and need to quit and at least now I have no doubt in my mind that this is it. It's not my first attempt but it sure will be my last one.

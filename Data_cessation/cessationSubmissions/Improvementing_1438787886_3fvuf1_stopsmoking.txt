Excuses for why you smoked before you quit? Examples of "smoker logic"?

Here's some of mine:

My grandmother lived to be 95 and smoked her whole life.  

I don't have many bad habits, so what if I smoke 

I'll quit after (insert event)

I'll just smoke when I'm out having a drink. 

If I just stop smoking in my car I'll be able to quit

Tobacco is a plant, it's not like I'm smoking crack, jeez

I like the way smoke smells, stop making that face at me

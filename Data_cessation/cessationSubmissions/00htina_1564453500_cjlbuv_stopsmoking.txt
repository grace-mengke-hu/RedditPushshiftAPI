My timing wasn’t ideal but I’ve beat it

I quit smoking 12 days ago! I haven’t felt a real craving in a week. I’ve gone through the hardest shift at work I’ve ever had and I’ve been helping my family through an intervention for my alcoholic father in law without a craving! 

Thank you guys for being so helpful and being a great place to come to when I think about smoking.

Starting to regret the New Year Quit? Cravings taking a bite? Stay strong. Keep it up. It will get better.

I marked two years smoke free this 02JAN. I know the tug to toke up you are feeling right now. The rationalizations that maybe you're not quite ready and what is so special about New Years, anyway? Don't give up and don't give in.

You've made it this far. Keep going. Macbeth, Act 3:

I am in blood
Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er.

Or, more succinctly: The only way out is through.

I'm much happier and much healthier for the effort. And you will be, too. The thought of smoking is so rare now it is hardly worth mentioning, and easily pushed aside. Right now it must seem to crowd your mind, but it will fade. It will.

You are in a battle for the rest of your life. And so remember the words of Churchill when Britain's back was against the wall:

. . . never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never-in nothing, great or small, large or pettyâ€”never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.

Your enemy is the cigarette. A dishonorable foe indeed. Never give in.

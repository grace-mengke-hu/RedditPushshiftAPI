So today was my day

Hello /stopsmoking

So today was my day. I've been smoking for about 3-4 years. I've been building up to this day for a couple of months and I was really looking forward to this. To stop smoking, to stop this disgusting habit. I mean what good have it done for me? I feel tired, lazy and just really disgusting when I've smoked.

I've made the necessary preparations and thrown away my half smoked pack of cigarettes and all my lighters. I know I'm gonna need it since I don't want anything to remind me of smoking these first few days. 

I'm looking forward to the journey and I hope I can come to you for support because with my willpower I'm probably gonna need it! Haha.

Quitting smoking cigs and weed today, could use some inspiration

I started smoking pot when I was 17 and started smoking cigs a couple months after. That was five years ago and I have barely gone a day without both since. I'm realizing that I can't afford to smoke, both physically and financially, but the thought of not having that after work/drunk at the bar/hanging out outside cigarette is already stressing me out. I have tried to quit before but have never gone more than 2 weeks without a smoke. 

I used to smoke almost a pack a day but I'm down to 5 on a bad day, 2 on a good day. I tend to drink every day though and that makes things more difficult.

I'm only 22 and I don't want to set myself up for failure later in life. Can anyone recommend a day-by-day program or app to use? I know that motivation is my downfall and I'd like something or someone to keep me on track.

Anyway here's to day 1... wish me luck

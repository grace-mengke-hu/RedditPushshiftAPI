Doing it for the both of us

I just entered a relationship, and it's been the most magical Christmas ever. Today, I took my last cigarette. I've been wanting to stop for a while, and have been taking the steps towards it for a while. I've been at 2-4 cigs a day for a couple of months, but the fact that he doesn't smoke and dislikes it makes me want to stop completely. So today, when my pack went empty, after knowing for two packs that was the pack I was gonna use to quit (date was accidental) and setting my mind to it, I took my last cigarette. The last few weeks, they have tasted like crap, anyway. I hope I won't miss them.

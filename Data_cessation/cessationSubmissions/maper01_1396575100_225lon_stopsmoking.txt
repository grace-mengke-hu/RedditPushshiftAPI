10 days so far (after 27 years)

I'm 45 and have been smoking a package a day since I was 18. Stopped cold turkey ten days ago, and so far so good. I do miss it, of course. 

I did have some help, sadly. A couple of months ago I started having trouble breathing. I got scared but the x rays and other medical stuff was all right, at least to rule out dramatic causes. For now. 

So I did decide to quit, for like the fifth time in these 27 years. I managed to stop for 4 months ten years ago, but I started again. 

I have two teen daughters and a wife, and the three of them have been insisting on me quitting for like ever. The funny thing is that they have not yet realized that I have not smoked for the last ten days. 

One of the first things you read is that you should inform all people around you about your quitting decision. Specially those close to you. The reason I have not done this is that I have done it in the past, and failing is much worse when public. 

I am not feeling withdrawal symptoms, neither physical or mental. I think. What I do have is feeling that there is something else I should be doing to avoid relapsing. Any ideas would be highly appreciated. 

Thanks

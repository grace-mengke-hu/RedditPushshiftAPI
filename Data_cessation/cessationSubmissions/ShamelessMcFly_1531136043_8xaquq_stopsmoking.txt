1 Week off the smokes...

Today I'm 1 week off the smokes. I've been vaping for the entire time but on around 5mg of nicotine. For some reason, today I've started to get withdrawal symptoms. Have experienced no withdrawals all week! 

I was at band rehearsals last night and two members of the band smoke so could it be that I was around them when they were smoking? I didn't feel anything at the time. Like no desire to have one...

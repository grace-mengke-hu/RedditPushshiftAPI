Today was supposed to be the day I quit

But then of course I made the excuse that I wouldn't stop until I posted this on /r/stopsmoking.

So here goes. Any hints or tips that you guys think I could take with me on my quest to finally give it up? I've tried a few times in the past, but when I start thinking the cravings will never go away I get overwhelmed with the amount of effort it'll take to finally quit. 

What do you guys do to deal with the cravings? Some fundamental support and advice on how to go about quitting would be greatly appreciated.

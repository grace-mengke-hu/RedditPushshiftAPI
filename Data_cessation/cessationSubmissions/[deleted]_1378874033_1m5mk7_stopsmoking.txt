Wanted to post this here as well. (X-post from /r/nofap) And my badge should reset soon on this subreddit.

These past 4 weeks have been different obviously with PMO out of my life. Fapping is so easy to get addicted to. I mean since our puberty we have had a hand and genitalia on us 24/7/365. It's so easy to relapse having those two body parts always so close to each other.Being able to abstain from fapping has opened my eyes and awakened a part of my brain that has been dormant for god knows how long. A part that has a voice that says "no" when my urges come alive. If that voice is strong enough to stop me from rubbing one out what else am I capable of achieving? I'll tell you what it can do, it can stop me from killing myself with cigarettes.So as soon as I post this I am smoking my last cigarette. I know that with this new disciplinary voice I can achieve one of the worst addictions known to mankind. I will not say "I'm gonna try" what I'm gonna say is "I will quit" because I feel man enough to take that challenge head on and say to my nicotine addiction "It's time for you to leave".Thank you all for the awesome support. Because of this community my life is slowly but surely changing. I realized that I'm not only here to gain confidence with the opposite sex but to put that aspect aside until I cure myself from filthy habits.

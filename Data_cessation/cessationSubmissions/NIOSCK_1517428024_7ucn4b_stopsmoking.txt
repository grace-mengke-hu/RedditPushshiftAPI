Almost 3 months! I have some questions for other quitters.

So, first month no withdrawals. Just gone second month and I’m getting loads of gas with anything I eat as well as bloating. Also I haven’t gained any weight and I eat a lot. I’m watching what I eat, also using probiotic drinks. Has anyone been through this? Thanks.

I quit yesterday and it was awful. Today it feels easy. Will just keep getting easier or is it going to get worse?

So after 9 years I quit smoking yesterday. I smoked my last cigarette in my way to work and stepped inside with an ambitious attitude to never smoke one again. After an hour went by, my body noticed it was my time to light up another smoke. I craved one obviously, but also felt extreme emotions of anxiety, depression, and dread associated with the realization that I couldn't smoke one. These feeling lasted throughout the day and even led me to tears at some parts. After I had a nights " rest" (tossing and turning craving more nicotine) I woke up today feeling 100x better. I've only had  small cravings and despite co workers smoking around me I haven't felt very triggered. I actually am In a very energetic mood and feel very optimistic. But 
Y quitting app says that only 50% of the nicotine has left my body and I've read a lot of articles about how the hardest days are 2-3 days after, so I'm just wondering if my second day is EASIER than my first should this pattern continue and just keep getting easier or do I have even rougher days ahead of me??

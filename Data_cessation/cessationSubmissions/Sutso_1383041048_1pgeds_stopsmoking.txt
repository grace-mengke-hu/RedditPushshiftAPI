2nd quit attempt going well!

Hey guys,  
113 days in now. I started smoking when I was 13, then stopped when I was 17 until I was 21 and started again :(. 113 days ago I decided to do the 'impossible' again. I'm feeling great! I'm doing my workout 3 days / week and I don't miss cigarettes at all. Actually, I hate to sit around smokers because of the bad smell, ugh! This is just motivation for everyone around. Keep it going :) Also I saved 508,50â‚¬ which is around $700.

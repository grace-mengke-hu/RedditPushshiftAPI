how did you quit? share the knowledge people!

Okay, so research suggests most people "quit on their own". 

That means they didn't succeed using one of those ridiculous government programs you see online or advertised in the back of magazines.

 I mean the ONLY reason those programs exist is because tobacco taxes fund them...so I'll never believe they're honestly invested in helping me quit! 

But there are A LOT of quitters here, many of them silent. Too many. 

So I wanna know, and I think, everyone else does too...

1) HOW DID YOU QUIT?

2) HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU QUIT BEFORE IT "STUCK"? It's also known the #1 predictor of quit smoking success is the number of times you try to quit. It's all about persistence baby. 

So if you've succeeded after many failed attempts, I'd love to hear about the times you FAILED and then what ULTIMATELY led you to succeed....

Hey, it will make you human! And I need to believe I can do this. Humanity is what we share, yo,

3) LASTLY.....WHAT'S the BEST ADVICE you could give someone who wants to quit smoking? If you're gonna say the same SH^T that's all over the internet, don't bother! We know about cold turkey and the patch. What else? 

Like the guy who quit using shrooms. 

Or Lisa, from the Power of Habit, who quit smoking and went on to conquer the world and transform her life. 

Tell us something COOL so we wanna quit...

Motivated to START my quit journey today (for the 3rd time) and curious to hear from the successful non-smokers...what ULTIMATELY worked for you?

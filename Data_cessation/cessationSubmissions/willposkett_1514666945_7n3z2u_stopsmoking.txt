Almost failed...but made it!

Hi everyone,

Just want to give words of hope to anyone trying to quit out there. I haven't smoked in six days and it's been relatively easy. However...went out tonight and craved hard.

Pulled through and so much happier for it. It's probably obvious advice but self belief comes down to a lot it. Believe you can do this and anything is possible!

Also I would advise drinking (in a controlled environment) drinking asap to dissociate smoking and drinking.

Hope this helps in some small way

I had a craving yesterday and I crushed it! Not another puff!

We had a company meeting followed by a good buffet, and I binged on the food. I’ve been watching my calorie intake lately, and eating an extra plate on a Friday night wasn’t in my plans at all. So I felt awful afterwards. Dieting people will understand the guilt, like you’ve ruined a week worth of good work kind of feeling.

As I was walking home, I saw several smokers, and really felt like I want a drag too to calm down. I found myself considering buying a pack, because I had some leftover cash as well. I reached home without taking a detour to a shop, but was still overwhelmed with failure. On top of that, I couldn’t go for an exercise because it was supposed to be a recovery day.

So I decided to go out for a walk. Ended up doing about 13 kilometres (8 miles) in 4 hours, and that totally sorted my mind out.

Stay vigilant, and stay strong people! I am on my second month and wasn’t expecting a sucker punch like that. Don’t let your guard down and make the right choice when the temptation comes! Enjoy the smoke free life!

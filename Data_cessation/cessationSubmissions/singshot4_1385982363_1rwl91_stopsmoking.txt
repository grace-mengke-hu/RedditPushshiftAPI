Day 1!

may i say i had no intention of quitting untill i found this subreddit the other week, seeing everyone being really supportive of each other and congratulating each other is a sight for sore eyes on the internet. So far not  feeling any withdrawals. But reddit i may need your help in the next few days and weeks. Wish me luck! This is for you Grandad!  

Id really appreciate if you guys could share how you kept your hands busy and general distraction techniques

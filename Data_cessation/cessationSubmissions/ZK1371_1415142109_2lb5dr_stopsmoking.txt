Had my last one Sunday night!

Hey everyone, I've been smoking for about 10 years now. I was doing damn near two packs a day while I was in the Marines. I'm in college now and singing with a Barbershop group. I feel like I could sing a lot better without cigarettes. I'm here because I'm going insane and I want to punch a lot of things and people. How did you guys get through it?

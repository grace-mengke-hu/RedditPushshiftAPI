Never have I ever

Been so quick to notice how horrible a cigarette smelled. Yesterday, while enjoying some sangria, the wind carried the smoke of a cigarette inside the bar. It almost made me sick. I've quit a few times in the past. Never has it ever affected me the way it did yesterday. I guess this is just another sign I'm truly quitting for good this time. (8 days since my last cigarette)

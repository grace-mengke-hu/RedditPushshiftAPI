It's all in your head!

I've just come back from a night out and am still a day and a bit from 3 weeks without tobacco. I feel SO good about myself right now, and I have this subreddit to thank for showing me that I'm in control of my own lungs.

This is NOT like alcohol or opiates, no bad will come to me if I don't smoke. I do not have a chemical dependency on nicotine. All I have to do is remember that my prolonged, painful lung cancer-free existence is far more important to me than filling some perceived hole.

PLEASE, anyone starting out on this subreddit, don't treat this like 'just another attempt'. Your life will literally improve in the first few weeks, and I can honestly say that I am jam-packed with optimism about where this goes from here!

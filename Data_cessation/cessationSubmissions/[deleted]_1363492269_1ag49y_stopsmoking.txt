I wish my dad would stop smoking. How can I get him to want it for himself?

My dad is turning 44. He's been smoking since he was 15. Throughout my childhood he has tried numerous times to quit, but to no avail. My family doesn't have a lot of money, and is only now beginning to recover from serious debt. We've almost lost our house before. I know quitting wouldn't solve all of our financial problems, but just the little bit I'm sure would help. He has chronic cough, asthma, high cholesterol, and I'm sure some other things I'm unaware of. My mom also smokes too, but I mostly think she does because of him.

Now that I'm older I've become more aware of smoking and its toll on not only the human body, but also your finances and the concern it causes family members. I want him to stop smoking, but I'm too afraid of confronting him. Our relationship isn't always the best. There are many times where I'm afraid he'll have an asthma attack, or even a stroke or heart attack, while he's getting ready early in the morning or driving to work. It makes me afraid for the future.

I know the power to stop smoking comes from within, but how can I make him realize this for himself?

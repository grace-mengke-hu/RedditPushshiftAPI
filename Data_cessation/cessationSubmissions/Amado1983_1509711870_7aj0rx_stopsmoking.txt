Day 10, experiencing ulcers :(

Ok so on my 9th day i start to have 3 ulcers on my tongue and 2 in my inner lips. I rarely get those and past time i had them  many years ago. I have done research why i am having those and here is what i have found.

The researchers say that mouth ulcers may be caused by the loss of antibacterial properties of smoking while an increase in cold symptoms may be due to a loss of natural antibodies in the saliva.

Have anyone experienced ulcers after they quit smoking?

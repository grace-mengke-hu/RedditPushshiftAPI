Almost a month. Nightsweats and waking up often at night.

I do not feel like smoking a fag at all.
But I wake up often and it's been two nights this week that I've had night sweats. I also wake up quite often during the night to urinate, but that could be because I drink a lot more water than before.

Also, I still have some anxiety bouts here and there but I think they are weaker each time.

Just wanted to know if those nightsweats were normal or I'm dying.

thanks, and stay strong.

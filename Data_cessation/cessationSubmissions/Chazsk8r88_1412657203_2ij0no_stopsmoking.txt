Thank you it's been 8 days because of all of you

First things first, a huge thank you for everyone posting here. I have tried various ways of quitting before, patches, gum, cold turkey, and even Chantix. All of which were failures until I found all of you. 

On September 29th I had my last drag. I saw some amazing tips to get over the humps. The major one was a tip given when you have a ton of friends who smoke. "Not today, maybe tomorrow" has been a huge success and reading the comments about telling everyone around you that you're quitting so when the anger from withdraw happens that people know it's really not you. 

A few of the positives are my teeth are already getting whiter and I didn't even change my toothpaste. I can smell more things now, like the scent of fall leaves every where. I would like to say my pallet has grown too but as a busy person I normally Kirby my food by inhaling. I will try to slow down soon in that to see if I can taste and enjoy every flavor. 

The only negative side effect so far is it is tough for me to fall asleep at night but I believe that's more so a habit I need to break. I would have a smoke typically before bed. 

Again thank you all former smokers for your advice. For anyone else thinking of quitting, don't just read the post and a few comments. Read all of them. You will find the best way to quit that suits you from all the various ways people have previously prevailed.

3 year smoker - need advice!

Hi guys,
I’ve just joined this sub today after realising that I really do NOT want to be a smoker anymore.
I am a student (and therefore do not have lots of expendable income). I currently work in the service industry (where the only real break I get is if I go for a cigarette) but I am planning on leaving this soon and hopefully I am going to start working in a healthcare setting. 
I really want to quit before I finish college and before I start working in a hospital as I want to save money and also don’t want to be a smoker when working with people who are ill.
I have been smoking full time for just under 3 years and smoke about 10 cigarettes a day.. I’ve tried e cigarettes once before which worked when I was quitting with a friend, but I slipped up after 4 days and have been smoking ever since.
Any advice for me at all? Any app/book/nicotine replacement suggestions?
Thank you so much! The posts on this sub are honestly so inspiring, whether it’s been a day or a year - well done to everyone!

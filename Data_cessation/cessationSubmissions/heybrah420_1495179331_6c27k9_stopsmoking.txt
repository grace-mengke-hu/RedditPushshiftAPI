Does smoking hypnosis work?

Hey, just a question. I've quit smoking for the last month and a half but my girlfriend seems to be having issues quitting and has made me crave for one everytime I see her light up. She even tempts me with offers and gets upset when I decline (clearly wants me to stay hooked to make herself feel better), even though she claims to want to quit. Anyways a fellow co-worker told me his son went for smoking hypnosis and has quit for 3 months. Wondering you guys have had success with this method? I'm thinking of bringing my girlfriend to one. Thanks

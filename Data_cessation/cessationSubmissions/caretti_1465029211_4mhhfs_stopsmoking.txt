On a slippery slope. Not sure how to get off...

My first quit date was in August 2015. I smoked in October and reset. I've been smoking 2 or 3 cigarettes a day the days I'm with my smoking partner. I'm worried I'm starting again, but maybe not worried enough. After months smoke free I feel I can stop again anytime. Decide to every day but then don't. Anyone else been here? Can anybody scare or inspire me to stop properly again?

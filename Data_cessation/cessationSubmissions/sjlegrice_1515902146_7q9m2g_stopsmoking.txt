Ok, so today was tough! Day 13!!

I drove for an hour and usually I'll smoke about 2 cigs during that time, man, my lungs were screaming like mad!  I thought I was going to die from a craving!!  But guess what?!?  I pushed through it, it felt awesome to beat it!  And another triumph, you won't believe it!  After one hell of a craving driving an hour to and from my destination. I had a shot of liquor, and still didn't give in!  I'm sorry but after smoking 30 years and only being 13 days in, the craving I had for it today and knowing there is nothing like a cig when you're drinking, that's freaking amazing for me!  I just wanted to get this out so I can look back on it to see what I beat!  But now I want a celebratory cig, this is so crazy

Shitty quitters

I'm a resolutioner. This isn't my first time quitting. I'm determined to make it my last though. 
At the beginning of the year I did not want to quit smoking. I saw no point in it. I couldn't even fathom going a work day without my beloved smoke breaks. I got roped into a New Year resolution by my sister, and decided wtf I can do this shit. So, after days of cravings and no drinking I decide to have a few beers tonight. After about four my sister and her husband start to get ready for a smoke. A brief confrontation later everybody is posse at me and in the bed. 
I just feel like I put everything into something I didn't really want and just got shat on. Some word of encouragement would be nice. 
TL;DR I got a little pissy when my crew started smoking again.

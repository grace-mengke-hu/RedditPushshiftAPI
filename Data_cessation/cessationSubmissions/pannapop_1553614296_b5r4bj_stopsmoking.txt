After 6 years of smoking, I’m finally trying to give it up for good

I started when I was 16 and I’m now 22. I’ve decided to quit because I took a bad fall recently and broke a tooth which is going to have to be removed and then I need to pay for an expensive implant - and I want all of this healing to go well so I’m quitting smoking for good. It’s finally a wake up call for me, really, I’ve considered quitting for a while and now it feels like I finally have motivation. I think it’s going to be really difficult because a lot of my friends are smokers! 

I was smoking between 1-5 cigarettes a day (I’ve never been a heavy smoker) and then when drinking, I would be able to get through nearly 20 in a night. I really think my biggest stumbling block will be socialising situations involving drinking and being able to stay strong. I don’t particularly want to get an e-cigarette or vape to fill the gap either, so I’m going to have to do some research into techniques I can use. Main technique will just be avoiding drinking for quite a while I think, lol.

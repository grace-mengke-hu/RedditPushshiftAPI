Car rides while quitting are the worst...

I've found that blaring music and singing along, no matter how loud/obnoxious/off-key you are, REALLY helps. I thought car rides would be the hardest part, but I haven't even thought about stopping to buy a pack.

Keep trooping on my fellow /r/stopsmoking friends!

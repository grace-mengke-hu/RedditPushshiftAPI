Quitting. Anyone have any luck with state sponsored programs?

I live in Florida and they have a state sponsored program to help people quit. Not sure if other states have the same thing or not. Has anyone tried if so? Did it really help? They send you patches and/or gum and provide you access to online help and phone help via "quit coaches".

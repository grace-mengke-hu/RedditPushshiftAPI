1 week today and my head's fucked! HELP!

Ok this is getting really fucking weird. I've been good. 6 whole days. But today, it's all about the emotion and the "feeling" of smoking. It's craving which has NOTHING to do with nicotine. I honestly just want to "enjoy" a bloody cigarette. I know, I know... logically, I am doing everything right. Got the App, been logging my cravings, been very "aware" that this is nothing but just habitual. I'm so logically aware of "not another puff". But I'm still craving just a sweet, silent, stream of the smoke that goes through my mouth, my neck, all the way to my lungs and back out via my mouth and my nose. 

FUCK! 

I'm SO SO SO AWARE of everything but I can't seem to get over the fucking idea of just wanting to light up. 

I'm sure there are quite a few of you who have experienced this. Please.... tell me something unconventional to combat this?

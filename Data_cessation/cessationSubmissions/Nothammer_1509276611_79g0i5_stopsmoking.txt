Went to party, killed monthlong streak

So I went to a party yesterday and drank a lot. Unfortunately, this didn't help with the urge and I smoked two cigarettes. Back to the drawing board I guess.

But, to be honest, I don't really feel bad about it. I don't plan on buying cigs or have the urge right now. It was just a stupid mistake and I'll come back better and wiser than before!

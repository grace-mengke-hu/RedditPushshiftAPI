I had failed again. Went to the doctor. He recommended zyban. Does anyone have experience with zyban? What should I expect?

So I started lighting up again after about 3 days, like an idiot. I even managed to get myself a sinus infection. Man, those are fun!! When I went to the doctor, he recommended Zyban. He said its not as powerful as the chantix, which gave me horrible nightmares. Anyone have experience with Zyban?

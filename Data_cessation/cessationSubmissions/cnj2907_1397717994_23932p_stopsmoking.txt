Hi All, Pretty New here, looking for some motivation to quit. Details Inside.

Hi all, I have been a smoker for past 12 years. I took it up in my late teens. I am 30 now. 3 years back, I got Tuberculosis in my lungs. Even that Red Signal was not able to force me to quit. I smoke 7-10 cigarettes a day. Every night, I think of quitting and saying no to smoking but the next morning, it becomes "Not Today, I will try quitting tomorrow". I really want to stop it but somehow, I am not able to get rid of the habit.

I want tips on how to quit from this community, I have read a lot about on various websites but nothing has worked for me so far. :(

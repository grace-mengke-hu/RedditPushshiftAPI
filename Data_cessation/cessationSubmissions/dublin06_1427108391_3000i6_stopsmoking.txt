Vacation's over. Back to college, need some encouragement!

The last few weeks have been pretty stressful with exams and what not, however I've managed to make it through those. However, exams and vacations are done and I'm going to back to my version of 'normalcy'. I failed my quit the last time I went back to my normal life from vacation. Tell me it isn't worth failing now. Tell me I don't need those cigarettes to be social. Remind me how much my self confidence had suffered thanks to smoking. I'm glad I won't have to be self conscious when I walk into a room wondering if I smell like an ashtray!

I'm going to turn to coffee and tea when the cravings hit. I'm NOT going to leave the place when my buddies when they light up. I think it's important to go through these situations as any non-smoker would. I'm armed with all that I learnt from Allen Carr, so I'm hoping this time's gonna be different. 

Again, thanks a ton /r/stopsmoking

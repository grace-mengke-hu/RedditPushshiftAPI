I'm a newbie.

Just 10 days and I almost folded last night 
Rough day and I really wanted a cigarette.
I went to sleep early instead. 
I feel great this morning and my skin looks brighter so bonus. Lol
But sleep isn't always an option. Does this get easier? What do you do to get over the stress cravings?

Nearly 20 months since I quit, and I’m still discovering benefits.

So, I smoked for 38 years, since high school. Finally quit early last year, and have noticed all the benefits everyone does - extra money to spend on more important/fun things, no need to go outside (in rain/snow on occasion) at home or functions, not smelling like an ashtray and being self-conscious about it, etc. However, just this week I became aware of another reason to be glad I quit. A bunch of us (old school friends) are turning 55 next year, so we decided to go on a cruise to celebrate. We’ve had these get togethers fairly regularly over the years, but this time, for the first time, my first thought wasn’t “how am I going to be able to smoke without inconveniencing the others”. In the past, they all used to wait for me while I went outside to smoke, before catching a plane, etc (I was the only smoker). It was a great feeling to know that this time they won’t have to. I won’t have to scope out smoking areas on the ship. I’ll have more money to spend too. Love being a non-smoker. Thank you for reading. This sub was such a help to me in the early days, I like to come back occasionally when I have a ‘not-smoking moment’ in the hope that someone newly quit will read my post and know it is possible to stay quit, and reap the benefits.

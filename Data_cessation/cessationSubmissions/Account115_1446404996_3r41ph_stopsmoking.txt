I Slipped Up

tl;dr I Slipped Up and need help getting back on the wagon. It's hard because I moved from a nonsmoking environment to a smoking environment.

Up until yesterday, I hadn't bought a pack of cigarettes in 6 months. before that was about a year. I've had minor, one off episodes every few months where a friend offers me a cigarette and I stupidly take it but I've been a 99% nonsmoker for the past 2 years.

My problem though is that I moved home after graduate school and took a temp job to tide me by. A lot of my friends and neighbors back home are heavy smokers and my current employer sells tobacco. After about a month, I saw good quality smokes on sale at work and thought "why pass up on an opportunity to get a pack at next to no cost". I have since smoked 4 and I feel like shit. I'm a mild asthmatic and I can smell that my casual jacket is now tainted. 

it's harder to quit in this toxic environment. When I'm around my friends from college I won't smoke simply because, 1) I don't think about it unless I see someone I know smoking (which I hardly ever do) and 2) social pressure against it makes me try to hide any trace of it like it's meth.

I need tips on overcoming this key trigger without having to avoid my friends, neighbors and workplace.

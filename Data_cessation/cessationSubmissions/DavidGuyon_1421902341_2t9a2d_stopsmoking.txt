Random craving.

Very bizarre, but it's been 2.5 years since I quit and I haven't had a craving in about two years. I was in a gas station to get something to drink today and I was just gazing at the wall of smokes behind the counter...I WANTED ONE SO BAD, seriously, it stressed me out all day. I don't get it, I haven't felt the need to smoke in so long and for it to hit so hard today kind of freaked me out. Anyone else had that happen to them this far down the road?

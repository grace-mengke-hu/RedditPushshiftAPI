Impatient?

Does anyone else feel full of confidence about quitting? Feeling impatient to get to 3 months, 6.. a year?

Waiting for the revelation moment to pass and the real challenge to come.

20 years smoking. Quit 6 days ago but started vaping. Pushing to get to 0mg as quickly as possible. Day 7, 3mg e-liquid, 5ml a day. Feels a lot easier than cold turky

How many of you relapsed due to a false sense of security?

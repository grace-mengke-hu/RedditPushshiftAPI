Okay, I'll try it again.

I've quit smoking about 5 months ago, but after about 3 months later I started again - like before, up to 30 cigarettes per day.

I hope I'll do better this time, first I could use all that money way better, and second my health isn't that awesome at all, so I shouldn't make it worse.

Wish me luck, /r/stopsmoking

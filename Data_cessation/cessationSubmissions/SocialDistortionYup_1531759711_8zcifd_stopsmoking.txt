Brain fog / derealization??

I so want this quit to be THE quit. But each time I quit smoking I get such a brain fog and things just don't seem 'real' could this be an effect of nicotine withdrawal?

When I've gone back to smoking it seems to go away but I'm not happy smoking so this has kept me stuck.

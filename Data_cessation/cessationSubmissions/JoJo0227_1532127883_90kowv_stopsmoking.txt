Day one - hopefully the last day one

Threw away half a pack yesterday. Getting too tired of half measures, trying to quit entirely. I hate being out of breath, and I hate how I smell during the day after a smoke break. This is the â€˜ â€˜teenth time Iâ€™ve quit, I really want this to stick. Wish me luck ðŸ¤ž

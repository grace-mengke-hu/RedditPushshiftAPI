28 Days Later...

And not a single cigarette has been smoked. Not one. Not even a quick drag. I feel great and have already overcome some hurdles such as being in a casino, being drunk and not breaking, as well as other triggers, e.g. driving in my car, lunch breaks, after meals, etc. 

My advice is to simply tell people you “quit" instead of “I'm trying to quit." Also, make sure you are committed to quit and want to change your life for the better. Use this sub Reddit in moments of intense cravings or weakness. The amount of excellent advice on this sub Reddit is fantastic. The best I've received was think of quitting as not giving something up but rather, gaining a lot.

Keep at it everyone who has just started and those who've gone much longer than myself. The world is a much better place as a nonsmoker (smells a lot better too)!

Edit: First 3-5 days were tough. I had some bad withdrawals and was very irritable. Once I got past day 4(?), I was pretty much out of the woods for physical cravings.

40 days in..

I just saw that I've quit for 40 days today. So far, it's been great. I thought I'd share with you some of the things I've achieved since I've quit.

- Saved about 350 euro's more than usual.
- Cut down on ALL my spendings (buying less stuff I don't need)
- Lost 5kg and counting
- Ran 5km for the first time without being completely out of breath
- Have a more regular sleep cycle (and be more energetic throughout the day)
- Got promoted at work (intern -> junior developer)
- More healthy lifestyle in general

I hope these (maybe small) achievements inspire all you ex-smokers to keep it up as well!

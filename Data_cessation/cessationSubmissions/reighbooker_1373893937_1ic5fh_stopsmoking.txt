I'm experiencing a serious internal struggle right now

I intended on quitting with the help of Chantix, thinking it would be around $150. Funny side note: my insurance won't cover any cost of it- which is odd- if any one should want me to quit, it should be my health insurance. But went to get it filled and it costs $460, for one effing month! I started feeling incredibly anxious. I had planned on using this to help quit and now that "easy" option is no longer there. I instantly put of quitting in my mind because I needed this extra thing to help me quit. (I realize this is ridiculous and not true- but it's how I feeeel!) 


I went out of town during the weekend and didn't smoke. It's always easy when you're not in your routine, isn't it?! Come back home- have 4 left in my pack...I smoke them all. 


I don't know if I want to quit yet... however, I realize that is the addiction talking. So now, I'm sitting at work with no smokes and arguing with myself. Do I want to quit? Or maybe wait? Wait until you've finished reading Allen's Carr book? Or, just shut up and quit!!! I don't know what to doooo!

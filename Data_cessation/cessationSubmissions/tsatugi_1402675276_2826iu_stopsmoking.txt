I need to voice some thoughts, and this seems like a great place.

I haven't smoked in 10 days. I had a big surgery seven days ago, and this was motivation enough for me to stop, at least for a bit. In an attempt to ensure it went smoothly, I quit a few days beforehand so that oxygen levels would be good, no carbon monoxide in my blood, better lung function, and any other benefit that not smoking might entail. I had a bad reaction to a certain anesthetic in the past so I was serious about being in good shape for this thing.

Anyway, my current cessation is partially due to the fact that I'm staying with my parents. Both of them are in the medical field and see lots of smoking-related issues, and my dad was a longtime smoker. So they're totally opposed to my smoking, but they don't really give me hell for it anymore. Either way, this is probably the easiest place for me to not smoke.

Here's where issues will arise: Basically all of my friends are smokers and we tend to party pretty hard. Based on my past attempts to quit, I'll probably smoke a cigarette the next time I get drunk with them or the next time I take a road trip. I've made some big steps, and I want to keep this up. Typing all this out helped in itself, but I'm hoping the advice and encouragement of this group will help me to keep it up.

Edit: I haven't already given up. I should have said "Based on my past attempts to quit, I'll *struggle the most to not* smoke"

Seeking some words of encouragement, approaching 30 days.

I have been smoke free for 28 days today. Since my (nearly 10) numerous cold turkey attempts failed, I tried the patch, and after step two I got annoyed (it was itchy and made me urine a lot, made me shake).

So I've been using gum.

Now I am one day down from the gum.. this is just as bad as quitting cold turkey!

I kept saying I would vape or get gum or a patch before I light up. 
But I don't want ANY nicotine, I am sick of feeding that fucking monster. I want it gone. 

Please tell me it gets better soon enough! Damn

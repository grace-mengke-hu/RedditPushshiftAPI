I've been smoke free for 28 days using the juul

I know, i know. But i smoked pretty heavily for 13 years and I have tried and failed multiple times cold turkey. I am having great success by using the juul. I've been very mindful of the amount of nicotine in each pod and have been using the juul as conservatively as possible. I'll taper off of this with a vape of some kind and then hopefully i'll finally break the cycle of nicotine completely.

Having said all of the above, for those of you who have used a Juul to quit, when did you start to feel better? I can tell you my lungs are functioning so much better than they have in the past 13 years. I can smell things and taste things. The negative of this is my anxiety has gone through the roof. I'm tired all the time. I'll get headaches every now and again. I just feel like i'm always withdrawing from something despite my Juul usage. Some days are definitely better than others. I have no idea what this could be, but maybe others have had a similar experience?

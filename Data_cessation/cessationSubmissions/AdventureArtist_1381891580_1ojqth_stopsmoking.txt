6 months succafree in Bangkok; Killing the beast.

I came here to yell some sense into an on-the-fence potential quitter, only to realize that it’s been six months since my last puff. I don’t intend another puff, ever. 

I’m running in the gym. My teeth get whiter every day. My girlfriend doesn’t give me disapproving looks. I’m not a slave to that awful beast of an addiction that tears me away from what I’m doing to smoke incessantly at every turn, between every store, at every wait or free moment. It was not a life of peace, but of servitude to the nicco-bitch mistress. 

But that’s all over now. I’m clean and fresh and I feel good. Even though cigarettes are $1 a pack and I can smoke in many more places than many of you, I don’t even flinch, or see the cigarettes anymore. I’m not interested. I’m not involved.

I’m not a smoker. 

Fuck cigarettes.

Third time quitting, it's been about a month now.

I miss it so much. I have to imagine cigarettes as a loved one who died. I mourn them, I miss them, but there's nothing I can do, they're never coming back.

But obviously I did go back, a couple times. Why does it have to be so enjoyable?

Of all the dumb shit I ever tried as a dumb kid, the biggest regret I have is smoking.

Please let the third time be the charm.

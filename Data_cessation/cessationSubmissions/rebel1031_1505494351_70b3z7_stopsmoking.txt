One month in and it's much better now.

A couple of weeks ago I posted an angry....having a tantrum post.   Now I'm at 35 days and don't see ever smoking again.   The change happened gradually starting in week three.  I suddenly was capable of seeing myself as a nonsmoker for a few minutes at a time.   It's now been a few days since I've had any craving at all.  I won't let my guard down but things are SO much better!  Thanks to this group I've stayed clean and have hope of genuinely being a nonsmoker!

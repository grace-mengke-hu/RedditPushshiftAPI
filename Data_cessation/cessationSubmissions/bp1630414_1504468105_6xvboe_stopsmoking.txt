Acne and smoking?

Hello, I want to quit smoking. I am afraid that I won't make it since I have often tried it before but now I am looking for a job, a new flat and I am also in my first relationship with a man who doesn't like my habit. A good time for new beginnings and quitting bad habits.

I have problems with my skin again. My acne is back and my skin is dehydrated. I smoke around 25 cigarettes a day. What are your experiences when you stopped smoking? Did you see any differences in your skin after quitting?

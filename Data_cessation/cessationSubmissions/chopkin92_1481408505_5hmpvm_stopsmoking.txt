Okay, so...

I'm 18 hours in, and it's getting really difficult. I keep catching myself rationalising to smoke, like thinking I'll have one cig now then have a complete no smoke day tomorrow.
Obviously that's the nicotine demons in my head, and it's complete bullshit. One cig now, and I'll just keep smoking.

In my last post I got a lot of weird, obscure craving killers that really did work! Has anyone got anymore, cos I'm getting desperate..

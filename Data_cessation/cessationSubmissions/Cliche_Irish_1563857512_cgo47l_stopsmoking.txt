Dip alternative cancer causing?

I found something called hooch which replaces chewing tobacco. Are there any risks to using herbal tea pouches? I understand chewing has risks so please don't lecture me im already aware. 

I'm trying to quit chewing and these seem like they would help out a lot. I really dislike my chewing habit and would like to find an alternative. These tea pouches seem like the ticket for me.

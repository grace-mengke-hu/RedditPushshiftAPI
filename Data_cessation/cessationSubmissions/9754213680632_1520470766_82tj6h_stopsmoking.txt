Swapping one bad habit for another...

It's been a week since I had my last cigarette. I feel so much better for quitting and am enjoying the new sensations of being smoke free. I enjoy properly tasting my food, I (and others) enjoy the fact that I no longer have bad breath or the smell of cigarette smoke sticking to my clothes. It's nice to be able to walk up a hill and not feel like someone has punched me in the lungs! I have one question...

I stopped drinking fizzy drinks last month, for unrelated health issues that still don't really have a root cause. When I decided to quit smoking, I suddenly started chugging diet coke and pepsi like there's no tomorrow! I thought that maybe I was substituting one bad habit for another, or that maybe my brain needed a stimulant of some form and now that I'm not getting nicotine, I needed caffeine instead, but I wanted to see what you guys thought here. 

Is it worth trying to kick the fizzy drinks as the same time as the cigarettes or should I leave it for now and tackle the fizzy drinks later on when I'm further into quitting smoking? Any thoughts / guidance is greatly appreciated.

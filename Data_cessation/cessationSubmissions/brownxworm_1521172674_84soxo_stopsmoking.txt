Looking for an article to explain vaping to my mom

so my mom found my cigarettes for like the 800th time and I told her the only way I can stop is if she buys me a vape. However she thinks that vapes are used to smoke weed and that it is harmful like smoking. I need a way to explain to her what it is and how it helps with quitting smoking. If anyone knows any article which pretty much explains vaping to a 50 year old brown mom please post the link. Thank you.

I just scared myself straight. Beginning day 1 right now.

My ex girlfriend got me started smoking regularly. Before that I may have one here or there, but it definitely was not habitual. That was four years ago now. I haven't been a particularly heavy smoker (3-5 cigarettes a day average), but I'm noticing the effects of it poor circulation, throat clearing, sinus congestion, etc. 

You know how binging WebMD works. You start thinking you have every illness in the book. Well, I've been reading all day about lung cancer, COPD, and other smoking related illnesses. I don't want that to be me. I'm done. I'm out. I enjoy exercising too much to not be the best I can be. I'm 28. I have an amazing girlfriend. I want to have kids. There's too much to look forward to in my life to shackle myself to this vice. 

I'd appreciate any wisdom you can impart as I begin this journey.

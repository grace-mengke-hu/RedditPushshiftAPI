I failed after 36 days

Well I hurt so bad, I never experienced any kind of pain like this and had to ride 1 1/2 hrs to see a specialist and then 1 1/2 hour home.  Crying both ways.  So I guess tomorrow I start over.  Iâ€™m not going to feel bad! After the week Iâ€™ve had and the last 24 hours. Nope not gonna feel bad ðŸ˜ž

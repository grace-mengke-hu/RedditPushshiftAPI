Happy to be among you all

Hi all. 

I quit smoking 12 days ago.  I’m using the patch and CBD oil, and have been in decent spirits except for today.  Today I was in a super bad mood.  

I plan to be active in this sub, to stay motivated and to encourage others. 

I’m grateful that I’m breathing better, I smell better, I’ve saved a decent amount of money (already!), and I am sleeping pretty well too.  I’m eating more, but I’ll let myself get a little fat for a while until I get a better handle on this cigarette addiction.  One thing at a time....

Best of luck to you all.

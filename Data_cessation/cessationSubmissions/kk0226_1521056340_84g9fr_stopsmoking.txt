I've some how made it 129 days even through an unexpected divorce...

In the past 129 days I've someone how managed to stay a nonsmoker.  In this time I got divorced which was not planned when I quit smoking, I moved into a new home, I've spent countless hours alone in boredom and I've had a handful of nights out with friends who do smoke.  I've stayed strong the time I've wanted one I've just told myself no but the majority of the time I don't even want one.  I'm in a great place right now but I still cannot believe that I'm still going strong!!  It feels great!

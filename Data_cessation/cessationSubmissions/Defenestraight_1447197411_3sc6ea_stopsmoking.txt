20 years old, been smoking since I was 14. 11 days smoke free.

I'd been wanting to quit for a couple of years now. I'll be starting in the Royal Danish Army in just under 3 months, which was my primary motivation to quit smoking.  
I've been strength training for just over a year (and running for 3 months), but I could feel how I just wasn't getting enough oxygen to my muscles due to weak breathing, so I tired out easily.   
I decided not to use patches or nicotine gum.  
I can already feel my breathing getting better and I can finally smell things again!

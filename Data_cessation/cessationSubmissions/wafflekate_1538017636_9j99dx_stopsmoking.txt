100 Days!

I can't believe I actually got here. It was hard in the beginning and I felt like I was going to give in at any moment but I pushed through. I'm feeling so positive about this! One thing I really don't miss is that guilt every time I stepped outside. I'd tell my kids I was going outside to make a phone call. They knew and I knew they knew. It feels good to not have that shame feeling anymore. I'm motivated to keep going! Every day without a smoke is another day closer to being a true non-smoker! Keep up the good work everybody!

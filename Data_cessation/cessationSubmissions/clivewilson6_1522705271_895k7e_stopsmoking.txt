Quit 3 smokes a day

I smoke three a day. Its ritualized. Once when I get home from work (4 pm), once when the kids are in bed (7 pm), and once before I call it a night (10 pm). I've quit before, never really sticks obviously. My wife smokes too, she's not ready to quit. There's smokes in the house. How do I not??

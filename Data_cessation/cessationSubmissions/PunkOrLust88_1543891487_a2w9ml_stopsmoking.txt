Continually Relapsing

Quit for a month when I had sinus surgery and felt great and full of pride.  Ended up having what I thought would be “just one” cigarette and fell right back into the nicotine trap.  Every day since then has been my “quit day”, but I have relapsed so frequently, that quit days have lost all meaning.   I already struggle with depression and anxiety and really rely on cigarettes to mellow me out and “take the edge off”.  Don’t have a lot in my life that makes me happy or keeps me busy and I’ve just been feeling really down about myself for failing time and time again.  I feel weak and don’t think I’m strong enough to stay a non-smoker.

After work smoke trigger

I'm home from work and this is a huge trigger for me, the usual ritual is to pour me a glass of vino, have a cigarette and contemplate how my day was. 

I feel a little lost right now, not enough to smoke, but I'm thinking about it right now...constantly.

I'm wondering how many of you wanted to sleep the first week(s) away? What were your triggers and what positive or healthier habits did you replace smoking with?

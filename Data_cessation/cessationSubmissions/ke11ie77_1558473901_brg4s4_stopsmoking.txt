Depression

Is has been 100 days since I stopped smoking or vaping  and I’m wondering wether giving up nicotine is the cause of me being less tolerant, agitated and depressed.  I didn’t connect that it could be that as I don’t feel cravings that much anymore.  Definitely sometimes but not all the time,   Has/does anyone else recognise this?

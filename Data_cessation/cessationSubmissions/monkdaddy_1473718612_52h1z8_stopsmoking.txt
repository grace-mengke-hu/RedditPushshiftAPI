2 years smoke free

Today marks the two year anniversary of my very last cigarette. I fed the [good wolf](http://www.virtuesforlife.com/two-wolves/) and let the bad wolf starve. My breathing is better and clearer, I can climb stairs again. Food tastes better... Sex is better. I learned the scary truth that cravings occur WHEN you smoke, and not as a nonsmoker. I haven't had a cigarette craving in about 18 months. I am free. you can be free too.

Looking for a stop-smoking mate

I thought it would be cool to build up a pair to cheer each other up whenever one of us is tempted to smoke again.

Stopped a week ago, didnt smoke for 3 days but broke it yesterday.

Heavy smoker (30-40 a day) but didnt fully lost myself again. Now just 5-6.

Anyone stopping today ?

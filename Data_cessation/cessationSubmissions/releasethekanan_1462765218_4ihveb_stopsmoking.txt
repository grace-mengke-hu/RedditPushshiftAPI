My first time here I hope this works. :D

Hey, so I picked up a little smoking habit a few months ago when I started smoking cigs when I drank. I didn't co sistantly smoke cigs but I mixed weed and tobacco bowls and smoked them often(I'm kinda a stoner but I'm ok with thc and don't plan to quit that). 
Now I'm done with it. I'm just chasing a head high that's more tobacco than weed and that's the point I realized my addiction.  I am going to just vaporize thc and remove the option to mix with tobacco.  I went about 5 days cold turkey  but goofed today  and had a few to finish my herb and feel really guilty about it as I knew I was pretty close. Well I'm gonna be stronger this time and just wanted to tell someone.

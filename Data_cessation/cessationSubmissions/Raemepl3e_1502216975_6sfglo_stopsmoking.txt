Productivity

I'm a new quitter (new on this subreddit, 'quit' a few times before). I'm an overachiever (best medical school in the country, top of my class, scholarship, etc.) and I attribute my achievements to smoking. My productivity drops whenever I stop smoking and that's the single reason I start smoking again. I even have an easier time going to the gym if I hadn't quit.
Is this just a withdrawal symptom? Will it go away if I stop smoking long enough? Thank you

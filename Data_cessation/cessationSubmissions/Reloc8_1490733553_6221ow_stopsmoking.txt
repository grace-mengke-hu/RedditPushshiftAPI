Just wanted to see what my badge is at now...

Because I am still 100% quit and I don't remember the last time I wanted a cigarette...

Edit: I can't see it but no matter it's been well over a year and I've never felt better (about to turn 39, minimum pack a day for 15 years).

Stick with the quits folks and stay strong.

Nothing much to add. Just really happy to be over it. I generally feel much better and look healthier :) . E-Cigs helped me a little bit (I don't use them anymore), but what really got me to stop was realizing what happens to your body if you keep smoking. Reading some statistics on cancer and other illnesses and how fast they bring you six feet under really helped me to think more rational.

Edit: Thanks everybody. Without this sub I wouldn't have made it this far. The support from the people here and the badge really kept me motivated. I love you all :)

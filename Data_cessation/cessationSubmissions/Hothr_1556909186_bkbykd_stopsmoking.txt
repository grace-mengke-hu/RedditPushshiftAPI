Successful night with a drinking/smoking buddy

Had a friend from high school come back home for a visit.  Last night we had a few beers at a bar, went home and played video games (drinking) then took a walk to get cigarettes because his vape ran out.  

I've been smoke free for about a year (vaping), and nicotine/vape free for 77 days.  I quit vaping because my girlfriend was concerned about my health.  

I was tempted, but I thought about it as we walked to the gas station.  I don't think that she would have been too upset about a relapse, but I knew she wouldn't like the smell.  Going home, smelling fine, and not dealing with nicotine was ultimately more important to me.  By the time we arrived at the store, I had made my decision, and I had no urge to touch the cancer sticks.  My friend smoked a couple on the way home, and it didn't bother me.  It was like I was a non smoker again.  

It was a great night, and I woke up with kinda bad hangover, but it was a good victory.

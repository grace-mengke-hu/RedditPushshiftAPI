Anxiety be gone!

So for the past few years, a minor anxiety issue has at times negatively influenced certain aspects of my psyche. Smoking was my only weapon to combat this. Or so I thought. I am now 70 days smoke-free and have had ZERO anxiety related sensations or thoughts. If this is the only positive to come out of quitting (which it definitely isn't) it's been so so worth it. I couldn't resist posting this because if I had heard this advice years ago it would have pushed me to take that leap of faith toward quitting. 

MERRY QUITMAS EVERY1

Every time I see an article titled “teenage juul use may cause them to shut down” I die a little inside.

I have smoked cigarettes (2-5 packs a week) since I was 13. I am currently 23 and I have tried everything you can buy to quit smoking, since I was 18. My juul is the only thing that has helped me. I have used multiple “vapes” but the pure convenience has been the thing that helped my stay on track. I understand that teenage use isn’t legal and not really ideal. But the fact that most of my friends and everyone that I went to high school with smoked at some point. It’s “cool”, I get it. But please don’t ruin this for me. 1 month strong, I need to stock up before the youth ruin everything.

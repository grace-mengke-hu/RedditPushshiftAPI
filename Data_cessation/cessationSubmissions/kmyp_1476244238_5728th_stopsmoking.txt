24 hours down, a lifetime to go.

So I decided after a night of heavy drinking and HEAVY smoking that I was done with cigarettes for good. I'm sick of smelling like an ashtray, worrying about the people I care about finding out that I smoke, worrying about my health, and constantly having my next cigarette on my mind. 

Wish me luck!

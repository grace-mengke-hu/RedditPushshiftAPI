Is this normal or is it all in my head?

Hey friends! So I quit smoking after 8 years of it 4 days ago cold turkey. I have the obvious symptoms like strong cravings, irritability ect.. but I've noticed the last few days that I seem quite a bit less intelligent. I can't seem to find the right word sometimes or just not as sharp as I usually am.

Has this happened to anyone else? Or is it just me blaming this on quitting smoking? I'm just hoping it passes!

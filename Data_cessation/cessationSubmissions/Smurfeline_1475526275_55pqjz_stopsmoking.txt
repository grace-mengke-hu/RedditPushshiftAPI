62 days with ecig after 22 years of smoking

Yes, I know.. replacing cigarettes with ecigs is not quitting. But I must say, it has been one of my wisest decisions yet. After 6 weeks I tried one puff of a normal cigarette and it tasted AWFUL!! How the heck did i convince myself for 22 years that cigarettes tasted good?? In addition there has been a lot of other bonuses, such as better sense of smell, a disturbingly better breathing while running etc. And a few mental changes; When you know you are inhaling theatre smoke in order to satisfy the need for nicotine you cannot play yourself anymore. You have no more excuses. It is not the taste of cigarettes. It is not the familiarity with cigarettes. It is not the habit. You are an nicotine addict, period. And that knowledge helps for my next step. :)

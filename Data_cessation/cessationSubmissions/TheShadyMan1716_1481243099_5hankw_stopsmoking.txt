Family members smoking in garage

I'm 13, and in eighth grade, and I've been around smokers for most of my life. We live with my grandparents, who are both heavy smokers. My grandpa sits in the garage for most of the day chain smoking, while my grandma goes into the garage a lot to smoke, and both of them smoke in there at the same time. Either they're too stupid to realize, or too ignorant to care that their smoke permeates the rest of the house. I'm on the basketball team at my school, and constantly breathing in secondhand smoke has been affecting my breathing very negatively. I've asked so many times for them to stop smoking in the garage, but they won't budge. Now that it's winter, they will definitely not go outside to smoke, which means that they'll always go right to the garage and start smoking. Does anyone have any ideas on how I could stop this problem?

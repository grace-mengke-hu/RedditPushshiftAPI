It's been 4 months and 17 days, I find myself craving today like crazyy.

So as the title says I'm pretty far in quitting but what's strange, a day before today I got a dream about smoking again, and it was so vivid that I thought I relapsed irl. But it's worrying, what the hell is even this addiction, I keep getting dreams about smoking regularly. And sometimes I crave like today for no particular reason. Like I still feel stressed and I feel like after quitting something's missing in my life. For health reason I'd rather not smoke again but.. I'm still craving, might as well just say f it. What's up with this stuff, maybe I need some vitamins or something..

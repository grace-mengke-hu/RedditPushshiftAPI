50th times the charm

I am 4 and a half days into being completely nicotine free. I'm 32 and have smoked consistently since I was about 16. Half my life. That really hit me and I decided this time I was going to go cold turkey. No substitutes like every other time, no "I deserve" nonsense, or "I'll just have one, cause it's been a week" bullshit. No count downs, or e cigs, no gum or pills that make me feel jacked up and sweaty. I just knew it was time, this time. It feels different. I've been using an app called Smoke Free and I think visually seeing all the things has really helped me. Seeing how many cigarettes I HAVEN'T smoked is eye opening and the health improvements are impressive. Don't get me wrong - it would be nice to smoke right now, I can't decide if talking about it makes it worse or not, we will see....

Tomorrow will be 28 days

Just a few thoughts I wanted to share. I've been really good about quitting this time. Ice stopped twice before but this time I'm more optimistic for the reasons I'm quitting now. I'm 26 and am finally started to consider making good decisions for my long term health and happiness. 

Work was the biggest struggle at first for me, because I work at a call center where everyone I socialize with smoked. So ice been making a habit of getting more friendly with those other people that hang out break room, but all my old smoking buddies have switched to capes to work towards quitting and won't stop talking about vaping. This has been cold turkey. I don't want a cape or to waste the money.

This wouldn't be that bad, but my roommate and best friend who never smoked decided to start gaping and vapes a LOT. This dude just blows clouds every time we hang out in our living room. I want to blow clouds too, it looks like fun. But I'm not giving in to any temptation. Vapes are just as bad as smoking when it comes to smoking. I've talked to him and he said he'd try to be more considerate since he vapes in common areas. Still tempting.

I've been drinking a lot of water and eating an apple a day. For some reason the apple feels time consuming and habitual enough. That and some weed every now and then. 

Shout out and much love to everyone here trying to quit or is living that smoke free life.

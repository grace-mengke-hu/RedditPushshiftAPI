Stopped for the umpteenth time on 28th April 2015

I started smoking at about 11 but 20 a day at about 14. I tried to give up at 18 and then at 21, through the years I have given up, sometimes for up to two years, but always gone back to the digusting weed. My most succesful attempt was after reading Allen Carrâ€™s "Easyway To Stop Smoking" - That book is amazing. I gave up with no withdrawals and I was stunned. 

I made the fatal mistake of thinking that I could smoke if I wanted to and one night after a lot to drink, standing with smokers, I took a smoke that was offered. The end.

I decided to stop again and used patches which didn't work for me and then just stopped. No patches - nothing. I have been fine up until I got drunk on the weekend and had two. The next day I am back to not smoking. I am NEVER smoking again.

I reckon tobacco companies have a lot to answer for. I really hate them.

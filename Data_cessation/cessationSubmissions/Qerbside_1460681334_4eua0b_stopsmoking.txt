Champix side effect

Just wanted to vent and see if it helps.

I took Champix for the first time about 6 years ago. No side effects and successfully quit for 5 years. I then had a few events that led me to pick up the cigarette again.

I've been smoking for the last year and started champix again on Monday.

I'm getting daily nausea, but what's two months of nausea compared to lung cancer, right?

Today was different. About an hour ago I needed to print a 10 page document for my boss. A young woman from the office was already at the printer doing a 50 page document, so I sit back down.

When she finishes I print my things and realise I made a mistake with the letterhead. Put them in the bin, come back to my desk, fix the issue and head back to the printer. I noticed the young woman had returned and started a 200 page document with 7 more printing jobs pending.

My mind goes apeshit...

WHO DOES THIS CUNT THINK SHE IS, IS SHE TRYING TO FAX OVER THE FUCKING RAINFOREST ONE PAGE AT A TIME. I REALLY need to print this fucking document NOW. I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS BULLSHIT. FUCK HER!!!

I sit back down

FUCKING BITCH (I throw my printing card at the wall). My saner mind kicks in.

duuuuuuude, why the fuck are you this upset about the printer?

>I don't know, I'm being ridiculous 

You're being ridiculous, this isn't urgent in any way. Shape or form. She's a nice girl and you really get along.

>It may be the Champix, I know sometimes it affects people differently.

So I hop on the Champix website and there it is, serious side effect, agitation and aggression.

Now it's taken me almost 30 mins for all my back and neck muscles to stop contracting. I would never act on anger impulses but I'm scared that if my doctor makes me stop taking it that I'll smoke myself to the grave.

Anyone else find a way to get through these feelings?

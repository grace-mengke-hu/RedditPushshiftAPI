Day 120

Never thought i would accomplish this. And I don't think I would of without /r/stopsmoking

That's the thing about our decision, generally speaking friends and family are simply like "well done" and that's it. You fine human beings actually get it! The decision we made was/is monumental 

New Years Eve my time, but am not feeling scared about tonight at all.

Well done everybody :) Keep up your attempts and if you relapse then just get back on the horse!

I relapsed ..


Went to the gas station at 530am, bought a pack of cigs and proceeded to smoke the entire thing. I relapsed.. HARD!

Drama with the gf. 

Im sorry, not only to you, but mostly to myself for being weak. 

The only advice i can offer is be prepared for these moments: when you're piseed and upset. When you want nothing more than a cigarette. It wont help. Plan for those moments and have an escape route.

I'll be resetting my badge :(

Stuck in cycles

I keep going through cycles of quitting, doing well cold turkey and then having a bad event happen and turning to smoking as a "fuck everything" coping mechanism, usually tied in with heavy amounts of drinking. Great ways to deal with problems...

I wake up feeling like shit and scrambling to reestablish my routines. I've smoked "lightly" (some days none, some days 2-3, some days almost an entire pack) since I was 16 and I kept telling myself I would stop "when ... "when I graduate college, "when I turn 25," "before 10 years," 

11 years later, I'm 27. I need to quit. I need some virtual support. I need to love myself. This is day one.

Longest break from nicotine in years!

Hi again /r/stopsmoking, it's good to be back.

I used to come on here about 3 years ago when I first moved to e-cigs but since lapsed (about 18 months ago). I now feel e-cigs are not right for me as they keep you addicted to nicotine and I ended up using them all of the time, which only lead to me upping my desperate need for nicotine. After a while I decided that at least with cigarettes you can't smoke indoors, so I'd probably make a net health improvement by moving back to them!

Anyway, I digress. Just before new years, I was finding that cigarettes were simply becoming unpleasurable - I think I had a mild chest infection. Whatever the reason I found myself just not wanting to smoke and just like that, I quit. It was like my body just told me enough is enough. After a week or so I did find cravings to appear (when drunk specifically!) and I have ended up having around 5 cigarettes in total since, although I haven't had any this weekend even though I had a few drinks, which makes me very happy. I don't consider these cigarettes "lapses", although I do recognise that they could contribute to full lapses and so need to be taken seriously; an addict can't enjoy in moderation after all, that is just wishful thinking. Maybe I'm cheating by not putting my flare back to "7 days", but I really feel it's been since before new years, just given the amount I was smoking before and the huge change in my behaviour.

So, I hope to stay on the horse indefinitely now; I'm getting too old to fuck this up again and I want to give myself the best chance of having a healthy life going forwards. I look forward to participating in this community more regularly again. :)

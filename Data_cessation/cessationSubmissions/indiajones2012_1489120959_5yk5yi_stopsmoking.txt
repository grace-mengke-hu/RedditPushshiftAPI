Thank you guys!

Today I complete 555 days of not being a smoker. I have been a long time lurker. I quit smoking and started running. Replaced one (bad) habit with another. All thanks to the motivation and support that this community provides (especially to the lurkers like me). Thanks! All of you are awesome.

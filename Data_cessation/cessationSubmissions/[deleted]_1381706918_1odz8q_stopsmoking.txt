i feel like i'm going to explode.

k, well. you know how girls go through pms and (sometimes) get irritable and emotional? i feel that way and i'm not going through pms. i quit smoking 3 days ago. i feel like ripping my boyfriends face off (he also quit smoking, a few hours after i quit). i'm so irritated and i feel like blowing up and going on a full on rampage. everything is annoying me. i want to go out and do something with my day but like today, every day is the same. i don't feel like making small talk with my fiance, i don't feel like talking about anything verbally. ever.

does it get easier when you quit smoking with your significant other? i'm just ready to run away.

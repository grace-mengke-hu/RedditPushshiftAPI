I really, really need to stop smoking but don’t know how to

I started smoking ten years ago. I was smoke free for three years during these ten years, but started again because of stupidity and heartache. Now I really feel the need to stop, but can’t find any motivation at all. Im way past the heartache, and my life situation is pretty ok. I know I’m psychologically, socially and physically addicted to it. Every night before going to sleep I kind of promise myself to quit, and every morning after breakfast my brain tells me a smoke is absolutely necessary and that I can’t start my day without it. I kind of blindly follow this urge, and when my brain wakes up to tell me “You’re not supposed to smoke anymore!” I find myself with a half way smoked cigarette in my hand.

I absolutely hate myself for picking up smoking again, and I want to quit because I know it’s stupid, but I can’t motivate myself or find any way to trick myself. Last time I quit I was extremely motivated, and I also used that “not another puff, no matter what” application, and it worked the first time I tried it. I tried it again last time I wanted to quit, but it didn’t help me stay motivated this time, and I got to three days without smoking with devastating effects. I was literally throwing myself at the walls from anger while screaming like a maniac. 

I have absolutely no idea how to quit. I’ve also tried medication, but it doesn’t help me at all. Would slowly cutting down on the smokes help? Does anyone have any experience with a situation like this and is there something I can do myself to help myself quit again?

help

smoked for 19 years. went out of country for 2 years. stopped smoking for 1 year, 1 month and 10 days. Able to run 6 miles non stop etc. Now coming back to US of A and going to old places, gives me triggers like i just quit last week. A thread is starting in the head looking for excuses to slip. Need to beat this. I failed so many times before....

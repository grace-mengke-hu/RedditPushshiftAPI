Excited for the changes

Okay, today is the day. I just woke up and decided I'm quitting. I'm using gum. With out the oral fixation I'd  turn to food and I'm well aware that this is going to lead to weight gain, and don't want to make matters there worse, So I'm using gum. 

I have been smoking since I was 14 and I'm 24 now. I have been smoking my entire adult life and I feel like cigarettes have become apart of my personality. Who am I without cigarettes? That's one of the biggest motivating factors, I want to find the answer to that question out, not to mention I'm just so fucking sick of buying and lighting up cigarette after cigarette. I'm just afraid I'll fail and return to them with newly justified reasons to continue. Does anybody have some advice or things to think about when a craving is coming on or when you just really want a one?

138 days and counting!

It has been around 4.6 months since I quit smoking and I've felt better every day! I'm able to walk around more without getting too winded(I'm a big guy so this is a definitely plus!), I've actually lost weight since I quit, and I don't have any urges. I have even proved that I don't want a cigarette because lately things in my life have taken a turn for the worse and I have been extremely stressed out. Throughout all of the stresses though not 1 single cigarette has gone into my lungs! Even my dad who has been smoking for 40 some odd years is quitting because of me! Thank you to this subreddit for helping me. Everyone's stories are what helped me get started.

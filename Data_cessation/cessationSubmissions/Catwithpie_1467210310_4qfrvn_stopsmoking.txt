I'm sick and still smoking

Not violently ill, but a head cold certainly doesn't make life easier. I think about stopping every day, but I'm terrified. Why is this? I've even been reading the book, and of course it makes perfect sense. Yet here I am, barely breathing and still working to get my fix. I don't want to wait until it's too late. I'm scared.

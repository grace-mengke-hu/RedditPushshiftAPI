Recently quit after realising I was addicted. Heart is beating harder today, is quitting why?

I feel a bit drained and it could be my blood flow being directed to muscles after working out but is withdrawal (from nicotine or tobacco) something that can make my heart beat harder than normal? 

It's not beating faster than usual just harder...

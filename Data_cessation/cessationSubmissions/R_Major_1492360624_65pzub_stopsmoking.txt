Quitting nicotine (this time, for real) Day 2 - running, sauna and some other thoughts

Hello again!

So, my 48th nicotine-free hour just passed by and I feel extremely great! I seriously thought that it will be much harder. I must say, your mind power is stronger than you think! :) 

I just came from sauna and before that, I went running! For beginning, I ran only 3.5 km. It felt awesome to run in fresh spring air. I was surprised how many awesome and peaceful running tracks there is around where I live. Beautiful pine forests etc. 

I have only felt a little bit of challenge and today, I'm throwing away all rolling papers, filters and other related things to smoking.

In conclusion, I'm doing well! 

End of day 2!

2 weeks down!

Staying positive but god damn today has been hard! Such a stressful day and cravings were off the charts. Today is day 15 and I’m not stopping! This has been the best and hardest thing I’ve ever done for myself. 

I hope everyone is staying strong and focused today and if no one has told you so far.... you’re doing great. You can do it!

Quick to Anger Still @ 2 Weeks

So it has been tough sometimes...I miss going outside to smoke and the after-work smoke, but only when I remember to care. I'm starting to just forget about it (the pangs and the self-congratulations, both). I think that is the path to being a nonsmoker, which is pretty exciting.

 All that aside, I'm having trouble with my temper. Small things set me off like a firecracker with a quickness that surprises me. My husband is the same way (quit at same time) and it even has made its way to our 2 yr old. It's hard to control and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this and if there is an end in sight.

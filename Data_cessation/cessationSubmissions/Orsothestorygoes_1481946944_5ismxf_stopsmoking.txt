[25m]I quit smoking over a year ago, i think i now have ADHD

I quit smoking a year ago. I had smoked close to a pack a day for 6+ years. Ever since i quit i have had a hard time staying organized. I have interrupted a lot of people and sometimes it gets to the point where they will tell me im rude. I dont mean to-its like my mimd has changed. I dont crave cigarettes anymore but i act differently.

At work my boss told me my performance has been slipping the past few months. I was denied a promotion that i believe i would get if i still smoked. I dont really have energy anymore. I havent gained weight really but i am not motivated to do anything. I work out and walk my dog but my mind is not focused anymore. I cant concentrate on a task like i could when i smoked.

My coworkers hate me because i do things like break the end off of sharpies ( like the part on the marker cap that allows you to clip it on your pocket) i dont mean to do this. My mind just has these weird impulses and like the interupting thing  i dont know im doing it really.

I asked my doctor what he thought and he recommended working out. I have been doing that but it doesnt help. He told me it was normal for former smokers and would go away after a few months. Well, that conversation was over 6 months ago and if anything it has gotten worse. I really think i need medication. I can never sit still, but can never concentrate.


As a former smoker i understand that drugs consume people's lives. I smoked weed ( when i was in high school) and smoked cigarettes. I never tried any medication or hard drug. This post will make it seem like i am a feinding drug addict but that isnt me. i wouldn't want medication unless i truly believed it was necessary.

I may switch doctors but what am i doing wrong? I dont want to lose my job/family/friends over this. I feel like i kicked nicotine out of my minds drivers seat, but im still not fully in control (if that makes any sense)

Please help! Thanks!

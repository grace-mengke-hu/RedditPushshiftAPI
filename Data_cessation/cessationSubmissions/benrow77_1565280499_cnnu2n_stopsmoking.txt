Fighting fire with fire...

I've started using one bad habit to fight another. In a typical day I'd get a craving for a cigarette, then go smoke. It's pretty simple. Now that I'm quitting, the cigarette craving hits and I counter it with procrastination. It's super effective. If you struggle with procrastination like I do, then you've got a powerful tool to use against your cravings. Just treat them like any other impulse that you'd put off for later. The craving comes to mind, you tell yourself "I'll do that later", and you've done it, you're past another craving cycle.

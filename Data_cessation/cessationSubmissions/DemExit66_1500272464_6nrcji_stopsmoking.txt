2 days in

Haven't had a drink since Friday night either. I need to taper off and have a beer and I understand alcohol accelerates nicotine withdrawal but I'm too tired to go to the store if I get weak. 

Climbing the walls every half hour.. Not sure which withdrawal it is. I haven't eaten this much in forever

Day 23: Do the cravings ever really stop?

I'm on day 23 and I'm holding strong using the nicorette NRT, but I get insane cravings every few days. Just earlier today I was checking my app to see how far I've come and just seeing how long it's been since I last smoked triggered a crazy intense craving. 

I didn't smoke and I'm finding it easier every day to believe I'll never smoke again, but it's also starting to feel like the intense cravings will never really go away, they'll just become fewer and farther between. Is there any truth to this or will the severity of cravings drop off over time to a point where I have no cravings?

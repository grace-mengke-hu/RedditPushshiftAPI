Allergies after i quit smoking?

Hi, i've smoked for about 15 years.
1,5 month ago i quit the cigarets and startet on a e-cigaret with nicotin,
One week ago i quit the nicotin.
And now i'm sick!
In the evening around 7, my nose starts running , i sneeze and my eyes gets itchy..i've never had airway allergies before.

Any of you guys experienced this.
Is it normal.
And will it go away again.

???

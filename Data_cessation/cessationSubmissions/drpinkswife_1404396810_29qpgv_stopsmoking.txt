I Bolted... :(((

Took myself to lunch. Lady next to me started smoking and the smoke was blowing in my face. It was fine. I wish it bothered me, it didn't. Then her first friend showed up and she put out her smoke. Then her next friend showed and they both started smoking and I started getting really uncomfortable. (and the lady who left her baby with me, who was now sharing my table, turned the pram so the smoke didn't blow on the baby). And then the pram was blocking my exit and I got more uncomfortable and I bolted. 

Not in a rude way, I hope. And then I felt like crying. 

And I needed something to distract me **right now** and Tescos was having a food drive. So I calculated the amount of money a pack of smokes costs and bought that much in items for the food drive. I thought that would make me feel better doing something nice.  And I still felt like crying.

So I came home. And I'm angry because its really nice outside, but I'm home because there are no cigarettes at home.

And now I'm going to bake a cake for my pity party!!!

**Update**

I feel better and I didn't smoke. **And I didn't want to smoke!!** I have no fucking idea what that was! I'm annoyed that my freshly washed hair stinks, but that's about it. Part of me was afraid, I think, that I was inhaling the second hand smoke and I'd have to detox again. And my detox was shit. But that's nonsense, right?! Tell me that's nonsense. Wow, I just figured that out whilst typing. I was scared I was inhaling the second hand smoke and feeding the monster!

Also, 1 pack of smokes = 1 bag of groceries. When I think of all the money I've wasted.

I'm watching the Allen Carr video posted by ELI, so the afternoon is not completely crap. :)

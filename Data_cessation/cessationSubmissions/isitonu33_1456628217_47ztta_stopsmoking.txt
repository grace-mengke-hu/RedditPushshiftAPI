Trying to quit smoking, have a few questions.

I have smoked one cigarette in the past 48hrs, none today. Is it normal to feel sick or do I just have a cold? Thursday I cut back to 3cigs that day. Friday I had one, and today none. 

Over the past few days, I have had such a sore throat, bad cough, terrible insomnia. (3-5hrs) at night. Terrible headaches, that come and go. I also go from being shivering cold to sweating hot. I can't tell if these are withdrawal symptoms or if I am just sick. I don't have a stuffed up nose at all which I always do when I get a cold.

Are these normal symptoms? Also a little diarrea that I've noticed. If these are from nicotine withdrawal, how long can I expect the sore throat, cough, and insomnia to last? Thanks for any input!

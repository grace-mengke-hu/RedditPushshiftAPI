Here's my first attempt in over a year. You guys kept reminding me to quit again, and helped motivate me. TY.

My strat is to keep my ecig handy and for some reason I have a sealed pack of smokes in my coat. It has helped to keep my calm in these first 20 hours, just knowing it's there, but not wanting to break the seal. 

This is the first time attempting to quit that I know I'll have the desire to smoke but also preparing myself mentally to resist the urge.

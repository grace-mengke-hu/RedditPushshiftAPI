Planning to Quit in a few weeks. Any tips appreciated

Hi friends, 

I've just recently recieved Alan Carr's book and am planning to read it over the university holidays and really kick this addiction in the teeth. I've been smoking a little over 4 years, but I can already feel the toll its taking on my body and my bank account and want to better myself.

I managed to Quit a really serious methamphetamine addiction 2 years ago cold turkey so I'm hopeful about quitting smokes but also not naive, i've never had to deal with physical withdrawal symptoms only mental withdrawal. Any tips that will give me a better idea of what's going to happen? I have a history of major depression and social anxiety so smoking has always been the crutch I lean on when Im not feeling great, it was a big part in my quitting hard drugs too so I'm worried about letting it go. 

Thanks

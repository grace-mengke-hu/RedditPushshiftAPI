Resetting my badge

While I should be 32 days free, I'm resetting my badge back to having quit today.  I started out really good, went a full 20 days before taking a puff of a friends cig, then 3 days later smoked a full one then my friend and I went out and I bummed three...Then I bought a whole pack :(  This friend in particular actually encourages my smoking.  She lights one then hands one to me.  She has actually said that she needs to keep me addicted this way I keep coming back to her to hang out.  When I first quit, she knew it, but still proceeded to light up when she got in my car.  I know I need to stay away from her, any advice on how to tell her delicately to stop messing up my quit??  She takes things VERY personally.

So, here I am again, day 1. I smoked about 5 out of the pack then decided last night that I just needed to break em all and throw them out.  The little voice in my head kept saying to save just one for an emergency, or to give the rest to my "friend".  I ignored that monster and threw them out anyway.  I feel pretty okay, but I know those triggers set me off: stressful family, enabling friend, consuming alcohol...

Anyways, wish me luck.  This time I plan on making it stick.

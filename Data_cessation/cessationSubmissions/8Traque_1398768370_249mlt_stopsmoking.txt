Ever have one of those days?

My mother finally succumbed to lung cancer on the 16th of April.  For the last two weeks, I've been planning her memorial, trying to watch out for my dad, straightening out all of the life insurance and everything that goes along with that ... 

I know that I just watched my mother fight a losing battle for the last 5 years that just *devastated* her.  I know that a lifetime of her smoking brought about this disease.  I know that in the end, she was in so much pain that she was welcoming death.  The struggle to breathe was so great that she'd rather die than continue on.

Throughout this whole ordeal, I've not really been tempted to smoke.

Until last night.

Last night, I had a dream that I was smoking again.  It was so vivid that when I woke up, I lay in bed wondering if it had been real.  I even asked my wife if I'd been smoking yesterday.  I was convinced that I was.

This morning, it's really been on my mind.  Not like before I quit- where I just really *needed* to smoke.  This is different, I don't want or even need one- but I can't get it off my mind.

I'm not in danger of relapsing or picking them back up, I just can't them out of my mind.

Do any of you ever have a day like this?  I wonder if it's grief, or sadness.... maybe it's the fact that we're finally done with mom's arrangements and I don't have much else to do but mourn?

TL;DR: Made it through my mother's death without ever wanting a cigarette.  The day after her memorial, had a dream I was smoking- now it's all I can think about.

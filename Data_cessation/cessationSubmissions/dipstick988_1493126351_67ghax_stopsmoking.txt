I relapsed after 90 days and I just needed somewhere to vent for accountability (dont upvote)

90 Days......90 FUCKING DAYS I WENT WITHOUT SMOKING!

I had never been more proud of myself as an adult. This was one of the hardest yet most beneficial things I have done throughout my life, after 8 years of succumbing myself to this disgusting habit I swore to myself that I was going to quit for good and start a new healthier and active life.....and then tonight after getting drunk with my dickhead friends I started to smoke again. I didn't go out and by a full packet of smokes or smoked throughout the whole night, but in moments of inebriation I had a few cigarettes and am pretty pissed off with myself. Pissed because I feel like all the progress I was making was going great and then I decided to shit on it in a time of a weaker frame of mind. Fucking Hell man.


I'm not going to go back to smoking full time again, the thought of me picking it up again makes me nauseous, and I will beat my new record of 90 days without smoking in the future...i just needed a place to bitch and moan so that whenever I get the urge I can read this and remind myself how shitty I felt since my last relapse.  

I'm off to go have a cold shower and try to avoid a hangover before work tomorrow morning.

i suck hardcore!

Im just going to say it as it it. I smoked again.... My grandmother died a few months back. She was cremated and today we spread her ashes. It kinda hit me bad so when i came home and walked the dog i lit up. I threw out my pack of tabacco and I`m going to go for my thirth try here. I hate myself for smoking again but today was tough.

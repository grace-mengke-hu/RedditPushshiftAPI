Welp, bye.

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking. I quit hundreds of times, but it never stuck
 until I was active in this sub over two years ago. Here I am, a new person who doesn't even remember 'smoker me' any more unless I really think about it. I needed you all, and I remain faithful to this sub in helping anyone who needs it, but I want to switch to just occasionally checking in. 

I love you guys, and all you New Year's quitters: just keep rocking. It gets so, so much easier. You will feel super human knowing how strong you are when so many are so weak.

Thanks guys.

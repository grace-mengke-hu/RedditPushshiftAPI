3rd day

Today is a good day. I played in a com shop after for 4 hrs and it helped me forget about smoking. I went home about 7 pm. While i was walking, I saw the store I used to buy cigar. My body was telling me to smoke but I thought for a moment and said to myself "SELF CONTROL" I just said it in my mind the whole time a walked until i was at home. When I see that store, I always remembered about smoking. Just remember that when you put your mind and heart to it, you can do anything.

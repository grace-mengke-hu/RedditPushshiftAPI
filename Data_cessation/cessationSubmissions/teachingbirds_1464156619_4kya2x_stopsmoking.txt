Best apps?

I'm sorry if this has been posted about before, I just can't seem to find a search option on the iPhone app.  
What are the best apps for quitting smoking? For motivation (like "today your lungs are a little better), how much money is saved, how many cigarettes you haven't smoked etc. They don't have to be free, just good.

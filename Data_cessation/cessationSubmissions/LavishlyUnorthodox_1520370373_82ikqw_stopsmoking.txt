Cigarettes are fucking poison and I'm done.

I'm in so much pain. My upper back and shoulder muscles should not be hurting like this. I'm only 25 years old for gods sake. My beautiful hair color is fading. My beautiful skin is suffering. I have little energy. I smell like shit all the damn time regardless of showering daily.

My singing voice.. my saving grace, my life; its damaged. Smoking did that.

Today is the first day I've ever broke down crying over this filthy habit. I'm done. Fucking done!! My back is killing me! I'm tired, I'm weak, and I'm really angry.

I don't think quitting this garbage could be any easier than it is right now. I'll take the temporary awful withdrawals as a sign of hope for the better future of my health. I don't even like this shit anymore. It's no longer enjoyable. I don't have money to be throwing at a habit that's ruining my quality of life and ultimately killing me.

Honestly, I'm thankful to be willing to take an honest look at myself and care enough to know that I can't do this to myself anymore. 

Fuck cigarettes. Fuck those dirty little life ruiners. I hate them so much. I want my health back!

How to get disgusted at the idea of smoking

A simple hypnosis technique I used almost 3 years ago to quit smoking made the idea of lighting up incredibly disgusting.

Its dead simple to do.

1) Think of a food that you can absolutely not stand.  Close your eyes and pay attention of where you see that in your visual field.  Right in front of you?  To a side?  etc.

You want to have a very visceral feeling when imagining this food in your minds eye.  Make the colors even brighter, maybe turn up some sounds, etc.  You want to be at the point where you can actually feel this disgust turning up.  Hell, get to the point to where you're gagging and on the verge of throwing up.

If it helps to turn up the gag factor, imagine other nasty stuff being tossed on this food.  Imagine someone spitting in this food.  Maybe imagine someone dumping a spitoon full of chunky phlegm on this food.  Toss in hair clippings.  Imagine a dog taking a dump on this food, etc.

2) Now think about the brand of cigarettes you smoke.  With your eyes closed imagine seeing a pack of your cigarettes in your imagination.  There's a great chance they aren't near the image of the food you find revolting.

3) Start to move this picture of your cigarettes over to the food you can't stand.

Hope you get the point.

Use your imagination and really turn up your gagging factor.  Imagine a big sloppy mess of that disgusting food, with phlegm, dog poop, etc. all over your pack of cigarettes.

Do this a few times until you can't take it anymore.  Then imagine this image of this disgusting concoction moving closer to your face.  This will definitely put you over the edge ;)

This is just another tool and pushing you over the edge and away from this horrible addiction.

Good luck!

P.S. I was gagging and almost threw up on my laptop while typing the stuff about the spitoon.  barf

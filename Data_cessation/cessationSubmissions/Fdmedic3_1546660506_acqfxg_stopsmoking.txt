33 hours...what the hell.

Ok need help people. Like the title says, I've been no smoking for 33 hours. This morning I woke up had two cups of coffee only so I wouldn't have any triggers. Been doing good on not having to may cravings. (Thanks to whoever suggested hard candy). 

However mid day I started getting stomach cramps and chest pains when I breath. I'm a medic so i know it's not heart related. But still is this the norm and how long will this crap last. It been going I'm hard waves sence 1pm..this sucks.

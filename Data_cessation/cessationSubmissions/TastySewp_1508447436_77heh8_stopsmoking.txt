Hi /r stopsmoking! I just threw away my last pack of cigarettes and popped a nicotine lozenge. Let's do this!

The longest I've made it was a solid 2 months cold turkey. Stress crept in and I caved. I want to stay quit for good. I sleep better, feel better, have more energy...loads and loads of positive benefits. I want to be free of this destructive habit once and for all. For good!

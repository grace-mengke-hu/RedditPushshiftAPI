My first time trying to quit

I am 25 year old male whos been smoking a little over half a pack a day since i was 17. When i drink i can smoke a pack in a couple of hours. Luckily, i havent been drinking nearly as much as i did. Im down to about twice a week. I work 40-50 hours a week, but dont feel i lead a stressful life. Im a pretty carefree guy.

Anyway, I went and bought a 2 week supply of 21mg patches and have been wearing my first patch for about 30 min. Im not sure if its all in my head or not, but i feel slightly euphoric and am developing a headache. This isnt the reason im posting, just felt that this info was relevant.

Im just looking for useful information from you guys. Any not-so-obvious tips or tricks for a first-time (and hopefully last-time) quitter? 

Thanks in advance guys and gals

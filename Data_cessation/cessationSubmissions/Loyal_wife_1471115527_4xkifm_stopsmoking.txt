You're not alone

We're all human mistakes are bound to happen just learn from it realize your triggers we are all too blessed to be stressed and hey like most ex-smokers we don't want ne1 2 say I knew it this quitting won't last long and talk smack about us I know it suuuucks big time but just remember this guilty feeling should you ever have that urge again and in doing so remember all the good that came from not smoking how happy you feel especially how good you smell 1 little setback is not the end of the world now go and go and continue being a quitter I'm a right along with you and so many others as well 😏

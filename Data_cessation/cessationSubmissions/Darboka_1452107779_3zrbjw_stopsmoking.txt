My first day without smokimg

First, I have to say that i never tought that i am capble of doing this until yesterday. A usefull tool that help me go trhow this day is the knowing that the will for cigarrte will go away in 5 -10 mins, and reming that to my self in the hard moments. 
 I hope that I going to finish my 3 years romance with cigarrtes. Tomorrow I face the weekend evening, I think that its going to be hard challange. But I won't dissapoint myself!

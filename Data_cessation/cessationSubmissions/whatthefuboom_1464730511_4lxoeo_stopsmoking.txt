Almost three weeks into my third quit

21 year old dude here. Started smoking at age 17.

My first quit lasted a couple of weeks.

My second quit was done with Allen Carr's Easy Way. I was able to stop for a little over three months before caving.

Fast forward to three months after my last quit... A couple of weeks ago, I quit again, on a whim. I told myself that I'd stop, and I did just that. It's the funniest thing, I have almost no cravings or mood swings and whatnot. No added aggression or anything of the sort. Sure, I've craved a cig maybe five or six times since I stopped, but it only lasted a few minutes and it wasn't that hard to just say no.

The hardest part of quitting is deciding to let go. It's hard to forsee a future without cigarettes. Once it's been a few days, though, it feels like quitting wasn't that hard at all.

Summer's here and I can't wait to go out for jogs without getting winded a few steps in. Fuck cigs. And as Allen Carr says: not one puff. Ever again.

9 days and counting :)

this is the longest ive ever quit after smoking 18 years at 30 a day. today ive got a little niggle telling me i want to smoke but nothing major, yesterday i didnt crave once, i feel completely free, this is how ive done it so far, completely cold turkey, bought my headphones to work, put youtube on my phone and listened to all allen carrs videos over and over for the first 3 days, then ive gone the weekend, just fighting it ( it was hard but do-able, and now when ever i feel i want a smoke i put my head phones in and listen to some more videos, theres plenty of videos to motivate you to stop, people that smoking is killing or killed talking to you about it.scientists telling you the risks and benefits, etc, try it if youre struggling. hope this helps some of you

Collecting E Juice Data

Hey r/electronic_cigarettes. So, for a side project I am working on I am trying to collect a large amount of data on the flavor profiles of various E-Juices that people vape. I have an excel spread sheet up with some examples of juices that I vape. I then want to take this data and given a persons preferred flavors choose juices from this list that would suit their taste using an algorithm I designed. But collecting this data myself would take a while, as well as my scope of what flavors I like is narrow, so I come to you. The excel file is a simple yes or no answer, whether or not the juice has that specific type of flavor going horizontal ( cream, fruit, tropical, tobacco,... etc.) and the juices going down vertically. This link that follows contains the general template of the data that I am trying to collect. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXTOgTJ_YDSvhuJQDdAt7nmpW6SybnJ4gQGSjuzQikk/pubhtml
Would you be able to fill out this form for what ever juices you are vaping, and post it on this thread for me to collect? I appreciate the help, as I am becoming very passionate about this project. If you have any suggestions as well as other categories I should add that would describe a juice, please let me know and I will take it into consideration. If you have a minute, please post your answer on here so that I can add it to my data set. Thank you again for any help this community can give me.

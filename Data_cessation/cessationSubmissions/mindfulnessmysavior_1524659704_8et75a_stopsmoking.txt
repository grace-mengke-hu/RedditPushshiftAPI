9days 19 hours Cold turkey after a relapse on day 37. This is what I think about smoking Now.

I have a feeling that you and I will probably never smoke again no matter what happens. Because unhappiness, sorrow, loss, gain, depression , achievement, etc are all part of our lives but addiction rewires our brain in such a way that we have to smoke to celebrate, to feel good, to boost our mood, to boost high from other drugs or herbs, after sex, while enjoying the nature alone. Addiction truly hijacks our brains and makes us a human robots that need nicotine to function. I have learned from my past failures that the relapsing might become a coping mechanism for some people. When the time for your relapse is near you will make yourself believe and eventually convince yourself that you are really stressed, you are really depressed, you are a loser, life is miserable, people are fucking annoying and dumb, nobody understands you, family is the most disgusting agency, marriage is the reason for all suffering, what's the fucking point of living life on this fucking planet with all these fucking people. You light up a cigarette. Let me tell you before you light up the cigarette your brain starts to release Dopamine to encourage you to go ahead and finally you Inhale that shitty smoke which contains Mother Fucking Nicotine. You suddenly realize how wrong you were, how pathetic pice of Shit you are, probably he was right, I might have over reacted, I could have easily avoided that argument, and so on.How you just convinced yourself that it's the end of the world. Nicotine and other such drugs fuck your brain to it's very core. You become a cancer of own. You always fight with your inner self who wants to live for good. But your addicted mind controls your thoughts shapes your mood. This is some scary shit dude. My curiosity to feel what smokers feel ruined seven glorious years of my life.

You guys

Im 2 hours shy of being 1 month smoke free. Cold Turkey. I have had the worst cravings the last 48 hours. ALL WEEKEND LONG. Its literally every 30 mins or once every hour that my brain is trying to talk me into going to the store to buy a pack. My brain is telling me that just one is ok and i have been so close to getting a pack probably 20 times this weekend. THIS SUCKS! I just needed to type this out here for help. Dont need the upvotes but any help is appreciated.  Ive said my mantra out loud probably 20 times and have had arguments with my brain (out loud) multiple times.

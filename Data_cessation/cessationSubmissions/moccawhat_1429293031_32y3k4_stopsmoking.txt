I bought a pack, help.

I've been going through a lot lately and today at work just made it worse. I took a few drags off a coworkers cigarette and it was downhill from there, I was so disappointed and broken in a fit of frustration I drove and bought a pack and I've been sitting in my new car crying and holding the first smoke. Need some encouragement now. I'm falling apart and feel like shit about this but I can't put it down, I'm frozen, fighting myself.

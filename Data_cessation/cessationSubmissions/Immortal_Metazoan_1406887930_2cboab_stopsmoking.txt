Someone just asked me if I had a cigarette they could bum.

And I was able to say no! This might not sound like much to most of you but this was a big deal for me. I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a month. I came home late after a night of drinking and a random guy at my apartment complex asked me, "Hey bud, do you have a cigarette?" And without a second thought I responded, "Sorry man, I don't smoke." And I meant it! That was my gut reaction! I don't smoke anymore guys. It's an amazing feeling and I hope that anyone reading this who is on the fence about quitting will give it up now. I feel like a completely new person, and I love it. I'm on top of the world!!

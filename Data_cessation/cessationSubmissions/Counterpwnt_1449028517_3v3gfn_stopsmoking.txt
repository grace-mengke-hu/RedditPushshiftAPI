Advice and observations of a repeat quitter.

I just stopped smoking on Sunday. For some background, I've been smoking cigarettes for about 7-8 years, never more than a half-pack a day (except on some occasions where I could smoke indoors and was sedentary all day).

I've tried to quit a few times before, sometimes only going a couple of days, the longest I think I ever made it was 9 days. I think some part of me told myself that if I failed, it would be a lot less depressing if I had only quit for a week or so rather than a few months. Genius, right?

Looking back, I can see all the ways my addicted brain tried (and is still trying) to trick me. Beyond the general twitchy feeling, skin crawling, restless legs, fuzzy mind, and flu'ish symptoms, my brain is a master at convincing me to smoke again. We've all felt the smoker jealousy. You see someone else lighting up, or if you're in the city like me, the moment you step outside it's all you can smell. Every little burning stick in Cambridge is going to pass by my nose tomorrow morning on the way to work. And I know I'll want to just rip it from them, growing into a monstrous creature as I consume all the cigarettes in the world because NONE OF YOU ARE CHERISHING WHAT YOU HAVE. Hahaha, but really, it feels like that sometimes.

I've had so many inner conversations already, almost all of them centering around how much I enjoy smoking; how smoking makes moments better; how it's a wonderful beginning (or end) to an experience. The biggest thorn in my paw is the idea that I will miss it too much. Can I *really* never do that thing again, that thing I did for so long? I think of the hundreds, probably thousands of cigarettes I sucked down—look back on them now and wish I'd cherished each one more dearly. It feels like losing a loved one... which is just ridiculous, just friggin' ridiculous. Good job, brain.

My advice to anyone who feels like they can't do it is to remember that the only reason we smoke cigarettes is to feel like non-smokers feel all the time. And no, that doesn't mean non-smokers just feel great all the time. They have to deal with stress, anger, frustration, loss, and boredom without a package of 20 little buddies. It's a symbiotic relationship and a double-edged sword. We smoke to feel normal—we pepper our happy moments, our triumphs, getting laid or getting promoted or buying a sweet new whatever with a friendly cigarette. Then we think we need them for those moments going forward. But in the same vein, we diminish the roughness of our bad days, the rainy skies in our hearts, the letdowns and no-shows, with the same little package. When other people get sick, the reliable smoker tarries on, already basically mildly sick all the time, ipso facto, not sick at all.

I don't hate cigarettes. The addiction I have is one of the more interesting, if not certainly tragic and humbling things in my life. If I could freeze time and just never face the rest of my life, I would smoke with abandon. But by continuing to smoke, that is what I'm doing: capping the room halfway up the walls and saying "pack it in boys, that's it." If I can move past failed relationships, broken dreams, and deaths in my family, I should be able to drink water and exercise through the physical withdrawals, and at least say a last goodbye to the act of smoking as I hold it, golden and harmless, in my addicted mind.

That's the hardest part, for me—saying goodbye to it. After all that time enjoying it, or for many of us, all that time despising it, throwing money and our sense of taste and smell away for it, it's really hard to just put the last one down and never wonder what might have been. Maybe it doesn't feel that dramatic for you, but it always has for me. But last Sunday, with no planning whatsoever, I took a puff—sitting in the same chair at the same desk where I snuck my first Camel straight pipe almost a decade ago—and decided I just didn't want to do it anymore.

The worst thing about quitting has to be the time. God it just goes so slowly. Can't I just be dead or terminal so I can keep smoking? It feels that way sometimes, and I'm only on day 3. How do I do this twice over, seven times over, a hundred times over? A hundred times the 3-day frustration I've been feeling isn't even a single year. I know it gets better, but when you're facing that down from the start, it feels completely insane to even try.

The only reason I think I can do it this time is that if my dad doesn't quit smoking, he's going to have some serious problems. I'm 28, and I've never been a heavy smoker—I can probably bounce back even if I do it a little longer (yeah keep telling yourself that, brain). But that's what my dad's been telling himself and now he's in his 60s and diabetic and almost just lost his foot/leg to a blood clot related to smoking and nicotine. His foot's on the mend, but I don't know if he'll ever really bounce back from this. I'm hoping he can manage to quit, and I think if I can do it, maybe it'll help him get there.

But if it doesn't, it's enough to remember that cigarettes killed my grandfather and grandmother already. They are an enemy I've spent too much time with already, though I continue to remember them fondly, as friends. Every day that I willingly smoke, I might feel better than I do while I don't. But at least as non-smokers, or ex-smokers (because let's be honest non-smokers don't understand this in any way shape or form and screw the ones who try to grandstand), we are upholding the idea that we actually want to live instead of bowing our heads to the 20 little executioners that we buy for $10 a pack.

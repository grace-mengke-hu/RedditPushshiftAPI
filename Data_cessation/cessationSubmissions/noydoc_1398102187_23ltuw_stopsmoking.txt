Thoughts on my quitting attitude

(Disclaimer: ADHD, so cravings are easy to dismiss, but medication made smoking feel really good.)

Cold turkey, on a whim. Not my first time quitting (third time I think), but every single attempt has been with this approach, and they've all been 6 months+.

Vilifying cigarettes as a means of motivation keeps a strong emotional tie to smoking- you're not ending the relationship, merely redefining it. If you don't pay attention to the power nicotine has over you, then it doesn't exist. So instead of focusing my energy on negatively thinking about smoking, I focus it on creating an attitude of indifference to smoking.

I stay around smokers and ensure I have a "mindful indifference" towards cigarettes. Smell's the strongest trigger of memories, so eventually smelling smoke triggers a subconscious indifference to smoking. This is how I can drink and not smoke, because my subconscious is dealing with my cravings. I'm particularly proud of that "brain hack", but it's only based on my experiences.

Any pitfalls I may not have thought of? I know around the 4 month mark I should start thinking about why I fall off the wagon after 6, but I can't come up w/ anything else.

13 hours 27 minutes

I posted earlier this week that I would quit on Friday. I haven't smoked today and it's been pretty easy due to my hangover and that I've only been awake for an hour and a half. I did go to the grocery store right after I woke up and I didn't get any smokes or even have the internal battle about whether or not to buy. I feel better about it today than I did when I made my first post. 
I'm very excited to see what it's like to run with clear lungs someday. I've smoked for half my life, since I was 15, so I really have no idea what it's like to be a non-smoking adult. Can't be that different tho. 
My boyfriend has never asked me to stop smoking, but I know he doesn't like it. I'm not telling him I'm trying to quit, bc I don't want him to know if I fail. We're long distance so it will be a while before he notices, but I really want him to be proud of me.

Stopped smoking (anything) Nov 17, 2018. Continued snus and then Nicorette until Feb 17, 2019, which was my first Nicotine-free day in a while.

I wanted to quit smoking for a while and used the occasion of a 6+ hour flight to switch from cigarettes to snus and didn't resume smoking. Whew. But then a new friend asked how I quit smoking and, being embarrassed that I still used snus/Nicorette, I didn't disclose that I was still on nicotine. I lied to cover my use of a substance. Well, that reminded me of another thing I quit: alcohol, and doing that I learned I'm as sick as my secrets. So, I took the next opportunity to correct my omission. Afterwards, I just stopped (on the AM of Feb 17, I didn't wake and take).

Quitting nicotine definitely had withdrawal effects: rage, irritability, mild auditory disturbance at the point of falling asleep,  stupidly-strong cravings, headache. Did I mention rage? But 36 hours later I was basically "normal."

Well, I joined this sub because just a few moments ago I was hit with an \*intense\* urge to use nicotine. WOW. So, I didn't, but I know a risky state (from quitting alcohol) when I find myself in one. So, I'm here to disclose my desire to stop smoking and STAY stopped -- and this, to me, includes nicotine itself.

Well, here it goes.

Hello non-smokers, at 6am MST I will be attempting to join your ranks. I lurk this subreddit quite a bit for motivation and I think with the weekend approaching I might have a chance. No work stressing me out for the next 3 days, the first two are always the hardest for me. I want this to stick and it feels good to know all over the world you all are making or have made the effort to kick this. If you read this thank you, sort of just a declaration but it feels like the right way to begin. I'll be requesting my badge at 6am and as that number grows I'll reap the benefits. Good luck, friends.

Update 1: Just woke up, had my coffee (work graves). 9 hours in to my quit and I have to admit my first thought was to have a smoke as I got up but instead I came and read all your responses, I appreciate the kind words. I'll follow up to this as it gets closer to 24 hours.

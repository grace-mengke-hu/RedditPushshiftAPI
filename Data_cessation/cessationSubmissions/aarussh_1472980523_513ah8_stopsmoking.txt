Day 1

Its day 1 for me ppl....I've been trying to quit smoking for quite a time now...failed every time...this time I'm going to do it with more open approach. I'm going to share my experience especially when it gets hard..I'll also chip in other posts to encourage my fellow quitters and hope I get the same in return...

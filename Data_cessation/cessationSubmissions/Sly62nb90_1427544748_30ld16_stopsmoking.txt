Feeling a little fed up with myself..

Been smoke free for about two weeks. Then for some reason the drive to quit just disappeared. It started as only one at work with a co worker. Then it was one in the morning and one at lunch. Then it was like ok fuck it let's just ask everyone around you for a smoke, and then someone gave me a pack of fresh Marbrough's (if that's how you spell it) from Sweden. I live in Toronto.. And I don't know if you know that brand but the Canadian ones are crap, the American ones are better, but these? These were awesome. So I took the pack and smoked half in a matter of hours. Then realized what I did and gave the rest away. Knowing I just let down myself and everyone that was behind me in the fight. Bad part is I don't care. And I'll I'm setting is the negative in every situation I'm in, the solution? A cigarette. I'm going to go the day without one and get back on track, that's my goal. But does anyone have any quitting tips? Like when you really need it, what do you do?

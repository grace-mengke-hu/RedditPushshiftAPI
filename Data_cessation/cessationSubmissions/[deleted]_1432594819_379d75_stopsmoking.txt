Someone help. I feel like I'm on a never ending roller coaster.

Hey everyone. I am going to try to word this as best as possible because I'm horrible at writing. I've quit smoking using the easy way for six months, I was drinking a smoked one cigarette then it was down hill from there. Ever since then I've had the hardest time quitting. I'm 26/f and I have smoked on and off for 8 years now. I've always hid smoking from everyone and its so hard. I don't want to smoke anymore. I'll quit for a few days and something will happen to where I'll make an excuse to buy a pack. This time around I stopped for three days and bought a pack today because my car broke down and I just put so much money into it not that long ago. I got in a fight with my boyfriend who I thought should help me since I help him when ever he gets into a bind yet he didn't help. We got into a fight which resulted in me buying a pack. 

I'm so scared of getting cancer from smoking. I see these commercials about cancer and smoking and they send me into a panic yet I'll still smoke when I'm stressed or upset. It's like I have no logically thinking when I'm
Upset and it's the first thing I run to. I'm looking for advice and support since no one knows I smoke and I don't want to tell anyone. I want to quit for good. Is there any other books or tricks? I wouldn't want to rely on gum or patches because I feel like cold turkey is the best way to get it out of my system and fast. 

Someone please help. I don't want to get cancer. I don't want to keep smoking. I want to throw this pack I bought away but for some reason it makes me so scared even thinking about not having them. I don't know what to do anymore. It's ruining my life.

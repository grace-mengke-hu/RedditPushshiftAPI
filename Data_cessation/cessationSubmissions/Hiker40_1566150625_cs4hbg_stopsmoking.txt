Day 1, with many setbacks. Need some support and accountability because I'm so done with this!

Hi all, first time posting here after reading a lot of entires for inspiration over the last few weeks. I was doing well for about 10 days (and felt so damn good!!), then had one slip up midweek and then basically chain smoked Friday and Saturday, out of boredom mostly I think. And feel absolutely terrible physically and have been beating myself up inside. So I reset my app and and starting over today. I'm so ready for a change and to stop hurting my body and mind. Let's do this!

Quitting on Wednesday

It's my millionth attempt. I have a plan, I have NRT lozenges, I have an app, and I have a friend who is going to stop drinking for thirty days in solidarity (I am also giving up alcohol for a couple of months to try to ensure success).

But mainly, I have a lot of fear of failure. Any advice?

Caved after 6 weeks, going for it again tomorrow

Male, 47, stopped for 10 years in 2005 and started again after some drinks one day. Stopped 6 weeks ago and was doing great and had a night out planned this weekend with lots of drinks, I walked home from work last Wednesday I had a craving like i've never felt before, it was an huge, overwhelming urge to smoke. From what I understand of myself, deep down I knew I'd likely end up smoking this weekend so subconsciously I already knew I was going smoke, which triggered the urge and that was that. 

As most of you will know, it tasted disgusting and the guilt and self-loathing is huge so tomorrow is back to day 1...wish me luck. 

I'm really hoping my willpower levels are up to the challenge as I was getting tired of battling them.

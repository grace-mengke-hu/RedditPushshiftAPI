Three weeks quit, cough develops?

I've heard of a lot of people having developing a cough for a few weeks after quitting, but that never happened to me. A few days ago I came down with a cold and kicked its ass pretty quickly, and was back on my feet after two days...however, there is this lingering cough that seems to  cause me to spawn balls of brownish gunk. 

I came down with the cold this past Friday, and the cough started on Monday, after I had already pretty much felt completely over the cold. Any opinions as to whether the cough is just body doing cleanup after the cold, or is it related to the smoking cessation? 

Edit: Was pack a day for 6 years.

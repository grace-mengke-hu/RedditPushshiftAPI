5 weeks in. The journey so far

It's been 38 days since I stopped smoking for good. However, just as a safety net, I got an e-cig/vape with 6mg/ml juice.
I really did not like the vaping experience: the taste was foreign, the smell too fruity but the missus loved that she did not have to deal with the cigarette smell anymore.

I toned down to a 0mg/ml juice and it hit me today that it's been 3 days since I last vaped. I'm now thinking of packing the vape away or giving it out to any friend of mine planning on quitting.

I really feel good about quitting this time because I have a genuine REASON to (healthier lifestyle) . And I want it really bad. Hanging out with friends who smoke doesn't worry me as much as it did before.

Thanks to this group for the moral support. Not another puff, no matter what!

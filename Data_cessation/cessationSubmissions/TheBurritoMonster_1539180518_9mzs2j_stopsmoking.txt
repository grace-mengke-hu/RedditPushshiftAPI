Sleep Problems

Hey all, doing awesome and feeling great on day 17, but have some major sleep issues.  I lie in bed for two hours before falling asleep. Once I do end up falling asleep I'm constantly tossing and turning, or just wake up randomly throughout the night. It's getting pretty ridiculous. I'm not sure if its something else or can be attributed to quitting smoking. Has anyone else experienced this? If so how long did it last?

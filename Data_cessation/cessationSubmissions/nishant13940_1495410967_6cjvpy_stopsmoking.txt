not prepared to quit smoking :(

I started smoking 4 months ago. I used to smoke once a day but these days it's a pack daily. I am trying to quit smoking but I feel that I am not prepared for it yet. I am loosing focus in office, home and everywhere. I want to quit smoking and be the guy who I used to be. help me guys... I smoked 3 cigs a couple of hour ago and I am pissed off right now..
and I have got cravings to smoke again already.

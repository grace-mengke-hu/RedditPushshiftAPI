14 days!

Hi guys,

It's been 14 days since I have had a cigarette. I have been vaping a bit but it still feels like I am doing something good by having quit analog cigarettes after 10 years of smoking a pack a day. It feels like an accomplishment and i feel really good in regarda to my breathing and such but still feel a bit like a cheater due to the vaping. Anyways, I hope to stop that soon also as soon as I feel like I have killed my habit of real cigarettes. It is also my 6th month of not smoking weed after years of smoking daily. I hope you all have an easy quit!
Enjoy your nights!

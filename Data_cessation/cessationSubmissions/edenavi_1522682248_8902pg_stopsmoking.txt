Trying again

I’ve tried quitting a few times since I became a regular smoker about a year ago. A friend of mine just switched to vaping a few months ago and is now nicotine-free and has been for a month or two, so I decided I’ll try vaping and working down my nicotine dosage. Bought what will be my last pack on Friday, and now am just waiting on my vape in the mail. Hopefully this is truly my last pack, and encouragement would be great. I need to kick this habit completely before I start another year of smoking.

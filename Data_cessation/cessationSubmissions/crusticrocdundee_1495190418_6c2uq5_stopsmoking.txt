I fucked up

My current badge, while not particularly impressive, in itself not really true. Under just a week in, I caved, and I'm pretty pissed off about that. In the past when this has happened, I've kind of went to a "well fuck it" mode but I don't know, I really really don't feel like starting against and (thank god) I didn't get a pack, just bummed some off friends. I'm not sure I can pull this off if I don't considerably cut drinking too. Even if I had to cut it entirely, it'd be worth getting off cigs.

Gotta keep trucking on

Got A New Shiny Star Today

It's so purty!

Still think about smoking a lot.  But such thoughts are progressively diminishing.  There's still one big trigger and that's at night around 8:30pm... it's after I'm home from work and have had a beer or two.  But now I know this and it's fairly easy to get through it. 

Had a dream the other night.  Me and two friends in close quarters.  They had packs of my favorite cigarettes.  And were smoking.  But I didn't want any.  That's cool.

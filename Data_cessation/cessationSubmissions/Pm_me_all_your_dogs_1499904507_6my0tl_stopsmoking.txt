Day 1

Alright. So I realized that I really do need to quit. Picked up some patches on my way home from work and I've had the first one on for a few hours. So far so good! I'm afraid of what will happen when I go to work tomorrow and have all the temptation there (work is where I always smoke. Never at home and never in the car). Any tips on what to expect from using the patches /your experiences?

See that number beside my name...

Gone. In an instant. 2+ years of not a puff. Just went out and bought a pack and smoked a smoke. I'll probably be really pissed in the morning. Life is too hard man. Can't even walk the dog without feeling like everyone in the world is watching and judging me. I'm a neet piece of shit and have been for over 7 years now. The realization that I'm just as fucked now as I was then was just too much. Always stay vigilant guys. Anyways the dart sucked ass. I'll probably have a few more then throw away the rest of the pack. I just hope I don't get hooked again. I remember for months in a row I would buy a pack, smoke some, throw the rest out, and try again the next day. I remember resetting my badge daily. Just wanted to vent a bit. Hope I didn't bum anyone out or give people ideas that they can relapse for even a second. Stay strong. I just wanted to post here so people don't get complacent and even if you are in the triple digits, you can slip up.

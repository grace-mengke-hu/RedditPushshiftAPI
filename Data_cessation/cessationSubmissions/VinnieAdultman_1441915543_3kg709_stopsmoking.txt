My coworker just helped me out.

I'm on my third day smoke free. Longest I've gone without a smoke in several years. Anyway, I'm at work and the cravings are hitting hard. My coworker and I are both assistants for an executive, and we take turns taking breaks on the patio. 

So I'm sitting here desperately wanting to smoke, when all of a sudden, I remember that I have a Swisher in my backpack (I still smoke weed fairly regularly).

"That's not cheating," I think to myself. "Just have a few puffs throughout the day, then keep on going smoke free." But I know that's not how it works. I'll have a few puffs throughout the day then, when that runs out and I'm on my way home, facing 45 minutes of freeway traffic, I'll pull into a gas station right before the on ramp and buy a pack. It's happened so many times. 

So I decide not to do it and put the cigarillo in my desk drawer. But I'm weak, and 20 seconds later I've taken it out, put it in my pocket and started to walk outside. Realizing I don't have a lighter (because I threw all smoking related items away), I ask my coworker if I can borrow his. He's on the phone, but he shoots me a disappointed look, then pulls out his lighter and tosses it to me.

As I walk toward the patio door, he quickly puts his line on hold and asks me if that's my first one. "Yes," I say, as I hold up the Swisher. "No," he replies firmly, motioning for his lighter back. "You were inspiring me. Keep going."

I consider just walking outside, but his encouragement makes me hesitate long enough to find a moment of strength. I toss back the lighter and the cigarillo. Deep breath. 

I can do this.

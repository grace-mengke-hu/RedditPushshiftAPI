Stopping drinking and smoking: A birthday present to myself!

My birthday is a month away and I decided to give myself a birthday present of not drinking and smoking for a month beforehand. I feel like it will be the best way to put my best foot forward going into my 27th year on this beautiful planet.

Happy to join you guys! Let's do this!

Back again. Never quit quitting!

I quit smoking several months ago for approx a month and a half. I’m currently reset on Day 4 after starting again for a couple months. I’m here to say be confident but don’t get cocky with your quit. I was on NRT (patches) and foolishly took them off after 1.5 months because I thought I’d be okay. I was smoking again within 2 weeks after a night out with friends. (The whole “ohhh one won’t hurt” mind trick. I do not trust wine drunk me! I’m on the patch again and I’m keeping them on! I need tips as well. I almost caved today. Been doing cardio it’s been helping immensely this time.

I've only just remembered I'm still quitting...

I mean the first week was hell, I got massive cravings every day. But around the 8 day mark things hit me like a ton of bricks. I stopped craving, then when I stopped craving I stopped remembering about quitting and cigs.

I ended up losing count on the days I'm on after that, why? Because I stopped even thinking of cigs. Basically what I'm saying for everyone is that **the first week is the hardest** because after that, you won't even think about cigs, and it gets so much easier at week 2.

So for everyone on week 1 and thinking about picking a cig up... **Don't!** you're already well on your way! Good luck everyone, and instead of making your new years resolution "quit smoking" make it "don't start smoking again" :)

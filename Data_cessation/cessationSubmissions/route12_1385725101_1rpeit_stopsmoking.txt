starting to reminisce about smoking.

im just a few days shy of 100 days smoke free. so far the cravings and feeling of wanting to smoke hasn't really been an issue. its actually been way easier then i imagined.

i've heard a lot about how cravings are over whelming and how its not uncommon to slip up and resume smoking again. well as i mentioned it hasnt been too hard so far. but for the past week or so i've been having this nostalgic feeling of smoking. i have these moments were i reminisce about smoking with friends, or the the times i just spent alone going for walks or just spending alone time while smoking.

its not so much that i crave the cigarettes i guess but more so the good times that were had that accompanied the cigarettes. i feel like it may have something to do with me moving around a lot during the last few years, i dont get to see my friends as much or have much free time on account of work. 

but its getting to the point where i have to tell my self that i do not need to smoke and kinda talk my self out of it. i'm just really worried that the urge will just get stronger from here on. like i mentioned i never really got these intense of cravings in the last 3 months of being smoke free.

if anyone has any tips or advice it would be great to hear, as i dont really have anyone to talk to about this issue. most just say that i've made it this far and theres no need to go back, but it really hasnt help ease my mind at all.

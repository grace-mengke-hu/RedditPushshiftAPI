I need to share my story.

* First of all I'm really sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my mother language.

So I started smoking when I was 15 years old, It was a really hard time in my life and I was diagnosed with major depression. I wanted to kill myself so I started smoking. I thought it was a way of commiting suicide and be able to stop at any time in case I changed my mind but even though I was smoking cigarettes I still tried to kill myself.

After a long time I kinda recovered from my depression. I got into college, made friends, I even got to be one of the "cool" kids who everyone wants to hangout with. And even though my life got better in so many ways I keep smoking.

I always told myself that on my 21st birthday I would quit and guess what, I turned 21 last Thursday and I'm still unable to stop smoking.

Sometimes I'm really scared that I already have some kind of desease from smoking and that really makes me want to quit but then I feel like everything is pointless and I don't really care about anything, not even about my health or my loved ones.

I've tried to quit a lot of times in a lot of different ways. I've been working out almost everyday since January and I don't feel like it takes my stress or cravings away, so I keep smoking 10+ cigarettes a day. 

I don't know what to do, every time I try to quit I end up caving. I guess that deep inside, I still want to die.

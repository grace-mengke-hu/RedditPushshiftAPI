6.5 months smoke free and started again 2 weeks ago

Today I’m quitting again.  I stupidly started again when I was on 2 weeks vacation and was drinking. I thought a couple smokes when having drinks would be fine.  Wrong. I should’ve known better, I’ve done this in the past when I quit for 1.5 years.  Sometimes I think I’ll never learn.  I hate smoking, I hate what it does to the body and how it smells, but keep going back.   Day 1 again.

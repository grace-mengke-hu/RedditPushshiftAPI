Just had a strange thought. Day 5.

I walked past someone who was smoking and briefly considered that I *could* ask to bum one... If I *wanted* to... 

But I didn't, because I'm quit. I'm done. And thought to myself that they'll always be there. Cigarettes, nicotine, tobacco- it's literally a few steps away to the nearest place to load up. I'm a fucking adult so what's stopping me? 

What's stopping me is a commitment to myself and the only body I'll ever have. If my girlfriend/boyfriend/friendfriend doesn't like that I smoke, I can find another, whatever, there's someone for everyone; my romantic idea of lounging around and chain smoking after sex is just not sexy. It's gross. I don't need it, nobody needs it. It's so not cool, it's addicting and expensive and smelly and unhealthy and screw it. I just need to remind myself why I quit.

I'm afraid that this kick of "ew! Cigarettes!" Is going to wear off though...

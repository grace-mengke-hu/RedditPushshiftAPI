12 Days

Longest I've ever gone. Feeling quite proud and determined to persevere. Directing my focus on more fulfilling aspects of life and knowing that smoking is a pointless endeavour. Sending well wishes and gratitude to everyone here, this sub, all of us working towards this together really is such an indispensable factor, with the ability to elevate our knowledge and ability to overcome this. I certainly wouldn't be where I am without these posts to occupy my shaky mind and keep my sight on the long term.

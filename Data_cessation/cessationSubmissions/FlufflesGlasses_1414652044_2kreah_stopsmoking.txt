Holy crap, I'm really doing this.

TL;DR: Numbers don't lie, man.

I've been off work because of surgery for two weeks now, and started working out my budget for next month (and by "budget", I really mean write down my rent and other bills, and say "great, I can spend this much on other crap.Good job, me.")  Tonight, however I actually took an actual crack at it, and wrote in cigarettes in as its own category to see how much I waste a month.  I've been told a million times that smoking is expensive, but I would just roll my eyes.  I figured that if I can afford my dirty habits, then what does it matter?


Well now I can't afford it.  I smoke a pack a day, which means I spend $216 on cigarettes a month! I'm certain that my usage has increased too, since I have nothing to do while off work.  So what do I do?  Soak my fresh pack of smokes in water and toss that sucker in the garbage!

I can't afford NRT currently, but I do have two adorable little kittens to get me through what I can only assume is going to be a shit first few days.

Eeeeeee!  Wish me luck!

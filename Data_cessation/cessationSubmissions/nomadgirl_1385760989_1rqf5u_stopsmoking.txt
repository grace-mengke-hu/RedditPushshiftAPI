Cleaned my car today

So I was cleaning out my car for my roadtrip next week. I found a cig underneath my drivers seat. All I can think about is smoking it. All I can think about is my yo-yo quiting from last year, pick up smoking, quit for a week or two, smoke some more. 

I have smoked since 1994. The longest I stopped was for almost 2 years from 2001-2003. 

I know I am stopping smoking for my health, god knows what kind of condition my lungs are in, and starting a new job at a hospital. Part of my stopping is willpower, I did this cold turkey, I am stronger than the nicotine, but, really want a smoke, then I know if I start back up I am yo-yo'ng again. 

I can't afford to start again since I am moving in less than a week to one of the top 10 cities in the States that have the strictest laws on the books about smoking. Its illegal to smoke outdoors strict. 

I haven't left my mom's house/been physically outside in almost 6 days since I went CT and today I go to my car to clean it out and stumble across a cigarette. I know I need to throw it out. All I can think about is just one puff and then I will be back to smoking again. Gar, grumbly :( not smoking.

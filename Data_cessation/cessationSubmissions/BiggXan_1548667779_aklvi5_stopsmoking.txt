Looking for every tip, trick, app, strategy, motivation technique, and some encouragement. Please help me quit smoking!

I've been smoking for about 12 years; I'm ready to quit! I've been putting on 7mg patches here and there, but I keep letting myself go a day without the patch to "allow" myself to go a day having some smokes. The thing is, I enjoy smoking, and for many reasons: to take a break from work, to pass the time waiting for a bus, to sit on my front step and play a few rounds of some game on my phone, after all meals, after every coffee, etc. For more context, I smoke a 20 pack/day. For my brand, and where I live, it costs me $10.85/day. The main reason for quitting is that I quit a 23 year drinking addiction 13 months ago, and I decided when I started that, that I would slowly and gradually quit all my addictions and bad habits. So with drinking under my belt, thus far, I'm ready to kick the smoking. I simply cannot justify blowing $340 a month on smokes; it's wasted money, and I'm paying for the "privilege" of voluntarily killing myself at worst, and destroying my health at best. I know I can do this, but I want a plethora of things to help me to do so. I'm in a good spot too as I've highly reduced the amount of cigarettes I smoke a day. I just need every little push I can to finally pull the trigger and just stop. So I'm asking for an army of support. This thread doesn't have to be self serving either. It could become a repository of info for any other newcomers. I've seen the power of Reddit, of what Reddit users can and have accomplished, and there is no better place I find to accomplish something like this. Please help me Reddit!

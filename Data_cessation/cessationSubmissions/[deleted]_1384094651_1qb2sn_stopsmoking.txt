Looking to quit, need help with e-cigs

I'm currently 23 and have been smoking for about 6 years and I think it's about time to quit, I've tried before but I don't have the willpower even with patches. 

I've come across e-cigs but have no idea what to buy and what the best ones are, been looking at theelectroniccigarette.co.uk. What i'm asking is what should I buy?.

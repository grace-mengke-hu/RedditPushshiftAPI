Marathon relay tomorrow

Even as a smoker, I was a runner. I would usually quit when training for a big run but the last half marathon I ran I only stopped for 2 weeks before. It was probably the worst run I have ever done and I felt awful at the end. Tomorrow is the first organised race I have entered since I quit and it is a marathon relay.  I'm up for the first leg and am really looking forward to it.  Training has been so much more enjoyable, I can actually hold a conversation while running and not be bent over out of breath at the top of the big hills. Hoping to knock a few minutes off my previous PB and think I might even sing my way through some of it!

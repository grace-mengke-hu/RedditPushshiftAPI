Don’t wanna relapse again

Hey Everybody, towards the end of last year, I read the easy way to stop smoking and felt like I made progress, for a couple of weeks didn’t smoke at all, then randomly found 2 cigerettes at my friends place, smoked both of em and went another 2 weeks without smoking, after that was struggling w university and almost got kicked outta my program. So started smoking, it’s been 7 months since I’ve been smoking cuz it’s just one thing after the other and quitting smoking wasn’t on my priority list, I feel the longer I wait to quit smoking the harder will it get. I’m 21 right now, been smoking since I was about 19. Should I read easy way again or switch to nicotine patches. Any help would be appreciated!

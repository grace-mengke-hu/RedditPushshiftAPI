2 weeks and going strong

I hit my 2 week mark about an hour ago. The last 3 days have been surprisingly easy for me. I know some people hit a rough patch at their second week so I am hoping I am not a late bloomer and that every day onward is just easier and easier.

Thanks for giving me inspiration. Seeing badges that go anywhere from 1 day to 1000 just shows another person who knows the struggle but is making it.

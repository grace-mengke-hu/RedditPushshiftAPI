Co-workers quit

I'm happy to say that everyone I work with regularly have quit since new years. The kitchen is no longer a trap. There are no packages of cigrettes all over the place and all the buts have been long cleaned up. 

It use to be really hard when quitting because during those few minutes of downtime, everyone would be handing around cigarettes and going for a 'breather'. At first we were all trying to see who would cave first. We all had drunk stumbles and talked about how nice just one would be. 

Now I feel we are all out of the thick, the scent of smoke from someone walking in from outside is a thing of the past.  Three 'pack a day' smokers probably just added 10 years to their lives.


I just thought I'd share this because misery loves company and at this moment I feel we have all gotten over it being a contest and more of a life choice. 


If these 3 cooks can do it I'm sure anyone can. Good luck on your journey guys and remember every cigrette you don't smoke you are better off.

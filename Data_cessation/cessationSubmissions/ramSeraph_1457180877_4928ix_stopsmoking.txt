A month.. I am exhausted mentally

Had been going through a lot of stress lately. I worry I will take it up again. Severe cravings over the last couple of days, mostly due to some specific unconquered associations. I feel exhausted mentally. Just feel like sleeping most of the time. But 30 days on my first ever attempt, I am proud of myself and thankful for all the people who keep telling me how proud they are of me. I would like to make this my only attempt, I will not break.

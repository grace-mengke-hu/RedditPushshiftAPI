Holy shit. I need to quit.

Yeah. That totally rhymed.

Okay. I've been trying to quit over and over. I've read Alan Carr's book and it was great and it helped. But I had stopped taking one of my medications, so I started smoking because I thought what I was feeling was from nicotine withdrawal. Nope. And I was right back up again.

I don't want to smoke. But I do. But only because cigarettes are absolutely fucking evil and are trying to kill me. 

That overwhelming sensation that you get when you quit? I fucking hate that. It's a terrible feeling. Or agitation. Or the inability to think. I have a lot of shit going on right now and I really need to be able to think. But I do know, that when I quit, my mind will be clearer than ever. It's hard to work up the momentum to three or so days of suffering despite knowing that I'll have a lifetime of freedom after. 

I'm a severe asthmatic. I suffer all the time because I need that 'sweet' puff of nicotine. Cigarettes are the fucking devil and I want to be free. I'm incredibly pissed off that I'm a smoker and that I want to be a non-smoker.

Someone give me a hint on how to give nothing up and not be so pissy about it. 

*Please and thank you.*

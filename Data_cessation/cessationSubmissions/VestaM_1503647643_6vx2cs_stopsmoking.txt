So here we go...

Hi there
I'm 21 years old guy who's started to smoke at his early 13 years and haven't been stopped since then longer than for 6 months (happened once when i decided to quit for first time a year ago). So now here i am, not smoking second day and just want to share and ask for good luck wishes, cause at least me lack of nicotine affects mentally, my mood changes every 2 seconds and i feel depressed... On that note, maybe anyone have any suggestions on how to keep at least decent mood these first days? what could help. And what about e-cigarettes ?


EDIT.
Gonna record how i feel each day of first week and then will try to update post weekly for a first month to track my progress (i think that will help me a bit to boost my confidence and self esteem).


* Day1 - It was nightmare, almost gave when i sensed smell of coffee in the morning, since it's first thing of the day i used to... I was lucky, today at work we have tons of unfinished projects so that kept me busy despite fact that i used to make "smoke brakes" every hour or two. Evening was horrible, had to go sleep early to stop urges to smoke....


* Day2 - Same as yesterday, as soon as i sense smell of fresh coffee i just wan't to light that cigarette and enjoy it, however the carving was shorter, after few minutes i almost forgot those thoughts (how good would be to light a fag). Today i'm less lucky really nothing to do at work, and instead browsing internet and trying to keep myself busy by reading, but feeling how carving reaching a peak.. Lets hope i'll keep it till the evening when i simply can go sleep.

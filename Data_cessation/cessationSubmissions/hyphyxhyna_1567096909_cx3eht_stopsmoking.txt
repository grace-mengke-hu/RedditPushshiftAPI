Really want and need to quit smoking cigarettes.

I've decided to quit smoking. My quit date is this upcoming Monday and I've decided to smoke only half the amount I normally do in a day. What I'm worried/nervous about though is what to do when I start craving a cigarette. Does anyone have any suggestions? It would be greatly appreciated. I really need to quit. Thank you in advance.

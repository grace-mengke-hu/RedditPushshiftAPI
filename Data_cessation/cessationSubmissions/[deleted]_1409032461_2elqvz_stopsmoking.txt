NRT & Mood Swings

Hi guys! I've recently quit smoking, It's been about 3 months. I am still using NRT (2mg lozenges). I'm exercising again and myself and my lungs feel great, I have no desire to go and get a pack for the first time in 7 years (15 - 22). Im proud!

I feel like I need to learn how to control my emotions better though, I'm getting angry, sad and anxious now for no reason at all and the NRT doesn't really help. I know I'm acting irrationally but I can't stop it and its scary and embarrassing. I want to have the relaxed happy persona I had before, but I definitely don't at the moment.

Maybe it's another hurdle, I hope so. I hate negativity so much and I feel like I'm embodying it. It's been dancing around in my mind that maybe I'm depressed. I don't want to jump the gun on that one though.

What do you guys think? Do I just need to ride it out?

What I know of failure

First of all, I'm no expert.  Second, this would be first, but I'm not an expert and I feel like I should say that first; the beauty of failure is that you almost always get to try again.  That's part of my attitude towards my future success as a non-smoker.  Not to say that I am going in with the assumption that I will fail.  I do know that if I cause failure, I also have the choice and power to try again.  I know I can beat this.  I've been in the game long enough to know that I am not a complete fool.  I have made many attempts to stop smoking.  I have failed as many times.  There is a possibility that I will fail again.  The odds and knowledge of the old me indicate that it's more like a strong probability.  Before long, smoking or not will no longer be my choice.  If I'm going to be a victim of failure, I would rather go down fighting.  In the past, failure has been a demon, a phantom entity always one step ahead of me.  I see it now as a real form that I can battle against.  **insert training/equipment montage**  Last one alive, lock the door!  tl/dr; I'll be a rugged, war-tired cunt if I ever get to the point where I don't get to try again.

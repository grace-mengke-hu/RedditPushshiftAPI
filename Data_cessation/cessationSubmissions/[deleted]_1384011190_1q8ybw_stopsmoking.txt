Strong coughing since I stopped

I stopped smoking 1 or 2 weeks ago (depends if you count in the 6 cigarettes I smoked last sunday) and since then I started to cough out much sputum (especially in the morning). Can anyone confirm that this is normal, because I'm fearing that it might be something serious.

Note: I'm 21 and smoked for 2-3 years before, around 2-5 cigarettes a day. 3 weeks ago I've been on vacation with friends and smoked around one pack a day for 5 days. I was perfectly fine while I smoked and only started to cough as soon as I stopped.

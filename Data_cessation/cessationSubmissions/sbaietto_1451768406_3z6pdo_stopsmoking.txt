I'm slipping up

The insomnia and stress was killing me. I watched an hour long movie over and over again summarizing Allen Carr's book. I just picked up a copy from the library about an hour ago too. I'm considering getting some nicotine gum to help cope with not being able to sleep and being very irritable. I was fine for two days but it seem like my husband was just getting on my nerves so much that I could hardly stand him anymore. I feel bad for being so crabby towards him. I smoked one cigarette and felt pretty horrible then about an hour later I smoked another one. 
Vaping seems to hurt my lungs so I don't want to do that. It's not the act of smoking that I miss at all. I know it's purely withdrawal from nicotine addiction.

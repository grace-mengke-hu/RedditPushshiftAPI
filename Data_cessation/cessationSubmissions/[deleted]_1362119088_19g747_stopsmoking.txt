Panic attack when quit smoking

I've been smoking since I was 18 years old. Now, I'm 31 and my body is ready to quit. A couple of months ago, I just quit. Didn't feel any need to smoke. It was OK for a couple of days, but suddenly, anxiety began to raise... and there was a panick attack.I can tell you that it's the most terrorific feel that any human can have. 

At the moment, I couldn't make the conection; but lately I just ligth a cigarrette and felt sligthly better, then another one...and I was perfect. I'm still smoking, less than before, but smoking. 

Does anyone have feel something like this? :( anxiety is terrible, can't work, not even leave my home. Don't want to take any pill o nicotine sustitute (besides, in my country those are pretty difficult to find)... do you have any advice? :( I feel that I'm killing me slowly

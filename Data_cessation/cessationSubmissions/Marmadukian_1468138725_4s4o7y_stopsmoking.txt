[160 days] - I had a wisdom tooth removed today and I'm having difficulty not vaping, patch is doing an okay job, but I'm having a really hard time falling asleep.

I had the tooth removed around 1020am, and then the procedure was done in about 20 minutes. Afterwards, they told me no smoking, and I asked about vaping, which he said not to do either, nor drinking through a straw. It's the negative pressure that can cause dry socket, or something. It's where the clot gets dislodged, and is extremely painful, so I've made it to 2am now, but fuck, is it hard to get to sleep. 

I dunno what I can try, I normally just have a drink or two if I'm having trouble sleeping, but that's out of the picture too, although four different reasons. 

I guess I just have a few questions for solutions I found online.

Are nicotine lozenges okay as long as I don't suck? What about not making a full seal on the vape and drawing like I'm just breathing normally? Would putting gauze over the socket really prevent the clot from moving? Would gauze tear the clot out when removing the gauze? If I do have a drink, and limit it to one, would it result in another day of no vaping so it can heal more? 

I'm really afraid of that dry socket thing(which I'm not even sure I'm remembering the name right).

Edit: also the dental assistant gave me like 30-40 gauze squares, and I was to use 2 every 30 minutes for 2-4 hours, it seems excessive, like she wasn't allowed to suggest the putting gauze in to vape for a bit.

Edit part two: dry socket! Not empty socket.

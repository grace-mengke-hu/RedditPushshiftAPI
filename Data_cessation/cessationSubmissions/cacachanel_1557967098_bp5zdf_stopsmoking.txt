Hi, do you think it will be easier for me to stop since I've been smoking for "only" 2 months?

I must say I smoked a lot during this period. There were a few days I smoked 0 and others in which I smoked a pack. I'd say 13 CPD, on average.

Does the duration mean I'll have an easier time withdrawing or that isn't the case? 

I stopped today and damn cravings are really strong, right? I use cocaine occasionally and a few times and crossed the line a few times, doing cocaine almost every day for like 2 weeks. I had cravings, but they were nothing compared to this. They were merely annoying and I could ignore them with a little effort. Now, the cravings I'm having now, I feel really cold and I totally lose my sanity. 

Ah, this is day one. I promised I wouldn't give in to cravings but I just did (three puffs), which I know is obviously not acceptable and no less harmful than if I just smoked a whole cig. Fortunately, I guess, my smoker neighbor just asked me if I had cigarettes. I handed my last pack to her, so now I'll have to do the walk of shame to go and buy if I surrender to my cravings.

Anyway, sorry for my deplorable English. I think posting here and talking to people going through the same thing as I am will help. I know the worst days are yet to come, and I'm scared.

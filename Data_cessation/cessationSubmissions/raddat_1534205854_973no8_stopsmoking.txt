Addicted to Nicorette Icy Mint for 5yrs. Tried transitioning to regular gum, failed. Looking for suggestions on similar-tasting gum without the nicotine in it!

As per the title - my main issue with switching to regular gum is it didn't taste like the Nicorette, and so my theory is that if I find something that tastes similar, the transition would be easier, and I could use them as a better placebo.

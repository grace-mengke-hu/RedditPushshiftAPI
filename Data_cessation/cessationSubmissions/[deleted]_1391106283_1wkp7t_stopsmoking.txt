Not sure where to start...

I'm 20 years old, and have only been habitually smoking since I was 19. Just about 2 years considering I'm about to turn 21. I've got a heart condition called A-Fib (atrial fibrillation), and cigarettes have been progressively making it worse. I have nearly-intense pains more often now as opposed to when I strayed. Still, knowing all this...

I can't quit.

I've never, EVER had a problem with stopping for 2-3 weeks at a time. Wouldn't have urges, or irritability, but all it takes is bumming one smoke and I'm back to a pack a day. Sometimes I'll chief more than a pack a day.

I KNOW that I won't see 25 if I keep it up because of my heart. There are no other factors. I'm not extremely overweight, extremely unhealthy. The cigarettes are the devils lettuce in my case. I've stopped drinking even so, just to narrow it down.

I've never been the kind to take to public forum, but I figured I could take some advice or kind words for a community driven by quitting.

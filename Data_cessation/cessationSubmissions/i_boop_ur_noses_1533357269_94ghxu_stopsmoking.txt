Everything that can go wrong, went wrong BUT I WON!

5 days you guys! After smoking a pack a day for 6 years and multiple failed attempts.
Infact in very freaking coincidence, all trigger situations that got me hooked and kept me hooked so long, happened exactly thr next day I quit, AGAIN. 
I could give my self a damn medal for being so strong for myself this time. I did cry, a lot. Everyday, about everything. But I was very aware this time that cig or without cig, those triggrrs hurt the same! Equally painful so whats even the use of cig except that it will help the nicotine withdrawal monster in me. I cried, sulked, whined, got high, ate my favorite comfort food and kept myself busy. I did it.
Everyone isn't joking guys! It does get easy, do it now. It's nothing,it has no advantages, every smoker wishes to quit, remember! Let's do this together
I know this is it. Never again!

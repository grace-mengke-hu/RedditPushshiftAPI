Everyone's A Winner!

In the first 10 days of my quit I have saved $US 150 (cigarettes are expensive here in Australia). Yesterday to celebrate this achievement I purchased the complete 5 seasons of "The Wire" on DVD for $90 and the remaining $60 I donated to my favorite charity......everyone's a winner!

Just past a year.

This is a pretty major milestone in my quit, and I'm doing great. I'm the healthiest I have ever been in my whole life and I now feel like I can do anything I put my mind to.

 I just want to say:

1) As time goes on, it gets easier and easier until it's almost effortless.

2) The long term benefits of quitting far outweigh the short term enjoyment of smoking.

3) Recognize that you are an addict and that your mind does work well when it comes to the substance (nicotine) you are addicted to. Don't let yourself romanticize smoking. You need to have control over your thoughts. Trust yourself that smoking is in fact not worthwhile and that you can overcome those cravings.

 Good luck everyone.

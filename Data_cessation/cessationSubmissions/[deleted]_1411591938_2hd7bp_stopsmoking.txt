In 5 hours, I will be smoke free for 1 month.

  After trying shit load of times, I finally reached the 1 month mark. I will move on. I only craved 4 times in a month and they were when I was out with heavy-smoker friends drinking alcohol in a pub, etc. I got pissed drunk and didn't even smoke one. 
 
 I changed my mind about cigarettes. It was a weird realization point. It was simple. This little evil stick is just poison makes you an addict, steals your money, harms your soul and body slowly so you don't realize until you are totally screwed up. Also it wears a mask to show itself beautiful by using media, movies, celebrities, the hot chick next door, the handsome dude at school and other crap. It tries to get in your mind in any way you can't even imagine. 
 
 Just calm down for a minute, forget your past, forget what you saw in your life, remove all of your memories and imagine yourself in a huge forest and finding a little bottle that says "do not drink, it will harm & kill you" on it. What would you do? Please tell me with all your conviction, would you drink it or throw it away? Well, the reason you can not see cigarettes in this state is the image that is created for cigarettes. The brands, the history, media, movies. Cigarettes were there before you were born so you see it as a normal thing to exist. But it is not. SIMPLE, It is just a tool to fuck you up. 

When you really realize what a cigarette is, you can see it in a different way. The smell will annoy you so much. You will look at people in a weird way, you won't understand how a smart person can do this to him/herself. 1 month for the best motivation, I will keep going. Next goal is 3 months.

P.S: Do not mind my badge, I forgot to reset it back in time. ( It also reminds me what I would achieve if I didn't relapse)

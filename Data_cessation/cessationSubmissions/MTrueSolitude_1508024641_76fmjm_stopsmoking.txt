48 hours

I completed a total of 48 hours smoke free. I feel great, the cravings however are brutal. I know each individual is different but when would you say the cravings begin to become more manageable. (if that's even the right word.) 

I read Allen Carr's EasyWay and i finished it in 1 day. When I woke up the next morning, I had no cravings and I didn't smoke all that day. I was elated like the book mentioned, however. It's the day after that the cravings started getting me.....

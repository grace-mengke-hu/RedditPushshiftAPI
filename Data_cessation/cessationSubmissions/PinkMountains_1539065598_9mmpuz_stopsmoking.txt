I went to a music festival

And I didn’t smoke. In the past, I’ve smoked packs and packs. It’s an outside festival for 3 days. I was slightly worried it would be wildly triggering, but it wasn’t. I felt like it was a tiny poke, but never a true craving. 

After this, I feel like I can do anything. Seriously, hang in there. You’ll get there faster than you think!

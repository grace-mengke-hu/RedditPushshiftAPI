2 weeks into beating my strange and terrible habit.

I quit smoking cold turkey on the 6th of Febuary, and have been smoke free for 14 days. I started smoking 3 years ago, and after getting hooked on casual cigarettes I started smoking tobacco out of my bong. I did this every day for about 2 years, nearly three times every five minutes. This deteriorated my health very quickly and once my hair started coming out in chunks was when I decided it was time to quit. After just 2 weeks I can breathe, taste and smell again. My skin is less pale and my hair has stopped falling out. It's still very rough and I've been having mental cravings but if I can quit anyone can. Fuck nicotine.

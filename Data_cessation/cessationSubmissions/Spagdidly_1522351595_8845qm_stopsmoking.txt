Question for those who weened themselves off

I've gone from a pack a day to 4 or 5 a day over the last few weeks, and I could easily make that 1 or 2 a day, but I'm just a shit head sometimes. 

So my question is for anybody who gradually cut back to zero over time, when you got to 1 or 2 a day, did you ever "forget" about smoking? Like were there ever days where you only realized you hadn't smoked all day at like 5pm? Or were you still pretty aware that you wanted to smoke and couldn't?

I ask because it's been relatively easy to cut back, but to completely cut them out is just miserable, and I can't do it right now.

Thanks

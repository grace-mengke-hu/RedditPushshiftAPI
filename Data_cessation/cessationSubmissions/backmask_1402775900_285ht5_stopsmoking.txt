Quitting in the next couple days

I need to do this. I've smoked since I was 12 or 13, and am now 29. I've given so many thousands of dollars to this destructive shit, and have harmed my body in doing so. When I was 17 I had bone cancer, and did chemo for a year. So between chemo and smoking, I've partaken heavily in the two most common causes of cancer.

I'm tired of being winded when I walk up a flight of stairs. I'm tired of getting a common cold that last 10 times longer than normal because I choose to smoke.

I'm terrified of getting cancer again, and to fight off that fear I fall back on what has been 'Ol Faithful: Cigarettes (I've always noted the irony in my very first thought when I was told that I had cancer when I was 17- "I need a cigarette").

If you're the praying type, please intercede for me. I have to do this now. I have an 11 month old son, and the example I'm setting for him is mentally destroying me.

Thanks for listening to me rant. I went to the doctor for this cold that I'm fighting off and asked him for help. To start, he's prescribed me patches, and also gave me Lorazepam to help with my anxiety. I'm mentally going through and trying to find the best quit date, which I think will either be Monday or Tuesday. I really want to be done with all of this.

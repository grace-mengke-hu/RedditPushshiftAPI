Rogue cravings!! Be careful

So I’m well past 5 months quit, but recently have had some big time cravings (Like right now!) It just makes me realize that this is a lifelong battle and I need to stay vigilant. I often feel the urge to go to the store and buy a pack, but then I think about how awful that would taste and feel. It’s crazy to be addicted to something that is gross and hurts. I mean....who gets addicted to colonoscopies? NOBODY!!!

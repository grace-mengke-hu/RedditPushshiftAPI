Question about quitting using Allen Carr book if I'd already started quitting with patches.

Would really appreciate any advice because I'm having a bit of a hard time right now. I quit smoking on Saturday using patches. Knowing that patches hadn't worked in the past (and after being a right arse to the people around me) thought I'd take a look at Allen Carr's book. As you probably know, he advocates smoking until you finish the book unless you already have. I know he's firmly against substitutes so if I go through with his method I'll stop using them. But for the meantime, do you think I should keep going with the patches until I finish the book? Or not bother with the patches, smoke until I finish the book and then chuck them? 

I guess you might say I'm looking for an excuse to smoke. But at the same time I'm finding it very hard to appreciate what he's saying whilst I feel like I'm suffering these withdrawl symptoms (real or not). 

Any other resources greatly appreciated - I'm determined to quit but feeling a bit weak right now!

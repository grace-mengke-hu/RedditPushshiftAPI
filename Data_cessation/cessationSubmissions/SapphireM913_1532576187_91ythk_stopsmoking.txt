Try #9 (ugh)

I saw my doctor yesterday. I admitted that for the past two years I hadn't really been trying to quit. I actually started trying on 5/9 this year. I have failed 8 times. She told me it takes on average 10-12 tried before you're successful. She gave me a prescription for lozenges and patches. I had set my quit date for 8/1 before I saw her.

I'm an overachiever. In EVERYTHING. If it takes the average person 10-12 tries, I'm gonna do it in 9. Plus 9 is my lucky number. 

I hate myself for this. Starting smoking was the biggest mistake I've ever made, and that includes marrying an alcoholic because "maybe he'd change for me". I wish every day I could look a youngster in the eye and tell them that. Please, put it down, walk away, turn around before it's too late.

I vent here because I'm a closet smoker, no replies necessary.

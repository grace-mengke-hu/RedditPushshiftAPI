Day 4 and I'm about to spend many hours without my e-cig.

So, rn I'm in the bus, on my way to visit some relatives. I let my e-cig charge overnight, like an idiot, Since I wasn't there to watch it like a hawk, my cat took the chance to finally finish off the charger. My e-cig just ran out of battery. Help. My mom's immediate, helpful suggestion: "I'll get you some some cigarettes as son as we get there". I said no and I hope my resolve will last. I'm going to try and borrow a charger there, hopefully I'll find one and I'm panicking for no reason. I am panicking, though. Help.

PS Excuse my typos, I'm too blind to post on my phone.

Edit: I'm an idiot. I started panicking because soon after I ran out of battery, I started feeling really, really bad and I thought it was nicotine withdrawal but it wasn't. It was motion sickness. I only started getting it very recently and I keep forgetting I do. Also, I managed to charge the e-cig a bit, anyway. I charged it in the kiosk where I used to buy cigarettes. :P

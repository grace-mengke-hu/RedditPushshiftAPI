Still need some support. Not a complete failure?

First off, I want to thank EVERYONE for all the support this sub has provided. Its been a crazy week and I've received a lot of good advice and techniques to stop smoking 

Here's my progress this far. After being a pack a day smoker for 10 yrs I have cut back this wk smoking a total of 2 1 /2 cigs total ( day 5 1/2 cig, day 8 1 and 1/2 cig .)  Went cold turkey. I'm more angry at myself for breaking down over stupid stuff like being drunk and smoking with friends while trucking through the really hard day's 1-3. 

Trying to stay positive but reminding myself and everyone as long as you stay focused you can succeed. We will succeed! DO NOT GIVE UP! Remind yourself you are a non smoker now. Been getting a lot of support from my smoker friends too. 

What has personally worked for me... Remind yourself why you are quitting, know the cravings will pass, taking a walk during smoke break is doing me wonders, actually go enjoy fresh air outside, no cigarette is better than another; they all are equally terrible, take DEEP BREATHS! 

I'm gonna reset my badge and still a little upset at myself. :/

Why did I wait to tell my friends about quitting?!

With my friends and family, I've been pretty quiet/secretive about quitting because it has felt... embarrassing? dorky? like it's not a big deal because it's only been 2 1/2 days? Anyone else feel those little pangs of shame?

Today I finally got over it and told my friends. I feel so lucky to have the best pals ever! **Note to selves:** build a support system because (a) it's a great feeling and (b) helloooo accountability!

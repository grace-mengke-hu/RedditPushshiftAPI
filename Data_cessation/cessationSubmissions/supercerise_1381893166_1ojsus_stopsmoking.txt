Champix Side Effects - Acne?

I quit smoking 2 weeks ago with the help of Champix. I stopped taking the Champix about a week after quitting as I was having weird mood swings (I was warned about this potential) and was quite nauseous as well. Since I stopped taking it, my face has broken out terribly. Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions on clearing up my nightmare of a face?

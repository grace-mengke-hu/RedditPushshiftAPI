You really do help change lives

This is my 4th attempt to quit now, after smoking a pack and a half a day for 6 years. I read people's "I quit" posts here everyday to stay encouraged. Today's my 11th day and I was craving HARD because of other life stuff, so instead of wallowing in my own misery I decided to go for a run. I lasted for 30 min with my heart pumping hard !

I don't remember the last time I ran more than 10 min without hacking up a lung. I'm going to make this a daily thing, I could stand do lose a few kgs as well. You don't understand how great I feel right now, it really is a small milestone for me. Thank you /r/stopsmoking. 

I encourage any lurkers around here to take this community very seriously, as everyone here is ready to help anyone here.

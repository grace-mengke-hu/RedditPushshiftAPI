The elephant in the room: Masochistic smoking.

It's not something I've seen talked about yet so maybe it's just me but I can't believe I'm the only one who has thought this. The desire to smoke out of a masochistic need to self flagellate brought on by a moment of self loathing. 
I've identified it as one of my triggers and was aware of it when I used to smoke. Could this be a reason why some find it so much harder to quit?

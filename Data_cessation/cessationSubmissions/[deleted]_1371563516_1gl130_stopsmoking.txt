My Hubby Is Joining Me!

My husband has been a long time smoker, though not as long as I have despite being older. When he saw how sick quitting made me in the first few days, and how I powered through the negative side effects, plus lost his smoking buddy, he decided to quit as well. 

While I went cold turkey, he doesn't want to do that, which is fine. He has been cutting down, and we ordered a new starter kit from a e-cig place we used to go through (we used them for about six months when they were first on the market, since I got a free double kit from a company I did some work for). 

I am proud of him. :D

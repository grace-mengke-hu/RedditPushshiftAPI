13 months and I still dream about smoking

Last night I was having dinner with friends and they asked if I missed smoking at all. I told them that while I felt good in my current headspace, a part of me will always consider myself a smoker and it’s one day at a time. 

That night I had a dream where I smoked 3 cigarettes. I was so upset with myself. I remember thinking ‘what’s the point? Why did I just do that?’

You can’t imagine how relieved I was when I woke up!

Even though smoking is no part of my life and I don’t get cravings (although I sometimes miss it), they still appear in my dreams. Does anyone have the same thing?

Victory in the Little Things

Almost four weeks in I am surrounded by constant temptation. Most of my friends smoke, I miss the breaks in work, I miss the last cigarette of the day on the steps of my back porch in the cool and quiet darkness.   

But every day I am encouraged by finding victory in the little things. There is far more room in my pockets because I'm not carrying around a pack and a lighter. I don't have to immediately put away my jacket when I get home for fear of it stinking up the house. I don't have to stand outside in the pissing rain to satisfy a craving. After nights out, hangovers aside, I don't wake up with nicotine residue inside my nostrils or coughing up a lung. I have more money for random crap.  

The little things keep me ticking over day to day.  
Sometimes the big picture scares me, and the thought of never having a cigarette again is a lot to deal with but about a week ago I took a deep breath and it was like my very first. I knew that smoking was affecting my lungs, but I didn't realise how shallow they had gotten until I quit.  

I've started to run, for the first time in my life, and though the big picture is still scary, I know that I can do it if I focus on the little things. And I know that you can too.

Day 10 still having chest pain

So today is day 10 for me and I'm still experiencing chest pain when I exercise.  I have run 2+ miles every day since I quit but still can't seem to get rid of that deep chest pain when I starting breathing hard.  Are my lungs still healing? Has anybody else experienced this issue? How long until this pain goes away?

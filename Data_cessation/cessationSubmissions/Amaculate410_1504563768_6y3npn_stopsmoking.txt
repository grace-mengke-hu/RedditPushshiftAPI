Two weeks!

I can't really believe I've got this far. I crave pretty hard everyday and sometimes I plot my relapse. The relapse plans are elaborate, so much so that I get a laugh out of them after I snap out of it. I still miss smoking though, I can see and feel the benefits and it's amazing. But the cigs and I still haven't officially broken up yet. I might read Allen Carr's book.

For now I'll just keep on keepin on.

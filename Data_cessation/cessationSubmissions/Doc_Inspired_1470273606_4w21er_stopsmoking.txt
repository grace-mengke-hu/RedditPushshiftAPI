Starting 24hr patch at night?

So, I know the box says to put it on in the AM.  I've tried this a couple of times now and had limited success - my biggest hurdle being the morning craving.  I know the concern is having vivid dreams or whatever, is there anything else to be concerned about?  

My hope is that if I smoke my last cigarette tonight, put the patch on and go to bed then I might have a better shot at making it through the morning.

I would love to hear about your experiences (aside from those NRT haters - you do what you have to do).

Thank you.

Depression after quitting

I haven't read anything about how quitting impacts you mentally, but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced depression after quitting. I'm on week four and I don't really have much for cravings anymore but I've fallen into a fairly bad depression. I figured it was probably linked to not being able to smoke when I get stressed at work, I basically just replaced it with crying instead.

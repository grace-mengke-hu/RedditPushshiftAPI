Quitting AGAIN

I was a pack a day smoker for over twenty years.  I quit for ten days and bought a pack yesterday.  Smoked a few yesterday but today I felt like I was going to be back at a pack a day in no time.  I think a part of me thought maybe I could be a light smoker.  Just threw the rest of the pack away and am starting over again.   Don't quit quitting will be my motto!

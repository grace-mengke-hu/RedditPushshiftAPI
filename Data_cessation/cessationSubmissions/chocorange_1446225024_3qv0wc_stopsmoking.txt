Unexpected trigger - Dale Gribble on King of the Hill

I'm very happy being a non-smoker. I see smokers pretty much daily but it doesn't make me feel like smoking myself and if I get a whiff of smoke I find it somewhere in between unpleasant and disgusting. Lately I've been watching a lot of King of the Hill and sometimes when I see Dale Gribble smoke it makes me feel like having one myself. It's not a big deal, the urge passes in a minute and I'm not worried about it becoming any more than that. I just thought I'd share what I feel like is a bit of an unusual trigger. Maybe some others have some unusual tales to tell?

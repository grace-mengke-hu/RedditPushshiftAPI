Wow

This is the first time I've gone on here in a few weeks and seeing the number 46 next to my name feels amazing.  I can't believe it's been that long!  I really hardly even think about smoking anymore, even when I'm drinking.  Thanks for your help and support everybody, I really don't think I'll ever smoke a cigarette again!

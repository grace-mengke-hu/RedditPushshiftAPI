Two and a half months of freedom, story if ups and downs.

So exactly 73 days to this hour, I decides to quit smoking/vaping nicotine. I'm not sure what came over me. I think I just grew tired of having an addiction. Everywhere I went, there was a need to carry nicotine, either cigarettes or e-liquid. Any family gathering, business event, or general social outing, had the concern of where, and when, I could smoke. Any engagement with others felt like a trial in patience as I waited a socially justifiable amount of time to "step out for a second", before returning to continue the cycle.

The first few days were extremely difficult, especially day three. I went absolutely bonkers. I can't describe in detail what happened. Essentially, I was asleep while awake. Very very weird feeling. But, it was traumatic enough that I realized how much of an affect cigarettes had on my psyche, and my paycheck.

The first month, the "fog" was prevalent. The days bled together. Conversation was very difficult to hold onto, and I slept _a lot_. Which was a good thing. My constant smoking made me very anxious, and ruined my sleep. Now, I'm clear headed at work, and can focus intensely, never taking breaks every 20 minutes.

After 50 days, I completely lost track of my cravings. I'm now free from the shackles of nicotine dependence. There is no "disgust" towards smokers as I did in the beginning, but there remains a deep seated concern for the act. I wish those still attempting to quit all the best. As of today I have saved $900.

My best piece of advice I can give to those trying to quit is to stay busy. It's never easy. After day five or six, go back to work. You'll suffer. But suffering is easier with distractions. If you attempt to stay in your bed all day, you'll never learn to adapt to living a life without cigarettes. You must reintegrate. Think of the physical and mental pain as a necessary, not a detriment.

An unexpected (positive!) side effect of quitting smoking!

This may be a little more inspirational to the ladies, but, my fingernails are growing at a MUCH higher speed! And of course they are whiter and brighter. My nails haven't been this long in years!! 

Not to mention I smell better, look better, and feel better. Smoke-free lungs feel truly beautiful.

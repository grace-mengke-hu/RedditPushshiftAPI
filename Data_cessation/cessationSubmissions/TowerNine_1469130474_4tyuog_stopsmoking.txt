Quitting today because of what I hope is a swollen lymph node.

I noticed the other day that there was a strange bump in my body, pretty much where my chin and throat meet. It's not perfectly centered, it's off to my right a bit, and it's not quite as big as a marble. It doesn't hurt or anything and after researching I'm hoping it's just a swollen lymph node, but it's scary enough to make me quit.

Has anyone else had a similar issue? Is anyone able to reassure me that it's probably not a tumor or anything..? I'm still freaking out..

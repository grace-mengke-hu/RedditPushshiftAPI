Quitting smoking starting today

I am 18 years old and have been smoking about half a pack to a pack a day for 3-4 years, on and off (I know, I started way too young). I haven't ever really had withdrawals when I've tried to quit in the past, but I always go back to smoking for some reason. Almost all the people I spend time with smoke so I think that is a HUGE trigger, it is just kind of a social thing for me it seems. I have high social anxiety and just high anxiety in general, and smoking usually helps me calm down and relieve stress or break the ice in awkward social situations. I am also quitting drinking, which I have been doing for about the same amount of time I've been smoking (I was not a smart preteen/teen). Any help or advice or tips or anything really would be greatly appreciated. I am on a journey to getting healthier by exercising more and eating better, and I think quitting will be a big step in helping me be a healthier individual. 

Also on a side note, what damage do you think I have done to my body/skin, and how can I reverse that, and prevent weight gain from quitting smoking?

Leaving the sub, but for positive reasons

I'm done with /r/stopsmoking, but it is because I have been smoke-free for well over a year now and I have no concerns with relapsing.  Also, I have not contributed anything to the sub for quite some time so I feel like it simply is "time".

Good luck to everyone and keep going!  Believe in yourself, regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past.  You can fail many many times but all it takes to succeed is just that one time!

Good luck!

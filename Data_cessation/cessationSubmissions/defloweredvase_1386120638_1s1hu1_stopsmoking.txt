Only thing that keeps me from breaking on my 5th day are the dark lines under my finger nails.

 Brain is coming up with such pitiful excuses to smoke yet they seem so reasonable. All I have to do is look at my fingernails and I can beat the craving. I started this quit when I read that dark vertical lines under the fingernails could mean cancer (thanks WebMD, everything is cancer). I felt such a scary sinking feeling from this imagined diagnosis of cancer. I decided then that I never wanted to experience the real thing. For all I know I really do have cancer. Since I have no health insurance I can't get checked. I'll definitely use my new health insurance on the 1st of Jan though, thanks Obama! #thingsthatkeepmequit

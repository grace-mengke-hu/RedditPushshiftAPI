25 days and counting!!

I’ve been smoke free for 25 days now and it’s getting easier and easier each day. I never thought I’d be able to do this. 

For anyone thinking about quitting, DO IT! I think the thing that worked for me this time is that I didn’t tell anyone ahead of time I was quitting. I waited a week before I let anyone know I had quit. For me, the pressure of not letting people down often caused me to relapse. This time, that pressure wasn’t there. I didn’t have anyone to disappoint other than myself. Odd, but it worked for me. Now that people know, I’m telling myself it’s about me, not them, and it’s working. 

Just thought I’d share a tip since it’s helped me out. 

Cheers!

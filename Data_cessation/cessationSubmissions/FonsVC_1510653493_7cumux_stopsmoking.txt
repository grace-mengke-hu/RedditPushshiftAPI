One week in

So I'm currently sitting at 8 days and I actually believe this is different from all the other times I've tried to quit.
It feels like something has "clicked" in my head but I can't really explain what that is.

I rarely get cravings and when I do, they really don't last that long.
But most of all, I've made it through the weekend. Something I thought would be a lot harder...

I'm feeling very confident that I'll make it. I know that I've got a long way to go so I'm trying not to become overly confident. But hey, i feel like a good beginning is something to be proud of!

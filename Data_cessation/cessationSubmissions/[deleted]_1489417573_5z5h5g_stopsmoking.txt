Close Call at the Gas Station... TWICE...

This morning, my fuel light went on and since we're getting a blizzard tomorrow, I needed to fill the tank.  Immediately, my brain went, "AND GET CIGARETTES, TOOOOO!!!"... you know, because I'll be snowed in and it would be fun to be huddled out on my porch all day in sub zero temps to smoke, right?... Right?

I first attempted to stop at the gas station down the street and there was a tanker truck delivering fuel which blocked one entrance and all the customers were parked at the other entrance and I couldn't get in.  Okay, next...

The entire time I'm driving to the second gas station, I'm arguing with myself... I pulled into the gas station and avoided going in to pay... I used my debit card at the pump, got my gas and got the eff out of there... I wanted juice and snacks for work, but I didn't trust myself to go in... 

This is getting exhausting... I'm so glad we're getting a blizzard because everything will be closed and tomorrow will be so much easier... unfortunately, I have to stop at the market tonight and I need to avoid the cigarettes there, too... Just ugh...

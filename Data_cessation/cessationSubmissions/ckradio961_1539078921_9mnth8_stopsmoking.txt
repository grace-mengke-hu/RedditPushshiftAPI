Here’s your silver bullet...

Exercise is key. I didn’t believe it the first couple/few months, but I was wrong. I felt terrible a month, two, even three-ish months into quitting. Mentally and physically horrible.

Now? I exercise 30-60 minutes a pop, 5 times a week. What a WORLD of difference. It makes it all much, much easier, promise!

Believe the hype!

8 1/2 months in

I quit smoking January 3rd of this year when I found out I was pregnant. 
I haven't had a single cigarette since. But I think about them constantly. I would love to have a cigarette. I miss the slow inhale. I miss the burn and the exhale of smoke. I miss sitting in my car after a stressful day and having a cigarette before going inside. 

I've managed to shove the cravings down and ignore them. After all I'm 37 weeks pregnant with my daughter. But I have no idea how I'm going to continue to be a non smoker after I have her. 

I want to tell myself I'll resist because it would be dumb to relapse after a good part of a year. 

But truthfully I don't know how I'll stay smoke free. 

I didn't think it would still be a near constant thought this long after I quit. 

It's really just the drive home after a long day and during my 2 year old sons tantrums that the craving nearly cripples me. 

I just didn't know it would be this hard for so long.

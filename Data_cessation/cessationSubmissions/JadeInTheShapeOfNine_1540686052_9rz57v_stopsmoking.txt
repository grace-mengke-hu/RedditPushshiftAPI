Home stress got to me. Almost caved in...

But I bought fries and coffee instead after leaving the house in a huff. But no puff! 

I was this close. Literally across the street from the gas station opted for the restaurant. And although I am for sure getting heart burn and GERD for the next week. My wallet IS lighter regardless... I am glad I am still a non smoker :) 

Following my own advice. It is hard AF and I’m mad but the smokes can’t help and won’t help me. And would cause more stress in the end. Find an alternative. A healthy alternative. Fries are mine. Might be borderline unhealthy but for someone who never eats fries (mentioned the GERD) I am treating myself to ease the hard crave and now working on the mental process and how I came to this ...

Anyways that’s work for me to do hope y’all are having a good night and staying quit too!!

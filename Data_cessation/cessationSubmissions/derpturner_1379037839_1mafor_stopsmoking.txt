End of day 2, quit cold turkey. Oh my god I'm going insane.

I just want to rage at the world, tear something down, scream. I've smoked about a pack a day for 16 years and I've quit for short periods before but I never remembered it being this bad to quit. I'm fidgeting in my seat, legs bouncing up and down, almost sweating. Fuuuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkkk. Thanks for listening.

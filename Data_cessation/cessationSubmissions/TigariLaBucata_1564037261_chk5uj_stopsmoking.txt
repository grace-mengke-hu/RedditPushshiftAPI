I really can't shake this habit. Need some advice.

Or I don't want to. Either way, there's a part of me that understands all the bad consequences of smoking and I still do it.

I'll give you some background story. I'm 29, both my parents smoke, and I've been smoking since I was 12 or 13. Nowadays I smoke around a pack a day (sometimes even more) and my favorite time of the day for smoking is in the morning.

I set my mind sometimes to lose the cigarettes but then my scumbag brain comes with various alternatives (i.e. finish this pack and then you'll quit or just smoke this morning and then you'll quit).

Thing is, I have a lot of free time right now since I'm in between jobs living with my parents and my state of mind has some mood swings almost every day. So when I have some sort of depression moment I just say fuck it and light up another one.

I'm basically just asking you guys what worked for you or if you have some good advice maybe it will work for me.

Thanks a lot and congrats to all the smokers who've managed to quit.

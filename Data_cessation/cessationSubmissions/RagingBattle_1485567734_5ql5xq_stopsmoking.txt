Hope it won't be like a virgin by Madonna

I was a smoker, seven years of puffing without thinking about all the consequences. I was destroying myself, I realized that when I choose to quit cold turkey the second of december last year. Almost two months went by, 'til something snapped in my life and decided I was too comfortable, so stress has been added to make things more interesting. Did not relapsed because of a craving, but on purpose, I thought it would have eased the pain (ahahah, no, hell no). I found out my weak side is when I'm studying or working on something and hunger starts building up, so I'm going to buy a lot of food and I'm gonna eat like a beast. God blessed me with a skinny body, at least that's not a problem.

The title is because I really hope I don't get the quitter's flu again and that it won't be painful as much as the first time. Being serious for a second, we got to remember that when a man knows the right choice and decide (because we CAN decide) on purpose to choose the bad ones...well, it's not what a true man should do. Never give up my friends. I tasted the good life in this two months and I'm not going to throw my future in the garbage again. Cheers!

edit: I wrote something that may discourage someone who's not in shape. I'm an atheist, it's not God who has blessed me, it's not something that fell from the sky. I workout every week and eat healty food. That sentence was just irony, if you are overweight, well, that's a choice too, like smoking. Quit everything that's working against you and become the person you deserve to be.

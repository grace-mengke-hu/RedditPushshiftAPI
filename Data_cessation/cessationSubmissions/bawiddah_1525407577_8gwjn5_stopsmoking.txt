6+ months but still strong, random cravings

6 months ago I stopped smoking. It was my third attempt at quitting. At one point I'd gone 3 years without a cigarette. At another point at least over a year. And now it's 6 months into my next attempt. All I can think about is how there's a convenience store within driving distance. Last night I bought a pack. And tonight I could buy another. These cravings take over nearly all my thoughts. They often occur with drinking. I should probably stop the one to prevent the other. But damn....

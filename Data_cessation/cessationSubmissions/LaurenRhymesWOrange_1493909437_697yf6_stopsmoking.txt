26 F. Daily Smoker for 7 years. Day One nicotine free today!

Yep, I'm going for it. I've lurked in this sub a while.

I'm 26 years old and I've only ever managed to get my habit down to about half a pack a day. I'm currently at ~8 cigarettes a day which is driving me nuts.

I work from home and my partner is overseas and I'm in an "easy" two weeks at work, so I have only me against myself right now.

I'm a trans woman, and smoking wreaks absolute havoc on my body's ability to absorb estrogen. With each cigarette I shoot myself in the foot. I've been through so much, why ruin this body and existence I have worked so hard for?

Anyway, thanks to this community for helping me start this process. I'm reading Carr's book and downing lots of tea and chewing pens and toothpicks.

I've "quit" before and made it two weeks. Lame. I'm going for permanent ban this time around.

That's my story. Huzzah!

Day 1, tired of many failed quits, but determined!

I am 55, been smoking since age 15, and having pretty severe shortness of breath. My mom died of COPD. My dad died of lung cancer. I HAVE to do this, yet I am afraid. I hate turning into a crazy bitch and also hate failing. I have tried quitting many times. THIS IS IT! Starting today, I will be free of cigarettes for the rest of my life! I am using a patch and could also use as much encouragement as I can get.

How persistent this is....

I have had my last smoke nearly 500 days ago (well, there was a relapse of 1 cigarette in between I found while sorting through a box - smoking that was the grossest thing ever, so I don't count that...)

I consider myself basically craving free, it is very barely that I think about smoking at all, mostly when I sit in an airplane and just think about how nice it is not to have the jitters and craving for being away from the coffin nails for that long. I'm even able to stand next to smokers without having the need to bum a smoke...

Something I never thought to be possible after 3-6 months, when I still had cravings semi regularly, which I needed willpower to resist. So for all out of you there, who are still wondering if it will get better: It did  for me, and for most of the others here and I talked to. So there is no reason why it wouldn't get better for you.

But then suddenly, this morning, I was sitting at a McDonald's, sipping a coffee, waiting for our car to be done at a garage, it hit me. A craving like I last had it about a year ago, and a strong urge to go and look for a smoke somewhere. It was just the same feeling as when having to have been in a meeting for too long, and you know that knot in the stomach would dissolve with the first inhale.

But I now also know that it will pass on it's own, and that I need to just get past this slight bump. And I will not give in!

Almost had to reset my badge.

I left my house with the express purpose of buying a pack. I walked down the street towards the liquor store. Instead of heading to the right which makes for a five minute round-trip, I headed off to the left.

I thought I owed myself more time. I spent my time thinking about the great progress I've made in the past week, how when I do my laundry this week I'll be done with smelling like cigarettes, how I really need to keep gum in my pocket as faithfully as I used to keep a lighter there. Fifteen minutes later when I walked past the liquor store, I had no need to go in and kept walking right back home.

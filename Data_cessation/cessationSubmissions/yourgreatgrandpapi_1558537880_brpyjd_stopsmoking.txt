Best way to get out tar?

Recently I started my journey to quitting smoking. After 2 days without a cigarette, I got angry at a coworker, cave in and bought a pack. 

During the first two days I wasnâ€™t getting any brown speckled mucus up, but after I had 2 cigarettes, the next couple of hours I was getting it to come up. 

Is there a better way to get it out without smoking? Any idea on how long it takes for your body to completely get all that crap out? 

P.S. I crumbled the pack up, and trying again :)

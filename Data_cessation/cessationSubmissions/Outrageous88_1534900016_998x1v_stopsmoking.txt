Let my F up be a lesson

Iâ€™m going to have to reset my badge. Last year on 8/1 I quit smoking. I was living with an indoor smoker at the time and it was the hardest thing I ever put myself through. 

I used the patch for 10 days and on the 11th day i took it off and went through the withdrawals. Carrâ€™s book really got through to me. 

I went out with some old friends, after a hard breakup and smoked. I didnâ€™t smoke again until a few days ago. I made it an entire fkn year and now iâ€™m back at square one. 

Iâ€™m trying not to beat myself up because I know I can do it, itâ€™s just a matter of doing it. I went all day today without smoking and I just bought a pack. ðŸ˜” 

I think my problem was not being as prepared because I thought itâ€™d be easier this time around bc I know I can quit and that I donâ€™t need to smoke. 

I guess I just needed a place to vent. 

Any advice is welcomed.

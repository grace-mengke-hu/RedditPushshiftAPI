Boredom

I've been smoking for 14 years, The longest I've managed to quit is 3 weeks. I've cut down to 1 a day stretched over 4-5 sessions. I work 10-12 hour days, I used to take a smoke break every 2 hours. I don't anymore. I used to smoke a pack while drinking with friends, don't do that anymore. I used to smoke 2 on my way to work and 1 on my home, cut that out ages ago. But I still NEED that one per day. When I work all day I have a bit in the morning and bit after work and I'm good. But on days off I find myself sneaking out for a drag every couple hours. I find I have the hardest time not smoking when I'm bored, or when I'm working on something I don't want to do but have to (during my free time). The cravings when I'm bored are worse than when I'm stressed! 

TL:DR - Any advice for handling boredom cravings?

My Gift to Myself

I'll be 30 years old in August. I guess you could say I'm having a mid-life crisis. And it very well *could* be my mid-life. If I don't quit, I could easily die before age 60. 

I've smoked at least a pack a day for 10 years. Today is day 4 without a cigarette. I've tried to quit dozens of times, and I'm struggling with my resolve again. 

But if I stay quit, my birthday will be my 3 month mark. That was intentional. I can't think of a better gift to give myself. I don't want to be an addict anymore. 

I've got a piece of nicotine gum tucked in my lip as I type this. I've been browsing this sub all day, but any insight would be greatly appreciated. I know it *can* be done but the brain-fog makes it difficult to look to the future. I can't let nicotine lie  to me or run my life any more. This has to be the last time!!

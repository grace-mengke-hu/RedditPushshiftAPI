Been a week.

It's been a week so far. I run everyday. I just want normal dopamine levels. I don't want nicotine withdrawal after each and every dip like I'm tied in a vicious cycle. I broke free.  Can't believe I've made it so far. Can't believe I sat watching TV last night for 3 hours straight. I hope someone can relate to this. Stay strong. Read and watch Allan Car.

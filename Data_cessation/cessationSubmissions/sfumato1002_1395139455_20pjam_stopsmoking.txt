40 days! On my way to a better me!

Only when I am really stressed do I feel like smoking...but I have associated smoking to giving up on my dreams and hopes...I am also in NoFap and my life is improving. I work out, I eat healthy...Smoking is just not part of the new me anymore. Anyway, stay strong and take care!

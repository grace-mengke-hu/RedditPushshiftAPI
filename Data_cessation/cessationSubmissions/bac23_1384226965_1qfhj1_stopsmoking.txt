Need a little help

So i have been a social smoker for a few years and never smoked during the week. Lately, I'll smoke one cigarette every other day a night when im bored, but now if I don't have one at night, I'll get this craving. I think it's time for me to quit and am looking for some advice. I'm willing to go cold turkey and really want to kick this habit. Any advice?

His quitting may destroy our relationship. How do I cope?

Hello reddit, I live with my boyfriend of less than a year who is in the process of quitting smoking. He's gone through a lot of stress over the past few months. I was injured at work and we didn't have a strong second income. We are evading eviction, and he is quitting smoking due to a recent potential cancer diagnosis (his biopsy is monday). His mood has been awful since quitting a few days ago, and he won't talk about it. His anger is primarily directed at me, from what I can tell. He seems to be fine with friends, but is constantly angry and raging at everything I do. I saw today that he's looking at other apartments. I've been patient and supportive, and he's told me that he is "dealing with a lot of self issues", but I really need some reassurance. I'm in fear that he's going to leave or keep driving me away. I can't tell if it's actually him acting this way, or the withdrawal. I don't want to keep asking him if it is just the withdrawl, but if there's something else going on, I want to address it. How do I remain supportive without losing my mind?

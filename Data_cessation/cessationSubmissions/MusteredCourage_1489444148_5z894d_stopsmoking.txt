Vivid and strange dreams after quitting?

I'm about 25 days in after smoking several cigarettes a day for the past 4 years (yay me!) but lately I've been finding myself having very strange and disturbing dreams every night. The dreams aren't related to smoking or anything but they are vivid and just really weird, I often wake up with anxiety and generally feeling unsettled. Is this a common symptom of quitting tobacco? Has anyone else dealt with this?

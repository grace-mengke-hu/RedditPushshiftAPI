Elevated blood pressure/pulse after quitting?

Hey all! I was wondering whether any of you experienced elevated blood pressure after quitting? Saturday (day 13 for me), I had a flare of arrhythmia (symptom of a mild heart condition I've had since I was little), which I haven't had since high school.  It was pretty bad.  I couldn't catch my breath, and had some fairly severe discomfort in my chest.  My blood pressure was pretty high and my heart beat was very elevated (100 bpm resting).

My mom is a physician, and gave me some beta blockers, which resolved the problem, but I've been a little short of breath for the past few days (my mom doesn't know I was a smoker, that's how embarrassed I was by the habit).  My SO thinks it may be a result of the eCigarette, because he gets out of breath when he uses it.  

If it continues I'll go to a physician, though I hate to do it if it just means I need to quit using my ecig.  Just wondering whether anyone has had any similar experiences! 

*Note: That day I also switched to 0 nicotene in my eCig, and am now on Day 3 of no nicotene, so not sure if that's related at all!

Quit date of next Friday, June 26.

I am doing, I have had this date in my head since Christmas. It is now finally here, and I am scared. I have a vape, with a high nicotine level. I am hoping that it helps! Any advice would be appreciated! I have smoked for almost 20 years. I think this year will be my 19 year.

Well I made it to 500

It was actually really hard this weekend to make it, but luckily I set it as my goal and it came after my brothers bachelor party. There were cigarettes lying down on the table and I was trying to think of an excuse to smoke one and I decided to check my time to see if I had hit 500, but it was day 499. Anyway I'm glad I made it through the weekend with a couple of packs sitting out in front of me the entire time. Stay strong everyone and set little goals and try your best :)

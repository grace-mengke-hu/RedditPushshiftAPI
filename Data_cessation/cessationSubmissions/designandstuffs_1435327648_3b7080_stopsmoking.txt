so far

I'm not that far in. I'm basically starting my 3rd day. It honestly does seem to be getting a little easier (maybe...). There are times when it's like, "oh, this isn't bad at all" and then other times when I want to murder someone. 

I did read Allen Carrs book and here's the thing: (and this is probably different for everyone). No matter what I still have cravings. Changing my attitude or outlook doesn't change the fact that I've just suddenly broken a physical/chemical addiction. What it does do is make it a little easier to say NO. Yes, it is harder for me to focus. that is not a lie. It is my mind and body readjusting. and that's okay. It's hard for me to concentrate at work. I tried reading last night and after a page I had to put it down because I had no clue what I just read. 

Anyway, I'm getting more excited and with each time I say "no" the easier it is to say no the next time. The fact of the matter is that this is REALLY hard. REALLLLLY hard. My chest/lungs are starting to hurt (par for the course, I believe?). I'm not sleeping well, but then again I never did.  I've got other emotional things going on at the moment, I have anxiety issues but I am doing this. I am escaping the monster and I will not look back.

Day 4 has been the hardest so far. Any advice on how to deal with the anxiety?

Days 1-3 were fairly easy, which made me overly cocky and totally unprepared for the hell that today brought. I can deal with the cravings, but my anxiety is worse than it has ever been and I'm having the hardest time focusing on anything. 

How do you deal with the anxiety? Any suggestions? I'm going on a 21 hour flight on Tuesday and I'm starting to worry for myself and my husband if this gets any worse. Thank you in advance.

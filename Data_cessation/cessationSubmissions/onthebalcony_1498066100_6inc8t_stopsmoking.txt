Gearing up to quit - prep advice?

I'm 31. I started at 17, had a three year break in my early 20s and a million two week breaks after that. I used to be a pulmonary nurse, and a smoking cessation instructor. 

I'm quitting because I want to be pregnant. I've never managed to quit for me, the three year break was when I first met my non-smoking husband. Patches, gums, sprays, they don't do it for me. It's all about the breaks and the fiddling. 

Any advice? Quitting in August, together with going off alcohol, after our vacation.

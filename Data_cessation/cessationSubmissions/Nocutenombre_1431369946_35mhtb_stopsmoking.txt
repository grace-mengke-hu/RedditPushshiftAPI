How do I make it to the Star?

I'm in week three of my quit. I've read on here that 3 weekers have a tendency to relapse, and I don't want to do that. When I've been down or craving I've come here and that has helped.  But this weekend sucked.  I'm super cranky and I'm not as happy as I should be about having quit.  I guess I thought there'd be more bells and whistles......I want to stay quit but I don't want to be a miserable non-smoker.

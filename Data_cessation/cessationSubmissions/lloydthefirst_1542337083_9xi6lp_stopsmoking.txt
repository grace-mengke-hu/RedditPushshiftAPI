When you all stopped smoking, did you get sick for a while?

I've almost completely stopped smoking a few months ago, but developed a cough right after and it's beginning to worry me. 

I also live in a very dry environment and have health anxiety, so it could all be in my head, but I'm still looking for some advice.

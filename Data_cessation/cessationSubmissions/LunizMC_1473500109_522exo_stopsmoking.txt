My first smoking dream.

Well, nightmare actually, if you consider it.  In the dream I was aware that I was throwing away two weeks of hell, but it didn't stop me.  Don't even remember the actual physical act either. I just remember waking up and feeling like I'd thrown all my hard work away. I still can't shake the feeling now, even though I know I haven't smoked for two weeks.  Very strange.

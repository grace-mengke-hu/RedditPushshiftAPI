Introduction ETC

Hi Everyone!

I've been lurking for a while. On Tuesday I caught the cold and was too sick to smoke. So, I figure, since I already have two days in I might as well roll with it. Today was my first day going about my regular routine and I did not have a single cigarette! I have a story for you.

I work as a dog groomer. This morning, my first client was a cocker spaniel I have been grooming for nearly three years. As I stated above, I have not smoked since tuesday. The smell of this dog nearly killed me. I thought I was going to be sick.. she REEKED. How could I have her as a client so long and not notice?! Do I always smell like that? I'm telling you guys, there has never been anything more motivating. As much as I habitually want a cigarette, the thought of one actually makes me nauseaus. Even after I bathed this dog, I could smell the stale cigarettes off of her. Sin.

Thanks for having me!

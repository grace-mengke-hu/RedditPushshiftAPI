Day 7...and I went out drinking last night!

PaD+ for 13 years. Decided to quit last Monday (I'm a recovered boozer, started working out and dieting, I figured, why not?) With the only cessation aid being a vape mod I bought for $100, which pays for itself in 3 weeks. Went out for a few last night and forgot my vape, literally everyone around me was smoking. I never realized how many people smoke that many ciggs until this past week, and I'm a bartender.

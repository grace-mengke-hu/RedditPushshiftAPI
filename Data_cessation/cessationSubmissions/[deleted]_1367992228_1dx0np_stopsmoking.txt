Signed up to a gym..best decision ever!

I am 20 years old not as old as most smokers posting here. I have been smoking since I was 14 just to look cool(stupid phase) then i got addicted.  Things that made me quit:

1. low immune system getting even worse and getting sick all the time!

2. A girl in my class told me I smell like cigarettes and that it's a turn of.

3. I felt like shit coughing every night and morning.

It's been a few months I have quit now haven't been counting exactly.  The "premium e-cig" which in my opinion is the best on the market help me quit too besides the exercise.  If you're a smoker and reading this QUIT NOW!

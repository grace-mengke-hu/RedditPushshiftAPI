Day 4 almost done.

Aside from some irritability, my cravings are starting to become less severe. Sleep seems to be getting deeper too. Did anyone else experience that after a few days? I've only been smoking for 8 years, about half a pack a day (first couple years I chain smoked Marlboro Reds, but the last several years it's been half a pack or less of Marlboro lights - not sure if that's contributing).

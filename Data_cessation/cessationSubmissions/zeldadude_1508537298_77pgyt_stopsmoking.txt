When should I be concerned that my chest isn't clearing up?

I last smoked a cigarette 28 days ago. Ive had really bad phlegm build up that I can't seem to get up and I thought it would have cleared up by now. I have gotten a good amount up but it still feels like there's a lot of phlegm that's just impossible get out. Coughing, mucinex, nothing. It's sooo close I can feel it but I just can't get it up.

Should I see a doctor or give it some more time? Excited for my 1 month date though!

Edit: oh and I smoke weed and haven't quit that. I never thought that weed could fuck up my lungs that much, but could it possibly be that? Having to clear my throat before talking is really annoying considering I DON'T EVEN SMOKE ANYMORE!

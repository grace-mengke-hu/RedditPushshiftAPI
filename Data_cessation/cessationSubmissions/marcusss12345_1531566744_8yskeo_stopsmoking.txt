Yesterday, I went to a party without smoking

So, I started out as a social party-smoker back when I was 14. I'm 19 now, and since then there haven't been a smokefree party, ever. Smoking has also become a daily ocurrence. Alcohol is one of my hugest triggers, and getting drunk increases my cravings exponentially.

However, last night, for the first time in my life, I went to the club with my friends, most of them being smokers. I got drunk, had fun, but didn't smoke at all.

I guess I just wanted to share this, because every attempt to stop smoking has stopped as soon as I got drunk and offered a cigarette.

But this time, I can tell it's going to be different. This time, I am stopping for real. And nothing can stop me. I'm on day 7 now, by the way.

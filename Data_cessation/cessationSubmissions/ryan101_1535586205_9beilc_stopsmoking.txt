9 years today

It's been 9 years since I stopped.  Proof:  [here's my really old reddit post that I made a couple of days after I quit. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9g222/askreddit_its_been_58_hours_since_i_quit/)  I haven't so much as taken a puff of a cigarette  since and I don't vape.

It was a struggle for a while but the craving does go away entirely after time. My brain no longer associates the smell of cigarettes with pleasure. As a matter of fact the only reason it ever comes into my mind is the little calendar reminder that pops up to say congrats for another year. I just want to share the experience for anyone who wants to understand if the craving for cigarettes really does go away. It does, but it does take time.

Finally earned my smiley face!

Obviously today marks one year, and I could not be happier about my decision. I say decision because that's exactly what it took for me to quit. For anyone reading this that is contemplating quitting or having a rough time of it, I do not have the answer for you, but I am happy to share my version of success.

**FULL DISCLOSURE: I did not start smoking until the age of 24 and quit at 29. So I started smoking as an adult and only smoked for about 4.5 years.**

It took me about a year and a half to finally pull the trigger. I knew I needed to, but it was a beautiful excuse to relieve stress. I mean, not really, but that's what I believed. I had become used to smoking to the point where anything anyone might say to me that was akin to the health problems I was causing myself fell on deaf ears. It was easier to continue smoking than attempt walking down what I had heard was a very difficult road. 

I met a girl. She didn't necessarily love my smoking, but also didn't try to change me. She didn't try to make me feel bad about it, and I honestly didn't. We decided to move away together, with the understanding that I would not smoke in the car or in the house. Here's where being lazy comes in handy: I decided it would be less of a pain in the ass to quit smoking than to follow the rules that would allow me to continue. 

That's pretty much it. I know it isn't exactly an impressive story, but in the end wanting to quit wasn't enough; I needed to attach a meaning to it. It was like a rider on a new bill in my life. 

Thank you for reading my story. Again, I don't know if my story is interesting or helpful to any of you, but it's what worked for me. I suppose one could apply the old adage "If it looks stupid, but it works, it ain't stupid." Good luck to all you future quitters, and congratulations to all you current ones.

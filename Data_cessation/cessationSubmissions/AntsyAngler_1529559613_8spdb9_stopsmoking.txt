I just heard I got offered a great job! So glad I didn't smoke.

I know I would never get offered this job if I went to the interview smelling like smokes.  I know I would not enjoy working there if I tried to be a closet smoker, like I've done at jobs for the last 6 years, ever since my professional image mattered.  

I'd shower in the morning, not smoke after the shower, work all day wishing for a smoke, often invent a reason to leave work early so I could smoke.  Chain smoke and often drink in the evening and do it all over the next day.  It sucked.  I was spending 1/2 my life nic-ing out.  I am sure my attention at work was not as good as it could have been. 

But now I'M FREE!  I'm a Non-Smoker!  Hell Yes.  Never, ever going back to it. Not one puff.

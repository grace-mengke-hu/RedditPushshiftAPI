1 week

I've smoked close to 10 years. Never really thought much of it until my 4yo asked me why I smoked. I didn't have an answer for the kid. Today marks my first week cigarette free. I do have to admit that I've been using the Alto, but I have not had an actual cigarette for 7 straight days. I can breathe again. &lt;3

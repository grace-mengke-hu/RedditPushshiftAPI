Read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking, stopped for 4 years, then...

I forgot that important chapter about "don't just have 1".  I have to stop again.  Getting hooked was a slow process, just one on a night out with girlfriends, it was gross, and I'd sworn I would never smoke again, but everyone was in the smoke pit so I joined and smoked. Fuck.  Over the next 8 months I had 1 here and 1 there, until I found myself almost seeking out the smokers, and then bought some.  It's like I convinced myself that I could walk away whenever I wanted, instead of reminding myself that smoking sucks, that it makes me stink, that it's expensive.  

THAT IT SUCKS!!! 

I'm rereading the book and just wanted to say: don't ever "just have one" once you've successfully stopped.

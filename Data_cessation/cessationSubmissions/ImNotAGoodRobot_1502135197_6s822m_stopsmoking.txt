3 months

I still feel the urge. I recently broke up from my so and I always ask myself if I need a smoke, as if the cigarette will heal my love wounds. I hope I will not get fooled by the addiction, which is always there, like a shark ready to become again in charge, after I lose control. Keep up strong, addicts, the addiction is just one puff away from us. On a happier note, hurray 3 months. Long gone are the days when all I did was to crawl in bed and in life, because of the lack of nicotine. Now I run and I lift at squats even 100 kg. Also I am freeeeeeeeeeeeee from cigarettes and I can't express this feeling. Hope you are too!

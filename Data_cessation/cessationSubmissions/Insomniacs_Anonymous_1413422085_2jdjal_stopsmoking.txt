Just got back from a heavy drinking session.

I have been quitting smoking nicotine for just over two weeks now.
To cut a long story short; I have come back from a night drinking. My friend who tried to quit smoking multiple times because he still smoked weed mixed with tobacco when he quit. He, whilst stopping smoking again found a herbal mix to replace tobacco. He gave me some of this stuff a week ago, I came back from drinking tonight where I was sat by two girls smoking, smelling their smoke. Curious to see the difference I have just smoked a "cigarette" of this none tobacco/nicotine mix. I can report whilst it has the same smoke and throat hit, it acceptably differers in taste significantly from tobacco and doesn't give and nicotine pleasure hit at all. This has let me realise that it is not the smoking that makes us addicted but what we smoke, I hope to continue to quit the evil tobacco yet still being able to enjoy a certain herbal pastime evert few months. This made me realise It's the tobacco not the smoking habit I'm addicted to.

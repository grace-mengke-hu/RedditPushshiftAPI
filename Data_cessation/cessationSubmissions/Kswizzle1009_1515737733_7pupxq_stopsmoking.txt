I want a cigarette?

So I’m almost at month 3 and I’m starting to get cravings again like a few a day which is so odd to me because I’m not stressed out and I’m not around smokers and I’m doing nothing to really trigger me wanting one but for the past few days I’ve been wanting one pretty bad. 

I’ve even been having dreams about smoking. Lol. The cravings aren’t that strong so I’m not worried too much about it and I definitely have the strength and willpower to not smoke, but it kinda sucks. I thought these cravings would be over by now. 

Any long term quitters out there ever get this? Will I always get these cravings!?

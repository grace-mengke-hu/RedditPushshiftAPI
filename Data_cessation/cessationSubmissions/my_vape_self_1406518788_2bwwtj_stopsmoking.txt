some nights you just despair the truth. (why quit)

One of our friends asked why do you quit.  I typed this quickly.  It is probably the best that I have. Repost:

Because I realized in my forties what every smoker should know:  

*You don't have to spend a single second of your day thinking about when you can smoke.*

After you **finally** get that, we can talk about that spoon from the matrix, the tree falling in the woods, and the sounds of the spheres.

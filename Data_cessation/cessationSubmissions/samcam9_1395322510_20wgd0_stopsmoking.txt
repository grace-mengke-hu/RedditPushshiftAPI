3 days gone and it's seems too easy...

I've been a smoker for 6 years and on 20 a day for the last 2-3 years. I have tried quitting before but always failed pretty early. 
I'm trying again and it just seems to be going too well....I don't wanna rub it in on anyone struggling but it just makes me worry that it's all gonna hit me at once. 
Has anyone else experienced something similar?

No, no, and definitely no.

Went out to a pub with friends, all smokers, everyone ordered beer and fries. I didn't have a bite, I'm dieting, didn't drink, I was driving (plus.. dieting), and definitely didn't smoke. And I couldn't care less, only now that I'm home I realize that I actually really enjoyed myself forgetting about all that shit. Guys, I'm so zen right now I think I'm part Buddha.

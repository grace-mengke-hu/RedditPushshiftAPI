1 month, 812 cigarettes not smoked. Down to 1.5 mg/mL e-juice. I feel so much better.

I smoked a pack a day for 13 years. My wife insisted I try vaping so July 3rd when I ran out of cigarettes we drove to the vape store. I was a sourpuss. "This stupid", "thus won't work", "I NEED cigarettes", I LIKE smoking" etc. I reluctantly got a beginner setup and some 18 mg/mL juice. Fast forward a month and I've got 3 fancy mods, I'm making my own juice (1.5 mg or 0mg nicotene), building my own coils and chasing giant clouds lol. I tried my dad's cigarette the other day and it was horrendous! If anybody keeps trying and failing, try vaping. It really does work. I can breathe!  I can taste food! I stopped snoring! I don't think I'm addicted to nicotene anymore but I AM addicted to cloudchasing! If you have questions about vaping feel free. All you cold-turkey guys, keep up the good work.

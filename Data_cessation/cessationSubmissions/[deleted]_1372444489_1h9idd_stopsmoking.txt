Does anyone else feel like e-cigs make them sick?

I quit smoking awhile back for about a month and my blu e-cig helped get me through it. After a weekend of drinking I was back to my old ways. I'm planning on quitting on July 1st. I am hesitant to keep using my e-cig because I feel like it made me sick. I know that I get a lil sick just from not smoking but I'm really just wondering if anyone else experienced this same thing.

Is it true that smoking cause wrinkles?

I am 39/M...I have smoked since I was 18. I am starting to see wrinkles around my eyes when I smile..thin wrinkles....Also white patches in the skin..I quit smoking today...this is my 1st day non-smoker...Wish me luck.

EDIT; never mine my badge...I try to quit 2 months ago...and did it for about 2 weeks...but relapsed...here I go again.

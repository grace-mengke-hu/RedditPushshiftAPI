Wanna get off the ciggies

Hello everybody,

I'll keep this short and sweet. I've been smoking for the past 12-13 years (26 now). I started smoking at a very young age due to peer pressure. Peer pressure is a son of a bitch. I'd like to know from any of the quitters out there what helped some of you guys quit. 

I also smoked cannabis with it for all those years also but quit around 3 weeks ago so I know quitting smoking altogether is gonna be really tough for me. I don't even really enjoy smoking anymore because it feels like I'm just going through the motions now. No pleasure from it all except if I'm out drinking on a night out. Look forward to hearing your advice.

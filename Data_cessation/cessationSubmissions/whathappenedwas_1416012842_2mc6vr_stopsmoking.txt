Weekends are the hardest.

So I want to preface this by saying that I'm not talking about smoking cigs, since I somehow managed to stop doing that (and now of course it's like I can't even remember), but about vaping weed. I know there's /r/leaves for that, but you guys were so helpful to me when I was quitting smoking, I just wanted to reach out and say I could really use some support... there are just more people here, and I don't feel ready to get to know a whole new community right now.

The truth is, I stuck with weed because it was kind of a way to keep smoking without smoking cigs. It's not the feeling of weed I enjoy--it's the smoking part. The inhalation part. It feels so good to do that.

Today is day 4.

Friday night is when I'd usually sit down, watch some Colbert/Daily Show/Key and Peele that I missed during the week, and smoke. 

The same thing went for cigs, honestly, and I managed to do that... but it's so hard. In some ways, quitting cigs was easier because I still had the weed to look forward to. Now that seems totally nonsensical, like cheating... but here I am. Day 4.

Remind me why I shouldn't do this again?

Resetting my badge for a happy reason

I'm laying down the vape!

It stopped being fun. I thought I'd be vaping for a while still but recently it's been getting on my nerves. Finding the time and a place to smoke, spending money, stinking (even if it's not as bad as regular cigs), the constant withdrawal/satisfaction dance. The first few drags in the morning were glorious but the entire rest of the day it was just withdrawal avoidance. No fun. It's also pretty unhealthy.

Vaping has been a phenomenal crutch though. I've been on zero nicotine for about two months now and I've gotten used to it quite well. My mood swings are much less than when I had nicotine, and I can now go hours without vaping. I used to have trouble with long appointments but not anymore.

I used a long flight about two months ago as a kickstart to stop nicotine. I had to go 18 hours without nicotine anyway because there is no smoking on the plane and during the layover, and I decided just to not refill the vape with nicotine-containing liquid upon landing.

By the way: I have a quit day buddy. He's quitting regular cigarettes without using a vape but I think it will do us both good to do this together.

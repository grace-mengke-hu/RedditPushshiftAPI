Tips for those who like the smell of cigarette smoke?

People always talk about how bad the smell is after they quit. This isn't my first attempt, I've read Easyway, etc...

I grew up with a brother that smoked. He has since stopped, but I have so, so many positive memories of the smell of cigarette smoke. It's not just the memories at this point, I actually enjoy that smell. I have since I was a non-smoker. 

This always leads me to problems. When I break my attempts to quit and have a cigarette, it's never a feeling of disgust. It smells and taste good to me. 

Does anyone have any tips regarding this? I want to quit, but like this is pretty futile.

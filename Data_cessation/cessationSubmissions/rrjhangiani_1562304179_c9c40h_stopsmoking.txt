Just started stopping and have a question

So I just started my journey. So far my app says I’m smoke free for 1 day, 22 hours. 
I love this app, because every time i want to smoke, I look at it and think, “if I smoke now I’ve wasted 1 day, 22 hours”. 
My question is this. If you guys fall off the horse, for example, have one cig while on a night out or succumb to an urge but instantly regret it: do you restart your timer from zero?.

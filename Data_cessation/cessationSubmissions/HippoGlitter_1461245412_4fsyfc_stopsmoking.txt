Day 16 and Pregnant!

16 days ago I found out I was pregnant, and 16 days ago my husband and I both quit cold turkey. 


It's been hard at points between hormones and craving fits, but I know I can do it. With the little worm growing inside me, I have no choice. I hope my future child will appreciate growing up healthy in a smoke-free home.

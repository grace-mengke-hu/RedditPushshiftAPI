Over the hump

In every other attempt, day two was my breaking point.

I was smoking a pack a day for 11 years, broke up with smoking last summer and it sucked, hopped back on when my SO broke up with me.

Now. Now it seems to easy. I finally really want it. I've had one major craving and that was Tuesday, a little over 24 hrs in. 

I can breathe again. I don't wake up stuffed up. I've only had one piece of nicorette, that's it, and it's all because I want to do it this time. Not for her, not for them, but for me. I want it. 

Now I just need to the bot to get me my badge!

2 weeks in!

I've been doing fantastic. I'm still vaping but not as much and ill be going to 0 nicotine next time I buy. I've gotten to the point where I forgot about my e-cig I didn't think about it or cigarettes! It was a great feeling. I've been having dreams about smoking and woke up with an incredible feeling of guilt like I had gotten so far and failed. But at this point I can't see myself smoking again it's not worth it.

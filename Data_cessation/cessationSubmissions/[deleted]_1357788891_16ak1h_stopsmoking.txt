Smoked my last cigarette, and I know I can quit!

This past year has been amazing for me, I have been with my SO for 4 years, we purchased a house together and got a kitty named [Banner](http://imgur.com/7HzJL,6alUM,CjHTr) . I quit smoking for one month a few months ago, and when I got into the process of buying a new house I began smoking again. 


Today I had a meeting at the bank and realized how much money I can use to pay off my credit cards, or start paying on a new car I decided I had to quit, for good this time. My significant other and I are doing this together. I have been smoking for 4 years and he has been for 10. I have a whiteboard on the fridge and I wrote down my motivation, for example : Paying off bills, getting a new car, having the wedding I always wanted, having kids, vacations and peace of mind.

With the two of us quitting we will save approximately $505 a month ($6060 a year!). We realized we are just throwing this money away to smoke a stick. It is going to be a rough road for the both of us, but I hope we can do it.

What do you fellow redditors use as encouragement, or use to help with the cravings and urges to smoke?

Here is to a new better future. 

Cheers and thanks!

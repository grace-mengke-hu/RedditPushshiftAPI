I am going to miss smoking :-(

I’m on day 2, and I’ve had this feeling for a while.

I’m going to miss it. Miss having a cigarette while I drive, while I drink coffee, while sitting outside on a nice summers evening. 

It’s a strange feeling to anticipate missing something like this. Heck, I already am missing puffing away as I browse random shit on Reddit.

But I suppose that’s what this fucking addiction is doing to me. I’m stronger than this shit, but fuck... how nice would it be if we could just smoke till our hearts were content with no health risks ?

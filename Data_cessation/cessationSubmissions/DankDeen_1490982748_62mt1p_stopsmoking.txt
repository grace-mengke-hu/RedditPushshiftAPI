50 Days!!!(a day over 7 weeks)

Woohoo! 50 days strong! Just got back from a much needed dentist appointment. Don't let Nicotine control your life. For far too long it was holding me back, and I'm happy to say that I feel like I'm finally free! Couldn't have done it without you guys! Thanks for all of your stories and all of your support. Much love.

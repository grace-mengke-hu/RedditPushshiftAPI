Not much support going on IRL :-(

So....I wish I could brag a little bit and have people be proud of me in my life. But honestly it seems like no one even notices I quit! I used to go outside at least 3 times a day at work during a 6 hr shift. It's important to me, and having that extra support would really help. A coworker I quit with already has caved in. She admitted to me yesterday that this weekend she smoked, and now she's bought a pack! I don't want that to be me. My one non-smoking coworker didn't even noticed I quit. And when I told her how many days it had been she didn't even say congratulations. I announce it from time to time and no one seems happy for me. Maye they don't believe I'll last?! I wish people believed in me! It'd be nice! I told my doctor during a check up yesterday and the nurse that checked my stats that I quit and they didn't really say much just "good job" which that was nice... I can't tell my boyfriend I quit who would be the one that might be very happy for me, because he thought I quit a long time ago! I know I'm terrible, but he just doesn't understand what it's like for a smoker. It's hard. I've tried quitting a lot. But I've never made it this far!!! I'm very proud of myself and wish I could celebrate with others in my life.I wish they'd be REALLY happy for me and not just pass it off like it's not a big deal. I never want to pick up a cigarette again its a big deal to me! I just feel like the people I surround myself around are selfish and are all stuck in their own little world... Quitting is one of the most important things you could do for yourself and it takes strength! Thanks for this reading this and for this subreddit for letting me vent!!!! Good luck on everyone's journey.

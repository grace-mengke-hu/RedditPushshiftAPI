I've made the decision today 9/25/18 to finally quit smoking ...

I'm in my mid 30's and have been smoking since I was 18. I watched my grandfather die of lung cancer when I was around 10  . My father at the time was a heavy smoker but the anger he felt over my grandpas death (he was only in his 50's) was enough to make him quit .my dad has now outlived my grandfather by a decade and is still going strong .im sure he would not be here if had not quit. He also quit to set an example for me ....so needless to say I feel ashamed and guilty for becoming a smoker. I even did my best to hide it from my family for many years for these reasons . anyhow I've made the decision TODAY to quit. I'm now the same age my father was when he quit ,and I always told myself I would quit at that point. anyhow I don't have many people to talk to this about ,and they say it helps to tell others you are quitting . So hey guys ,I'm quitting !  Wish me luck and will listen to any advice . Thanks

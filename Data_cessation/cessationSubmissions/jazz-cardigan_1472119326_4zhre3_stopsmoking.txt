First day without nicotine.

Yesterday i made a decision to stop cold turkey with snus (im swedish so it's a special type of tobacco popular here). Feeling kinda nauseous and down, but i will keep doing this!
What i need right now is some motivation, can you guys please write some benifits with quitting? so i can read it whenever my abstinence gets to heavy, haha.

Currently smoking my last just worried about attitude for the next week.

I quit once for about 2 years and got back into it a year ago after dealing with some stressful life changes. I'm ready to quit I hate smoking, I hate smelling like smoke, I hate having paranoia about illnesses, I hate having a sore stuffy throat after smoking, I hate having my breathing impacted.

I'm just worried about lashing out, my stress levels building up and taking it out on my loved ones. Hopefully I can keep it together this week I always have my vape in case of emergency but its uncharged. I just do not want to smoke anymore. I know if I can make it past this week Ill be golden.

Made a bet with a friend. I smoked. I don't want to tell him because he will smoke if he knows. I'm still going to honor the bet though!

Ten days in and I failed. Shitty day. The bet is whoever smokes first has to buy the other person a certain thing. Nothing too crazy. A little under $200 item. I'M GOING TO GET HIM IT. I just know that if I tell him he'll buy a pack. We're both ten days in. How long till I buy and give it to him? Or should I just do it now?

On Day 14(?), feeling psychologically depressed, low attention span, weird memory loss, dull, dozed off mid meeting, etc. What’s happening?

Talking to my colleagues and boss, I keep forgetting names of people I literally work everyday with and what I’m about to say. Slept off in a meeting of 20 people yesterday (gave up coffee along with cigs 14 days ago as well), feeling mentally drained and lost all the time. Oscillating between depression and anxiety.

It’s getting a bit scary now and I fear it has begun to impact my work and my colleagues and boss are noticing. I know it’s so easy to start smoking again and get back into the pattern of working hard and then rewarding myself with a cigarette and coffee, and then be high strung and ready to work again. But I really don’t want to do that. I know I’m going to keep at it and get through this. But my mind is negatively impacting every aspect of my life and, more than frustrating, I think it’s leading to creating a bad image at work. What do I do?

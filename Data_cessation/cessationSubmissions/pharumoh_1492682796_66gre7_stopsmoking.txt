It all starts now

Hi guys, long time lurker and as of today, non smoker here. I tried quitting once before when I went cold turkey but it was hard. I discovered it is much easier to quit incrementally. I was smoking up to a pack a day a few months ago. Brought it down to 2-3 a day and as of this week it's been 1 in 3 days. Officially had my last cigarette today and vowed to never buy another pack or smoke again. One of my friends at work has decided to quit with me and we're both supporting each other as we go along. So far, seeing the posts and comments from everyone here has helped me kick this habit and I've mmmm starting to feel like I've quit for good. No cravings yet. Will keep you guys updated if anything changes. Much love all!

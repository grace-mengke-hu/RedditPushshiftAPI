Stanford Smoking Cessation Research- Volunteers Needed (Compensation)!

We are a group of Stanford graduate students conducting research on new ways to help people quit smoking.
If you are a current smoker who has tried to quit smoking at least once in the past, or an ex-smoker who has recently quit smoking (quit within the past year) we would love to speak with you.
If you are interested in volunteering, please contact us at stanfordquithelp@gmail.com

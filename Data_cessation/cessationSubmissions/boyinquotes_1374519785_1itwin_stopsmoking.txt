Flirting with quitting

I'm flirting with quitting and I need stories to move this process along. 

I think about quitting more and more, my dad is a respiratory medical worker, and I have a cough that is getting worse. Been smoking since senior year of high school and I just graduated from college (nearly 5 years), I am feeling like I need to quit soon but I don't know if I've bottomed out yet to the point where I can make a real effort. I have a new job now and I wanted to capitalize on that to make the change, but my commute and the frequency of breaks allows me to smoke as much as ever. 

This morning I told myself I wasn't gonna buy another pack after I smoked the last one from the previous pack, but I broke down 3 hrs later. Maybe flirting with quitting online is the next step I need to make these kinds of empty threats into something with more potential.

Edit: So how did finally reach the point of quitting / general advice for my situation would be great

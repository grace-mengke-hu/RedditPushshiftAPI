Personal Best then relapse

Yesterday was 4 months almost no nicotine.

Two days before that I took three drags off of a cigarette.

Yesterday I bought a pack. 4 smokes then, 6 smokes today.

Its gross, but worse yet I feel sluggish and nauseous just like I did at a pack a day. I was preoccupied all day at work knowing I had that pack hidden at home. 

I haven't let my kids see me smoke, and I'm super self conscious about the smell. 

I feel like I'm in limbo. I dont want to smoke again, but I also dont want to redo the early days. 

If you're nicotine free, please do yourself a favor and stay that way a while longer.

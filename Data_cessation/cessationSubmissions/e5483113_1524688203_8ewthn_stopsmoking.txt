68.7 cigarettes not smoked

The number of days I’ve not smoked doesn’t make as huge an impact as knowing how many cigarettes I’ve not smoked. I’m 17 days in and it’s shocking to know that it’s equivalent to 68.7 cancer sticks. I still get thoughts of smoking just one stick, but I’ve come so far I don’t want to go back to square one. Coughing is completely gone, although I have to clear my throat from time to time but that’s about it. Post nasal drip is improving. Breathing is so much easier. I’ve signed up for a gym membership and will start Monday next week. Gonna start to eat clean next week too. Low carb keto diet. It feels good to be clean. I’ve never felt so empowered.

Almost smoked yesterday

Yesterday, out of the blue came this idea : "just one cig, c'mon".

That's the thing, when I'm ok and calm, or even agitated, while I have this high and mighty attitude that I don't smoke, I am above all that, then all is good even if cravings kick in. 

But that moment, when you start to doubt, or that moment when you tell yourself hmmm.. m.a.y.b.e.... that is when the real war begins. 

Part of you now wants to have a smoke. Will you identify with this part? will you take time and think through it a little? Will you just destroy it, don't think about it and go on with your day?

Anyhow yesterday I got this thought. Maybe I'll smoke just a little. Yeah stupid, but it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I searched the house for some cigs and thankfully none were around. I played some somafm drone zone to calm my nerves. Drank a lot of water. Popped some sleeping pills and went to bed. Might not sound like much, but it was really a tough evening. 

But today, in the morning I felt SO proud that I didn't cave! 
And when I looked at the app - 500 not smoked. I am really really glad I did not smoke yesterday, cause I know I'll be in the same cycle again today.

Stay strong brothers and sisters. One day at a time.

I'm going to change up my plan for today...

I was going to bake, but the weather is just too nice. And this is England, so that could change any second. So, I'm going to take myself to lunch amongst the people of Hertfordshire and enjoy the sunshine. Wish me luck...not really, actually I feel pretty good. Observations upon my return! Enjoy a smoke free day! :)) xx

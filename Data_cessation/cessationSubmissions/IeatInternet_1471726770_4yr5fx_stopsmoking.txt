The idea that you're quitting smoking makes the process 100 times more difficult to begin with. Living inside every smoker is a little nicotine monster that screams for its fix every waking moment, and it is only subdued once a cigarettes is lit. When you stop smoking you aren't quitting something you enjoy, you're escaping the nicotine monsters grip. Many people feel that they're quitting something they enjoy. They worry that life won't be as fun or happy without carrying their smokes around. Think back to when you were a kid, chances are you were perfectly happy and content without lighting up smokes. You're not giving up something you enjoy, you're escaping something that holds you back from actually enjoying life. Smoking doesn't fill a void in you, it creates one. If you want to escape this habit you have to truly want to to be successful. Once you accept that cigarettes don't fill the void of boredom, and that they don't make social events more fun than escaping can be quite enjoyable. This whole mindset of hating quitting something you enjoy is the main cause people find giving up smoking difficult. In reality the withdrawal symptoms are miniscule to the mental cage you've created for yourself towards smoking. Sometimes people find themselves smoking again after not having for weeks and they automatically feel shame. They think those weeks were wasted and now they've hit rock bottom. That's false, you went weeks with only having one smoke is the truth, not that it was time lost. Escaping is a process, and relapse is just as much a part of that process. It's time to tell that ugly nicotine monster to stfu and escape from him. You won't miss anything, you won't have less fun or joy in life. You won't have a void to fill after escaping since cigarettes cause that void in the first place.

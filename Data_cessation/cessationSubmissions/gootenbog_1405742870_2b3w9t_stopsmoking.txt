Fucking day 4

Every time I attempt quitting, I always think the first 3 days are the worst.

But it's day 4:
I start happy, get through most of my day and be fine until about 7. Then I see red for no reason. Then I get more perturbed, never remembering I am still withdrawing. By the time I am done escalating, I am demanding a cig and will do anything to get it.

I just calmed down. I remembered why I am quitting. I just made it through day 4.

Fuck day 4.

Been smokefree for 1 year with snus, just quit snus feel like shit.

So when I first quit smoking 1 year ago, I had smoked for about 8 years. I did feel very bad, frustration, headache, mucus, ringing in ears and eye pressure.

I decided to use swedish snus as a supplement for cigarettes, I did use them occasionally during when I smoked too. Made me not think about any cigarettes at all.

Problem is, I used 12 mg strenght, about 10-13 pouches a day that's about 156 mg of nicotine, I smoked LM blue's which contain 0.6 mg of nicotine per cigarettes and smoked about 10-15 of them. During the time I snused I got myself as much nicotine in that I would of if I smoked 13 packs of cigarettes a day.

Now I quit snus I feel extreme nausea, headache, tears in the eyes from the pressure of the headache, orange mucus, eye sensitivity, dripping in sweat, no sleep, no focus, no motivation, doing everything with 10% capacity.. My question is it related to quitting snus? It was alot worse than quitting the cigs..

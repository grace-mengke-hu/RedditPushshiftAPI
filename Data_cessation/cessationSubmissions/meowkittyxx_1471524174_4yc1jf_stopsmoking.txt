I quit for a week but I'm a anxious mess. Advice?

It's been a week smoke/nicotine free but I feel like a complete mess with my mental health. I get cravings but they're minor and I can ignore them. The anxiety though has been ongoing. Its fluctuates from minor to hyperventilating/panic attacks. I'm already on anti anxiety pills that I take daily but they've done absolutely nothing to decrease my anxiety. I tried exercise but it just makes the anxiety worst because I feel like I'm hyperventilating/on the verge of a panic attack from the breathing. I know I'm done smoking for good but I just don't know how to manage the anxiety. Its gotten to the point where I don't leave my house certain days because it's that bad. Any advice?

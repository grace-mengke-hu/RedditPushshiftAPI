Day 3 (or 'What I Hate About Smoking')

Hola,
Day 3 underway! Maybe just need a place to vent but I wanna let people know what I hate about smoking, and it's kind of different to what I've heard before. 

Before I started smoking there was not a single smoker around who could justify smoking for me. They'd say it was horrible. "Don't start." They hated themselves for doing it. That intrigued me. I tried smoking a cigarette. Didn't really like it.

But hey, it tasted pretty good with beer, so I was officially a social smoker. Then 4 a day. Then life got really busy and before I knew it I was doing a pack a day. But what no one told me? I LOVED IT. Smoking was AWESOME. It was the best thing that happened to me.

Stressed out? Smoke a cigarette. Happy? Smoke a cigarette. Just eaten? Cigarette. Coffee? Duh. I started associating everything with smoking, and I didn't hate it. That people said they "hate smoking" is a fucking lie. They hate being addicted. They love the sensation of smoking, full on. And I wish a smoker had been honest enough to say "I love smoking, but the addiction is horrible."

Now, health-wise I'm not too concerned. I probably should be. But I'm not quitting smoking for health reasons. I'm quitting smoking because I cannot stand the fact that I have to smoke obsessively. I can't even play video games without smoking anymore. Also my good friend's brother is staying with me. Being around me he started smoking behind my back and I realized it was too much, so I told him I'd quit if he did and he agreed, but that's just an added incentive. My actual reasoning is a lot more selfish than that. 

So yeah. 3 days. The fact that I rely on being able to smoke to get me through most situations is really what's killing me. 

TLDR; day 3. any smoker who tells you they hate smoking is lying. smoking is addictive because people actually enjoy it (aside from being actually chemically addictive).

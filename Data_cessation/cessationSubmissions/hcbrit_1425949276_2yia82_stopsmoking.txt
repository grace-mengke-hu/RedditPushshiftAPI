Take 3, Action!

So, after my last attempt I failed the next morning. Great.



I'm ill atm and I'm fed up of colds/sore throats lasting more than they need to. I haven't had a cigarette since 8th March because I'm ill and it's now the 10th, so I thought I would have another go. Lets see how this turns out.

40 days in... what's worked for me might work for those just starting out

I'm ecstatic to be getting back to normal (relapsed for 18 months after 8.5 years free)... much thanks to lurking around here.

One day, looking at the last smoke in my pack, I just didn't want to spend my last $10 for a few weeks on another pack.  So I smoked it, then fought the coming cravings one at a time.  I gave no thought whatever to getting the day done, getting a week done, a month, ect... only giving every fiber of my strength to absolutely getting through the current craving, no questions asked.  Any of us can get through one craving.

Once I started fighting cravings, I embarked on reading Allen Carr's Easyway (listened to audiobook when in bed)... it strengthened me, kept my motivation up, higher than I could sustain it myself in those early days, and it gave me ammunition against the incessant cravings.

Once I had about 5 or 6 days in, and was pretty much done the book, I found whyquit.com, and started reading [relapse prevention](http://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_Index_04_Relapse.html) articles, and while falling asleep each night, I listened to the related [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F05C03D0F9B86DB).

I kept that up for about 3 weeks... reading stuff off whyquit and listening to youtube each night.  I was a little obsessed really, but it helped and worked.

Eventually, it just wasn't an issue any more. 

So now that I'm free, I have to stay that way... and the single most important thing, is not to fall for the temptation of "just one"... every other of the 15 or so quits in my life, returned to full-blown smoking, because I thought I could handle just one.  

So if you're in your first week or so, keep it up, don't cave in, check out some of those resources... and it keeps getting better and easier, until it's all but gone.  

Hang in there!

Just can't seem to quit totally.

So I have been on Chantix for almost 8 weeks. I very quickly went from a pack or more a day to a pack and a half a week. I just can't seem to stop completely. I don't feel like I have an addiction anymore but I just can't shake the habit. Pick up the phone, light a cig. Start the truck, light a cig. 9:30 at work, light a cig. I tried the gum and it was horrible. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

1 week smoke free :)

So I'm 1 week smoke free, and it feels amazing! I haven't been this motivated about anything in a long time. I've failed at the week mark before, but this time feels different, like I know I'm going to continue to not smoke. 

Anyway, the main reason for this post is to say how much this sub has helped me the past week, I've been lurking mainly, but the positive attitude and support that is shown here is pretty amazing, so big up yourselves! 

As an aside, my 2 best friends also smoke(d), and since I made the decision to quit, one quit yesterday, and the other is contemplating quitting on the weekend, which'll hopefully result in all of us being non-smokers going forward :)

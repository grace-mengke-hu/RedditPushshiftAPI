100 Days if I could make it through this so can you.

I just wanted to drop in and let everyone know that it is possible to kick this habit.   I smoked 1 to 1.5 packs a day for about 16 years and tried to quit a lot.  I tried so many times I would give up trying for months or years.  But this last time it has stuck even though I am going through an extremely stressful time at work and working 6 and 7 days a week for the past 7 weeks. My wife still smokes, so there are cigarettes always around. I have went out drinking with people who smoke and yet though all of this here I am 100 days. 

What I found is just do it, dont think about it, just quit don't add a bunch of stress by saying tomorrow I am going to quit.  Everytime I set a date I would smoke and drink the night before to say goodbye but that never worked.  

Dont drink,  I used to drink all the time, but I gave up on it for 30 days and that helped a lot.

Exercise, I started running and I am up to 5 miles at a time something I couldn't do all through my 20s

The first week was rough but it gets easier,   I still think about them every day but its not the cravings that I used to get, just a thoight. I go almost all day without thinking about them now.  

To all those who have quit congrats.   To those thinking about it start now it will be hands down the best decion of your life.  Join me in not smoking.

I've apparently found the fountain of youth

So today I had to wake up really early and watch my three year old cousin. 

I woke up at 6:17 AM. Realized I had no cigarettes. Too bad, I had to watch this little half Asian kid until 1. No biggie, my mom leaves nicorette around everywhere. 

So I chew it, get through the day. Then by the time my uncle gets the kid, I realize: that's the longest I've gone without smoking (putting aside transatlantic flights) in 5 years. I should keep going!

So I come to this subreddit. I start clicking things. Get a feel for the place.

I see, mentioned for the nineteenth time in my life, Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking. Fine. I'll fucking read it. 

I read the entire thing, realized the dangers of nicorette, now experiencing my first withdrawals. No. Bueno.

I told my girlfriend what happened. She was ecstatic. I went to her place (we boned). 

Anyway, this has been the longest fucking day ever. Holy Christ. I feel like my life may have potentially changed, not sure yet. But seriously, if I could bottle this anxiety life would feel a lot longer. 

Something something little monster

(I can feel the withdrawals in my shoulders)

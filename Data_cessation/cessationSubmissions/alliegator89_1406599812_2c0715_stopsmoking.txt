Can't focus

Having a very hard time focusing tonight.  I am taking the GRE in less than 3 weeks (YIKES!!!).  Thoughts are creeping in my head like "just smoke one to help you concentrate" or "you picked a horrible time to quit...start again after the GRE."  Trying very hard to ignore them.  My husband has smokes in his pocket which makes it even harder to ignore the thoughts.  the cigarettes are right. there.  Need some encouragement.

Someone offered me a cigarette today and I said no! :D

Started working at my new job yesterday and there was just so much work, I was so stressed and about to just say fuck it and smoke one but I'm so happy now that I didn't - all of you were so right though, it gets so much easier after a while.

The 23 days badge isn't quite right though because I got drunk  last weekend, smoked a few with friends, spent the whole morning throwing up and since that night I'm pretty sure that I will make it this time, because I was totally disgusted by cigarettes and today proved that I'm right! :)

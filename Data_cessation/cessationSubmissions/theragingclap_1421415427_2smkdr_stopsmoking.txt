About coughing and the by product, not a pleasant topic so don't look if you don't like stuff like that.

I have started coughing up mucus with what looks like grains of black tar  I guess. It has happened 3 times in the last two days, it is a random deep cough which I am taking as good news. It is not blood or anything like that. The volume isn't particularly much and it leaves a taste of rancid cigarettes in my mouth.

Now I know I put this crap into my body in the first place but can anyone else just reassure my slightly addled brain that they have been through this too and how long it went on for. I did smoke a lot for a long time! In my previous quits I remember coughing but not much detail.

To everyone going through the quitting process and posting here or reading, stay strong and thanks for the inspiration.

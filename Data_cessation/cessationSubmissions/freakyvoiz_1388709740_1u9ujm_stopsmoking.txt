A month in, feeling so much better.

I quit smoking cigarettes right before thanksgiving, made the transition to vapor and have not looked back. I know alot of the people here don't agree with that avenue, but honestly it is probably the only thing that has gotten me this close to being completely done. 

I started out with 24mg of nicotine in my bottles, and now I'm down to 12mg. I'm halving it again with my next order and eventually will have the nicotine gone. My girlfriend loves that I don't smell like an ashtray and also loves that I either smell like cinnamon rolls, or mixed berries. This may not be way for everyone, but it is definetely the way for me. I feel better, I breathe easier, No cough, and I'm not even tempted to try a cigarette anymore. 

I never thought it was possible, but I'm so glad i've come this far.

This subreddit is what actualy made me take the next step towards being proactive about quitting. I want to thank all of you for that.

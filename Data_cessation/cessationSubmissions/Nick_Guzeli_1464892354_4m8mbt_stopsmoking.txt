Stumbled, but back up

I had quit 5/20, then attended a birthday on 5/27, and that's when I fell.. so my new quit date is 5/28... not proud, but not ashamed because I learned something. I wasn't forced, It was my doing, and it was repulsive... since then I have had zero cravings. Granted it's been only 5 days, but I feel stronger than before. Here's to 1 month and beyond!

Day 3 complete

After years of taking acid, ecstacy and weed as well as smoking I'm free from all drugs, I haven't smoked weed in 57 days and it's 3 days without a cigarette. I'm due back to work in 3 weeks time so I have plenty of time to adjust. I've heard some people say it's good to quit during usual stressful environments in our lives but I don't mind a running start. I have a few health supplements to aid me on my way as well as my ecigarette and im eating a lot more. I weigh 9st 5 about 134lbs 6ft so there's another reason to quit. I've been lurking on here for a little while and I'm enjoying the progress reports. Happy to be here, here's to healthy lungs :)

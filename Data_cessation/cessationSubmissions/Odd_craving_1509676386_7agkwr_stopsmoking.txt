Lurker non-smoker with an observation.

I've never smoked, yet I was drawn to this sub after my heart transplant 11/1/14. Yes, yesterday was my 3 year heartversary. 

As I was getting my artificial heart installed, honestly, the odds of making it to transplant weren't in my favor. Then I had a stroke. Somehow I hung in and lived a year with the artificial heart and I finally got the call. 

When I see people harming their heart and other organs, I get angry. But reading this sub has educated me about the struggle. I really applaud this sub and it represents! Living without tobacco literally means life for so many. Kids will have their parents and grandparents will be able to watch their grandchildren grow up.

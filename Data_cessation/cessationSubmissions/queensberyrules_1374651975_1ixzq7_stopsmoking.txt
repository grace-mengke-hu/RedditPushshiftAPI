TIPS ON CRAVINGS?

almost at the big ONE MONTH.. basically going to a long weekend getaway with the guys (half of who smoke).. how should I crush my cravings during triggers ie. drinking, club.. I've been good these 28 days because I stayed away from smokers (even at work) but I have I feeling I'll be tested this weekend... how are the e-cigs? do they really work and are safe? THANKS NON-SMOKERS

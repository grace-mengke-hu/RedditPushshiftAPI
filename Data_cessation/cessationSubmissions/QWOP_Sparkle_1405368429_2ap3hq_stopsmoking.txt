I plan to quit again this Friday...

Originally, I quit solid for a good 9 months and everything was fine. A lot of bad things hit me all at once and I just didn't care anymore and hit up smoking again in November time last year.

All the stressful things have pretty much gone now, so I'm praying that it'll be an easy escape for me.

I'm using vaping and nicorettes as a way out of it. They worked last time so hopefully they'll work this time!

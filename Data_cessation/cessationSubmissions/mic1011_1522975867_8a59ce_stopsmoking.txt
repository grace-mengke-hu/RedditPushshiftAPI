Going back to smoking and being happy about it as well.

Have any of you lurkers out there quit for a period of time, just to go back to smoking because you decided that you actually enjoyed smoking at times and chose to just do it, and actually didn't regret it a whole lot?   Does quitting successfully and then regretting it happen? I know that some people say they'd love a cigarette with their coffee 30 years after quitting.  I kind of don't feel like craving cigarettes for 30 years every time I have coffee, that's why i'm asking.

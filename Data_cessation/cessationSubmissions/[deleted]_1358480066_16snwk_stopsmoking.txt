I quit last week its been a long seven days but i know by the end of this year i will be so happy :) 

Me and my girlfriend decided to quit and take u working out and going to the gym together to replace the bad habit. So far its been a week and i feel so much better, ive been breathing better and actually tasting my food and smelling the smells again. Im gonna make it this year even if it kills me :D This is an awesome subreddit and i feel itll help me stay even more motivated!

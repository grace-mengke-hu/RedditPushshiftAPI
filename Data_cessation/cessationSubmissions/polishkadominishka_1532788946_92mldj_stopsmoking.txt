Alen Carr’method trouble

Hi everyone,
I have a question especially for those who quit with Carr’s method. I read the book, several times and two days ago I did all the instructions and put out my final cigarette (at least what I thought to be my final cigarette). First day went pretty good, no smoking but in the evening a craving came out, it was intense, I started crying and I thought what the hell, this was supposed to be easy right ? I smoked, hated myself and now here I am wondering if this is normal?! How were your first days of quitting? If it’s the easy method then why was I crying my eyes out ?
When I stopped crying the craving passed but I still lit up that b***tch...
I don’t know what to do. For those who read the book you know the willpower isn’t supposed to be the way.
I would really appreciate any comment.

day 11: all the things I tried to escape from back when I was 14 are coming back

fuck. I feel horrible.
and the therapist of whom I wasn't even convinced in the first place canceled the appointment. 

On the one hand it's ok and probably for the best and a sign that I should trust my instincts.
On the other hand fuck I have to wait until September until a good therapist can help me.

How much of this is the craving still? I mean I definitely need help beyond this but I'll relax more and more right?

I'm completely sober right now. And I plan on staying that way. I don't even drink soda. I eat fucking fruit all day and nuts.

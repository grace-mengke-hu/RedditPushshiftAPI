What worked for me.

I seem to be doing quite well this time around so I thought I'd share a few things that really helped me.  

Firstly - no nicotine replacement, for me this just feels like giving up chocolate by eating just enough chocolate per day to drive you insane with the desire for more chocolate.

"Knock on wood" - whenever I got a craving I would just knock on the table or gently slap my thigh or something similar.  For me this served  to identify and acknowledge that I was having a craving for nicotine because sometimes they're really subtle and you don't realise what's happening.  I found that once I'd identified the craving and "named the beast" it was a lot easier to ride it out; once you know what's bothering you it's a whole load easier to face it down.

Keep the cash - Every day I put the price of 20 ciggies into a savings account and whenever I wanted something I bought it out of that money I'd saved; effectively I used my ciggie money as pocket money for treats so I never felt deprived.

If there was one thing that really helped me stay off them though it's this;  I kinda re-framed my situation and acknowledged that I was a nicotine addict.  Instead of being a smoker that was trying to quit I thought of myself as a nicotine addict trying to get clean...that change in perception has really helped.

It's not easy to quit but after the first eight days it  got much, MUCH easier for me.  I still get the odd craving but i knock on wood, acknowledge it and move on.  

Good luck getting clean everyone :)

it gets better. but...

yay its been 76 days. though i honestly don't care how long i stay quit. time alone don't really change much. during a crave episode it feels as if it will never get any better but it does. craving is very similar to hunger for food for me. the worst part is that eating doesn't make it go away. it only makes it worse.i am open to any suggestions .what should i do when i feel that strong hunger.
finally. whether i have craving or no , i think about smoking all the time. i am not tempted or anything . something reminds me that i quit smoking . I'd love to move on.

F 25, been smoking since I was 18, decided to quit a week ago after I watched my dad dying in the ER with only half a lung left.

He'd been smoking for 50 years, 2 packs a day, no cancer included, his lungs just literally stopped working. First his right lung died completely and then a week later his other lung gave up too. You never think it'll happen to someone you know, but, oh well. I've decided to quit, his last wish was for me to quit. Wish me luck I guess. I crave it so badly.

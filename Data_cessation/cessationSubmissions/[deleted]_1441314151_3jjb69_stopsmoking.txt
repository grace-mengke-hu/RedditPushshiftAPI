Need support

I was directed to this subreddit and am gonna need some support.  I've been a pack a day smoker for 10 years. Im gonna quit smoking. Cold turkey. Tried half assed-ly a few yrs ago and made it to a week but was feeling very sick. No games. No vapes. No patches.  Maybe terrible gum for an emergency. I feel motivated but honestly very afraid. Any support or advice will help. I'll keep you all updated. Especially on my work breaks. Thanks in advance.

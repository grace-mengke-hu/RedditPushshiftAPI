Crying everyday since I stopped my Vape

Hi everyone. 
I have stopped using my vape and threw it away between 24-48hours ago. 
I’ve been crying every couple of hours. I just woke up and I’m in bed and 30 min later I cry some more. 
Just memories and things in the past that hurt me coming back. Or thinking of my uncle and grandpa who died when I was younger, who I really loved. Just a mixture of everything... 
I know that being emotional is a symptom of recovery. 
And I’ll let it take its course.
It is what it is... idk....

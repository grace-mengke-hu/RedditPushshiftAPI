7 days - feeling scared.

I've been smoking all my adult life, for almost 15 years now. Been clean for a week. In my case there's always this feeling of satisfaction and reward at this particular time. I have beaten the cravings for 7 days straight (helping myself w/ cytisine pills but still). I feel free and confident and am already enjoying the benefits of not stinking and having extra cash. And I really want to quit. 

Then there's the wall. 

After two or three weeks from now my resolve will drop. Just a little bit. And I will dream about smoking and think about this one tiny deathstick, only one. I will see somebody smoking, I will remember how they taste with the morning coffee. I'll keep resisting but will get weaker every day until I break. It's all downhill from there. 

I know it's all in my head but I can't help myself. 

I feel like a hypocrite. Telling my wife I will stay tough this time. But we both remember this is the seventh time I'm trying in last two years. It's like there's always an invisible wall I can't go through no matter what I do. 

Best part: I don't feel like smoking anytime soon. I'm just scared of what's ahead of me because I've been there and I don't know what to do. 

Does anyone here encounter a crisis anywhere between day 30-60? Is it usual? Do you have any advice?  I'm exercising more and treating myself with snacks instead of cigarettes while craving but I feel I'm heading in the same direction once again.

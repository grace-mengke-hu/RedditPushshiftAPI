60 days &amp; feeling accomplished

Hi fellow quitters and aspiring quitters! It’s Day 60 for me and I wanted to share something about my experience so far.

One thing that kept me afraid of quitting in the past (I smoked 1/2 pack a day for nearly 20 years) was the fear of gaining weight. In the year or so before quitting, due to medication and some lifestyle changes, I had gained 25-30 lbs (a lot for my size; I’m F/5’3”) and I was terrified that quitting would make it worse.

But I quit anyway. And exactly three weeks after I quit smoking, I felt SO proud of myself for being able to quit, that I started CICO for weight loss. Since then I have actually lost 5-6 lbs and I’m well on my way to my goal weight. And it feels so great!

For me, feeling out of control with my smoking was a constant blow to my self esteem. And by quitting I felt in control of my own life and my own wellness in a way that I honestly never felt before. 

My next goal is to add in more exercise. I’m taking it one step at a time to improve myself. Another factor is that I’ve been working on my mental health for the past six months or so, through therapy. I think that helped tremendously as well. 

Anyway I hope this helps to inspire others to take the plunge on your own wellness journey. It’s worth it. YOU are worth it. And you’ll be so glad you did.

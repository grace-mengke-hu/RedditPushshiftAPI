Need a little help. birthday soon, and I want to quit now.

PLEASE DONT MAKE FUN OF ME but I never smoked too much to begin with, since I turned 19 (21 now), like clockwork, I've smoked 2-3 cigarettes a day almost every day, finishing a pack took me like 2 weeks or sometimes 3 weeks, I'd have coffee and cigarettes after work most days, and I never smoked enough to "get used" the the little brain tickle of nicotine. but when i would quit, i'd be irritable, just a little, and a week or two later, something would stress me out at school or work (i make eyeglasses in a lab and machines break and shit happens) and i'd be back on. 

Like I said, I'm not a pack a day or anything, but i love the calm after a cigarette, I love beer and cigarettes, coffee and cigarettes, talking with people and smoking, and i realise I'm addicted. my dad and grandmother smoked before me, she got cancer, my dad has asthma, I know it's only gonna hurt me in the end eventually and i wanna stop before it gets worse.

My first day was difficult you guys

I couldn't believe myself when it happened, but I had hallucinations five minutes into the future of me smoking. It happened on a number of occasions. I couldn't sleep for more the two and a half hours without waking up. My weapon was the word NO. Now I really want to kick the habit. I really hope it gets easier after the first day.

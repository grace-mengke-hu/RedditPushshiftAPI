How long does the brain fog last

Today is one month, and the brain fog is still awful. Last week my husband and I had to make the very difficult decision that I can't drive until it passes after I popped a curb ($400 mistake). I  can't focus on anything, and I'm frustrated that everything is in a fog. When does it usually pass?

It's been about two months. Today, I took my ash bucket off the front porch and threw it away.

It wasn't a trigger, or anything. I go to meetings (unrelated to smoking) three days a week, and stand with the smokers (well, they're *all* smokers) during breaks. It's fine. But leaving it on my front porch sent the wrong message, and it was time to get rid of it.

I still keep the last pack I bought, empty, of course, on a shelf as a reminder that I'm not wasting fifty bucks a week on cigarettes.

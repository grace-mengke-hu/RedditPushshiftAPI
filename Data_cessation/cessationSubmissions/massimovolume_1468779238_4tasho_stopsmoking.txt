almost a week...

I quit smoking just a week ago, I'm feeling pretty fine and my cravings are not that bad, however i would like to know if is it normal feeling kind of uneasy and a little anxiety? I also noticed since I quit smoking I feel a little more sad and I'm more depressed. I'm not depressed because I can't smoke anymore, but seems like since I quit my problems are bigger, more severe, more important.
Unfortunately I suffer of depression so quitting smoking might temporarily worsen the situation.
Thanks for your help and good sunday :)

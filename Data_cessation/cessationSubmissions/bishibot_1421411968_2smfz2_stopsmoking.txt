Has anyone else experienced this?

I have been a fairly heavy smoker for the last 8 years. On monday I got a pretty sore throat and decided to try not smoking. Today, I still have absolutely zero cravings and have not smoked since monday. I have tried this before and failed miserably. For some reason though it has been extremely easy to stay away from cigarettes this week. Even last year when my throat started getting sore and I felt like shit, I would still sneak a smoke or two out of desperation, but this week, nothing. 
Whats going on here lol? How has my attitude changed so much that I don't even feel any physical or mental cravings?

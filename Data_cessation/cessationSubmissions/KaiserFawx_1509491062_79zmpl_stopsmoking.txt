My quit day is tomorrow...

My quit day is tomorrow and I'm sitting on my patio with the last cigarette I will (hopefully) ever smoke in an empty pack on the table in front of me. I'm trying to tell myself not to make a big deal of it and wind up idolizing (not sure if that's the right term) it.
         
         
I have tried to quit so many times before that I've lost count. I read the post by u/simonishome about how he quit on Halloween so that the month of November will tick the days in succession to count his days of being quit and decided to do the same.
        
        
I really hope I have the strength this time...

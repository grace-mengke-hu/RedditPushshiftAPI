I need some help

Hey everyone, 

I just found this sub because I just broke after 4 days and had a cigarette, feeling ashamed, and I thought hey, reddit has everything, there's probably a group of people who have quit/are trying to quit. 

I've been nearing half a pack a day, though admittedly I don't like to keep track exactly. I work nearly 40 hours per week at a bar with one of my two roommates, who smokes about as much. He's not planning to quit currently. So as you might imagine the environment is not ideal for quitting. 

I tried recently to get a block of 4 days off work in a row and just power through, but getting all those days off are near impossible. I ended up getting two days, then a work day, then one more day off. I got through those first two by shivering undering my covers and coming out of my room only when necessary, and I even made it through the next long day at work. It took all my will power to go straight to bed without a cig when I got home.

It was the next day that got me(today). I just couldn't do it. I've been anxious, angry, it was all I could think about. Just sitting alone at home, with my roommates pack on the counter, and I broke.

Does anyone have advice? Or experience with quitting in an environment where friends and coworkers smoke daily too? I'm feeling like success is far away at this point.

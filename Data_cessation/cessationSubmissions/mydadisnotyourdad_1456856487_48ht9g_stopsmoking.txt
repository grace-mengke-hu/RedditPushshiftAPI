One month!

It's only a month, but I wanted to wait to report any progress until now. I still get cravings, I still think I would enjoy a cigarette but then I remind myself that I can run 4 miles without stopping and average close to 8:00 min/mi. I remind myself that whether I smoke or not, the craving will pass. It gets better everyday, but it is still a challenge. To everyone who has decided to quit, I'm proud of you and wish you many more smoke-free days.

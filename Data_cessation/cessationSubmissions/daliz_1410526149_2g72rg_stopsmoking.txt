Today is my day, guys. But I need an advice.

Ten years of smoking, twenty cigs a day (sometimes more).

In the latest months I've been experiencing some breathing problems... Nothing serious but I feel like if my lungs can't handle too much (or the regular amount of) air.

I'm moving to another country to start a new job one week from now and I'm seriously motivated to begin this adventure. I'm just scared of one thing: what are the chances of developing the "quitter's flu" or worsening my breathing problems? It would be a really bad way to start the new job.

I know it may sound like the nicotine "suggesting" me to keep smoking, and probably it is. But I'm seriously concerned about the stress I'm going to experience in the next days and weeks and I'm worried that it's not really the best moment to quit.

What do you guys think?

Thank you!

UPDATE: Guys, I have no words except: Thank you. I'm going to read your words again and again in the following days because they give me the boost I need.

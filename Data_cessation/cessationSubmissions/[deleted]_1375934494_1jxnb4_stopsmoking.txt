Little bit of help

Hello all,
I have never been a pack a day smoker or anything like that. In fact, I have only averaged about once a week. But when I do it, I binge. It's bad. Lately I've been craving to do it more and I can see this getting out of hand real fast. I need to nip this in the bud before it really becomes a terrible habit.
For you brave souls that have quit, what things other than lozenges or ecigarettes have you tried that you have found success with? I thought about a reward system or something of that nature, but wanted to ask what has worked for you guys. 

I appreciate the support and am inspired by you guys daily.

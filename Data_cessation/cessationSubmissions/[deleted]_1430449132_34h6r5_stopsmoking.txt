Does anyone have tips (or experience) to avoid smoking again when facing difficult/emotional situations?

Hi, I have been smoke free for 21 days now. But this night my mom tried to commit suicide. Totally numb from the sedation drugs and alcohol, we got her to the hospital by ambulance. When I was waiting I seriously feeled to urge to go the night shop nearby and buy cigarettes again... Luckilly it was already closed and the cravings are, for now. My mom is sleeping in the hospital and she is "fine". But i fear for the next days, when she wakes up and finds herself in the hospital not knowing what happened... This might seem like an "over the top" story, but if somoene has some tips (or experience) for me to get through situations like these smoke free?
That would be a great help... Thanks!

Quitting Snus: Motivation, Focus, and Energy Issues

I'm a couple of weeks out and still having motivation, energy, and focus issues, especially at work.  Is this normal?

What else have helped people with this?  The cravings have subsided but I still don't feel right.  Maybe this is my natural state without a stimulant?  I hope not... I've been sleeping fine.

I do have some vacation coming up which I'm hoping will help.

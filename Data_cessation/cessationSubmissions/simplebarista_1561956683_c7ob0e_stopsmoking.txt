In need of some support

I’ve just quit smoking about 2 days ago. My symptoms of withdrawal are pretty bad. I feel nauseous all the time but I don’t want to throw up because I don’t want to feel like that is the only solution. I have a lot of other symptoms as well and it’s hard to deal with because I work almost every day this week. How long will it take for these symptoms to go away? They are almost unbearable but I don’t want to go back to smoking I really want to be healthier

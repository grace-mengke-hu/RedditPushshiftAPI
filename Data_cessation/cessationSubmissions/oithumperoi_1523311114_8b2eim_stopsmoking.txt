Dropping NRT and vaping today

Hey, everyone, this is my first post here =) I woke up this morning and decided not to vape or chew any gum after being quit for 17 days. I just don't really feel like it. I definitely have withdrawal symptoms, but also, just like a weird block about it. So I think I'm just gonna run with it, and see what happens. I didn't give away my stuff or anything, so if I DO relapse, I have options that aren't smoking cigarettes. 

Anyway, just popped in for some advice and encouragement. For some background info, I'm 27 and I've been smoking about 13 years.

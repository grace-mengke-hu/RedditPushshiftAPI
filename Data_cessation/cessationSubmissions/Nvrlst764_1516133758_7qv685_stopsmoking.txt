Huge craving. I didn't give in.

Just made it a full 24 hours smoke free as I was sitting outside the gas station contemplating going in and buying cigarettes. I sat outside a good 5 minutes going between this subreddit and the smoke free app before I pulled off. I kept thinking about something I learned in here- That when you are having a craving, wait 5 more minutes before you do some stupid shit and smoke. You can feel a lot of emotions in 5 minutes and usually you won't want to smoke after that time is up. When the craving passed and I was thinking semi straight again I was able to pull off and go about my day. I had been smoke free for over a month when I caved and bought a pack a week ago. I hated myself every time I lit one and I was doing this thing daily where I would smoke a few out of a pack and then wet them so I couldn't smoke any more. Then the following morning I'd go buy a pack, then hate myself and wet them again. Insanity is what that is. The nicotine addiction is real and it comes right back when you smoke only one.

Doing it!

You're the first "people" I've told. But I just passed 4 days smoke free. Took Chantix but didn't seem to work for me. But having 2 teeth pulled did. Had my last cig on 12/29 at 2:59pm before appt! Gotta do this. Money, smell, health, cough, future. So worth the few weeks of cravings. Apps help a lot. I'm using Smoke Free app and My Last Cig app. 

Anyone out there struggling- you can do it. Breathe through the cravings, eat - who cares if you gain a few pounds if you give yourself more life to live, carry a cinnamon stick in your hand and suck on it if you need to. We can do it!!!

I've been waiting for this day for 364 days....year anniversary, thanks to /rstopsmoking and the community.

I quit cold turkey a year ago today, after waking up just feeling like I had smoked so many cigarettes that I was bored to even smoke another.  I decided that I wanted to see what life was like without smoking...of course like many of you, it's gotten better.  Some things that helped me a lot:

I bike every day, and started to go on long rides 3-4 times a week.

Exercise, I hired a friend who is a personal trainer and had two sessions.  I've been following what he taught me for a year.

Pushing my addiction towards other things.  Part of having an addictive personality can be very beneficial.  I write a lot in my free time and have nearly written my first decent novel in my life, but even more so I've pushed my addiction towards writing, reading, going to live events, and so on, and have stayed very busy.

During this last year I have often visited some of my favorite bars that still allow smoking here, although each time I stay less and less as the smoking really has bothered me.

Good luck to all the quitters

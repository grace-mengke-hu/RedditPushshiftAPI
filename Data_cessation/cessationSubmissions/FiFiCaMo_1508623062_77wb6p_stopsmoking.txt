10 days quitting smoking and I kept sneaking ciggies. Determined TODAY to be smoke-free &amp; I'm coming here to be accountable. Would love encouragement - Can't seem to find it in my support network, they r going thru their own things. My first post on Redit.. I thought I'd reach out to into the web xx

Last time I quit I put on 40 kgs of weight. 
Ive almost lost all of it. 
I've just started cross-fit and I want my lungs to feel like they can keep up with the intensity. 
I am motivated to change my life. 
I have a vision for myself - where I can run &amp; dance &amp; feel good in my skin &amp; clothes. 
I've just spent two weeks sorting out my house to create a good space - including making space in my wardrobe dedicated to active-wear. 
I am inspiring myself by doing this!! 
Cigarettes were my down time.. 
I need a new habit here. 
I want to achieve my vision &amp; be free from the chains of addiction. 
I have been feeling bloody wonderful after exercising - I don't want them cigarettes to sabotage my request for inner happiness! 
Thanks for your encouragement in advance!!

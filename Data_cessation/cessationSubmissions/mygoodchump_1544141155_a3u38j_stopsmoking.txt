Does vaping count in this sub?

So earlier this year I picked up vaping. why? Because before I got this job I smoked weed several days a week. Maybe it’s an oral fixation; whatever it is I used vaping as a replacement. I learned tricks, discovered a wide selection of flavors, all that Jazz. 

Well at this point I wake up, hit it several times before work. Lunch break I hit it. After work it’s a non stop chain until I hit the bed. 

Is this an addiction? Should I be as worried as I am? I never really take “smoke breaks”. I mean yeah sometimes I use it as an excuse to leave wherever I am or whatever. 

Thanks for reading, I know many smokers switch to vaping to quit but I never smoked tobacco seriously.

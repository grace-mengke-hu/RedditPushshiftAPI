After 9 years

Finally, I felt a cigarette disgust me. Iâ€™m on day 5 of a retry of quitting. I gave in last time on day 5, but, it felt and tasted horrible. The way I smelled after made me feel even worse. 
I think I finally am ready to quit for good. 
Also curious, whether you vape or quit cold turkey, or insert nicotine replacement here; what do you do when you feel a strong craving come on for a real smoke?

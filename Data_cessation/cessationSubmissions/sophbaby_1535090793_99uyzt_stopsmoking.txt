Feel like a massive failure.

On the same day I got my ‘one month smoke free’ badge, I got very drunk, went out with friends, and before I had time to talk myself out of i had accepted a smoke from someone, lit it and smoked it. Then thought ‘fuck it I’ve already failed I’ll have another.’ As I was doing it, the smoke burnt my lungs, my mouth felt dry, and I didn’t enjoy it whatsoever. But whether I enjoyed it or not doesn’t matter because I still made the choice to do it. 

I woke up the next morning with a mouth that felt like an ash tray and never felt so disappointed and angry with myself. I had PROMISED myself ‘not one puff no matter what’ and a bit of alcohol and I completely gave up on all my hard work without hesitation. I really thought I was ready to stop being a hermit and go out and socialise. I thought I could trust myself. 

I logged that I had smoked in the app and it asked me if I wanted to reset or keep going. I chose to keep going but now I feel like a fraud. It says I’ve been smoke free for one month and 5 days but I know that a week ago I was drunk and smoking a cigarette. I feel like wiping my progress will wipe all of my motivation to continue. Seriously contemplating just going and buying a pack because I’ve already ruined my hard work with that drunken decision. 

Just needed to vent.

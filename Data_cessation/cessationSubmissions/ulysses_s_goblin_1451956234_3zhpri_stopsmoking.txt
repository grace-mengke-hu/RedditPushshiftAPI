Struggling to write and I'd really like a smoke

Typically when I hit a rough spot in my writing I step outside for a cigarette to take a break, collect my thoughts, and brainstorm. Now that I am three days into my quit I am stuck and stranded and so distracted by the fact that I cannot have a cigarette. I want to quit smoking, therefore I do not want this cigarette, but I also, paradoxically, really really want a cigarette. 

I'm not going to smoke today. I'm going to get through this craving. I don't need cigarettes to write. I'm going to finish this grad school personal statement.

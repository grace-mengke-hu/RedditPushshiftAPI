What do you think of smoking regulations? Do they help you? Are they meaningful?

This is more a matter of curiosity. I live in a place that taxes tobacco products very highly, and has laws around where you can smoke (eg not where food is being served). More and more places are doing this, and while I think itâ€™s helpful to denormalise smoking (and have extra incentives to quit) I never really felt like it made a difference to me when I was a smoker. 

I also feel like while pricing people out of smoking is effective in some ways, it certainly makes it hard for people w less financial resources who are still struggling to quit. 

Most of my friends who still smoke hate these laws, and I was wondering what r/stopsmoking thought about them. Opinions?

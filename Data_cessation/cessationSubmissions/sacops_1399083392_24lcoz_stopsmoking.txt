Day #2

Its day two. My roommate smokes and every time she goes outside for a cigarette I want to punch baby jesus in the face. I'm using welbutrin to help, and it is... a bit. The pills really just take the edge off. I know I'm stronger than the smokes, I started smoking at 15, now at 35 its time to prove it. Please tell me the angst and urge to punch infant deities in the face will subside. . .

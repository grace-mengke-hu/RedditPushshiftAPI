Day #28

I'm just going to ramble a bit here. Still having cravings and I'm still saying no no no. I've been trying to imagine what its going to be like when I don't think about the little bastards day in and day out. I can't wait til I don't count the days anymore. That's when I'll feel free of this evil attrocity perpetuated upon me by the greedy tobacco conglomerates and my own treacherous, addicted brain. Today I have once again chosen not to smoke. I refuse to fund those death dealers. I refuse to be stupid enough to be addicted to something that doesn't even get me high. I mean WTF have I been thinking all these years?! Right now I don't feel like I'm fighting a war. I feel like I'm winning a war. I'm grateful I found the courage to try.
Big Fat Proud Mama Moment
My daughter quit smoking 2 days ago!!! I am so proud of her. She is 21 and I found out she smoked when she was 17. I cried for days when I found out. It has been in my mind my greatest failure as a mother. She probably thinks I fucked something else up royally but that's between her and her shrink. Lol
Well happy Saturday all! I am so freaking happy to be a non smoker with you today!

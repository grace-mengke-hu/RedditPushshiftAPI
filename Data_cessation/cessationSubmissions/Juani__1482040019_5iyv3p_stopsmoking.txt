I fucking quit.

I started smoking when i was 15. I went to a military high school and there i had a "best buddy", he got some cigs from the gas station. Thats when i started, and sincirely, the moments that i am most fond of are of us smoking looking at the sky in the middle of nothing.

Now im 18, and i have being arguing with my mom for a pack of cigs for almost an hour (its 2 am now) and that made me realize that ive become seriously adicted.

I talked with my best friend but she doesnt quite get how i feel: Ashamed. I feel petty, stupid, the tinniest man in the world. Now i think of the times i used to hold a cig as if it was cool.

I just want to hear from you, i think i will get the kind of words i need here.

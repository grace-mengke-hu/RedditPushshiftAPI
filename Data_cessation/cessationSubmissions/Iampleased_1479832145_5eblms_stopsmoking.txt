Dawn of the First Day

I'm sick of coughing. I'm sick of it affecting my work. I'm sick of smelling bad. I'm sick of substituting it for healthy eating. I've managed to quit before but I forgot how nasty of a habit it is and how you aren't safe from the addiction just because you've been cigarette free for a while. Wishing all the current quitters luck.

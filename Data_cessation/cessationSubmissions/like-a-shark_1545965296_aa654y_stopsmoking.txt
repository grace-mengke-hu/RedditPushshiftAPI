Picked the wrong month to quit smoking... but I'm still not smoking.

I'm sure you don't want to hear my laundry list of complaints. December can be a rough month for a lot of people. But I hope I can drop by with a little friendly motivation. 

I'm on day 19 of being a non-smoker. Day 3 or 4 without the Nicorette lozenges. It's also been one of the more stressful 19 days regardless of quitting. I've survived job interviews, holidays, work crunch time, arguments, beers, tears, sicknesses, all without a cigarette.

I was under the impression quitting would make me a grump. But instead I find myself an emotional hurricane. A stark contrast to the flatlined depression I've been feeling for months leading up to this. I'm feeling my feelings and I'm getting by. 

So if you're reading this and you have something in your life that sounds a little too stressful without smoking... I can wholeheartedly promise you the harder it was to get through it without smoking the prouder you will be. And the more confident you will be moving forward. I started thinking I'd never be able to survive a normal work day without a smoke. I've proven to myself I can thrive in the nastiest of workdays. 

Hope this is encouraging to someone. Good luck out there. We almost made it through the year :)

My name is Dave and I really want/need to quit.

Hey all, I'm 23 and I've been smoking for 5 years. I'm posting here cause I don't really know what else to do that can get me to stop smoking... A few days ago I tried not smoking but 2 days later I went and bought a pack. 

I've been reading through this subreddit for a while now and the amount of motivated people is super awesome, all the posts, comments, pep talks... 

I'm not sure what more to add to my post so I'm gonna stop here I guess.

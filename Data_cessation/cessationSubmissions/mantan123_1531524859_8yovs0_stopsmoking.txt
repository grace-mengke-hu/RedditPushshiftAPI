Day 3

Day 3, not my first rodeo (usually cave around the 1 month mark every time for some reason??), but this one has been particularly rough on my depression. Guess I'm posting this partly for accountability, partly to feel less insane, lol idek. Anyways, wish me luck. I'll be doing the same for you all!

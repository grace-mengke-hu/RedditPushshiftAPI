I am an idiot

So last night I went out. I knew I was going to get smashed so I bought a vape (I'm on patches). I smoked 2 actual cigarettes on my way home. They tasted awful. Haven't had a vape or cigarette all day. Still have the patch. Feeling alright (no craving at all) but angry at myself. Should I restart the smoking app (today was day 8)? Thanks

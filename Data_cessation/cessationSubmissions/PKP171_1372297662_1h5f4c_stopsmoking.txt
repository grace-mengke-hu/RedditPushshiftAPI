Almost 4 days in and looking for support.

Hey non-smokers.  I just decided on Sunday that I was going to give up this wretched habit.  It's partially due to the fact that I've had a couple of health scares (heart palpitations and dizziness), but also because I just don't feel good when I smoke anymore.  I know I can be a faster hockey player with more endurance.  It's been 10 years since I started but I'm done.

To solidify this commitment, I decided to go out and buy a chromebook (which I'm typing this on) as a reminder of the better things I can spend my money on.

So far, I'm not having a ton of trouble, and I've avoided a lot of my friends who smoke.  There are still certain things that really make me want a cigarette, even though I know I'll feel like shit if I have one.  What are some of the best ways that you guys get over the cravings or at least curb them?

40 days today

Today is day 40 apparently. I'm still on the champix but am only taking a half dose, mostly because I keep forgetting to take the second tablet.

It's gotten a lot easier, I even went out friday night for some beers and didn't end up a heap in the corner wanting a smoke. I've gained some weight, but to be honest I probably needed to. Things are good, I smell things a lot more. I don't "feel" healthier but I feel better if that makes sense. Thank you to everyone here for your continued support, it really does help to read through success stories and to know people are struggling like I have.

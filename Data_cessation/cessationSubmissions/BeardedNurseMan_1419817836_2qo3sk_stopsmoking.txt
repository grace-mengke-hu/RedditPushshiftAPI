Need some advice or helpful words.

I quit using tobacco on 12/12/14. I was a chewer/ snuser for 6 years off and on. The first few days were absolutely horrible. Anxiety, depression and attention/ memory problems. I also fixated on issues which just made the anxiety worse. Seeing as though I am 2 weeks out I can say that I think the symptoms are getting better but it feels like it has been forever. Sometimes I think I am going to stay this way. The last few days with family stressed me out and led me to tears multiple times. Although one day I ran 5 miles (personal best) there are times when I feel as though I cant think and I get panicky for a snus. I also feel wiped out and mentally foggy on a daily basis. How did it go when you quit? Has anyone had these same symptoms that would have any helpful advice?

I lost my motivation and smoked on day 3! HELP!

I quit smoking for New Years. My boyfriend and I had made a deal that if I stop smoking then we could get a dog, that was my motivation! I've wanted a dog for a few years now so I finally decided to quit to get what I wanted! Then on day 3 my boyfriend tells me that he's not ready for a dog as they are a lot of work.. Hearing that was almost like tearing the verbal contract we had made and so I went straight to my local garage and bought a pack, I've now smoked 5 since last night! I'm so annoyed at myself because I had quit for 3 days and now that feels so wasted! I have lost my motivation to stay smoke free, what can I do?

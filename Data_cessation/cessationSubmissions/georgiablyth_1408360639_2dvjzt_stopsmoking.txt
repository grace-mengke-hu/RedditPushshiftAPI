Nicotine and the other stuff.

When quitting smoking in the past, I would get through the first week (which was tough), but from then it got easier, until about 28 days in. I would have an uncontrollable urge to smoke and this happened every time that I quit.

So, I bought an electronic cigarette and have switched to that for about 6 weeks now. I still had a pretty bad urge at 28 days in for a couple days, but I had nicotine so it made it easier, now in the future when I get off the electronic cigarette, it should be easier.

My theory is the other shit that they put in cigarettes (I smoked marlboros, the most chemicalled up cigs) makes them more addictive, get off these chemicals, then ditch the nicotine.

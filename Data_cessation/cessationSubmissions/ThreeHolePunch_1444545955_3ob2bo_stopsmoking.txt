444 Days without nicotine!

I smoked for 17 years. I tried to quit once with nicotine gum and managed to quit for 3 months. I used lozenges and got 7 months before giving in to it. I tried a cheap, gas station e-cig once but I got nothing from it so didn't quit at all. Those were the only three serious quit attempts I made as a smoker (though I'm not counting 3 days or less without a cig as a *serious attempt*)

I heard about this sub last year and found out about *Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking* from some ones post on here. I found the experience of quitting while reading that book fairly comfortable. I found reading this sub to be helpful in the early days of quitting. I had some minor issues with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for the first three to six months of quitting and this sub helped me deal with some of that. These days I'm feeling pretty good about life in general and life as a non-smoker especially. The urges I have are extremely fleeting. I have no doubts that I am now a *former smoker* for the rest of my life. 

Thanks to everyone who works on this sub and everyone who contributes to it.

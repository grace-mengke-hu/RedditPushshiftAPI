Help please, failing constantly.

Forgive me for ranting, so I have been trying to quit for a long while now, with no luck. I always go 2-3 days, sometimes 6-7 before relapsing. I make excuses and end up giving in. I am fed up. I don't want to get into the next year as a smoker. Any advice? Thank you. I am starting again, and this time, I am going to post here every single day, to keep myself committed to this.

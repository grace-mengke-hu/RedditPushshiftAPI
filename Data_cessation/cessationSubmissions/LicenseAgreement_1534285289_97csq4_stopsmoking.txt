It feels like tearing out part of my existance

I know how dramatic the title sounds but it seriously feels like it. I have a really good meds so the physical craving is not really a problem, but every time I try quitting I feel like I'm taking away an important part of me. Cigs were there for me for the last 5 years. Every time I was down, every time I felt like the world was falling apart, every time I was on the edge of beating someone up from all the anger and stress. I could always go out and vent it all with a cigarette. I know it's all bullshit and they were never really helping but they were always making it this little bit easier to endure. 

Did you guys have similar experience? How did you convince yourself that you don't need cigs?

1,000 not smoked

I just checked in to my Smoke Free app for the first time in a few days and saw that I'd eclipsed the "1,000 not smoked" milestone. ONE THOUSAND CIGARETTES. In a little over 2 months. What a mortifying thought. For anyone curious, that's a little over 80 hours not smoking. That works out to about one work week per month of my life that I get back from not smoking. That is simply mind-boggling to me. The math on quitting is just awesome!

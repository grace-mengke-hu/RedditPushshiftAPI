Struggling to stop

Hey guys, I have been really struggling to stop smoking recently. The tax prices on cigs has gone up again and they are becoming too expensive for me. I have tried stopping previously but once I have a drink at the pub I crave smoking really badly and always cave in.

My boyfriend has suggested joining him with getting a vape, he has stopped for around a year with this but I don't think it will save me money? I have cut down greatly with smoking but I just can't seem to quit completely. Should I get a vape? 

I have no idea what to try now. I've tried cold turkey and patches and those crappy little e cigs,but nothing has worked. Help??

People who are currently on a non-smoking streak of a week or longer, please answer some questions for me! How is your mental focus (when reading/working on a project)? Energy/motivation levels? Sleep/how easy or hard is it to wake up? How's your general mood? Less or more anxiety/depression?

And any other cool perks you could point out would be greatly appreciated!! I think this will help motivate a lot of people, myself included.

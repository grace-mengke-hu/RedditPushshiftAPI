Never loved the sound of snoring so much

I'm currently sitting in a hospital room, listening to my mother snore.

It is beautiful.

I used to pinch her nose & make her open her mouth if I was snuggling in bed & trying to sleep.

She's been smoking for 40+ years, unrepentant... only down to 3 per day before her open heart surgery yesterday.

I'm so grateful that she caught her symptoms & was able to go to the doctor & avoid a heart attack.

I'm so grateful that she's declared dozens of times in the last 24 hours (during initial recovery from surgery) that she's never smoking again.

I'm so so so grateful for this subreddit, and the support from strangers last year when I decided to quit.

Thank you & good luck on your own journey towards health.

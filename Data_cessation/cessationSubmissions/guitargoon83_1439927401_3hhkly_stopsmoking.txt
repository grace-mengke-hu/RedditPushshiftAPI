One year cig free! A short summary, and a huge eye opener

I actually missed my 1 year anniversary last week. Guess i just don't think about it much anymore! I was a pack-a-day smoker for over 16 years before i decided to quit for good. I did use a vape pen at first, starting off at 12 mg nicotine level and quickly reducing that down to 0mg after a few months. Every once in a while now, i will break out the vape, but i haven't inhaled in probably 4 months or so. It definitely wasn't as hard as i thought it would be. I had amazing support from family, friends, and of course this sub! Being 1 year smoke free couldn't have come at a better time. My mom was just diagnosed with lung cancer last week. She smoked for over 25 years, but shes been smoke free for 20 years. I'm not going to go into details about it, but i don't know what i would do if i still had that nasty habit while she's dealing with this battle. Long story short: Quit now while you're ahead! Thanks for reading.

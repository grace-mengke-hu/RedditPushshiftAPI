I consider this a major victory and I would love to tell you all.

My fiance and I were recently kicked out of his Uncle's house (he brought us here last year to watch his house and dogs while he was gone for ~8 months on business). Well, he came back a couple months ago, and things have been rocky. So after the most recent fight, in which he got horribly violent to the point of threatening us, he kicked us out and gave us a week.

Anyways, within the past few days of crazy planning, having to leave our jobs on such short notice, figure out where we'll live with our cats, and how we'll get there, neither of us picked up a single cigarette. 

I'm super proud of us and I just needed to write out everything in a mini rant.

Thank you for reading, I love you all and your support.

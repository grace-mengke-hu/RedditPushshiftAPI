Quit For Two Weeks, Tested, Passed.

I quit drinking and smoking just over two weeks ago, after a decade of addiction. This is the longest I have gone without doing either since I started smoking, and for me 2 weeks was a huge achievement, if a difficult one. I have been very stressed the last few days, with pressure from both work and home. I have wanted badly to smoke, but I don't want to relapse again, especially having come this far. Cleaning my car just a little while ago, I had the ultimate test. Under my seat was a half pack of cigarettes, with a lighter tucked in the  pack. 

It was just the wrong timing. I was over caffeinated, frustrated, and stressed. I took one out of the pack and put it in my mouth, dry puffed a few times without lighting it. Thought about all the times I'd tried to quit. All the relapses. I thought about how it would taste. 

I thought I could just have one, toss the rest of the pack. I'd still be quit, just a small lapse. ThenI thought about the type of person I wanted to be. I don't want to spend the rest of my life quitting and trying to quit, I want to be a non smoker. The kind of person who doesn't have a second thought about it. 

I took the cancer stick out of my mouth,  put it back in  the pack, crushed it and threw the whole thing in the trash. I never thought I could do that. I've got two weeks, and I'm going to keep going.

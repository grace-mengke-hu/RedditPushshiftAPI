My 3rd Try

Today is my third Day One. I have previously quit for 6 weeks and 9 months. Obviously I fell into the "I can have just one" trap twice now. Third time is the charm, right?  After 26 years of smoking I am so ready and so scared and so worried I won't be able to do it. I have all of my reasons why: Health, family, money. I know I NEED to do this. I can do this. Right. Here I go.

Gotta Quit.

I'm new to this sub, so please be nice.

 My dude told me the other day "you should quit smoking. It's so bad for you and I don't want you to die" we're in an LDR, so the next time I see him probably won't be until March and my ultimate goal is to be smoke free by then!
I've been considering sitting in a sauna, chewing sunflower seeds, really anything to help me quit. I'd love any advice and support anyone can give on this subject!

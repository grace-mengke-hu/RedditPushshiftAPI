50 days in, and another small victory.

I was at work today,  and it was just one of those days. The previous shift had jerked off all night and I'd walked into a shitfight. One guy didn't turn up, and we're already shortstaffed. Roofwork needed supervising and noone told me anyone was coming in. Dumpster was being replaced and the old one was surrounded by shit. Clearly, I must have looked angry and stressed because one of the riggers goes,  "come on brother,  relax,  have a ciggie". He knows I'm off them - in fact,  he makes a point of asking how I'm doing whenever I see him,  which is pretty often. 

"Don't tempt me," I jokingly yell across the venue. 

"No, really," he replies, "I'll give you one if you want one."

"Nah man,  I'm good." And I walk away to deal with the next crisis. 

I guess I should be proud, but I'm actually not. That's just how it is in my head now... I don't even consider saying yes. 

I'm a non-smoker - and I'm definitely proud of that.

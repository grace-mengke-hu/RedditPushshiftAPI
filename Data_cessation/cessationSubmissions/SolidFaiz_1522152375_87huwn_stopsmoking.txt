No cologne allergy

I’ve always liked wearing cologne, but the last 6 to 7 years I always got major headaches whatever scent I used.
I’ve quit smoking for 8 days now and began wearing cologne again on the 3rd day without any issues. 
This to me is a major progress because I finally can continue using my cologne and not carrying “eu de tobacco” scent

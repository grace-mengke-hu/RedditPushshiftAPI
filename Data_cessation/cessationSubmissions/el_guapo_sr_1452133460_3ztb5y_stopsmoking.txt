First time here, 63 hrs in

Hello.  So i've been a smoker for 10 years. and a daily smoker for 9.  I smoked more weed than cigarettes but had a large stint with Ciggs for a a good 5 years.  for the past few years now i've been doing the spliff thing and have gone more and more tobacco heavy.  I've also noticed i've lost a lot of self control and its been an excuse for me to not do what i need to do, not act how I need to act, etc.  So I wanted to take a break from all of it, weed, tobacco, everything and started monday morning.  Well the plan was to start Saturday, but i couldn't, then Sunday, and ultimately i was up till 3 am smoking the last of what I had.  

So i started at 3 am monday morning and now im 63 hrs in, I fiend from time to time but im hoping it all gets better.  Hope im welcome here since its less for cigarettes and more for pot but thanks for being here and thanks for listening

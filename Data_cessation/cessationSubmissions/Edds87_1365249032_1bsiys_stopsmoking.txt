How I quit smoking...

Hey guys. So, this is my 56th day without nicotine. I fell great. Previous times I tried to quit I got sucked back in because of alcohol. There always was a little urge to smoke. Maybe when sober I didn't notice it, but after couple beers it grow exponentially. Now I don't have such problem, even if I'm pissed... Not even a little, I don't miss those moments.       

I was heavy smoker for last 10 years, and I'm 25 now, so do math yourself. I grow up with tobacco, my adult brain formed in high nicotine environment. For last one and a half years I smoked aromatic rolling tobacco which made previous quitting attempts more harder. In last two smoking years I tried to quit smoking like every other month. My non smoking buddies started joking "So you quit not smoking again..." whenever they saw me smoking after failing to quit again and again and again...    
  
What changed? I stumbled upon Allen Carr book. Yeah, there is lot of brainwashing NLP, but it helped me, a lot. Best thing about it is that you can continue to smoke while you read it. But I didn't. I was like day in of not smoking and that was good, because I didn't have to think about when is my last cigarette. I remember my last cigarette. It was shit. I don't miss those times. In February 15th 2014 I'll come back here and write how it fells to don't smoke for a year. Because I know, this time I wont relapse. I smoked my last cigarette in 14th February 2013, I wont step on that rake again.    
  
      

  
**TL;DR-**Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking was very helpful to quit smoking. I don't get any urge to smoke even if I'm drinking booze.

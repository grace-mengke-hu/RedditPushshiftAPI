It's My Ambition

Uh, hello, I'm 17 and have been smoking for 2 years now. Recently I've decided I wanted to join the Canadian Forces and now have it set in my mind that it's what I need in life, so I decided to quit smoking. At first it was simple, just don't smoke, but lately I've been thinking "oh theres no point, the damage has already been done, you can't do it, you're worthless, you'll fail, just smoke and be done with it" and I'm not sure if I can do it, I don't even know why I made this post, I guess I just want to hear what other had to say.

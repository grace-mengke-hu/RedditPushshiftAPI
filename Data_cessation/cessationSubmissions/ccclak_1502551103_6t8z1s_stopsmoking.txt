I'd like to give back

I quit April 1st 2015 and never looked back. I was at this sub a hundred times a day for a while, and now I haven't been here since my 1 year anniversary. I still have my copy of easy way to quit smoking, and I would love to mail it to whoever needs it. 

Thank you all so much, and after this, I think I'm retiring from here officially.


I promise it gets easier

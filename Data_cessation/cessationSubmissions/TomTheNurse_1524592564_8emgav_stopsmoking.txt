I started smoking when I was 14 and I have been smoking for 36 years. After I had a major health scare my wife and I are both trying to quit using the patch. We just made it 24 hours.

A friend of mine suffered a minor stroke.  (He is doing okay and recently went back to work.)  Since we have both been on similar diet, (we both eat like crap), health, (we both smoke and drank heavily for a long time), and fitness, (fitness? LOL!), plans I saw a cardiologist and did a cardiac stress test.  There was an "iffy" area of concern.  The doctor did a cardiac cath.  Not an awful procedure but definitely not fun.  Fortunately it was negative.  He basically told me I have a good chance of not having major cardiac problems anytime soon IF I QUIT SMOKING NOW.  


I stopped drinking a year and a half ago.  The /r/stopdrinking sub really helped me with that.  When I wanted to drink I would scroll through there and know I wasn't alone.  I'm hoping I may have the same experience here. 



I have tried quitting cigarettes in the past but didn't because I honestly did not want to.  So I would bum a smoke here and there, buy a pack and smoke a couple a day, then a few a day, then a half a pack a day then right back where I started.  


It's different this time.  I honestly do want to.  My baby and I pulled the trigger yesterday.  It was torture and we might have said a couple of mean things to each other.  I think a voice got raised slightly.  (LOL!)  We both feel a tiny bit bit less on edge today.  The cravings have also diminished slightly.  

Minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day.

First day almost over, my mind is working against me.

Had my last cigarette 14 hours ago. Going cold turkey. Been thinking about quitting for 6 months or so, and I just decided this morning that today was the day. 

I've gone 2 or 3 days without a cigarette many times (sometimes longer) with no problem. But today it's all I can think about. Instead of just doing everyday things, in my head it's: 
I'm going to drink some juice instead of smoking
I'm going to play games instead of smoking
I'm going to take a bath instead of smoking
I'm going to read about quitting smoking instead of smoking

I think I'll be able to handle the physical withdrawals, but I'm worried about my psychological addiction to smoking. The days I've gone without smoking before were fine, I think because I knew the safety and comfort of a cigarette wasn't that far away. But deciding to be done with them FOREVER  has sent my brain into panic mode.

When does it stop? What can I do to actually take my mind off of smoking?

Tomorrow is my first day as a non-smoker(hopefully)

So tonight I'll be having my last cigarette, and hopefully quit for good. I've been a social smoker during 2012, and became addicted probably by the beginning of 2013.

I tried quitting twice before, and always ended up smoking probably a day or two later, but this time my mind is set on it. I'm quitting with a friend whom I have also convinced to join me on this tough journey. I personally do not enjoy cigarettes, I just smoke because I feel like I am stuck and cannot function without it.

Here's the part that is scaring me the most since I am quitting cold turkey, withdrawal symptoms. I'm assuming many here are facing/faced the same challenge and fear, and would like your advice on how you handled these withdrawal symptoms. 

How did you avoid relapsing? What did you do to put your mind off it? When do these symptoms stop? During situations where you get that urge to smoke, what did you do to not smoke?

Thank you all in advance, and happy new year!

Stop Smoking Check List

Hi there,

I am looking to stop smoking and am making a checklist of things I can do to help me achieve this goal (this is how my mind works!).

So far I have:
- Get a vape
- Create a calendar where each smokeless day I tick
- Subscribe to r/stopsmoking

Do you guys have any recommendations on anything else I can do or guides I can subscribe?

Thanks
Dan

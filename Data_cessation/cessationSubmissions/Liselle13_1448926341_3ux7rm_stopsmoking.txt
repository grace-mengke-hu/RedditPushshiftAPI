Not a good method...but it did work

**TLDR:** faced with a tremendous overwhelming stress, decided I didn't sign up for quitting smoking to be faced with this additional stress.  But for one reason and then another...put off the trip to get smokes.  Kept putting it off until most of the way through work day, and decided I wasn't going to screw up my record at that point.


**Background:** So I expected week 2 to be difficult when I got back to work.  So I had a plan and everything.

Plan fell apart last night.  Found out my husband's depression took a major nosedive again...enormous stress over his mental well being.

So my deal with myself, more than a week ago, was that I would quit and I couldn't even use his binge drinking as a coping mechanism anymore (he struggles with alcoholism).

But a nose-dive in depression?  I wasn't equipped for that.  When I quit smoking, I wasn't expecting to have to face this type of thing.  I was so freaked out, and so fully intended to run out to the gas station on my lunch break to get smokes.

But my two meetings were later in the day then I realized - from 11a-1p.  And then I thought...if I smoke, then it will be easier for him to cave in and smoke...and that's his choice, and I can't control whether he smokes or not, but still...smoking is a major mood changer for him, which is the last thing he needs...

So I ended up just "putting off" the trip out to get smokes.  I put it off all morning.  By the time I got done with my meetings, I decided to put it off again...and eventually it was the end of the day and what's the point of screwing up my record for a smoke that late in the game.

**So I did NOT smoke today.**  Wasn't a great method to get there, but it did the job.  And maybe I can more easily get through tomorrow, knowing I made it through today.  Success creating enough confidence to create more success.

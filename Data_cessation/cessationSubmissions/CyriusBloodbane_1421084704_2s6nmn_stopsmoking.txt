Almost gave in

I almost gave in today. I have been going nearly two weeks without any real issues (after the sleep came back to me of course).

But today I missed a work flight, have to do a bunch of crap to set up a new one, missed a day of the project I was gonna work on, et al. It took every ounce of willpower for me to not go buy a pack, and the craving is not over.

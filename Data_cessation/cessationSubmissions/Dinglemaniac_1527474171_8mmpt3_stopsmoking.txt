6-month milestone today. Thanks to Allen Carr and Tabex.

It's been six months since I've:
- Stood in the cold away from people at parties 
- Dreaded cardio at the end of my workouts
- Avoided standing near people in lifts/work
- Took an hour out of my workday to run down and upstairs.
- Had to check my bank account to see if buying my next packet will be the difference between dinner at home or eating out

Work has gotten a hell of a lot harder and I'm currently going through a rough breakup and I feel no urge to return. It seriously gets easier guys, you just need to make sure you go in with the right mindset :)

Does chewing tobbaco make it easier to quit smoking it?

I have started chewing a bit (in the last hour) to try and wean myself off the cigs. I plan on doing this for the next (roughly) three days, until I've gone through the worts of the withdrawals. Thoughts? I know it seems contradictory, but the nicorette gum isn't working much- and I honestly don't think myself ending up addicted to the chewing, as I consider it highly disgusting, worse than cigs.

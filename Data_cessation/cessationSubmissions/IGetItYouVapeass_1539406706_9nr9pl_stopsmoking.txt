I need help

As I'm sitting here typing this I have a cigarette in my hand. Its a need that I feel while I'm driving,sitting and just doing anything with a pause. Ive been in a relationship for six years this October 1st and I need to quit. I'm so depressed that I will never marry my S.O.  He said if I quit for 30 days he will marry me.  I really need some positive support on this. All I want to do is just cry and get pregnant. I had an abortion because he's a couple years younger than me, were both above 25, and he has never let me live it down. I never wanted him to feel trapped like his sister did with her baby daddy when she was younger. I just want out of this. Yes it brings me temporary comfort but I dont want to lose this man. He might be an alright dude but he smokes weed like a fucking chimney and sells it too. I just need some positive stuff, I'm on my last pack and any advice would be appreciated. I'm broken down and just depressed that I'm just tainted.

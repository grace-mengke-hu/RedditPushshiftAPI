What's the most drastic thing you have done in order to quit smoking?

I've been a smoker for nearly five years now, and while I feel physically ready to quit (sick of being out of breath, etc.), I'm not sure I have the willpower in my current situation to go through with it. It's far too easy to buy a pack and justify quitting next week. I know I need to have the right mindset and I've been brainstorming ideas that might help me get into the mindset. 

I'm really into the idea of using my vacation (about a month) to do something drastic, like an extended Appalachian trail hike where it'll be much harder to both smoke and succeed in and enjoy the experience.

I'd love to hear from some people that have successfully stopped smoking by doing something drastic, and also from anyone else who might think this is a foolish idea. 

Is an ironclad will and laser mental focus too necessary for the cessation process, or can I count on forcing myself to quit by doing something like this?

2 years!

I deleted my old account but came back to get my badge yesterday on the day of my 2 year anniversary.

To all new quitters: YOU HAVE THIS! 

I was a pack a day smoker for 11 years. I quit at 31. I feel healed though I know my body is still working on healing. I have run 3 marathons, 3 half marathons and a few 10ks since quitting. Life is good.

Second Time Around

Ok, this time I'm using both positive and negative reinforcement. I have two jars. I've figured out how much each cigarette costs. Starting tomorrow, for each cigarette I smoke, I have to put the cost of that cigarette in the "smoking" jar. For each one I don't smoke (5-#smoked), I put the cost of a cigarette in the "me" jar. At the end of each month, I will donate the "smoking" jar to a cause I 100% oppose and I get to use the "me" jar for whatever I want (savings, a movie, a nice meal, etc.). My friend has decided to match my "smoking" jar, so each cigarette is double the amount of support for something I don't support. As an activist, I feel this will be more successful than just quitting. I plan on carrying materials for the cause I dislike to help motivate me to quit. I don't want to give them money.

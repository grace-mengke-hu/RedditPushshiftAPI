Starting over again. Scared of failing again.

I noticed last night that my occasional cigarettes were getting closer together, and there was more and more of a desire to have them.  I thought maybe it could be like how I used to drink a lot when I was younger and now I only drink once in a great while and I usually don't even finish it.  I was wrong.  I have an eye exam coming up because I am diabetic and I am worried about the damage both my blood sugar and the cigarettes may have caused my eyes.  I think my husband has a thing for someone he works with.  We're short a ton of people at work and I'm working six days weeks.  I don't know how I am going to get through it.  I was so far into it when I fell.  I feel like I'm never going to be free.

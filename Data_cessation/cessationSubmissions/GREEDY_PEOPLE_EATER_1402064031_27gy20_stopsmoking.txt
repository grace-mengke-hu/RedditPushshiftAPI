How long after one quits smoking can you start doing intense cardio workouts again?

The reason I ask, is it seems like all the gunk in your lungs would be shoved further in or you would be pushing seriously weakened lungs (and heart) too hard too soon. On the other hand, maybe it opens up your lungs to help push all the gunk out.

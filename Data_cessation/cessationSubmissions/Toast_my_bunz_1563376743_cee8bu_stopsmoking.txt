Two years ago I didn't think I would ever quit smoking for good. Today marks 436 days smoke free.


My girlfriend and I decided to quit in may of last year. We both had quit before for a few months or weeks at a time but always gone back. At the time I was smoking a pack a day, and sometimes more when I would go out to bars with my friends, or when i would take vyvanse and study for long periods of time. I could tell that my health was bad, and getting worse. One day I realized that if I dont take care of myself, I wouldn't get to see my future family grow up and experience their lives. So we decided then and there to quit. I just wanna say that, even though it is not easy, it is doable and I believe you can do it. Your personal reason may be different than mine but take that and use it every day to strengthen yourself. The first month is as bad as everyone says it is, but it gets easier and the cravings become easier to control. Get someone to hold you accountable and be honest with them and yourself. No one is perfect and mistakes happen but as long as you are moving toward your goal if quitting, you are making progress. Keep your head up. Thanks for letting me rant.

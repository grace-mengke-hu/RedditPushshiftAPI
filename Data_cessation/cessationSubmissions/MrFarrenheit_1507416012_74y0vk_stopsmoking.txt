1st week in 10 years without a cig! :)

Thought I'd share! My mouth feels brand new - can't believe I'd come to accept the dry, bland taste of tobacco as the normal taste of life. Breathing feels easier and fresher - my run the other day was easier (hope it wasn't just all in my mind). Most importantly - I feel in control! 

Tried to quit a few times before with vapes, but ended up just smoking inside more and wanting the real thing. This time I'm just using nicotine lozenges, and avoiding too much alcohol (which kills my self-control). Finding the lozenges much more helpful, since it's just like having a mint and allows me to put the cigs out of my mind! Each day taking fewer,  and the cravings coming fewer and further between. Easy to spot when I used to smoke just out of habit (e.g. just leaving the house) and when I actually have a cravings. Then I know when I have to fight the cravings, and where I can reduce the nicotine!

Good luck to everyone else!

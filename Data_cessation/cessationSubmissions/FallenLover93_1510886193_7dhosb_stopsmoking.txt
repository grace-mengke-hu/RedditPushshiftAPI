Second time quitting, 14 days non smoking so far

I’ve been an on and off smoker and this is my 2nd big quit, I stopped cold turkey because I found out I’m pregnant but since I stopped I’ve had an awful cough to the point I bring up blood,  and I constantly feel like I’m wheezing all the time or hard to catch a deep breathe, anyone experience this before?
I’ve been to the hospital, they said my lungs are good but nothing else.  I can’t sleep or function :(

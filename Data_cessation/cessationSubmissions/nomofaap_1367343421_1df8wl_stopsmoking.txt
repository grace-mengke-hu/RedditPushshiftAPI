I smoked my last tobacco last night.

I recently started nofap, last week and decided to take it a step further and stop tobacco also. I would not say I was addicted but I think I liked smoking and nicotine more than I should. I figure I will approach it with the same attitude as nofap and emerge a better person. :-)

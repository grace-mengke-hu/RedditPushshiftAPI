300! I am 65 days away from a smiley face!

I can't believe I have made it this long. I will never use again, and I couldn't be happier. In the last 300 days I have passed a bar exam, lost 25 lbs, gotten engaged, admitted I am an alcoholic and stopped drinking, and have generally been a much happier person.

Anyone just starting out... keep it up! It will be the best decision you make.

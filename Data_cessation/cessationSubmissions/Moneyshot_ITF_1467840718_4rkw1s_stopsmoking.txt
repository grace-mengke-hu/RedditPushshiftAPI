Hello people of Reddit with Emphysema or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). I am writing a paper and would like to interview persons with either condition. Here are the questions:

1) Have you noticed any change in your mood or feelings? Good or bad?

2) Have your feelings about your appearance changed in the time you have been dealing with the condition?

3) Has the condition affected your ability to live a life that you are accustomed to live? Ability to work? Any change in your interest or hobbies?

4) Has the condition caused any changes in your family or friend relationships?

5) What is a normal day like for you? Start with your morning routine.
Thank you all!

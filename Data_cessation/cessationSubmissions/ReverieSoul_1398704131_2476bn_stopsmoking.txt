Today is the day I quit and...

I'm not sure how I'm going to handle this. I'm quitting because I can't afford it anymore. I feel like I'm going to break psychologically, and I'm not sure what aid to use to help me quit (patch, gum, spray, inhaler). I've been smoking almost 10 years, help or advice would be nice.

I really don't want to lose my sanity.

3 years 7 months and 11 days cigarette free....

...but, I'm going to Vegas at the end of August and I would *really* like to have a cigar.  I know there's nicotine and that you don't really inhale cigar smoke, but I still think it would be "cheating".  I can handle the cigarette smoking going on around me, but I feel like I might give in and just have a cigar...I think what I'm looking for is to have someone tell me that it's still "smoking" and not to ruin the last three years by giving in and having a cigar even though it's "just a cigar".  Just feeling a little weak willed atm.

Question about patch

This is the first time I've tried to quit smoking. I'm using patch (Nicoderm) and it recommends using the 21mg/day patch for six weeks before switching down. I want to do it sooner, but I'm worried that I'm being to hasty. For context I was smoking a little less than a pack a day. If anyone has experience I'd love to hear your thoughts, and good luck quitting!

Trying My Best

Hello Quitters,

       Hope all is well. I am a 29 year old female. I started smoking when I was 19 after my father passed. It was really hard on me. I lost my scholarship and quit school. Someone told me cigarettes helps your problems go away. YEAH RIGHT!!! So here I am 10 years later. I have tried quitting on several occasions. I am two weeks "kinda" smoke free. I used patches for my first three days. And in the last 11 days, I've had only 2 cigarettes. I used to smoke a pack a day. I have to say I am MIGHTY proud of myself. This is my furthest Ive been in any of my smoking journeys. But my girl makes me feel so bad for picking up a cigarette again. Those two I gave into she made it seem like I robbed and killex someone. We quit smoking at the same time but she smoked maybe a half pack a day for bout 4 years. I just want to know its ok and its not the end of the world because I have dabbed here and there. Thanks in advance.

Is the beginning the hardest part? If so, when does it get easier?

I'm six days in. On the Patch, and a Vaporizer. I don't know if that counts as quitting to you guys, I'm consuming tons of nicotine. But it's still hard. Not getting any easier yet, yesterday was the worst day. Just curious how long it takes to start getting easier or if maybe the hardest part is yet to come?

Another question:

I'm having cravings but they are probably being helped by the Patch and Vaping. The hardest thing for me is just the habit. Driving, sitting at my computer, so many things my mind associates with lighting up. Anybody have any tips for dealing with that? How to break that mental habit?

Thanks.

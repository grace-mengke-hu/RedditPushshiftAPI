What's the deal with shisha?

I have quit smoking 3 years ago and never, ever looked back. I have not smoked or even taken a single puff at a cigarette in 3 years. However, I occasionally smoke shisha. Here is the thing: I know from my previous failed attempts that even a single puff puts you bak to smoking full time, so I steered veeery clear of any nicotine product. But then I tried shisha (I didn't know it had actual tobacco in it) and everything was fine. It didn't put me back to smoking, and I only use it once every few months with complete control (very much unlike cigarettes). So my question is this: does shisha really contain tobacco? And if it does, why doesn't it put me back to smoking? It doesn't even make me crave cigarettes. DAE have the same experience?

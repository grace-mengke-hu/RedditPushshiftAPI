Having a hard time running. Any tips?

So I quit 11 days ago (yay!) and I've been doing really well. Hardly any cravings. I can eat and drink as I please and not want to smoke. I'm 23 now (almost 24) and have been smoking since I was 14. I also happened to start playing varsity sports at 14. Since then I have been running fairly regularly. However, once I stopped smoking, I found it really hard to breathe. I don't enjoy running. It hurts! Are there any other former smoker runners that might be able to help a sista out? Ps I have an actual 10k coming up in April and suddenly I'm scared I can't do it.

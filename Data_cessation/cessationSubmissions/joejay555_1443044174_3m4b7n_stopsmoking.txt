going on chantix again !!!

hi guys, I quit smoking using chantix about 8 months ago and was smoke free for 4 months and was working well , then i wound up picking it up in vegas this summer , i fooled myself in thinking that if i didnt inhale i wouldnt get hooked again , obviously iam back to a full pack again . 

yesterday was my first day on chantix and already feeling crappy , it was really miserable last time i quit smoking via chantix so i'm hoping i can make it through again .  Have a girlfriend so i hope it doesnt affect our relationship too much but i get a bad feeling

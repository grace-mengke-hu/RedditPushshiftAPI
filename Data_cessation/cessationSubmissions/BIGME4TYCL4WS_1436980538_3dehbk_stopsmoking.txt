My logic is so backwards but it's working and I don't care.

I tried quitting before and hust could never bring myself to do it. Just a mindset thing I guess. Anyway, i was in walgreens two days ago and I've always been and impulse buy kind of dude so I picked up some of the nicotine gum. Went home and finished the end of my last pack and started chewing. 

Well not gunna lie I've been craving a cigarette wicked bad the past two days, but looking at that 50 dollar box of gum is keeping me from going to the store. Then I think of all the money this 50 bucks could actually save me in the long run. Anway I'm rambling. anyone else feel kinda spacey/hazy the first few days?

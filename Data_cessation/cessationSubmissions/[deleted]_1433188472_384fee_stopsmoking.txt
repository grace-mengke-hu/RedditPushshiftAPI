It's been roughly 8 hours since I smoked the last cigarette in my pack

I decided that after that last cigarette was gone, I wouldn't buy another pack. I'm fiending incredibly hard for a smoke right now, and don't know how to convince myself not to go buy a pack this instant. 

Ughhhhh this almost impossible.

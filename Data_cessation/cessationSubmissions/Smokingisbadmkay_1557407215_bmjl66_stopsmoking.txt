I can breathe! Mentally and Physically!

I turn 32 in a couple of months. I have been a regular smoker since I was 17. I was a pretty heavy smoker until I was about 24 and cut it back but I was still smoking. Then it got to the point that everyone around me thought I quit but I was literally finding ways to hide it. 

I had been a closet smoker for YEARS. Finding places to hide my cigarettes and lighters, finding places to smoke where no one would see me. I’d wear a pullover I kept hidden deep in the Burroughs of my car. I found every way to hide it. 

Then it hit me and I told myself how much of a liar and phony I was. How I was cheating my family and friends out of a good life with me because I was hiding this awful habit, physically and financially. You can hide smoking but you can’t hide cancer or heart disease. I also want to be able to have as much time with my family as possible. I kept telling myself, “okay this is it, one more cigarette.” And then eventually I thought, wouldn’t it suck to be on your deathbed, early even, and wishing for one more day because you just had to have one more cigarette?

It’s been two weeks. And I ain’t going back. Like, the thought of them is disgusting. Cold turkey is the best way. Just do it.

Stopping Patch Early

I've been quitting using the patch and am 3 weeks smoke free. The patch's box recommends using a high dosage patch (21mg) for the first four weeks, 14 mg for the next 2 weeks, and 7 mg for the final 2 weeks. My last high dosage patch will be this coming Monday.

However, in the time since I've started the patch, I read the Allen Carr book and my thinking on it has shifted. Now I am leaning towards just stopping the patch and not continuing to the lower doses. On the other hand, I do see some merit in the weening process.

Any thoughts/recommendations? I understand there's probably a different "right" answer for everyone; just looking for some opinions.

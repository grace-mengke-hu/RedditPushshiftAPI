Went for a drink, didn't relapse

Yesterday I went out for drinks with smoker friends. I knew it would be hard but I wanted to tempt the devil.    
So beforehand I had a little talk with myself saying "Look at your future, do you picture yourself as a smoker in a year? No. So tonight is a step toward this goal. You won't happen to be a non smoker in a year just like that. So don't smoke tonight, even if it's really hard. It will get easier but you will have to overcome hard times and you will feel stronger. Be your own hero and beat this addiction."    
I also pictured being at the bar with my friends and not smoking.    
It wasn't easy, but to overcome the cravings I remembered the talk I had with myself and imagined how proud I would be the next day.    
I did not relapse, and boy, I am proud of myself

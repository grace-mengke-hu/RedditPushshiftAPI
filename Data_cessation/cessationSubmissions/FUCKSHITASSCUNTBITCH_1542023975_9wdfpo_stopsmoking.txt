Anyone tried nicotine in water/coke where vaping isn't allowed.

I've worked for a while in a shop where vaping at my machine was allowed. Starting a new job tomorrow where it is not. I've read that nicotine absorption in the stomach is pretty efficient and was wondering if anyone has ever tried taking vape juice and either just putting a drop on their tongue now and then, or adding a few ml of it to their drinks has been effective at curbing nicotine cravings over a long shift.

I vape 20-21mg/ml, and usually vape 4-5ml a day. I figured if I put 1-2 ml in each large cup of water or coke I drink, at levels that would be equal to or less what I would be vaping, shouldn't do any harm as long as I'm not doing it on an empty stomach. But I wanted to check and see if anyone has tried it first, to get some feedback and advice.

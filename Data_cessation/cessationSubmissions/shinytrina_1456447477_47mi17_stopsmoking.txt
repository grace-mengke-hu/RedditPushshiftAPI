WTF cravings

So I was doing well until I was drying up my dishes and all of a sudden I was over come with a very strong craving.  I had to stop what I was doing and drink some water and close my eyes and take some deep breaths to get rid of it.  I fucking hate this. :(  Why the fuck did I ever start in the beginning?

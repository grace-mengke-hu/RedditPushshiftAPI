For those without patches/tablets-How are you coping with carvings?

Its been a week since i stopped cold turkey, after 17 years of smoking. Its pretty tough, but every day I am more proud and determined to make it work, otherwise i would feel like a total failure to smoke another one after all this struggle. 
I need to know what do you do when a craving struck? I feel dizzy/mad/hungry/sad/mad all at once for 10, 15 minutes and i feel like i can sleep all day. 
I usually walk a dog, play a game or eat like a pig. I need to stop eating.  

What about you?

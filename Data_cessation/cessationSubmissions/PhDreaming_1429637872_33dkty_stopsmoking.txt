Ugh.

Everything is pissing me off today... the project I've been working on for weeks is making very little progress and I'm tired of dealing with it.  The person who is supposed to be helping me is driving me crazy, since she is really just slowing down the entire process.  Seriously, she's not a stupid person but she's made so many errors I almost think she's intentionally screwing up.  And to make matters worse, my stupid brain keeps saying that while having a smoke wouldn't make the problems go away, it would make me feel better, even though I *KNOW* that's not the case.  I guess I'm just a little disappointed in myself, since I'm usually better at coping with stress and I had thought I was past the super wanna-punch-someone-in-the-face cravings by now.  OK, rant over, thanks for reading.  I hope your day is going much better than mine!

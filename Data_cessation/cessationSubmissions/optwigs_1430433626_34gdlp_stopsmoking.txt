I really want to stop, new here, any advice?

I made a reddit account after lurking for about a year because I love that star thing everyone has with the days since quitting, and I really need something like that to encourage me. Read alot of the posts and love how supportive everyone is. I'm in college and everyone here is smoking so much I just get tempted so much.

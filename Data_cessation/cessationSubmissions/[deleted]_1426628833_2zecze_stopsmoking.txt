72 hours in. I am willpower absolute. I Keep saying that to myself.

Everyone has their motivation for quitting smoking. 

Whether that be for personal health reasons, a loved one or friend suffering from health implications due to smoking, money, the strain it puts on your relationships, or simply to prove to oneself you still have absolute willpower over your own actions.

I do it for all of these. Six and a half years of smoking starting when I was just nineteen years old. 

No. I'm sorry, but, no more. There is unequivocally, absolutely, NO WAY I am losing this battle. This is the first time I've even attempted to quit. There won't be a second. 

I am stronger than a fucking inanimate object. My willpower is undying and absolute. You have my word.

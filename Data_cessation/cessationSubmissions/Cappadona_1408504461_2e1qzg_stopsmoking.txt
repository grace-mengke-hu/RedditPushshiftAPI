My second had smoking affecting others

I have not quit smoking yet but am in the process of planning after several failed attempts (always relapse when drinking).

Today while smoking in the garage which is below my mates's bedroom, I heard her coughing. Can the secondhand smoke penetrate the drywall and floorboard and into her room? It was just a first time revelation that my smoking affects other than myself and really motivated me to quit.

challenge complete

I randomly decided to not smoke two weeks ago and have kept it up all this time. Usually I'd quit smoking and vape or something like that but I decided cold turkey, no nic was the way to go. I feel wonderful in so many ways.

Anyway, my big victory was last night. I am a musician and play a lot of late night shows. A gig day is just a giant trigger of smoking for me, as there's a lot of waiting around, setting up, and then playing and drinking on top of that (at least at this venue in our home town).  I hardly had time to think about smoking, let alone crave one all night! Usually I'd be literally fighting my way through the bar past the massive crowd of people to get in a puff, but not last night.

That just feels really good to say. I don't feel like death today, which the day after a show I usually do. All around proud of myself. Thanks for the support here in this sub, and good luck to all the other quitters out there!

TL;DR: made it through a show without smoking, challenge complete.

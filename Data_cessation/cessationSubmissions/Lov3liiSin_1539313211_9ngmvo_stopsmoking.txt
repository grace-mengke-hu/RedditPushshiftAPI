Restlessness ðŸ¤ª

I've noticed that my sleeping pattern's off. On top of that  I'm finding it hard to get good sleep. Continuously waking up every 40 to 45 mins, for no reason at all. Not having bad dreams, or finding it hard to go back. Just staying sleep is my issue at the moment. Which leads me to be tired as fuck at times. What can I do?

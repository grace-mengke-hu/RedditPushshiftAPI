Social smoking?

It's weird. I quit, without a smoke for approx 2 months. Then, I caved. And the next morning? I felt just fine and had no desire to smoke. It's happened a few times since, and still, I have no desire to actually go out and buy smokes, but if a friend offers me one with a beer? Cool.

Like, I'm kind of surprised that I'm fine with this. It's almost as if my desire to not smoke day to day and quit is letting me be a social smoker?

In the past, if I had more than one, boom, full on smoking. Any attempts at being social failed. This time is different and I don't get it.

One last step

My mental health was poor and drugs, alcohol and cigarettes kept me going.

Since I started therapy a few weeks back, got new medication and started to make changes for myself and others I feel the need to finally sort out the smoking habit once and for all.

How can I enjoy quitting booze while my health is still getting worse each day? How can I enjoy better spending habits when I spend over 100 bucks a month on cigarettes? 

I smoke more cigarettes daily then I can count and the old charme of having a coffee with a cigarette in the morning is long replaced by constant cravings.

I don't think quitting will come easy for me, but do think it's the right moment in my life.

Any advice for my journey is appreciated and I hope sharing this loose collection of my thoughts  will help me on day one tomorrow morning.

Cravings can happen even 62 days in

Guys. I had some usual and strong cravings over the last two days after not having any virtually since like day 6 after quitting. I didn't cave (even though my roommate and I quit around the same time but he's since relapsed). 

Stay vigilant friends. Cravings can come whenever the hell they please. Remember why you've quit and remind yourself. Stay strong and quitting is easy.

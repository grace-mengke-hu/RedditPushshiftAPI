Anyone else feel tired day 1 of quitting?

I started smoking in August with the intention to quit vaping, thinking it'd be easier to quit (technically is, but still tough). Today is my quit day after 4 months of smoking. 
While surprisingly, the cravings haven't been all that bad. 
But man, am I tired. 
I'm not at all hungover (had 2 beers last night for new years) and more than enough sleep.
But I feel like I just worked a load of manual labor. I'm struggling to stay awake. 
Am I alone in this?

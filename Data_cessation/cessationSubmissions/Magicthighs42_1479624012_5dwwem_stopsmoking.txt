Easier every time I quit. Don't give up.

It's my 2nd time quitting this year (4th in two years) each time gets longer and longer. Each time has less extreme withdrawal symptoms. I've had about 3 very minor cravings my first day (astounding compared to previous where I thought I was physically going to kill someone or myself). 


I've learned how to quit : high level of distraction, no social or physical demands for the first day - 4 days. I do it during my vacations and make sure that I don't have to leave the house because driving is a huge trigger. Lots of water and brushing teeth when oral fixation. Most important; just breathe. Seriously 2-5 minutes of breathing deeply and slowly. 

I know I can do it: I used to panic because it was the end of something that I felt like I loved.  This shows you how abusive the nicotine relationship is. I've  come to the conclusion that saying "never again" make quitting more difficult. Trick is: don't panic and keep your anxiety down. 

Please keep trying. Be verbally proud and keep your non-smoking support group updated. Don't be ashamed to tell people that you're quitting again, or that you failed. Get back on the wagon. Its easier every time. 

Good luck. You deserve to life a longer better life.

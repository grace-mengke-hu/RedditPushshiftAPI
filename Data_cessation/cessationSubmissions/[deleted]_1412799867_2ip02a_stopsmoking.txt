From 240 to 0?

So today was a pretty tough day to me. I usually never have cravings, I feel great about not smoking, but today my relationship ended and I went to drink some wine with a friend of mine and I ended up smoking two cigarettes, just to do something stupid..I'm not sure if this means I'll go back to zero or whatever happens next..Has anyone of you guys been in a similar situation? What did you do? Any hint is appreciated.

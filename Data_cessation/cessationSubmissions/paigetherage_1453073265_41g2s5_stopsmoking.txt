Survived a five-hour drive!

I used to think that driving on the highway, listening to music, and smoking cigarettes was one of life's greatest pleasures. I was really worried about the five-hour drive I had to make yesterday. It was tough, but I listened to loud music, enjoyed the scenery, and realized that I didn't have to worry about letting the cold air into the car, ashes flying everywhere, burning holes in my seats, littering the beautiful landscape with nasty cigarette butts, etc. This was the hardest time I've had in the 16 days I've been quit, but I learned that even my strongest triggers can be dealt with. I hope everyone is doing well and having a great weekend.

I relapsed last night; I've reset and I am back with a passion!

Upon my relapse last night, I began to feel a rage of passion flowing through my veins, not just for quitting cigarettes, but life in totality. I'm here to succeed and kick life in the ass. I have been very lethargic and unmotivated recently, but this new me against the world mentality is feeling damn good. Fuck cigarettes, lets do this.

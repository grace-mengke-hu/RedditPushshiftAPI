26 hours and counting!

My last cigarette was at 8am on the 10th October 2016 (Sydney time). I've tried multiple times to quit over the last few months and I failed every time. Fianc√© (34M - nonsmoker) and I (29F) have decided to try for a baby and I definitely want to be smoke-free when we finally do conceive.

It's been the most difficult 26 hours **EVER** and every few hours I get the urge to run out and buy a pack. I've managed to talk myself out of it each time and remind myself why I'm quitting but DAMN those cravings... it's hard!

On the bright side though, I *AM* enjoying the fact that I still smell like the perfume I put on this morning rather than reeking of cigarettes :-)

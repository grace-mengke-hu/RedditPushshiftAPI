Today my smoke free app told me I had made it 240 hours smoke free. I haven't been this proud of something in a long time.

At the same time though, it's been so easy thanks to The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. Today when I looked at the app I saw that in 10 days I had only logged 6 cravings, and even those i mainly logged just to do it. It's not that those cravings weren't rough (and I probably had a few more than 6), it's that I knew that there's no way a craving would make me cave. I was a good portion through the Easy Way when I realized I was ready, and I finished my pack at a bar with my friends and decided it was my last. As soon as I knew it was my last it was easy. And I honestly felt so good just *the first morning* after quitting that I knew I never wanted another cigarette. 

Hopefully I'm not coming off as overzealous. I know I've only made it 10 days üòù but these 10 days have been so easy that I really don't have much if any fear about whether or not I can do it, or whether or not I've done it.

Because I know and love that I have!

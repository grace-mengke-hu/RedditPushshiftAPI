Attempt 5

I'm 14 hours in to attempt #5 to quit, and I feel better about this one than ever before.  

My longest period ive gone without smoking was about 9 months, but i was still a social smoker and id smoke with friends while drinking.   It got so bad i was buying my friends packs of cigarettes so i could still lie to myself that I'd quit and smoke their cigarettes.


This time i will not lie to myself.   I want to quit for my health (high blood pressure) and for my children.

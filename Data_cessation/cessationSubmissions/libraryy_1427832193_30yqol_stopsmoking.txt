Tips for drinking?

I guess the title says it-- i smoke when I drink. It's a social thing and it's also an opportunity for me to be alone when there are throngs of people about. What do you do? I've been good, gone two drinking occasions without smoking which is a fuckin record for me but I'm almost dreading the next time I drink more than 3 beers. 

Thoughts? Thanks

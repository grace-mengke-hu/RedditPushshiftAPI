Milestone: 1 month

After countless attempts, I tried to quit again on April 12 at 1 pm. And for some reason, I am successful this time. Today, marks 1 month of me staying smoke free. I dont feel cravings anymore, and even If I think about a cigarette, the feeling lasts less than 10 seconds. Of course, i never drank all this time. So, that is something I should be on watch for, before I can feel confident.

For all those who recently quit, or thinking about quitting after countless attempts like me, the only thing that you have to do is to stay smoke free for 1 day. And stick with it. Keep counting hours, I think that helps. I set up a countdown timer on timeanddate.com to see when I last smoked, and seeing every day pass by helps with confidence. Far too early for me to give advise to anyone, but this is what has helped me kick the habit.

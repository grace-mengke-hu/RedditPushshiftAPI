Dad picked up smoking again 2 months after a 4 month cold turkey (25years smoking)

Hi fellow redditors,

I thought i would stop by and ask for some guidance on the reconciliations of my thoughts on how to help/speak to my dad about the unfortunate situation that he has recently put himself into. Little back story... 

M*y dad has been smoking for 25 years until he had a heart attack and had to get stents put in due to a 85\% blockage in one of his ventricles. He then quit smoking and went 4 months without it until he started to smoke behind the families back for 2 months. I'm not sure how much he has smoked in the last 2 months as he hasn't been entirely honest and his low in trait openness which certainly doesn't help*

After me and my family found out again, it has placed more stress on us and was wondering if you guys and/or gals could shine some light as to how to proceed with assisting him to quit? Many thanks!

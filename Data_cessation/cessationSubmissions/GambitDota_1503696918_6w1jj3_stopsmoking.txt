Does the amount you spoke per day have any influence on how hard it'll be to quit?

Most smokers I know smoke a pack a day. For me packs usually last around 3-4 days. Does that mean it'll be any easier for me to quit than the average person? At least a noticeable amount?


edit: damn typo.. I'm asking about how much you smoke, not how much you speak! Unless that also influences withdrawal...

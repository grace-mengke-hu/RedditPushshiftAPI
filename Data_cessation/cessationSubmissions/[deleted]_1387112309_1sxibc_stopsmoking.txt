Apps for quitting smoking.

Sorry is this has been asked before but can anyone recommend a good app for quitting smoking, I have used cessation nation in the past which focuses on the time and financial aspects of quitting but I have seen screenshots of one that shows the health benefits over time. Does anyone know the name of it?

Thank you.

Bumpy road.

Hey guys! I need some advice.

I lived the past year abroad, and, since I came back to my country early this year, I quit smoking. I thought it was once and for all. I wasn't smoking even in parties where heavy drinking was involved. Well, apparently it's not the case. I started smoking again when out drinking. I really can't wrap my mind around it. I am still exercising and feeling pretty good overall, but can't resist a cigarette when drinking a beer with my friends. It's seems as if I lost some of the impulse I got from coming back home, when everything felt fresh. I need advice about how feel this way again, how to feel motivated, and not start falling in the same traps once more.

Thanks in advance!

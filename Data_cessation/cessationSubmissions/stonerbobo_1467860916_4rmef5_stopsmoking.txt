Quitting while job hunting?

So I've been thinking about quitting (tried cold turkey 10 days ago.. gave up after 1 day), but I'm currently job hunting and need to find something ASAP because of visa issues. Will have many interviews over the next few weeks, and a lot of studying and prep to do.

Based on your experience, do you think its a good idea to quit during this time? I'm worried it will affect my concentration, anxiety etc. and i need to be in top shape right now.

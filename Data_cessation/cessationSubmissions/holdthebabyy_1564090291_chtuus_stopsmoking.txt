1 month and 16 days in, and I could cave in at any moment!

The cravings have definitely become weaker but they’re still regular. I was originally using nrt patches and then a mouth spray, which I stopped just 2 days ago.

I had a bizarre moment today where I’d just finished a task at work and I went to stand up to go outside for a cigarette. For less than a second I’d forgotten I no longer smoke.

I’m still have an idea in my mind that maybe I will smoke again in the future, just a few here and there at a party or something... but then I have to remind myself of how shitty smoking really is and how dangerous it is for my health.

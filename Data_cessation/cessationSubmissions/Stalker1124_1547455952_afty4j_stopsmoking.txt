Just my 2nd day. Need help.

Okay so I've been trying to quit for a long time but never seem to be successful. In fact i cannot even go a day without smoking. I've tried quitting in the past and 24-30 hrs seemed to be the peak time i could control myself. I did once quit for 30 straight days 9 months back but then one day decided to have a smoke while i was out with my friends thinking that a few smokes after such a long period won't make me an addict again. Sadly I relapsed and till today had been smoking at least 8-10 cigs a day. This is just my second day of quitting i already feel so restless. I feel angry and depressed at the same time thinking that without smoking my life means nothing. 

I would really appreciate if someone could give me some tips on how to keep myself going on the path of a smoke free life.

Day three, cold turkey. Feeling and acting pretty spastic.... I just need some cheering on. Nobody knows I'm quitting.

Today is my third day of no cigarettes after six months of smoking around a half a pack a day. This six months was my third relapse, and hopefully my last.

I'm feeling especially frantic and spazzy today. It might have something to do with the fact that I've been consuming more caffeine in place of smoking... I dunno.

But I'm coming up with all kinds of reasons to go buy a pack of cigarettes. I seem to have been using them as some kind of "fuck you" to everyone. Silly. Still though, I'm getting all kinds of internal messages saying that I should just go buy a pack. Lots of rationalizing. Lots of irrationalizing. 

I like to create problems for myself. If I don't have some kind of problem to work against, I feel unsafe or something. I flail around. So, if I quit smoking, I have one less problem to occupy myself with, and that feels dangerous to me. It's weird. It's how I am I guess. But I'm not going to go buy a pack of cigarettes.............. I think. Hopefully. 

Fuck!

Exercise is actually fun

In 3 days I'll have been quit (cold turkey) for 5 months. When I smoked, exercising was terrible. I could barely make it through one workout without feeling like I was dying, so my attempts at going to the gym and getting in shape were complete fails. I couldn't understand how people actually enjoyed working out and could go to the gym multiple times a week. Weren't they constantly miserable? When I quit smoking, I told myself I wouldn't stress about any added weight I would inevitably put on, and that I'd first get comfortable not smoking before trying to lose the extra. So after I was sure that my quit attempt was going to stick, I joined a gym. I normally go four times a week.  


Yesterday, we spent a little over an hour at the gym for cardio/back/core. Then I spent the whole afternoon rock climbing with friends. This morning, I woke up at 5:30 am to go to my 6am strength class. And that's become a normal routine for me.

Exercising is fun now. When I do a really difficult workout, I feel GOOD afterwards instead of not being able to breathe. I've turned into a person that looks forward to going to the gym. The reason I wrote this post is to say that quitting smoking has completely changed my life for the better. The 2 hours I get back each day from not smoking has allowed me to pursue new things, and when I'm with friends, I don't have to leave or stop what we're doing for 7-9 minutes. And this is just the first 5 months... I have my whole life to look forward to. YOU can quit too!

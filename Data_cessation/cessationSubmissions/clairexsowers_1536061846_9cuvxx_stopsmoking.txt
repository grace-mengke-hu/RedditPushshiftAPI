19 days

I quit smoking 19 days ago. Last time I went a year and a half. The goal is to never pick up again this time. I don't want my kids to smoke and I don't want to be a "do as I say not as I do " parent. So far so good. Wish me luck ðŸ‘Œ and good luck to anyone out there starting the journey for the first time.

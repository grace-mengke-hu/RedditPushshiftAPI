Weird cough gone

I smoked for two years. About six months in, I developed this weird cough and a feeling like I needed to clear my throat that never went away. So I'd clear my throat at least twice a minute, every minute of every day. After a while some of my friends and my boyfriend started making fun of me for it. I always felt like complete shit for this. It always made me question why I still smoke although not enough to make me quit. I am a couple of days away from three months smoke free and am happy to report that all these respiratory symptoms have cleared completely :-)

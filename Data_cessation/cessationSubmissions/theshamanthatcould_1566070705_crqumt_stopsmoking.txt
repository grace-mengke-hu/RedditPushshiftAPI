Water

Woohoo I'm feeling it! I always forget that drinking water helps a crap ton. I remembered we have good water at my place and drank 3 glasses. I feel great and now it's just chest pains. Yes it just ONE and a half hour since I had a lozenge, but I am feeling a lot of power over the cravings.

I think I forget to hydrate myself a lot because I grew up with soda, so I substitute it with nicotine.

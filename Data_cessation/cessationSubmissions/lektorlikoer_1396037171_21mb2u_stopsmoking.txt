What the heck is wrong with me?

Okay people, I am almost 2 weeks into a new, smokefree life. During my time without cigarettes I have strongly experienced the positive effects of stopping, my shortness of breath vanished, I feel more energetic, so much even that I can get up early in the morning and get stuff done. I don't have to fear that people find me smelling of cigarettes disgusting. So overall I feel just really really good about stopping, it's like something has returned to my life that was lost before.
But now, although I have all that positive energy, a thought pops into my head. I realise that I will never be able to smoke again (basically a good thing) and that it is something positive, something good that I'm giving up (bullshit). It's not that I cannot go out and enjoy myself without cigarettes but it's rather that I look into the future and picture myself as unhappy for not smoking. I know that returning to the cigarettes will not give me any benefits, it would destroy everything I have worked for in the last 2 weeks, yet still in the back of my head I cannot stop imagining myself sitting on the balcony, lighting one up and enjoying it.
Can anybody even remotely relate to this? Is it just the addiction talking or is there something wrong with me, because I swear to god if I don't get better at tackling this feeling I'm going give in again. So any ideas?

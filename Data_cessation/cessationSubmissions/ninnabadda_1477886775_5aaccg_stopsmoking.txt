Back on the bandwagon.

It's time to quit again and this time, I'm going to focus on being more patient with myself whenever I come across cravings and the emotional situations that cause the worst cravings for me.  I'm going to take time to breathe and listen to myself and wait.

I can't control my cravings but I can work to understand them and I can work to control my reaction to them, even though the prospect of controlling my reactions makes me afraid of failure.

I suppose the fear of failure is just another feeling I need to have patience with.

Also if anyone has any potions for mental fortitude laying around, I'll buy at a good price ;)

Questions About Lung Health

I am only a few days out of smoking so please be nice!  I smoked mostly weed along with loose tobacco for around 5 years and am in my mid 20's.  

I know it has not been long since I quit, but I am still feeling the impact of smoking somewhat (occasional coughing and some difficulty breathing while running). I have some questions about lung health:  

What are some things I can do besides regular exercise to try and help my lungs recover from smoking?
 
Will my lungs be able to heal? 

What are some things that help your respiration?

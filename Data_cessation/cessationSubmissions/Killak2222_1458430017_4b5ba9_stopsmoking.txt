1st Post - Feeling positive but I know the monster is right around the corner...

Almost through Day 5. Hopefully the hardest part is over. Only one major craving so far. I reminded myself there will be times my mind tries every trick in the book to convince me "just one more". I've had a few serious attempts at quitting and I know the big make or break craving is out there waiting for me and I'm not looking forward to it. I read a post earlier about making it so far and "rewarding" yourself with nicotine and as ass backwards as it sounds our minds make it seem so logical. I broke a 50+ streak on Christmas night because I felt like I owed it to myself, I had earned it. And as the nic soaked in it honestly felt great, but then I did the same thing the next night...and the next and then I was right back in the trap. I'm now better prepared for knowing there truely is no "just one more". Good luck guys

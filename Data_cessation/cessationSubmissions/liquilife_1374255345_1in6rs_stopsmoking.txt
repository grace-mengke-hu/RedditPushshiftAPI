One month with NO Nicotine. I don't feel a struggle anymore. My urges are brief and super easy to blow off. More inside

Well, I was a smoker for 20+ years. I had never really attempted to quit until recently. Tried 3 months ago and failed within the same day. Tried again a month ago and never went back!

I started off with the patch and used it for 3 days. It was nice to not be putting tar and crud in my lungs and it was simply very easy to 'not smoke'. Though I still had the crazy addition to Nicotine. On the 4th day I stopped using the patches. My body threw a fit and was not very happy with me. I fought an internal war with myself. Since I found it was easier to deal with the no nicotine in the morning I decided to go to bed as early as I could for the first week or so and get up stupid early. My schedule was waking up at 5am and going to bed at 8pm. It worked. 

30 days with no nicotine has changed my life. In the past week or so I've suddenly been hit with all this energy. I don't feel nearly as lethargic in the evenings as I used to. I feel... normal. 

Folks, I urge you to focus on removing nicotine from your life. I see a lot of posts about the patch and e-cigs making it possible for you to quit smoking... but really the goal is to make it through the suffering of no nicotine and being rid of that vice entirely. There is no 'easy' route to ease the process of quitting. You will have to go through a period of suffering and need to embrace the idea of going through that in order to get to the ultimate goal, which is to require NO NICOTINE in your body ever again.

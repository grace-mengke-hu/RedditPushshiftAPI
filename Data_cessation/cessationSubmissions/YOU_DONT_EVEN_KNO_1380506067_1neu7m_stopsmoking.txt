So I just wanna let you guys know that this is possible. I can still remember back to 1 week or even day 3. Yes, its fucking hard. It drove me insane. No one said this was going to be easy. Everyone knows this is going to be a struggle. This might have been the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But it's all worth it. 

I know right now it may seem as though a cigarette is the only thing that will make you feel better, but you're wrong. Just get through these little battles in your head. Its your own brain trying to trick you. I know the longer you go without a cigarette, it may seem like you'll want 1 more and more. It's the opposite. My cravings have been going down and down as the weeks went on. Now, I can't stand the smell of a cigarette and I have no craving for one. I'm finally free and you can be too. 

The times I would crave the most, I would visit this sub. Write a little something something about how I was feeling at the time then after I was done...GONE. This sub might have saved my life. Go through my history to see how I got here. 

I read Allen Carr's book and I quit cold turkey after that. If you need a copy, please feel free to PM me. 

One thing I've always told people that are quitting -- Cravings do 1 of 2 things; either they make you smoke one or the pass. The choice is obvious. Trust me, they pass. If not, I would not be @ 300 days today. 

You guys got this.

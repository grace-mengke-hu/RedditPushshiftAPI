3 Weeks Down!

I'm killing it. So easy to say "No" now. I don't crave the cigarettes at all but I do miss the act of smoking. 

My first real challenge comes on Sunday when I take my family to Australia Zoo and will be meeting my brother and his family there - he and his wife are heavy smokers so while they won't be allowed to smoke in the park they will no doubt smash couple of quick hits in before we go in and we're heading back to their place for dinner afterwards because they live close by and traffic at the end of the weekend is always a nightmare so we'll wait it out.

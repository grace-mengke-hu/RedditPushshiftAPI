Day 4 - Psychological Sillyness

Hey guys! Hope you’re having a beautiful day of clean air and happy living. I finally worked up the fortitude to quit smoking after 3 years of 3/4 of a pack a day. I had “quit” a few times before, but after reading Allen Carr and doing some research on YouTube, I realized that I was going nowhere fast and it was only going to get worse.

I hope you guys are also feeling that distaste and displeasure towards smokes. But today, it’s not really a physical withdrawal feeling, but I just feel urged to smoke. I just want that nicotine boost I guess.
On our morning walk, I lost my dog for an hour in the woods. It gave me a huge spook, but after finding her (thank god), I’ve been thinking every ten minutes about cigs. I’m gonna take a shower and do some stretches, but I just wanted to vent to you guys. Also feel free to leave some tips on how you shut down the addict in your brain that thinks nicotine is worth all the bad it brings along.

Take care!

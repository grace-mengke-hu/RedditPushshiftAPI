Relapses, and "nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brain of the smokers"

Relapse posts are certainly sad, and I am always struck by the bravery of the posters that want to try again.  It seems a lot of people think they can have "just one" and not become instantly re-addicted.  

Just one smoke can be very physically re-addictive.  Every smoking addiction starts with a single puff.  Cigarettes are an almost perfect addiction vector.  There really isn't much more that can be done to them to make them worse in this respect.  I think requiring babies to smoke would be about the only way to improve cigarette effectiveness.  

I hope I never relapse, but if I do, I know the people of /r/stopsmoking will be here and will understand, and help me start over.  Thanks everyone.

Here are some links that help me understand what was happening in my body when I smoked.  I pulled a few of my favorite quotes out.  I keep these handy.  I hope they help other people.

* Smoking 0.13 (1 to 2 puffs) of a cigarette resulted in 50% occupancy of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs for 3.1 hours after smoking. Smoking a full cigarette (or more) resulted in more than 88% receptor occupancy and was accompanied by a reduction in cigarette craving.

* The short time interval between puffing and nicotine entering the brain also allows the smoker to titrate the dose of nicotine to a desired pharmacologic effect, further reinforcing drug self-administration and facilitating the development of addiction.

* These studies suggest that there are substance(s) in tobacco smoke, as yet unidentified, that inhibit the metabolism of nicotine. 

* After stopping smoking, levels [of nicotine] decline in a log linear fashion with an average half-life of about 16 h.

* The process of cigarette smoking is complex and, as mentioned above, the smoker can manipulate the dose of nicotine and nicotine brain levels on a puff-by-puff basis. Intake of nicotine during smoking depends on puff volume, depth of inhalation, the extent of dilution with room air, and the rate and intensity of puffing (USDHHS 2001). For this reason, machine-determined nicotine yields of cigarettes cannot be used to estimate the dose of nicotine by a smoker (Jarvis et al. 2001). 

* In general, cigarette smokers switching from a higher to a lower-yield cigarette will compensate, i.e., will change their smoking pattern to gain more nicotine (USDHHS 2001).

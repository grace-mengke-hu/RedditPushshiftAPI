Day 19 myself quit cold turkey without any replacements. Just wanted to share something with you guys.

I have a friend who quit for good two months after reading Allen Carr. He was all confident about being a non smoker for the rest of his life. I still don’t why, may be he wanted to test himself, he smoked half a cigarette boasting the he was a non smoker and don’t like the cigarettes at all and got hooked just like that. 
    That ONE CIGARETTE OR ONE PUFF is always a nightmare for me. There is nothing like one cigarette.

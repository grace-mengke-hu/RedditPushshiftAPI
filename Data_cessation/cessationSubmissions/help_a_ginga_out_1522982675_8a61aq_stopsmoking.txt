I exercised twice today!

I am only 21 days smoke free but I feel like I’m seeing my body rebound so fast. I quit for the new year with a slight relapse in February but this is the longest I have done without cigarettes since college! 

I’ve struggled with my weight for years but was in denial about smoking causing my decreased lung capacity. Now that I am smoke free, I absolutely crushed a C25K workout and now I am sure I can finish the program. I also signed up for a groupon fitness class which I dreaded going to but I found out I kept up just fine. I never would have been able to do this much cardio in one day before. 

TLDR: smoke free 21 days. Did cardio twice. Didnt die.

2nd attempt, last one lasted for 3 months, honest question to you quitters out there :) 

Quitting at first seemed easy-ish (kinda) for me at first, the smell, out of breathness, low energy, is still fresh in my memory. But after 3 months, and with those memories faded I find myself looking for a substitute "indulgence" or "Vice" you know, a guilty pleasure of sorts, and i'm sick of falling into the cigarette trap again. Any ideas/suggestions?

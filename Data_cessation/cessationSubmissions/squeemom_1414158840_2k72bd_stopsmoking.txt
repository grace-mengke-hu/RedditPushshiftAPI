Thanks for the reminder brain.

I have a lot of smoking dreams and I've posted about them before but they've always been of the "oops!  I had a cigarette" variety.  

Last night I had a dream that reenacted my anxious chain smoking.  I was waiting for my mom to come back from somewhere and she wouldn't answer her phone. I was worried something had happened to her so I smoked cigarette after cigarette after cigarette while waiting for her to call back.  Just like old times.  So glad I don't have to do that anymore!

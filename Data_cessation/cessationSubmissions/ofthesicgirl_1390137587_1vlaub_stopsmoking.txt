On The Band Wagon

So I've recently found out that I am pregnant, (yay!!) and at 18 i've been a smoker for a little under a decade, and have never attempted to quit before. I want to quit for my health and the health of the baby and wanted any pointers that you guys could offer. So far i have been keeping track of how often i smoke and making myself wait an additional hour after i start craving. I was also curious about how long I have to quit before the baby will be effected by my smoking? Is it immediate? I know it seems like a stupid question but I have absolutely NO idea how this baby stuff work so any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated.

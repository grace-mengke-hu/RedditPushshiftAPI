Day 2- I am a ball of rage

What are some ways to cope with the mood swings?  At this point it feels like maybe the cigarettes were just keeping this extremely angry, easily irritated beast inside me quiet. This is my first time seriously quitting ever. So maybe I won't like non smoker me. I've been smoking for about 15 years now and damn this is excruciating and I haven't even made it through one week. Any tips would be appreciated (or they'll anger me and send me into a fit of blind rage). But seriously anyone who can relate would be super helpful!

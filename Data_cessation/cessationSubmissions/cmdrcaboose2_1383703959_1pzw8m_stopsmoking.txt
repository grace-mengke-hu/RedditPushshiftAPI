I just smoked 2 cigarettes

I'm honestly ashamed of myself.  I've been doing well.  

But I snapped.  I bought a pack.  I smoked two cigarettes in succession.

After the second one, I stared at the pack for awhile.  

It took me 10 minutes, but I finally tore up the rest.  

Here's to starting from step 1 again :/.

Smoking is the worst thing that ever happened to me.  

Day 1 starts now.

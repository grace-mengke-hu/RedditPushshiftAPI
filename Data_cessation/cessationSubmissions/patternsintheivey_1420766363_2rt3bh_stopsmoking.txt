Breaking the Stress/Alcohol link?

I've been trying to quite smoking for good this year. Given that I am an asthmatic exercise enthusiast with a smoke sensitive girlfriend, it should be easy. I've decided to quit smoking not only for the long term effects - which everybody knows - but also the short term effects: effects on the voice (I am both a public speaker and a singer) and on exercise.

Having quit smoking before, I am familiar with the most common success strategies: pick a meaningful day, stay away from triggers, adjust your daily habits to stay away from smoking and smokers, etc. However, the only times when I seem to really want a cigarette are when I when I am stressed or when I am drinking (note: it doesn't take much to stress me out). Having quit before in different circumstances (longest was 9 months), this seems to be both effective and reasonably easy but at this point in my life (28, working a stressful job, trying to break into a different, high stress career path that has no relation to my current job) it seems more difficult to follow. I don't have a large number of friends who smoke, but I do have a large number of stressful obligations that always make me feel 'pushed' to smoke. I have two questions:

1) How do deal with cravings when the stress is omnipresent? Or, how do you reduce stress when the conditions are unlikely to change?

2) How do you decouple smoking and alcohol? In addition to drinking leading to smoking, in the US, drinking is customary. How do you avoid drinking after the evening cocktail or at happy hour?

I don't know if these two questions have been covered many times over, but I pop my head in here from time to time and I would appreciate any insight that you guys have to offer. Thanks for anything you guys have to offer!

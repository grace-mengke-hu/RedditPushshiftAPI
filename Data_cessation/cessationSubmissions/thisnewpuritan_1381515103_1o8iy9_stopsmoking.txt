One week, some tips!

This is the first time in nearly six years now I managed to go without nicotine for longer than a few hours! It's been a habit of mine that started when I was sixteen, and it feels good to be without it. I'm [a little over a week in](http://i.imgur.com/K8ktOAi.jpg) to be precise (smoked a pack a day before, sometimes more). Here are some things that helped me. I thought I'd share, I hope at least one of these is helpful to one of you as this subreddit has helped me a lot over the last few days. 

* Two months before quitting, I would buy both normal cigarettes and light ones. I'd fill half of the pack I'd bring outdoors with regular cigarettes, the other half with light ones. For the last five weeks before I quit, I would only smoke light cigs.  
* The week before I officially quit, I planned "on-and-off" nicotine days. In the (three) off days I would not smoke until 8PM, but in the evenings and on the "on" days I would give myself a free pass and allowed myself to smoke as many (light) cigarettes as I wanted. This was my final 'goodbye'.
* I quit on a Friday night. For the first 48 hours I avoided all social gatherings apart from university duties and I made sure I didn't have to buy any groceries so I wouldn't be tempted to buy a pack in a story nearby. I made sure I kept busy, though: in the morning I would write to do lists, although I'd focus on as many stress free activities as possible. Treat yourself to a marathon of a new great series or read that one book you never had time for in the extra time you have now!
* After my last cigarette, I installed [Quitter for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/quitter/id284944935?mt=8) which tracks the days you've been clean and how much money you saved. It's wonderful to see your progress, and if you're out and about and craving a cigarette it'll remind you to keep going!
* Diet: I allowed a lot of comfort food on the first day and a half, but I tried eating healthier than I normally do for the rest of the week. Trying out new and healthy recipes is a good distraction, plus it prevents you from emotional eating. If you wish to snack, get some of your favourite fruits & veggies. In the first weekend, I quit caffeine and alcohol too. I have been living a very unhealthy lifestyle for the last few months, going through almost a bottle of wine a day (if not more) and an average of at least three cups of coffee a day. The problem is that they would go hand in hand with chain smoking. I picked up coffee again after four days when all nicotine was out of my system, although I did drink green tea on the first days. 
* In the first 48 hours, to prevent the worst of the cravings make sure to drink lots of water/tea and chew gum constantly. I also bought some nicotine gum just in case, but only had a handful of half ones as I eventually switched over to lollipops (I disliked the taste of the nicotine chewing gum).  
* On the first day, I joined the [C25K](http://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) program as a way to shift my focus from craving nicotine to gathering knowledge about running. I have never been good at sports, but it is amazing to see how much more your body/lungs can handle after even 12 hours without nicotine. I am a week in now and almost ran for nearly ten minutes without pausing earlier today, which is something I haven't been able to say for the last six years. 
* I put a Post-It chart on my bedroom door that listed the different stages your body goes through after quitting smoking as listed [here](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/a_benefits_time_table.html). When it'd get too difficult, it served as a reminder of why quitting is beneficial to my health. 


Be nice to yourself. Tell the people close to you about your progress every now and then, but try to get it out of your mind as much as you can throughout the day. It is going to be difficult in the first few days, but it will be worth it. If I, someone without any willpower who used to blame everything on psychological problems and thousand other excuses, can do it then so can you!

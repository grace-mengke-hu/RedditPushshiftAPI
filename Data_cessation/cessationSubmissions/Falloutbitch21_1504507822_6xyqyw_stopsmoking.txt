Almost 17 days without a cigarette and I smoked one. I hate myself for it..

But in a way I'm kind of glad I did it because I've been craving it horribly for a few days now but after smoking my lungs feel so heavy and it tasted disgusting and I never want another cigarette. After craving for days this cig was not satisfying at all and completely turned me off from taking another drag again! I think it was just what I needed to finally get it out of my head. But I still wish I didn't do it. ðŸ˜¢

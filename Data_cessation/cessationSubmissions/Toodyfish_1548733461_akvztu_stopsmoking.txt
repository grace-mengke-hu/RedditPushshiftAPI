A year!

I hit a year tomorrow.  I never thought I could, but I could.  Cold turkey.  I don't even want a smoke anymore, honestly.  The (really) rare time I do want one, I don't even really consider it as a possibility.  I smoked between one to two packs a day for like 17 years(except some extreme party days and weekends I'd occasionally smoke three packs).  I do smoke weed, so there's that, but it's not the same, doesn't feel at all the same, doesn't sate that urge for a cigarette that you get for the first couple months at all.  So yeah, that's all I really have to say.  If I can make it a year, anyone can.  It's not like I quit doing everything else fun like drinking(and occasional psychedelics) either

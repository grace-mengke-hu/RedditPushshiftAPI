Okay, I'm in.

I don't want to get cancer. Something my grandma told me a while back has always stuck with me. She said that something might not hurt you now but it will hurt you later in life. That can apply to a lot of things. Smoking is one of them. The first time I picked up a cigarette was when I was 13. I'm 18 now. It's time to stop.

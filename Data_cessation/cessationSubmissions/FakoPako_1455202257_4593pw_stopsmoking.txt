Sleeping pattern - smoking vs. not smoking WOW!

Finally charged up my fitbit. I didn't wear it for a while, so I decided to get it charged up and start wearing it again.

I was amazed what I saw. A total shift in sleeping pattern. My previous sleeping time was on average 3 hours and 19 minutes. This is with going to bed at close to midnight and waking up at 7:30am. This was pretty consistent everyday. 

Now that I quit smoking, my numbers are: Over 6 hours of sleep everyday, consistent. It's pretty much 6 hours and 30 minutes give or take. I am going to sleep at around 11pm and waking up at 6:30am. 

When I look at the graph, the REM sleep spots are tiny, when before, while smoking, they were lot bigger. It was almost as I would sleep, and then be "awake" for long period of time and then sleep again, when right now, I sleep and have a tiny blip and then sleep again. 

I am convinced that because of me not smoking, my sleep is much better and that is why my energy is through the roof every since I quit smoking. That is why I been so productive since smoking. That is why I actually WANT to workout since I quit smoking. That is why I feel like a million bucks since I quit smoking. This is amazing!

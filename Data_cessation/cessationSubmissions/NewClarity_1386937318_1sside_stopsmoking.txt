So I actually HAVE TO stop smoking, cold turkey, any tips?

Typing with one hand so forgive me if I type somewhat impatiently. This time last week I seriously damaged my hand and I had surgery on it this wednesday, and as a result i'm not allowed to smoke or intake any kind of nicotine at all because it will constrict the blood vessells and could seriously effect whether I get feeling back to my fingers.

I have been prescribed a weeks worth of tramadol which is very relaxing and helping out a lot but i'm not sure what to expect after that as I havent really tried to stop before.

So basically, any tips on how to cope completely cold turkey? No cigs, no patches, no gums no nothing? Thanks :)

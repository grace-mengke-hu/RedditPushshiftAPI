Last one?

I have a serious nicotine romance. Sometimes I smoke 2 packs a day. I have been beating myself up over it for years. The constant trying and failing is heart breaking. I've tried everything. Weaning off,patches, gum,chantix and e cigarettes. I have not tried cold turkey. I am scared of withdrawal. I have smoking related health problems. I feel like if I don't have that first cigarette tomorrow I won't smoke a pack. Like one is not enough but 20 is too many. I have one cigarette left and I hate myself for wanting more. I just found this thread and I hope to god it helps.

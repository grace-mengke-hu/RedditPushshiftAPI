Cold turkey for 2 weeks today, cravings still just as bad as a after the first 4 days - if not worse. When can I expect them to start dying down?

I live a stressful life to say the least. Although I think my pride wouldn't let me relapse, it's still pretty annoying to get cravings on top of everything else.

How much longer until they're not noticeable?

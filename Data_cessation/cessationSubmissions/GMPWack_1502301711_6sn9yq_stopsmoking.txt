I fucking caved yesterday........and I feel worse than shit (emotionally, that is)

I was in the middle of day 5 yesterday, and everything was going well, and I was having a busy day at work......ok....fine. Then some of the other co-workers were asking me for things from the warehouse......ok, no prob. And I also had deliveries coming in.......stress level rising....and I'm feeling a little tired, and the half a pot of coffee I just had wasn't doing it for me.......just take a few deep breaths and keep moving. Then I see some co-workers doing some dumb shit......and I fucking lost it!!! I ripped into him like a hungry tiger and literally told him where I would put his head if he didn't get the fuck out of my warehouse.  When lunch time came around, I went around the corner, bought a pack, lit up and instantly felt "normal" 

Then after all of the anger and tiredness went away, I felt the worst disappointment and shame in my life. I thought I had it this time.....but as it turns out.....I don't think I ever had it. As an intelligent animal, you would think that I would be able to say "hey dumb fuck, this shit is bad for you.....stop it!" But apparently not. 

Yeah, sure, I have a ton going on in my life right now.....but that should not be an excuse to not quit. Yeah, a few days without a smoke and my anger gets the best of me......almost to the point of assault and battery......but that should 't keep me from quitting.......I'll reset the clock when I can figure out what the hell is wrong with me

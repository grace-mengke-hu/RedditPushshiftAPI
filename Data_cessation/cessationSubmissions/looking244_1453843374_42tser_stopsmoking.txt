5 months smoke free -sudden severe cravings

I've been off cigs for just over 5 months. No e cogs or nicotine replacement therapy. I was on 20 a day for about 16 years. I was doing very well, sure I thought about having a smoke once in a while but it was usually a mild fleeting thought at worst a passing 5-10 minute feeling of discomfort.
Nothing stressful has happened but I am craving smoking again as badly as day 1. It's been a week and I get these cravings through out the day. If I'm honest it's getting so bad I am seriously thinking about smoking again. 
Has anyone else had this happen??

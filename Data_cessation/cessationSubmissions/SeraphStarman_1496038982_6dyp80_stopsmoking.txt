My...Bowels

Heads up this post is about poop ! 


So, Its going on a month since I quit the cigs. I think I can stick with it and all this time but, for pete's sake, I cannot poop normally anymore. 

My BMs are completely random, more often, and always... Disappointing, as in they seem less... Substantial than a normal 6 ft+ males should be and what I used to produce. 

This is a really strange post but I don't know who else to ask. Is this normal ? If so, when can I have my bowels back ? 

Thank you Reddit.

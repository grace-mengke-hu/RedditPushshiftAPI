A realization, a dream, and a question.

Yesterday while sitting in traffic for nearly 3x longer than usual I was thinking about what keeps me from smoking and I realized something. The only reason I'm not smoking is because I don't have the cigarettes to smoke. I don't have them because I'm afraid to buy them. I'm afraid to buy them because my bf will know that I smoked and I don't want him to look down on me and my disgusting habit. That's the moment I realized I didn't actually quit for myself. I quit for him. I didn't really want to quit, but I knew I should so I did. That kinda bummed me out a little because I always thought of myself as an independent person who doesn't sacrifice who I am for nobody. 

Fast forward to last night. I'm in crazy dream world and I'm at some party (I should note I haven't been to a party since quitting.) Someone offers me a cigarette and I smoke it. Not all of it because I get so mad at myself I throw it over a balcony and immediately hunt for a computer to change my flair on this subreddit (this is also my first reddit related dream.) I wake up angry, but relieved it was only just a dream and reward myself with the snooze button. 

If it wasn't for my darling bf, then I would still be smoking it up. According to the app on my phone that would be 400 cigarettes, ~ 3g of tar, and $120.44 more than I've smoked/ingested/spent since quitting. I'm glad I'm not destroying my body anymore and I'm going to keep up the good fight. I look to you /r/stopsmoking to answer a strange question. Is it ok to quit for someone besides yourself as long as you quit?

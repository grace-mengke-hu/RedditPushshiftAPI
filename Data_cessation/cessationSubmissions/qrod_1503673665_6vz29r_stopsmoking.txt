A success!

I made a post earlier this week about sleep troubles.

Happy to report that I slept 7 hours straight last night! 

Hats off to the several of you who recommended Melatonin! I definitely recommend this as a natural sleep remedy for those who (like me) are uncomfortable using other sleep aids.

Closing in on a month! I think I'm gonna buy myself some very nice headphones as a reward.

Keep your heads up, quitters!

5 Days Cold Turkey

I usually don’t reddit, so bear with me if I do this wrong. I was a smoker for 9 years since I was 13. I barely remember a time when I didn’t smoke, I can never imagine myself not smoking. The entire time I was learning, and growing, and becoming my own person I’ve been smoking. I have a very strong mental addiction to it. But I want to be done with smoking for good. This is my first real attempt at quitting, and everyone in my life has been super supportive. But I’m really having a lot of struggle with it, I have no idea what’s normal or right. I’ll be completely fine one minute, and then have an intense craving the next and not be able to do anything like a functioning person. I have erratic mood swings out of nowhere, it makes me feel like I’m going crazy. Every time I have a craving I feel like I’m always on the fence of giving up, like I’ve only made it this far from pure luck. I feel like I’ll never be happy or feel like myself without smoking. I’ve never been through something this hard and I guess I’m just looking for advice on what’s normal, or how to make things easier, or better.

4 months in with sudden spike in cravings

I've been doing well with averting cravings but this past week, since getting my 4star badge, my mind has been playing with me.

I keep getting thoughts like *"Go celebrate with a smoke. You can have just one, right? Don't you miss it? Just have one, no one will know..."* throughout my day and I have to put extra effort not to give in.

The way I put these thoughts to a stop is realizing that even if I had one in secret, *I* would know. *I* would hate myself for falling back. *I* would start to feel like shit again all day every day. I'm doing this for me.

I know it's only the ghost of the nicotine monster trying to bring itself back to life at the expense of my well being, which helps me avoid lighting up. Just a reminder to keep your guard up because the cigarettes can lure you in when you least expect it.

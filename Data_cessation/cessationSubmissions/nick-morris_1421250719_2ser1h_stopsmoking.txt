10 Weeks... Why is it this easy?

After nearly 20 years of a 20-a-day habit and numerous attempts at quitting that have ended in me caving completely after a day or so I now find it is 70 days since I last had any nicotine. I didn't want to read the Allen Carr book because I didn't like the smug look on his face on the back but I am so glad I did.

I chose, for reasons I don't quite understand, the most stressful and upsetting time of my life to date (divorce, moving house, death of father, troubles at work...) and yet I have barely had a single craving and haven't missed smoking at all. 

I can whole-heartedly recommend reading the book. Even if you hate the way it is written or the smug repetitive tone. It's worth it. What do you have to lose?

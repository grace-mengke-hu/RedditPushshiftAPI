As a manager, what can I do to support an employee who is trying again to quit smoking as his first step to getting his life on track?

I always give my sincere support and he knows I care. But what could I arrange on behalf of the business that would help him? I considered making a big deal about it but then there's the added pressure on him and problem that arises if he doesn't make it.

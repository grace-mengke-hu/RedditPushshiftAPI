Slowing down to quit with livestrong app

I tried before and got down to three a day. Then life slapped me in the face and I caved hard, getting back up to a full pack a day. 

I'm down to 10 - 13 per day now and trying to get off this habit. The problem is that sometimes I get angry (at nothing) when I haven't had one in a while, and I'm concerned about those first few smokeless days.

Any advice or experience with this? What should I expect?

Need quick measurement for project - Nicotine Gum Size

Hi guys. It's good to see so many people trying to quit smoking. Keep it up! I've never smoked, but my dad did, and was able to quit using vapes and some constant motivation. If you are looking for some extra motivation, it was the greatest thing to see him quit after so long, and to see that he really cared to do it.

I'm posting this because I need a little help. I'm actually working on a project right now for a college class, and need the physical dimensions of Nicotine gum. I live alone, and everyone I know who uses it is probably asleep. 

Can someone measure the length, width, and depth of their nicotine gum, and report it here, along with the brand/product? 

Thank you in advance!

EDIT: I tried searching online and didn't come up with anything.

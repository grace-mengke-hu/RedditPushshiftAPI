My last day ever.

I've had problems with my wrist for the last 3 years. Swelling, pain, loss of range of motion... My primary physician thought it was just tendonitis until last week.

I complained enough that she finally ordered an x-ray and MRI.

As it turns out, the lunate bone in my wrist is dead. Completely dead.

The orthopedic specialist told me today that this would most likely not have happened if I had never had started smoking, and that smoking is what caused my lunate bone to lose it's blood supply and die.

The orthopedic surgeon I spoke to said that I have arthritis in two spots in my wrist. He's going to try to fuse two of the other bones together, but my range of motion will never fully return. He also said he will not perform the bone fusion on me if I don't stop smoking because the chances of it being successful will be so slim.

So here I am. 27, I've been smoking for over 10 years, and because of it I have arthritis in my wrist, will have to change careers (I use my hands. A lot.) and will never be able to move my wrist the same again.

Today is the last day I will have smoked a cigarette. It's gone on too long already.

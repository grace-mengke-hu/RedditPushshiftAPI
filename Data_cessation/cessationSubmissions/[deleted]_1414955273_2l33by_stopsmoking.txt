GUESS WHAT?!?!?!

it really does get better on day three!!! 

as time wears on,

I am a bit hesitant to consume things like caffeine and alcohol and delicious greasy foods- TO EXCESS.

What preempted this quit include two major factors:

- caught a cold

- ran out of funds (student life!)

NOW when i've got a tiny little stack of paper again, i'm a bit worried that i might let hubris take hold, and be all "ooooh!!! delicious after-meal smoke with drink! yyuuuuuum!!"

I have faith though: with each temptation resisted my confidence fucking soars. for example: this morning i sat myself outside on the bench with a coffee outside the library where i usually smoke and contemplate life. and there was a lovely lady smoking those sexy-as-hell uber-thin benson and hedges!!! so close (like really fucking close) was i to requesting to bum a cig.

fortunately my pride is pretty strong- i don't like to beg! so instead i occupied myself by feeding a tiny hermit thrush bits of donut. 

it's important to remember: there's *always* something better to do than smoke a cig. just breathing, watching the beauty of the world around you.....fumbling with your phone. 

the key is when shit really hits the fan.  

haven't dealt with that prospect yet....and don't want to.

to prepare for that imminent time- i think it's wise to begin to incorporate a gym membership into this whole bright-outlook shiz.

right now i'm still taking it hour-by-hour. talking myself out of cravings pretty regularly, with varied levels of success.....so looking forward to the day that passes by without a single craving :)

Day 8: does anyone else find the sudden blood flow increase uncomfortable?

I'm squirming in my seat while training someone at work because I feel my circulation EVERYWHERE (including "sensitive" areas). It's very uncomfortable; I almost want to burn one just to dial this back. How do you combat/calm down the sensation, or is this even a normal problem?

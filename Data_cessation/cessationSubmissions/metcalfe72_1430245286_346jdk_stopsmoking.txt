Forgetting that you quit in initial days

Isn't it funny how your brain tricks you to forget that you quit smoking? I am in the very early stages but I keep thinking about the rest of my day and how I will have a smoke after work.  I'm even explicitly thinking about when and where I will do it, I just see this vision of me somewhere with a smoke in my hand...Then I think...man, that would be nice! Then I come to, shake my head and tell myself that I won't - stupid brain.  I just keep reminding myself that this is what quitting feels like.  This is the feeling of nicotine trying to get the better of me.

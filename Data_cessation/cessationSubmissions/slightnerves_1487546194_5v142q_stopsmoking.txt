Been using Nicorette Lozenges. Working great! But are there any health risks?

I'm thinking because they're administered the same way as dip, that there would possibly be similar oral health risks, but I haven't really come across any solid evidence suggesting that Nicorette lozenges will do that.

Wondering if there are any and if anyone here has experienced some negatives with them. I've yet to encounter any myself.

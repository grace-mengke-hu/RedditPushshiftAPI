Been having a sudden change of mind.

So I'm almost 4 months in and I'm starting to change my mind about quitting. Mostly because my life style is about to change and I'm not sure whether it's because change is a bit scary or I'll find some comfort in bring back an old calming habit.

I should probably put this in, I worry about the smallest things. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, but this sub helps me overcome urges and answers questions I have down this road.

You don't quit smoking, you free yourself from its shackles.

Smoking is not needed to live. Cigarettes make you think you need them. Cigarettes are linked to everything you do, they have attached themselves to your ever day activities, eating, driving etc. You need to detach them from those activities.

You don't need a cigarette to enjoy a meal. In fact the cigarette erases the taste after a couple of drags and you don't even realize it. You don't even realize that a cigarette taste bad anymore, next time you smoke, focus on the taste. Its gross. 

Just always remember, your not giving ANYTHING up when you stop smoking. Nothing enjoyable comes out of smoking. You are not quitting, you are breaking free.

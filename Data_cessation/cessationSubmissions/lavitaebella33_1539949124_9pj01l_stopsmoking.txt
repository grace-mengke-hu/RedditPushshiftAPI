Back to work on day 6. This will be the real test.

There’s been times that I’ve almost left when I got really pissed off but instead went out to smoke. Worst part/best part is once I get there I can’t go to the store to buy cigs until my shift ends or if I quit lol. If I make it through tonight I’ll have 1 week but I’m just nervous because I hate my job, it has been making me depressed as it is. I’ve been looking for a job lately without much success but I did find a seasonal job so if I were to quit at least I should be ok through the holidays (plus saving 250 a mo from not smoking)... any good advice on getting through the work day in the beginning when work is already an issue? Thanks

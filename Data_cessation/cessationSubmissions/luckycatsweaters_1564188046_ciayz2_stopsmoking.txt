Didn’t have to lie before surgery

I vaped for a few years, and last vaped in April 30, 2019. I used patches for 6 weeks starting at 14 mg, so I haven’t put any nicotine in my body in over a month. This morning as I’m prepping for surgery, the anesthesiologist asks me if I smoke vape or dip and my answer was “No,” and he asked me if I did any of the above this morning prior to the prep and I laughed and said “No” again.  It felt so great to tell the truth and not have to worry about any complications due to my nicotine use. Hopefully this can help motivate someone else!

In support of John Oliver, could we change Snoo to Jeff the Diseased Lung?

Ladies and Gents,

I'm sure by now you've all seen the [**clip**](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8) from John Oliver's Last Week Tonight Show that spoke out against the tobacco industry. In support, could we possibly change our Snoo to [Jeff the Diseased Lung](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B98Ghi5CAAEfIju.jpg), if only for a day?

What are your thoughts?

Day 266. 35M

I do miss going out and enjoying that cigarette but the truth is I breath much better now and my body and lungs show me gratitude for quitting by feeling better and more content in my day to day life.  In a perfect world we could smoke and do whatever we wanted with no consequence, but (as of now) we don't seem to be on that type of world and there are often severe consequences for the decisions as to what we allow into our body and diet.

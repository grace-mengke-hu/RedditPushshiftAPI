My first Tuesday without a cigarette at work, and it feels great.

I've been smoking off and on since I was 13.  Seriously picked it back up when I was 17, and now at the age of 21, I decided that I needed to quit.  I've tried about 5-6 times in the past few years to quit, but something happens that causes me to fall short and pick the habit back up.  Not this time.  

It has been 3 days so far since I have smoked my last cigarette, and I feel like today was one of my biggest accomplishments.  See the thing about Tuesday for me is that I have class, and then right after class I have work. Like most college kids, this means food services.  Well, my place of work is a pizza joint that has a five dollar pizza deal on Tuesdays.  This means that during our busiest hours, we are making 250-300 pizzas.  Now, I have never been able to make it through a Tuesday shift without breaking down and having a smoke.  I mean these tuesdays are awful.  But today, I made it through my shift, went home, and played with my dog.  What I did different this time was that I told my co-worker about trying to quit.  So the entire time, especially during the busiest times of the night, she joked with me and basically kept my mind off of stress and smoking.  It really did help out.  


So 3 days in, I have reached this accomplishment, and I am ready to defeat this nasty habit.

That's it.

 i WAS a smoker for ten years, pack a day.  And now i am not.  I read a chapter a day of allen carr for the last month and finished last night.  I just put out the last cigarette of the last pack i will ever buy.  

This feeling might not last forever, i will probably need your help and the help of my friends in the coming weeks, but right now i feel great.

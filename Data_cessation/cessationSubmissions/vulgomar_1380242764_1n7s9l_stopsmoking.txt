Day 11. Yesterday and today were rough.

First of all, 11 days is huge for me. In the past when I've tried to quit I never made it longer than a week. Most of the physical symptoms are gone, but I've found myself really depressed the last few days, especially yesterday and today. I know it's related to the nicotine, and I still don't really want to smoke, but I'm starting to have a lot of thoughts about it.

My resolve is wearing down. Any help is appreciated.

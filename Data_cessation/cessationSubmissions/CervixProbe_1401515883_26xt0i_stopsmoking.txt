Quitting dip. This shit isn't easy.

I started dipping about 2 years ago, my senior year of high school. I dipped solid for about 9 months, then quit for a few months, no problem, just decided not to do it for a while. about 10 months ago, I started dipping again, the last 4-5 months I've been dipping twice a day (that ends up being 6-10 cigarettes depending on what source you use), and if it was a particularly stressful time (had a couple patients die on a 24 hour clinical EMT rotation) it could go up to 4-5 dips per day. 

Anyway, a hospital I want to work at tests employees for nicotine and I need to stop, and i'm trying to be healthier overall. How long until the headaches go away? I stopped a couple days ago and i'm getting my first serious craving.

Also, do any of ya'll know how long it stays in your system? If i could get a date to interview lined up then a reward is in sight and it will be easier.

I'm planning to quit smoking this coming week, noob questions.

I've been smoking for the last 20 years and switched to vaping with nicotine. While vaping has benefits compared to cigarettes It needs to end, I'm fed up of charging the battery and blowing that fancy star trek like device. From my previous attempts the withdrawal was hardcore for the first 5 days at least, from what I remember ten years ago.

I know I'll probably won't sleep at all and go a bit wild but once the physical cravings are gone I think I can handle it. I stopped drinking 3 months ago and thinking to use the same tools to handle cravings. 

Is there anything I'm missing to quitting cold turkey that might help me get through? I'm not worried about anything medical but I'm a bit worried about the hell I'll go through the first week. Any feedback or tips are welcome. Thank you for reading.

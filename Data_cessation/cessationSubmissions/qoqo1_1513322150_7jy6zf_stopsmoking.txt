Is it possible to ever drink again as a non-smoker?

I've quit a hundred times in the past, and damn near every time I start back again is because I go out drinking. Wake up with a pack, and basically just pick right back up where I left off. Anyways, I quit smoking again about 2 months ago and I was just wondering ; will I ever be able to drink again??? I'm not an alcoholic or anything, but I do like to go out have beer with friends occasionally.

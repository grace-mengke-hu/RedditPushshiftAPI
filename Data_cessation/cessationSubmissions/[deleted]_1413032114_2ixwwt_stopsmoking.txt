Letting my little addict cry. Feels like I must knife myself (metaphorically).

I have passed the physical withdrawal of the first few days. Getting along with a small amount of effort. The addict in my brain isn't happy, but it still thinks it's going to get me back. That's the scary part. I want the addict to be wrong. To resolutely quit for good. Then the addict will shrink, cry in pain. And I will let it cry until it dies. I'm trying to get there, but it feels like I must knife myself (metaphorically) to get rid of the addict.

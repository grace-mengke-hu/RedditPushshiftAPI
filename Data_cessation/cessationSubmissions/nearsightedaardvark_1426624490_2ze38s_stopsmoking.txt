I feel like I'm in a no man's land

 I've reached a strange point in my quit where I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't (relapse). Seriously, I have wicked bad brain fog and a general lack of drive but I know that lighting up won't help. The cravings suck but so far they haven't been insurmountable. Has anyone else experienced this weird limbo? I'm still generally optimistic, but I'd also like to know if there's anything I can do to make this bit easier. Also, thank you all for your wisdom and support on this sub. Its been invaluable.

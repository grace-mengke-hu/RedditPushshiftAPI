Quick Tip for those who are about to quit

If you haven't quit already or you're approaching your quit date. Buy a brand of cigarettes that you find disgusting or distasteful (all cigarettes are disgusting) and smoke each and every cigarette consciously. Ask your self why are you doing this? Where is the pleasure? Why do you need them so badly? Once you have quit remember these cigarettes and how much you hate them as well as each and every cigarette beforehand. Even smoke more, making sure you don't enjoy even one and never going long enough between cigarettes for you to crave one.

Any good arguments for quitting vaping?

I quit smoking years ago, and I've been vaping on and off (mostly on). I recently quit for about a month and eventually got back into it by the 0-MG gateway, and now I just feel like it's an unneeded accessory that I'm a slave to, almost.

Part of the problem is that it's not super inconvenient; I can do it indoors, it doesn't seem to negatively impact my health, and it's 'not that big of a deal' (according to people who vape). I feel like I *want* to stop, but I don't feel strongly enough against it to motivate myself.

Has anybody here ever quit vaping, and if so, what was your primary motivation?

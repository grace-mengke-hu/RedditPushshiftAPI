Found out I had mild emphysema, moved to Vaping, Lung collapsed at end of E-Cig drag 3-days in.

I recently quit smoking but smoked cigarettes for 3 more years after the vape-caused collapse and haven't had a collapse since.

Maybe it was just the emphysema combined with the vape but either way, assuming vaping is safe, IMO, is premature for the info we currently have on it.  My guess: this 'it's safe' mindset will be inline with Dr's from the 50's preaching the health benefits of smoking.

Throwaway because I don't share this info with anyone minus a few friends and family.

PS: hospital bill for the collapse was about $30k, and a 1-week stay.

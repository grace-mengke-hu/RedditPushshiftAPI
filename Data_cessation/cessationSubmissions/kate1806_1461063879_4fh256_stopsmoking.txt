HI n Help please

Gave up smoking June 2015 after start of a major mouth reconstruction in Bangkok, had been smoking 1-2 packets per day for 35 years. got home then had a car crash, then got fired. Started nicotine e cigs and 2mg nicotine lozenges before I went insane. New job, then diagnosed with (non smoking related ) cancer , x-rays ( lungs ok ), scans n tests etc, 6 weeks radiation + 2 weeks chemo, 3 weeks after finishing treatment my Mother died after me sitting 10 days by her listening to her beg me to help her, 1 week later tests n cancer all clear, off e cigs n nicotine patches, then 3 weeks later back to Bangkok for part 2 of the new me. Sounds all so good but I hate not smoking plus none of the happy/heathy benefits have arrived after 10 months, am just so miserable all the fecken time and just want to chain-smoke non stop even though I know it is bad for me but nothing is fun, have no energy, not sure if is from not smoking or cancer treatments or my mum dying but I just want to smoke and smoke then smoke some more and I am just so tired, I never felt so bad when I was smoking a packet a day ....I should be happy n healthy with lots of energy but I am not....any help/ideas/insight gratefully received. Thank you

I don't understand why i seem to be different

I see a lot of posts with overcoming the cravings but honestly I don't really have any. Odd I know doing a pack a day for 15 years but hey. Nearly a month in and
I still feel like absolute crap. Can someone please say they went through this and came out ok because right now I feel so alone
I wake up and my chest hurts ,never happened as a smoker
My runningâ€‹ time has got worse
Recovery time worse
I can't cope with running more than 2 miles
I feel sick, no appetite. 
I am exhausted. All the time 
I have spots
Headache
My bowels are screwed right up, constant bathroom trips
I honestly feel happy that I don't smell and hating everything else

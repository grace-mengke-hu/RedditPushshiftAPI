The hive mind is really a beautiful thing in this instance.

It is because of you guys' success stories that I have come this far. Having my first cigarette when I was 10, started really smoking at 12-13 (cliche, it was the cool thing to do). I'm 25 now and smoking for about half of my life had turned into being a chain smoker while drinking. 

My excuse was I only smoke that much when I drink. Problem was I was making excuses to drink every night. Therefore I woke up to an overflowing ashtray every morning. 

Although I always told myself I would stop smoking when...enter whatever BS procrastination you want here, and really was unhappy with my impulsive behavior I would just light one up and forget about it. My motto for life has become "Fuck it" as if that was good enough an excuse to do whatever I please and expect no consequences. 

I have gone since Christmas with out a smoke. I got hammered on New Years Eve at a party, even went outside with my friends that wanted to smoke. I sat there and watched and didn't even crave it. I was sitting there Drunk on NYE and didn't want a cig. Amazing.

You beautiful bastards showed me that people quit everyday. And I then put myself at the front of the line, it was my turn to quit. Its time to grow up and have some responsibility for my actions. It's time to have some discipline. Thank you guys for influencing me to do the right thing. Not only smoking, but my drinking has reduced entirely because of the mindset i have been given reading all your posts. 

TL;DR: Its only been 8 days, but its the longest I've gone in 12 years. My mindset has totally changed, you guys taught me discipline.

today is day 100

without  a single cigarette. the journey was rough at first, but 100% worth it. the absolute only bad thing is, i have gained over 20 pounds in 100 days. i can definitely say i replaced cigarettes with food. unhealthy food at that. 

my plan is to use the money i've saved to buy the new Fitbit Versa! if anyone has any tips on how to get motivated again to lose weight i would love to hear it! 

thanks again for all the support these past 100 days. here's to the next 100.

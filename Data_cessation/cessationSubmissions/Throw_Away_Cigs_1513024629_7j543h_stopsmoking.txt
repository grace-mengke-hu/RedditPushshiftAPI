I need help. How do you do it?

I’ve been smoking for about 8 years and I am so tired of relying on cigarettes everyday. I try, albeit not hard enough, but just can’t seem to kick the habit. I’ll buy a pack, smoke one cigarette, get mad at myself, and then throw them away just to end up doing it again the next day.

I started a company, so the hardest part of not smoking for me is the stress.

How do y’all do it? Any advice would help. It’s time I quit this horrible habit and get my life back.

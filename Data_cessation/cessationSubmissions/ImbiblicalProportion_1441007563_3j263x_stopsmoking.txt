17 year smoker. Just hit one week without a cigarette!

It seems like just yesterday that I had my first smoke but in doing the math I've realized it's been 17 years.  I'm 34 years old... that's half my life smoking.  That's way too long.  

I've been a bartender for the last ten years so my smoking habits pretty much doubled during that time, but now that I no longer work in that industry I saw no reason to continue smoking.  Anyways I went cold turkey and it's been a week since I had a a cigarette.  I almost can't believe it at all.  Last week I was having a cigarette every hour on the hour unless I was asleep.  Nobody in my normal day to day has even noticed so I came here for some love and encouragement.  Thanks!

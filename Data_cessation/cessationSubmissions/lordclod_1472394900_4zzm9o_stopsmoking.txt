31 days, or how 777 hours have passed since my last cigarette

I can hardly believe it. Last night I went to my wife's work and met her coworkers. One of them is a smoker, and he stank like cigarettes. I've read so many accounts of how people who have quit can't stand the smell of cigarettes afterwards; damn, I can totally relate!

I can't believe I stank like that! Goddam!

Perversely, smelling that smell made me crave hard all night. And to top it all off, I had a couple of Cape Codders last night, so the craving nearly became unmanageable! But thank the universe for vaping, especially for nicotine-less juice. I vaped furiously and continuously for a coupla hours.

But I didn't smoke. Another sign post to 777 hours without nicotine in my body, without smoking, and sans stank.

Whew.

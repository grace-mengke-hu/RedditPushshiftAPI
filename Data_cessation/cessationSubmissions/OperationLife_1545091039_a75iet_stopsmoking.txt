Will be Attempting to quit this weekend. Saturday is quit day, need advice.

Hey guys, this Saturday is my quit date because I will be off work for 11 days. Ive been a smoker for the last 13 years (pack a day). Iâ€™ve quit 4 years ago for 8 months using Chantix but this time will be cold turkey. Just would like some advice on how to minimize withdrawals and urges. Any advice is greatly appreciated

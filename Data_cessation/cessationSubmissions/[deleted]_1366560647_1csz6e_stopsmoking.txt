Tomorrow I'd my "stop systematically killing your body with cigs" quit date & pre quit reflections.

1. Is there anyone willing to buddy up/coach/sponsor me? I am the type that can use constructive feedback and the occasional ass kicking. 

I am a Hospice nurse. The million reasons why are in my face...daily. I have been a confirmed smoker since my 16th BD. Smokimg 21-22 years. 1/1.5 ppd. I quit for a year or so in 2000-2001: got run over by a large emotional bus & returned to my comfort/crutch. 

The list of reasons why I am quitting are a mile long. They seem in naught when I lapse to a craving. I have x4 previous failed attempts in the last 3 years. Longes was 4 months. 

I KNOW that my lungs and body cannot take this anymore. I am fully aware that the line of "young and smoking" is behind me. I am 100% CERTIAN that my pulmonary function is poor. 

So...here I go. I had considered using the patch but am really considering the "Buck the hell up and stop" route. If you cannot get out of it....get on with it. 

*my body and health
*my life
*my kids
*money
*time

**The ugly: I have systemic and dermal lupus (a nasty autoimmune BS Dx. Smokimg is REALLY NOT HELPING THIS!) The ugly truth that I have reflected upon....In my subconscious (while meditating on this)**

** I found a F'ed up factoid....Smoking is my "out". Living with a chronic disease is difficult at best. I self-actualized that my continued smoking is my "I won't have to live forever" physical out. This is not healthy or good....**

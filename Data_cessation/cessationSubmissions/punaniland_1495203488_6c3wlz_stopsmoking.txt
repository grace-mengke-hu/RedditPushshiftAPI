Graduated and quit smoking. Any advice?

Since early February, I've been daydreaming about the day of my graduation - the day where I would quit smoking after two and half years of 1-1.5 pack a day. Why? First of all, my family is in all ways extremely against smoking. Second, it hurst my economy and even running to catch a bus leaves me coughing my lungs off. Also, I can see and it feel how smoking has affected the appearance of my skin. 
So, I guess that there are only negative sides to smoking, right? And that thought really makes me want to keep it that way and quit for good. The other thoughts are not even thoughts. They are compulsions from deep inside - that's probably called addiction. But, how do I overcome that? The cravings, the restlessness. Time shouldn't be the only solution - or is it?
Any advice?

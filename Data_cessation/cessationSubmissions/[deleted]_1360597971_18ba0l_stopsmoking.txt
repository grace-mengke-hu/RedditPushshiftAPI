Here we go!

Last year, I made a [post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/sutvb/ive_been_clean_of_cigarettes_for_11_monthsi_just/) about relapsing after 11 months of not smoking.  Since then, I've been on and off with my smoking habit, never quite getting away from it.

Well, I just got back from Las Vegas, where I smoked like a chimney (and drank heavily, stayed up late, generally not being good to my body).  Now my body feels so much like crap that the thought of smoking makes me feel ill.  Seems like a great time to try to quit smoking!  Do my body some good while I recover.  I'll be using the patches since they've worked for me in the past.

Wish me luck!

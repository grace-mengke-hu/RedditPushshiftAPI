3 weeks in, worried I’m getting addicted to vaping instead

  

Hello all. I quit 3 weeks ago because I set fire to my balcony (no joke) and realised what a fucking idiot I was being. I started on a vape but I’m worried that I’ve just replaced the cigarettes with another vice. 

Has anyone tried to reduce nicotine levels whilst vaping? Does that work, or shall I go cold turkey and just get it over with? I’m afraid I’ll start panicking once I don’t have anything to fall back on.

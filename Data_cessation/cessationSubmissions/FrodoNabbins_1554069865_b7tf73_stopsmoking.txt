Kind of embarrassed to ask...

I'm just over 2 months smoke free now and I feel awesome! The only thing is I have this bad stain on one of my front teeth and my embarrassment keeps me from wanting to go out and socialize. Does anyone have experience getting rid of bad nicotine stains? I smoked for 15 years.

Thanks for helpin ðŸ™‚

How do you react to friends' and acquaintances' demotivating jokes about your quitting?

A couple of days ago, I had a conversation with someone who left me with a bitter taste. It happened between a good friend's boyfriend — incidentally a smoker — and me:
"Would you like a cig?"
"No thanks, I quit 2 months ago."
"Oh yeah? We'll talk about it again in 2 months."
I made my best "I-am-a-confident-person" face and smiled, but I wish I had found a better answer.
Do you have friends or acquaintances who have made fun at you for quitting when you told them so?

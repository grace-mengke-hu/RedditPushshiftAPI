Advise regarding patches.

Hey guys,

I'm trying to quit. I've had two previous attempts in the last 12 months (2 months and 3 months) and both times I was a stupid twat and slid back into it. I'm having another go.

I really struggle with being out drinking. Where I live (Vietnam) we drink outside at bars most of the time so everyone is smoking away, and at 50c a pack, it becomes really ingrained, more so than the West.

Anyway, I want to try going cold turkey during the day, and then putting on a patch in the evening to see me through, then give those up in 2 weeks or so. 

Is this a good idea? I currently smoke about 25 Marlboro reds-type cigarettes a day if that helps. I'm thinking about going to see a doctor, but I thought I'd ask you brave soldiers over here your advise.

Thanks in advance,

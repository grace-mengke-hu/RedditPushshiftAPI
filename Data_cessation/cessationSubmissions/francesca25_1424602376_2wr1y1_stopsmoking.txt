I failed so badly

I had en english competition today. This was something I have been waiting for eagerly, as I dreamt of being the first and qualifying to the nationals. I did a very bad job at it today. I was about 50 words over the 350 limit and I wrote so much nonsense. I am now pretty terrified that the first thing I'll do when I get home will be to smoke. Which sucks because I was pretty excited to get the star.

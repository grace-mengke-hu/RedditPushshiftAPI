cigarettes smell AMAZING?

Day 19 here, going strong. I live with a smoker, often times I have to turn on the air-con to filter the air & open windows when she's smoking. My question is, why do cigarettes smell amazing? They definitely smell different from when I smoked, they smell 20x better!! It's driving me nuts..

Last pack of my life.

I came to Alaska for the summer with the hopes of quitting. I didn't raise the amount I smoked before I came out, but I surely didn't stop. I'm telling myself this is the last pack I buy, but I fear as soon as it's done I'll be off to the store. What can I do to keep that from happening? I'm so sick of this.

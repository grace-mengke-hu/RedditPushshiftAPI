Guys, I fucked up!

2 days ago [I posted here about me getting to 10 days](https://i.redd.it/hwozpsjzsn611.png). And in the comments I wrote about how I don't see myself smoking anytime soon.

Well, yesterday around 10 friends and I went out on a trip for a day and a night. Literally every single one of them smokes. We had drinks and BBQ, we swam, and then we drank more and I fucked up.

I have no idea how I justified it to myself. I remember thinking things like : "It's not as if I'll remember it anyway" (I do). "Eh it's just one, and we are having fun it won't really change much". And other bullshit excuses.

Well, spoiler alert : I didn't have just one. I ended up smoking at least 10 throughout the day. And today before driving back I asked a friend to give me an extra one for the road.

Before lighting that last cigarette the guilt started to settle in. I ended up throwing it away and I'm back at my quit. The cravings are stronger than they've ever been in my 10 days but I'm not gonna smoke today because I know if I got a pack I'll be back to 1 pack a day in less time than it takes to say "oh shit".

As another motivation, I won't be resetting my smokefree app/badge as long as I stick to my word and not smoke another one. Also, next time I'm hanging out with smokers where drinks are gonna be involved I'm gonna ask them not to give me a cigaratte if I asked for one. I thought about doing it today but I thought it will show me as weak to them. Well, now I proved I am.

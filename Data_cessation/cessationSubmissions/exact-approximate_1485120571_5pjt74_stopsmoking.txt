4 Weeks

Celebrating 4 weeks today. Wow.


I feel like quitting smoking has removed a coping mechanism for things I don't like. Previously I would take my anger out on a cigarette, and all would be ok. Without cigarettes, I am left to actually deal with the problem at hand.


For example, today I had a fall out with a friend who hasn't been respecting me for a while. Previously I would smoke to help get over the negative energy, but not today. I'm not sure whether this fall out was triggered by quitting smoking or not (because I'm now more irritable), but the bright side is that they were a group of people who always helped foil my previous quits and I'm now (at least temporarily) rid of them.


On the plus side, I will be able to really push forward with my change in lifestyle. On the negative side, this is bound to cause some loneliness and boredom which might make me relapse.


On to the next week. Looking forward to hitting 1 month!

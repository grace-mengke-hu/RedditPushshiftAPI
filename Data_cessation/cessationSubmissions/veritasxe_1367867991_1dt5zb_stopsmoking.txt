Approaching second month, constantly seem to be sick?

I'm approaching my second month since my quit date, and I seem to be getting sick constantly. There seems to be a constant tickle in my throat, or my voice is flat or my sinuses seem to be inflamed. Is this normal?

Aside from that, feels great! Going to hop off champix soon as well.

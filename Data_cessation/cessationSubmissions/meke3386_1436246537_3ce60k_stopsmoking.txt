And then back to square one..

Legit question: do you kick yourself every time you "give into the urge"? 

I did tonight, I felt so "out of control" that my vape wouldn't even cut it. Afterwards, I felt so guilty and know that my BIGGEST supporter (My husband) would be horrified, disappointed. But this time, I know I screwed up and didn't even get emotional. Today (day 3) was the longest I've ever "quit" I just got to figure out how to stop the wanting.. I felt so much better when I wasn't smoking, I am an allergy sufferer and have a stuffy nose 24-7. 

So, I'm literally starting all over again tomorrow/tonight.  

I CAN DO THIS!

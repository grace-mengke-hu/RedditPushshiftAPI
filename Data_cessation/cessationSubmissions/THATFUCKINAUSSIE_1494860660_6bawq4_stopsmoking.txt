Over one month down!

I posted on here about a month ago celebrating a week without cigarettes. It's now been 1 month and 1 week and I feel amazing. Food is great, smell is great, life is great, and I'm way less tired all the time.

Bonus news, although I've been smoking for 12 years, I've went and gotten the full check up. I'm happy to report absolutely zero damage to my lungs. Heart rate, blood pressure and circulation are all perfectly normal, and my lung capacity is even 30% greater than that of a non smoker my age!

I just couldn't be happier. I'm so glad I quit when I did, and I'm even more astounded that I haven't caused any long term damage due to my many years of ignorance or laziness.

Here's to infinite more fucking months of no smoking! ðŸ˜¬

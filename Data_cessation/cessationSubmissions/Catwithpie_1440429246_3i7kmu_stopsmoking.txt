Is vaping considered quitting?

I'd like to move away from tobacco. I have done so for a few months in the past by using the vape, and for about a year I used neither. Obviously that did not stick. I'm wondering if I quit tobacco just to move to a vape am I actually quitting? I'll still be addicted, still spending money on something that can't be too healthy. Having the vape significantly helped me move away from tobacco though. Not sure how to approach my quitting this time around. Any suggestions here?

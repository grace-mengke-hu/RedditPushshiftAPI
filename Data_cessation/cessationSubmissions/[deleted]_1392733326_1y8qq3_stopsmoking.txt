Good advice books for quitting smoking

I need to quit smoking. I've been smoking for 3 years and it's starting to affect my health. I'm down to five a so a day but I can't quit the last few. 

What is a good no-nonsense book for quitting smoking. I don't want some spiritual shit, or anything that comes with somebody's 'special plan' - just helpful, level-headed advice. Any suggestions?

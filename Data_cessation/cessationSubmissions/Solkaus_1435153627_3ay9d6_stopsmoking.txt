Learning how to live

I've never been a reddit fan, but a friend of mine showed me /stopsmoking/ and it's actually REALLY helpful, so I salute you all.

So, long story short, my last cig was on May 10th, 45 days ago. I feel good, I'm building up some body mass at the gym, and everything is awesome. BUT.

I realised I don't know how to live. I had all these routines around cigarettes like the breakfast cig, the going out cig, the about-to-enter-a-building-cig, the on-the-phone cig, the coffee cig, the bedtime cig, the woke-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-so-why-not cig, and dear lord those are just the ones I remember right now. We're talking 2 packs a day, and I think I only "enjoyed" like... maybe 2 or 3 of those, the rest were just the force of habit.

So the problem is... I really don't know how to live without smoking. I'm not even considering going back, but I'm kinda having a hard time.... living? Doing stuff? Do you guys have any suggestions for a situation like this?

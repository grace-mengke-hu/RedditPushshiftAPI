quitting early

I was working up to quitting later on. I smoked my last cigarette 24 hours ago.
I'm almost going nuts so I allowed myself a piece of nicotine gum. It seemed almost like a matter of safety.

To reinforce my decisions to quit, I'm posting a revised version of a journal entry.

Reasons to Quit Smoking:


Financial—smoking costs well over $3k per year. Holy Shit.

Romantic—Smoking has all but completely ruined any potential with two separate beautiful women.

Health—Smoking keeps me from running, working out, being and feeling healthy. It increases my sense of lethargy, both when I do smoke a cigarette or if I go without.

Cultural-- It is obligation to my people to quit.

Professional-- With career goals of being a health educator, it would be best to be a healthy person and a role model.

General Wretchedness—I want to be a clean, organized and disciplined person. Not a dirty, disgusting slob.

Health scare last night

36 m here. Been smoking 15 years. I have been wanting to quit for about 3 months and have barely put forth an effort.  I really tried 1 day and went 12 hours.  
Last night at midnight I started feeling horrible.  Shortness of breath,  tingling in my chest, it wasn't painful.  It was more discomfort and I knew it wasn't right. I had my wife take me to the ER. I was scared but was super brave for her. I'm glad my daughter was at the grandparents.  

I was at the hospital about 4 hours. EKG, xray, blood work, BP, was all good. Monday I'm calling a specialist they recommended for more tests to be safe. They believe it may have been acid reflux.  

I had been ignoring signs and shortness of breath too long.  As of 12am 5/11/19, no more cigarettes for me

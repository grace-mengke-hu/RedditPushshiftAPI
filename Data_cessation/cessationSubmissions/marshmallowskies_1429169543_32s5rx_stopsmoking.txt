I'm spending night #3 in the ER waiting room. I really, really need to talk to someone right now.

I feel like every time I try to quit smoking life just pokes and prods at me.  "Hey-- you felt stable enough in life to quit smoking? How about your uninsured boyfriend gets an upper respiratory infection, you get evicted from your house, your aunt gets cancer.... Now how do you feel about quitting?"

The list goes on.  My boyfriend is the one who has kept me sane through this, and now he's in triage being seen by a doctor.  I know I have at LEAST 2 hours of waiting before he's out, and all I have to do it sit in the waiting room, hating life.  

I could EASILY go out, buy a pack, smoke one, trash the rest and de-scent before he's even discharged and he'd never know.  I won't do it.  But I want to.  When I quit I get depressive, unpredictable, and impulsive.  I used to have self mutilation problems and that always rears its ugly head by day 3 without cigarettes.

6 months ago, I was smoke free for 9 months.  I can do this.  But please, will SOMEONE talk to me? Just PM me now.  I need to talk.  About anything.  I feel like I'm breaking down and I have nobody to call.  Please.

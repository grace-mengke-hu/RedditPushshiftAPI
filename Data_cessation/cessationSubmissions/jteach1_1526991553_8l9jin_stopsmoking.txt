A non nicotine alternative

So I quit smoking cold turkey almost 2 months ago. Although I am not craving the nicotine anymore I am craving the action of smoking. This is obviously not a physical thing but more mental. And I am now eating more to replace my habit. Is there a non nicotine alternative like an e -cig of some sort that I can just puff on but doesnâ€™t have all the yucky stuff in it? If you know of something please tell me the name. Thank you

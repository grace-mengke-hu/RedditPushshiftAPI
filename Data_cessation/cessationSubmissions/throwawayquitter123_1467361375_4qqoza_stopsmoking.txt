I've decided to quit, but I can't do it yet.

So I have this thing, whenever I quit something I subconciously ween myself off of it. 

I quit drinking rather easily by drinking very heavily and giving myself excuses for my drinking (other people do it) before finally just quitting. 

Now, why am I posting? I'm wondering if this same method is possible.

When I quit drinking I first became disillusioned with it. I stopped thinking it was a normal habit which most people did and then slowly stopped without even thinking about it before finally saying "I need to quit". 

I want to do the same thing with cigarettes. Is this possible? 

Also my biggest problem with smoking is that my brain keeps trying to talk me into smoking. I'll tell myself over and over that there's no way I'm stopping at the gas station. Then I realize I need gas. Then I imagine myself buying cigarettes. Over and over and over. I can't just finish a pack and then stop. What can I do?

Broken jaw/Day 8 no smoking

I am 36f. I have been smoking since I was 16. I have quit multiple times before but this time it wasn't even my choice. Long story short my jaw was broken last Saturday and I have not had a smoke since. Hell I have been in so much pain I haven't even thought of smoking much. I know if I do it will dry out my jaw and cause more pain. I very much dislike how my quit started but I will not fail myself this time.

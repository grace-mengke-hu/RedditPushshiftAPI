I need help for my dad!

I am 16, and my dad is 40. He NEEDS to stop smoking. He's tried a ton of thing from gum, patches, electronic cigarettes, and a hypnotist. I want to help him but don't know how. I want to get him Allen carr's book because I heard it would help, but I don't know. Can anyone help me?

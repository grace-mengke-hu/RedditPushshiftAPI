Day 22. A few notes on quitting

So this is my 22nd day of not smoking (after 21 years) and I wanted to highlight some benefits/ things I’ve noticed as of quitting.  I really hope this can get some people to stay strong I. The first three weeks (I’ve heard it’s the hardest).

1. Money (I’ve opened a savings account just for cigarette money) after 3 weeks it has $337 in it.
2. Learning to breathe again (I have realized that I take breaths like I used to and I get light headed now.  I have had to learn to take more shallow breaths)
3. Smells; after the first few days my nose was going bonkers, I could smell only the worst smells (I live in a major metropolitan area) and for a week everything smelled like trash/urine. That went away and it normalized, thank chtuthlu.
4. Sweating; I have always been a seriously sweaty dude, big time! The greatest benefit if quitting smoking is I sweat so much less! I used to have to change t shirts at least 2x a day. Now, I’m dry as a bone pretty much all the time! I feel physically more comfortable everywhere temp wise.  This means I sleep more comfortably, I spend less on laundry, I don’t look incredibly comfortable at all times, and I can wear so many more clothes comfortably (I seriously would sweat profusely in any temp above 65f)
5. My face is thinner?  I don’t think I’ve lost weight in my face, but it’s certainly thinner, noticeably, most of my coworkers have asked if I’ve lost weight (gained 4lbs).

I just wanted to post this and hope it helps someone as much as this sub has helped me!  Thanks everyone on here.

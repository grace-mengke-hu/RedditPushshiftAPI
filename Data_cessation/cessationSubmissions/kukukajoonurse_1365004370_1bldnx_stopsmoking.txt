One more time....

This isn't going to be easy but I am confident this will be the successful time..... 

My health and possibly my life depends on me stopping and yet its been near impossible in the past. 

Any tips and advice to get through these first few days and be successful? Tips, tricks, anything.... I NEED to be done with this awful habit.

Also on an aside- has anyone used the nasal spray (nicotine) to help them stop?

51 Days!

I smoked for 14 years. Kicking this habit was the best shit ever. I've been working out, my teeth are becoming white again, food smells and tastes better. Drinking with friends is more fun because I don't have to step outside to smoke alone, and best of all I never worry about "Do I get food, or smokes? I only have a few smokes" Keep it up people.

Sick of going through the ringer with smoking. Need help and have some questions.

I've been through the ringer with smoking, and have even posted in/belonged to this sub before.  For whatever reason, I just can't seem to get over the hump.  The nicotine withdrawals don't really effect me physically (i.e. I don't feel a tremendous "need" to smoke, and I don't feel physically ill like some other substance withdrawals would make you feel), but they do make me excessively mean, vile, and irrationally angry.

Last night I smoked a cigarette after not smoking for two and felt like the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders.

Should I have weaned myself down to make this easier? Should I use a patch or a vaporizer? Just I just bite the bullet and be a disgusting son of a bitch for however long it takes to get out of my system? I feel like I have the potential to just snap or lash out and hurt someone... Like I'm completely out of control.

Also, are there any iPhone apps you can recommend?  A friend was showing me one on his droid that was showing your "health improvements" over time...

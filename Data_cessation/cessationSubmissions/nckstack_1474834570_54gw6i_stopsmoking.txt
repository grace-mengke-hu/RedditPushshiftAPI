1413 days and the last 180 have been a lie!

I am reseting my counter to day zero today, I just smoked my last cigarette for good after starting up a few months ago again just from friends smoking from out of town and me being stupid and smoking with them. one thing led to another and I was back again smoking a pack a day for the last few months. Today is the day I stop again, I mean it this time, I am done. Resetting in a few minutes and I can not wait to watch the days grow in number again! wish me luck!

My take on quitting.

Ive been smoking for around a year now. Not like many people here but I've had a very hard time to quit. Almost impossible. Well. Pretty impossible for me at least. I will determine the quit the night before after a day of smoking either electronic cigarettes or real cigarettes and in the morning its the first thing I do. Tomorrow morning will be my biggest testament. 

What I've realized is that I need to make myself comfortable at all times. I cannot, do anything that will cause me anxiety. If someone tells me to do something, unless I am getting paid for it, I will do it my way. All the anxiety needs to be thrown out the window. If someone is paying me to do something or I need to go to school or whatever, fine. But I am doing anything and everything to keep myself comfortable at ALL times. Even if I need to binge on some food or something or a soda or whatever the fuck it is at the beginning I will do it. I can lose the weight, I'm still young. What I wont have is my health in the future if I dont stop smoking. 

If I have to sit outside in a far away place or take a walk to get away from people. Or not be submissive in affairs regarding family or friends, I am not going to do it. I need to FEEL comfortable at all times. If I'm not, fuck that, because that gives me anxiety. I smoke to curb the anxiety. What makes it worse is that the anxiety doesn't even get to be dealt with. It's the saddest thing in a world for someone to sit in a corner and smoke because hes anxious, and the anxiety persists. This is what has been going on for me. I hope I keep going and I am happy to give my insights to the community. Thanks.

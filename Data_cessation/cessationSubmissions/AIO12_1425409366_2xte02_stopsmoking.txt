2 years! Unbelievable!

Hey everyone. Just wanted to take a minute to thank you all again. This sub was such a tremendous help to me during my first few months of cold turkey. 2 years later and I actually laugh at the thought of being a smoker. I no longer regret the time I spent smoking and instead I accept that it's just something I did and I'm grateful I no longer do. I still firmly believe that I can do anything I want after escaping the ball and chain cigarettes had me locked in. 

The best advice I can give is to never get down on yourself. Embrace the feeling shitty and the moodiness as evilness escaping your body. If you break and take a puff, don't consider it lost time. Be happy you went as long as you did without one smoke. Now throw those damn things away and try to go longer next time. I've seen too many people quit for 35 days just to get super down on themselves and all of a sudden they are every day smokers again. It doesn't have to be that way.

Thank you all again, and good luck to all quitters present and future!

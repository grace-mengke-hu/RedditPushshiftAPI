Psychological roots for cravings

I’m wondering if any of my fellow quitters here ever dug deep and considered what mental process triggers their cravings?

I know that some of the most popular examples will include things like drinking, social situations, stress, excitement, trauma etc. etc. I started wondering why for example stress can be a trigger? Why do I actually want to smoke when I’m stressed? What particular process takes place that leads my brain to this solution?

And I think I stumbled upon a simple answer buried deep in my unconsciousness. 

I know that some of you have probably become reliant physically on nicotine by a chance encounter - probably socialising at high school/ college and there’s no ‘second bottom’ to this. This is how I started smoking.
But over the years cigarettes became somehow associated with the fact that I unconsciously feel that ‘I don’t deserve’ or ‘I’m not good enough’ - and they’re my form of self-destruction ritual. I want bring myself down to my addict’s reality through smoking whenever I feel like matching to my hidden insecurities. 

Since I pondered on that, it became SO MUCH easier to battle each craving - it’s unbelievable! I wondered if any of you have had similar thoughts?

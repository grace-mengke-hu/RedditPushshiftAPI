I can stop... But I can't

14 year smoker. Sometimes a lot, sometimes not a lot. Pack a day, pack in two weeks kind of smoker.

If I'm with the folks I don't want to know I'm smoking I can go days without, without losing my mind.

If I'm left to my own vices, I can burn a pack in an evening.

Why can I go days without, but not an hour when I'm alone? Why can I be perfect in front of my wife, who is OVER IT, yet not last 10 minutes when I get a window?

Why am I disappointed in myself because I smoke, but smoke because I'm disappointed in myself?

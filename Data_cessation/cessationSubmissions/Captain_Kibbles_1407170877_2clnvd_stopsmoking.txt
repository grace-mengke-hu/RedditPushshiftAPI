How to deal with social smoking while quitting

Some of the best conversations I've had with people throughout college have been outside of bars/parties while me and my friends were smoking.  

I've received some great advice in helping me quit so far from here, so what sort of tips would you have for joining in on these conversations but avoid smoking?

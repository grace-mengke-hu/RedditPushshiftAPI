50 days

50 days smoke free. Cant believe it. I have already forgotten why I quit in the first place but there was a reason so I'm not starting again.

Also passed my first big test. Insurance company asks me to pay for car accident expenses because I made a mistake (I didn't contact with my insurance company because accident was my fault I thought only the innocent one has to (in my country you can fill in car accident documents which we did) . Apparently I was wrong and I had to contact them and according to law they have right to ask me to pay 100% of the expenses. Which sucks because I have no job, no money and wanted to go to university to get a degree this year. I'm really scared about what's to happen next, first thing when I got mail from them I was so stressed out I was about to  go for a walk and get cigarettes but kinda calmed down few minutes later and realized cigarettes won't solve anything. I just had to share this with you because I don't know what's gonna happen next since I can't afford to pay them and I'm very lonely so have no one else to share my sadness with.

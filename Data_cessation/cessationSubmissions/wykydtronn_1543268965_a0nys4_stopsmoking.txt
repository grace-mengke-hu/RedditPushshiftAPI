I dunno if I Can do this

So I tried 11/24... basically failed found one old cigarette in a closet and smoked it mid-day after my usual "stressers" (90% of my smoking triggers are my home life, autistic kids will be like that).    Then failed further, I ran down to the store and bought a pack of Black and Milds (At least it wasn't cigarettes.) Proceeded to space them all out till sunday night, when I put the last one out.

Ok first day at work.  I didn't feel too bad till I got to the end of the day and now I'm home and I just wanna fucking scream and punch walls.  I fucking hate this, I don't have fucking time to feel this way.  

Like seriously, I don't have time to feel this way and I have no idea what I was thinking from even attempting it.  Too many fucking people constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY depend on me being 100%.  But I could rant for hours on that and now I'm afraid I'm seriously going to fucking snap at some times... like every other time I Tried to fucking quit.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't even really wanna quit, I just have too because it's fucking up my teeth.  which makes me so fucking angry. I only smoked for like 11 years, so many other assholes get away with smoking for decades longer and of course I'd have to get the shit genetics.  My teeth are falling out and now my chest hurts on occasion... how is that fucking fair?  So many folks get literal Decades of enjoyment and I get the shit end of the stick?  The two vices in life I've ever truly enjoyed are coffee and cigarettes and now I'm losing one and it sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm either fucking bored, or stressed... I don't know how to cap off any achievement.  I really don't like other things.  I'm not a "foodie" I hate alcohol, and yea.   Nothing makes me feel like a smoke.   A smoke use to be my reward for a job well done, my little escape from the constantly "Can you do this?" "Hey can you fix this?" "Can you get me a drink?" "Can you?"  and now I don't have that escape, stanidng outside doing nothing makes me feel like a useless jackass.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds fucking weird, but I really after years of also being a cook, kind of despise food.  I eat for fuel... so replacing my smoking urge with just eating sucks.  I don't actually enjoy eating all that much, it's just fuel, it's boring, it's kind of stupid in my opinion.  It's literally just calories to make you move, that's it.  Why do people obesse over this bullshit so muc c

Gawd sorry for ranting, I just fucking hate having to feel this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Also Allen Carr's book, what I read of it, was 30 fucking pages of him stroking his massive fucking ego,.  Fuck him and fuck his book.   Don't waste my fucking time with your testimonials are constant... self congratulatory patting on the back.  Dude would literally suck his own fucking cock if he could he sure thinks everyone else should, Mr. Magic let me spend even more pages telling you about how I'm smarter than  the entirety of the medical establishment.    I literally got nothing from what I could read, I Couldn't stand his constant... and I mean constantly ego stroking of himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if you like him, but that shit made me really really wanna smoke more just to spite his ass.  Learn to write a concise sentence with out stroking your own dick.

Sorry some one please ban me or something I'm just fucking so angry I have to go through this.

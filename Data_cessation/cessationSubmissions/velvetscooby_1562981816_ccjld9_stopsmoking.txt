Day 12. I was reflecting earlier that today was the first day that I don’t remember actually thinking of cigarettes at all, and it was the best feeling!

Every day up to this point, I’ve at least thought about them. Not in the sense that I wanted one, but that up until so recently they had been an engrained part of my life, and so much of my daily routine revolved around them. 

Today, I don’t think they even crossed my mind, for the first time. 

Until just a few minutes ago...I was chatting in my drive with a neighbor and he pulled out a pack and lit up. 

I think I had a nearly instantly visceral reaction and instantly turned by body away, because I though, oh hell, I don’t know if I’m strong enough to resist this temptation. 

But, I actually felt apathetic watching him smoke. I completely surprised myself. 

(And then I apologized and let him know that I had just quit, in case I offended him, because it wasn’t about him...just that I was worried I wasn’t going to have the gumption to not jones for one and it was the first time i had been in the presence of another smoker!). 

Thanks for letting me share, it helps to have a little place to write some thoughts.

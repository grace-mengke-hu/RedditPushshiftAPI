How do I start quitting?

Backstory. I've only been smoking two years and I've never gotten to the point where I smoked a pack a day or the such. But I've been trying to quit only to be assailed by horrible withdrawal symptoms the worst being the anxiety attacks that are just destroying me. Does anyone have tips that'll help me kick these death sticks?

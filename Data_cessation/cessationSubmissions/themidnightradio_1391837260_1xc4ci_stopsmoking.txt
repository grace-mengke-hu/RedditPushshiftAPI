First day

I just went 24 hours without a cigarette for the first time in a decade. All day at work I kept thinking, " I'm going to step outside for a minute" before remembering I don't smoke anymore. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, though, I merely just laughed at my forgetfulness. Whenever the urge to smoke hit, I just worked that much harder and doubled down on my focus. I even went out for drinks after work and didn't cave. I can honestly say that I've not been so proud of myself in a very long time. I just wanted to share that with you guys and gals.

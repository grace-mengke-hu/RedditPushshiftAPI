Quitting while my husband still smokes...

I started smoking when I met my future husband as an older teen. It's been over 7 years now since I started smoking and i've stopped on a number of occasions for good lengths of time, my longest being somewhere around 7 months. We both want to start a family and I don't really like cigarettes and they aren't good for a pregnancy.

I stopped smoking last Thursday when I stumbled upon this subreddit and decided enough was enough. I put a post it note on my pack of cigs that said "Stop, -you" and it worked pretty well for me. The problem I am having now is with my husband who still smokes at the house and smells like it and everything.

I don't know how I can separate the cravings for a cig (which for me are ENTIRELY mental and not physical) and my agitation with my spouse for still bringing cigarettes around and still smoking at the house. What can I do to help this or anybody have any advice for both sides, cause I'm sure he'll come creeping on this before long...

P.S.-- Regardless of everything, I'm thankful for stumbling along this subreddit and I really liked how supportive everyone is to other posters.

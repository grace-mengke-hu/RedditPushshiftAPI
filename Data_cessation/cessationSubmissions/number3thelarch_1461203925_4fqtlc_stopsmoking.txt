Went to a club (victory is mine!)

21 days in â€“ got absolutely blackout drunk last night and did not even think about smoking, when usually I'm the sort of grumpy bastard who spends most of their time in the smoking area.

Was so worried about drinking/clubbing triggers but was fine! Even though I was out with a smoker. 

Sorry for the brag, but irl no one gets it: smokers think I'm insane and never-smokers don't see what the big deal is. Keep going everyone!

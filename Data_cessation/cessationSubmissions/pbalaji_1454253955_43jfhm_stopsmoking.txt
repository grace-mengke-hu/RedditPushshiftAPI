Beyond Six Months

I just want to tell new quitters, See the non-smoker habbit in long term achievement. If you smoke a cigarette after quitting, don't give up.. Because after three months, if you look back one cigarette or even few cigarette in three/six/twelve months would not be a big deal.. Why I am saying this is, About 10th day of quitting, I smoked a cigarette. That was a team dinner. That cigarette was not bought by me instead my colleage gave coz, we have had so many smoking sessions.. Why I didn't reveal my quitness to my colleage is, If I would fail, He/They will say that even I too tried many times, but will not be too long (in single word, discourage/insult).. Even after that in about 70th day of my initial quitting, I smoked a cigarette again.. But this time, It was not even a colleage; It was given by colleage's friend.. But since, I didn't had a single puff.. Also I forget about that habbit (yes, I mean smoking).. So, at any cost cut the friendship with the person(s) who discourage you, It means you are already stopped 50%.. Even I forget that I had crossed six months in the exact day..

Finally, I am nearing 200 days without the cigarettes..

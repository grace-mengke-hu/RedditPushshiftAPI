After 6 years I am officially unsubscribing from this sub. - Wish you all the best.

After 6 years I am officially unsubscribing from this sub. This sub did provide help to me, knowing that others had made it through. I tried many, many, times to stop smoking and finally found success. To all of you starting out, this might be your first time trying or your fifth, stay strong I can promise you it is worth the struggle. The day will come when you will pop in the bodega or quickie mart without even glancing at the smokes behind the counter. Good Luck, and all my best.

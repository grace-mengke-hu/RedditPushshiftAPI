I drank and didn't smoke!!

Sorry, feel like sharing this with anyone and everyone. I gave up the drink and coffee with cigarettes; purely because I associate both with smoking and when I drink I have very very little self control.

Last night I went out with a few work friends, all of which were smoking. I had 6 lolly pops which I demolished one by one. I was constantly looking at everyone's smokes and even took one out of a pack and smelled it. It was the toughest and closest I've ever come but I didn't do it!

Side note : 'quit' for 3 months but drink smoking kept me anchored and could never fully escape.

Sorry for the long rant. Just super proud and excited! Hope everyone reading this is doing well. It gets easier and you can do it!!

My last cigarette was the morning of January 4th. I'm counting Jan. 5th as my Official Start Date.

Thirty-seven days without a smoke...I started when I was 15, I'm 37 now...For the last 10 years or so I smoked about a pack every 2 - 3 days unless I was drunk or socializing... then I chain-smoked. Sometimes 2 packs/night. 

No e-cigs, no patches.... I quit cold fucking turkey, and nobody is dead or maimed!!

Relapsed after 10 months. Feeling MAD!

So, yeah, after 10 months free I had a pretty rough spell and ended up falling off the wagon. It's been like 2 months now of smoking again - less than I did before but still. I'm so mad at myself. Things aren't awesome at the moment which I'm using as an excuse to justify smoking again but I know I need to kick this again. It's not worth dying over!

Quitting Smoking while on ADHD Meds

I'm 21 and have been smoking since I was 18. I've also been on the ADHD medication Vyvanse for just as long. This medication always triggers my desire to smoke. On the few days I don't take Vyvanse (usually between prescriptions) I cut down from half a pack+ a day to maybe 2-3 a day.

I started the 21mg patch 9 days ago and it's helped curb the severe cravings, but the psychological need is still very strong. 

The health benefits have been intense. Being able to smell things I haven't been able to smell in years brings back a lot of memories and emotions! I can also breathe again and my skin looks better.

Anyone else have experiences with smoking while on stimulant medication? How have you tried to quit while on them?

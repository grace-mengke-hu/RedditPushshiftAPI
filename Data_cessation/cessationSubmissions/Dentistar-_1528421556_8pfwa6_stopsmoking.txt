Yes! So many strong and beautiful people here. I feel so inspired.

Just saw this subreddit for the first time. I am so inspired by your posts and comments! Smoking since 2007.. Been trying to quit in the last 8 months, but I kept failing which is disappointing really. I am quitting now, made my decision.. any advice or a suggestion would be great! Thank you all!

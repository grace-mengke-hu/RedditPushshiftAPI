Can it really be this easy?

Quitting has been seamless for me...too seamless. 

I didn't have many withdrawal symptoms and far less cravings after the first couple days. I'm used to my extremely new routine, which does not involve multiple drives per day to get my nicotine fix. I'm missing the act of smoking far less, and I have zero desire to actually go out and smoke. I'm feeling like I can stick with this long term. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Do you eventually hit a wall of really needing to smoke, or any desires to lapse further down the road? I know everyone's quitting experience is different, but being a smoker for 3 years (with a few small quitting stints during that time) and suddenly being "okay" is sitting funny with me. I was able to pass 3 big "tests" of my commitment (long drives, which were a HUGE smoking trigger for me) with ease as well within the first week. Generally a 30 minute drive, or an hour and a half drive (like the ones I did recently), would be full of smoking. I was able to get through all of them with ease, and without caving in. It's confusing me that I went from smoking so much, to stopping cold turkey and getting through everything with ease.

I know this is a really weird thing to "complain" about, and I should be grateful. I absolutely am. I'm just worried that I'm so committed and motivated now, and things are going to become more difficult later on. I feel like I need to prepare.

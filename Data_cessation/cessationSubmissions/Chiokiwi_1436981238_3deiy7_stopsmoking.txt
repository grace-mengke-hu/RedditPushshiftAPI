Ridding the smell - while my mom is out of town she has asked me to remove all the evidence

Hi All!

So my mom went out of the country for two weeks and while she is overseas she decided it would be a good time to quit smoking. She has asked me to rid her house of the evidence of her many years of smoking and I want to make sure I think of everything.

Obviously I'm cleaning and hiding all ashtrays, washing down the smoking area outside where she smoked, cleaning and detailing her car (her other big smoking area) but what else should I look out for? What else should I clean? Any advice would be awesome.

Thanks!

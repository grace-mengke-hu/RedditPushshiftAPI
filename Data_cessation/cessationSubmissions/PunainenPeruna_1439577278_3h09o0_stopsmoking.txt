Mental breakdown : Day 4

Soon is day 4 over . 
I don't really miss smoking at all but I sleep so damn poorly . These 3 first days has been great . I have worked out, slept kinda okay but I had a lot of extra energy to deal with . I have enjoyed small things in life like feeling fresh and reading a book and been outside walking . But today has been horrible , I've felt so down for no particular reason, I cried so much that I had to puke .. Gross . 
I don't know what is going on .. And now I have really swollen eyes and feel sick .. 
Hope tomorrow is a better day..

How is quitting smoking working for you ?

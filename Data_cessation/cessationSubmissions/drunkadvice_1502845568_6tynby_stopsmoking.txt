Need to let out some frustrations!

TLDR:  Ranting about spouse.  Need to vent.

My wife and I quit smoking Last Friday.  Although we quit together, she decided ahead of time that she was going to quit for her.  It was up to me if I quit with her. 
 I've actually been fine, this is my 3rd or 4th time going through the withdrawals.  Keeping myself distracted with walks, and random mindlessness.  Trying to ride the waves of cravings that come and go.  I want to continue to stay strong.

But my wife, oh man...  I love her, and please forgive me if she ever reads this.  She is um, unpleasant to be around.  She slips into emotional bouts, crying, depressed, angry, bonefide panic attacks (worthy of xanex), and *constantly* lamenting about how the only thing that will solve her problems is a cigarette.  I swear every 3rd sentence is about how much she regrets deciding to quit.  Earlier she said she was jealous of smokers who had given up and just accepted the fact they were smokers and destined to smoke forever.

I'm sympathetic to having the crazies.  I'm going through my own withdrawals.  I want to be supportive, and do things that will help get her through.  Based on past experience, it will be months and she will still be off balance.

We have both read the Easy Way (although it's been a few years).  I try to get her to talk through the stress and find out why something is stressing her out.  But I'm running out of things to say that are not "GO TO THE STORE AND STOP BITCHING!"

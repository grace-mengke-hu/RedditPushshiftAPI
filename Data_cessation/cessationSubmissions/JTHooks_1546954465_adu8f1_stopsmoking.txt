2 Weeks and I feel like poop

It will be two weeks tonight. The first week wasn't really bad, I just wanted to eat all the time. Gave into that and just keep chopping vegetables and sticking them in my mouth. Problem solved. This week though I'm climbing the walls. On the one hand, I'm just like 'meh' ... I really don't need the smoke. On the other hand, I literally want to put my fingernails on the wall and dig into it. And then bang my head on it. And then punch it. Then kick it. To top it off I feel like poop. I can't breath easy at all, my throat feels like a corse grinder has been dragged over it and I'm pretty much ready to blame the entire world for every wrong that has been done to me and everyone else. Sometimes I get dizzy or it feels like the pressure dropped. Is this normal? (When) does this 'sick' go away?  I don't have a cold, doesn't feel like a bug. But I certainly feel like poop. What have folks experience with this?

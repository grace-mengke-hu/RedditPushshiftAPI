Have to quit smoking, yet again

Started smoking at age 18 for no other reason than I could. Worst decision of my life, and I've made plenty of terrible ones. I'm now 34 and smoke almost two packs a day. I've "quit" twice in the past; once for 14 months, and again for three years, both times cold turkey. Hoping to actually *quit* this time around. Any long term quitters have some advice on how to stay quit?  I don't even enjoy it anymore, and am now smoking out of just habit ("oop dumped the trash, better smoke" for example). 



I'm not around other smokers (I live alone), I don't drink, so no bar scene triggers. What's a good phone app you all would recommend?

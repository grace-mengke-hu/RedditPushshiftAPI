Physical pain is what made me quit....

I've been smoking since I was 14 (21 presently), and have been partying ever since. The past two years after waking up from binge drinking and smoking my lungs would hurt. At least my back, where I think the lungs are located hurt. I would be short of breath after smoking anything (weed or cigs), and would only smoke things after being drunk.

Anyway, I've been about three weeks without inhaling anything, and while I still do get random moments of short breath, life is better.

 I've been on a few 2 mile runs, and while they were intense, they were worth it. After the runs I would wheeze pretty hard and find it VERY difficult to catch my breath, but I think things will get better, and I'm just hoping I didn't prematurely and permanently kill my lung function at age 21.

Has anyone quit because of the physical pain?

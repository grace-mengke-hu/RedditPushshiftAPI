Hey fellow non smokers,

I just started my journey about a week ago, but i've had a dilemma, i'm a regular pot smoker and I live in spain so I used to roll weed with tobacco but i'm only smoking 'greens' as we call them here. Is it super bad if I do a couple of hits from a joint that has tobacco in it? Will getting rid of this shitty habit get much more difficult? Thanks for reading i just want to hear what you guys have to say:)

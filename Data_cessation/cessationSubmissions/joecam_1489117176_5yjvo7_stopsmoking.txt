Just another reason to stop smoking.

I stopped smoking 29yr ago, I'm 69yr now, and I didn't know how much I stunk until somebody who still smokes came near me. Now I feel embarrassed  that I stunk so bad even though it was 29yr ago. But, in those days everybody pretty much smoked, but still the people that didn't smoke had to endure it. I remember lying to  girlfriends that I didn't smoke and they said they can smell it on me.

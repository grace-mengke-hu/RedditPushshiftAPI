Not smoking's awesome!

Been almost 3 days and I feel awesome. I noticed a bit more stamina today while climbing stairs and I feel way more energetic. It's like i had a coffee when I woke up but it didn't make me sick. I feel great and my clothes stink. 

Friend of mine lit up and the smoke almost made me choke(was drinking Fanta) , I was like "Fuck yeah, no cigarettes!" right after. I can't wait till i get all that shit out from me. I started coughing really badly but I cough with a smile. I started working out since i'm bursting with energy. I'm 3-4 days away from jogging and I hate that shit. 

I also got  drunk and while drinking and recovering the next day I used the most. Had 2-3 urges which lasted a few seconds. If I can last for a stressfull day coupled with drinking I can last for life.

PS: Everything smells awful. I could do without the smell.

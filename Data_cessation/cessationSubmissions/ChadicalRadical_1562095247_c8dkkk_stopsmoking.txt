Using the patch to quit vaping?

I started my addiction with cigarettes like most people, but switched to juul for a healthier alternative. Juuling just made me more dependent on nicotine so since then I switched to a box mod and I’m currently trying to quit that.

I bought some patches today to hopefully make it a bit easier on myself and was wondering if anybody else had any luck with this method. 

Most of the stuff I see online doesn’t have much info for what I’m trying to do. All I really see are articles telling me to switch from cigs to vape, but none for vape to the patch.

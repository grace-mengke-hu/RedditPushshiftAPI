Relapsed after 22 days.

A few days ago I relapsed and ended up smoking 3 packs in the few days since. I plan on getting back on the wagon again starting tomorrow, because I find it a lot easier to do when busy with school. The initial 3 days are the only hard part really, I know once I get past that then I am in the clear again. 
Thank you guys a lot, without you this would be much more difficult

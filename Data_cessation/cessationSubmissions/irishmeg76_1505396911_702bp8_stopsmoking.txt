That moment when you realize you're extra bitchy and it may have to do with quitting. I'm 23 days in and having a rough week. I don't want to smoke. Not even a little bit. But, there's a very good chance I'm going to punch someone in the face before tomorrow. 

Maybe I need to get more exercise? Anyone else deal with wicked bad mood this far into the first month? What helped? Because prison time is not in my 5 yr plan.

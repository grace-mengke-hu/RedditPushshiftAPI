Can you guys hold me a seat?

I am not new into this "challenge" but I didn't find the motivation to do it, now I have all the things I need to get going on, on a long streak like forever, the tools are: no money, poverty and sick of getting the smell and the yellow fingers/nails, I am also into nofap and if I will start to quit gaming then I will be free for this bad habits.
If you are willing to give me some advices and on what should I expect when it is worst then I will be very thankful to you guys, also I heard the first 3 days are the worst(this is a word from my place).
Sorry for my bad engrish!

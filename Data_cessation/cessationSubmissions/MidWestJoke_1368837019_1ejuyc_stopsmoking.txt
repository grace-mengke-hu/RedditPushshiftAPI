It's been almost a whole day.

I smoked my last cigarette last night/this morning at 3am. While I am so excited to stop and begin my quest to be healthy, I can't help but want to eat, not because I'm hungry but because I'm bored and need to do something with my hands. So I need to ask, what do you do to keep your hands busy after you quit?

Quit smoking last week because of tar in phlegm from my lungs and have since been feeling very sick and flu like

After years of smoking 6 to 7 cigarettes a day, I finally decided to quit after my phlegm started showing black specks. I realized that it is the tar coated in my body and online it said I really needed to quit before I did serious damage. It's been a week now and ive been feeling so tired and sick I have flu like symptoms, a sore throat and a common cold. This happened to me once when I quit many years ago I had a cold for weeks straight. Has it happened to you? how do I recover better?

ONE MONTH! I also rewarded myself with money saved

BOOM! One month! How does it feel my new year non smokers? Pretty damn good huh?

I rarely think about smoking these days. Once in a great while. I had some wine this weekend, so it's great. I am still staying away from my friends that smoke. I do have a little get together with my buddy this coming weekend. Kind of a dudes night out thing, but he doesn't smoke, so I am safe.

I rewarded myself with a purchase with the money I saved this month ( $150). I bought PowerBeats 2 Wireless headphones. I was at the gym today and finally got fedup when I snagged the cable of my iPhone headphones with my hand while running. So right after, I went to Walmart and bought a pair! For those of you who don't know, Walmart will price match Amazon! The headphones were $179 at the store, but they matched the $144 Amazon price. 

Pretty good day today, if I have to say so myself. I had a great workout. Treadmill feels better and better these days!

Keep going you sexy non smokers you!

Nicotine withdrawal and exercise?

Been an avid nicotine user (dip/snus/gums) for about 10 years. Heaviest usage the past 2 years or so, about a can every 2 days of General Snus (8mg). I decided to quit last week, cold turkey, for multiple reasons. It has been 8 days since my last "hit" of nic.

My main exercise is swimming (about 10-15k a week) but I also lift twice a week, do yoga, and running. When I was dipping I could exercise 10-12 hours a week, no problem. Last week was a struggle just to wake up and get to the pool to swim and when I did I felt like I was swimming through jello the whole workout, it was awful, I couldn't push myself at all.

One of the main reasons I quit was so I could swim faster and push myself more but it seems that quitting has had the opposite effect so far, is this normal with nicotine withdrawal?

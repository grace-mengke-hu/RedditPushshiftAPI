Experiences of a serial quitter

I'd been smoking for close to 9 years when I quit and smoked close 7-8 sticks a day. My main motivations were health and freedom. Freedom from this constant worry about where and when I'm going to my next hit, freedom of guilt esp., when my 18 month old son would run to hug me when I got home. It really bugged that something so sick had such a strong control over my thoughts and actions.

I've been trying to quit for the last 2 years now, the aim was to get off nicotine completely. The longest I'd gone was for a fortnight a couple of times. Things were getting desperate. I read Allen Carr and it's definitely a brilliant book but it didn't have the kind of effect that it seems to have on some other quitters here. I'd tried the hypnosis, gum and e-cig, didn't work either.

I used to decide every Sunday night that I would quit psych myself up, read a lot of stuff. These mini-quits would sometimes last for a few hours to a couple of days. So, I guess, something had to finally give and something just felt different on Sept 1st, 2013. I knew this would be the last time, haven't smoked since - no nicotine, no single puff.

Some of the things that worked for me
- Allen Carr - without doubt a fantastic mythbuster, although was not my Messaiah. That could also be because it took me a long time for me to internalise what he was saying. So keep re-reading the book
- Meditation - Just being concious of your craving, of your thoughts. Helped me a great deal to let the feelings pass over
- Reading - reading helped me gather a good deal of knowledge about addiction and tips to fight cravings
- This sub - and especially the experiences of other quitters. So, sharing my experience after reading and being inspired by the many quitters before me is a big deal for me :)
- I'm an ex-smoker and not a non-smoker. This reminds of the struggle I went through and the pain during the initial days of the quit
- Big test early on - I went to a party with 3 other smokers, the first week of my quit, who kept chain smoking all through the evening and I didn't take a puff. This gave me a lot of confidence early on
- [This link](http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/cravingsandurges/a/Four-Steps-To-Defeat-The-Urge-To-Smoke.htm) I'd posted here eariler about how to deal with cravings  was great 

The greatest benefits for me
- Energy - both physical and mental. You'll be amazed how much clearer you can think when there is nothing eating away at you
- No guilt - The joy of hugging my son as soon as I get back makes it all worth it
- Boners - Phew! It just feels so good now
- And of course, time and money

I would urge more and more people to share their experiences here, it inspired me and I'm sure it'll help others!

Keep up the good work guys!

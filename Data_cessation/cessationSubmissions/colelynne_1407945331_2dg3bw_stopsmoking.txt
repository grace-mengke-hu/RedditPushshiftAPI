If I want to try the Easyway, do I need to smoke through it if I've already "quit?"

I started out with patches but have realized that I'm still spending money and potentially prolonging my dependence, and should maybe try non-nicotine methods prior to relying on NR through the duration of my quit. 

I watched the video already (which I did find helpful) but would like to try the book as well.

Since the book says to follow all the instructions, and one of them is to smoke while reading the book - am I missing something by reading it without them?

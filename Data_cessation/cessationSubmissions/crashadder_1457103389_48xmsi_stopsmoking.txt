watch out !

I cant remember the last time i thought about smoking or had any sort of urge to smoke .hell i dont even check my badge anymore. I thought it was over. boy was i wrong. I am about to make the biggest decision of my life and relocate to another country for an amazing job opportunity. the only problem with that is my wife and my son cant join me . So we've decided that i would go alone but visit home every 2 weeks for about 2 years then come back home with a better experience on my resume. If i say no now chances are that i will bang my head against the wall the first time i have problems with my current job as this is a once in a life time opportunity. long story short all i can think of right now is how wonderful it'd be  to get back into smoking when i live alone in that country. Its not even that infamous "just one wont hurt" bullshit . I actually think about getting back to it full time. I cant picture myself living alone not smoking. guys and gals of this sub. please be careful. you never know what life brings. how much you stay quit doesnt really determine your success but its your mentality that does.

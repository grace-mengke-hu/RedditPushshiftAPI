I posted here 3 days ago. I never thought that i would be actually doing this.

It's so much easier than i expected. SO MUCH.

I don't even think about it at this point. I even forgot i was smoking. There were 2 times i thought about it on the first and second day. The one i had a small fight with my gf and i thought i wanted to have one to chill, but then i forgot about it. And the second time was when i was driving because i like smoking while driving. It was a habit i liked.

Anyway 3 days clean now. I feel free. i really do. I am getting better and better at practice (i started Muay Thai classes a couple of weeks ago) and life is good! 

The only thing i can complain is that i can't save the money i would have used to buy smokes. I just use it to eat more food.
It's great that my body doesn't gain any weight no matter what i eat though. I've been skinny all my life.

Anyway, i just wanted to share my thoughts and give hope to anyone thinking of quitting.

It's not as hard as i thought it would be. Go for it!

edit: fixed some words!

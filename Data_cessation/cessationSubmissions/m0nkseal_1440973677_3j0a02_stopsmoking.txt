A little factoid from Veritasium that opened my eyes

Microsieverts is a unit for measuring radiation

For reference: Eating a banana gives you 0.1 microsieverts worth of radiation 

- On average a human being receives 2000 microsieverts of radiation per year which is pretty inconsequential.

- In a CT scan, a person receives 7000 microsieverts of radiation which is 3 years worth of natural background radiation.

- People living around Fukushima will receive 10000 microsieverts of radiation per year.

- US Radiation workers receive 50,000 microsieverts of radiation per year

- Astronauts on the space station receive 80,000 microsieverts worth of radiation in a span of 6 months 

Can you guess who receives the highest radiation?

- An average smokers lungs receive 160,000 microsieverts of radiation per year from the Polonium-210 and Lead-210 present in cigarettes.

This fact just caught me unawares and it definitely helps with the quitting.

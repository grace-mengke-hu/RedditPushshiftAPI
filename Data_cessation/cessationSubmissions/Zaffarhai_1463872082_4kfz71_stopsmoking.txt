So sick of/from smoking

Through the first 24 hours. Sick as a dog, which is really reinforcing my resolve to quit. The rest of the family is getting better from this cold, but I am still coughing like hell and sore from the efforts.  

I'm using the patch, so few few cravings. Lots of physical/emotional cues I am getting past (eating, walking outside, a fight with the SO). 

I am so god damned sick of smoking. I hate being a smoker. I need this quit to be THE quit. Any advice is appreciated.

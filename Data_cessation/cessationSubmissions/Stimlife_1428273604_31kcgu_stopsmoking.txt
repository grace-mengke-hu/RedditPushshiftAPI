I've been smoke free for a couple of days now and I'm getting some odd symptoms...

My hands are really tingly and even slightly painful sometimes. I also feel dizzy; and when I go number 2 it really stinks. My abdomen kinda hurts and if got some acid reflux? This is hell guys please tell me it ends soon :(

And how do I get the badge saying how long I've abstained from smoking? I think seeing that everyday would help me stop for good!

Nearly there

Halfway through my first day. Video games and my mum helping me to pull through. Nothing is quite satisfying me, but at the same time, I am so happy with what I am doing. I have been reading loads of stories on here and they are really helping, so thanks a lot to this community. Here is to the first day!

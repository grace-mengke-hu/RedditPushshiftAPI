I just started quitting 5 minutes ago. Any tips to not give into the desire if it comes up again?

I've tried quitting a year ago, bubblegum with nikotin didn't do much for me. It's more the psychological aspect that's triggering me.

I'd be grateful for any advice. What helped you avoiding the desire?

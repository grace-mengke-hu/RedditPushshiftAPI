Hangover without a sore throat

Yesterday I went out, got really drunk and didn't smoke. I was really tempted the whole night but gladly my non-smoking friend distracted me each time. 

I realized today that this is the situation where I failed in most of my attempts. I avoided drinking and partying for weeks and built up the fear that I will fail in this situation and it became a Self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Yesterday was spontaneous, I wasn't nervous and I had a good time.

Had a good start, and suddenly failed. Need some good advice

After 15 years of smoking a pack a day, I finally decided to quit. 
The first 10 days was easy, but on day 11 I fell for the old "just one more can't hurt". Oh, how wrong I was! This was a week ago, and I've been smoking about half a pack a day since. Now I can't stop making excuses to delay quitting and just buy one more pack. 
I seem to lack the determination I had 17 days ago. How can I get it back, if possible?

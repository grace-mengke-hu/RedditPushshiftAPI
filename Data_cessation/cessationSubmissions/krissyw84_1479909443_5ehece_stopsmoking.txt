Just quit today!

Decided to quit. I really want this. I feel the hardest part will be not smoking at work especially on slow days. Have to find a way to get through it. I have 5 days off so I figured quitting during this time would be better so when I go back to work maybe it won't be so hard. I will gladly take any advice that will help me!

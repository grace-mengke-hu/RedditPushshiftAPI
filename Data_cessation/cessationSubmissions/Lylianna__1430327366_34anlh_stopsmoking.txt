I quit smoking on the 26th.. but I want nothing more than to leave my office and buy a pack right now.

I quit on Sunday.. I'm turning 23 on the 7th and I've been smoking since I was 12 (French Canadian thing). One bad thing I did though was have a smoke every morning on my way to work.. except today. I am seriously super close to going out and buying a pack right now. My willpower is shit. What can I do?

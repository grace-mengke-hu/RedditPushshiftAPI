Trying to make a list of things to do instead of smoking...

Hi guys, 

I'm on day 6 here and it's still insanely hard! 

I'm trying to come up with a list of (healthy/not eating) things to do with my hands and time instead of smoking.

So far I've got:
Excercise, Dishes/washing, Jigsaw puzzles, Message friends, Browse reddit.

Any other suggestions?
Thanks in advance

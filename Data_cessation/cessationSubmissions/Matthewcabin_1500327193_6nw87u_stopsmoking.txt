Back to trying to quit again.

Here I am again, trying to quit. 

I quit cold turkey on Thursday night 07/13, and made it until about 10 minutes ago. I'm really bummed that I couldn't last any longer, but I am not giving up entirely.

I am really disappointed in myself though.

I mostly wanted to just put my thoughts out here, so I'm not expecting any responses.

I have smoked for about 16 years. I've quit a number of times, the longest being 3 months or so. I have tried patches and hated them passionately. 

I want to be done with this, I have made the decision to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring but I don't want to give it to her smelling like smoke, or (hopefully) walking down the aisle wanting a cigarette.

My Aunt passed away recently from lung cancer and my grandmother on my Dad's side has cancer in both of her lungs. Almost all of my relatives, including my parents have smoked, so I am at odds with my genetics.

I can manage not smoking when I am away from work, but I have a desk job and that is where I am the most at odds. The boredom of tapping away at a computer for 8 hours a day makes it very difficult for me to quit. Which is ultimately what made me sneak away just now and run to the store to buy a pack.

My 31st birthday is a month from now and I hope I can spend it doing something other than smoking or laboring over trying to quit.

Sorry my post was a bit of a ramble. I hope to be a little more active in this sub now that I am trying to quit again; so, hello everyone!

Edit: yikes, I guess I need to reset my badge :(

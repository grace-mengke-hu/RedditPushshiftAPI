Day 2. Vapes are the worst

Just quit yesterday. 

3I've had a vape but never used it due to the fact that I couldn't stand the taste of it, i never enjoyed it at all. I finally decided to quit as I saw my smoking skyrocket due to school and work related stress. I picked up some juice, and ironically, the reason the vape is working for me is: Everytime I see a friend smoking, I'd want a smoke. Now I take a hit or two off my vape and the shitty ass taste of it makes me want to puke and I don't want a cig or any more hits off my vape. It's stupid but somehow has been working. It allows me to still take "smoke breaks" at work, but I take a puff of my vape and end up just sitting outside enjoying the day. I can get used to this lifestyle, and have no plans of going back. 

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to share my unorthodox vape experience!!

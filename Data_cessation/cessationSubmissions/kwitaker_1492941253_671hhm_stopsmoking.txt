One month without smoking, 3 days off the patch

Well I made it a month without smoking and after today I will be 3 days without any nicotine whatsoever through the patch.

The first week was the hardest but everyday has been getting easier and easier.  The one thing that has saved me are pounds and pounds of pistachios.

Where do I even start?

I want to quit but I honestly have no clue how I'm going to. Cigarettes and pipe tobacco are so cheap compared to vaping, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, etc. And I really don't see myself chewing regular gum to help the physical aspect. Please help, if you can. I'll reply when I can as I work 3rd shift and I'm either working or sleeping.

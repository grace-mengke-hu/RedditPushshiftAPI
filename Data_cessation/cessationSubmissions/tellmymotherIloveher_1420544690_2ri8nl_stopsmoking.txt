Just for Today

Hey there, long time Reddit lurker, first time poster. Quitting smoking. Yikes. I smoked my last one at 22:31 on 31/12/2014 having made a promise to myself to finish the Duty Free and read Alan Carr. I’ve tried in the past but didn't want to do it for me, more to appease my mother, my doctor, my ex. This time I’m doing it for me. Nicotine addiction (for that is what we are dealing with here) is proving a struggle to get over but it means a lot to have fellowship on this journey and to know there are other people going through the same as me. I guess my only advice is to keep it in the day and just get to bed without a cigarette/nicotine. There are things we can do just for today that would scare us if we said we were doing them for life. Everything else will follow, as sure as the sun rises. Good luck folks and keep up the good work one day at a time.

Feeling the allure of smoking, 6 months removed

Well, damn, I'm starting to feel the allure of cigarettes again. The wanting to consume, just that feeling of inhalation. And the comfort of a nicotine buzz.

I know the true reasons I quit: the embarrassment of always leaving to smoke (like less than every 30 minutes, I'd step outside to smoke), literally reeking of tobacco, the constant slow drain on my bank account, needing to always have cigarettes on me, all of those serious inconveniences, NOT to mention the health effects.

It just sucks. Quitting in the early going felt easier in a way, because those negatives were fresh. Now, I feel like the positives and nostalgia are gaining force.

Either way, I haven't smoked. I hope I don't. I know it would be very soon to being back to a pack/day+. It felt good to vent here and now the problem doesn't seem as dire after finishing this post. Thanks in advance for any replies and best wishes.

Anyone ever had a cigarette in their dreams?

Been 4 and half years since I quit. I had a couple of dreams lately where I had a cigarette and the sensation felt very real. It triggered a craving I haven't felt in a very long time, but thankfully I quickly shook it off. Just a fair warning quitters, the cravings can still come and go.

Good luck with your battles. I'm always rooting for you.

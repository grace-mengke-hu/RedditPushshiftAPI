It’s my birthday and I quit!

A very good occasion to do so right ? :p
Fed up with having a bad breath, dry mouth, having this aweful grey complexion...and so on...
So there! That’s it. It seems like a pretty dream now until à cravings comes...i’ve tried millions of times, everyday, but the evening always messes with me...any tips for that? Why the evening? 
You people seem to be so glad to have quit and always speak of how great live is without cigarettes, I want that. Only breaking a 11 year old habit seems pretty hard...
Any opinion is so much appreciated !

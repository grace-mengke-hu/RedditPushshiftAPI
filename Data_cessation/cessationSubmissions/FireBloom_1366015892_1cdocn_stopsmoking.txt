Something that might help

I've been a "I'm quitting today, after this pack" person for about the last two years, not even when using nic patches could I keep my demons at bay for more than a few hours. It's affected multiple areas of my mental health. But, I believe I've found something that really works for me. 

Along with low dose nic patches, I told myself "I'm going to put my mental state back to before I smoked".  So for the last week I've been listening to music I was obsessed with when I was 13 (LotR Ost and Celtic music, cause I was an awesome 13 yr old), laying around all day reading, and watching inspiring movies from that time; you get the gist. I began smoking around 14 or 15, under the guise of social acceptance. Submerging my consciousness in what remains to be the happiest moments in my life. 

 Ultimately the thought keeps popping in my head that I did these things for days on end and never needed to pause a movie to go outside, or go out to a park and explore without a cancer stick propped between my lips, with the smoke stinging my eyes. These happy memories have been slowly replacing my constant thought cycle of rationalization and guilt. 

Thus, my cravings have decreased as well; before I even started up the patches again. Media is such an integral piece to our lives these days that it can, and should be, made a tool to self improvement. 

That being said, I refuse to start reading Lord of the Rings fan fiction again. 

Stay strong guys and gals.  Your mind is not linear and your health is not irreparable, but life is short and your happiness cannot wait another day.

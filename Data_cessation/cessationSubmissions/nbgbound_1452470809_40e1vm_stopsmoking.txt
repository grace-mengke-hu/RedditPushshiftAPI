7 Days Smoke Free, It feels so Gooood!

I wanna thank you people in this subreddit for the support and encouragement.
 I quit a week ago, day 1 was manageable, day 2 was hell, frustrating, and almost relapsed then. The third day, I felt sick, nausea and vomiting , I actually got dizzy and fainted in my bathroom and spent the whole day resting and sleeping. Drinking water, some green tea and crackers helped ease the nausea. That rest throughout the day was a blessing, as I woke up during my fourth day feeling active and better and since then I haven't felt any withdrawal symptoms, maybe few cravings but they are so mild that I easily ignored them. I never felt better, healthier or happier than now, and thats only after 1 week of quitting after 7 years of smoking a pack a day. I never thought its this easy. I know I ain't going back.

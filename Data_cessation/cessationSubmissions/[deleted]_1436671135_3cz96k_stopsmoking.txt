just had my last cigarette, i only smoke when i drink anyone else only smoke when they drink?

been smoking on and off for the last 10 years the last five i only smoke when i drink alcohol.. ive quit drinking for months so i can quit smoking but when i have a beer i have an overwhelming urge to smoke.. is it possible to enjoy an alcoholic beverage without wanting a cigarette?

The Unsatisfactoriness of Smoking

Earlier today I was doing my usual run to 7-11. The entire walk there, I was thinking, "I don't want to do this. I don't want more cigarettes. I don't want to spend the money."

So just before getting there, I told myself to try turning around and walking back home empty-handed. So I did. And I immediately regretted the decision. "No, I don't really want to turn around!" I thought, "I do want those cigarettes!"

And then it clicked.

Regardless of which choice I made, I would be left unsatisfied. If I smoked, I would be unsatisfied. If I did not smoke, I would be--and am--unsatisfied.

I figure, if I am going to be unsatisfied no matter what, I may as well be unsatisfied in a way that leaves me with a fuller wallet and clearer lungs.

Thank you for reading.

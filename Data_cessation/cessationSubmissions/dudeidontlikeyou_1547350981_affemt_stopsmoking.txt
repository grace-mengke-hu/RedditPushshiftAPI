So this happened

I've been a smoker for 3 years (i know its not that long) but i recently decided to quit and go cold turkey, i honestly have to say, staring at a more than half full pack of cigarettes and wrapping duct tape around it and stomping on it a shit tonne then burying it was one of the grestest decisions i have ever made and i honestly feel no regrets about the $30 the pack cost me (Australia). Just needed somewhere to say this

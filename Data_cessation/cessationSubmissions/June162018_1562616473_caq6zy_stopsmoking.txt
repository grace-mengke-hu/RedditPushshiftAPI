Is this a test?!

My neighbor, bless him, kindly left me the rest of his pack literally on my door step. Im assuming he decided to quit again too. Its been about 2 weeks and i think im still going strong though. Im not really interested in them but id feel mean throwing them out. This nearly full pack is taunting me

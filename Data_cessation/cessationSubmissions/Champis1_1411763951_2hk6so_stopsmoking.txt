201 Days!

Yay! 201 days you guys.

Something I never thought i'd stop doing in my life, was smoking. I'm 23 and smoked for 7 years. The month before I quit I was smoking over a pack a day of the cheapest cig's I could get my hands on. My wife smoked too. It was bad.

Then we both got Noro. (SP?) The virus that makes you crap and vomit uncontrollably for at least 24 hours. I Couldn't STAND the smell of cigarettes when I was sick. I tried smoking once when I was sick and I vomited 5 minutes later.

It wasn't even the puking that got me to stop. I told myself, if I couldn't even bare throwing up and going to the bathroom constantly for 24 hours, how would cancer feel like? How would chemo feel like? I was done. I quit then and there. One week later my wife quit. 

Smells. Taste. Everything, I couldn't BELIEVE how much I was missing out on. How I told myself differently all those years. We got a new house, moved in. And realized all our clothes just wreaked of cigarettes. That's what I smelt like all the time. Wow.

My app says I've saved over a thousand dollars, but I was planning a wedding the entire time so... that didn't happen. Lol. I Feel great. Healthy. This is life now.

EDIT: - To anyone that is just now quitting. To me the first 2-3 weeks were the toughest.  Craving all the time, not knowing what to do with myself, that sorta thing. I just kept myself busy all the time. Played more video games, worked on the house, yard work, literally anything to keep my mind off of smoking. Now I can't even imagine smoking again. I can't stand the smell, when I see people on TV smoking I have no feelings to try it. I've been to a few bars since and it just made me sick. Just stick with it, it truly does get easier, and it's completely worth it.

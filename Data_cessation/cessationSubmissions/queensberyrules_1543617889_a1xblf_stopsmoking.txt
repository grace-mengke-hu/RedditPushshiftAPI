ONE MONTH!... is my badge working?

I am very proud of myself. I was hoping to log on today to this sub and be greeted with a 1 month star badge. Instead, It's stuck on 3 week star badge at 27 days. Weird. I know it isn't everything but it's one of the things that keeps me going. Well, keep going folks!

Thank you Wisdom tooth!

I got a wisdom tooth removed about, well, 12 days ago. It was my 3rd operation to get all 4 removed due to complications and officially my last. On my 2nd operation I smoked through the healing and induced a dry socket infection which SUUUUUCCCKKKEED so bad that I gave up an 8 year pack a day addiction for it.

I do feel like I cheated because I had a whole week off work to be jacked up on vico to kick my addiction...but it worked!

Haha finally.

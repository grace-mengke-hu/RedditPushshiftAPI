Reasons why we try

In an age where the [Mars Colonial Transporter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Colonial_Transporter) is an actual project by SpaceX, the last thing I want to do is jeopardize my health. 

I don't know about you but I want to live as long as possible and see many more incredible achievements of humanity.

Just another "out there" reason to quit and keep it that way. Feel free to post your own weird reasons :)

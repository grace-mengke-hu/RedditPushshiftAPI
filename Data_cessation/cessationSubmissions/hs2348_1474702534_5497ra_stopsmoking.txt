I can feel that all of you will quit smoking.

It's been only few weeks for me. I've smoked for 6 years, half pack a day. I think I tried to quit for over 20-30 times before I finally got to make it to more than a week, and still on going.

But you know what, I think you all can and will quit. I feel that and wanted to let you all know that. Good nights to you all, and wake up victorious!

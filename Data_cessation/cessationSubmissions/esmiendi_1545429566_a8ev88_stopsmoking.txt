Guys, I fucking did it!

When I started out I kinda had 4 weeks in my mind as some sort of magic number, like if I made it to 4 weeks something would change. Turns out magic numbers are dumb but today is 4 weeks since my last cigarette!

Not gonna lie though, I'm pretty drunk right now and if I had cigs in the house I'd probably be smoking. Still, one month ago I'd be heading out to buy some so this is progress. If nothing else I've gotta last past new years so I can tell the co-workers who told me I'd mess up over the holidays to go fuck themselves.

Here's to a smoke free 2019 everyone!

Day 3...

So, today's day three smoke and nicotine free. I'm taking Chantix and it's doing its job. I can't say the cravings are completely gone. But, they are far far easier to handle. And there's almost no anxiety.

I started having the dreams. They say you'll have odd dreams on Chantix. For me, they seem quite pleasurable, actually. Some are erotic... so, that's nice ;) Very vivid.

Another dream I had was about letting down my friends. They know that I'm quitting. I told almost all of my friends. I haven't told my family because they all smoke and I'm afraid they'll sabotage it. But, I am the type of person that does better if he's held accountable. So, I couldn't do this in secret either.

Anyway, day 3 and counting. Going to spend some time outdoors today and enjoy the beautiful weather. Might try and make my way to a park or something.

Take care.

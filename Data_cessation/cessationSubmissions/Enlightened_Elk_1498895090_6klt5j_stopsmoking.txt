19 year old- nicotine addiction for 5 years

So, a little backstory. I'm a 19 year old college student currently studying in China. I've been heavily addicted to all nicotine products (Chewing tobacco, cigs, and e-cigs) since I was introduced to chew when I was 14. I HATE my addiction, but humans have this incredible power of justifying things, dangerous or not.  "Oh I'll only use until I find a nice girl" "This isn't a problem for me" etc etc. Well, so i'm studying in China, and cigs here are dirt cheap, like USD 1-3$ a pack. That was my current justification, I actually said it to my roommate when asked why I smoke. "Oh they're so cheap here, I have to". Well, i'm all alone in my hotel room and stumbled upon this subreddit, by fate or chance, i'll never know. What I do know, however, is that I just spontaneously ripped up my brand new fancy pack of cigs, and have decided this was my call to quit. I wasn't aware this subreddit existed until today, and It's exactly what I needed. Like-minded people who are taking action of their future. If anybody read this, thank you a ton, and please drop a comment if you can, I think it will help me out. Cheers

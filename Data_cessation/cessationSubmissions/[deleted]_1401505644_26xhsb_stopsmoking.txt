I started and stopped...

Hey reddit I know this probably doesn't follow the guidelines of this sub-reddit but I just needed to say this. I bought a pack of cigarettes an hour ago and smoked three of them, and I honestly can say that I will never do that again. I was being a complete jackass who decided that it would be cool to start smoking cigs because I thought it would look cool but fuck that. That isn't me and I know that isn't me so I just stopped right then and there, threw the pack away and I now have no desire anymore to do it again. The buzz was great yes but it seriously wasn't fuckin worth it. I guess I made this post to tell you guys out there that are trying to stop that it is fucking possible and you can do it. I guess I also did it to "test my limits" and well they've been tested and I will never be doing that again. Thanks for reading. 


If this does get deleted please tell me where to post this I just wanted to share this with you guys.

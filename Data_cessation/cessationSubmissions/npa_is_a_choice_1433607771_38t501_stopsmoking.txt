Ready to quit

So I quit two years ago, then started smoking like once a week at work. I realized this isn't solving anything and it will only lead me back to smoking all the time again. I don't want to go through the whole full-time smoking cessation (it's shitty), so I'm stopping now. Last  night I declined the cigarette offered to me and just hung out while my friends smoked. It was nice.
Yay to not smoking

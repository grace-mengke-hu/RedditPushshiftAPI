When does the mental fog lift?

Sorry for posting a lot the last couple days. You guys are my go-to distraction, especially at work, so I've been all over here lately.

I'm just wondering if anyone can provide insight into when the mental fog starts lifting? Tomorrow marks one week and I still feel like I'm walking around in a confused daze. Everyday tasks take a lot more intentional concentration on my part than usual, and I've noticed myself zoning out for a half hour to an hour at a time, just losing track of time doing meaningless crap like browsing Reddit and Facebook.

I'm kinda getting sick of it. I've felt super stoned for 6 days now (and I'm only smoking weed before bed, so I know that's not it!) and I'm getting kind of sick of it. I feel sort of numb to everything around me. Does this end on its own, or is it a mental hurdle I need to actively work to overcome?

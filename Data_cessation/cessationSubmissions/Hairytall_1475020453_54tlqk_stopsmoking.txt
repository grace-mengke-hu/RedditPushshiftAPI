Oh yeah, I forgot to check back with you all.

Check. Out. That.  FLAIR.   I smoked for 12 years, at least a pack a day.... and I never missed a day except maybe 1-2 in those 12 years.   A year and a half after quitting, my life is better in every single way.   I do not miss smoking at all, and I do not think about it.

I used [whyquit.com](http://whyquit.com/) to quit cold turkey.   I tried a ton of other ways to quit over the years (nicorette, vaping, hypnosis) and they all failed me immediately, so I do have to strongly recommend cold turkey with a combination of active discipline practice.    Make the decision not to be a smoker anymore, and then don't smoke.  Discipline is key, which I practiced with the [x-effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/)

Good luck!   You won't regret it!

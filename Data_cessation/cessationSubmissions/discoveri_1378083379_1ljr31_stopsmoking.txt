Went to a place which always triggers my desire to smoke

and I didn't have a single craving all day! 

Earlier today I was at our local renaissance festival, which I love to attend. Normally I would eat a ton of food, drink plenty of beer and smoke a pack of cigs. This year I ate a ton of food (it's delicious and pretty much everything tastes better on a stick), didn't drink any beer (I'm preggo) and did not have any desire to smoke. My other big news is that my husband is quitting smoking tonight!

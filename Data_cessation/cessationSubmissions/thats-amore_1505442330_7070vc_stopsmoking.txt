Trying to be a supportive girlfriend, but don't know how to help.

Sorry if this isn't the place to post this, but I just found it on my search to find something to help my boyfriend. He's trying to quit again, and I'm so proud of him but I've never been a smoker and have no idea what he's going through or how to help. He started smoking pretty young and used to work in a field where you were ridiculed for taking a break unless you were smoking. Over the past almost two years he's tried quitting multiple times, and has succeeded for weeks, even a couple months at a time. I know he can do it, I just wish I knew how to help.

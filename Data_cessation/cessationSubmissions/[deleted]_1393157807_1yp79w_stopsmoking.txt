Time to change

I've been a smoker for 16 years.. 16! how did I let it come this far? I startede young, right after my father died and I moved away from home. I had byen playing with fire before that, but never anything serious. my father died of a lung disease.. one I also have.. he died when he was 35 - nonsmoker all his life... Im now 31.. I was told I was going  to die young too, so what's the point in trying to quit.. but this state of life I have now, is not acceptable.. even if I don't have long on this earth, I would like to have some peace of mind. this is now my 700th attempt to quit (okay, more like 20), I've only got this subreddit on my front page currently (easy to find in a panik attack) and I have a plan of action. have a party every weekend for the next 3months , but I refuse to wait - there will never be a "right" time anyway. last day as a smoker! can't wait for the lungs to clear and the coughing to stop.

A week and a day

Feeling good. This is a personal milestone for me because it's the longest I've gone without a cigarette since January 2013. 

So after a year and a half of the nasty habit, I feel confident that I'm going to make it through. The voice in my head still tries to get me back into it, but deflecting the temptations is starting to become second nature now.

And so the lifelong battle continues. But when you're in the right state of mind, it's a battle easily won.

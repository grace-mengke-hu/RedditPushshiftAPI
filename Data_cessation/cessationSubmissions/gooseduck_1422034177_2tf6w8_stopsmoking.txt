Quitting Smoking 101

So I missed my 100 days, but as it's 101 days I thought I would share some things for anybody who has just quit, is thinking about quitting or anyone who has been quit for a while but has the little nagging voice inside your head trying to twist your arm into 'just one'.

**1) All cravings will pass whether you smoke or not**  
Every single nicotine craving will pass, regardless of whether you smoke. If you choose to smoke, all you do is cause the next craving whilst temporarily relieving this one. There is only one way to stop them for good. Break the chain and don't smoke.

**2) Educate yourself**  
Get all the apps, read the articles at whyquit, go through posts on here, ask questions, watch the Allen Carr video, watch it again. The most you know about nicotine addiction and the nature of it, the easier it is to detach yourself from it and to see it for what it really is.

**3)There is no such thing as one cigarette**  
Because one cigarette causes the craving for the next, there is no such thing as one cigarette. It puts you right back in the nicotine trap, and you need to muster up the resolve to quit again. If you don't believe me, look at how much relapse posts here involve them buying a pack after one! The nicotine-addicted brain will do everything to convince you that you can have 'just one' or in certain situations. Do not listen, you will not even enjoy the cigarette.

**4) You will reap the benefits sooner than you think and they will be bigger than you ever thought possible**  
This is a huge one. There are so many benefits to your quality of life that come from quitting smoking. From less severe hangovers, to food tasting amazing and rediscovering smell, better skin, better concentration as you aren't sidetracked by craving a cigarette, the knowledge that you beat smoking so you can do anything you like, more energy, better sleep, better smell, better teeth. It goes on, I didn't believe how many things improved when I quit, it astounded me how much smoking was impacting on my life, I would never have thought it whilst I was smoking.

**5) You are a non-smoker from day one**  
As soon as you have extinguished your final cigarette, you are a non-smoker. The badge tracks how long you've been a non-smoker for. You are not quitting, you have quit. Now stay that way, onwards!

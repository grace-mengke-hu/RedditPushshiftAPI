42 days - some thoughts

hey, im 23 and smoked since i was 15. i read Allan Carrs easyway to stop and quit. Ive been out clubbing twice and have refrained from smoking on both occasions, but I felt I wasnt able to 'let go' on both occasions in fear of having a smoke which I really dont want to do. 

How can I overcome this?

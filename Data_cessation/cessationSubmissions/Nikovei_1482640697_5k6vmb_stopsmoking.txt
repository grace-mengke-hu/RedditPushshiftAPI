Am I fucked or just over reacting?

Ok, so im pretty young (16) and smoked for 3 months now ( I know not long) but I realized that how stupid and harming smoking is gladly this early and i wanted to quit. I went 9 days without smoking and just yesterday smoked again. Just now I spit blood. Not like in normal saliva but if i try to get shit from my throath theres blood in it. Im not from the smartest end of the spectrum so yeah. Also before this i have not had any coughing or anything like that. Could this be just my body somehow reacting to the chemicals again? EDIT : also when i get up i get dizzy for a moment, not every time maybe like once in 10 times and this started 2 days ago i think. Another edit : For the 1st time in my life im honestly scared. Yet another edit. I just over reacted i think, no blood anymore but never the less this made me realize that i NEED to quit. I was going to quit on new years eve and fly my remaining cigs to the skys with rockets. But now i will do that to all of my cigs i have now. Today will be the day 1 of not smoking.

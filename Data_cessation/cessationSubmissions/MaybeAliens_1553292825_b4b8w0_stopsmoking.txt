Anyone have experience quitting nicotine vaping?

In 2012, I made the extremely poor decision to buy an electronic cigarette because I wanted something to smoke while drinking instead of cigarettes. 7 years later: I am very addicted to electronic cigarettes (currently using a Juul at 5% nicotine). 

I spend at least $50 on refill pods per week. I have tried getting a rig to fill it with juice, save money, and lower the nicotine level, but have been very unsatisfied with the bulkiness of these vapes, the weak throat hits from them, and the messiness of the juice, so I wind up back using pods. I find myself going to the bathroom frequently to use the vape, chain smoking it when alone, panic if I run out of pods, and cannot fathom going more than two hours without using it. Not to mention the dizziness and headaches from ingesting so much nicotine, along with the fact that there is limited research into what putting that crap into your body does. 

Has anyone had any experience quitting a serious vaping addiction? These things are meant to be used to help quit nicotine, so what is a safer option I can pursue? Cold turkey? Nicotine gum? Thanks and I appreciate you all listening.

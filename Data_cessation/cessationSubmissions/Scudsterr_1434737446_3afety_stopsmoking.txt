500 Days!

It's just getting close to a year and a half!  I quit smoking in February of 2014 and its been really great.  I smell things, I can exercise without coughing up gunk, my blood pressure and heart rate are lower now, and my anxiety is much more manageable.  The first few months were tough, it is not easy, but it is possible.  To anyone who needs the motivation, start today, you won't regret it.  I hardly think about it now and I don't get cravings anymore.  Even when I see it in movies and real life I don't really notice it.  Every day gets easier, and for some people like me it becomes essentially a non-issue.  It's hard to believe I smoked for 7 years. If you really want to stop smoking you can, it's really hard, but with determination you can do it.  Good luck!  And don't be too hard on yourself!  Just gotta keep getting back up.

Zero.Zero. Six (hours).

Smoked my last cig last night at midnight.  This is take-two of a mutual quit- my wife is quitting at the same time.  I've been smoking since I was 16, I'm now 30.

Just trying to get through today without a near-constant companion for the past decade and a half has been tough.  Fortunately, I've been in the office alone this morning...haven't had the opportunity to bite anyone's head off yet.  Unfortunately, I have to be in court for two hearings this afternoon (I'm a lawyer), so we'll see how that goes.

Just a heads-up: I expect to be bugging the hell outta y'all for tips and general ranting.  I appreciate the help in advance.

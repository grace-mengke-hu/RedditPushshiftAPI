Worse cravings after 10 days?

This happened the last time I tried to quit. I breezed through the first week or so, but the 10-day mark brought some gnarly cravings (been taking Wellbutrin, but it provided minimal help this time). I was doing patches, as well, but I haven't used those in about 5 days, and haven't seen much of a difference with/without them.

I'm not sure why it suddenly ramps up after about ten days, but there were a few times I came close to slipping up. FWIW, I still haven't, so I'm happy about that, but it ain't easy. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

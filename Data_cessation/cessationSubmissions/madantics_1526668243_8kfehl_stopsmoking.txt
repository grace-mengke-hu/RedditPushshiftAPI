Long time lurker, unsubbed a year or so back, 8 days out today from a 11-year, pack-a-day habit.

Hung around this sub for the longest time ever, trying to get to the point of quitting. Quit a few other things in the process, but nicotine just hung on. A week back, putting out the laundry with the missus, I thought aloud that I needed to quit, with a 4-year-old who wants to do everything he sees his parents do. Smoked my last that night, without knowing it was my last. Next morning, just decided not to stock up. Can't say for sure how rough it is cold turkey as I am neck deep in personal and professional issues, but the days/week has passed, and I dropped by to share this milestone with you guys. Thanks for being an ocean of encouragement.

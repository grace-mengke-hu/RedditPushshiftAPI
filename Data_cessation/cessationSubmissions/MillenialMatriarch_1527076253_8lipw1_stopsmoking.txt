Spontaneous quit 23rd hour

I talk about quitting all the time. More failed attempts than I can count.

Yesterday I ran out just before my morning shower and decided to not buy another pack on my way into a meeting. Ended up not buying a pack when I went to grab lunch. Also didn't get a pack on my way home. 


It's been pretty easy so far, although I have this feeling like my skin is crawling and  can tell that I could easily rage out if I don't control myself. 

What helped yesterday was starting a list of 1000 things that are better than smoking. I got 36 down and hope to add many more. Today I will start doing things on the list and adding more as I crave. 

Best Wishes to you All!

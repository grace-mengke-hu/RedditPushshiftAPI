Tomorrow has to be day 1 for me...

I feel like complete shit. It started at 1 smoke a day a year ago. Then 2. Now, anywhere from 4-6.  My chest aches. Iâ€™m out of breath after walking half a mile. I hate the constant taste in my mouth even when I brush my teeth. I feel disgusting. 

All you successful quitters, whether day 3 or 2684, please give your best advice so I can finally kick this nasty habit.

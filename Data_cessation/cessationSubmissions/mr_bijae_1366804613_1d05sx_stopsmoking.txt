72 Hours ~ "Symptoms of chemical withdrawal have peaked in intensity" It is all down hill from here!!

This is not my first rodeo and I know what to expect. The first seventy two hours are the most difficult. This time was no different, with the exception that only the first 24 hours were the most difficult ( I used three nicorette lozenges). The second 24 were not bad at all ( zero lozenges used). The third 24 hours was even easier! Not only did I have more energy to start a physical project, I was not nearly as wiped out when I was finished. The hardest part is over, let the benefits continue to build!

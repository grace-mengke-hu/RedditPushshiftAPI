Visiting mom- first time since quitting

Holy crap- it’s amazing how hard habits die.  I’m visiting my moms for dinner tonight for the first time since quitting.  Ive never really thought about it until now, but usually when I get over here i say my hellos/how ya doings and w/in 15 minutes I’m taking the dogs outside to romp around while i smoke.  My body is telling me “it’s time to go outside w the dogs; come on, let’s go, grab your cigs”.  The dogs are looking at me too, like “common on Mike, we want to go outside and play with you.”  I think I have done a good job avoiding situations that trigger me- I have been staying home instead of bar after work, avoiding friends that smoke, etc.  I think this visit to moms is my first real test.  
I know eventually I have to be strong enough to get through the cravings/situations... just didn’t realize it would be here, where nobody else smokes, and I have an awesome support network all rooting for me.  But I know it’s the nicotine trying to get back into my life through any means necessary! Nicotine is getting desperate trying to rope my dogs into helping me get to smoke again!! 
I AM a non-smoker!!  My dogs are too!! Actually, I think they are going to help me beat Nicotine- the initial craving has passed but I think the next one that comes while I’m here I am going to take them for a walk.

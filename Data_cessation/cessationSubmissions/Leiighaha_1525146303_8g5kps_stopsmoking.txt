Thoughts that have helped me stay on the right path


•smoking is learned behavior (habit)
•habits can very well be broken
• looking at smoking like an ex, "what was I thinking"
•creating distance from the habit creates a clearer mind (physically and mentally)
•my prride increases with time not smoked
•it feels so good to feel proud of something (it's a pretty big deal) 
•It feels good when others are proud of you
• anytime somebody asks me for a cig a big smile comes across my face as I let them know
•my quality of life is so much better and more natural, almost childlike (have more hope for the future)
• feeling healthy is amazing 
• I feel strong 
• remembering that I am rewiring my brain, in the best way possible. 

That's all for now, had to write it down.

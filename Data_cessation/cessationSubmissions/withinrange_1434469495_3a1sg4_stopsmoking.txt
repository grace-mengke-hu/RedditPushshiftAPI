How do you feel when you wake up?

I'm 15 days in on this quit, CT, no NRT, and some days are blessedly peaceful when I wake up. Not today, man. Today I woke up into that silent screaming every-nerve-on-fire level 11 feeling. This is not even a craving, I've finally realized. It's just my body and brain in massive pain. 

The stupid thing is that there is NOTHING driving it. I'm in good health, I live in a great place, I'm generally very happy. It's just the letting go of addiction. I can't imagine what else would make me feel like this.

How are your waking moments? Peaceful? Restful? Total freak out? Why?

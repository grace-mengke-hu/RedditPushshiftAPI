Day 12 and feeling great!

So today is day 12 of my quit. I've smoked 20 a day for the last 30 years and had a couple of failed attempts in the past. I decided enough was enough - I have to quit before it kills me. I bought a months worth of patches a few weeks before my quit date (1st January) feeling sure I would need them. I wore one for the first day, but on the second day I wasn't feeling the need so decided to wait and see how long I could go before I needed to put it on. That was 11 days ago. I've gone cold turkey and never would have believed I could do that!! I had a few cravings in the first few days but got through them by taking deep breaths, drinking water and keeping myself busy. Now I get very few cravings - I can't believe how easy it seems to be. I have tried to quit before using patches, and failed miserably. I believe cold turkey is the only way to do it. I keep telling myself 'the craving won't kill me but smoking will'. That works for me! It's a matter of wanting to quit - I love the fact I don't stink of stale smoke, my breath is fresh, I feel clean and healthier already. I say to everyone trying to quit - hang on in there and take it one day at a time. If I can do it, anyone can. I get such inspiration from reading the posts on here, and I have the smoke free app which gives me a mission to complete each day and shows me how my health is improving day by day and how much time I haven't wasted smoking. Just remember one thing - "The craving won't kill you - but smoking will"

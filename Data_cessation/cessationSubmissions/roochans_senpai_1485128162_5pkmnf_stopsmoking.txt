Fellow redditors - what are your opinions/experiences using nicotine patches vs. cold turkey?

I know many on this sub have successfully quit but still lurk, so to those that have gone a significant amount of time without smoking, what are your opinions/experiences when it comes to nicotine patches vs. cold turkey?

I have a very good opportunity at becoming a police officer and I want/need to quit nicotine as I know it will infinitely benefit me in my possible new job.

Thanks in advance to all that provide answers and best wishes to all those who are thinking of quitting or already have.

Has anyone successfully quit without actually wanting to?

The only reason I quit smoking was to please my girlfriend. The only reason I fought through the first two weeks of agony and depression was to prove to myself that I was strong enough. And the only reason I'm still smoke-free is because... well... you never leave the table on a hot streak, right? I never really wanted to quit and I didn't do it for myself: these are usually death sentences, but I'm still going strong.

Has anyone actually found long term success with this mindset? I'm sure it's unlikely, so where do I go from here? Should I just deny the fact that I liked it for the rest of my life?

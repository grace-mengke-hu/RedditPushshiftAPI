First major drinking occasion - no smoking!

I just got home from a bachelorette weekend at the Delaware seashore. Lots of craziness with several smoker friends (in addition to plenty of strangers smoking around me). In the past, drinking has usually equaled increased smoking. I'm so proud of not bumming a single cigarette or even asking for a drag. 

I've quit several times before and have made my way back to smoking. Here's hoping that I (and everyone else in this subreddit) can continue successfully!

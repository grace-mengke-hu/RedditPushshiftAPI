Help!!! Cracked on vacation, now I feel helpless

So I quit for over 2months and went on vacation / wedding. I made it through most of the vacation, but stupidly justified to myself its ok to smoke on vacation. On my last day I "justified" a pack (but then ill quit when im back) Needless to say, it hasnt happened. Im now a week in and feel helpless. Today I made a pact I would quit and made it til the drive home from work and bought a pack. Has anyone else done this. I know im not "fully" back to where I was, but I know I have the addiction again. I just need to get back in the proper mind frame that im done. Does anyone have any advice or motivation they can pass my way? I feel like a failure. I feel like a failure to myself and my friends and family who were super proud of me.

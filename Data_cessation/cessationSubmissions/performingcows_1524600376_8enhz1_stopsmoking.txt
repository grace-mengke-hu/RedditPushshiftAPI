3 weeks: I was fine but now the cravings are killing me!

Fuck! I thought I had made it through the worst after a week or so had passed. I felt fine, proud and happy about having quiz. But today, extremely stressed, I've had what feels like a constant craving. And it's BAD! Like day 3 bad if not worse. And I don't know how to deal with this on top of my workload that is driving me mad. HELP!

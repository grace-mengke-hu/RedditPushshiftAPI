Day 31 and I'm on top of the World

It's been a challenge getting this far.  Some of my friends smoke and so do my coworkers.  Last night my ecig ran out of batteries and I was helping a friend break down some gear that he'd provided for a local concert.  EVERYONE was smoking and I could feel that warm feeling wash over me and my brain exploded with cravings.  But, I remembered it was my 30th day and I didn't want to ruin my streak and feel like an idiot in the morning (plus.. my gf would have murdered me when I got home.. that helped).  Anyway, I abstained from cigarettes.. continued working and felt like I could conquer anything afterwards.  

Best of luck on your journey down this tough and terrible road.  Every second you stay smoke free is another victory!

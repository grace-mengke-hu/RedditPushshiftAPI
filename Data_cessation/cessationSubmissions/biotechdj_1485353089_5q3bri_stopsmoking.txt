Chantix works for me

I was prescribed Chantix for smoking cessation. I was worried because I've only heard bad things from people around me who took it, nightmares and mood stuff, but I really needed to stop smoking. It took effect in the first 3 days. I did have some side effects like a weird dream or two and nausea when I first started. I'm starting week 3 now and the only side effect I had last week was intense hunger but that was from stopping smoking (i.e. nicotine).

It was free with my insurance. I picked a stop date two weeks after my first dose and actually quit before then because smoking was doing nothing for me. The hardest thing I've been wrestling with is habits. If your insurance can afford it try Chantix. I've tried the patch and Welbutrin but both gave me horrible dreams.

smoking

i’m 17 years old, started smoking a year ago and now it’s eating me alive. i hate the cough you start to develop when you start smoking. i’ve been dependant on them for about a year. :/ i told myself after this pack im done. i need advice on coping with cravings. i have the patches but haven’t started them yet.

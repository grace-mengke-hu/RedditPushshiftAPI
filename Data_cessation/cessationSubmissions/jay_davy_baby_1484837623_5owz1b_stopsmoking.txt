17 Days

Hi guys! I usually don't do new year resolutions but I decided on 1/2/17 to just not go buy any more cigs. I didn't know how long it would last and I amaze myself every day I don't stop to buy some. I haven't bummed any cigs off anyone. I haven't flipped out on my family and friends. I am just completely stunned this is working out.

I have attempted to quit many times before but this was different. This was spur of the moment. This quit feels different and I am almost thinking that this might be the last time I quit.

Its such a freeing and refreshing feeling.  After 17 years of being tied to these stinky expensive things I am taking my life back!

Comming from Smoke Free Beta and about 1 week free!

After 4 years of heavy smoking cigs and smoking cannabis every second day, I have come across this app in the appstore 'Smoke Free Beta' . With its help I tried not just to quit smoking cigs, but also to reduce and even quit my cannabis consume. I'm feeling better everyday and with every new day my cravings get less and less. I allways thought my willpower would be to low to really do this step in my life, but with the help of these 'daily quests' I can finally say, I am on a better way! :)

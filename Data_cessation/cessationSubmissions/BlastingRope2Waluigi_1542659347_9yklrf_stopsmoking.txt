Looking for advice / tips

Hey all. I [22M] have been smoking since I was about 15. It started with cigarettes and hookah, then I switched to cheap cigars from about age 19-21, and then switched back to cigarettes about 4 months ago. I honestly don’t know why I started, but for the last 3 years or so I’ve become really ashamed and self conscious about it. It upsets my mom and disappoints my dad, who was a very heavy smoker up until about 4-5 years ago, and it’s a huge inconvenience for my friends. I smoke about a pack a day currently, and I’m afraid it’s impeding my work performance. Without even mentioning the cost, you’d think all of this would serve as reason enough for me to kick the habit, but I haven’t. I’ve tried to ween myself off with gum and a vape, but I haven’t been able to stick to it. I recently discovered this subreddit and have lurked on a few posts, and everyone seems tremendously supportive and insightful, so I’m going to give it a shot. I’ve made 3 unsuccessful attempts in the past to knock it off, but this time I’m doing it for real, no matter what. I hate feeling controlled by my urges, and I’m ready to take that control back. If you are in the process of quitting, no matter how far along, I would love to hear any advice or tips you have to help me out. Thanks in advance everyone :)

Tl;dr - I’ve been smoking for about 7 years and I’m making the choice to quit for real this time. If you have any advice or tips to offer, it would be greatly appreciated!

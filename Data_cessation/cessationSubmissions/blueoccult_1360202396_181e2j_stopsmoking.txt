Onward my Wayward Son...

I'm sitting here, at my desk, the last cigarette of my last pack in hand.  I want to say it will be my last, but I know I will backslide and eventually have another.  That does not matter.  What matters most is that I quit.  I will never buy another pack of cigarettes.  Ever.  That is the key.  I know I will crave them, I know I will give in and bum one off of a friend or someone at work.  This is inevitable.  What matters is I will not buy them, and eventually I will no longer crave them.  This will take time, but that is okay.  It is worth the time, it is worth the pain, because I know that it is worth it.  My health and peace of mind is worth far more than anything a stick of tobacco can give me.  This is not my first post here, hell, this is not even the first time I have tried to quit.  Far from it.  What matters most is this is the last time I will ever have to quit, because I know this time it is for real.  This time I will quit.  I am down to the filter now, of the last cigarette I will ever buy, and all I have to say now is it feels good.  The last puff.  I am done.

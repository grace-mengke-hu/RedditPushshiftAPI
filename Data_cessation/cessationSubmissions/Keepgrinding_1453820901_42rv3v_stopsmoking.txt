Don't fool yourself

Quitting is a matter of life and death. Don't think it can't happen to you, all those people whose lungs are impaired and who have trouble breathing are urging you to quit smoking.

Think about it consciously, because as smokers we tend to ignore this but it is very real. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aigcxc4JID0 watch this and shiver. Negative motivation works.

Patched yesterday at 4:00am.

Put the patch on at 4:00am yesterday, so I'm about one day and 11 hours smoke free.  It's surprisingly easier than I thought it would be.  I think what kept me from actually quitting was the anxiety of quitting itself, rather than the actual urge to quit.  I'm pretty confident I can stay strong and actually step down from the patches like they're designed.  Wish me luck.... How do I get a badge??

Only for those trying to cut down - not completely quit

I just posted this over in LPT but have realized it may be better suited here.

Simple really. I smoke rolling tobacco but I'm sure it will be similar to cigarette users. I'm not sure why this never occurred to me in previous attempts to cut down.

I've always disliked Amber Leaf, seems to be heavy on my lungs so I switched to that (cheaper too). I went from smoking 12.5g (a pack) a day to only buying once every 3 days effortlessly (really, it doesn't even occur to me I'm smoking less).

I've since started to grow accustomed to Amber Leaf and I'm now buying every second day so I'm thinking about alternating it with Golden Virginia (fucking hate GV) to hopefully make it back to 3, or possibly 4 days between purchases.

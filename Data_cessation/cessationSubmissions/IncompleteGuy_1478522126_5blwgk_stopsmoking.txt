I'm 21 and want to get my shit together. I decided to stop smoking today and I have some questions.

Hey, so as the title says, I'm a young guy, been smoking for 4 years and decided to quit. I believe the term is "quitting cold turkey". From a pack a day to 0. 

I've tried numerous times and the best I got was 7 days. After 7 days I manipulated myself into smoking as in:

- It will be only one cigarette

- Only one pack so I can quit for good

- Only when I'm drinking alcohol

- etc.

You all know how that went. Failed every time. 

Â  

That's why I need your help in answering some questions for me. I believe everyone that has already stopped smoking can answer them. Here they go:

1. How do you "unlink" certain activities with smoking? For example, I always smoke(d) when I drink coffee. I can't even imagine drinking coffee without smoking. Should I try to "unlink" those two activities or stop drinking coffee as well? Same goes with alcohol and/or going on a drink with friends. 

2. Smoking is not only an addiction, but also a habit. How do you break this habit? Do you replace it with something else or just deal with it? 

3. How do you deal with your friends smoking in front of you? Even when I could stop for a while, I couldn't resist cigarettes if my friends were smoking in front of me. My addicted brain went: "Why are they allowed to smoke, and we aren't? That's unfair."

4. What are some everyday benefits of quitting you have noticed? Something you could really feel. Was is better breath? Whiter teeth? More energy? Anything goes. 

5. Did something help you quit? Was it a mobile app? Friend/family support? Motivational quote/article/website? Fear of health problems? Let me know. Also if you have some tips on how to get through with quitting, also let me know. 

**If you can't or don't want to answer all questions, feel free to just answer the one(s) you can/want. Every bit of help is appreciated.**

Thanks in advance.

The smell of butts in the pocket...

I remember coming home and going through my pockets and throwing out the butt or two that I'd absentmindedly stashed because no ash tray or garbage was around.  The stink was terrible.  I cringe to think about how I smelled.  I would change clothes and wash frequently to try and minimize it, but yuck.  

Anyway, I'm so happy to not have that worry.  I was really missing smoking for a minute this afternoon, with the lovely weather and the balcony so inviting.  I'll go for a jog and then see if sitting on the balcony with some chips and dip is just as enjoyable.

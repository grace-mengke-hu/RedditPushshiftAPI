I’m ready

15 years. 

My health insurance this year requires a nicotine detection test in order to get lower rates. 

I’m almost 40 now. I’m starting to feel older and look older. My hands are starting to wrinkle on the back. I’m getting more gray hair. 

My 13 year old daughter and her friend had a sleepover and we did face masks and I helped then put it on. Their skin is beautiful. Mine was not. I got sad at the thought of them ruining theirs. I felt ashamed to have mine next to theirs. 

I don’t smoke at home in front of my kids. I do go outside at night but I don’t like them to see me do it. They know though. 

I started painting more. That keeps me busy. But I tend to get caught up in it due to my hyper focus tendencies associated with my ADD. I’ve made eight paintings in the last three weeks. That’s more than I made all last year. I forgot how much I enjoyed it. I’m still pretty good at it. 


My doctor increased my bupropion prescription. It’s for depression and anxiety and wasn’t prescribed specifically for smoking cessation. It has started to make me not enjoy smoking. Not that I enjoyed it anyway but you know what I mean. I’m hoping that it keeps on. 

I have 9 left. I may finish them but I’m going to think really hard before I have one. 

My mom passed away at age 42. She wasn’t a great mother.  She was a heavy smoker and obese. I’m almost that age. I am already a better mother than she was so I don’t want to end up like her. That would just undo all of the things I’ve done in my life to eliminate any influence her choices have in my life now. 

I’ve got to do this. I need to do this.

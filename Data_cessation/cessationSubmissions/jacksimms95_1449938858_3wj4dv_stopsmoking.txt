Sweating more after quitting?

I've been 6 days clean (6 days! *Never* thought I'd manage that...) and have in the last few days noticed that I've been sweating *like a bitch*. Like, more than I have in years. It's accompanied by a feeling of being generally way too warm, even when I'm almost naked in a cool room. 

Is this something to do with quitting, and have any of you had this? 

I went cold turkey from 20 a day to nothing, if that matters...

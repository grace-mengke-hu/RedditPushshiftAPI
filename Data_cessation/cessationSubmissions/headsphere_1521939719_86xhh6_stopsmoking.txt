7th day. Still can't enjoy a beer or a large meal :(

I started smoking/drinking around the same time when I was 14. Never since then had a drink without smoking. Am 25 now, on my 4th real attempt to quit in the last 5 years, and 7 days is the farthest I've ever been. When I'm not drinking alcohol or eating lightly, I do fine. But it's saturday, I want to relax a little. I had 2 beers, and immediately began getting very rough cravings. 

this sucks.

Trying to quit

Alright ladies and gents, I'm sure there's been a hundred posts like this, but this one is mine. I'm currently trying the e-cig and stepping down on nicotine. I've gone from a pack a day to four cigarettes a day. I'm trying to quit, but I have a few problems. One, I really like smoking. Everything about it. I've had family die from it, but death doesn't bother me, even the slow and painful kind. Second, I like drinking, and nothing substitutes for a good cigarette while drunk, which brings me to my third point. Three, the e-cig doesn't cut it. It's not the same, but I think we all know that. I want to be around for my family. Now and in the future, (wife, kids, whatever I have.) But it's hard to stop doing something when it's something you like. I don't know what I'm looking for. Whether it be advice or support, I just hope for some help. I want to be healthier, I do, but I like smoking, and I'm having a hard time. What works for you, what can I try?

how to stop the recurrence

Hey ,

The very fact that i am posting in this subreddit means that I need some help in getting out of the situation i find myself in. I was a habitual smoker and then as would any smoker would do, smoked packs until one day i quit it . IT was difficult at first, I used some smoke free applications, logged my process and it was nice that i could stop it for some time. So i stayed away from smoking for some 15-16 months.. However I recently joined another grad school and there i have again started smoking and find it difficult to go back to my non smoking days. Any tips to overcome the present situation would be welcomed.

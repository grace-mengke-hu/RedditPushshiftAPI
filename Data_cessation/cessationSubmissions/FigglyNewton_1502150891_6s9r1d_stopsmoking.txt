2 Years and Still Going! Thanks to this Sub!

Thanks to everyone here, I quit cold turkey because of this sub and have been free and clear for 2 years. I can safely say at this stage, nothing would ever tempt me to start smoking again, no psychological or physical reason. I'm 100% free.

I got so much help and advice here, and everything I was told along the way about what I would experience physically and mentally was true, so I knew what to expect. I especially didn't feel alone in this. To any newbie's reading this, log-in everyday here and you'll make it.

For those who are past the 6 month mark, I want to make note of a symptom I didn't really hear much about here - failure dreams. They're actually kind of nightmares and really unnerving and depressing. I started having them at around 6 months and they lasted around 1 year. They all take the same form, although the circumstances change. Basically, somehow you end up smoking in the dream, usually by being tricked and you realize you've broken your vow and failed. You wake up in a cold sweat and they're enough to make you grab for a cigarette gasping in the dark. Don't give in guys!

Anyway, good luck to everyone! Hope you get to here. Don't believe anyone who tells you "you'll always feel like smoking". It really does completely go away. You really can be free. And BTW the way I smoked over 20 a day for 33 years.

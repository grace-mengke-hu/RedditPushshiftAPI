Not sure how to deal with this problem...

I'm always telling myself that I can't quit yet. That I have to have one more night with a bottle of bourbon, or have a cigarette with coffee one more time. That I'll quit after I have another cigarette after sex, or after one more drive listening to my favorite music. I'm sure someone who's trying to/has quit can relate, but these thoughts in my head get so bad to me that I feel like I can't give it up. It feels almost to the point of OCD but I really think nicotine has just taken over so much that it feels like I never feel that final accomplished moment to where I can quit. Anyone else been through this and have any advice for me?

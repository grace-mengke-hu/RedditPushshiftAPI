I vaped for 2 weeks and just smoked a cigarette.

So I just smoked a cigarette after vaporizing "e-cigs" for a few weeks and just wanted to share my experience.  

It is Friday, I had just gotten off work, bought a 6-pack of my Blue Moon and a pack of my favorite cigarettes.  Part of me didn't feel the need to smoke anymore since I've been already satisfying my nicotine needs through vaping.  But, I was looking to start off the weekend right.  I was seeking that experience that most former and current smokers would recognize.  That perfect cigarette and beer at the end of the work week.

So I sat on my chair, popped open my beer, kicked back and lit up my cigarette.  And you know what?  Not surprisingly, it didn't do it for me.  To be honest, it tasted awful and I felt nasty afterwards.  Not guilty for smoking just the nasty feeling you get from smoking.  

I realized that this "perfect cigarette moment" was probably just mostly nicotine and partly ritual.  Once I replaced the nicotine with an alternative, cigarettes no longer had that effect on me.

Some of you might be glorifying smoking in your head at this moment.  That moment when you just kick back and smoke the stress away.  Truth is, that's just the lack of nicotine talking.  The only thing you are doing is satisfying a craving which gives you this false sense of accomplishment.  

Until today, I didn't realize that.  I am a guy that loves smoking.  After waning myself a bit, I can honestly say, it was extremely overrated.  

So take what you will from my experience.  Like others have said before, the illusion you're trying to accomplish by smoking is what non-smokers have already.  

The question is, do you want true independence or the illusions of escape?

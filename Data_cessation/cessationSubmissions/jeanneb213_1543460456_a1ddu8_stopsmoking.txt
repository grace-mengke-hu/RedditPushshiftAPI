57 days smoke free. Wine. Christmas ðŸŽ„. Cravings.

I love that I can come here and just put that out into the universe. Honestly, itâ€™s not like those small but significant moments have another good place to go. If I called friends every time I craved one, Iâ€™d have no friends. Seriously, I wonâ€™t back down but I can acknowledge that itâ€™s difficult at moments. Thanks for â€œlistening â€œ ðŸ™‚

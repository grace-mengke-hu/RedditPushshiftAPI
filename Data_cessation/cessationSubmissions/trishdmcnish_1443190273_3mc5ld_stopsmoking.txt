To vape or not to vape?

I'm a heavy smoker, for about 15 years, and I am quitting today at 6 pm. My boyfriend isn't ready to quit, but promised he would get rid of all the ashtrays and leave the building (rather than going out on the balcony) to smoke. I'm ready. I'm just not sure whether I should use my e-cig (which I really like and has helped me cut down significantly in the past, and I find REALLY makes it easy to not smoke) or just go 'cold turkey'. I've quit a few times in the past and found the cravings to be... killer - lasting for more than a half hour, making me blind with rage, etc. 

I feel like I need to make a decision before I quit (6 pm tonight). Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm going to go buy vape juice anyway just in case. Also gum. And toothpicks. And a stress ball.

Edit: I had my last smoke at 3 pm, not 6 ;)

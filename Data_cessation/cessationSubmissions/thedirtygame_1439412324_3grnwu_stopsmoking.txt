Hey everyone. I'm here, out in the open now.

I'm at 16 days as of today, but I haven't been saying much about it, to friends, family or on social media.  Well, now I am here.  I've been a half-to-full pack a day smoker for about 12, 13 years (I'm 31 now) and I feel really good about how far I've gotten so far by quitting cold turkey.

The first few days are by far the hardest.  Trying not to have one when arguing with someone, or dealing with crap at work is still a chore, but I've somehow managed to not go back.  Sunflower seeds have been very helpful, for those times when you want to go outside to have one.

My skin is clearing up (wasn't too bad even as a smoker), my teeth and breath are cleaner, and oh my goodness my sense of smell and taste is like that of a greyhound or something.

Oh, I've saved some money too.  The four different quit smoking apps I have downloaded on my phone agree with that.  I also love reading the numerous health related stats that each app provides.

My friends, who all smoke, are in disbelief.  I know that the cravings will be with me for the rest of my life, but, I also know that the oh-my-god-I-need-one-so-bad feeling only lasts a few days; make it over that hump, then it really does only get easier.

Good luck to those in similar spots as me, or still early on in the process.  If you are lurking and wanting to quit but can't, feel free to message me and I can try to help.

Thanks for reading ya'll!  This sub has also been helpful in making it to a whopping 16 days smoke free as well, so many thanks to all of you.

EDIT: Some grammar.

No phlegm

I'm about 2 weeks into quitting. I am in the process of doing a complete 180 of my health habits starting with smoking. I'm 32 and been smoking since I was about 16 consistently about 20 smokes a day, a hell of a lot more when drinking. Unfortunately I'm also somewhat of an alcoholic which never helped my intake drinking 4 or 5 times a week

I'd like to ask any others experiences with not coughing or no phlegm. I'm getting nothing. I've quit in the past and within a week I would cough shit up. I've been exercising quite heavily since the quit so I was thinking it would loosen it up.

Hoping to stay quit. Thanks

Off to /r/stopdrinking I go!!!

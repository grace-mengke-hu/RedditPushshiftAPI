Hour one.

I have one cigarette left, and a spliff rolled.  I'm about to head out to my favorite smoke spot, roast this spliff, enjoy this last cigarette, and call it quits.  I've tried quitting before, and have had poor to moderate success.  I just don't have the money to be blowing $8 a day, and don't like how if I have to hurry to class I can barely climb a few flights of stairs without getting short on breath.  I was going to try gum or the patch but once again... Money.  Oh well.

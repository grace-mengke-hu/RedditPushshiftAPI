I got my One Week Badge!

I am using chantix and coming here and it has helped me quit a 15 plus year addiction. I can breathe! Last night, I realized I can sing an entire song normally again, no shortness of breath and no gasping for air. It felt so good and my family is so proud of me. Thank you, stopsmoking. I come here every time I need some encouragement. Here's to a smoke free life!

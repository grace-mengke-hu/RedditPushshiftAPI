Miserable. I think.

I recently had surgery, and as a result, had to be out of work for several weeks. Because of financial concerns, I decided to quit smoking. 

I hate it. I'm not proud of myself. I don't feel like I've accomplished anything. Everything tastes funny or smells bad, and I don't know what to do with my hands when I'm driving. Even the little bit of drinking I do isn't as fun.

I'm seriously considering starting back when I go back to work.

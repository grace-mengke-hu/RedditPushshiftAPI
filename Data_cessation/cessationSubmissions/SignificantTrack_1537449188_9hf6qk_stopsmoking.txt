Little over a month, craving is there but sticking to my decision

It’s been a month and two weeks since I’ve quit, using champix with it, man... it doesn’t do much for the cravings, I’m actually having a big one while writing this, but I won’t have another cigarette.

Last time I quit for 7 months and what got me was a single cigarette, “Just one” I told myself, that got me smoking again.

Staying strong this time and keeping in mind that even one, one lousy stinking cigarette will take me down.

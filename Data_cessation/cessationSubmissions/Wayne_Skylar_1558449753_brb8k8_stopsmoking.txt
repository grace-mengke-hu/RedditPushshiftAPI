After seven weeks only now am I beginning to feel like a non-smoker. Can anyone relate?

So this particular quit has been difficult for me. I've made about two to three serious quit attempts in the 20 years I've been smoking. But this time has been hard. Cravings haven't been bad, but I've been feeling off since I quit. People say that after a month or so they feel great and that hasn't been my experience. I had smoking dreams nearly every night for the first six weeks, and sleep has been inconsistent.

But I feel like I've had a feeling that something was missing. But it's not really a fully formed thought. It's not like I'm craving a cigarette, but it's just the feeling that something is wrong. The previous two weeks my anxiety seemed to be an issue. Nothing serious, just tightness in my chest and a feeling that I couldn't get a satisfying breath. This is not a health issue, by the way, just one of the ways I can be anxious. This has happened to me since I was young. 

Weirdly I have been salivating a lot more than in the past. This week has been a little different. I am beginning to feel closer to normal. I feel like I'm beginning to get the hang of it. 

I was wondering if anyone was in the same boat as me. By most accounts I should be feeling normal by now, but it seems like it's taking longer with me.

1 year smoke free!

Hi guys. Just wanted to come in here and say as of May 7th, I have been cigarette free for a whole year. 

I didn't really post in this sub, but lurked often for some inspiration. So thank you for that. Full disclosure, I do vape. However, I have been weening off of nicotine over time and should be down to zero some time this summer. 

Just want to tell all of you out there who want to quit that nasty habit, that it is doable!  

I smoked 1.5-2 packs a day for 15 years and last May I just said "Fuck it!" 

The first couple weeks were the hardest, but it gets significantly easier over time. I don't even mind being around smokers at all.

Even my vices for smoking (morning, after meals, drinking, stress) went away over time.

And bedside the health aspects, I saved $3700 over the past year, and feel a whole lot better. No more "lung cookies" in the morning. 

Even if one person sees this and it motivates them, that's enough for me. 

The biggest help for me was the Smoke Free app. It really helped motivate me by keeping tabs on the money I was saving and calculating the amount of cigarettes I haven't smoked. 

For the people on the fence out there, it can be done. Do it for your self. You'll be happy you did. 

That's my .02. And like I said, maybe just one person will see this and make the decision to stop the habit. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

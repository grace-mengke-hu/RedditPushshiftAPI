I miss it.

I used to smoke for 3 years of which the last 1 year i smoked only 4-5 cigarettes a day,i was never a heavy smoker though,i found it disgusting. I have quited smoking with the help of vaping for 6 months now,i haven't even touched a cigarette and i'm 1,5 month nicotine free. I can't say that it was hard for me to accomplish this. I still vape a nicotine free e-liquid without flavor. I haven't enjoyed any health benefits except of the bad smell of my clothes.

However,there is a problem now. I have started missing it. I don't crave nicotine. I miss the whole thing. How is it to miss a good memory? It's like this. I don't feel happy without it. I can't enjoy the things i used to do when i smoked. I am about to do something enjoyable(vacations) and my mind gets crazy because i'm afraid that i won't enjoy them without smoking.I'm thinking about starting smoking again, but that is also not easy. I want and i don't want in the same time because it has been a long time without it. I don't know. Help me.

Need advice to quit smoking when I drink.

I used to be a half-pack a day smoker when I worked at a coffee shop. I successfully quit entirely for a year during 2014, but this year I started smoking when I drink. I haven't smoked at all unless I drink, but I drink often. Even then, it's only ever about one or two cigarettes when I drink, rarely more than that. I want to quit entirely, but it's hard when the inhibitions are lowered. I used the patch to quit before, but that's an extended release of nicotine, which I don't need. I was wondering what the best solution is for a quick fix that I can ween myself off of. I'm thinking gum, but I have no experience with it. I was hoping the folks on this sub could help me with a solution. Any advice is helpful.

Cigarette Dangers vs. Nicotine Dangers

I'm curious on the negative effects of **just** nicotine, versus the nicotine in combination with a cigarette.

I've switched to an eCig and have really made a lot of progress, but I'm wondering just how much better it is for me. I know there could be unknown factors behind the eCig, but that's not what I'm asking. I am just looking at nicotine vs cigarettes (vs neither). Any insight would be amazing. Thanks in advance!

Count down to quit day is close, and this is going to be my support

I am quitting full out starting next Monday.  I have been using an e-cig to supplement my smoking and have cut it down A LOT (from > half a pack when drinking to 3-4).  Didn't have any for two days in a row, then last night smoked two with some beers.  Today I can FEEL it in my throat and body!  Can't wait to get rid of that feeling permanently!

For those of you wondering: I am vacationing with a lot of friends who smoke until next week, so don't want to set myself up to stop fully until I am back home.

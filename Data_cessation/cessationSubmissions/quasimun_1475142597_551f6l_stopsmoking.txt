Let's try again

Hey guys, my second quit attempt now. I was a smoker for about 2-3 years, casually, but smoked more and more as I chilled more with friends who smoked a lot. 

Last year I decided fuck it, after a few failed attempts to quit (hanging out with those friends made it almost impossible to stop). My girlfriend and I both decided to quit together. 

I managed to quit for 8 months. It was pretty easy, didn't buy any, and hung out with those buddies less. Fast forward, and I started having some social cigarettes with them and before I knew it, it all spiralled out of control and I was a smoker again. It also sucked trying to hide the fact that I'm a smoker from my girlfriend...felt guilty a lot of the time, and somewhat ashamed.

I'm not going to the local stop smoking service who are providing me nicotine patches which are really helpful, and for now I'm avoiding those smoker buddies because that's how I messed up last time! I feel like this time is for good. 

I've broken the addictive feelings and I'm feeling good right now. I just hope I stay strong and make it through this early stage :D

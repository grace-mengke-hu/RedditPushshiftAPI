Hi! New here, have some questions about eCiggs.

Hi /r/stopsmoking I've just discovered you the other day and you gave me the final push to give quitting another try. I'm so fed up with coughing, having yellow fingers and smelly hair. I hate having ashes all over my porch and having to plan smoke breaks! I've smoked since I was thirteen and my body needs a chance to breath.

My questions are about using eCiggs to quit. I'm not sure what this sub's view is on them, and I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place.

I've just bought one and I'm wondering if anyone has used one to quit? Was it easier using an eCigg to quit and then quitting the eCigg or is it better to quit cold turkey? Is it even a good stop smoking method or is it just another addiction? How can I tell when the cartridge needs to be changed? I am afraid I'm using it more often than I do cigarettes because I am still craving nicotine and I'm not used to the eCigg yet at all.

Thanks for reading and again if this is in the wrong place I'll take it right down!

Stopped 10 years and this is how I did it... hope it helps someone else.

What's the old saying? Stopping smoking is easy, I've done it a thousand times...

But, it's no joke for anyone really wanting to stop and finding it impossible. I know, I've been there...

I've summarised what worked for me. I've been clean little over 10 years now (not touched one) and I stopped on the eve of my 40th birthday too :/ *(believe me, nobody is more shocked at that statement, than I am)* ;)

Anyway, in the simple hope it might truly help someone else, you can find my method [**HERE**](https://spikeblogs.com/health-blog/physical-health/how-to-stop-smoking-for-good/).

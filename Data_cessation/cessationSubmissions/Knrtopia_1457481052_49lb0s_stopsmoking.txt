Life feels empty without cigarettes

I've gone a week without a cigarette and so far so good. To be honest, it hasn't been too difficult because I'm so set on quitting. The problem is life feels emptier without smoking. Little made me feel as fulfilled as a cigarette

Did/Do you feel the same?

It feels like I lost a family member and it's so stupid

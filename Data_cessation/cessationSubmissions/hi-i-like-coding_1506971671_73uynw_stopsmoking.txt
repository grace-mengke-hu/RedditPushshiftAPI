Checking in. Still wanting to quit.

I would really like to quit vaping. Quitting has been on my mind for a while now, but I can't seem to make it past 2 or 3 days.

I always go like one or two days without vaping, and the feeling is great. I love the feeling of not having any nicotine for a while. It's great, yet for some reason I can't make it past those 2 or 3 days.

I'm considering making another attempt today.

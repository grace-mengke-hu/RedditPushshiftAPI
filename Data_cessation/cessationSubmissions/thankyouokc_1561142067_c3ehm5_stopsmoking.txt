I think I finally am on my way to being a non smoker

According to my smoke free app, I’m 2 days and 16 hours into being smoke free. I’ve attempted many times before and usually relapsed at the 24 hour mark. 

I’ve dealt with many temptations over these last few days. On day one, I was in the car with my smoker friend. She pulled one out and started smoking. Now, being as we both smoke, we bum off each other all the time. Watching her beat open a fresh pack and inhale was hard. I wanted to ask her for one so bad. But I didn’t. 

Temptation number two. My dad is my neighbor and I let him use my debit card to get some groceries last night (he’s like, really poor so I let him use money all the time). I asked him to grab me a few things but I was in the shower when he got back, so he just left them on the counter. There were the items I asked him to get me, my debit card, and three cigarettes. Maybe the cigarettes were reimbursement for the groceries. He knows I’m attempting to quit again, but every time I try, he offers me cigarettes. It’s a cycle. 

I should have instantly broke them, flushed them, whatever. But I didn’t. Instead, I lied down in bed trying to go to sleep. All I could think about was how badly I wanted one of those cigarettes. But I didn’t do it. 

Well. I just relapsed. Kinda. I went to smoke. I took one hit, didn’t really inhale. It was disgusting, tasted like how cigarettes do when you first smoke. I put it out and broke it immediately. 

Maybe this time I’ll really be done, for real.

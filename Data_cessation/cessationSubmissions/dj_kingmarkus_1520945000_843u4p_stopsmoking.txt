How was your 1st social gathering drinking being around smokers after quitting ?

i have a friends bday march 17th which will be 11 days in since i quit they chain smoke and party hard.
i feel good though cravings have gone away thus far but i haven't had a drink since i quit and that was a major trigger for me ..wish me luck !!!

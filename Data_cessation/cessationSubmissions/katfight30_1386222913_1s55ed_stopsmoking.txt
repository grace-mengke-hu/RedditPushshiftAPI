Quitting....smart phone apps

I just discovered these quit smoking phone apps and I have to say they really give that extra bit of motivation!  It is definitely helpful to see specific numbers, as in how much money I've saved, how many cigarettes I have not smoked...Unfortunately they are both european based (I'm in the US) but they still really seem to help that extra bit.  Just wanted to suggest these to others!  I have downloaded "Breathe! Stop Smoking" and "QuitNow!"

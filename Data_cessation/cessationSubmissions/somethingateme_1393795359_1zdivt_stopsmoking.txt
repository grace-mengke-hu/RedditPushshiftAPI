On day 2

Definitely easier than day one.  Though I've been feeding my face like the food is about to spoil, I have done a lot of other things to keep my mind off of that nasty habit.  If I left it wander just for a second,  the habit is the 1st thing to pop in.

anyway, I'm making and hope you all are as well.

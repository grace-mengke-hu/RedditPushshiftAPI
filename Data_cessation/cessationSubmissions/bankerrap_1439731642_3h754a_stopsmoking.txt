Don’t listen to nicotine – he’s a dick

I feel like I've been hanging out with nicotine forever, he's just always been around. I mean, I know its been maybe 10 years - but seriously, it's like, I had forgotten what life was like without him. 

The thing is, I got rid of him seven days ago, and now I realise he was a total dick. He was just the worst friend. First off, several of my friends hated him - he smelt awful - but they were sometimes too polite to say. Instead, they'd sometimes say - when are you going to stop hanging around with nicotine?

I'd just laugh - I mean he was cool, right? That must be why I was with him all the time; why I couldn't have a drink without him. 

But now I think about it he wasn’t cool at all, he was just really needy. He couldn't let me just hang with my friends, without making me go outside to be with him. I couldn't watch a film without him bugging me. He made me lazy, and anxious.

He made me think I enjoyed his company, but really - I just wanted him to stop annoying me all the time. 

He also made me sick – I mean what kind of friend purposely makes you sick? And still makes you hang out with them, all day, every day. And why would I hang out with him? Because…

I am an addict.

So last Monday, I decided to stop hanging out with him. I decided to not listen to him bugging me, and slowly, every day he is losing interest. He’s getting quieter and quieter.

The moral is: Don’t listen to nicotine – he’s a dick.

15 days free and counting

Hello all, 

15 days smoke free!  I canâ€™t believe it but it is so real.  I hate going to the convenience store for gas because that temptation is always there.  Smoking is the devil and it will always try to get you when your guard is down.  Stay strong folks!  If I can do It, everyone can.  

Thank you for reading.

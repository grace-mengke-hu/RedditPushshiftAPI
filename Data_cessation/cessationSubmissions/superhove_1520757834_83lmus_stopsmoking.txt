Day one (again)

So, I’ve just had my last cigarette. I’ve made a couple of attempts over the last four months with varying degrees of success. Decided pretty much out of nowhere in December that I was quitting smoking and I managed 17 days before Christmas in retail got the better of me. Tried again in February but my past failure was still strong in my mind so only managed six days. Went back to smoking and couldn’t believe how shit it makes me feel. I’ve been noticing all week how short of breath I’ve become again and I don’t want to do it anymore. Hopefully I’m strong enough to make this the last time.

Quitting for real this time

I quit before, for about a year and a half. I quit my job and smoked that night. That one cigarette got me hooked again. I regret it more than anything else. Then I tried quitting again since then but wasn’t in the right state of mind. Now is my time. I’m ready for it. I just might need your help. I promise to post my progress so I can be proud of myself, but others can be too.  I can do this.

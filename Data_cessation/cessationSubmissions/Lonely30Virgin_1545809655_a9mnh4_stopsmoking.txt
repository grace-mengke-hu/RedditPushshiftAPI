I smoke off and on (4-5 cigs a month) but I'm paranoid i will get bronchitis. Do you think this is possible?

My friend smokes a pack a day and had chronic bronchitis and now I'm paranoid. I only smoke when I drink which is once or twice a month for enjoyment. I'm a singer so I hate coughing because of what it does to the vocal folds. Am I being ridiculous or should I just not drink and avoid smoking those 5 cigs?

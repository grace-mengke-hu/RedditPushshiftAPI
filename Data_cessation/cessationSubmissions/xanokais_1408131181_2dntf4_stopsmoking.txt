Time for a fifth try...maybe my willpower is stronger this time around?

I'm ready, and have been ready since attempt #3.  I just cant seem to keep my mind focused to get through the cravings.  I feel like they don't last just a few minutes like they did on attempt #3, now they feel like they last hours.  

I'll repeat this to myself over and over until I do it: I want this.  I. Want. This.  

Recap:

1. Made it three weeks, relapsed when grandfather died.
2. Made it two weeks, relapsed when stressing over work.
3. Made it two **months**, relapsed when my car got totaled while I was closing on my first house.
4. Made it a week,  relapsed for no particular reason (I was stupid).
5. Starts **NOW**, and there will be no relapse this time.

I quit smoking again yesterday, wish me luck reddit :)

I have been an on and off smoker since I was 12 years old (I'm almost 36 now)  I had quit for about 4 months and then relapsed 2 months ago.  

I had been using the gum to quit, but every time I relapse my nicotine levels are actually higher from the gum and I relapse with a worse habit than before.  I went from a pack+ per day to the patch yesterday morning.  This is my second day with the patch and I' doin it!  **I'M DOIN' IT THIS TIME!!!!!!**

wearin the patch right now...  :)

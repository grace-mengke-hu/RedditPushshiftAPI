18 days without a single puff, got to proudly turn down the 7-11 clerk!

Today was the first day I went to my local 7-11 since I quit. I grabbed a few beverages and went up to the register. The clerk said, “pack of camel crush?” I’ve never been more proud of myself than when I said, “Oh! No thank you, I quit.” I wasn’t even tempted even though that has been temptation enough before.

For those of you just beginning your journey, the first week is the hardest, but the rewards outweigh the temptation!!! Only on day 18 and I can sit with my smoker friends now and be okay (although, now that my sense of smell is back, it gives me a headache). Hang in there! You will get there!!!

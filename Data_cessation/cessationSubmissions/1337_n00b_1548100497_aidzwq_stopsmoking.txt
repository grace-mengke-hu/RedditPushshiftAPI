So long, ex-smokers and ex-smokers to be!

I joined this sub when I wanted to quit. Then I managed to quit, or perhaps rather substitute my cigarette addiction with an e-cigarette addiction. I beat the former a year ago or so.

This sub is a nice community, but being 100% smoke free (and missing it very, very rarely) I now feel confident to wish you all the best and unsubscribe. 

Good luck. It CAN be done!

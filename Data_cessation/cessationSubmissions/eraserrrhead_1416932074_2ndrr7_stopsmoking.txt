Hey reddit, I'm 23f and today is my first day quitting smoking! I'm looking for any "psychological hacks" that'll help me through the cravings. Example inside... HELP, I'M DESPERATE!

Hey guys, so I'm a 23 year old female who's been smoking between a half a pack to over a whole pack of menthol cigarettes since the age of thirteen... that's right, I've been smoking for TEN YEARS! (Please note this isn't my first attempt to quit)

Anyway, last night I finished my last cigarette and this morning I woke up and had my morning coffee feeling like something was missing- DUH! A cigarette! (They say cravings go away in five minutes but it's been 3 hours)

I'm planning on doing this cold turkey- I've attempted quitting before, using the patch, the gum, the lozenges, the E-ciggs and I always went back. I want to be off nicotine altogether! I just want to get rid of this crutch...

(Plus the patch irritated my skin, and the gum and lozenges always made my throat feel like it was closing up.)

Once someone told me of a psychological hack to fight off cravings. Her mother hated hated HATED anything spicy, so whenever she had a strong craving for a cigarette, she'd pop a fireball candy (those red cinnamon candy balls) and successfully quit using this method because after a while of using the fireball method (lol) whenever she had a craving, she'd associate the craving with the unpleasant taste of the candy and the craving would pass. (I hope that makes sense!)

Can anyone offer any more psychological tips like this? Or **any** tips at all? I'd appreciate it so much and hopefully this post will help others in the same situation I'm in!

Sorry this was so long! I'm relying on my fellow Redditors to help a girl out, so don't let me down!

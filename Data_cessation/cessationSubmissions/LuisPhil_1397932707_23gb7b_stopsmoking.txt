Ugh i know understand the power of my addiction/disease still struggling..

Day 41 here. However it still calls me daily a few times throughout. Im beginning to understand the power of this addiction and why so many find it hard to quit. Although im over the physical part of it the psychological part is still alive. The monster although locked up still is influencing me in minor ways. As all smokers i regret ever getting hooked. I saw my nephew yesterday with a e-cigg. He's 18 and the mayor just passed a law making it illegal to buy until your 21. I told dont mess with that. Oh its not like smoking i said yes the drug in it is very powerful and sooon you have the diseases like your uncle. He did toss it out. On to me i just dont know about this struggle im starting to get weak and want to cave in . Im not sure if its just the fact that i cant wants e to do it more. Yes i did read Carr's book.

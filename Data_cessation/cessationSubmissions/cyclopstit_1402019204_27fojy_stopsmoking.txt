So I went a year! Thanks for all the help! And I'd like to offer my biggest piece of advice.

So I've made it a year, and I haven't had a craving for some time now. My plan now is to remain vigilant, and remember why I stopped smoking, which was because it was expensive and I was really beginning to feel like shit. But now I'm a pretty healthy dude, and I work at the grants office of a major cancer research hospital.

My biggest piece of advice is to remember when you get a craving that IT WILL SUBSIDE, MOST LIKELY WITHOUT YOU NOTICING. When a craving hits, it has this funny way of making you feel like it's never going to end, so you figure you might as well smoke to get rid of it. But then later, you remember that you had a craving and chuckle about how it went away and you didn't even notice.

So special thanks to this subreddit, and to whyquit.com, especially Joel's quit video library http://whyquit.com/joel/

Good luck everyone! You can do this! It get's easier!

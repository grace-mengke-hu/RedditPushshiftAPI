Three weeks, and by the gods, does this world smell.

I had no idea so many things smelled so much. I've been smoking for 25 years or more. Three weeks in, while I'm not noticing many other changes, it occurred to me last night that I was smelling a lot of things. Not all of them were pleasant smells, either. I could smell the laundry detergent from my clothes when I moved my arm. There was a strong scent of garbage coming from the bin in its cupboard.  I ended up having to take out the trash. The dog got a pine sap drip in her fur, and I could smell it from the other side of the room. This is fairly amazing, and unexpected. I had no idea my nose was so dulled by the cigarettes.

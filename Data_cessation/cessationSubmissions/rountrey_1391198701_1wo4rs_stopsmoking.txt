I think I have an odd "hardest time" for a craving.

It's been 4 days and I do believe I'm over the worst of it. I have this particular point of the day, a couple of times a day actually that the craving hits me hard. When driving. I've heard so many others that their hard times are after eating, first thing in the morning, or after having a few drinks (alcohol). But every time I get in my car I want to light up. Of course, I can't because I don't have any cigarettes, but I do want to pull into every gas station and convenience store I pass on the way to and from work and get a pack.

Sometimes I think that I should buy a pack just to throw it away. (random thought)

Anyway the odd thing is, that I've only had this car for 3 weeks and have never smoked it it. The previous owner has never smoked in it in the 10 years she had owned it. This is why I just don't really understand about why driving is affecting me so much.

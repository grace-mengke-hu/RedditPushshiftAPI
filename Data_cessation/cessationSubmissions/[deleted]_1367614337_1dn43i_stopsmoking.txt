On the brink of collapse

I've been smoke free for nearly five months. I've quit for longer before, this is yet another attempt. I don't know why I am craving but I have been craving pretty bad the last couple weeks. I always hate myself after I smoke, yet I always find some way to convince myself that it's OK after a few months of being smoke free. This addiction is insane.

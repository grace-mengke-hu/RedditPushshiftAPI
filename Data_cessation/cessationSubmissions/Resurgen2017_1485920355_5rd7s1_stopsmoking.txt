30 year smoker 3 days quit

New to this group, not new to trying to quit. I downloaded and app on day 2. I am going cold turkey, no NRT! I have had some difficulty at times. I have been arguing with my brain. It continues to try and convince me that what I am doing is wrong and neglectful! How could you do this to me, my brain keeps saying! I keep arguing with my brain that it's not all about you, it's also about my heart, my lungs and the rest of me. It's not all about you brain! 
I would wake every morning and saunter out to the front porch and have my smoke. Recently while thinking about quitting, i realized that all i have been doing is satisfying my brains addiction and then regreting what I have been doing to the rest of my body. This became my motivation for quiting. I had to retrain my brains way of thinking. It is not easy and it hasn't been easy, but it has been working. I am working on controlling the conversation my brain is trying to have with me. It is powerful and very persuasive at times, but my willpower and conscious awareness of what it is trying to do is helping me overcome the fight this addiction is putting up. So, 3 days down, hoping for many more! It's going to be a tough battle, but it can be done. I look at all those before me who have been successful and keep in mind I can do that too. My success is directly proportional to my awareness of what my brain is trying to do.

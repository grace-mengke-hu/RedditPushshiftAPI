100 days today! For all of you new quitters IT CAN BE DONE!

I was a pack to a pack and a half smoker for over 20 years. I've quit before for 2 months, 3 months and 10 months but this time feels different.  I think from my previous failures I've learned that I can't have one so when I hear that little voice saying I've earned it I just shrug it off.  This 100 days has not been easy but I've never been more determined to be a non-smoker.  I feel great and have experienced so many positive results from quitting. Running isn't torture-it's enjoyable. My skins feels better. My teeth are white. I don't stink like an ashtray! My sense of taste and smell are back. I've saved over $1,000. I've inspired two other people to quit. And many others.  There really is ZERO benefit to smoking.  I wish I was able to quit years ago.  Just for the money I wasted alone!!  I still have an occasional mental craving but there is no way I'll ever trick myself into going back to smoking.

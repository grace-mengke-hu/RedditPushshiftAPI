I want to smoke.

So I quit cold turkey on June 24th at 5:43 PM. I crushed up my remaining two packs of smokes and threw them away. I was confident that I'd never smoke again and I've felt great the past 49 days or so. 

The last two days however, I've had the little thought creep in my head...*I want a cigarette*. I don't feel like I need it and it isn't a strong urge but it's there. I guess this is sort of the first few hard cravings I've experienced during this quit.

Logically I know that I'm over the physical addiction. I've been so proud of myself and excited about quitting. However since quitting I have been a depressed crying maniac. I cry myself to sleep every night, and already at work today I broke down twice. Not sure if quitting led to depression or they are unrelated but I think this is what's prompting my new thoughts.

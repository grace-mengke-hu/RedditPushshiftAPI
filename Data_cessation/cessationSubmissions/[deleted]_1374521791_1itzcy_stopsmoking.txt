Quit 227 days ago. Recently started craving cigarettes again

I quit December 7, 2012. 

The topic of me quitting came up at a wedding on Friday. Now all I want to do is smoke. I know it will go away with time, but has anyone in a similar situation. Is there anything I can do for myself besides eat to get this to pass? 

Edit: I just looked at my time to quit app and I am at $1,057 saved! I wish I saw that money in my bank account! But I spent that money on making my life better so it's a mute point I guess.

New here and glad for some support.

I'm new here but it is great to see all the support. Officially quit for 40 days. I have tried over and over and over but could never make it past 2-3 days. For some reason this time it stuck. What's helped the most is putting the money I would have spent on cigarettes--everyday--in a jar in plain sight. It's amazing how quickly it adds up. Sometime soon I am going to spend it on something completely irresponsible and feel no guilt. :)

Edit.... so apparently I don't know how to count. By 40 days I meant 38 :-/

Day 7 - I made it over the hump!

was not without warning. in grabbing something I found an old cigarette butt which wasn't quite (finished). It took every ounce of me to throw it away. I actually sat there for a good 10-20 seconds telling myself that I should throw it away.

I did, and I made it back home. **I actually teared a bit writing that**

The driving is killing me. It is probably going to be the worst trigger to overcome after 15 years. It was a little better today than yesterday, which makes me believe that it'll get a lot easier to deal with as time goes on.

Here is to 1 week! And a reminder to all those within the first week. It gets a lot easier to manage after day 5 if you can beat the mental aspect of it into the ground. DO NOT LET THE MONSTER WIN! STAB IT IN THE FACE LIKE THE EVIL COCKROACH IT IS! :D

*yay*

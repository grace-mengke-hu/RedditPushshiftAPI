Day 11 of partner not smoking. Doing okay, but severe boredom is impacting her mentally. What can she do?

She has been doing incredibly well with regards to the cravings, but the problem is the boredom. She used to smoke to fill up the time. We read that doing things like crocheting or knitting were very good for filling up the time, but the problem is, she already did these things, and when she got bored, she'd smoke inbetween, and she gets bored doing these things, including reading or watching youtube. She took up drawing as well, but she still gets bored, and craves a cigarette.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this mental barrier? It's pretty much the only thing now making it difficult for her.

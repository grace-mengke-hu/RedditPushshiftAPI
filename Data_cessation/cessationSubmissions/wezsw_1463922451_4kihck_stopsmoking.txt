19 Days and almost 500 cigarettes not smoked

I just came to check how long how I have been smoke free, and I saw that I'm getting close to a month, I don't even know how that happened but I'm so happy right now. 

When I stopped I expected that I will have some terrible coughs after a week or so because the body will start to get rid of all the shit the smoke has brought in over the years, instead I have had some kind of flu that started after the end of the first week probably and I have been having it untill today. No coughing just a constant runny nose. Any idea how long will that go on.

I'm also keeping an eye on my diet to not gain a lot of weight during these first few months. I removed chocolate and fizzy drinks from my diet completely and replaced them with lots of water and some fruits, they were already causing my shitty skin eczema anyway. 

My only weakness reamins coffee I still drink it but just a single cup a day, and now I can do it without having any craving or even a thought about smoking.

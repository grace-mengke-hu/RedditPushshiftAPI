100 days!!

I don’t have anything really groundbreaking to say about it but I just wanted to share. 

I started drinking 10 years ago and this is the longest I’ve gone without aside from 3 pregnancies. 

When I found a stash of vodka in my garage and drank it all last May, I finally accepted that I can’t moderate. The fear of danger I was putting my kids in being an unfit supervisor for them was enough. I was never an angry or sad drunk, and I never drove drunk, but still- I would pass out in my floor with my kids playing around me. They got old enough to start asking questions about the way I was acting. When I look back I just cringe. 

My life hasn’t magically gotten better but I have lost 10 pounds and the burden of guilt for drinking too much is gone. I am prone to depression and even though I still have guilt from smoking cigarettes it isn’t quite as soul crushing. It’s pretty bad, but I know I can quit because I quit alcohol. So it’s hard to be as down about smoking as I was about alcohol. 

Honestly I don’t care if I ever have another drink. It’s not fun, there’s nothing good about it, cause the way I feel, I’m strong enough I could go down to club or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up cause I’m raising the bar- 

Wait I’m sorry I accidentally turned into Eminem. 

Anyway, if I did it, you can too! I’m happy for every one of you reading this sub because I know if you do keep reading you will get it. Even if it’s not working now. I’ve been subscribed on different accounts for probably 4 years and it never took till now. Don’t give it up! 

Thanks for reading, IWNDWYT!

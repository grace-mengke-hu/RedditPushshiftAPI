Research Study in London

Hi guys,

I am a student at Imperial College London undertaking a study looking at the effects of technology on smoking. We are looking for some volunteers who are current smokers trying to quit.

All we require is that you use a mobile app for a period of 8-10 weeks throughout which we will interview you once a week to see progress and your thoughts on the process. 

We are also looking for some people to take part in a pilot study which is the same thing as above but will only last 1 or 2 weeks.

It will be greatly appreciated and you will, hopefully, also be a part of a process which may change the way people approach quitting smoking. This could be massive with your help!

Thank you so much for your time and wish you the best of luck!

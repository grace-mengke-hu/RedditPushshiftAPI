3 days in!

People kept telling me about how you can only quit smoking if you really want to but, for me at least, it's not really about will but more about discipline. I enjoy smoking cigarettes but I know for sure (4 dead of lung and throat cancer in my family) that it's gonna bite me in the ass sooner or later so might as well stop now instead of telling myself i'll stop whenever.

These last 3 cigarettes are going to rot in that last 6â‚¬80 (9$32) pack I bought last week for as long as possible. The price is gonna get bumped by an additional 20% in 2014 where I live, so that's another motivational factor.

As former smokers, can we handle occasional hookah smoking?

# Hello wonderful people!

&amp;#x200B;

**A little context on my situation:** I stopped smoking cigarettes about a year ago. Had occasional relapses, but nothing major. The way I quit was nicotine replacement therapy through Nicorette. I actually ended up becoming addicted to Nicorette (2mg about once every 1  - 2 hours). However, I quit nicotine cold turkey and it's been almost three months. At this point, I'm like basically over the struggle against my addiction.

**Here is my dilemma.** I love smoking hookah. One of my favorite things to do in college was to hole up in a hookah cafe with my laptop and do work while puffing on a water pipe with my favorite flavor. It was like my little self-care ritual I did once or twice a month. I loved having that alone productive time.

I have ADHD and have been taking Adderall for like 10 years. But I recently quit the medication, as it was causing anxiety. My anxiety problem is gone now, but I struggle with symptoms that affect my productivity. I am in the process of searching for a new job, and it's been hard. For some reason, I have it in my head that visiting a hookah cafe and having some nicotine will give me a boost of focus. I know I have strong enough self-control to not let it make me go back to cigarettes, but I am TERRIFIED that the mere reintroduction of nicotine with trigger the physical withdrawals. The two weeks of withdrawal I went through was hell and I never want to put myself through that. But I know plenty of people who can have occasional cigarettes and can smoke hookah from time to time - and they don't have any withdrawals.

*Now that my psychological addiction is gone, do you think I could get away with treating myself to hookah without withdrawals?*

Sorry for the long-winded post. Any advice or insight would make me so grateful!

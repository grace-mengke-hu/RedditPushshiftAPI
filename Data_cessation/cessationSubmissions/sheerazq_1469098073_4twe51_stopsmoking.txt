Smoking Panel

Hi r/stopsmoking,

 

I posted here a couple of years ago in regards to a study that we were doing, looking into how mobile phone interventions could help those people looking to quit smoking. This project really has taken off and now we are in the midst of being able to create such an intervention!

 

Now we are looking to recruit participants for an on-going usability research study over the next 2 months. This will involve testing prototype apps and filling in an online feedback form. We may occasionally request a telephone call and/or Skype call. You will NOT be required to attend in person. 

 

If you are interested in participating, please complete the questionnaire below. 

[Smoking Panel Screening Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/a/digithera.co/forms/d/1zbiDicY57jnWL8uy2NTe_76cLvewCBq0O1jYG7MLHHo/edit)

 

Details of the study:

* You'll receive a £5 Amazon gift card in appreciation for every month you participate in the panel (not just the questionnaire).

* Maximum of 30 minutes of participation per month from your own home.

 

To participate, you will need to:

* Be willing to sign our Usability Non-Disclosure Agreement.

* Not require assistive devices or software to use a smartphone.

* Allow us to voice record the session.

 

If you would like some more information about anything feel free to message me or post on here!

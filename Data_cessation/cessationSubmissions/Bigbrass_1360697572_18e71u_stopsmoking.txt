Hey everyone!  What was your hardest day, and how did you get through it?

I've found this subreddit to be a wonderful resource for quitting.  5 days isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but for me it's a lifetime.

I want to hear about the hardest day you had to face.  Where in the quitting timeline did it fall?  What made it so hard?  Did you make it through without a scratch?  What did you learn from the experience?

Thank you!

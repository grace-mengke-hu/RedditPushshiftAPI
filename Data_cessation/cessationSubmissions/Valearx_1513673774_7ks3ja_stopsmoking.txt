1 Year!

1 year this morning smoke free! (Naturally dreamed that I’d had a cigarette last night and ruined it at 364 days...). In that time I’ve proposed, got promoted and got married - not saying that the two are necessarily related but I’m choosing to see it that way.

To those still struggling, it gets easier. It really does. Every day is a victory! Stay strong y’all.

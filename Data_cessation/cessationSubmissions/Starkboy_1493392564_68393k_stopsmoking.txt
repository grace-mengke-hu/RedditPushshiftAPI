2 months clean, considering of picking it up again in moderate amounts as the exams approaches.

I quit it. Don't have any cravings now whatsoever, but man do I miss the calming effect of it. I am thinking of picking it up back again for a month while my exams are here. Is it too bad of an idea if I keep my usage moderate?

Stick with it!

I just logged back on to this thread for the first time in ages. I am a few days shy of 2 years since I quit and this subreddit helped me so much through the first days, weeks and months. In fact, I joined reddit just to see my badge increase in numbers.

Well done to anyone on here, whether you are still in the thinking about quitting stages, just quit or been quit for ages. 

It's one of the best things I've done and I hope you think it is for you too.

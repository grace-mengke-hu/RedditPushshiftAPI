Day 1 again!

So my latest attempt last Sunday was dismal. Made it all of 4 1/2 days. I had convinced myself that work was too stressful (had two people fired from work and an uncomfortable meeting about it) and that I hasn't thought it through (basically made the decision with two cigs left in my last pack) and I just wasn't ready. I was miserable and felt physically ill, like I had this pressure in my chest like an anxiety attack. I texted my fiance after that first awful drag after 4 days clean to let him know how disappointed I was with myself and that I would try again.

I got home still in my emotional fog and decided to browse this sub again and kept seeing mentions of Allen Carr's book. Went on Amazon, saw the kindle version, and figured, what the hell? I'll give it a read.

Holy hell you guys! I just put out my last over an hour ago and it feels amazing. That book just cemented in my mind what I kind of already knew, but couldn't put into words. My last quit attempt I was apprehensive and worried 5 seconds after extinguishing my last. Now I feel free from the cycle. I know it will be tough at work again, but now I also know that it will be so much easier.

Here's to all of us making those steps and killing that nicotine monster inside!

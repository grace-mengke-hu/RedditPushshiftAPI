Drinking Tonight, Let's Not Cave...

So when I quit before I wasn't drinking for a whole bunch of reasons - and then I had started smoking again before I started drinking again. So 11 days ago I went out and I smoked, despite not wanting to. Tonight WILL be the first night where I drink and don't smoke. This hurdle will be cleared.

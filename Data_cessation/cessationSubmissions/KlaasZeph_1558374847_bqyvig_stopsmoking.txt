Brother just bought me cigarettes

I told him, "I don't smoke" and threw them out the window...he was both happy that I've quit and sad that he wasted money lol

It's been a slow and hard process. I have slowly restructed myself to absoloutely hating the process, the passed two weeks I have barely managed to smoke a full cigarette. I would have 3-5 drags and throw it away, I ended up just wasting money and well...cigarettes. Last week was also a very stressful period and I barely smoked...I am very greatful to all the motivation in this sub! We will all get there :)

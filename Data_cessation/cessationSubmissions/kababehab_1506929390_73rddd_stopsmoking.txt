I messed up

I messed up, I kept feeling like I was missing out on smoking I quit for 2 months but just had a cigarette and it tasted awful I'm glad to know that I don't like it anymore and that my body doesn't need it , anyone knows the effect of one has for a quitter as in withdrawals, I don't think I'll smoke another one , and should I remove my bAdge ?

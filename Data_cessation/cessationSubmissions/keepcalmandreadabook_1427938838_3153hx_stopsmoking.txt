Taking the Plunge

I've tried quitting maybe 60-80 times literally in the past 6 months. I can't seem to do it, but I do learn from every time I fail... usually. Tonight I'm quitting for good. Checking this sub recently I saw two posts, one about a guy who was worried about something at the doctor and had to get a test (but he was ok) and realized it wasn't even worth it. The guy was the same age as me. I also read another one that said they went for a run and couldn't last and came home and drank water and threw up, and I want to start running and exercising again, which I don't do while smoking, because I'm OCD and feel it's contradictory and beat myself up for it.

Today is April Fool's day. I had to look like an idiot bumming cigarettes from people all day (and lighter, since I "quit again" last night until I got to work today...) and have a few left. **I am quitting tonight because I want to remember that the day I quit was April Fool's day, that I have been the fool since I started smoking at 18 with a black and mild, that I have been the fool for smoking for so long and wasting money, that I have been the fool for ruining my health, possibly giving me a disease that most people have and can't get rid of and are dying because of it. I want to remember that I was the fool on the day I quit, every time.** I haven't smoked consistently but when I do I smoke a pack a day and this can last for months.

I have quit up to 150 days once and fell back into it. Any advice would be appreciated. I've read Allen's book, and it helped a lot, but that was a year ago and although I know all the things he said, I still really struggle with the mental addiction after the physical addiction goes away.

Thanks guys, and please wish me some good inspirational quotes, if you like, those really help me.

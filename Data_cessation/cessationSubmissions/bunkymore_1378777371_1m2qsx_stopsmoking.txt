starting over. damn.

I smoked tonight. I spazzed out, needed "something" and since I'm a recovering alkie/addict, the only "relief" was a cig. I bummed 2 smokes at an AA meeting. Oh well, not my first time starting over. I thought I should be honest, I was gonna just take a day away, but might as well start over with new found resolution to never have a drag no matter what. It did nothing. 
Just in case you were wondering, there was no relief. It was just empty and boring.

After 5 years of not smoking I'm so tempted to buy a pack

So I had smoked for about five years, thought about quitting a lot and finally did it and haven't really smoked past 5 years. Until this month when I smoked some joints mixed with rolling tobacco and I'm soo tempted to just buy a pack of rolling tobacco and indulge. Flavored rolling tobacco was always my favorite, and now I smell it around the town almost every day and after those few joints it's so tempting to get back into it. The only deterrent really is that I have been getting into running and cycling recently, but when I see lycra-clad road warriors stop their ride for a smoke and it seems like it doesn't even matter.

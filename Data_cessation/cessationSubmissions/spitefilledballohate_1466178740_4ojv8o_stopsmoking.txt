relapsed

Last night I was celebrating quitting one job and the eventual beginning of my new job. I had too much to drink, slipped up, bought some cigarettes and smoked two. Not craving any today. What do I do with the rest of them? I feel like it's ok to hang on to them in case I find myself in that situation again but it feels like I'm just giving myself a reason to have it happen again. Throwing them away seems a waste. I guess I could give them to someone else that smokes. I do feel bad about slipping up I was doing well for about a week. I know it sounds weird but sometimes I feel like if I have them it's easier to not smoke but it might be my brain playing tricks.

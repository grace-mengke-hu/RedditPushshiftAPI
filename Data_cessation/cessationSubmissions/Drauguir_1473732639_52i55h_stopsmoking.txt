1 year of freedom

I just wanted to say: thank you for all the support I got, especially the first 2 months trying to quit. I hope you all the best. With willpower EVERYTHING is possible, just remember that.

I dedicate this smoke-free year to all of you. 
It gets easier, I promise. Hang in there and harden the f. up! You are all warriors!

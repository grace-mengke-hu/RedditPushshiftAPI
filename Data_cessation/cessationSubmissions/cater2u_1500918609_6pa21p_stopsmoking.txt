am i the only one where cigs made me hungry? now that i quit, i have absolutely no appetite.

whenever i would smoke, i would usually eat right after so i would always be hungry when i smoke. even when i was full, i would have one and get hungry again. i quit and now i have no appetite. is this common? i know it's more common for people to gain weight, but i guess i'm going to lose?

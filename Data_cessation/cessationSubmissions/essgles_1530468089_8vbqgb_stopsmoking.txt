Wisdom please

It's summer and boiling hot. It's the end of a long day/week. I met up with my ex recently and it kind of bummed me out. 

Despite being nearly 7 weeks quit cold turkey (my longest ever quit!) I'm really struggling to fight these triggers and resist an urge to smoke I've been fighting all day. 

Just looking for some support and wisdom on this! Currently sucking on a (nicotine free) e-cig and trying to remember smoking is not going to make any of this better and that the sunshine is just a trigger due to habitual summer smoking!!

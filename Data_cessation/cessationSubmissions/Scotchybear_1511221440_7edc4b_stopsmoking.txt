Severe panic attacks after quitting.

I have quit smoking. I'm on day 4 and today and yesterday I've been having ridiculously severe panic attacks.

The one yesterday occurred at work and I had to call my boss to come talk to me. She was actually very understanding! 

But. My general anxiety level and panic attack rate has skyrocketed. And I almost feel depersonalization kicks in occasionally.

Anyone have any advice and if this is normal? I have the nicotine gum and it helps a tiny bit but sometimes it's just so overwhelming I don't know how to respond.

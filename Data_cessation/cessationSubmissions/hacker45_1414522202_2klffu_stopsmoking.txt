Depressed and almost suicidal.

I've quit smoking yesterday, it's not my first attempt, I've quit before for over six months. The past few times I've tried to quit, after a few days I get severely depressed. Right now I'm sitting at home, crying, thinking about killing myself and how my life is terrible(it is, but at least when I smoke I can kinda suffer quietly). I've had something close to depression, maybe, for a few years now, and I feel terrible, tired and unhealthy when I smoke, but my quitting attempts only make me more miserable to the point I'm afraid I'll either ruin my life by doing something rash or end it. It sucks. Maybe I should quit my new job, I've only been there 2 months but I hate that place. Maybe it's just withdrawal.

I don't even know what my point was typing all this, fuck it.

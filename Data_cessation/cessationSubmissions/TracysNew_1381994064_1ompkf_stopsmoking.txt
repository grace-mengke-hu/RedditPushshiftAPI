2 days in and I want to club myself over the head

A friend once told me: "You're always going to want another cigarette."

Another friend: "Cold turkey. It's the only way."

I've availed myself of a situation where, for about two weeks, I can't just crack and run around the corner to buy a pack. I keep on reminding myself: I can't afford to do this; I want to live as long as possible; I don't want to die of something horrible like emphysema or cancer; I want to have a life and a family, and I want it to be happy and healthy, and I owe it to the people I love to take care of myself.

Will it really be that hard to just...not buy the damn stuff? If I slip and bum one at a party or bar, will I slip back into miserable ways?

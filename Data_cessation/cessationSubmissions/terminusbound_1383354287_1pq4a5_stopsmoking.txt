I need some help!!!!!!

Last Sunday night I had my last smoke and I'm freaking out about this weekend. I really don't/do want to buy a pack tonight and smoke this weekend and then give it another go on monday but I also am thinking, it will be a huge accomplishment if I can survive my first weekend. Mostly work has been keeping me busy enough to not think about it but now I have two whole days to myself!!

The mind games are telling me, "well you could just have one last going away type party this weekend."

AWWWWW HELP!!! Is it really that bad if I just have one last weekend, I mean, I really did quit spur of the moment anyhow. Maybe I could feel stronger if I planned out my last cig?

Edit: Thanks, I'll think about it.

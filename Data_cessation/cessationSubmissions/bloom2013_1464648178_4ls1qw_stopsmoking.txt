What has (so far) worked for me. May be useful for those starting their quit.

The app I've been using - which I thoroughly recommend - sends me "missions" every day and today's was to make a list of what has worked so far and share it. Maybe someone will find something useful here (or even something counter productive that you could warn people agains!).

**First few days**

- Indulging *every* craving that wasn't smoking so as to concentrate the full force of my will power on the one task at hand (I did this for two weeks - I mean I indulged in *everything*, from chocolate to sex and weed, not exercising and even slacking off on work).
- Chewing on a lollipop stick.
- Taking deep breaths to see how much better my lungs feel (this was noticeable from about day three).
- Pacing and cursing freely to deal with cravings.
- Making my life as pleasant as possible (I saved the last season of GoT to binge watch, I re-read my favourite novel, I made myself a dopamine-boosting playlist, etc).
- Doing everything I enjoy, even drinking, almost from the get go to make myself realise that cigarettes are not the be all and end all of fun.
- That said, I locked myself in for the first 72 hours, and started off drinking by myself and only when the link between beer and smoking was broken, did I venture to drink first with non-smokers and then with actual smokers. This particular piece of advice I cannot recommend enough.

**This past week:**

- Checking my stats and following the missions on my [Smoke Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smoke-free-quit-smoking-now/id577767592?mt=8) app (really recommend the full version, well worth the fee!).
- Checking in often and reading posts here regularly.
- Realising that neither cold turkey nor NRT would work without working on my 'mindset'.
- Going trough the videos, articles and ebooks in [WhyQuit](http://whyquit.com/) (way better than Allen Carr, in my opinion).
- Seeing new situations as 'triggers' which you can disarm: first exposure to *anything* is difficult, but if you go through it it means you 'broke' the link between that activity/thing/person/emotion and smoking, so you can relish in the tiny victory. Second and third exposures will be so much easier to deal with and eventually the link will be broken - I no longer want a cigarette when I wake up, for example (unthinkable!).
- Playing a [smoking cessation hypnosis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcosBFS7lA8) every night.
- Cutting back on the relentless indulging of every whim *gradually*.
- Exercising.
- Not being too hard on myself for being irritable or depressed - I tell myself that even though it's gotten way easier in many respects, that doesn't mean I'm over it and that quitting is a long, and at times turbulent process.
- This is probably very ill-advised, but I've been sitting next to smokers at parties because I find the smell of smoke still soothes me and calms me, I feel I miss it more if I don't smell it. I can't explain how or why but I haven't once been tempted to have a puff in this particular situation. 

**Most important of all, [The Golden Rule](http://whyquit.com/FFN/chapters/FFN_02_Law.pdf)**: remembering constantly that, for me, one puff means going back to two packs a day. There's no way round it. If I have a craving I acknowledge I want one cigarette, but not all the others that come with it. 

So there goes my two cents! I'm still early stages so don't take this as "advice", it's just my experience so far. Good luck everyone!

Three days,three nightmares

I'm just gonna share some of the crazy dreams I had,feel free to join in too.

Day1:I'm chilling on the street when im approached by two cops,one male one female.The male one asks me if i would like to have a cigarette and im like no im a non smoker.He smirks and looks at his female companion and asks are you sure?i reply with yes im 100% sure and he says yeah thats what they all say,put your hands in front where i can see them and than proceeds to arrest me.as we are walking towards the police station i started screaming im a non smoker im a non smoker and it got louder and louder...I woke up sweaty and with a great feeling of guilt and shame but once i realized everything was just a dream i carried on with the day.

Day2:This isnt really a nightmare but it was still scary.Im on a crowded bus station,everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and having fun and everyone(except for me) had a ciggarete in his/her mouth and it seemed like as they dragged another puff they would become happier and happier.i approached a few and asked them if they could give me one but they couldnt hear me.I repeated my request but this time louder and still nobody gave a shit about me.Then i just woke up.

Day3(the worst one by far):I'm sitting on a bench with my best friend,he has been my friend for as long as i can remember.He offers me a cigarrete and i say thank you and i light up.He asks me dude didnt you like quit smoking or something?And i replied cmmon man stop being retarded i would never quit this shit while laughing.But something inside of me didnt feel very right and it was like my body got seperated into two entities:one which was me(the non smoker) and the guy sitting with my best friend(the smoker).I couldnt do anything but watch myself getting intoxicated with that filth and i was starting to get really ashamed of what i did.i quit for 3 days and than i relapsed just like that?NO NO NO NO it started screaming inside of me.I started crying and yelling as loud as i could:NO IM NOT A SMOKER IM SORRY I DID THIS.Then i woke up,I have never seen so much sweat in my life it was literally raining down from me.It was 3am at that point so as soon as i got changed i started sleeping again but i had this same dream for about 100 times but everytime my friend offers me one i replied No im a non smoker,scary shit.

I'm just glad I quit and I'm happy to recognize what dangerous things a poison can do to your body while in withdrawal mode.Smoking a ciggarete as of now would be like the death toll for me.

Almost 2 months!

I've already noticed that I can breathe easier, taste everything (OMG food is delicious), and smell better.  I have no desire at all to smoke another cigarette, but I am wondering one thing...

Why am I not physically revolted by cigarettes?  I hear a lot of stories on here from people who just retch at the smell of one, and to be completely honest, I really don't mind being around them, and actually (blasphemously, I feel) enjoy the smell of one that is nearby occasionally.  

Most of the time, I just tune it out though.  

IN NO WAY DO I FEEL THAT ENJOYING THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL CIGARETTE SMELL IS INFLUENCING ME TO WANT TO SMOKE AGAIN, but I still feel like I should feel differently about it.

I have a lot of friends who smoke, and unless I want to be fairly lonely, I will keep hanging out with them, so the nearby cigarette smoke is almost inevitable.

Thoughts?

I've relapsed after 2 months without cigs, due to a stressful time in which I attempted suicide twice in one week. need advice.

I did not quit cold turkey, but through vaping. I have a history of depression, schizophrenaa, and several types of addiction problems. I'm not going to tell a long essay about what happened. Basically my parents came back from a one week vacation, already knowing about my painkiller overdose (my first attempt) due to falling out with my best friend, whilst extremely drunk.

But to be thourough, my mum searched through everything, found an embty weed bag, empty valium packs, and more.

This is probably at eeast the 10th time this has happened, so I understand their decision. They confiscated and intend to sell anything that could give me access to drugs, about 3 devices in total.

Losing my main methods of distraction hit me hard, and the intense arguing led to me freaking out in a panic attack, running away, when I reached a bssy road I threw myself in front of a bus. I know how selfish this action was looking back on it, I just was in an almost delirious state of mind. Luckily the driver must've noticed my intent, as the paramedkc told me it hit me at 10mph so they must have slammed the brakes.

Anyway, sicce the first attempt, I have smoked at least 5 cigs a day, and the vape doesn't seem to calm me down. I would appreciate any advice and support you guys can provide. Thank you.

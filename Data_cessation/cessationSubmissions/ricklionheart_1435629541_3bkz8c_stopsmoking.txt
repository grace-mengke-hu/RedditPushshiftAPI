What's the smoking culture in your city/community? How were you exposed to smoking?

I just realized that only one person where I work smokes, two in my family (I'm not close) and no one in my circle of friends. I just realized I was the only smoker in several of my social circles.

Going back years, even in the university I was the only one of my friends that smoked.

As a matter of fact, I don't  think smoking was ever around me a lot, either growing up, during my teen years, in colleger or after.

This is a great realization since it wasn't peer pressure or a tobbaco culture that I was exposed to. I tried it, loved it, became a smoker that loved all tobbaco products and even though I quit, I'll never stop being one and have to refrain from even one.

Looking back trying to realize how much exposure I got in my family and community has been a good mental exercise for my every day fight, even after a year.

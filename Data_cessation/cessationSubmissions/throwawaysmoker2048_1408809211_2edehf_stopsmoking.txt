Looking for advice on replacement activities for smoking at work

I'm thinking about quitting and could use some advice. There are really only two occasions where I smoke anymore: if I'm out drinking with friends, and while at work. While I can use some constraint when out with friends (most of my friends don't smoke), the harder to give up is smoking at work. I work a stressful job where I'm managing several projects. I like a smoke at the beginning of the day to help organize my thoughts and get in the headspace for work, and once at the end of the day to decompress. I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas on activities I could use aside from smoking? Ideally nothing longer than 5 minutes, and that can be relaxing and yet allow for thinking and focusing on something? I've tried tossing a baseball around, and while that's stress relieving, I can't really think straight either. Any advice? Thanks.

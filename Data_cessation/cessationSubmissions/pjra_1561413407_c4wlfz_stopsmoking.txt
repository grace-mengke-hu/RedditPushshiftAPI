14 days...

Hi guys, today was my 14th day without smoking. I had 3 cravings in this time, I have been super fine. But today I saw a friend I hadn’t see in a long time, and very conscious about my decision - I had a cigarette.

It wasn’t a cigarette that came from me having anxiety, or like I’m going to kill someone if I don’t smoke this. 

It was a conscious decision of “Im having this one, and I won’t have more. I don’t need it.” 

It was a controlled cigarette, here I am again, not wanting to smoke.

I decided not to start my time again in the app. Should I restart the time? 
I don’t want to smoke. I felt very ashamed after, but at the same time I’m very proud of how far I’ve come. 

Don’t know if I should take it like big mistake and get back to 0....

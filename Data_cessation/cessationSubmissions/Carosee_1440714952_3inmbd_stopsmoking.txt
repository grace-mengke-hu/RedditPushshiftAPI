Starting today

Today is a Thursday afternoon and I decided to throw out the new pack I bought this morning. I'm 26 and have been struggling with anxiety a lot lately, and I think a big part of it is how unhealthy I feel because of the cigarettes. 

So I'm going cold turkey. My boyfriend and I are going camping this weekend and I thought being outside and being active would be great for distracting myself from withdrawal. Does that sound like a good idea? Or am I setting myself up to ruin the trip with my misery? I've been smoking for about 8 years and have never really quit for more than a few days at a time so I don't know what I'm in for. I just can't feel this gross and unhealthy anymore.

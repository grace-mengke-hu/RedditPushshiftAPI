Guess my quit will have to start again in a couple of days.

So, I was ready,  I quit for two days. I definitely felt cravings, but I felt strong and let them pass.  My husband bought a pack, and said this wasn't up for discussion,  to wait until after the holiday.  I didn't realize that I was being a bitch. That said, my husband and I don't usually get to see each other except for a few hours a week. We work opposite shifts and this holiday weekend is an exception. This hasn't happened well over 10 years that we get to spend days together. So for now, I want us to get along, and the quit will be Monday night. Then we're right back to where we never see each other and I won't on his nerves. I know that can do this, and I  will.

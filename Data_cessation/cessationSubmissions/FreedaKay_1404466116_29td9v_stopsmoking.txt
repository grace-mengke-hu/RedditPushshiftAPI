I quit smoking as of yesterday. It was my birthday present to myself.

I've been smoking since I was 15 years old and a year ago I decided I wanted to join the military but held off on it because I had a nasty addiction to menthol's :/ It's been a long 4 years but I gotta start somewhere. Happy Birthday to me and wish me luck!

Anger issues...

Hey everyone - long time lurker, first time poster, and thank you for the tremendous support I've gotten just by reading your posts!

Anyway - I just stopped smoking (again) the 4th of January, and since day 4 or 5 I've hardly had any cravings. 

However, my problem is this - despite me being almost an entire month smoke free, I still have horrible anger issues. It feels like I loose control over even the slightest matters, no matter who or what.

An example - this morning I was preparing to go out with my daughter and gf, when a coat fell out of the closet. I was annoyed and picked it up and put it in it's place. Then it fell out again. And a third time. And I just felt like tearing the closet down. 

Stupid stuff like this causes me to explode. Trivial stuff. And it is really starting to bother me, my loved ones, colleagues and friends.

Any suggestions what to do - apart from just digging myself down in the yard and stay there for a couple of weeks? Or just someone who had it the same way, who can tell me that it passes?

Thanks in advance =)

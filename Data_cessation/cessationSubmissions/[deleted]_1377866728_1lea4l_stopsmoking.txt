Day 1: First Attempt to Quit

I started about 4 years ago, and this is my first real attempt at quitting. I'm 24 and my mother doesn't know that I've smoked the past few years. This weekend, we're going camping together, so there's pretty much no way to sneak one in, and I'm sick of lying, coughing, and killing myself.

I'm sure I'll be back to this sub, but let me just say on day 1 that reading through the posts here have helped me already. I feel like I know what to expect now, and I have a group of people who've been through this. I believe I can do it, and I want to do it.

Now for the hard part.

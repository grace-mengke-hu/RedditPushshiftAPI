A little after my 1 year.

I was out camping in West Virginia when my one year came up. Talked to one of my friends and he is going to try to stop smoking now too. I also quit chewing. It feels amazing having 1 year down. A big shout out and thanks to this sub. And keep it up to my fellow quitters!!!

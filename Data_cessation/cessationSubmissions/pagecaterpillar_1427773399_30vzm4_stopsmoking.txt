Abandonment issues and wtf do I do with my hands!

I have a group of loved ones who all smoke. At first they all stayed away to smoke until I realized that behavior made me feel awful. It felt like I was missing out. However it doesn't bother me when they light up next to me. anyone notice anything similar.  And seriously what do I do with my hands now

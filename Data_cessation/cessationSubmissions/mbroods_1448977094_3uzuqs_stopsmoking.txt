Not waiting for the big moment

I've been smoking for the last four years and have been trying to quit for the last three. I've quit for a few months at a time, but always end up back again. I currently live in Beirut, where nearly everyone smokes- at bars, at home, at work- and it's been hard to motivate myself to quit. I'm on day six without smoking- through the worst days/nights- but I know I'm going to need help to quit permanently. I always get back on after a few weeks/months by telling myself (usually when drinking) that the occasional social cigarette is fine. As of last week, I was smoking 2-6 cigarettes a day- few enough to convince myself that it wasn't a big deal. And, really, 2-6 cigarettes are not a big deal- the big deal thing is the cumulative future- the days, weeks, months, years of smoking, with no reason to decide that I've finally had enough. 

So here I go again. Trying to focus on just getting through today.

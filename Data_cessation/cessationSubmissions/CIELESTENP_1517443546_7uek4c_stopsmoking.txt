Almost a month in, and I still have a sore throat upon awakeing/shortness of breath before going to bed

taste and coughness definetively got better, cravings are completely gone, but yet I still feel like I'm not as healthy as I should be. I mean, I'm very often worried about my health, no matter how mundane my symptoms can be. 

Anyway, I'm just asking what was your first month like, in terms of health improvement. I want to make sure it's because of smoking side effects, rather than being really sick

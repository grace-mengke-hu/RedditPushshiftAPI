Trying to quit - how long before I stop tasting/smelling like cigarettes?

Hey Guys,
Anybody know how long it will take after I quit for my breath and mouth to stop smelling/tasting like cigarettes? I've been doing coconut oil pulling, which helps with the mouth, but not the lungs. 

I have someone I want to make out with a lot, but I need to be a non-smoker before it happens. Quitting anyway, this is just an extra motivator. Anyway, let me know!

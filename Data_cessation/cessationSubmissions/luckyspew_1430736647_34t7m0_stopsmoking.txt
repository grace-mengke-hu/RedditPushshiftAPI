Relapsed after 11 days . I'm back in the prison .

last 10 days were  easy but today , my mind had just been playing tricks on me .  .It was coming up with these pretty creative excuses to get me off the wagon and  I wanted to see what it feels like to be smoking . And I like a fucking idiot gave in . What the fuck did I do that for . That was so stupid . But I'm starting over right back again . Day 1 starting again  . Feel horribly stupid . Did this happen to any of you guys? I'm sure it did . What a stupid question . But please share your stories of triumph .

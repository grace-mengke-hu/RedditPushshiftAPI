Feeling alone

I feel that I encounter so many triggers that I've isolated myself a bit. Most of my friends are cigarette smokers so we haven't been hanging out. My favorite coffee shop I used to sit outside and chain smoke while drinking coffee and reading a good book. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss those moments so I've stopped going there. Even outside the library at school (a smoking area) was a way I met new people while taking a break from studying.

All in all I'm feeling worse for wear. Logically I know that I've done myself a favor by quitting but emotionally I feel so lonely. Can anyone relate to this? Do I just not know how to make friends when it's not centered around smoking or something?

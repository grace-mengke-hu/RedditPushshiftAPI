I'm resetting my badge after 824 days smoke free.

Hey guys,

I've decided to take a big step today, and I reset my badge after 2 and a half years being smoke free.

I can honestly say I didn't have any temptation to smoke after the first month and actively thought I was done. Out of the blue, I bummed a cigarette while having a few drinks with a new girl I met. I thought I was in control and I wasn't, I'm back to square one. 

I'm going through a tough time with a long term break up and living and working alone has taken its toll. It's going to be harder than ever to quit but if I've done it once, I can do it again, but I could really use some support and encouragement from everyone.

Let this be a reminder, NEVER slip up, always keep your wits about you, I honestly never though this would happen again and I'm bitterly disappointed in myself. It's taken a lot of courage for me to do this. I'm not going to bury my head in the sand anymore. I'm really sorry to everyone here as I thought I was leading by example. Sorry guys.

10 Days Quit And Some Simple Milestones

I made it to double digit days! I'm still puttering along in heck week. I've already noticed a few improvements from quitting. It weird to brag about milestones I once never thought about and took for granted.

1.) My gum line stop receding and grew back. For the past two years I was already noticing the impact smoking was causing my gums. I was showing the signs of gum disease with my gums receding, the appearance of black in between my teeth, and losing their pink/red color. Now that's been completely reversed.

2.) I can smell things again! This hasn't been an enjoyable milestone for my dog. Poor lil' doggie had to suffer a bath. 

3.) My appetite has returned and I can taste food again. 

4.) I haven't been watching my money like a hawk. As a matter of fact it's a good feeling to not think about money. It's been years since I've gone days without spending any money.

5.) My perspective of time has changed. I don't count the hours anymore. I've found myself not noticing the time for hours and left puzzled when I realized the hours had passed. My sense of time is no longer warped.

6.) Most of my anxiety and depression is gone. I was never at a clinical level with either, but I'm loving how quiet my mind has become. I don't have debbie downer moments anymore. I'm also getting more patience about feeling annoyed or frustrated. I'm able to catch myself before my emotions run amok.

7.) My house is cleaner. I wasn't a slob or anything. I just used to procrastinate doing the dishes or taking out the trash. Now I get little spurts of energy throughout the day where I'll tidy up just because.

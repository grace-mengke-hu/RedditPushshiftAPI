why am I not getting morning wood?

I quitted regular smoke but I am still vaping a lot.

I am worried about my health that I have not had a morning wood for like last 5 years or so, maybe I can count the days I woke up with morning wood less than 10.

I don't work out currently, but I had no problem with erection when in need. Is this normal? or is this something to do with nicotine?

Just celebrated 2 weeks as a non smoker!

There are good and bad days, like most things, but I'm staying strong. I did just have a strange dream last night that I wanted a cigarette so badly I stole one. I felt so guilty about the whole thing that I ended up not smoking it even in my dream and just kept it with me as a reminder of what I've already gone through and as a test of my own willpower. 

No matter what happens today, I will remain a non smoker.

Planning on quitting after wisdom tooth extraction

Hi guys! I'm 23 and have been a smoker for 10 years. I just found out I have to get my wisdom teeth out and I'm extremely anxious because I've never gone under anesthesia before. I'm also nervous because I am told I need to not smoke for 5 days. Now I have never tried quitting before because I know I'll struggle a lot, and I can't imagine being a nonsmoker having started at such a young age.. but I want to quit. 

I figure since I have to go five days I might as well try to quit then. I am worried about how my body is going to react to nicotine withdrawal on top of my mouth healing. I am considering the patch but I've heard about some bad reactions to it so I basically just want to go cold turkey..

Does anyone have any experiences with This? Thanks guys and congrats on quitting!

Quitting vaping with nicotine gum?

So I've been smoke free for a long time thanks to e-cigarettes. My problem is that I'm finding it impossible to quit vaping and I've been told to quit by my dentist because I've got gum disease and nicotine itself aggravates gum disease. I've tried and failed going cold turkey many times. I've tried using Allen Carr's book and failed too. I'm wondering does anyone have any experience quitting vaping using nicotine gum? Am I being naive in thinking that switching from one nicotine replacement to another will help me? Won't I still have to go through the same withdrawals after the 12 weeks I'm planning on giving myself with nicotine gum? Thank you

Went to the doctor today. If I don't stop smoking Il be dead before 60

Hey all. I went to the doctor today because of a cracked rib, and left with emphysema. Apparently my lungs are super-ultra weak and Iv already done irreparable damage. 

Im 19, Iv been smoking cigarettes for 2 year and smoking pot for 7.

I feel like Iv thrown my life away.

I cut WAY back but my first week, overall, was a failure. Looking for info on "relapsing"

I do really well at first, same goes for drinking less, eating better and exercise. But after years of constant "rubber-banding" I'd like to understand why my motivation suddenly turns to shit and I binge on booze/cigs/crap food. 

I want to unlearn this bullshit. I want to hit "day 3" and think: god damn it I made it through two days I can go another without a drink/cig. And keep the motivation through day 4, 5, 100!

So frustrated right now.  I see the problem. I know, logically, what needs to be done.  But I just keep doing it. :/

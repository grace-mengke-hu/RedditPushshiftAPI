It was like autopilot..

Yesterday, I was 10 days smoke free and I don't know what came over me, but it was like autopilot. I went to the gas station, bought a pack, went home and smoked 2. 
It didn't feel the same, though. It tasted gross, it made my heartbeat skyrocket, and made me sick to my stomach.
So, I called the bf told him what happened and drowned the rest of the pack and threw them out.

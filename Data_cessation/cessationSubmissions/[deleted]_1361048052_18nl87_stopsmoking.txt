Decided to quit today

I just smoked my last cigarette maybe 15 minutes ago, and decided that I should make a serious effort to quit. I started smoking socially while drinking, and at first I didn't enjoy it too much, but things quickly escalated and I got up to about half a pack a day.

Smoking has caught up to me in the 9 month time I've smoked, and I'm not much of a fan of being out of breath and having yellowed teeth. So here's to quitting, hopefully I can stay strong and endure the cravings that will inevitably come.

For all those trying to quit.

When I quit smoking I used nicorette gum as a quitting aid. Even with using the gum, it was still though. I thought I would have these cravings for the rest of my life. I thought once a smoker always a smoker. I thought wrong.

It's been nine months since I quit smoking, and I can't recall the last time I had a craving. I've forgotten I even used to be a smoker, that's how far it is gone from my life. I can even walk past someone smoking with no problem at all.

If I can quit, I know you can too.

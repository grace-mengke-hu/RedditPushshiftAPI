Four years and ~$12,000 later, I'm done with smoking for good. Any helpful advice/support appreciated.

I've tried to quit a few times now, and at the most made it 9 days. I've read Carr, and while the main themes definitely help, it didn't work the wonders I was expecting. I've tried e-cigs and nicorette, but neither made much of a difference. The difference is now I don't have enough money to keep buying smokes, whereas back then I was waiting tables and coming home with cash every night. I'm going to go out tomorrow and buy a health club membership, and really do this thing right. Wish me luck!

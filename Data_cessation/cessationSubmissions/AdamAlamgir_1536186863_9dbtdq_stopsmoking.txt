Anger

I’ve been getting angrier everyday and I really just want a cig to calm me down. I’m still resisting it but for some reason it feels like it’s not worth it. Is this normal? Because I’ve stopped since Sunday which is almost 4 days and I don’t feel any “benefits” other people apparently feel/see.

Can we talk about rewards? I just realized everything I've been rewarding myself with is killing me.

Cigarettes, booze, food. 

I've been using these three things to get through the past sixteen years of my life and I Have no clue how to find new rewards for living. 

Day three here. Because I do not smoke, I do not drink. This is good because I was pretty much a functional alcoholic anyway. So, three days of no smoking and no wine means I've been rewarding myself and coping by eating everything.

I am stopping this now before it gets out of hand and wanted to make a little list of rewards. Or coping mechanisms that are pleasurable. Yet, take away wine, ciggs and guilty pleasure foods and I CANNOT THINK OF A LITERAL THING that my mind will accept. 

Help.

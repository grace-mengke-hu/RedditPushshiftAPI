Can I Ever Smoke Hooka Or A Cigar Again?

My dad smoked for about the same time as me, and he occasionally smokes cigars now, but never cigarettes. I always enjoyed hooka with friends, and when smoking weed tobacco goes in the joint sometimes. Is it advisable to ever try smoking tobacco in those forms ever again?

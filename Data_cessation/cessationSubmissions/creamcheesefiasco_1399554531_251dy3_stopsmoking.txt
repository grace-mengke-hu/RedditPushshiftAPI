1 Week: Doing Good

I'm a week into my new non-smoking lifestyle and it's going well. There have been some ups and downs, especially on day 3 and day 4 where I had several "nic fits." Mornings are still a bit challenging, but yesterday I decided to double up my NRT in the morning (I use the Nicorette QuickMist and you can do two mists instead of one, if needed). Two mists are definitely working better than one. I don't know why I didn't think of doubling up before because when I was smoking, I normally had two or three morning smokes, so it makes sense that one spray (equivalent to one smoke) wasn't cutting it.

If you can find it, I definitely recommend the QuickMist as a good NRT solution. It works almost instantly (less than a minute), so it's perfect for overcoming cravings fast. It is gross and it will take you a couple of days to get over the disgusting side effects (intense burping), but you will get used to it. So if you've tried the gum or lozenge before and it didn't work well, try the QuickMist. 

The packaging says you can take one or two sprays to replace every cigarette, but I don't feel like I need it that frequently. I only take it 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I replace a spray with a Nicorette gum, just for a change of pace (i.e., to replace my evening "boredom" cigarette while watching TV). 

In conjunction with *acceptance* over *repression* for treating cravings, I'm doing a good job with quitting this time around. It's been my most successful effort to date! And I'm certain it'll be my last. :D

Six weeks!

Six weeks quit, checking in because I can. I feel good, but the "fun" of quitting in wearing off. Luckily cravings have been easy to ignore. I still dream of smoking every other night.

After the 1 month mark I stopped treating cravings and boredom with food. My weight hasn't moved for the last week so now I need to work on losing the 10lbs I gained since quitting. 

I smell better
I breathe better
I fuck better
I sleep better
I have more money
I have more time
I have more confidence
I have more self respect

Quitting has been worth it. I hope I never go back.

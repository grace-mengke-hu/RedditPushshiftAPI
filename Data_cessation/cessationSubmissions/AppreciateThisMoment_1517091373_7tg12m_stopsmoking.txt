Done after relapse

Had a good run smokefree last year- the longest in my life after 15 years of struggling with it. I attribute my success at that time to this wonderful community as well as completely revamping my lifestyle in regards to physical activity and hobbies. Felt so amazing during all that. Winter came and a moment of weakness led to a relapse that quickly snowballed into a return to fullblown addiction. Return of headaches and anxiety attacks, feeling like crap all too often and experiencing a drop in quality of sleep and overall energy levels that I had dealt with for way too many years prior. Overall I'm thankful that at least the backslide wasn't complete in all facets, that I still maintained a drive for self-improvement and general positive outlook on things, have picked up some good habits along the way- it's just that I was once again saddled with the financial, emotional, and physical parasite that is smoking and as a cornerstone of my ideal lifestyle, it completely undermines sustainable well being and growth. Stayed away from this community since then, probably out of some weird embarressment for my setback and out of nonsensical fear of addressing the uncomfortable phase that I'd inevitably need to pass through. Getting serious about it again- posting this just for anyone who has dealt with it in their own life or as a reminder to those along the way that complacency in success can lead to being right back in a hole again. Wishing everyone the best and hope all is great over in your world, with whatever you're doing and wherever you happen to be. Reset my badge and excited to drop these pointless chains again. Will be checking in periodically and as always, this community rocks:)

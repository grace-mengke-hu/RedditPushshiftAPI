4 days since my last one, I'm noticing some bad side effects.

Hello!  I've been smoking for the better part of the past 20 years, and last Friday was my quit date.  I did a month of weekly acupuncture sessions to prepare for this, so the withdrawal isn't getting to me too bad.  There's a couple of issues I'm noticing that are making things difficult.

After day one my sense of smell became EXTREMELY sensitive.  I remember faintly having a strong sense of smell, but it seems like it's come back with a vengeance.  I smell EVERYTHING, like a damn bloodhound, and everything smells HORRID.  When my wife and I were walking downtown, I asked her what she smelled.  She replied with the pizza place next to us and bus exhaust.  I told her I smelled bus exhaust, beer, beer vomit, homeless BO, urine, tire rubber, hot asphalt, and a hint of pizza.  I don't know how much of the reek I can take.  I've cleaned the bathrooms in my house twice because they stink so much, but I can still smell the toilet over my meal.  Is this going to back off over time?  

I'm also getting feelings of despair with this.  Every time I think of it, I count it as "Four days down, just the rest of my life to go!" This struggle to not smoke isn't overwhelming, but it is constant.  I feel like I'm fighting a war that won't be over until my heart stops.  Does this feeling go away over time?

I know that if I break down and have one it will just start the whole process over again, and that's the main thing keeping me from lighting up.  But this stuff is going to continue, I may just have to go back to it and give up any thoughts of quitting.

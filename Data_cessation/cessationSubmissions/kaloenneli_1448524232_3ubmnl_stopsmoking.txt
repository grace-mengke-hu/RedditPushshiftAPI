Tell me your questions/worries/thoughts

So I started to make a blog which should help people quit smoking (like I did about 2 years ago). 
I could write about pretty much everything but I don't think that will actually help people to quit.
So thought my fellow /stopsmokers might have questions or worries or anything else they would love to read about.
Post them here and I will (promise) write about it.
I hope you guys don't think this is some kind of cheap marketing trick to promote my blog. And as long as people don't want to see my posts I will keep the link for myself.

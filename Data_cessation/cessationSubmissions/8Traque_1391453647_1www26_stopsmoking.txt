2 Years!

I've made it 730 days and still going strong!

A lot has happened in these two years... We've bought a house, I've lost my job and, subsequently, started my own (moderately) successful business... I've watched my two year old toddler turn into a beautiful little girl preparing for kindergarten.  I've also watched my mother fight a losing battle against lung cancer each and every day, and watch as my 11 year old son battles with his Aspergers and other physical limitations on a daily basis.

It gets easier to look at the individual days or weeks I've gone without smoking.  But, at some point, it is so wonderful to see that they don't pile up that way anymore.  These days, I look back and measure it all in life experiences.  Memories, good and bad, are made to be lived.  

Every cigarette I took was robbing me of memories yet to be lived.

I don't know what tomorrow holds, but as for today, I know I'm still able to say "no" to those smokes- and that feels pretty fucking awesome!

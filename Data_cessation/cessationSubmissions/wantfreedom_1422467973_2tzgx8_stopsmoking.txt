Just over 3 weeks!

So I decided to request a badge.  It was pretty touch and go and I still get cravings, but I've made it past some pretty tough humps.  I've gone drinking about 3 or 4 times since and resisted cigarettes without too much issue.  My worst triggers are when I'm working on my bikes or writing, especially at the end after I'm finished with my work.

This is probably my 4th or 5th serious attempt at quitting and one thing that's helped me is thinking back to when I gave up on quitting.  I would always light up that cigarette I hadn't had in weeks or months or whatever and despite expecting fireworks and a world of glamorous relief washing over me, it always just ended up me sitting there just smoking a cigarette without much drama.  I don't really feel any better or worse physically, but I did set up a savings account that automatically transfers $75 a week into it and used what I had in there to help pay off my truck.

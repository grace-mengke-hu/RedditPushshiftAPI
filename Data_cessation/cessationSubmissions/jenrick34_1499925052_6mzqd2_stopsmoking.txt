Almost day 4

I have tried to quit many, many times. Day 3 is always my hardest. It always feels like an endless, relentless craving. I try doing something else, drinking water, chewing gum, sucking on a straw. These last few attempts I have been using the patches but day 3 still kills me. Any other suggestions to overcome this day 3 constant craving?

Is it harder to quit the second time around?

With the help of this sub I managed to be nicotine free for 1 year and a half. The pain and agony I have experienced during the first few weeks is still fresh in my mind and the nightmares of smoking again and the feeling of relief that it was just a bad dream. One day out of the blue I smoked one cig thinking it's not gonna hurt how stupid is that, failling on one of the most important piece of advice from carr's book and the rest is history. The next day I'm back again to one pack a day maybe even more. Everything happens so fast that now I'm a heavy smoker again, 2 years and counting. Back to the same old piece of shit I used to be. The unhealthy, lack of energy, can't focus, can't get shit done. This is really frustrating and I want to end this now and hoping that I can do it again. Sorry guys just venting out here.

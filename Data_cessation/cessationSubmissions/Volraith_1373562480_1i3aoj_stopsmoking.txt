Feeling weird.

I've been keeping up my nicotine levels with the disposable ecigs (which I think are much safer/less bad for you than cigs) ....but I've been feeling funky for a couple weeks.

Only sleep 2-4 hours a night, not eating much (which is weird because I'm kinda fat...working on that too but...)

I don't really have any energy. Anyone else feeling weird like that? Up until about a week ago, I would smell someone's cigarette and my mouth would water, I would crave pretty bad.

Now when I smell it, it kind of makes my body feel funky. I'm not going to be one of those ex smokers that hangs out with my drinking buddies (who smoke) and whine and complain and bitch at them for smoking. I changed, not them, I shouldn't expect them to adapt their routine on my account.

I don't know if it's because I've been feeling bad or not, the smell thing. Pretty sure no cigs is why I'm feeling bad though, anyone have any thoughts?

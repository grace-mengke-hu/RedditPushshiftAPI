2 Weeks and I'm seeing so many benefits!

I'm posting here to motivate myself and maybe others on quitting. It's been 14 days, and already my wheezing is gone, my quitzits are fading and I can taste and smell again!

What I love most though, is that I've started running again. One thing I've noticed since quitting is that I don't wake up feeling sluggish and unmotivated. I actually feel I have energy I need to get rid of, and now my lungs cope far better when I go out for a run with my doggies! I feel more alert and in tune with my body, it's incredible. 

So yeah... hopefully more positive updates to come. Keep going, everyone!

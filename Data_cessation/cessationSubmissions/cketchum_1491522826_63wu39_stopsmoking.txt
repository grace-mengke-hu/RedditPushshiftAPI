Anyone quit smoking and biting nails at same time?

I am 34 years old and had to stop smoking two weeks ago, cold turkey.  The weird thing is...when I did this, for some reason I also stopped biting my nails without thinking about it, which I have done pretty severely since I was about 4.  I looked down about a week after I quit and realized that I hadnt bitten my nails and they were growing out.  I have bitten my nails so unconsciously since childhood that usually I dont realize Im doing it.  

Has anyone else experienced this or have thoughts as to why this might have occured this way?  I am, of course, happy with the cessation of both habits, but I guess I expected I would bite them MORE to deal with the generalized anxiety I have.  

Thoughts?

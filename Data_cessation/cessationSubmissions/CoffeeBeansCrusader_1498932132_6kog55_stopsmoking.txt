Cutting down before quitting

Did anywhere here cut down before quitting?

I have a rare disease that means one of my cellular responses misfires over everything and nothing. While smoking is bad for it - sudden changes are worse.

I'm allergic to vaporiser liquids, and the adhesive on patches. I can chew gum but I don't like it. I cannot have any medications for smoking cessation as I'd be high risk. I'm not about to go chat with an office clerk who's been on a course about this, she won't have even heard of half my medical conditions and therefore wouldn't be in any position to comment or suggest anything. At my surgery you cannot get help from a GP, only the filing lady :-/.

So, hopefully that will ward off 'just go cold turkey man, you're just making excuses...' comments, and someone who successfully cut down on the road to quitting would be willing to share their story with me instead? 

I'd be really grateful for any stories or tips about cutting down before quitting.

Does it ever end?

I've been smoke free no problem for 6 months. Before this round I've gone a year a few times, two once, 6 months or so multiple other times. It's not insanely hard for me to stop for long periods.  The thing is, No matter how long it's been or how much I think it smells awful or makes me feel like shit, I fucking like smoking.  I find it relaxing.  I often want to start again because I like holding them, socializing with them, walking out of a building with somewhere to go and lighting up a smoke to start my journey.  All of it.  I fucking love it.  I quit for my health and the smell and for just general quality of life.  Does this desire ever end?  Or will it be a forever lost love for me to dream of and reminisce about til the end of my life?

Day 1 no sweat. But Day 2 is a Monday. 10 am is a trigger. Tips and blessings invited.

This had been a fine Day 1. A bit of head buzzing but so what? Happy, really,  to spend a day free of the beast. But it's a Sunday. It's tomorrow,  Monday, that I'm worried about. 10 am in particular. It's my worst moment. New week. Back to work. I'll be fine first thing. Get to work. Get some things  done. Then 10 o'clock. Coffee and ... smoke. It's a different world than my weekend world. It's my challenge. I will pour my best energy all over it. But your tips and blessings are invited.

Had a realllly bad dream AGAIN last night.

Woah, this was the worst dream by far. Smoked a whole fucking pack in my dream and again...I knew that I have started smoking again and told myself that I am quitting after this one pack.

After I woke up I felt like I have really smoked. I don´t want to reset my batch because of it but it felt so real this time.

Beside my draems I have no troubles at all anymore. I work out like a champ, love the air and been in nearly every scenario where I would have smoked and didn´t. I don´t get it why I start to smoke in my dreams again and again and again. I want to be like the guy who was able to say NO even in his dreams.

Thanks Allen Carr: I'm a non-smoker now!

I was smoking for 11 months, about 5 a day. 2 months ago I tried to stop using the willpower method. It worked for I week, then I had some personal problems and started smoking again.

On tuesday I found out about the EASYWAY on this subreddit and just ended it now! I can't really how happy I felt after my last cigar, I even cried of hapiness!!

Thanks to all of you on this subreddit, I'm feeling so free now. The last thing I wanted was to get hooked for a lifetime. The book's method worked greatly to me, hope it helps more people around the world!

YIPPEE! I'M A NON-SMOKER!

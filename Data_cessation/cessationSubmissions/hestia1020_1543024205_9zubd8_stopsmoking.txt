Yo I'm back. I posted earlier, and quit as I posted. I fucking hate this already

I realized as I posted that if I keep waiting for the right time to quit I'm not really committing to quitting and being kind of complacent. So I quit. And I'm already miserable. My anxiety has been super manageable the last few months and now it feels like the world is ending and I'll never be ok again lol. Literally everything looks like shit and makes me anxious. I'm super excited to go to my incredibly stressful job tonight.

Anyways, this anxiety is good enough reason to not smoke again because this is miserable and ridiculous. I shouldn't do anything that makes me feel like shit. But I legit dont know how I'm going to do this, and my crazy brain is definitely telling me I'm going to permanently feel anxious like this. What a party.

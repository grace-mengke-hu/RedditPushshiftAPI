Two months in and the most painful part is watching movies where characters really enjoy a good cigarette.

As I said, I'm two months in right now. Was watching hacksaw ridge last night (not that great of a war movie btw) and there's a few scenes with characters smoking and seemingly really enjoying it and I went bonkers.  

What did I do? I took a drag of my weed pipe and tried to calm down. Somehow one or two hits of weed seems to help but in a way it's just another potential. Nonetheless it's not nicotine and ultimately what I've discovered is that crazy desire for cigarettes is really just a form of anxiety that needs to be resolved. 

If I can help any of you it's being prepared with a coping mechanism when you're at your weakest. I feel like I'm winning though just by being ready for the worst this addiction has in store for me.

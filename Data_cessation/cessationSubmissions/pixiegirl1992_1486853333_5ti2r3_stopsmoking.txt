Struggling

Hi everyone , I recently put up that I'm 1 month smoke free and had a great response and loads of encouragement, thankyou! 
I'm struggling this past week Im vaping instead of smoking and I have switched to different flavours, I'm just wondering does anyone else miss the heat from smoking? Like that burny feeling that hits the back of your throath?
(I'm not missing the taste or just the habit of physically holding a cigarette)
I was just wondering if anyone else got this point in there smoke free journey?

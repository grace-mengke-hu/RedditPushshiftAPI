Slipped up.

I was 25 days in. I was still having cravings, about 10 a day. then after about 20 days the depression set in. I don't know if its a combo of SAD, being dumped 2 months ago or just actual depression. But I lost the will to go on, I was driving home after work and my foot almost came off the petal. I didn't know where I was going and why. I didn't want to go on. So I said Fuck it, the depression was unbearable. I bought a pack and decided to start taking the Zyban the doctor prescribed me which is also an anti-depressant. Here's to day 1 again.

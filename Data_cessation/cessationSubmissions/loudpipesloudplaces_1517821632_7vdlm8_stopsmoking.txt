1+ month in via the Patch, sense of smell?

Hey everyone, around 12/28 last year, I stopped smoking cigarettes and switched to using the 7mg patch, currently planning on using it until the end of February (2 months).

While I initially got some of my sense of smell back, it hasn't really returned to what it used to be, though I only really smoked 2-3 cigarettes a dat for about two years. I also had a concussion last Spring, so I'm worried that the lack of smell is a result of that. Could using the patch affect my sense of smell though?

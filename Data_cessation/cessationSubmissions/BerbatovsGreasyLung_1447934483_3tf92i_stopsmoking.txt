Past 100 days for the first time!

I feel fantastic - I've just noticed that I'm past the 100 days mark for the first time since I started smoking, way back when.

Thanks to everyone in here - though I haven't posted much, reading all of the posts and advice has been really helpful. Every time I got a craving I read some posts and it helped me get through them.

**What have I learned?**

I honestly feel that this time around has been easy. I had serious cravings for like 5 days, and they have diminished substantially with time. But this time round I REALLY wanted to quit. This time round, I didn't start out trying because I thought I should. Instead, I had a particular goal in mind, which was to reach my wedding in February 2016 having quit so thoroughly that I wouldn't even think about smoking on the day. 

I think the mechanics of quitting can be achieved by anyone, in any state of mind. But you'll do better and have an easier time if you really know and understand the reason you're trying to quit, and if you see the quitting process as being a difficult but supportive process towards a goal you're trying to reach. This outlook has certainly helped me.

The other thing, I think, is that there's not really a correct way to quit. There's the way that works for you. Finding that way is hard, but once you find it you'll reach your goal. I think this means that you shouldn't be too hard on yourself if you fail - just try something else next time. If it takes you 5 years of constantly attempting to quit to get to the point where you're a non-smoker, then you're still in a better position than someone who just smoked for 5 years and didn't try to quit. 

I had a lot of shame and self-doubt and beating myself up about trying to quit, and I felt it for a long time - I spent years in the mindset of knowing I HAD to quit, and knowing that I was killing myself, and that combined to make me want to smoke MORE. Letting go of that shame of failure and accepting that I might not get it perfect, or get it right first time round, and learning not to hate myself for that, really helped me to quit this time. I really feel like I'll never smoke again. 

**What's better?**

*I always exercised as a smoker, so I was never too unfit. But I have seen dramatic improvements in fitness, especially high intensity stuff. While I've always been able to do endurance running/cycling, I've noticed that I can now do sustained sprints at speeds I could never get to before because my breathing would stop working. My maximum heart rate has also gone up, while my resting heart rate has gone down a bit further. On the stationary bikes at the gym, when I used to do HIIT, my heart rate and effort would max at like 180bpm. Recently I've noticed I can get to 200+ bpm for short bursts, so I can put out more power and effort. I suspect this would be more beneficial if I was actually an athlete, but it does mean I can make my workouts shorter! I just feel healthier, too.

*Obviously I can actually taste things again now, which is awesome. Also my tongue used to get lots of ulcers and sores, but that seems to have stopped happening. 

*It's easier to wake up in the mornings now. I've also found my concentration has improved a lot.

*Physically, the best thing for me and my fiancee has definitely been related to erectile function...I'll say no more, but if you need a reason to give up, improved blood flow is a good one!

I'll sign off and say that I used to think I could never quit. This sub helped my by showing me lots of people who have, and to be able to see them talk about what they did right and what benefits they got has been so helpful.

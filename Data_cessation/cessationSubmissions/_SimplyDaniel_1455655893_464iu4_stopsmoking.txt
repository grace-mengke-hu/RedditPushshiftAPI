It's been six days and...

Backstory: I started smoking at a very young age, 14 is when I had my first cigarette. I stared being a regular smoker maybe 15/16ish? I'm 23. Anyways I quit six days ago because I'm so sick of smoking and my mother got very ill from it. I haven't really had any crazy cravings or any withdraws but when it comes to me sleeping I can't get good sleep I wake up two or three times at night but when I was smoking I would sleep the whole way through the night, or always sleep past my alarm. Has any previous quitters experienced this?

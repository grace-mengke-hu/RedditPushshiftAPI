What method worked best for you?

Hi Reddit,

I want to put my smoking days to end. I'm currently on 20 a day, wasting my money and, as an asthmatic, not doing myself any favours.

I'd just like to hear what methods of quitting worked best for you? I've been considering a vaporiser, then maybe onto patches to reduce the niccotine intake. Looking forward to hearing your experiences. Thanks.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies folks, much appreciated

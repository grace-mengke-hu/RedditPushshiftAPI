Champix and anti depressants

Hey guys so I have just started champix, on day 5. I feel lethargic, not motivated, haven't been sleeping well and to make matter worse am now just super emtional about everything. I get the tablets can increase anxiety and so forth and my partner doesnt want me to stop trying to quit and neither do I. I want to kicj this habit once and for all. But is this approaching shadow of depression worth it. I was a smoker for roughly 10 years and have cut down a heap. Also managed to quit for 3 months last time. 
I am just worried this wont settle and will potentially make my anxiety and depression worse. What does everyone do to keep their chin up? Helpful tips or hobbies? Any one have similar experiences? My Dr warned me about this potential side effect and doesnt reccommend using champix with my current medication but i cant use patches. Vapes are no good as I just smoke again.

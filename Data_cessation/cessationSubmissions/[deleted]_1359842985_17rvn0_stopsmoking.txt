My badge is wrong. I have failed, but I'm up to another try. 6 days and counting

Kind of depressing when I saw my old badge saying 137 days. This was my first attempt, however, I don't know how long it lasted.

I catched a flu last weekend, this is a great opportunity to quit and so I'm taking another shot. By now it has been really easy (since I wouldn't enjoy it anyway), but please wish me luck for the following days/weeks/months ;-)

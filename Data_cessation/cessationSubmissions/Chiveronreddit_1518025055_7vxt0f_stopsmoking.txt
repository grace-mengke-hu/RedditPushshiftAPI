Did my nicotine addiction make me dumber?

I feel like from the time I started smoking (15) everything became much more difficult. I always attributed it to getting older, but is it possible that smoking enabled me to become less intelligent? 15 years later, before I quit, I spent half my time thinking about my next smoke and the other half of my time wishing I didn’t smoke. Now that I’ve quit, almost 100% of my thoughts are generally about that. Is it possible that since for so long so many of my thoughts have been geared towards smoking, that I have missed out on critical thinking and it has actually made me dumber? Will I be able to think more critically once the addiction is gone and not consuming my thoughts?

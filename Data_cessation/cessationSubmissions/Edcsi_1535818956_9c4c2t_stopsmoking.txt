Day 16th- still dizzy -help!

Hi Everyone,
After 20 years of smoking a pack per a day I am smoke free  for 16 days. The "normal craving" has reduced a lot.
But I feel dizzy and sad all day long.. when i am lying on the bed is ok, but when i would like to do something or go somewhere i feel dizzy. But very dizzy.
I am on NRP, just 2 nicotine tabbs per day and i wanted to quit that also yestarday but i started to feel dizzy from that time. Today is dizzy all day long..
Did somebody feel the same way? When it will be better? When will the dizzyness disapier? When will i be happy again?
I have two children and a husband and i just wanna be happy with them.. but now i am just lying.. is it normal?

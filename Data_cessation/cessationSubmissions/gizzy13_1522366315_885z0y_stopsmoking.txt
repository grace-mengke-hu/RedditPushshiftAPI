Mom started smoking again, I’m so disappointed

Found out my mom has started smoking a few cigs here and there. I don’t know how long she been lying to me and my father so don’t when she exactly started. She had quit 5 years ago after smoking for 30 years and I was so proud of her. I’m so disappointed now. I screamed and yelled at her which I feel bad for now but I’m just so mad.  Why would she start after all this time? I don’t know what to do. She’s almost 60 what the hell is wrong with her.. sorry I need to vent. I don’t know how to help her. I gave her Alan Carr’s book but she refuses to even look at it and tells me she’s not started smoking  “just smoked a couple out of stress”. Isn’t that how we all started? It only takes a couple of cigs to get hooked again.

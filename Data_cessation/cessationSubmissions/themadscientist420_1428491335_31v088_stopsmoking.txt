Dealing with restlessness?

Hi guys! I quit smoking 5 days ago and, after the third day, it's become a lot easier than I thought it would be. The one problem I have is I am often very restless now: I get bored really easily and cannot sit still, so I have been pacing a lot. It's especially annoying because I need to get work done but sitting at my computer for hours on end is a nightmare sometimes. Anyone experienced similar symptoms? If so, how long till they go away? any general advice?

Hello people! I quit smoking over half a year ago.

I just looked through my submissions, and on one of the first few days [Link, I wrote it on day 4 apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/5llshq/please_tell_me/)

Looking at the post, I was reminded of the desperation I had felt, and this is my Update: The really bad urges started dissipating after day 6... I won't lie: it's ridiculously hard up to that point and, iirc, it didn't really get better until 1 or two weeks later. Finally, after about one month after I quit smoking, I felt like, and was a complete non-smoker anymore.

Now,you probably have already heard/read of it, and maybe you dread it. I sometimes still think of smoking, on rare occasion even dream of it... In the dreams, I usually feel pretty guilty for smoking, but that just makes it better when I wake up, and look at one of my achievements: this achievement of having quit smoking.
The urges aren't as much of an urge, as they are mere thoughts of smoking, so I really dont feel threatened by them, probably not more than any other non-smoker.

So, to sum it up: It worked (Alan Carr method), I now have lots more money, there's a small respiratory bonus, for me, because it was only a couple years, I have a clear conscience about that whole cancer thing, and I'm just so fucking glad I quit.

You can do it too!

Help me!!!!!

I am going 11 days strong without smoking.The feeling  is so awesome I can breathe again.  Thank the Lord I actually went two of the 11days without a patch on. Today being one of them.  Like i said i feel great. Here is my issue. My mother practically chains smoke in her room and every time she lights one up i smell it. At first i liked it but now it is making me sick to my stomach. Literally i want to puke.  And a big reason i quit was because second hand smoke around my daughter. Well she is still getting it by my mothers smoke. Even though she smokes with her door closed i can smell it every and all the time. This sucks so i quit smoking to inhale someone elses second hand. This is stupid. Ive asked mom to go outside she is 68 and is stuck in her ways. She refuses. HELP ME!!!!!!!

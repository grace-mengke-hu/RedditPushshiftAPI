Getting more difficult as I go.

The first week was absurdly easy for me. Afterward, it kind of feels like all my other attempts to quit. I'm irritable, uncomfortable, I have nightmares, I'm anti-social. Anyone else have this issue? Quitting is harder the longer I go. I'm on day 11, btw. Not long, but like I said, first week was a walk in the park.

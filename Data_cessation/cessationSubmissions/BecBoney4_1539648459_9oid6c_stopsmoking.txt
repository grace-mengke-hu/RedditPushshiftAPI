I don’t want to smoke anymore

There’s 12 left in my packet, I don’t want to smoke anymore but I don’t think I have the will power. I’ve quit twice now, I always take it back up. It’s worse at work, everybody here smokes the last two times I quit I was on leave and started when I returned to work. How did you guys do it? Has patches worked for anybody?

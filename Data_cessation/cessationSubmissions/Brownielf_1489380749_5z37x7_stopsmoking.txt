33 hours

Full disclosure, I've been vaping a bit. I've been sick as shit and figured it was as good a time to quit as any. I've been subbed here for over a year and even had a few quits that lasted for a few days at a time since. But now I'm done for real. I'm ready to breath, to smell, to live without always waiting for the next drag. Tomorrow is going to be really tough as I'm in sales and spend a lot of time on the road, but I'm committed to not picking up another cigarette. This post is a reminder to myself 10 years from now as my quit date.

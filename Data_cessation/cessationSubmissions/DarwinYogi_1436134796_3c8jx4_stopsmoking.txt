How I Quit

I smoked for 20 years, Camels mostly. Toward the end I was up to 2 packs a day. For the last 10 years of my habit, I tried to quit numerous times and failed. Once I went 5 days w/o a cig before. I said "screw it."  The change came when I realized I was addicted. I was an addict. I needed help. Quitting on my own hasn't worked. With this clarity, I got professional help and it worked. I learned all sorts of good stuff about nicotine and understood why for me going cold turkey was doomed from the start - no knowledge, no real plan. I am not sure the organization I went to is still in business - Schick Center - but my point is more general than just that one way of doing it. If you struggle with smoking like I did, get quality information rather than just quitting on your own.

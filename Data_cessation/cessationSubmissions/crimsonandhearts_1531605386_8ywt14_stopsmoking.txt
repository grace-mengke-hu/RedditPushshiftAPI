Day 13 on Chantix.

Tomorrow will be two weeks since I started Chantix and I am 3 days smoke free!! 

My sleep troubles have gone (the thc gummies Iâ€™ve been eating before bed have helped lol), but other than that Iâ€™ve had zero bad side effects! I went out with my coworker yesterday and the smell of her cigarettes and what she smelled like after smelled so nasty. 

The mornings have been hard but everyday it seems to get better. Itâ€™s weird not to smoke, though. I feel like Iâ€™m missing something. 
Iâ€™m so happy. I never thought I could do this ðŸ˜­

On Day 2 of no nicotine. Been on chantix for two weeks... This feels awful.

I started Chantix 2 weeks ago (13 days).  Is is possible that I have already passed through the physical nicotine withdrawal while being on the chantix?  This stuff is rough on my emotional state, so I want to stop it now.  Will I go through full nicotine withdrawal once I stop the chantix?  Any advice is much appreciated.  I'm wallowing in some serious self hatred and pity.

Stopped drinking 138 days ago...next it's cigs. Just checking in

Hi all, r/stopdrinking was a revelation, it made the unthinkable and previously unachievable happen.  Well, I Made It Happen...little weak, pathetic me.  I discovered that a little discomfort is OK.  I discovered that with a little planning, support network and blind strong-willed stubbornness my life could reboot itself.  I have never felt so complete.... but I still smoke.
Smoking 'helped' break my alcoholic behaviour, it gave me a little something to take the cravings down from level 100 to a more manageable 65 let's say.
But with a heavy heart and an excited buzz in my stomach I feel I am now ready to break this dreadful habit.
I can see myself as a non smoker, I can visualise the first time I'm around smoker friends, it will not be easy but I will fight and win because the benefits are just too great.
I am not looking forward to day 1, hour 1.

Any advice much appreciated...

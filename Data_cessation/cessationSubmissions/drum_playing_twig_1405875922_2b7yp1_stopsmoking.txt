Clean 50 days - I just bought a pack - Threw it away after 3 puffs

I wrote recently about how I was considering smoking again since I was on vacation, feeling bored and lonely and simply didn't give a fuck anymore. 

Well, I just bought a pack of smokes, went out on my balcony, sun still hot and beautiful. I lit one up thinking I'm gonna enjoy it, like I used to.

**1st puff:** Instant cough. "Haha damn, my lungs are virgin lungs again"

**2nd puff:** Breathed in the smoke a bit slower this time. "God damn this tastes like shit."

**3rd puff:** Took a really deep puff, anxious to get that nicotine buzz. Held the puff for quite some time in my lungs, breathed out. Coughed again. Started to get dizzy. Not good dizzy, but nauseos dizzy.

**Epihany 1:** Holy fucking shit. That Allen Carr dude was right! We only smoke to feel "normal", what non smokers already are feeling. 

**Epihany 2:** All those nostalgic feelings I previously had about how awesome it was to sit on my balcony with a beer and a smoke was just an illusion, now shattered by my coughing lungs, nausea and shit taste in my mouth. Disgusting.

**Epihany 3:** Smoking as a non smoker is fucking disgusting. I didn't feel a single good feeling at all. 

**Results:** I instantly threw away the entire pack. Not even in the trash but I poured water in it and threw it away in a trashcan outside. It was a big mistake of me to buy the pack. I regret it badly. But at the same time, 3 disugsting puffs was all I had, and those puffs shattered my entire illusion of how "wonderful smoking was" and I think my resolve to not smoke again is even stronger now. 

**To all of you who've managed to be clean for more than three weeks:** Every nostalgic feeling you have about smoking is FALSE. It's just an illusion. What you remember is that you felt like shit for having withdrawal symptoms and the cigarettes quenched those momentarily, giving you the illusion of feeling good. Don't give those cancer sticks the credit for making you not feel a shitty feeling which they caused in the first place.

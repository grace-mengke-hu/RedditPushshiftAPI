Quitting tobacco

I decided for the 40th time to quit. This time im determined to do so and any advice is welcome. Im just going cold turkey, whatever the side effects, im ready to take them head on.
Also im a little bit worried not to become fat, since im a skinny 21 yo who has been smoking a pack a day for the last 2-3 years. Ive heard that weight gain is common in people who stop smoking, thanks in advance.

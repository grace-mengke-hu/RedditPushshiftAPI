Decided the best way to honor fallen vets, was to make sure this one (me) lived a bit longer.

Hi everyone.

I was an Army 37F for some time, have had some friends that didn't make it back, and some harrowing experiences myself. I've tried to quit smoking a few times before. I usually smoke on a weekly basis about a pack and a half.

I thought that today would be a good day to quit in their memory. I'll probably be lurking here for a good while, thank you for having me. 

*EDIT - Part of my introspection has been that living my life to the fullest (and healthiest, which goes hand in hand) is what they would want for me. I don't mean to come off as being egotistical.

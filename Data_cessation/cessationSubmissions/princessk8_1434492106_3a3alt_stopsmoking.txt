Missing breaks with Coworkers!

I really miss going outside to smoke with my coworker/friends. I didn't make a big announcement about quitting, so everyday people keep coming up and saying;

"When's your break? Wanna go outside?" and when I tell them I quit they keep saying "oh, i can lend you one."  

So. Hard. Want. Cigarette.

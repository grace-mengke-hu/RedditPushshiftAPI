Want to quit

I've been smoking cigarettes for the past six or seven years. I honestly can't tell you when the last full 24 hours I went willingly without a cigarette. Which then makes me realize how much I do smoke, and gives me anxiety, and makes me want to smoke. I can't do patches, they're too much for my skin. What are some solutions you guys could pass on to me?!

Last cigarette yesterday

Hi all, i had my last cigarette yesterday. I just want to post for some accountability on stopping! Do you guys have tips for those cravings? Has anyone put on lots of weight?

I went on the exercise bike today; i only last 20 mins because i could hardly breathe so I'm really looking forward to seeing this improve over the next few weeks. Here's to no ciggies today :)

New Year quitters!!!

How are we doing peeps? Seems like a long time since I posted. Just wanted to check in and make sure we are all cruising along! In couple days we will be 70 days deep in this biznich! Hell yeah! 

I don't have ANY cravings at all. It feels great! 

Biggest thing right now I noticed is my skin. My face skin looks so much healthier and just smoother. I don't know how to explain it. It just looks healthier!

My teeth are considerably whiter too. I don't bleach them as often as I did before. My mouth feels AMAZING! I love it!

Keep it up kids! Soon we will be 3 months in!

Fresh Start

I am about to finish Allen Carr's book and I feel scared and hopeful at the same time. The biggest problem for me is the thought of NEVER smoking again. I know it should something to be excited and happy about, but it scares me. Also I am afraid of failure after a long period. It is rather easy for me to not smoke for 2 weeks, but then I start missing it. I know now that there is nothing to miss and that I will feel miserable after starting again, but will I remember it? 
I hope I will keep everything in mind what I have learned. I will smoke the last one in a few hours.
Wish me luck!

Edit: I just destroyed my remaining cigarettes one by one. It felt great.

The solution against smoking was Exercise.

So, I quit smoking on the 2nd of September 2017. its been 600 something days since then. I have never looked back.

&amp;#x200B;

What got me going was exercise. The first thing I did after quitting smoking was joining a gym. Something I had never done before, because I found no point running and exercising, when I had to smoke 2 packs a day after that.

&amp;#x200B;

This membership has been life changing. It gave me a purpose, it gave me a goal and also made me realise that I would never have been able to exercise the way I do if I continued (or started again) smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, do yourself this favour and start exercising. Running, swimming, gym, strength training etc. Just something that will not allow you to even consider that smoking isn't harmful.

Oh and yeah, during those 600 odd days, I also have saved around 3300â‚¬. Not bad!

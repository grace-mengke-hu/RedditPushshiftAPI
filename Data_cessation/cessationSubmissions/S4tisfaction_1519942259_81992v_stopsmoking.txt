Past the 3 day mark, caved in on day 4...

Was super sick over the weekend, and I've bewn trying for YEARS to stop. As I'm typing this I'm smoking. This is hard. I realize I'm not strong enough to stop cold turkey. I bought Alan Carrs book, and a vape but thought I could do it by my self. I can't. Working as a chef doesn't do much for me either. Anyway stay strong guys, back to square 1. Tomorrow is a new day, tomorrow back to day 1 cigarette free. Thanks for your time.

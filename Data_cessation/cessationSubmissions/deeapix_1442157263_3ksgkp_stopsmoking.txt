I get these awful cravings when I see people in movies smoking.

Ok, so is it just me? Whenever I see someone smoking in a particular hot way in movies I loooose it. I still find smoking hot.  I haven't kissed a smoker since quitting but I guess in real life a smoker would turn me off. 

Still, I get some bad cravings watching everyone from Shameless smoke, haha.

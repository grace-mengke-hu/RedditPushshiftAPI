How was day 4 to 7 for you? When did it ease up

Damn. I've quit many before but this time it's like I forgot how bad it must've been the previous times..

We always say 3 days and it's out of your system as if it's the hardest period. To be honest first 24 hours were easiest for me. It started to get really rough by day 3.  Things that would usually make me sad or anxious are absolute murder right now lol. I'm feelin extra down... feels like all my problems are worse. I feel them worse I mean.

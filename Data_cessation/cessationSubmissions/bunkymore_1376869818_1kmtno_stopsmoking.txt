I have 5 cigarettes left, I'm so tire of the mind games I play with myself

I won't throw them away, I just can't. I try to quit in the morning and if I have one or two left in a pack, I smoke them and then figure, well, I've smoked today, so might as well keep on smoking. I'm ready to quit, but nervous. Nervous I'll somehow miss them, miss gagging on cigs, smelling like shit, coughing and wheezing when I go for a walk. Its all so stupid. I know I'm addicted, I also know I can get thru the withdrawal, not my first time at this rodeo. Just need a little support. I'm planning on being done tonight, not smoking tomorrow (even though I have a full day family event)--never is a "good" time. Thanks for reading.

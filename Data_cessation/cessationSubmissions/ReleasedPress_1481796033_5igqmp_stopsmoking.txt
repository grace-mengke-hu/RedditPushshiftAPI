4 days in. help.

So i got bronchitis, decided that was my body's way of telling me to quit. Have been wanting to quit for a few years, have never managed to stay quit. Made it a year once, but usually I make it a few months and then relapse. But I feel like this is the defining quit. I either quit for good now or die of something horrible later. I am 26, I am far too young to let cigarettes be my demise. Withdrawls are hitting me hard. I am gritting my teeth and chewing gum, i have washed everything in my house probably twice now to both distract myself and get rid of the smell. And now its 4 am on the 4th day and I cant sleep. God this is so hard.

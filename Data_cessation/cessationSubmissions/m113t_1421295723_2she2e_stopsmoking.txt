Today I helped my mother stop smoking. It is her Day 1 today.

My mum has given me so much in life. A shelter over my head, lots of money, clothes, etc - and today I gave something back.

Close to 500 days ago, I was a chain smoker and today I have been clean of the terrible addiction for along time. IT feels so good to be able to stop, and help others. 

That's the beauty of /r/stopsmoking and Allan Carr.

Recommendations to help clear my chest?

Been giving up on and off for several years. Gave up on Xmas eve only to relapse and smoke 3 cigarettes on Dec 30th.

Feel good off the cancer sticks but I'd really like my chest to clear faster - my lungs feel heavy and full of rubbish. I know this will all come up (sounds horrible) slowly over time but does anyone have any recommendations for helping to dislodge all that tar and muck and clear it faster. I'd like to start running once I've got my breath back...

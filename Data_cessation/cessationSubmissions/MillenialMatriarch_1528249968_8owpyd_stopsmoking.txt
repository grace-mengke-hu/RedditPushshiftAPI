Two weeks down- some thoughts for those contemplating or just starting. (Long)

I won't lie, today was tough. I'm still not used to  eating breakfast or getting through afternoon slumps, but I'm trying to be mindful of that and patient with the process. Low blood sugar makes me tired and cranky, but eating resolves what smoking did in a matter of minutes  (just not seconds like before).

Things aren't miraculously different, but they aren't terrible either. At the very least I'm comfortable with being quit for all but maybe three to five 30-second clips a day. (If that)

My 5 year old has told me I smell pretty multiple times, my 14 and 13 year olds tell me they're proud, and my dog has had longer and more frequent walks than ever before. 

My circulation in my legs still seems to be shit, but the staining along my gum line seems to be getting better. Haven't coughed anything up, but no longer have that dry-tickle in my throat. Food doesn't necessarily taste better, but I find that the more processed stuff tastes over sweet or salty now so I'm eating more fruits and salads (a plus). My garden smells so lovely I Can just sit in my usual smoke spot and inhale in the sweet scents. Honeysuckle is in bloom apparently all over where I live and commute because I catch whiffs everywhere. Also, the bodywash we use is overkill and has been replaced.

This week I have to drive 6 hours total with parents of my kids classmates for a water park field trip. I won't need a patch and won't have a monster headache from withdrawal or the shame of sneaking a quick smoke. That will be a welcome change for sure.

I'm glad to have gotten this far, and hoping the healing keeps going smoothly. If you're on the fence or feeling discouraged I hope you'll push through.  Nothing is ever perfect, but quitting so far seems pretty worth it.

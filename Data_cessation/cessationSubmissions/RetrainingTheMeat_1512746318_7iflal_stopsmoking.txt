It's been 18 days since I decided to stop smoking on nights out

I know I shouldn't really be here having only smoked eight cigarettes in my life (all in the last two months), but it was starting to escalate nonetheless when I had two cigarettes in one night for the first time 18 days ago. It doesn't help that I love lighters and collect them. But even on nights out I've stopped bringing them.

Social smoking I think is just as bad - it can so easily lead to full-time smoking, which is why I've decided to stop NOW while it's "easy". I've not had any cravings or anything. Just wanting to quit now while I'm ahead.

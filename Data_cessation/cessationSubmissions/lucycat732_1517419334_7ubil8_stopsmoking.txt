Yet another reason to keep up my quit

Yesterday my mom was diagnosed with MS. It was actually a bit of a relief, in the sense that we'd been looking for an answer for YEARS. She just seemed to be deteriorating for no obvious reason. 

As soon as I got the news, I of course dug myself into an internet research hole. And studies show that (1) the MS risk is 1 in 750 for most people, 1 in 40 for those with close family members with the disease; and (2) exposure to cigarette smoke appears to be an environmental risk factor for MS, with smokers one and a half times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than non-smokers (and smoking once you have MS can severely accelerate the effects of the disease). My mom has been a smoker for 30+ years.

So yeah, here I am at quit day 31 and I can add "fear of MS" to my ever growing list of motivators to stay away from cigarettes forever. Hoping I can get my mom to break the habit so we can focus on slowing down the MS train for her. Thanks for all of your encouragement here; maybe I will get her to check out this forum!

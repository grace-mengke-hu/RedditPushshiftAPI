I quit smoking sort of

I got my vape pen Saturday and I have no urge to smoke! Goodbye cigarettes. 6mg of nicotine... Although I might boost it to 24.

I found a loop hole, I love nicotine and I'm not giving it up!

If you are considering to give up smoking I suggest the vape alternative.

I struggled for years to put smoking behind me and this is working perfectly.

Best of luck everyone.

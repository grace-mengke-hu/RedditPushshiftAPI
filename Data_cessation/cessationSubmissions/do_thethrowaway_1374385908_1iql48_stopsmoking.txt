Quitzits are they real?

Well, here I am 14 days in. I'm breaking out. Now, I break out in sporadic patterns but I notice bigger, more severe zits in all my quitting attempts. Anyone else go through the so called "quitzits"? Now in a progress report, I'm having an easy time this time (3rd attempt, all went over 2 months) just light cravings. I was able to turn down a free cigarette while trashed. Lots of phlegm but proud of it.

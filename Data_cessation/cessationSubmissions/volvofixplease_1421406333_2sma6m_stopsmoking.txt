Four weeks later

If someone right now told me that they would give me one million(1,000,000) dollars if I accepted smoking just one cigarette for fun with them I would happily reject the offer and continue my life without any regret.
To think that 30 days ago I said to myself that I would never quit smoking becouse it was the best thing in the world...

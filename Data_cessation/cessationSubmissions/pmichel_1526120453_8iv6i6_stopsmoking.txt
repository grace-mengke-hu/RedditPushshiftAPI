The Joys of Freedom

3 weeks free from a 44 year pack a day habit.  Boy,  does it feel good to not be chained to a pack of cigs. Free to spend my time any way I want to and I smell good!  All day. No more washing hands, mints, perfume, air freshener on hair, trying to hide the awful smell. What a relief to be free. :)   I am breathing better and am up to 20 minutes a day on the elliptical. Getting free from smoking makes me want to do other things that are good for my body. Like rebuilding health with good food and exercise.  Anyway so happy to be 3 weeks free.  
Wherever you are in your quit, focus on the positives, all the good things things you are gaining like your time, focus, etc. 
Stay Free!

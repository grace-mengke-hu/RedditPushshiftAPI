3+ weeks free from smoking

One of my good choices, I recommend it! :)
First week was a hellish struggle, after that I had to fight just a few strong triggers. I'm happy I didn't give in, right now, I go through the whole day without craving a cigarette, it doesn't even enter my mind to be honest. Good luck.

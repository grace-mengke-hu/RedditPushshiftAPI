Quit cigarettes, but vaping like a fiend. Thoughts?

I've recently quit cigarettes but replaced it with vaping.  I've seen the recent article linking vaping to heart damage, and I'm rethinking my vaping habit, which I had thought relatively benign.  I'm aware of studies saying nicotine can change the brain in ways that make cravings possible years later, I'm afraid to fully get off nicotine but it seems more and more like the only way to go.  Hope this isn't too off topic for this sub.

Suggestions for fidgeting toys?

I'm about to embark on my journey to becoming a non-smoker. I had an appointment with a pharmacist earlier this week to go over my plan - what will I do while driving, when stressed, when drinking, etc. They suggested that in my downtime, I get something to fidget with, like a stress ball, or a puzzle. Does anyone have recommendations for a good portable puzzle-type thing? For example, a Rubik's cube (except I don't want a Rubik's cube - I'm trying to QUIT smoking, not make the problem worse).

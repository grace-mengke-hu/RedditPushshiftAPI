Day 2

Hey, 
Officially passed day 2 had 1 less craving than yesterday! I've tried to quit loads before and the first couple days are easy it's usually the 4-6th day that begin to get hard for me, we'll see enjoying my lunch breaks at work because I'm not rushing around to get out for a cig I can eat and read books. Life's looking up from here! 

Thanks for all your support it honestly helps a lot!

Made it through hell week

I've once succesfully quit for seven weeks a couple of years back and then smoked one cigarette while having a few beers. I've smoked a pack of cigarettes a day ever since. 

In total I've been smoking a pack a day for about seven years of my life now (mid-twenties). Last week I quit smoking and I haven't touched a cigarette since.

I've gotten my life on track recently (job, girlfriend, own apartment) and finally got around reading Alan Carr's easy way. It hasn't been easy this week but I flat out REFUSE to smoke again. I hate being dependent on something that ruins me.

The thing that helps me the most during the cravings is one of the things Alan Carr put in his book. About the desire to smoke being a little monster, and me killing that monster by not feeding it nicotine.

My throat hurts (probably quitters flu mixed in with aircon on at night), I'm on edge and have to go to work in a couple of hours but one week feels good. I feel like I'm at a turning point in my life and the decision to quit smoking is the first of a few good calls I'm gonna make to become healthy and happy again.

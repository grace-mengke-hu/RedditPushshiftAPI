Two months, hot-diggity-damn!

Day 62, and I am now off the anti-nicotine meds for over two weeks. Having very light and easy to resist cravings, a sore throat (probably unrelated) and the growing notion that not smoking is the new normal for me. Somehow it (most of the time) just doesn't occur to me anymore to smoke.

How much longer until I'm officially no longer a smoker??

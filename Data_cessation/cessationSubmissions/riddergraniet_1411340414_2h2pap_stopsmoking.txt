Need help in convincing gf to stop

Ok so I know every person needs to make his or her own decision in stopping, but here is the thing. I love my gf and the only thing that is bothering me to no end and keeps me up at night is her smoking addiction. We have had a first talk about it in which I shared my concern and told her that I love her too much to lose her over cancer, such a preventable thing.

I feel that she understands me and she wants to quit, but she can't pull it together to actually do it. Of course I don't like this, because I don't know if she's actually gonna do it soon or not.

Reddit, what can I do in the next months to help her quit? I don't want to have the same conversation over and over in which she acknowledges the bad habit and says again that she wants to quit but doesn't. I don't want to give her more self doubt and actually move her away from stopping by bringing it up all the time, yet I don't want to drop the topic and wait for her to start the quitting process since it's really important for me.

Please help me to speed things up because I don't think she'll do it really soon on her own.

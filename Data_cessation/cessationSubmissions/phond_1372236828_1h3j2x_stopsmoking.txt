I'm leaving, thank you for the help. You others: bite through it!

It's been 679 days now. I have been hesitant to leave as I have felt that I'm obligated to stay, if only for the moral support of others who are still struggling (in my head, I haven't contributed much).

I want to leave now as I'm so disconnected from my former smoker-self that this sub just isn't relevant to me anymore. In case anyone has questions, is in need of actual support or wants to talk about how much smoking sucks, feel free to drop me a PM :)

Thank you all very very much for your help!

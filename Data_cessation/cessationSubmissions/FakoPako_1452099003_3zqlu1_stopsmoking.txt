The nicotine is gone out of your body

Well....this is it. It's officially in my head now. I am nicottine free after full 5 days of not smoking. No patches, no gum, no ecig...cold turkey! 

Everything from now on, is in my head. I need to stay strong and make this New Year resolution last my whole life. 

Who is with me you sexy not smoking bastards you!?!?!?!

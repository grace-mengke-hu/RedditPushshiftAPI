Stressed out

My girlfriend just recently broke up with me and smoking was a big issue. I decided to stop for the sake of our relationship and my health. I'm on day three and just now I'm craving so bad. She wants me to change and see were and if our relationship can move forward. But it's so stressful not being with her and holding her in my arms like we used to. I don't want to lose her so I'm not going to smoke. But it's hard when the person you love isn't with you for support. Help....

From 20-25 a day down to 1-2 a day with the patch?

I don't know what I want from this I guess I just want to see if this is good or bad or what. I smoked 20-25 cigs a day for 5-6 years. Tried the gum, chantix, the lozenge and vaping but this time it is actually somewhat working. 

I'm on the 21mg nicotine patch. It has stopped my cravings and since I started wearing it 6 days ago the most I have ever smoked has been 2 (I don't even enjoy them) and the least has been 3 puffs on 1 cig before tossing it. 

My problem is that I can't seem to get down to 0 and I fear that as soon as I go lower in dosage on the patch I will go from 1-2 a day to 4-6 a day and then back to where I started. In addition the patch gives me vivid dreams (that aren't particularly bad or anything just sort of weird) and makes me quite queasy sometimes so I sort of want to lower it but am fearful to for the aforementioned reason. 

So I am doing well, right? I think I am. I simply don't know where to proceed and am fearful. I have yet to have a day where I haven't had a single puff. I don't even get anything while on the patch and yet I still want those couple of nauseating puffs. 

Any advice or empathy is much appreciated.

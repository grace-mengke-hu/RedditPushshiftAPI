Looking to throw my vape away and quit all forms of nicotine for good but I’m concerned.

My vape has kept me away from cigs completely for 2 years but it’s time to be done. I’m worried though that if I get rid of my vape completely that in a moment of weakness I might stop off at a gas station and get a cigar or something. I’ve never tried those “fuse” things or whatever they have there. If I do have a moment of weakness, is there some kind of one-off vapor product at a gas station I can get so I have a fall back that’s still vape instead of tobacco?

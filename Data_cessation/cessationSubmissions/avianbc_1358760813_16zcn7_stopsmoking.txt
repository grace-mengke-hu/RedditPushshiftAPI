Question about sleep habits (Also, 1 month! YES!)

I've read online that smoking cessation leads to insomnia. I had the usual insomnia for the first few days after quitting. Now it seems as if I can fall asleep fine but I always wake up after about 4-5 hours and cannot go back to sleep.

My sleep schedule is completely messed up. I've chalked this up to my quitting but shouldn't this have stopped by now (1 month after quitting)?

Also:  1 month nicotine free for me! I quit nicotine and caffeine 1 day after I received my degree to free myself from my vices. I hated the fact that something external had such control over me.

I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years. Honestly, with the exception of the first few days, quitting has been a lot easier than I expected.  I guess the experience is different for everyone.

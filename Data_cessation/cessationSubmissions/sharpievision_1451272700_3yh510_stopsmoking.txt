Today is the day.

My boyfriend and I are planning to start running for the new year. He casually mentioned maybe I should cut back on smoking because lung capacity and health reasons. I want to live a long healthy life with him. I decided to quit today. Anybody have words of encouragement or advice to give me? I've tried to quit before, but never had the motivation to really stick to it.

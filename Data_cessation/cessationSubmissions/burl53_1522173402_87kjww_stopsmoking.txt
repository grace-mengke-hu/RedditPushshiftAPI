Had a cigarette just to try

Ran into my sister while walking to class the other day. Decided to have a cigarette with her for old times sake (and I was curious if I’d still enjoy it. I don’t really consider this a moment of weakness because I’m dedicated enough to not let it become a habit again. More of an experiment). 

I just have to say, I don’t know how the hell I started smoking because god damn it was disgusting. The taste didn’t leave my mouth for hours and I was coughing for a few hours after as well. I’m so happy I left this habit behind me.

EDIT: wow. I didn’t really think much of the situation but I guess this could have potentially been the start of a slippery slope. I really appreciate the advice and I will take it to heart

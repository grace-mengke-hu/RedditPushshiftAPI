Made a terrible mistake with my nicotine patches!

Argh! I really need to vent. I was smoking 2-3 cigarettes a day, sometimes 4 or 5, when I decided to quit 6 1/2 weeks ago. I began the first level of nicotine patches, and after the first box, graduated down to the 14mg. When I went to the store last week, I thought I grabbed the 7mg box. Well, today, I started thinking about how weird it was that now when I go too long in between patch changes, I'm feeling pretty sick and sweaty. So...
Turns out I had bought the 21mg!!!
Ugh! I'm so upset! I never even had this much nicotine to begin with! I accidentally made myself MORE addicted! And I wanted to stop buying patches because they're so expensive and a pain in the butt! (I have to time my workouts and showers around them, which is very annoying).

I'm just so upset! This weekend, I have 7 weeks smoke-free but I'm feeling so crappy about this oversight. I'm contemplating buying the 14mg but then just quitting after instead of going to the 7mg. I can't believe I did this. Anyone have any encouragement or anything for me? I just feel so crappy about this!

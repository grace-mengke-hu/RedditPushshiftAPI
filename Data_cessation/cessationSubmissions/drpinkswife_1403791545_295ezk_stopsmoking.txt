5 Days 7 Hours 25 Minutes

Not that I'm counting. Yesterday I threw out the open pack and lighters. Couldn't commit until then. Have Â£25 of unopened packs that Im having trouble just binning. I'll get there. As you can probably tell I wasn't planning on stopping. And I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get to have that last one, that I knew was the last one. Let that go. Let that go. 30 years was enough time and money wasted. 

Cool thing: went to the farmers market yesterday and the smells were amazing! Even the fish stall! And the guy that makes the leather goods...

I've taken up baking to keep myself occupied.  Luckily, I have a thin husband who can just eat and eat.  I don't want to eat the stuff. Yesterday I made a cherry pie (pitted the cherries myself) and today I'm going to make a carrot cake, which is maybe too easy but he really likes carrot cake. 

Thats it. First post. I'll be back.  Thanks for posting stuff. It helps to know I'm not the only one struggling and to read the success stories!!

When will I not want to smoke?!

Starting over.

I quit a year ago.  Almost exactly a year ago.  I started back in June.  I've been sick for months.  I'm under an intense amount of stress and have been for a prolonged period-- it was part of what made me decide to just start back when the urge hit so hard and didn't go away.  I keep getting sick and I know not smoking would go a long way toward helping.  Besides, it just sucks.

Anyway.  Here we go.

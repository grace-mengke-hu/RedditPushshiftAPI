Mom can't stop smoking hooka

I know this community is supposed to be about encouraging addicts to quit and giving them support and I am not an addict, but I am in desperate need of help. My mother is addicted to hooka. She knows the risks, she is a doctor and knows how bad it is for her. She just can't seem to stop. Idk what to do. Nobody in my family wants to do anything to help her stop because they think she will stop on her own and that we can do nothing to help her. I really don't agree with that. She hides it from my dad and stays up late to smoke. This has been going on for two years and a while ago, my dad told her if she didn't stop, he was going to divorce her. So I can't ask my dad for help because my brothers and sisters don't think its worth tearing our family apart. Her own aunt died of lung cancer recently and she wasn't even a smoker, she got cancer from second hand smoke, and even then my mom didn't stop. She does it in the house and pollutes everybody. We are Arab so smoking hooka is a cultural thing. Her friends are enablers and smoke with her even though she knows she has a problem. They let her come over to their houses so she can smoke without us knowing. Her friends sometimes don't even smoke with her, she will be the only one smoking. I love her and I want to say something but I know nagging won't help. Idk what to do and nobody wants to take any steps towards helping her. The worst part is that she tries to manipulate me and is extra sweet when she is about to smoke because she knows how much I hate it. She will say things like "lets go shopping tomorrow" or "do you need me to put any money in your account?" and it really makes me cringe. I'm begging you, somebody please tell me if there is something I can do because I can't just sit here and do nothing, it's tearing me apart.

Today at 23:20 UTC+2 i smoked my last cigarette

I know that it will be tough especially because i am fucking 16 but i will try. I just read a lot of your posts and i think i am ready. I tried to quit i don't know how many times so far especially with all that shit that i am dealing. I hope at-least one person will see this. 
Thanks,
Nick

10 days!

My smoker's flu is still pretty bad, but I feel great, because I know that I am on a good path!

I have quit (and relapsed) several times over the past years, and based on that I know that I am an addict for life, but that doesn't mean that I will go back to actually smoking! No! I will stay vigilant, I will not let my guard down!

One practical thing that that means is that I will also have to give up on alcohol, because that seriously increases my risk of relapsing. I am prepared to do it, because the alternative is not pretty.

Fortunately, quitting alcohol has also many other benefits. And a few downsides, but that's too bad. Perhaps I can find some middle ground, like only drink on very special occasions. But I think that will not be possible.

Anyways, that's something to think of at a later moment. Let's first try to not smoke for a few months before I will consider what to change next.

Good luck everyone on your own journey!

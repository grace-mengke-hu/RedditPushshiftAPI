One week down

Last night at 9pm I made it a week. It has not been fun or easy. A lot of people in my life smoke, so it’s been tempting but I have held strong. Yesterday was a rough day, had a pretty bad argument and I almost lit up, but I decided not to. I’m breathing better, but sleep has not been great. I’m not gonna give up though, I need to stay smoke free for my daughter and for me. I find working out eases the stress in my case. To everyone else out there quitting stay strong you can do it, I know if I can make it a week you absolutely can.

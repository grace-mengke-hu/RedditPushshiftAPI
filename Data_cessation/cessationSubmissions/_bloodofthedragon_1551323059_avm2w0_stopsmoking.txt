I am such a jerk to people when I’m quitting!!!

So I’ve been trying so hard to quit. I’ve posted before about day 1 and I didn’t follow through. The last few days I only had 2 cigarettes but I haven’t made it a full day yet. Anyways, I can see and hear myself being a total asshole to people I love and care about. It’s just little comments. Harsh words that I know I shouldn’t be saying and would t usually say. I know my brain is playing tricks on me. I know I can quit because I quit for a year before. I just have to make it through one day, and I can start again tomorrow. I’m sorry for being an asshole!

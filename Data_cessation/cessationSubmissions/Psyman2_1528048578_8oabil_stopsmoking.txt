A different way to quit

For those out there who have tried everything to no avail, I wanted to give a different angle, maybe something else to try.

I quit smoking by quitting or replacing everything that would remind me of smoking.

That includes a minor change in my daily route to avoid passing by the shop where I used to buy cigarettes, but also not downloading any quitting app, not visiting this subreddit after the first few days, not going out with friends who are smoking for the first month, etc. 

Fourth attempt at quitting and the first one to work for me. 

Not going to speak against proven concepts here. Apps, hypnosis therapy or supportive communities do help a lot of people by making it easier to quit, but not everything is for everyone.

If you found yourself failing, maybe you're one of the people who can't stand constantly being reminded of your old habit whenever you open your phone (app), sit in front of your PC (reddit) or  leave the house (shops). Maybe these reminders are what made it difficult for you.

First, try quitting with help. Grab all the help you can. There's a reason why these things are recommended over trying to tackle the issue on your own and the reason is: They work.

But if they have failed you, maybe you can handle it better if you can create a gap between constant reminders and yourself.

At least until the first few weeks have passed :)

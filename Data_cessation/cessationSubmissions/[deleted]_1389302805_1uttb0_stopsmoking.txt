70 days no smoking, but constantly sick.

I know that colds and stuff are pretty common for the first couple weeks, but I am getting a new cold every single week. I mean I will feel like crap for 5 days, better for 2, then a new illness hits me. The only thing that has changed is quitting smoking. I just wondered if this happened to anyone else, or if it is just me.

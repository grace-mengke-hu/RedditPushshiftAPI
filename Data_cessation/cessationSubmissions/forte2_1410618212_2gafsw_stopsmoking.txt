After 24 years I'm finding it a hard habit to break but it's been 1 day 10 hours so far.

I'm really tired, I work nights and I think the smoking may have been keeping me awake somehow. I really really want a smoke. And sleep, my bed would be so nice right now. Only 2 1/2 hours until I can go home.

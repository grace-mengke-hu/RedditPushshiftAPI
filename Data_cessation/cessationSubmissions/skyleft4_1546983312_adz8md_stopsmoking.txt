Just made it to one week!!

This is the longest I’ve been without smoking since jan/2013... I did 10 days without it then after smoking about two packs a day all 2012. I’ve never smoked that much since then which is a plus. 
Every time I get a cold or allergies I get bad bronchitis and that is enough to wanting to quit because I know it’s caused by cigarettes. I’m 29 female and have been smoking since I was 16-17. 

I tried quitting a few times the past few years and got to that mindset “I will only smoke when I drink”, but that backfired so many times. 
I live in San Diego and smoking cigarettes is considered shameful and disgusting here. It’s actually weird because almost everyone smokes weed and is way more acceptable than cigarettes. 
So I was feeling embarrassed to smoke in public. 

I found that I also needed to quit drinking, because it was making me gain weight, act like an idiot and feel physically sick more times than I can count. Also because I accepted that I have a drinking problem. 
And worst of all... It was making me smoke tooooo much! 

I quit drinking 36 days ago and quit smoking 8 days ago. 

I’ve been doing fine without either. But I know that I drink again all goes to shit. Drinking is a huge trigger to smoke. 

Just wanted to share a bit about my story. 

I’ve been keeping busy by working on my kitchen. For the past 5 days I’ve been cleaning, sanding, and painting my kitchen cabinets. It’s more work than I thought but it’s great to get my mind off smoking. 
Plus I am getting so much extra energy. Not sure if quitting smoking has something to do with it but I’m digging. Lol

Anyway. Good luck everyone and thank you for having me 😁👏🏻👏🏻

Can smoking cause erection problems even when you are in your 20s?

I always see that smoking can cause erectile dysfunction but it seems that they are always talking about older men. Ive been smoking since i was 16 and i am now 22. Ive noticed since ive gone up to almost a pack of day, for the last few years my erections have gotten weaker. I do have an anxiety disorder (OCD) which i know can cause erection problems, but I wanted to know if smoking can play a factor at such a young age as well?

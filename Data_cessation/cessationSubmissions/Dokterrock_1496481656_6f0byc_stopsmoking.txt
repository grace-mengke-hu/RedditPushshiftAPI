Quick shoutout to nicotine lozenges

I totally understand this sub's perspective on any NRT item, whether it be vaping or gum or whatever.  But I have to say that nothing has helped me get over SMOKING CIGARETTES than the basic nicotine lozenges.  I only have them when I drink (and yes I need to reset my badge), but every time I've even tried having a real cigarette in the past six months it's been totally awful compared to the 1/2 of a 1mg lozenge I rock with every 2-3 beers.

I don't know if there are any longitudinal studies on the safety of them regarding oral or throat cancer, but I'd definitely be interested in learning more about how safe they are.  Anecdotally, I have a friend who has converted a few of his neighbors from chewing tobacco to the lozenges, which is probably a victory.  I was vaping for a long time but the damn things are pretty much superior in every way, except for the continuing addiction, obviously.

Anyway, sorry for mentioning this in a mostly anti-NRT environment, but considering how discreet and hopefully safer these things *might* be compared to even vaping, since we really don't know much about that, I wanted to share my experience.  I still hope to quit the lozenges soon as well, but I don't feel like each one of them is inviting my imminent death.

Smoker's Cough

I've recently quit smoking (4 days, yay me...) When I was smoking I had a pretty bad smoker's cough but the last few days, since quitting, it seemed to have stopped. But this morning it has come back with avengeance. Is this normal? Did anyone else have a similar experience when they quit smoking? Thanks.

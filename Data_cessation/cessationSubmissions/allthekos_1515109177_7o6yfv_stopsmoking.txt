I've overcome many things in my life on my own. But I need help

I'm dying. I can feel it. I'm so unhealthy, I can't breathe. I've tried everything to quit. Vaping, just made me sick. Alan Carr, obviously works for some people, but being told cravings are so little you barely feel them, when I have cravings so bad I can't think straight...jut didn't do it for me. I've avoided champix as I have mental health issues I don't want making worse. But I think I'll have to try.

I wish I could afford some top detox programme where I'm locked in a room like in Trainspotting. I know if I could get past 3 days I would be fine,  but every time I try I crack.

I'm feeling pretty down about it. I just want to feel ok

3 Days In, couldnt care less about cigarettes but I am so damn hungry all the time. Any Tipps/Snacks/remedies that Help?

Hey I took the step into a healthy life, with a new living Situation coming Up i thought It was a great opportunity to Stop this hell hole of a habit. Used experience and allan Carrs book. 

But now I am freaking hungry all the time. I know thats Just my confused body, but damn man....
I can gain a little weight but I dont want to chubb out. Does someone have some handy Tipps/Snack ideas for a regular Work day? Evening Snacks? Before bedtime snacks? That are relativly healthy ?

Or tipps to get rid of that Hunger would be great

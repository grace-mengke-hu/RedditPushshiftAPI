20 days! Woo hoo!

Just checking in, it's been awhile. I quit cold turkey. So far the key to my success is I've surrounded myself with all my non smoker friends. I have also cut out alcohol entirely. My girlfriend and I now go to the gym everyday and I go for runs every other day or so. It feels great to breath better! Thanks to this sub! I still get on everyday just to read and get motivated. Thanks everyone! Y'all are killing it!

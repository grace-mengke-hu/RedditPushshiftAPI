Done with 1st month!

I never thought I could ever quit smoking for a day let alone a whole month! I feel so great after getting rid of this poison! I feel very sad for the guy i was a month ago, killing myself puff by puff. There's a new strength in me, i feel as if i can do anything, and i have! I have controlled my diet, eating healthy foods. I've also quit chicken and soft drinks, coke, sprite etc. Really, you actually can do anything if you can quit smoking poison. It's much like the phrase, if you can make it in new york, you can make it anywhere! Haha! Best of luck for the fresh quitters! This is the best decision of your lives! Because it was my best.
Anyways, i need advice from my seniors. The app i was using only has a month of excercises and heads ups. Please help me and lemme know what to expect in the coming day7 and how to deal with them. Thanks.

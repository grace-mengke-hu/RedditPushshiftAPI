Smoking and Running

Hey guys I have been lurking for a long time (my badge is not accurate). I was wondering if there are any folks who run and have not yet quit smoking. I have a physical test I need to pass in two weeks and want some advice on whether it would be immediately beneficial to quit now. What I mean is the added stress and or physical repercussions going to be bad for me? I have heard and experienced some cases of people's coughing and spitting up of phlem being worse after they quit. Any opinions? I know I need to and I want to quit but this might not be the right time (total bullshit I know but still). 

Thanks.

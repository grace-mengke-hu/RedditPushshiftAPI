Good news! It doesn't take months to get past the random cravings!

No cravings for days! In fact I only thought about it now because I saw a guy walking with a smoke in the hand, a little over a month and I'm in the clear, wtf is this gonna last? When I quit I found it easy to resist the cravings they got less and less but still came with the usual triggers coffee, after a meal etc. this is a great feeling.

Anyone else quit around the same time as me noticing the same thing?

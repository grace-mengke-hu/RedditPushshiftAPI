I am having a hard time making it more than a couple of days, you can do better.

Patches (25mg/16hr) and lozenges aren't helping to quell the cravings, and to boot when I take the patch off at the end of the day I get intrusive suicidal thoughts and my mood feels extremely unstable.

It's still bearable compared to cold turkey, but the NRT isn't work as well as strong coffee (which only helps for a day or two, and is massively cheaper).

One cigarette and the suffering is gone... but then I'm right back at step 1 again :(

Fuck you brain, fuck you NRT, and fuck my parents for passing this shit down a generation.

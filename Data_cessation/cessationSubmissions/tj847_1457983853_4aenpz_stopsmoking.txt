Sore throat. From e-cigarettes or from quitting smoking?

I quit a couple of days ago but decided to take the edge off any cravings with an e-cigarette. Today I am feeling unbelievably rough and my throat is killing me. 
It might be a total coincidence and I may be coming down with something. But could this be from quitting? Or from e-cigs? It's my first attempt at quitting so I'm not entirely sure if this is to be expected... 
And I haven't been using the e-cig much at all if that makes a difference.  Just wondering if anyone experienced something similar.

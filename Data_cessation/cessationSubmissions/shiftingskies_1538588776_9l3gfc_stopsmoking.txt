Just started to quit today

I just started to quit today, it’s the morning and I already beat one craving. The urge is so strong, but I finally have a desire to truly quit. 

My inspiration comes from wanting to sing again. I used to sing all the time, but now my voice has gotten damaged from all the smoking. I can still sing, definitely not as well as I did before smoking (7 years ago) but I know if I continue smoking I will lose my ability, eventually, completely. I can’t live with that, because singing is my favorite thing, it helps with stress and anxiety and depression much more than my cigs ever could. 

So, the journey starts here. Thought I would reach out for support since this first week will probably be the hardest. There’s this little voice that keeps encouraging me to just smoke one or give in. It’s disheartening because this is only my first day. 

But I’m doing this, for my health, for my future self. 

Thanks to anyone who reads this and offers support.

Finally stopping poisoning myself!

Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I have been an addict for six years now, smoking a pack up to two packs a day, and I'm only 24 years old. I started smoking to deal with being raped multiple times as a child and teenager by a family member. I suffer from PTSD and depression and have been on Xanax and Zoloft for the past three years. 

I have changed tremendously, working hard on myself, my state of mind and how I view myself and the world. As a young female without a family, it has been horribly hard at times, but I have come a long way, apart from one thing - my nicotine addiction. 

I think it's about time I stop this and start believing in myself more and taking even better care of myself. I have wonderful friends and an amazing boyfriend, but each time I would quit I would not commit, not really - the cravings would start and my mind would start romanticizing the idea of cigarettes and smoking and I would light one up. 

But this time I want it to stick more than ever. As silly as it may sound, I'd rather buy make-up with that money than poison. I'd rather save it up for a nice leather jacket one day. I'd rather do anything else but keep destroying myself. 

Sorry for the rant, I've just been able to concur practically anything but my addiction. I question my strength and myself. And this time I want it to stick for good. 

Any advice is appreciated and welcome, and thank you for reading this. All of you that have already quit, and have stayed clean for more than a week, you are my idols and I admire you :)

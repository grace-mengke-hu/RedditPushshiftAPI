Today's the day

I've been putting this off for years telling myself I can do it when ever... without actually trying. I've been smoking half a pack a day for about 7 years and never thought it was serous and that I had control. Not the case. 

I've thought with the the stress of school and exams I could never commit. Well exams are over and it's time to become a better me. Wish me luck!

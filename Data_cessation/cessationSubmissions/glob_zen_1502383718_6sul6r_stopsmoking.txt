Gotta quit cant keep just saying I want to

I've been lurking in here for a long time, 21M smoking a pack a day since 17 quit for five months and started back up. I keep running back in circles trying to put this vice to rest and I feel like it's unshakeable and I can't break it. But I'm going to. That's all that matters.  Thanks for giving me the courage to get back at beating down this addiction.

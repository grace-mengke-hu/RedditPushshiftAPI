Haven't smoked since the beginning of December. I'm not being hit by withdrawals.

I'm feeling angry and sad, going back and forth. I'm getting mad at every little inconvenience and it's starting to build like I want to cry. My mind is filled with doubts as I've tried and failed quitting before. This is my longest so far and I've taken to chewing on coffee stirrers and pacing around when I'm sitting at work, which is where my smoking aches come strongest. I'm writing here mostly to keep my mind occupied and because I know this is a place that can help me and offer me support. 

I want to quit so I can run with my younger brother and be able to stand by them as they grow. I want to be able to go up a flight of stairs without getting winded. I want to live as long as the rest of my family.  I don't want to see myself controlled by a stick of nicotines

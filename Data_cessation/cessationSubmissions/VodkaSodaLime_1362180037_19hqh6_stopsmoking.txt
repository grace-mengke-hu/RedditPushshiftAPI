Feeling worse and worse every day.

Any anecdotal advice would be appreciated. I have quit before but it was always with an aid (NRT or Chantix). This is the first time cold turkey and like the title says, I wake up feeling worse every day. I know it's the body pushing all the nicotine out but damn, when does it end? Maybe I coincidentally got sick for real?

tomorrow is the day

i've been smoking for about 15yrs, and i'm hating it by now. My tobacco is almost done, and i'm ~~throwing~~ flushing away whatever's left before i go to bed. No more coffee (smoke trigger) and smoking from tomorrow on. 

I want to be the guy that can truthfully say he doesn't smoke, isn't addicted, and be more responsable and caring for myself.
I've been subscribed for a few weeks now, and i find all the reminders/stories in my feed very helpful. Perhaps frightening at first, but that's to overcome what you've made me realise.

I'll be starting to hit the gym from the 20th or 24st on as well, i found that it can be a mindgame as well. One i can seem to overcome, and i hope it helps with building confidence to keep strong.

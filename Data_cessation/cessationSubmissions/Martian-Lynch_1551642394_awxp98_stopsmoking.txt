Even if you make it for a long time, never lose sight of the main goal of quitting and always respect the horrid temptation to go back.

I write this as a long-time former quitter. After my wife became pregnant with our second child I decided I had enough. I quit on the spot and ultimately made it nearly 4 years without smoking. I really never thought I’d go back, but stress levels hit an insane high a few months ago and I decided to have a few drags. A few drags turned into a few smokes a day, which after a few months turned into half a pack a day. I’m pretty disgusted with myself, but I also do know I will quit again..and soon. It will be hard as usual, but I’m almost mentally in the right place where I’m done again and can focus on being a non-smoker again. 

I never unsubscribed to this sub and now I know it was for good reason. I still see posts near the top and I always read them. I’ll have to reset my days, but In the meantime I’ll leave them there just to show that the temptation can get the best of us at any point. Just never forget what a devil these things can be; no matter how long you have quit for.

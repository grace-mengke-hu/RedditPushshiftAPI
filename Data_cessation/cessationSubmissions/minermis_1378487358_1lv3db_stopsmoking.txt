Will nights out ever be as good without smoking?




This is for the long term quitters. I know Alan Carr says everything is better when you're off the fags but when you're on a night out, midway through your third pint, can you seriously now say that you don't want a cigarette? I always cave when drinking because I feel that these are the ones I actually enjoy. It's mental I know but I just need to know that it is possible to have a good night out with a bunch of smokers and be the only one not smoking...

I'm 11 days in and about to head out for my first night of drinking after quitting

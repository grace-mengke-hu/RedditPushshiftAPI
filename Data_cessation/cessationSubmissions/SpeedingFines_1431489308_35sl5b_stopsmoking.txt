Nervous about a camping trip

I've been smoke free since April 2nd and feel loads healthier than I have in a long time. I never was a truly heavy smoker to begin with, mostly social, but for me the social smoking was almost a pack a night when out drinking with friends. 

My trouble is that I'm going on a camping trip that my group of friends does every year, and a large part of our tradition is sitting around a campfire with plenty of drinking and smoking. Any suggestions on how to curb the urge to chain smoke but still have fun with the group? I've mainly been vaping to get through cravings but this time I'm afraid it's not gonna cut it...

Scrolling through my reddit history and realized I've been a non-smoker for over 3 years now!

I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/faqhp/im_on_day_5_of_no_smoking/) post of mine from just 5 days after I had begun my journey to quit smoking. 

Now, over 3 years later I can proudly say I'm a non-smoker! For all of you going through the process of trying to quit: don't give up on yourself. You can totally do it and you'll thank yourself later! I'm proud of and excited for every single one of you trying to quit!!

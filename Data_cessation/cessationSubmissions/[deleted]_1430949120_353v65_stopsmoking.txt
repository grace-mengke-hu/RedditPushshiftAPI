Day 10, wondering if this is normal.

I am a 19 year old male, and actually vaped (however, I thought since I am going nicotine withdrawal it would be best to ask here, instead of r/electronic_cigarette) for about a year. I quit completely cold turkey 10 days ago. I was using a dripper on a mod and was burning through 15ml bottles of juices ranging from 3mg-12mg about 1 per week. The first week was awful and I had multiple panic attacks and felt really disconnected from reality, however it is beginning to ease up. Though, I still don't feel like myself, I still have a general feeling of uneasiness, feeling fairly depressed, really nauseous, and even my vision even feels off. I am basically feeling overwhelmed by everything, and I have finals coming up in 2 weeks and am just looking for any help I can get. Any recommendations/advice would be very much appreciated.

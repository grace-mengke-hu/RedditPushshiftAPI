Woot, 100 Days.

I've found stopping smoking actually quite easy.  So much so I didn't even notice passing 100 days until I came back to read this sub recently.   Maybe because I've been concentrating on trying not to drink as well.  Now that, is not so easy.

Love the savings and reaping the health benefits.   Why did I ever start.  Boggle.

22 days 16hrs free, but I've had to quit drinking

I had no idea about the effect it has on your brain chemistry! But I'm kinda all over the place right now. I would normally be a bit of a party girl - v stressful job, drink accordingly, last woman standing, worryingly high tolerance. Since quitting my drunk behaviour has been strange and annoying - I posted some mad shit on social media about suicide last Saturday night and so I've decided the booze has to go too. Oddly enough, I've not wavered in my self-imposed smoking ban. As soon as I quit this time I felt like a non-smoker. Circulatory pains have been pretty intense but have eased off with a few days' leg rest - the fact that I've been getting those has frightened me into never wanting to touch a cigarette again.

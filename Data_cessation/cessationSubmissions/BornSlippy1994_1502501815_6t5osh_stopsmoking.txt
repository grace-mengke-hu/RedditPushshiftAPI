Help - I hate smoking, but I love smoking... And ultimately I don't know who 'I am' with cigarettes

I know there's nothing anyone can say that will make me stop, but I just need some advice. 

Currently 22, smoked 20 a day since I was 15 and I know enough is enough. I cough, I squeeze when I breathe, and I almost lost my job for sneaking out for 'another' cigarette at work. 

But I love smoking. All my friends smoke. When I'm drunk there's nothing I love more than sitting in a beer garden, chaining the fuck out of a pack and cracking on with strangers. 

Can I just smoke drunk? Does that work? Is life better without cigarettes even if you're the only one who doesn't smoke them? Will I craze cigs forever?

I know I'm drunk and rambling but I'm fed up and want to stop but I just wish I'd never started. I don't know if I can go my whole life fighting cravings and forever wishing I could light up a cig.

Halfway through day 3

For the first 2 days, I've been a complete wreck of a person. Moody, teary, angry, exhausted.  I've had a really bad headache, too. 

Now that I'm feeling better, my brain is telling me that just one cigarette won't hurt. Just go buy a pack and have one. The smart part of my brain knows that is bullshit.

I'm finally feeling better but still want to smoke.   It's not a craving like for the past 2 days.  Those were bad. Today it's more like "hmm it would be lovely to have a smoke."

Day 3 is where I've historically given up on past attempts.  So, I'm determined to make it past day 3 this time. Even if I fail on day 4. If I make it one day longer than last time, I'm doing good.

I quit last night at 9pm

I’ve made it almost 14.5 hours now and I’m doing fine. I started 15+ years ago and I’ve been smoking a pack a day sometimes more for the past 5 years. I’ve had enough. My daughter will be three next month, I’m out of shape, I’m tired of feeling like shit. I need to stay healthy for her and for myself. I want to watch her grow up. I’m going to start going for a run after she goes to sleep every night, I’m gonna eat better, and I’m gonna get back in shape. Fuck smoking, I’ve tried and tried to quit in the past but this time I’m going to defeat this shit.

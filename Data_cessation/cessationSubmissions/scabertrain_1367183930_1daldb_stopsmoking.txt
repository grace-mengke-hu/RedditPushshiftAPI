Day 1...Again

About 3 years ago I quit. for a little over a year i didn't smoke! i didn't get cravings anymore, things were great, wallet was better. But then i was stupid. In order to celebrate not having smoked for a year my husband and i decided to have a single cigarette. Yup, idiotic. If you do quite, don't celebrate with "one smoke". So, 2nd attempt now. Undecided whether to use gum or not, i did last time i quit.

Dealing with stressful situations/people

Hello r/stopsmoking community! I’m not sure if this belongs here or not, but was curious how people deal with this type of thing during their quit. 

I am wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on dealing with stressful situations/people during the quitting process. Do you avoid them? Do you embrace them? 

A bit of backstory: I am surrounded by people at work that stress me out. They are the complaining, gossiping type. One of them has invited me to a sporting event. I would have fun at this event, except that I would love to go with anyone but this person. 

The thing is, we used to be closer. But during my quit, I have been distancing myself because she stresses me out, belittles me, and is generally abrasive, which makes me want a cigarette. 

Do y’all think it’s better to embrace these situations rather than avoid them?

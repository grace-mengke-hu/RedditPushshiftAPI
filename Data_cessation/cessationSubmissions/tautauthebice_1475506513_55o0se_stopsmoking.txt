There's this reoccurring thought. It keeps haunting me!

There is no way i will not smoke for the rest of my life. Eventually i will smoke. I imagine having a cigarette in bed. Smoking after meals. It just feels like it offers so much. Life would be perfect if smoking wasnt the devil.

Im doing so well. i get this horrifying idea that even if i make it a year. or 2 eventually i will fall and just live with it.

im 22. i wish cigarettes never existed.

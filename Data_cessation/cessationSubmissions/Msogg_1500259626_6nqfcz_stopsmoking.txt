On Day 5, just took 3 puffs off a cig then threw it away --- I now remember why I was addicted to this shit.

I just went outside, lit up a cigarette, and took 3 puffs of it, broke it in half, then threw it away. 
Now I remember why I was addicted to this, I still am. 
I also feel really bad, because I'm trying to quit cold turkey. But at the same time I also wanted some nicotine, but not at such a high dose. 
I actually felt the head rush a little more than usual, and I just smiled. 
I am now really convinced to quit. I can see what cigarettes do. 
Okay now, I feel horrible, I feel like I just broke some kind of "pact" or something :( , I'm sorry I just felt like I needed some to relax myself, even though the whole point of being here is so we don't need cigarettes. 
I'll seriously try not to do what I just did again, I'm sorry. Because I understand that one puff is all it takes to get started again. I feel like I really just fucked my self, will 3 puffs really make me relapse all over again? I already want to go and smoke a full one. Fuck, I just made a really, really, really bad mistake. Please any comments would help, I feel horrible. 

 Update: Yep this was a mistake. Am I currently going through what they call "relapsing"? I literally just want another cigarette now, that's all that my mind is on at the moment. I just fucked up, really bad. Getting intense cravings and really bad anxiety.

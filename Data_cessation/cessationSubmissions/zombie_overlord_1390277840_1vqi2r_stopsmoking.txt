Two hours away from making it 72 hours. Twenty five years of about a pack a day is coming to an end. I'm determined like never before.

I'm 36 years old, and I picked up my first cigarette when I was 11.  My last cigarette was at midnight Friday night.  I got an e-cig, and paid extra for some upgrades, like the twistable voltage (crank it up for a bigger hit).  $72 for the whole rig, juice, tax, and everything.  It sounds expensive, but that's two weeks worth of cigarettes.  Right now I feel great - the cravings are under control (I also have patches to fall back on if I need to, but I don't think I'll need them), but I feel a little guilty about the e-cig.  It's a great tool for getting off the real deal, but I still have a habit to kick.  I want to kick that as soon as I can, too.  Right now, my goal is 30 days.  That is my record.  In 25 years, I've never gone more than 30 days without a cigarette.  Usually I cave because I would drink, or someone I lived with didn't want to quit.  But I hardly drink anymore, and I'm through letting the actions of others determine my fate.  My wife made it about 12 hours, but that's ok.  She wants to quit, too, but on her own terms and in her own time.  That's understandable.  She'll only succeed when she wants to quit - not when I want her to quit.

New to this sub.  Just wanted to check in.  I got this.

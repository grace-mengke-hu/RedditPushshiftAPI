Was offered a smoke. Declined.

I can't remember if I've ever done that before. I've tried quitting like 10 times over ~6 years time, and this is the first time I've made it longer than 2 weeks! Last night I went out to a bar with friends (I also started a prolonged bout of sobriety around the same time.. That has helped significantly with quitting smoking) and one of them offered me a smoke and I said no. God it was hard. [But I DID IT.](http://media1.giphy.com/media/m12GiqBQywgbS/giphy.gif)

I have a trick: music!

Since the past couple of days, it's been hard fighting those triggers. You know, the moments your mind has engraved 'cig break' all over. When it's 3pm in the afternoon, after a couple drinks at a concert and all your friends gather outside during the intermission, with coffee when you meet up with someone. Yada yada. I know I can't keep my brain from calling those triggers, so why not reattribute the value of those triggers. Every time I want to light one I think to myself, 'this is a trigger. but instead of smoking, it means listening to a track'. I've discovered so much good music this past week, haha :) my playlist is great. what's more, is that whenever I listen to it, I'm reminded of all the times I've stayed strong. Only a couple days in but I feel amazing !

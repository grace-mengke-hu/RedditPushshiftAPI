Help me stop smoking, reddittors

I dont think any of you can actually make me stop, I know only I myself can make myself stop. But, I needed to announce somewhere that Im quitting so I can be held accountable. 
I really dont enjoy cigs as much as I used to, its more of a habit these days so Im ready to quit. And Ive quit cold turkey and lasted 3 months before, so thats encouraging. The thing is Im not addicted to the buzz, its mostly the flavor I smoke (AmerSpirit USDA Organic) and the action of smoking itself I enjoy. But Im ready to quit, so yeah. Tips, suggestions, personal stories, encouragement are all welcome.

EDIT: no cigs left now, time to start counting days, maybe I can beat my 3 month record. Tips/encouragement still welcome.
Ive been binge watching GoT (almost done with season 1) so Im not really bored enough to go buy cigs, + hopefully ill be working next week so ill be even less bored (or more? hope not..)

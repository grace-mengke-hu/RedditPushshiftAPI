Quitting Tomorrow

As the title says, I’m quitting tomorrow after many failed attempts to do so.  At 30, I’m slowly approaching ten years of smoking and that number terrifies me.   I never thought it’d get to this point and I just want to be rid of this vice.   I’m so sick of always being out of breath and feeling lethargic 24/7.   I work at a school and tomorrow marks the new academic year so I needed some symbolic “fresh start” so I figure why not tomorrow.  It’s gonna be hell but I’m ready.  Thanks for listening.

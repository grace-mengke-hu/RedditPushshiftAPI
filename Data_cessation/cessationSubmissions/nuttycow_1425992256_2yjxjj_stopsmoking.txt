3 weeks down - just checking in

I'm three weeks down. I've survived getting drunk, I've survived being around smokers, I've survived meals out, I've done it. 

I just wanted to check in and say thank you to all here for being here for the last 3 weeks. You don't know how helpful you've been, but you have. 

Keep on going everyone :)

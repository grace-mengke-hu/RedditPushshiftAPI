Question regarding other people's experiences.(It's kind of gross)

So I'm concerned enough that I'm going to go to the hospital once my roommate gets back to take me, but I wanted to see if anyone else had similar experiences.

It's been a little over a month since I stopped smoking. The weekend before last I got what seemed like a stomach virus and a cold of some sort such that for the first couple days I was bed-ridden and had it coming out of both ends, and since then I've had a combination of runny nose, headaches, brief sensations that I might call dizziness or distraction, and an increased appetite. Today it got particularly bad, I felt like I was going to vomit, and I stopped at a public restroom, used it in a typical fashion, and then leaned over it for a few minutes. After a little bit I wasn't vomiting, and tried burping and coughing. The coughing caused the typical vomit convulsion, and then after a few coughs I vomited brown flaky stuff, it reminded me of previous cessation attempts where I'd cough and get a really snotty spit and upon inspection they had brown flakes. 

After this episode I am feeling better, but eating is really unappetizing even though I know I need to eat because the last time I ate was around 1 and I hadn't eaten before then.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?

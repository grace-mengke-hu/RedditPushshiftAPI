Had my first beer since quitting.

And survived. After 2 months without cigarettes and alcohol, I decided to start seeing what drinking was like again. I drank 1 beer with a non smoking friend at my house. Drank it slow, enjoyed it. Barely thought about smoking. I've been so worried about how drinking would go and it turns out it wasn't that scary with just 1 beer. This weekend I'm going to drink a little more, but still do so in a safe place with other non smokers. 

For the last 5 out of 14 total years of smoking, I smoked usually just on the weekend and almost always while drinking. I could easily go through 20-40 cigarettes in a night while pounding cheap beers. Drinking is really another issue for me that I'm trying to now approach differently after this period of abstinence. I can still remember the "fuck it" moment about 10 years ago when I started smoking again after 1 year of quitting. It was while I was drunk. I cannot let that happen again. That 1 cigarette led to another 10 years of smoking!!!! Note one puff ever!

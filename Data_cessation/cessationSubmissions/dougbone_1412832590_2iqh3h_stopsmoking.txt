Sitting here with a balloon head (chronic sinus issue) caught a cold last Sat. and now its settled in my lungs... coughing and spittin' feel dizzy as hell and thinking...it must be time to quit? Oh yeah... here we go... tried it all, ecig patch lozenge gum and reffer...so cold turkey anyone? Wish me luck cuz I think I'm gonna need it.

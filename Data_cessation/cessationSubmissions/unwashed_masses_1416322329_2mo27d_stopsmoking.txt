I am 100 days nicotine free. AMA (quit related)

100 days ago, I had no confidence that I would successfully quit smoking. That first week sucked!  Now, I am in a place where being an ex smoker is EASY. It's all savings, and no cravings. Every day I save money.... and I don't have to go through nicotine withdrawal hell. It's money for nothing.... and the lungs are clean. To everyone on this subreddit, you are awesome, and a huge part of why my quit was successful. I lived here for the first 3 weeks!

Rather than give advice.... there's already tons of great advice here...  I would love to take this milestone to see if any new quitters have questions.

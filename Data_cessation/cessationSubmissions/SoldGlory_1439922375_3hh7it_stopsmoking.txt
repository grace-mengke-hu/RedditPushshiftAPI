12 days in, insane toothache, coincidence?

Hi all,
12 days in without a single puff, "thank ya Jesus", but now a new problem. One of my teeth started to hurt about 9 days into it. This molar feels like it's full of bumble bees and razor blades constantly. I'm afraid it's an old problem brought to light by my new found circulation in my gums. I feel no urge to smoke whatsoever, but is this related to my quitting or just a strange coincidence?

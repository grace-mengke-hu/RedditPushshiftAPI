Do any of you get less chest problems?

I was staring at my teeth in the mirror with flash on, they’re AWFUL! Also I’m currently bed ridden with bronchitis for what feels like hundredth time in three years. I’m only 21! I’ve had enough. I’m going to start today. The last time I had a cigarette was 9 hours ago but I just can’t keep doing this to myself, I feel like I’m going to die. I cough so hard I’m sick.  PLEASE somebody motivate me! I constantly wheeze whether or not I’m ill and I can do fuck all exercise!

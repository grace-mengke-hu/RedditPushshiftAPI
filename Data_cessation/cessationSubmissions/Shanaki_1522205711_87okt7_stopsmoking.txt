This might be interesting to those here... Going to try to quit once again.

I have a problem. The reason I started smoking was because, at the time, one of my best friends ended up committing suicide and it was the only thing I could use for an escape.

Now... EVERY time I have tried quitting (4 in total) someone I know has died, literally a week into me quiting...

So here I am on my 5th (and hopfully final!) attempt. Have Final Fantasy XV sorted on my PC for some intense gaming to keep my focus on something... Anything you guys could suggest on my journey this time around?

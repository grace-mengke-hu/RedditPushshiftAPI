Been 2.5 weeks not smoking, need help with ongoing problems.

Stopped for 2.5 weeks now, 5 days with no nicotine replacement, problem is I now have acute  blurred vision in both eyes, feels like I am going blind. Can only sleep 2 hours before getting up for the toilet. My face now has over ten boils on it and despite eating nearly three times more than when I smoked, I am now the lightest I have been since I was eighteen  (now 75kg was 83kg 2 weeks ago)  been doctors and had CT Scan today results tomorrow and optician said possible glaucoma but, will not know for sure till tomorrow. Feel really lethargic, anyone else get anything close to these effects??

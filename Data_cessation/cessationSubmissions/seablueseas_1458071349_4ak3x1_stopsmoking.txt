Best decision EVER!

I have been struggling for so long to stay quit. I finally admitted that I just can't do it,  I love the social aspect of smoking way too much and cave when I'm drinking. So today I finally got myself a vapouriser. So yes I know I will still remain addicted to nicotine. But I absolutely love it! It's so much cleaner and I still get to hang with the smokers. It's a win win!


If any of you guys are struggling to quit completely, don't be afraid to cheat and start vaping!

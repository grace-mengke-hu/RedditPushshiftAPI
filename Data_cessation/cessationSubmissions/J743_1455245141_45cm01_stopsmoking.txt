Oh Boy...

Tomorrow is Day 1. I'm nervous. Pack a day guy. But I've done it before. I've quit smoking for 6 months. I've quit smoking for a year in another streak. So I know it's possible. 

Between a vegan diet, nofap, and this, things are getting a whole lot better round my way. I'll check in. 

Any accountability partners here??

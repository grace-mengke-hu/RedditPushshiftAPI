What worked for me

I have been seeing a lot of posts about tricks and tips to quitting which got me thinking about what worked for me when I quit. There are two things I think I did right, 1) Getting over the physical addiction 2) Getting rid of the habit.

**Physical addiction**

I tackled this by changing my environment drastically and eliminating all possible ways to smoke. I took a month vacation and went to visit my parents and took the responsibility of taking care of my nephew. I cannot smoke at home (even outside the house since the whole town knows everyone) and I cannot smoke in front of my nephew who is around me almost all the time. Home is comfortable, stress free and has loads of food all the time to substitute the glucose rush from smoking. After that month, when I got back the physical cravings are almost fully gone.

**Habit**

This was the tough part. This is a game of mental associations, you need to break the old associations to form new ones. For example, when I was a smoker I had the association of cigarette to satisfaction/pleasure/calm etc. I had to deliberately change that to cough/bad taste/feeling of something in my lungs. You have to do this every time the old association comes to your mind. You see your friend smoking, you get the urge, you feel "Ahh a cigarette can make me relaxed now" just stop and force yourself to think, "A cigarette will make me cough, smell like shit and add soot in my lungs. Yuck!". Now just keep doing that. You got to associate "cigarettes -> nasty" in your mind. This is tough initially since every fibre in your body will find a reason to keep the old association alive, but you need to do this without exception for 2-3 weeks. "Cigarettes = Yuck". If you do this right, after certain time, the thought of a cigarette will make you nauseous, this is when you know it has been done. You have become a non smoker.

**Extra**

There is another thing which helped in achieving both the above - exercise. I started running slowly (almost walking - 3.75 mph) for 1 mile a day and kept pushing myself slowly every day. Now I can do over 7 miles at speed off 6.75 mph. What I have seen happen when you start running is your body start to take control of your cravings subconsciously. When your diaphragm is hurting and you are gasping for air every day, you'll automatically crave for better food and cleaner air rather than a cigarette and a pizza. Your body will start subconsciously putting you off the nicotine craving without any effort from you. This helps both in overcoming the physical addiction and mental association. 

Remember all it takes is to be strong for about 3 months, then it is dead easy.

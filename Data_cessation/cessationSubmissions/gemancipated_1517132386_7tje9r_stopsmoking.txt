Struggling to get into the right frame of mind to quit

I’ve been a smoker for years and quitting is something I want, but I’m struggling to get into the right mindset. About a year and a half ago I read easyway and it was like a lightbulb moment. After being a pack a day smoker I quit successfully for a year.

Then... after a year I fell into the trap again. I can’t even remember why I smoked that initial cigarette again, but it’s 7 months later and I’m back at a pack a day. 

It’s getting silly and very frustrating. My partner hates it, it’s costing a fortune and of course I feel disgusting. 

I’ve had so many quit attempts in the last few months. I’ve re-read easy way several times, and I’ve also read only way. It’s not sinking in and I think it’s because I’ve lost faith in it - it’s not having the initial impact it once had and maybe it’s just because I’ve read it so many times it just reminds me of failure. 

I’ve also tried quitting with all the usual methods, but I think I’m going to fail with them if I can’t get my head in the right place. 

I’d appreciate any recommendations for getting into the right headspace or any other things I could read. I’m tired of failing and letting my partner and myself down. Thanks everyone!

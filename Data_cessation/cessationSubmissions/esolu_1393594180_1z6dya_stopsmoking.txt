A followup on my placed end to end thread

[A while back I started this thread which was a fun way to visualize the number of cigs not smoked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1m9apx/placed_end_to_end_ive_not_smoked_over_an_american/)

[I came across this little video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czbp9V9F4A) with the number of cigs I've not smoked now, I could build you a lifeline of cigs with 70 feet to spare if you needed to get to the bottom of this hole.

That's a lot of smokes....

EDIT: Post your count of cigs not smoked and I will find you a visualization.

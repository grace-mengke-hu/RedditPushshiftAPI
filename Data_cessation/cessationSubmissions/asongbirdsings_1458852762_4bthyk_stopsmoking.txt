Today's Day One and I'm Taking The Plunge

Whew. Ok so here we go. I just finished the last cigarette I will ever (hopefully) smoke. I've tried quitting a couple times cold turkey, in the last 6 years. I was once completely smoke free for over a year from the beginning of my pregnancy to about 10 months after my daughter was born before I caved and had another pack. Mainly for me it was the ritual of smoking and my peers who smoked that kept drawing me back. My husband also smoked and we made the decision to not buy anymore packs after we ended these last ones. This time I am determined to quit for GOOD! I'm trying to play it smart, now, and use tracking apps as well as forum support to help me achieve my goal. I look forward to sharing my journey with you all at stopsmoking and sharing our milestones together!

From 2 packs of malboro red to 3mg juice in 3 weeks

Been smoking for 15 years. The last 7 of those a minimum of two packs a day of “stronger” cigarettes but mostly malboros. 

Quitting has been on my mind daily for the past two years. Three weeks ago i took the chance with switching to vaping and honestly i couldn’t have been easier. I also got down from 12 mg to 3 mg juice in two weeks. 

Honestly i enjoy the vaping and seeing how wastly improved my health has been in three weeks i dobt plan quiting it anytime soon, i eventually plan to get the nic to zero. 

The three weeks i had packs of cigarettes lying rigth in front of me from family members leaving them at my place. Had zero urges to pick it up and smoke some. 

Wish all of you the best of luck and willpower to quit this nasty addiction.

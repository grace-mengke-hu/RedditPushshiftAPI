Partied hard last night! :)

This Christmas is different. Instead of being with my family, it's me and 6 of my best friends relaxing and partying. So last night things got crazy, we went through way too much beer. My buddy asked me to come outside with him. I knew he was about to offer me a cig! I freaking turned it down!!!!! He asked me sincerely, "how did you quit?" I told him I just didn't want to smoke anymore and with the help of r/stopsmoking, I am in the process of doing that!!! And you know what else!!!!!! My lungs don't feel like crap this morning and for that I am so grateful!!! Thank you r/stopsmoking for your support!! I couldn't do it without you!

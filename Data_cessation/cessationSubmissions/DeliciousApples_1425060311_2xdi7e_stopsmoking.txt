So so ill, but a plus point

I've been really ill still since last time I mentioned. I went into work today but had to go home because I couldn't breathe. Illness has really hit my chest however....! Imagine how much worse I'd have felt if I was smoking, or imagine wanting to smoke when I felt this ill. Would he like smoking razors. Thank god I've made it this far. Don't ever want to smoke again.

Bleeding gums, sore throat and fatigue?

I have braces so I generally practice good oral hygiene but while flossing, I noticed a lot of bleeding and swelling of my gums starting a couple nights ago. It also smells BAD. I also have a sore throat (not the cold/flu kind) that makes me assume  swolen lymph nodes. Also, I'm constantly SLEEPY. 

Anyone have these issues? I think bleeding gums, I have heard of before as you get better blood circulation. But I am wondering if anyone else had similar issues.

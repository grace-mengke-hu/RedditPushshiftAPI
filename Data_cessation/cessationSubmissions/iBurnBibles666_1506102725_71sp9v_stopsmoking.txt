So how exactly does quitting happen?

The first 3 days are the worst, right? or is it the first 3 weeks? And after that it's smooth sailing?

Just trying to understand what to expect. On 4th day now and the craving is hitting so hard now. I damn near gave up mentally. My thought patterns are doing everything they can to get me to smoke!! And I'm trying everything to beat the craving. Feels like torture.

72 Hours and all I'm doing is eating like a fat fuck

I want to jump off a bridge, but not really.  This is my maybe 10th attempt to quit in 10 years.

This time I have a 0 nicotine Ecig with tons of flavored juice.  I hope this still counts as quitting because it feels like quiting.

I'm only getting through these last 3 days by "rewarding" myself with the "eat whatever the fuck you want" concept.  I had pudding, crackers, bananas, coffee, applesauce, cheese, chicken sandwhich, cup-o-noodles, and a breakfast burrito....all for breakfast this morning.  I smashed a 1/2 rack of ribs and small steak for lunch...along with a "blooming onion" appetizer.   About to slam an entire pizza and lava cakes from dominoes for dinner.  I have never eaten this much or this unhealthy before, but fuck it...my butthole is going to hate me later.

I figured I can return to my normal eating habits in a couple weeks, and drop the ecig in a month or 2 since there is no nicotine present.

Anyone else use food/ecig as a crutch??

I relapsed a month ago after 9 months of being 100% smoke free. I’m quitting by tonight but I’m not as prepared as I was before. What advice do you have for someone who has relapsed again after a long period of time?

Chain smoking, pack a day— way more than before when I was towards the end of quitting last year. I’m just so sick of it and need advice to make sure I kick the habit. Thank you.

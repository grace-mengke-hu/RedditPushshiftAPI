Gone cold turkey two hours ago and I'm wondering if I've made a mistake.

I'm scared. But I don't know what I have to be scared of?

I'm a fairly impulsive person and I give in to temptation extremely easily. I think this is one way I want to regain control. I quit for a month or so but I fell back into it because of social smoking, smoked in total for five years.

I've also had a really horrible life-ruinning bladder condition for a few years, which I suspect is caused by smoking.

Just need to focus on the bigger picture. My life will be better without it.

This is just the beginning of something good. Right?

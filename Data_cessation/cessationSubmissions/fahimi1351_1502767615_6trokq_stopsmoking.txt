Decided to quit yesterday morning and bought some gum

Hey guys, new here. I've had a half-a-pack a day habit for the last 9 months that I finally decided to kick. I've been wanting to quit for the last couple weeks, as cigarettes are getting more and more expensive (especially in California, where I go to school), and I don't exactly like coughing up mucus. I also want whiter teeth and to not smell like an astray. Breathing is also cool too.

The first night was rough, but I'm determined to bury this habit for all those reasons. I'm currently using 2-3 pieces of 2mg gum for the next few days, and then quitting nicotine cold turkey. No more dependencies!

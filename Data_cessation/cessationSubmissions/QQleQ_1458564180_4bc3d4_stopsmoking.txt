One Year!

So thanks to this subreddit, a handfull of stopsmoking apps and sheer willpower i have made it to one year. One year with major ups and downs. Lastly, my girlfriend leaving me at the beginning of this year. I managed to fight the urge to smoke again, couldnt be prouder at this achievement. :)

Thanks everyone!

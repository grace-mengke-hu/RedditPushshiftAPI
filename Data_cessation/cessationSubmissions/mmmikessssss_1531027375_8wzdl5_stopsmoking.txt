Quitting obstacle

I’ve been wanting to quit tobacco for a while but the one thing that’s been keeping me is that I have a habit of mixing my weed with tobacco, I don’t have any intention of giving up weed but I’ve gotten so used to smoking mixes that straight weed kills my throat and tastes like ass.

Anyone else run into this problem or got any solutions? I know I should just start smoking straight but it’s really harsh to me

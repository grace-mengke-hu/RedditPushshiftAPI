I am on day four of not smoking. I feel like I lost my best friend of 30 years.

I feel like my best friend is no longer with me. When all else failed I would smoke to feel better. I would smoke to celebrate; to relax; just about everything I can relate to smoking. 

I am going to do this but it is the hardest thing I ever did.

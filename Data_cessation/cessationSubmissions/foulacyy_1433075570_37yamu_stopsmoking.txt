Five days woooo!

Made it through the feeling spacey as hell, starting to feel normal. Don't want to strangle everyone I see, don't care if others are smoking. Cravings are manageable this far and time perception distortion isn't happening as often. I can breath my god can I breath! This sub has given me hope I see people with badges that I want and I'm not smoking again EVER!!!

If I don't want to start over, I won't give up.

Three-days in and.....I’m waiting for the shoe to drop

I am 22, started smoking at 18. I quit for a year until I was 19 and smoked most of my 19’s-20’s but only 3-5 a day. Would go weekends and during church trips a week without, and seems alright. I moved to vaping and smoking, when I turned 21. I started at 12mg of nicotine’s d got to a point to where I only vaped 3 mg of nicotine.

2 weeks ago, I went vape only on 3 mg and that was totally fine! Three days ago I had one nicotine lozenge the entire day and vaped 0mg. Now I’m using no nicotine and vape 0mg of nicotine......and honestly I have read some crazy horror stories of withdrawal and am waiting for it to happen but it hasn’t come, will the shoe drop eventually?

I definitely feel a little headache above my eyes during the afternoons and feel a little less patient now, but it hasn’t been that bad for me yet and I’m almost three days without totally! Has anyone else had delayed withdrawal symptoms? Or am I just lucky?

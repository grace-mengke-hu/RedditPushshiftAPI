2 year anniversary

I just passed my 2 year anniversary and here are some thoughts in hindsight about my experience. For the record, I smoked a pack a day for about 11 years.

* I have saved almost 5 grand by quitting. I treated myself by buying a really nice guitar and gaming PC (among other things).
* Once I got past that initial psychological barrier of my brain telling itself it needs a cigarette (silly brain) it was smooth sailing.
* I can breathe so much better now.
* I used to have serious sinus problems. I would get recurring head colds that typically lasted about 2 weeks. Now that I've quit I have only got a single cold in the last 2 years and it cleared up in about 2-3 days!!
* My general stress level is much less now.
* Food tastes AMAZING. I have complete different tastes now when it comes to food since I quit.

What worked for me was setting a solid date. I used December 21, 2012 and told myself that if the Mayans didn't kill everyone I would stop (hehe).

All in all it was much less of an undertaking than my brain was making it out to be. I wish I had quit waaaay sooner.

Hang in there. It is soooooooo worth it.

Cancer Risk Question

**TL;DR Although I haven't smoked that long, from an average standpoint where would I stand in regards of risk to throat cancer? Quitting the 30th.** 

So I'm a 21/M who has had a lot of Anxiety issues, and that's one of my main reasons for quitting. 

A bit of background: 

-I started when I was 18, never had substances previous (not even alcohol)

-I got into it reluctantly from a co-worker who offered it after admitting to him about my broken home situation 

-For a year I would go through a pack of Crushes in about a 1.5-2 weeks  as well as the occasional hookah session. 

-Got my first hookah in summer 2012 when I moved from the rents and would session (1 hour) 3x daily (no cigarettes and the occasional swisher) 

-After moving again in may of 2013 - september we would session once a day 4 days out the week

-Progressed into only once every 2 weeks

-Had my last session yesterday.... maybe another session today and my last day of smoking will be the 30th considering one of my bro's friends will be of age to hit up lounges and I thought I'd end it on a good mark.

-During those years I'd also go thru electrics like once a month and have  smoked weed like only 8 times (even though those are less/ not harmful)

I feel like I'm in a good position to kick the boot at least for tobacco products. And the reason why I'm asking is because I've had a rocky relationship with my throat. After learning about things like anxiety lumps my worries have softened, but my throat has always concerned me in regards to some abnormal behaviors (could also be the fact I've never had tonsils removed) 

Never really experienced anything detrimental with my lungs throughout other than the usual side effects that come with smoking.

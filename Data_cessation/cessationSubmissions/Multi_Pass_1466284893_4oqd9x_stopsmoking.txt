Today is my 900th day!

Sometimes when I think about it, I still cannot believe I am a non-smoker now. I was the least likely person to quit. I was the person that always said "I could quit, but I *like* smoking". I was the one that made smoking part of their identity. I used it as a social crutch. I met my husband asking for a light (also now an ex-smoker). When cutting back our budget there was a time where I flat out refused to quit. 

Now here I am. **Me**. Wow.

I just want to say to all you newbies out there. It gets better. There will come a point where you don't think about smoking for hours, then days, then weeks, then months. Maybe one day it will even be years.

90 days. 3 full months.

I've been waiting for this day for a while. Probably about 2 years, as that's how long I've been trying to quit.

The first month I used the patch to teach myself that no matter how much nicotine I had in me, I would still experience emotional ups and down because that's how life is. I practiced meditation as a form of walking away and centering, and also got used to drinking without smoking. It worked.

The second month, I took the patch off. I know I wasn't supposed to, but it was making me sick. I constantly just felt... ill. After the first 28 days I stepped down to a smaller one - still sick, so it came off. 3 days of that and I decided I'll just be done. I knew my triggers, I knew how to calm down, and every day on the way home I passed a billboard that said "Even failed quit attempts can lead to a successful one." I would give it a finger gun and wink and a hell yeah.

And that was it. Every few days I would tell a different person how long it had been, so to them I hadn't mentioned it in almost 2 weeks but to me I was telling someone every 3-4 days. And then I didn't need to.

When the weather changed, I wanted a smoke. I just... wanted one. It wasn't a craving. I wanted to sit outside with a 6 pack and a few cigarettes and just chill. But I remember the last 20 times I did that, that it always lead down the same road. I didn't really want a cigarette - I wanted to be outside and was just remembering cigarettes being a part of that. You don't need a smoke break to go outside. You can just... go outside.\

And, of course, this sub for sharing success stories and failures. I see people saying "I fucked up/I'm starting over" and right next to that "I just hit three years," and both of those perspectives help.

Good luck yall.

The fear is subsiding...

I just started a new job. Long story short my mentor took me with him to his new job. I used to go out of smoke breaks with him at our previous place of work. When I started I was smoking a few ciggs a day, by the end it was a pack or a pack and a half day. He left and I was able to cut back (I've stopped multiple times since then, still trying to quit permanently). I was afraid that starting a new job with him around would bring me back into that huge wide casted net that is nicotine. But I've been outside with him many times so far and haven't broken once. I barely even feel any cravings!

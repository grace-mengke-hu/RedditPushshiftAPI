7 days !!!!!

I quit last Sunday ... And during the whole week did not experience hard cravings!! I am amazed and scared... Not sure if this is normal, I was prepared to suffer .. But nothing ... Just occasionally cravings not very dramatic ... I've been drinking about 4lts of water ...!! however I am very happy and proud of myself after 15 years of smoking I can't believe I've been free for 7 days

Coughing fits, dry mouth - anyone else have similar symptoms?

Hey, I stopped smoking about a month ago. I wouldn't say it was easy, but I'm planning to follow through for the long-long-haul this time around.
For the past week or so, I've been having really rough coughing fits, especially in the morning. It doesn't actually feel like I'm coughing anything up, it's just a real rough dry cough that doesn't stop to the point that I feel like I'm starting to gag. At the same time for the past week or so, my mouth has been really dry, like the way it would feel when I would go out for a night and realize the next morning I chain-smoked two packs in a few hours. Just dry and smooth feeling, kind of gross.
I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced or is experiencing similar symptoms, so I know if this is an effect of quitting or if I've caught some kind of chest-cold or something that I'm ignoring since I am blaming the symptoms on recovering or nicotine withdrawal or something.

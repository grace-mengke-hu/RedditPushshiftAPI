I need to quit for my own health and eyesight

My ophthalmologist discovered I have optic nerve drusen and advised me to stop smoking otherwise I could have a stroke and possibly lose my vision. When he told me this I quit almost straight away and sustained it for a few weeks. The past few months I have been back on the cigarettes and am finding it so hard to quit even though I know I have to for my own health and to ensure I don't lose my eyesight. I really need help with some ways to stop, or other things to do rather than smoking in my spare time. I am a 20 yo female who smokes between 4-15 cigarettes a day.

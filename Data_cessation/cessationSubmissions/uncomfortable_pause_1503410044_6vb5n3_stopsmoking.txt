40 Days: Changes are happening

Holy shit, I can’t believe I made it to 40 days without smoking, not even a puff. Before stopping, I smoked about ½ pack daily.  I spent the first 28 days on 7mg patches and 2mg lozenges every 2 hours, then 10 on only lozenges every 3 hours and now 2 days with lozenges every 4 hours.   There have been notable changes.

*No smoker’s cough.  Numerous people have mentioned to me how much healthier I sound.

*I can sing three notes higher than before already!  Not to mention hold a note without dissolving into a coughing fit.  

*My gums were incredibly sore for the first two weeks.  Ow.  But it has mostly gone away now.

*My house smells so much better.  I smoked inside (ick, I know) and now I am planning on deep cleaning and repainting.

*I smell so much better, in every sense of the word.  

*Gained two pounds in the first couple weeks but lost them quickly after getting back to a focus on healthy eating habits.  

*Breathing in Pilates and spin class is far less labored.  I no longer feel like an ass walking straight out of cardio and lighting up.

*The circles under my eyes have lightened, and the whites of my eyes are brighter.  

*The skin purging was bad, damn you quitzits!  But I used the money I saved on not buying cigs to get a fancy hydrafacial and now my skin looks better than it has in years.

*I no longer go through lip balm at ridiculous rates. 
 
*My doctor and dentist are happy with me.  

*My digestive tract is not.  Gross but temporary.

*I am not tempted even when around my friends that smoke.  I don’t smoke cigarettes.

*I also have not drank alcohol this whole time.  

*Smoking weed occasionally helps but I really want a cigarette after.  Post-toke cravings have been the strongest cravings.


My initial goal was to be completely nicotine free by Thanksgiving, when I’m planning another trip to Iceland.  It now seems more than probable that I will hit that goal with well over a month to spare!

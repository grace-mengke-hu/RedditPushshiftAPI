1st day

Today is my day not smoking, I am using the patch... my arm is kind of tingling and sometimes itches. I feel like its helping. I smoked almost 2 packs a day and by now I would be on my 7th cigarette of the morning. But my minds not getting used to not running out to smoke, like it feels weird not going  out. Any suggestions on how to stop that feeling?

Thanks :)

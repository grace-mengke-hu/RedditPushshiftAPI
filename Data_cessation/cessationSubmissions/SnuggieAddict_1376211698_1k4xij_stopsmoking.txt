A smoking dream taking a new turn...

I'm used to dreaming I light a cigarette or two, and wake up mortified until I realize It was only a dream.
Tonight I dreamed I was solving a detective mission (yeah, dreams are silly), and then I pulled out a pack of blue pall malls out of my bag and put a cigarette in my mouth -- but then, in the dream, I remember myself saying - oh, wait! I stopped smoking! awesome! and toss them away.

this is silly but I had to share.

Heading into Day 3

It's been rough and I'm writing this after a particularly hardcore crave. But I'm doing the right thing. I missed you guys yesterday, but I don't want to make a new post everyday and be a pest to the sub. 

So the first thread I followed a link from a response to whyquit.com and I've been on that site a lot. The things I've learned blew my mind. 

Between the lies told to me, the lies I told myself, the lies I fully fell for, and the lies I wanted to believe with all of my being my world has been flipped upside-down in the past few days.

Symptoms have been continually ramping up but I'm looking for the drop off sometime within the next 24 hours. According to whyquit.com after 72 hours my blood should be clear of nicotine. 

A few things that are helping right now. I remember that most times a crave lasts 3 mins so I took that advice and look at the clock, do the math, then say to myself at X time I could have succeeded or failed and it's up to me. 

I've stayed in my house the whole time for now. I don't have particularly anywhere to be in the next few either so I'm going to stick to that. I honestly feel that if I was to leave I'd fail at this point. I'd definitely go and buy a pack.

Anyways thanks for reading and thanks for the support!

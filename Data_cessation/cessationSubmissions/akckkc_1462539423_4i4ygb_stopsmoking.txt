Quitting smoking right now, help please.

So, my aunties currently in the hospital dying from brain cancer. My cousins grandmother was in the room next to hers, and has just passed away. My other cousins wife has also just been re-diagnosed with breast cancer. I just can't justify it anymore, I've always loved smoking but I just can't anymore. The only thing is I literally CAN'T imagine myself not smoking. I can't imagine being in a social situation without a cigarette in my hand, or going on break at work and not relieving myself with a cigarette. How can I do this? Please help me.

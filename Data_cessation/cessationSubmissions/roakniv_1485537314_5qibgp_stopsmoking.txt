My dad just found a part time job...

On saturdays he is going to work as a waiter because "he needs more money" even though he works a hard physical job he is going to work even more. **But** he doesn't have to work more, he spends €200-300 (europe; a pack costs €6;euro is same as dollar) on cigarettes every month.  
I'm a teen and I just wanted to share this here and maybe motivate you to stop lying to yourselves...

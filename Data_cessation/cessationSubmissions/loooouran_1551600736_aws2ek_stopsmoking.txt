Tips and advice please!

So I’ve been a smoker for almost 8 years. I started smoking at 15 (dumb as hell, I know) and I’ve been trying to quit for the last year or so. I smoke about a pack a day and I’m trying to do it cold turkey. I’ve tried other ways of quitting, but always end up smoking again. What’s the best advice for quitting cold turkey? Drinking coffee- smoke, at the bar- smoke, after eating- smoke, break at work- smoke. You get the picture. I’m so tired of being a smoker and I feel like I’m so weak, it’s driving me crazy. Any tips and advice on quitting cold turkey would be amazing. Also, what are some experiences of quitting cold turkey? Do you feel better and will your lungs heal?
 
Thank you so much! :))

Just finished EASYWAY and now can't give a flying foo!

This book really is a good aid into getting your head straight before quitting. The reasons why everyone smokes, on the personal level, are infinite, but are all stupid deep down (unless you have some radical philosophical stance and smoking really does benefits you, then I say "good for you, keep smoking, you're one in a gazillion, but fair enough"). I argued with myself endlessly, trying to prove that I enjoyed smoking. But just let Allen Carr keeping pounding the same points at you and you'll eventually realise your reasons are stupid like mine were and that ciggarettes have no real worth. Bye bye ciggarettes!

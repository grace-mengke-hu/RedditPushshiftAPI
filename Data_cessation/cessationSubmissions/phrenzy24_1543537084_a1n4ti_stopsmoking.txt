Day 7 Trick: Made a Playlist "Smokers Bizarre"

So, yesterday I started making a playlist of some of my favorite feel good songs. You know the songs that give you chills, or make you want to sing at the top of your lungs when you're all by yourself.

To help extend the playlist...I messaged all my close friends for their 1 or 2 feel good songs to add for variety and maybe some I never thought of.

Now when I get a crave while driving (one of my tougher triggers), or I want to take a break at work, I start my playlist "Smokers Bizarre", and its awesome! And those chills are WAY better then nicotine buzz cause they're all inside me naturally!

I love music...and I'm finding this very therapeutic.  Some of my friends picks were not my taste, but definetly getting an extra kick outta other peoples "feel good" songs mixed in with mine. Plus, listening to their songs makes me think of friends I love more than stupid cigs!

Just passing on what is helping me this week!  

Stay strong fellow quitters.

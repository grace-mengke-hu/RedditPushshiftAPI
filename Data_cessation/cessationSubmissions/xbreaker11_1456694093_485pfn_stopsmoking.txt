Not a constant smoker but want your oppinion

Hey, im a person who smokes rarely and ussually smoke during social gatherings or during university. I rarely buy a pack of cigarrettes only for when I know im going out or to a party with a group of friends and most of the time i give away atleast half of the pack. I sometimes smoke with my colleagues at university but when im alone i dont smoke. I dont have an addiction, I dont have a problem about smoking, but my friends tend to tell me that i need to ether decide if im smoking or not and smoke cassually because what I am doing is inbetween and even more unhealthier, however, im fine as it is. I just want to know if what you think about my situation. Although I can controll my urges, and I monitor myself how much I smoke ( if i start to smoke too much i restrain myself and i dont have any urges) people tend to tell me im playing with fire. What do you think? Is it ok for me to keep smoking rarely or should I stop smoking alltogether?

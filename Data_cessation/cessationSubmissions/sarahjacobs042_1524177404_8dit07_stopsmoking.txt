Day 3 on the patch....

I tried cold turkey so so so many times. I came to the realization that I needed to try something else, and yet I never did. I just kept smoking and tried not to think of exactly what I was doing to myself. 

Last week, we found out that my boyfriend has high blood pressure.  Like really high. The odd thing is, he is fit as a whistle. He has never smoked, rides his bike everywhere, barely drinks, eats a really good diet... but his family has high blood pressure and there isnt a damn thing he can do about it except take medication.

I, on the other hand, have excellent cholesterol and blood pressure, yet I have smoked like a chimney for years (though my diet has been pretty good).  So it hits me that I am LUCKY and WHY THE FUCK AM I FUCKING THIS UP????

I started the patch 3 days ago, and ive been dealing with the habits of smoking in my car, smoking on my porch, smoking on breaks at work, smoking after eating, smoking after pooping, because apparently that is a thing....  it hasnt been easy, but it has been doable. I have great confidence in myself to break these habits and create good ones as I ween myself off of the nicotine. 

So, cheers!!!!

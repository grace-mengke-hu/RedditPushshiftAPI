20 days strong, then falls like a pack of cards

I did Allan Carr, stopped smoking for about 20 days, then just came crashing down as I just had a couple of ciggerattes because I was getting too anxious at work.

After all the benefits I felt over the last 20 days, the infinite energy, the endless positivity. I really feel shitty with myself. Hope I can end it here now and here, and never look back for another smoke.

It's a terrible habit.

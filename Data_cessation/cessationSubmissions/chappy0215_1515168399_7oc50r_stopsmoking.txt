First winter flu without cigarettes

Every year for the last 6 or 8, I've gotten flu, bronchitis, or an upper respiratory infection. It took me weeks, sometimes months, to shake it when I smoked. 

I quit August 9th, so I'm about 5 months in. 

Tuesday, I woke up SICK. Couldn't breathe, wheezing like I smoked again. Went and bought my assortment of cold meds and got ready to feel like shit for a while. 

Today's Friday. While I'm not completely over it, I can tell I will be by tomorrow or Sunday. I can't imagine smoking a cig during it. I'm flabbergasted how quickly I've bounced back from what has put me down for the count in the past.

22 year smoker, pack a day. Cliche, but if I can, so can you!

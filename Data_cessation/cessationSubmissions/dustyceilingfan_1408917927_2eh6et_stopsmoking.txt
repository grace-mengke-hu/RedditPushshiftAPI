Need help. Keep relapsing.

I quit cold turkey for 20 days and it felt great. Then, one week ago today i bought a pack of smokes in a moment of weakness. The cigs felt almost as good as i had imagined they would, but I felt very guilty and mad at myself. The next day i threw the smokes away. I lasted another day or two then  bought another pack. My 4 year old son caught me smoking and he sort of gave me shit, asking why i was smoking when i had told him i wasnt going to anymore. I resolved to quit again and threw all my cigs (almost a full pack) in the toilet. Another day passed and then i bought another pack!!! What the hell is wrong with me?! I want to quit but i love smoking. Quitting seems easy for me, its staying quit that i can never succeed at. We are on a tight budget and sort of poor so buying smokes and throwing them away, only to buy another pack is really not smart. Right now i want to throw this pack away but am afraid it will be even more wasted money if i just cave and buy more again. Urrrrrhggggg! HELP!

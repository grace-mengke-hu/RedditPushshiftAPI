Anyone Else Have this Symptom?

So, despite what my badge says I am on day three, and last night and the first night I have experienced this increasing sense of REVERIE. Let me 'splain....
I guess it is a consequence of greater brain oxygen, and maybe since I am otherwise healthy the process starts full-bore right out of the gate, but it does feel as if my brain is like a roman candle exploding in all these THOUGHTs. 
I have been writing reams, going off on these thought trains, getting these strange impulses. Last night I went off on this whole bit about being a night person, and how I belong to the night, blah blah blah, and then I am like, "what the hell is this pseudo poetic shite" (even tho I am truly a night person, have been since i was a baby, literally)....
THOUGHTS! THOUGHTS! My brain tends to run VERY fast anyway, not in a hyperactive, scattered way, but like a wild horse that sorta knows where its going but its just got to GET there. Its always been something of a problem with me, where I am very smart but get bored with subjects easily because I can suck the marrow out of them very quickly. This whole process seems to be stomping on my accelerator. Really, I don't need that. 
Same with my emotions- my emotions are exploding and its like one moment melancholy, the other laughing uproariously. I know i am not bipolar- just good ol' garden variety depressive- do you think all of this is due to increased oxygen in the brain? Anyone else have this?

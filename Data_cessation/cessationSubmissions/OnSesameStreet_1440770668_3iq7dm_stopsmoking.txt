Day one...

So just finished Allan Carr's book and decided, screw it - time to stop.

I've been on 15-20 a day for the past 8 years (the biggest break I've ever done was about 2 weeks when I was 19). I keep feeling this massive sense of *boredom*, like all I want to do is go out and smoke? 

Did any ex-smokers experience this/have any cures for it?

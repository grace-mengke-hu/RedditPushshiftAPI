2 months! Here's a post about my progress.

I have been wanting to make this post since i quit for 1 month. Each day i planned to write this thing out but i just never got to it. Now that i made 2 months all of a sudden i feel that i HAVE to share my progress now. So here i am!

I'm 20 years old. I have been a smoker for 3 years. Around 10 cigs a day. I decided that i have had enough of the slavery... The need to smoke to clear my head.. The fucking addiction. I had enough. I didn't want any of it anymore. My brother and sister were both smokers, but they quit some time ago. They both recommended Allen carrs "easy way to stop smoking" book to me from the moment i started smoking. I never bothered to read it because i felt i had my smoking under control. 

Well, i didn't. I was stupid and just kept on smoking and before i knew it, i was addicted. How did i ever think i had it under control? That's what smoking does to people i guess. 

Anyway,  enough backstory. I wanna share with you awesome people a graph of my cravings. I feel that the people who just quit will see this and get a clear image on how it can be for you as well. It's different for everyone of course.

I was honest about my cravings. I wrote them down the second they happened. And As you can see, they gradually went down (but still came back, they were never as bad as the one before tough) 

I haven't had a serious craving in a week or two now. I even forgot smoking was a thing for a while. Its so beautiful how i can now make my choices based on what i want, and not what's best for my smoking habits. 

You have all heard this a million times, but it DOES get better. It DOES get easier. And eventually you wonder what the problem even was. 

Have great day, fellow ex-smokers. Thanks for reading

thinking of caving

it's been almost a month.. my counter says 27 days.

life's been so chaotic it's been easy to to follow the routine of "not smoking".  and i know around the 1 month part for me is hard (from prior quitting attempts).  and right now I want to smoke some weed but I'm trying to stop that, so thoughts of cigarettes  pop up.

my addictions are like whack-a-mole, i swear.

quick drinking alcohol, start smoking weed, quick smoking weed, start smoking cigarettes, start smoking weed, stop smoking weed, stop coffee, stop smoking cigarettes, start smoking weed, now stop smoking weed.... so time to start cigarettes?

dear god, what a stupid tredmil I'm still on

and sometimes now I abuse sugar.. like, "oh i'll sit down and eat 100 dinosour candies in one panicked go"

cigarettes would give me something to do, an escape, a way to treat myself as bad as i feel.  "fuck my life, what's the point, just go smoke cigarettes".  But if i did that I'll be smoking a full pack within 1-3 days, ramping up, and wishing I had never started and wondering how i can possibly never quit.

I'm handling my nicotine really good these days - by keeping it outside my body.  i know that about 1 month is when i get cravings, i just need to solder through this part until my days get easier again, because they will get easier.  right now is tough because i feel so much other parts of my life is difficult, so it makes me want to give up on something, on everything, but that'll only make things worse.  i might end the day having accomplished absolutely nothign at work, nothign at home, and a bunch of other nothings.  but won't let it be worse than it started. keeping cigarettes away from me

you can do this. i can do this.

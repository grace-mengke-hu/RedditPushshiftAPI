Relapse

On October 21st I decided to quit smoking. I've smoked for 16 years and have never tried to quit before. I stopped cold turkey, didn't even know my last cigarette was going to be my last at the time of smoking. It was unbelievably hard, but with the help of nicotine patches and cinnamon altoids (3-4 packs a day) I made it through two weeks. It was starting to get easier to deal with the cravings and I definitely smelled better but I missed it. I missed sitting on the front porch swing with my coffee and my morning cigarette watching my kids play and run. It wasn't the same anymore. Instead of enjoying the peacefulness all I thought about was that I didn't have a cigarette. I missed that escape that came when something was making me mad. To be able to go outside, separate myself from the problem and cool off before dealing with whatever it was. I've decided that I don't have the desire to quit. But I need to. Financially I can't afford to keep smoking. 

I've smoked two packs   since since my relapse on November 4th. I used to smoke at least a pack a day, sometimes more. I haven't bought another. I have a vape that helps at times and I'm back on the nicotine patches. My last cigarette was last night. I'm not struggling with it too much today but I've also stayed home and stayed inside. Avoiding my triggers as best I can. I'm a willful/stubborn person but I can't seem to make myself want to quit. How do I get there? How do I make myself quit something that I truly enjoy as an escape when I need it? 

Also, this is my first reddit post. It's not relevant but I figured I'd throw that out there too.

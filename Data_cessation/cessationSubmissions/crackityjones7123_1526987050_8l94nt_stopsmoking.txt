What it feels like to crave

I'm on day 4 of not smoking. My favorite morning routine is to watch the sun come up while sitting on my patio sipping coffee and reading news. The cravings are strong right now because I typically chain smoke while I do it. 

How would you describe what a nic fit feels like? To me it's like my head is full of sand and I'm wearing a backpack filled with weights while something is grabbing your diaphragm and trying to pull it out of you.

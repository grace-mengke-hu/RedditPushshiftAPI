How do I quit smoking when my roommate/best friend smokes?

My roommate and I hang out all the time and we both smoke, especially on the weekends when we sit on our porch with our friends and drinks. She rolls a lot of splifs and always offers me one when she does. How do I change my habits when it seems so engrained in my daily habits? I've been trying so hard to quit and I hate that I do, anyone have some suggestions?

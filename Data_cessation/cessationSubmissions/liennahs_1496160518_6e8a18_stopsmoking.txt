Nicotine Lozenges are the devil.

I quit smoking about two weeks ago (minus giving into weakness a couple times).  As a type 1 diabetic, it is imperative I quit.  I started smoking in 2010 when I took a new management job in retail while I was in grad school.  Also happened to be around the time my marriage started falling apart and it was a habit I mostly picked up from the wasband.  

Anyway--I've been doing really well going from a pack a day to nothing overnight.  I decided to quit before I go on a two week long road trip in about a month that will involved more hiking than my smoking lungs are used to.  

The lozenges (4 mg and sometimes 2 mg) have been working great for me.  However, this morning at work, I took my first lozenge of the day (2.5 hours after waking mind you!!!) and immediately took a drink of water as if I'd just taken a pill.  Annnd, I swallowed it.  About 30 minutes later, I had to leave work for a bit and go home and get naked and lay in a fetal position in the bathroom for about 20 minutes.  I thought I was dying.  There is still some discomfort but it's simmered down.  

Has anyone else ever accidentally swallowed one?  How long did the symptoms last?  I couldn't find much about it online but I know I'll never, ever make this mistake again.

Thank you r/stopsmoking! 62 Days smoke free After smoking for 11 Years. I've never felt better in my life

I saw a post on Reddit front page 62 days ago about some one who quit smoking and he's feeling and looking better then ever.
up to that point i never considered quitting not even once.
so i decided to quit the next day, i downloaded [my quit buddy](http://www.theprojectfactory.com/projects/my-quit-buddy/) for my iPhone that same day and the clock started counting so i haven't had 1 cig since!
I feel way better, and i always thought that smoking helps socially but i was very wrong.
now i can have a conversation with some one without going to a cig brake, or even thinking about it, Now that's **BIG** for me!
I'm never going to smoke again!
Thank You r/stopsmoking/

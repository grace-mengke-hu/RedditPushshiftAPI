HELL YEAH! NEW YEAR QUITTERS UNITE!!! 1 WEEK IN!

This is a big milestone! 1 week in! We DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE PUFF OF SMOKE THIS YEAR! Why? Because we are non-smokers...we don't do that shit!

I have to say, this had been an AWESOME week for me! I can see results of not smoking already.

1. Wheezing stopped. 
2. I can take deep breaths without my lungs going "WTF?"
3. I fall asleep faster!!! Finally!!!
4. I wake up earlier!!!
5. I have way more energy. 
6. I started to workout...and I am more motivated to workout now
7. I have extra $40 in my pocket
8. My hands don't stink
9. My clothes don't stink
10. I don't have to go downstairs at work and freeze my ass off to suck on these lung rockets
11. I gained respect of my co-workers for quitting this shit
12. Quitting smoking made me want to stop drinking. I declared moth of January as booze free. 
13. Quitting smoking made me stop drinking Sugar Free Redbull everyday. That is additional 4 bucks in my pocket. It would be my routine. Redbull and smoke on the way to work.
14. I drink tons of water...over a gallon per day. I piss like a race horse, but my system is being flushed!

This is awesome! I can't wait to see how I feel one month in. That has to feel freaking glorious!

Do not fall off the wagon! Keep at it kids...keep at it.. you can do it. At this stage, this is just a mind game. 

Next two days is a real test. Try to stay away from temptation and triggers. If alcohol was your trigger, do not go out and drink...do not go out at all! Stay home! Binge on Making a Murderer if you haven't seen it. lol...It won't kill you not to drink one weekend.

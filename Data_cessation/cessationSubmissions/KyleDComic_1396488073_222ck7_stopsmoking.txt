Back to Day one

I've been smoke free for about 6 weeks but today I found out a friend passed from MS and the first thing I did was bum a cigarette from a coworker. 

His struggle has made my resolve to be more healthy even stronger and I will get this back. All I have to do now is get past the funeral and all without a cigarette. 

Let's do this friends.

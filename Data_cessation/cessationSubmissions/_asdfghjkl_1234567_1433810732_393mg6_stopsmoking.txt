Day 3. Boom.

It's day three I guess. I technically had a slight smoke on Saturday morning, but quickly quit.

And, before anyone gets super mad, I technically still have my vape. I grabbed it when I was drinking and then quickly misplaced it and forgot about it. I've had the thing with me today, but I'm not really using it. I realize I use it more to just play with smoke. I'm thinking I'm going to go to the Vape store when I can and get a bottle of like 3mg and 0mg... because playing with the vapors is just fun. I imagine I'll have to quit that (is 0mg bad? Studies say probably not). 

I can already see a difference. Or, smell a difference. Or, feel a difference. I'm just hyper aware of my surroundings and the smells and the tastes and the total freedom I have. Oh wait, I can drive in 90 degree weather with my windows up and A/C blasting? Awesome.

Haven't been tempted once. Just.. sick of it. Holy shit the smell of other's smoking is gag worthy. 

Also, finishing Carr's book. about 75% through. 

Just wanted to share.

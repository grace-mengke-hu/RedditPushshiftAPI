I feel very triggered right now

Im going through a smoking crisis, I feel really triggered to smoke. 
Its been a while since last time i felt like this. I think I could be failing a class, one of my last classes before my degree and God I want to smoke so bad.

Also, Im very stressed lately so theres but god knows I cant take a beating on my lunges like I did when I used to smoke. That's my main anti trigger, itÂ¡'d hurt like shit.

Does pipe smoking count? I kinda like the idea and it doesnt pollute the lunges.

Ill just hold on to not smoking,

Help!

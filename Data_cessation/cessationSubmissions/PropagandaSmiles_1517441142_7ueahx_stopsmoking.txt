Quitting Smoking. Best App?

Tomorrow I am quitting after smoking for twenty years. I quit once before for six months and was an absolute nightmare to live with but this time I am going to start vaping and then edge off that. 

I have always smoked rolling tobacco and was getting through a 30g bag in around three days. Hopefully there is an app out there that you can include weight of tobacco smoked instead of amount of cigarettes smoked as I have no idea how many I roll out of a bag. Also an app that has some information about vaping too. Everybody loves stats and badges and all that so I think it could be another help in staying off the smokes

Tonight I was looking around for apps and someone on here mentioned EasyQuit which looks pretty good but doesn't have everything I'm looking for, although I could work around that. If anyone knows a better fit out there for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

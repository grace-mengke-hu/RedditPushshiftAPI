Anyone else never smoked a ciggerrete? (Quitting juul)

How's it going guys. I recently quit nicotine and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's been two weeks but the cravings are still with me. They are gradually getting easier. I'm fairly unique in that I've litterally never smoked a ciggerrete. My addiction began with people vaping in the bathrooms during my last year of high school. It quickly became a fun thing to do at school when I was board. When I turned 18 I bought my own juul. And from that point onward up until I quit I was sucking on that thing every second of every day. And multiple times through the night. I had nicotine in my system habitually. There was no break whatsoever. I was going through a pack to two packs of pods a day. I tried to quit a few times. But failed because I kept the juul. Then I threw it out and went camping alone until I got past the 3 day hump. I'm now very happy to be living my life off that addiction train. Although frustrated to still have cravings. But they are manageable so I'll just have to deal with the consequences of my previous actions I guess.

But I'm just curious if there are anyone else on here who started on, and only every used vapes? We're the first of a new generation exploited by the addiction industry haha. I would never and will never touch a ciggerrete. But juul seduced me and got me completely addicted. And now that I've quit my friends still all have them and refuse to not hit them around me. Which is making me avoid most of my friends. Its shitty man.

I want to know that some things will get better.

I'm so, SO mad at myself for smoking again after having quit for 8 years. I was influenced by a friend who liked to drink and smoke a lot who I looked up to. Not an excuse, just something to be cautious of in the future.

I was the epitome of health and fitness when I started back. Biking 50 miles, running 5k several times a week, even lifting serious weight for a girl. Now I'm sick often (immune system has suffered), get winded/ lightheaded when I lift, and lack all the the amazing energy I used to have.

This is day 3. I look at my face and see wrinkles I now have around my eyes. My skin has lost collagen around my upper arms. My cardiovasular fitness has gone to hell in a handbasket. It's really depressing to think that even though I'm doing the right thing now again that I may have to see these reminders of my stupidity forever. Is it true that you will look younger and healthier from quitting? Will my fitness truly return? I need a little internet hug and hope.

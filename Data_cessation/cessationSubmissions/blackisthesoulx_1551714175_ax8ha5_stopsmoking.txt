Almost 5 months smoke free! Sometimes I forget I even smoked.

I stopped smoking October 11th 2018. Moved onto an ecig, cut out the nicotine and I’m now off the ecig too. 

Can’t even describe how proud I am of myself and how much better I feel. I can breathe so much easier, don’t cough up that nasty shit anymore. And although I used to LOVE the smell of smoke I absolutely hate it now. My downstairs neighbour smokes like a chimney and I can smell it in my kitchen sometimes and it smells like an ashtray and makes me feel sick. Last year I loved the smell and I’d go and have a cigarette. 


My clothes smell so much better. I can smell my fabric conditioner on t shirts that I’ve worn for a day or two where as I could never smell it after wearing it for a few hours. When I put on perfume I can smell it on myself all day.  The stains on my teeth have gone and my gums are looking a lot healthier. 


There are so many benefits! To anyone who’s just starting their journey, keep pushing on to get there. You can do it and you’ll feel great for it. Also the ecig made things so much easier for me and I’m glad I managed to ween myself off it completely. I don’t think I’d have managed to go cold turkey. I have so much respect for those who have quit whilst going cold turkey though!

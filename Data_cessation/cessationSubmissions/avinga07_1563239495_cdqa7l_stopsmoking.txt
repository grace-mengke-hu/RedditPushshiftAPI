11 months and desperate

The past 2 weeks have been worse than my first. I can't even think of what's triggered it but almost every minute is a battle. I've sat outside convenience stores in tears begging myself to not smoke. I'm rationalizing everything and I keep planning my relapse like it'll only be just one.  I've been not smoking just because I'm not allowing myself to, but this constant fighting is exhausting.

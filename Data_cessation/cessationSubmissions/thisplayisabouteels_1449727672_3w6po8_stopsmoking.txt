12 days in, had a dream about smoking

First time I've ever got this far (though I'd only been smoking for four years hey), and had a dream last night when for some reason I bought like 5 packets of cigarettes - don't know why I bought five..

I began to take one out to smoke it, then (still within the dream) realised what I was doing, stopped, and sold the packets to someone else for $40.

Just wanted to share - I found it really cool that I didn't even smoke in a dream. Felt awesome when I woke up!

If you feel like lighting up...try this

It seriously helped me give up 15 years ago. 

\-Go outside with a glass of water. 

\-Take a sip.

\-Take 10 slow deep breaths. 

\-Repeat a few times if needed. (not too fast..you'll get dizzy)

What we forget is that while we are smoking, we are constantly doing a deep breathing exercise. That's why we feel 'relaxed' by smoking. It's not the cigarette...it's the deep breathing. 

I hope it helps you reduce the craving as much as it did for me.

Is a small slip up really that awful?

I used to smoke a box a day for nine years. Recently, on my first attempt quitting, I lasted three weeks - then had a cigarette at a friend’s birthday. That was two weeks ago, and I haven’t had one since.

Having that cigarette didn’t really change much - I didn’t crave cigarettes more, I didn’t go out and buy a box, and I don’t feel bad about it. It was nice, it was a fun occasion and I was drinking good whisky. 

I guess it was “treating” myself to a cigarette like how otherwise healthy people treat themselves to the occasional slice of cake.

I find it hard to see the world so black and white that if I have one cigarette in a five-week period I’ve messed everything up. Life happens.

Obviously I don’t want to tempt fate my being too relaxed with myself, but I think being hard on myself would cause self-loathing and anxiety - which WOULD tempt me to pick up cigarettes again.

Am I the only person who thinks this way?

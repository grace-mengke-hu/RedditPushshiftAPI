First day of the rest of my life

Today I was smoking outside and it feels like something clicked in my head, I don't want to do this. I put my half finished smoke out and when I got back inside the hotel I was staying at for work I put the rest of the pack on a table for someone else and I don't plan on looking back. I've tried to quit before but now is my time I feel it, I recently broke up with my girlfriend who was also a smoker and made it hard but I don't need that stress and I don't need smokes to deal with my pain. I don't know why I posted this but I feel good and I'm hoping the community can inspire me when I have temptations. I'm 22 and male btw and been smoking for 3 years now.

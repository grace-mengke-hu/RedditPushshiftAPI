Day 5 and feeling good and finally awake

I have been sleeping a lot the past 4 days and today was the first day that I felt semi back to my old self.  Interesting enough, I went out to buy 3 computer towers today and went to a subway station to meet the person selling the computers.  I swear that pretty much everyone that came out or about to go in were smoking.  A bit of temptation at first and then I found myself more annoyed than tempted to smoke.

Also, on the positive side of not smoking, my cat has taken to sleeping on me as of last night.

I also gave a friend of mine $200.  I told them that if I take up smoking that they are to donate it to any anti-LGBT group of their choosing. We are both lesbians and I am very active in the LGBT community where I am. She did the same thing with her wife, 4 years ago and she is still smoke free.

I can still taste it

It's been almost 72 hours.  I've brushed, flossed, and mouth washed countless times.  I can still taste the tobacco in the back of my throat and on the sides of my tongue.  I still feel like I have this lingering smokers breath.  It's a constant reminder that I'm a smoker that just hasn't smoked recently.  The taste is strong and stale and returns quickly after eating or brushing.

Had anyone else had this experience?  I don't think I'll feel like a non-smoker until it's gone.

Just started Buproprion (Wellbutrin)... Needing encouragement and experiences.

I had life changes I needed to make, starting back in April.

First, I got a running routine down. Check! I'm going 15-20 miles per week now. It's my "norm".

Second, I cleaned up my diet. Check! My intake matches my output. THIS was rough for the first week. Holy grumpy due to hangry. Wowzas.

Lost the 20 pounds I wanted to lose before starting #3, because I'll for sure gain weight with it. LOL

Now, smoking. My final feat. **Not smoking doesn't scare me. The side effects of not smoking scare me.** So I talked to my doc today and he RXed 150mg Wellbutrin HCL XL SID (Once daily).

Additionally, my dad was recently diagnosed with emphysema/COPD, so that was a humbling reality check that helped kicked my ass into gear (He's 56, 40+ years of chain smoking finally caught up to him).

Can I expect any side effects from this? Am I still going to be a raging hormonal bitch once I cut out cigarettes? Should I quit cold turkey? Wean down?

Tips? Tricks? Advice?

Thank you!

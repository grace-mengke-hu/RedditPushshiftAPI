One month

I made it to 30 days.  I can't believe it. I had moments of wanting to quit quiting and have a smoke. But I just stayed positive.  Now I am so happy I did. I still want to smoke but feeling better is way much nicer. I even had a few drinks last night and I did not smoke. One of my other friend is a week away from his one month of no smoking and all my roomates have slowed down. I just have to stay positive and I will make it to 2 months.

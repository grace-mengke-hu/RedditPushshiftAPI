For those of you that have quit

Can you post for how long, and the differences that you’ve noticed in yourself, and in your life?

I’m trying to find the motivation to quit. A lot is messed up right now. I have little to no motivation throughout the day anymore, so I go to smoke a cigarette to calm my nerves and collect myself, and wind up getting anxiety from it and just go back to feeling useless. Vicious circle. 

Anyways, how have things changed for you? Your perspective, your behaviors, your moods, just your general experience of life?

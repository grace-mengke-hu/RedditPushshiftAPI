Screwed up at day 94. Resetting but I remain resolute.

I made it 94 days without smoking a cigarette and then crumbled for nothing. My ex-girlfriend visited and left a pack of smokes on the patio and I was drunk and I lit one up impulsively. I don't know what possessed me to do that after 94 days but I didn't even enjoy it. Now I have three months in the trash but I am back on the wagon. Tomorrow I will not smoke. I just want this to be a lesson to never get complacent.

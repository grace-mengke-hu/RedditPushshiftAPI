I'm currently an ambassador for my school advocating a smoke-free campus. How should I approach smokers at my school and tell them to stop smoking?

It's my first day on the job tomorrow. I have a few things in mind but I just want to ask for your advice on how I should I do this. I don't want to be that dude that tell people to go away. I want to help my fellow students. Should I bring some gums with me? 
My school does have resources to help people quit.

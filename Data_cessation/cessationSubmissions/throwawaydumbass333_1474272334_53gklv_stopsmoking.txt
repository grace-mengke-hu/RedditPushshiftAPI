Tomorrow was day 8

I caved. Tomorrow would have been day 8. Had an extremely stressful day, so bad it was making my stomach hurt. Very well could have been my bad diet though. Feelin like a dumbass and hoping have no feelings to fiend tommorow. It was also day 7 of exercising everday. The current situation sucks, need to get out of my job, broke as fuck and owe 1500 to a title loan company and just don't have anything to look forward to for a good 3 months. Hadn't smoked weed for 8 days either. A little stressful when that's all you've been for multiple years. Tomorrow were gonna restart. Gonna go 90 days no cigs, no weed, exercise everday, no bad food including soda, fuck that shit, and concentrate on making some money. The one thing to look forward to is an awesome life after I kick everything that makes me feel like shit. Anyways, kinda wrote this like I was speaking to myself. How do I get that badge? Might as well have a reminder to look at how awesome I'm doin. Also, if anyone one else is my position, fuck this shit and let's get outta of it, it doesn't take that long, 90 days is easy once you realize the rewards at the end. The cigs though, are out for life. After 90 days though it will be smooth sailin.

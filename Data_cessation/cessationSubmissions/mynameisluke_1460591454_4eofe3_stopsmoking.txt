Quit full-time smoking 3 years ago, but have still 'socially' smoked since. It's time to end this once and for all.

Hi r/stopsmoking,

I started experimenting with smoking at around 17 years old and picked up full-time smoking at 21. I never smoked more than half a pack a day, but quickly grew tired of always feeling the negative effects of being a smoker. I decided to try to quit over the next two years but was ultimately unsuccessul. Next came Champix, which worked well, but I couldn't follow through with the full 3 month course, as it was wreaking havoc on my stomach. However, it did give me the breathing room to quit smoking for the most part. I've still socially smoked totalling an average of about 12-15 cigarettes per month, although I'll often go a couple of months in a row of not smoking at all. 

My friends all smoke, and at social gatherings, it's almost guaranteed that I will end up smoking, even though I say I won't. I hate not being a man of my word, and I hate not being able to keep my promises to myself. I somehow always rationalize why I smoke and then regret it later when my senses have returned. 

I'm 29 now and I'm just so tired of this cycle, and I need to break it. I'm hoping by posting this, I will bind myself to more than just an empty promise to myself and those around me. I'm binding myself to a community of people who have come here to beat smoking, and who have worked so hard to achieve what they have. I will make this effort as much about all of you as it is for me, and I will not let you down. I will quit smoking once and for all.

Here begins my journey.

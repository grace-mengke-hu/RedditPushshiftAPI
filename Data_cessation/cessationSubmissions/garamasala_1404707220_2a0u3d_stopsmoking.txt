When do I stop missing it?

I'm not sure if craving would be the right word seeing as I'm supposedly past the nicotine addiction but at least once a day I still strongly miss smoking to the point of it making me irritable and miserable. I'm sure I can get past it but when does this go away? I was a smoker for 18 years so I know it's not something that is going to go away straight away but someone please tell me these times of the day will disappear sooner or later? I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life. It's like remembering a dead friend or relative and missing them, I guess I did lose my best friend when I stopped smoking. My cravings only really come in the evening and last for hours rather than just a few minutes that I hear people talk about.

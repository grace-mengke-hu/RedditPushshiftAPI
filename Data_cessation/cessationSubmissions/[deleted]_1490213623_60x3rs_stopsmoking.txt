Nothing changed, except I don't smoke anymore.

I quit 35 days ago. I stopped counting sometime in 3rd week and passed the 1 month mark without noticing. I get 1-2 odd cravings, some days. No cravings while "light" drinking, after lunch, or morning. But that's all, really. My sense of taste and smell didn't improve, (or I didn't notice it), I don't feel happier calmer or better like everyone else. I feel the same. Is this good, or bad?

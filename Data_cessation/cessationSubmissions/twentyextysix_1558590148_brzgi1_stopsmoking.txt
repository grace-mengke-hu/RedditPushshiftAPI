Long time lurker, first time poster

Hi everyone. 

I started my process today. I’m posting here because it’ll feel less like “I’m going to try to stop smoking... again” and it’ll feel more like a first step. 

I know this sub is very pro-cold turkey, but I’m not doing that. If that’s problematic for this sub, let me know and I’ll move over to somewhere else without complaint!

I’m starting my taper down today. I’m cutting my daily cigarette limit in half. I’ve tried cold turkey in the past and it just hasn’t worked at all. 

I’m 9 years deep, in January 2020 it’ll be a full decade of daily smoking. I really don’t want that notch in my belt. I don’t want to have to say “Yeah, I smoked for 10 years” for the rest of my life. I’ve quit 3 times. Once for two days, once for three, and the last time was four days, four years ago. I’ve skipped a day here and another there when I was sick or something, but other than that, it’s pretty much every day. 

My tapering process will be slow, but the last two days have been surprisingly easy. I cut my daily cigarette number in half. The daily amount was pretty absurd. All of my friends who smoke are shocked when I tell them. 

Next step is to cut back two more in a week at the latest. Then two more the next week, and so on.

I’m really focused on replacing those little 5 minute moments every day with other things so that I don’t feel off. I work a high pace stressful job and I’m having the most anxiety about the idea of not being able to walk out of my work and slow down with a cigarette. 

Anyways, here’s to the process. I’ll be posting more with thoughts I need to spill out or stories I need to share to help me change my way of thinking about it.

Cheers!

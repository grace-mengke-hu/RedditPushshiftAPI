Stopped in November 2012

Had zero troubles, I did take a few puffs here and there (and even lit a cigarette once when very drunk, but it tasted horrible) but in the last few months I had zero cravings. The only real trouble I had was some mild depression after about two months.

I was a heavy smoker before, pack a day for 15 years, so I'm really happy. Lost weight too because I replaced smoking with running.

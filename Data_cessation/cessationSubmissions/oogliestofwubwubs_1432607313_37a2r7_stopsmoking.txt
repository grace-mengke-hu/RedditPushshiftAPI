Ya'll, I did it. I made it through the weekend.

I also have begun to say "ya'll" quite a bit after spending the weekend on a mountain in Southern Kentucky.

The drive there was absolute hell. HELL. Twice we got caught in traffic jams and twice all I could do was sit there instead of smoking. That sucked. I fantasized about walking up to someone's car and just bumming a smoke off of 'em.
But I didn't.  

Saturday morning I went into a gas station with the sole intent of buying a sneaky pack of cigarettes so I could hide in the woods and smoke during the weekend. 
But I didn't. Because my father-in-law followed me in, but it's still a win because I DIDN'T. I did NOT buy them. 

Sunday I almost bummed a smoke off of everyone at the family picnic because everyone there (except husband and his parents) smoked - even the husband's 90 year old grandmother smokes.  BUT I DIDN'T SMOKE.  

I am so giddly proud of myself and kind of arrogant right now, too.  Honestly, I"m all "Ha, I'm not a smoker. Fuck you cigarettes, I'm totally winning".  I know that's a bad mind set to have so I scold myself often for my hubris.

Anyway, I'm rambling (because I'm not smoking! ha!) and I'm really fucking proud of myself.

Stop before I even get started?

I'm young, like really young, quite athletic and play various school sports. A few months ago I picked up vaping, it was alright, (non nicotine). But last night, I went out with some friends, started drinking, and some cigarettes were pulled out, after much hesitation I took a drag, I ended up taking 3-4 drags. Nothing major at all. What are some tips you've learned to stop? So I can stop before this problem begins. Thank you.

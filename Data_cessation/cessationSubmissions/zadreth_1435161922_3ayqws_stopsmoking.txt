Best app and advice.

I've finally have made the decision to attempt to quit again, and unfortunately during the most stressful time of my life for various reasons I'd rather not discuss. I've tried vaping, chantix made me insane, and nicotine gum just made me puke. I've tried to read the Allen Carr book, but the way it was written was mind numbing to me. 

I'm thinking of trying patches this time around but don't know where to start with them. I've been smoking from the time I was 17 and am now 35 and nowadays I tend to smoke a pack and a half a day. 

Currently I'm trying to reduce my smoking by whatever amount I can by just telling myself to wait a little longer before I have one. It doesn't help that due to my line of work I can typically smoke whenever I want.  

Really just looking for advice for stepping down with the patches and an app to help me keep track.

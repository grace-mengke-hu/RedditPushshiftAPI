This is my 5th or 6th go at quitting smoking. Who knows if it will stick this time. I gotta keep trying anyways.

I have tried quitting probably 5 or 6 times before. I have been a smoker for about 15 years, and up until 3 days ago was smoking about 7-10 cigarettes a day. I really want to accelerate paying off debts and saving money for a down payment on a house. Likewise, I have two kids, age 6 and 2 and it gets more and more shameful each time I smoke in front of them. 

I have always really enjoyed smoking, which is why it has been so hard for me to quit in the past. The withdrawal symptoms never affected me too severely, its the mental aspect of it I suffer with. I associate so many things with smoking and many things I do I feel are enhanced by smoking. 

I am going camping this weekend and am worried I might crack and buy a pack. Nothing better than sitting around a campfire with a few beers and having a smoke. 

Wish me luck.

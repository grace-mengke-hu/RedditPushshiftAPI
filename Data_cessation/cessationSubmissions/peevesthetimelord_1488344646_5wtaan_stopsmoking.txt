Past the one year mark!

I don't check in on this sub as much as i should, but today I want to make a post. I want to let anyone who is newly quit know that as long as you commit, it gets easier, to thank this entire community for the constant support and advice, and to tell some people who I think will appreciate it: I've officially been a non-smoker for an entire year!!!! 
I can't believe I was ever a smoker. It feels like I was a completely different person when I was. Whenever I pass a smoker now, which happens daily where I live, all I think about as I hold my breath to avoid that shock to the system of inhaling secondhand smoke is how I wish I could convince them that they can quit.
Whoever you are, you can quit. That's what I've learned this year. I have been trying to convince my sister for over a year and I can feel that she is getting closer to quitting. I am so grateful to this sub, y'all really helped me when I first quit, and I appreciate every single person who goes and comments on each others' posts with support and advice. Keep doing what you're doing, never forget: there is no such thing as just one cigarette, and it is never worth it.

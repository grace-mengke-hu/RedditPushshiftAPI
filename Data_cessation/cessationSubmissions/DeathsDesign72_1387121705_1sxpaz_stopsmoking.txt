WARNING!!! Horrific down-side to stopping smoking discovered!

I don't know what I am going to do.  For quite a while now I have been so happy with myself and the decision I made to be a non-smoker. I have been feeling great. It has been so nice not to be relying on cigarettes to get me through the day.   But now... now everything has changed.  I just don't know what to do. I have no idea how to deal with the bitter truth of it.

Since I have stopped smoking, I no longer sound half-way decent when singing along with Guns n Roses while driving in the car :(

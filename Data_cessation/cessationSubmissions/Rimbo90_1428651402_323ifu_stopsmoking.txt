Hello /r/stopsmoking - Suffice to say I'm proud of myself.

Today I am now going into the fourteenth day of my quit. I haven't really been thinking about smoking that much and feel that the less I think about it, the less cravings I will get. I have also took the advice of a few posters on here and started drinking a lot of water.

However, three days in the last week I have met for job interviews. I had an interview last week, a meeting with a recruitment consultant this Wednesday and a job interview yesterday. This was my first real interview since I got my current job, which is about five years ago. And I have probably had a total of three interviews in my life.

I was extremely nervous yesterday. The train I was taking into town was severely delayed and then cancelled about twenty minutes before my interview. I jumped into a cab and got there but all the time my stress levels were going through the roof.

The interview itself was not as daunting as I thought it was going to be but all I could think about was smoking. I really could have done with one to settle the nerves.

I rode it out and not only did I not cave, but I also got a callback yesterday to say I got the job (which is the first step on my career ladder).

I do not know whether I am more proud of myself for getting the job or for not smoking in the stress-inducing situation. I feel that if I will not smoke during a time like that, then I have no reason whatsoever to smoke in the future.

Thanks for reading!

CT/NRT debate, no hate within

TLDR: thanks for existing all of you - 52 hours in, left work to buy NJOY, rush of nicotine->dopamine, guilty

Smoking for shy of 7 years. Found this sub at work two days ago hitting random button. Read EasyWay pdf and decided to stop the next morning because I had never had so much momentum. Found whyquit.com, and have been reading that stuff too. Withdrawal has been noticeable but not so bad - feeling empowered, feels good to tell people. Have been waiting for that 3-4 day mark when my brain will be nicotine free, but I feel like I just majorly fucked up.

I get that the e-cig is inarguably not as harmful as combustible tobacco, and I do not feel like I've somehow let down Allen Carr or Joel Spitzer. I don't have any judgments to make about how anyone else deals with quitting. It is just that reframing the thought "I want a cigarette" into "I am accustomed to servicing my nicotine addiction," has been working. And it seriously felt so ridiculously familiar after two hits that I freaked out. I feel like I've undone the last two days. 

I am interested in feedback - I think what I really want is not to be addicted to anything. I understand others have a different goal. Anyway, things had been pretty easy and I was going to just keep lurking here but I feel super weird so I wanted to post.

Thanks everyone.

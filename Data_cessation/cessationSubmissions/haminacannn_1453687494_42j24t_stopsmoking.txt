I'm really craving a cigarette today and I'm wondering if I should just buy some juice and vape...

It's been almost 40 days nicotine free but I'm really craving some nicotine. I want to cheat and use a vape but I dunno if I should be taking in any nicotine at all 

Thank you everyone for your comments, it has helped alot!

Quitting Tuesday, here is why. Tips and advice please

If I could go back in time, I’d kick 18 year old me in the ovaries. I had a very rough time my first year of uni and nicotine was a great escape. I didn’t buy cigarettes, I just got them from friends, stole a couple from Mom so I thought ‘hey, I’m not an addict, it’s not like I spent money on them’. Until I did, and I’d spent the last money on them. I was fucking insane. When it was the end of the month and money was tight, scholarship ran out, Mom and Dad can’t help, I’d obsessively search my room and collect pennies to buy them a piece from a shop that was kilometers away.

There is really no reason anymore to smoke, I’m bored and I light up a cigarette, it passes, I barely feel it. I went from a martial arts student, ballerina and singer to out of breath after a flight of stairs and sounding like an old chain-smoking grandma.

I want to quit because I want my chest to stop hurting, to stop sounding like Gollum, to stop coughing up phlegm and to stop spending money on it. I want to stop looking tired and for my skin to stop looking yellow. With the money I spent on cigarettes, I could take spend a holiday on some beach, buy myself a new wardrobe and still have money left. So I’m going to take the money I put towards cancer sticks that are gone in two minutes each and I’ll put them towards buying myself something big. 

Also, my dad had a health scare, thank god it wasn’t anything like that, just a polyp that took two surgeries to get rid of and 1000€ in medical bills but instead of quitting, he kept on and became my enabler. We’d make up reasons to go out together and hide cigarettes in the car. We’d steal from Mom’s packs and hide them in a secret spot. We even had a signal that someone was near so drop the cigarette. 

I want to not feel 70 at 21.

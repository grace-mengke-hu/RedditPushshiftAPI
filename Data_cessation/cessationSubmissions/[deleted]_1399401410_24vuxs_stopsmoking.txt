What worked for you?! Please help :(

Okay, so I am 25 years old and I have been smoking since the age of 12. I have "quit" many times but always go back to it. 

My step-father passed away 6 months ago from lung cancer, you would think seeing him suffer so bad would be enough for me, but it wasn't. 

I have tried all sorts of stop smoking aids; the patch, gum, e-cigarettes, cold turkey. 
I really want to quit so badly. I feel terrible all the time. I have a 1.5 year old son, and I don't want him to be exposed to it (through my hair, clothes etc) 
I am making a big move across the country at the end of this month and maybe think it would be better until after the move before attempting, we are driving so I imagine it will be very stressful. 
Any tips, tricks, or advice would be so appreciated. What worked for you?

You don't actually want to smoke a cigarette , you want to get rid of the distress that craving is causing you!

Originally wrote this for r/pornfree but this can be applied to every single addiction. Edited it a bit so it can fit here too.  
Let's be honest here, if you really wanted to smoke cigarettes you would be doing it without feeling any guilt. You wouldn't even think about quitting and most definitely you wouldn't be on this subreddit. You wouldn't be trying over and over again to end this addiction!  

The truth is, deep inside of you, you know you don't want to do this anymore. You want to stop because... (you all have your personal reasons).  
   

So, when the craving for cigarettes strikes, what you really want is to get rid of the distress this craving is causing you to feel! You don't want to smoke!  
  
You always feel bad after you do so! You did not want to smoke that cigarette, you just wanted to get rid of that distress craving was causing you to feel.
Sure, if you light up that cigarette you instantly feel better, you get a temporarily relief because that craving is gone but you are back at square one. As long as you keep doing that you will stay in the endless circle.

Now, I know how bad that distress can be, it can make you feel like you must get rid of it or you will die!It feels like you have no **CHOICE**. But that is a big fat lie. You do have a **CHOICE**!!  
You can either smoke that cigarette and repeat the same cycle over and over again or you can **CHOSE** not to, and do something else instead!  
I don't have a magic pill, we all have to go trough the same distress, but there is no other way. It won't be easy, but keep in mind **NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, THIS CRAVING/DISTRESS WILL PASS!**  
It will pass either you smoke or **CHOSE** not to.  
Staying with this distress suck because of our CURRENT bad brain wiring, but it will get better and your brain wiring will change. However, you need to do the work and stay with that distress.  
I have remembered one good video I've seen recently, its about Urge Surfing, you have probably heard about it before.  
Here is the video from that guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqFGfy6yvig  
This change of attitude has helped me to get back on track after my yesterday's relapse on Day 74 (pornfree), and I am pretty sure I am done with porn this time!  
About me. I do know how bad those cravings can be. I have struggled with cigarettes for years. Was smoking for 10 years, but most of the time I have hated myself because of it and tried over and over to stop doing it.  
Eventually, I did it. I don't even know the exact date because of the countless failed attempts. But I can tell you my cravings are completely gone and I am free for probably 4-5 years.  
Good luck to everyone here. As long as you want to change, I firmly believe you will succeed one day.

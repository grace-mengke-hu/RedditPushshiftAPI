Day 10!

Well, I've made it to day 10. I feel better for the most part but the cravings do get the better of me from time to time. I don't have withdrawal side effects like headache &amp; extreme anxiety anymore but I've had cravings bad enough that even just now I considered stealing my coworker's cigarettes out of his drawer at one point.


I didn't obviously, that's rude but there are a few smokers at my work and sometimes I fantasize about how I could just take one and no one would know...then I think about how ridiculous these thoughts are and how fiendy I sound. If there was any question about us being addicts...haha.


Anyway, it IS getting a little better day by day though, so everyone stay strong!! We can do this. I can't wait to be at a point where it's not so important to me, i'm jealous of non-smokers that can just go about their day and not feel ruled by that little death stick.

Why didn't anyone tell me that smoking causes erectile dysfunction

Like really! Alas, I think I might have smoked myself impotent. TMI but I haven't had morning wood in maybe 2 years. And I can't keep it up while standing up. I finally decided to quit about 17 days ago, in hopes of salvaging my sexual health (and maybe living a bit longer too). Really just looking for some comforting words from some ex smokers whose boners have come back from the brink of destruction, or advice on how to live with a lifeless pile of warm goo between my legs. Maybe I'll become a monk or something.

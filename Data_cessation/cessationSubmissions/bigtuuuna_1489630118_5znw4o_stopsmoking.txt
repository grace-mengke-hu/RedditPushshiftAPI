I've had some success and wanted to share with you guys!

So, for 10 years I've been smoking and really felt that deep feeling of remorse and knew I shouldn't be smoking cigarettes. It took me days and terrible nights of thinking about it before I really came to a realisation that I can't continue my life while being a slave to the cig. I told myself one morning that I was going to go into my nearest gym that had what I wanted and sign up. Fortunately, my old coworker worked at the gym and advised me that my lower back and lethargy was due to poor exercise and also smoking cigarettes. 
I signed up at the gym. It was terrifying! I never thought I'd step foot into a gym let alone run or push myself. It began as a series of self doubt situations. But soon, I realized that this wasn't a place of judgement or showmanship, it was about a collective people deciding to feel better and be supportive. 
I have now been a week without cigarettes, and 2 weeks at the gym regularly, and I feel top! But...
I also purchased a vape to help ween off the cig. I've heard every side and argument for and against vapes, and to me, I haven't felt better. Yeah, you're still inhaling, but I feel like going to the gym has been a nice detox. Try it out. 

Tldr; go to the gym, and try a vape if you need to. Life is better without cigarettes and exercise is possible

$100 bucks!

So I just got back from a walk and along the way back I pass the gas station where I bought most of my smokes. I mindlessly walked in. I get to the counter before I realize "fuck I quit".  Now I'm standing at the counter looking like an ass, "umm, umm... light bulb! lottery tickets get lottery tickets, Fuck it you're here get scratch ticket too!" And Woohoo I won $100 on the scratch ticket. Anyone else do absent minded shit like that or am I just an idiot?

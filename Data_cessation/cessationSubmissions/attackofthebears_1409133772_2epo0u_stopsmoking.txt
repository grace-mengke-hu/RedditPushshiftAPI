taking the first steps.

hi all long time lurker, i've been smoking for 3-4 years now and i've tried to quit more times than i can count. The health warnings and labels have never bothered me, likewise cancer and disease risks havent, and probably won't give me the incentive to commit to quitting. 

I dont know why, but somehow i always end up needing to having a ciggie whether its going down to buy one or just bumming one from someone on the street. For the majority of the past year i've woken up to a cig and a coffee, and always have to have 'one more' before i sleep. anyway most people on this sub can probably familiarize with the various habits that you pick up. Im at a point where I can start doing something but ill get a craving to smoke and wont be able to finish anything else until its satisfied, like my eyes will start to water and my mouth will feel dry etc. 

On the flipside when i get chest pains ill quit for a couple hours or days but after it goes away ill have a ciggie happily. I want to quit but sometimes it really feels like smoking adds balance to my life and when im not smoking, I'm uncomfortable like im missing something.
I dont really know what to expect from posting this, and from other posts in this sub it seems like getting over the hump is the hardest part, but yeah I'm sure quitting is for the best. 

Sooo.... What advice do you have for getting past the first couple days? and how do you get past the feelings of dependency??

4 Weeks

My breathing is better, My sense of smell and taste is better, and my anxiety is reduced. I did about 30 min of cardio yesterday and it was easier but I can still tell I have healing to do. A bit of chest pain near the end but it was somewhat high intensity.

I don't really think about smoking as much even though its only been 4 weeks. For those at the beginning your fear that you'll always have cravings will be reduced over time. The first 3 days are the hardest. I went from pack a day to cold turkey quit, I feel that other methods ptrolong the misery.

Also I've decided to quit alcohol too now. I'm 4 days in and I think this will be even harder actually.

Happy New Years! May your resolutions stay strong.

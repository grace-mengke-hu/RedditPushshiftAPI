Anyone in the service industry? How'd you quit?

I've finally decided to make the commitment to a healthier lifestyle and my first step is to quit smoking. But,  my problem being the service industry is packed full of smokers and I have shamefully picked up the bad habit and passed it on to my girlfriend. Can you give me some tips of how to quit? Any fellow industry works have advice to share that helped them to quit? 

My only downfall is smoking during or after a shift, otherwise I'm pretty much smoke free.

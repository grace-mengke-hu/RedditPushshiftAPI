This burning cigarette unites us

I really had this feeling to quit smoking in my mind. Everyday I used to open my eyes from the bed with this pledge " no smoke today". However everyday evening I hangout with my friends for the past 5 years and all we do there, having fun talking, teasing and smoking. I think hanging out with them is my addiction more than that of smoking. On one hand I really enjoy being there and other hand I regret to break my pledge everyday.

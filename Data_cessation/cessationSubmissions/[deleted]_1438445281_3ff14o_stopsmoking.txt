Spending the day studying - If you have concerns, worries, fears, or want advice, I'll be on my computer all day!

Saturday can be the day of calm, AKA nothing to keep busy at and want to smoke. 

Or, it can be the day of drinking and hangovers and wanting to smoke.


I will, more or less, be at my computer for the next 8+ hours. If you find yourself struggling, wanting to talk, or any random thing (I can try and talk about random subjects), feel free to comment here or message. I'll be a sounding board. Just know that there is at least one person in this world that is actively hoping you don't smoke, and wants to help.

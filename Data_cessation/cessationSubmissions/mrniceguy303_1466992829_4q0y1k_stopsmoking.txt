Post-quit depression and anxiety

Hey all, day 8 here. Wondering about ways that have worked for you guys to handle bouts of anxiety and depression while quitting, and how long you experienced them? Was tobacco part of a deeper rooted problem or maybe it was the root cause of many life problems?

I have been pretty active before and during my quit so far, and I have tried to rekindle some old hobbies and take up new ones. All this has helped a ton, but I still get down in the dumps sometimes.

Would love to hear anyone's input. Thanks!

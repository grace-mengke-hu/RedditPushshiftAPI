Weird sensations in my chest after attempting to quit

I have been working on quitting smoking, for the last several weeks, after about a 10 year habit.  I have started noticing symptoms that have been unlike anything I've experienced in the past when I quit.  I'm having sensations in my upper chest that are hard to describe.  I almost want to say a flutter, almost like butterflies in my chest, mixed with an itchiness or tickle.  This feeling isn't constant, but keeps happening sporadically.  I'm not sure if this is related, but I also feel like I constantly have mucus in my throat.

I was curious if anyone has experienced symptoms like this after quitting?

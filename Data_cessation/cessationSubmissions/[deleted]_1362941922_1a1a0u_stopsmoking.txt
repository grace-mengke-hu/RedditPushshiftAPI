How long has this gross stuff been in my sinuses, and when will it stop? (+happy story)

First things first, I finally quit for real this time! I know because yesterday I hung out with a smoker friend and watched him smoke five cigarettes without even asking for a drag, much less bumming one. The first time he lit up, it was pretty hard, but after that I started to enjoy it. I couldn't stop smiling like an idiot, just walking down the street next to a guy smoking a cigarette. I wanted to stop people walking past us and be like, "hey, see how that guy's smoking? Well, I'm not! Look! LOOK!" I deliberately went out for a smoke break with him once-- just to prove something to myself, I guess--and stood there drinking my coffee and felt nothing but the pleasure of chatting with a friend. Hell yes.

But there is the matter of this yellow/grey/clear/weird/gelatinous goo coming out of my nose at regular increments. I had a bad cold when I quit (and I quit because I was sick of getting a full-blown sinus infection every time someone sneezed within a mile of me), so that probably makes this part of the process worse, but I've seen a lot more posts here about the cough than this. Did anyone else's nose go crazy too?

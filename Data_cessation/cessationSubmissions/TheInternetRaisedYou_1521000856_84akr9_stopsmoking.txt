Could I use oranges to stop smoking?

I'm trying to replace the habit of smoking with another, healthier habit. If I could smoke weed like cigarettes, there is no doubt in my mind that I could quit. I live in an illegal state, however and it can get expensive. I've recently grown an obsession with eating halos and full-sized oranges and I think I could use it to stop smoking. Are there any repercussions for eating so many? Of course, I would make adjustments to my regular diet to allow for so many oranges and I would honestly try to cut back more and more as the first initial cigarette cravings are exorcised out of my system.

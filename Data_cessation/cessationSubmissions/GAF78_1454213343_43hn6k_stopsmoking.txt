52 days. Sometimes it's still hard. Most of the time it's not.

It has been 52 or 53 days since I smoked my last cigarette. I used a vape, very lightly, for the first 27 days. So it's been 25 days of zero nicotine, 52 with no cigarettes. 

Sometimes I feel like I could smoke one longer than my arm in about two drags. A few days ago I had lunch with two smoker friends of mine, and they didn't smoke, but on the way into the restaurant we walked through a courtyard where we used to hang out and drink and smoke, especially in our younger days. Two men were having cigars out there. I have never had the inclination to smoke a cigar-- and it would be weird for a woman, I think-- but it smelled good, and the men looked very carefree.  I felt a twinge of jealousy. 

The last week or so has been extremely difficult in terms of personal stress for several reasons. My ex husband was involved in an accident, I've had some exceptionally stressful things happening at work, and so forth. I have caught myself with a clenched jaw, or gripping the steering wheel, grinding my teeth, tensing my shoulders, etc. I even chewed a hole into the inside of my lip. Today was the first time I considered it. I imagined the taste and smell, and knew that if I stopped and bought a pack I would feel normal for a few minutes. I also knew that I would be chained to it again, would feel embarrassed about my status as a smoker, that it would stink, and that this stress will pass eventually. 

Deep breaths help. Talking to others who have quit helps. The smoke free app helps. Drinking water helps. Knowing I've come this far and that the worst part is far behind me helps. 

I'm glad you're all here. Keep sharing your recovery with me.

Finally, one week without smoking!

I've been smoking since I was 14, I'm now 21.  This is the first time that I've truely made the commitment to quit smoking on my own.  It's been a week now and I've noticed so much change since last Monday.

* I can smell my shampoo and perfume
* My husband's kisses taste better (I'm sure mine do too :))
* I can smell things that I never thought had a smell...like just being outside
* I WANT to be active
* Taking deep breaths doesn't hurt anymore
* My skin has completely cleared up...not one blemish
* My skin was aparently grey...because it's MUCH brighter now
* My fingernails are growing and getting stronger

These are just a few of the things that I've noticed about myself over the past week. I still get headaches and angry ragey cravings...but it's getting better and I'm not going to let it beat me.  

In fact, one of my proudest moments happened over the weekend.  My sister-in-law was having a smoke...I decided to test myself...so I stayed around...I literally couldn't stand the smell of it, let alone want to smoke it.  It was a really awesome feeling :)

Sorry for this long rant but I felt like this sub would understand because I don't really have anyone around me that smokes, or that has quit smoking!

I keep failing myself

Hi, all. I've been a smoker for 11 years now. For the last few years I've been smoking 3-5 cigs a day, basically exclusively while on my ship. (I'm active duty Navy). Feels like it should be easy to cut it out. I'm at the point where I'm telling myself I'll quit bi-weekly and I usually make it just fine from Friday till I go back to work Monday. Then it's same old habits. I really hate being on that damn ship. I'm a few months from getting out of the Navy and I've pretty much mentally checked out. A smoke is a pretty good escape from the bullshit. I'd really like to quit though. It's slowing me down physically. 

It's Monday, I smoked 3 today. Threw away my half empty pack. I don't want to smoke tomorrow but it's almost like I don't believe myself.

So... I failed. Get me back on track, Reddit!

I haven't smoked for nearly seven months and didn't miss it for a second. Quit cold turkey.

Some time ago, I had a hard time in my life, a little burned out and including a breakup, that didn't go lightly on me.

Long story short, I caved, full relapse, I'm smoking way too much right now and I hate myself for it.

Motivate me, insult me, do what you can, Reddit, but please, get me back on track. I need a little wake up - call again :)

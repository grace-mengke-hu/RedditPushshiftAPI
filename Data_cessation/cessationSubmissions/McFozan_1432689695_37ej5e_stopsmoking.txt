Been smoking for 2 months. Am i addicted? Also, smoking affects fitness?

Hello,,,



I started smoking cigarettes about 2 months ago. It started with 1 with a friend. Second day i took two. The third day i took 6. The 4th day i bought my own packet( its what we call it here in Saudi Arabia :D ) and i started smoking regularly. With friends on smoke breaks and alone after i wake up. After food and right after i wake up are my favorites. I tried to stop for a day but seemed to have urges to smoke one the day after.. 
I can stop smoking if i am like in the house for a day or two but if im out i just smoke.. 

I am planning on joining a gym tomorrow and im concerned that it will affect my performance with cardio and such stuff.. Although my concerns are for my health i should ask about the gym one :p 

Am i addicted? It doesnt seem serious but i dont want it to be.

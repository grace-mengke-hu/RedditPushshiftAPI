I'm trying (again)

About three months ago I posted here that I was going to quit. If you knew me, you wouldn't be surprised to learn that it didn't work. However, I am on the path of smoking fewer cigarettes. My peak was 20 a day. Then I got it down to 10 a day. And now I'm between 5 and 7. I hope that this will eventually lead to me quitting for good. I'm actually thinking about getting back to the good ol' e-cigarette. Already tried it a few times. I didn't quit, I just replaced an addiction with another. However, I didn't have bad breath and I didn't stink anymore, so that's a plus. 

Anyway, happy holidays everybody. Congrats to the ones who managed to quit and good luck to the ones who are trying !

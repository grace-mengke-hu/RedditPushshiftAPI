Keeping the momentum going?

I haven't had a cigarette since Friday at 8:30pm. I've been using nicotine lozenges to at least help until I can break from the physical ritual from smoking. Cold turkey didn't work several times before because I've always enjoyed the physical act. 

This effort is going much better and I've reduced the number of lozenges I'm using. I've been overall excited about my progress this time around.

But for some reason today has been a bit of a struggle and the excitement is dwindling. What methods do you have when you have moments like these?

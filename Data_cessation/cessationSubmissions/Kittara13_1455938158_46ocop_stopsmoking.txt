Just getting strarted

So I've been smoking casually since high school, and regularly in the past 3 years. Started dating a heavy smoker and working in a bar where it's easy to smoke. So I've been smoking a lot lately, drinking a lot and I know it's bad for me. I caught a cold this week and decided this is a good place to start quitting. I didn't smoke for 3 days and I started feeling better. I had 3 drags a few minutes ago, nicotine felt good but it really tasted like shit. Made me want to quit even more. I'm just worried about my boyfriend, my work and my will power.

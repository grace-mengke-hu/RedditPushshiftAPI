Tingling hands and feet 28 days into quit -- normal or am I cooked?

Hi all, lovely to be part of this community. I'm 28 days into my quit after 3 years of half-a-pack per day between the ages of 18-21. 

I am feeling quite good. But I am experiencing one thing that's making me concerned: once every couple of days, I get a tingling in my hands and feet. Doesn't last for long. But it's definitely there. I'm young and quite slim, which is why I find it disconcerting.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I am seeing a doctor early next week to rule out any serious health concerns like diabetes. Just want to hear others' experiences.

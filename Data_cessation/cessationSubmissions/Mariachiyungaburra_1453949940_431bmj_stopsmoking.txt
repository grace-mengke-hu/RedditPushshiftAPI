Travelling Wilburys and a shot of tequilla

Quit yesterday arvo while listening to a great song and with a shot of tequila. It was a nice way to have that last bit of nicotine. Allen Carr's book is what I have put my faith in and so far it's working :) leading up to the last smoke, during and just after is a bit full on, but I made it through.

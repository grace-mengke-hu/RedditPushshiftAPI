Stress is making me want to smoke!!

BUTT I don't want to throw away my 45 days of freedom, BUTT I really want to smoke!!
My chest is tight with anxiety, that i know smoking will NOT help, BUTT I really want to smoke!!
Oh F**K it I am away to bed.....the stress will still be there tomorrow but hopefully a sleep will enable me to cope with it without smoking! Rant over.

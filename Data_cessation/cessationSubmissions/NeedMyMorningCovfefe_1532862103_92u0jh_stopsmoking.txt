I finally get to write one of these posts!!!!!

I made it guys, I fucking made it. 1 year - 365 days not even a single puff, zero tobacco!

I will not let my guard down, not even a second. My last quit before this was for 9 months guys, 9 months and I had one fucking cigarette at a party and I was back to 20 a day immediately. Never letting my guard down again. 

Advice?

1. Don't wait for a special date to quit, I used to always try and quit (I've tried hundreds of times) on a special day like a birthday, first of month, 7th of the 7th month, New years day, silly shit like that. Don't, every day is the same, the earlier the better. 

2. It's going to suck, deal with it. Be honest with yourself, you know it's going to suck, you know you are gonna have withdrawal pangs, you know your brain is going to give you 1000 reasons to smoke. When this happens, realize it's part of the game, laugh it off if you can, if not just accept it sucks so bad and move on - drink water, deep breaths, move on.  
I used to say to myself ''HA! Fuck you brain for trying to trick me into smoking you bastard, not falling for it this time!''

3. Don't victimize yourself. This is your battle and yours alone. As we said it's gonna suck and that does not give you the right to be a grumpy bastard to anyone. No sob stories, no ''oh it's my first week of quitting I'm irritable'', these are all excuses your brain gives you to go back to smoking. You are the same person, act like it, tackle the quit like a champ and don't pull others down with you because your having cravings. 

Good luck guys, I do not think about cigarettes hardly ever anymore - you know the draft - it's better on the other side bla bla, you already know this, you already know how shit smoking makes you feel. 
You got this, I know it's tough but it's worth it and there is no better time than now to do this. 
90% of it is mental, there are no physical pains. Hardest thing I've done but thank you Lord I'm now past the year mark!!

3 months Today! Feeling positive

So glad I've got through the worst and coming out the other side. Had a crap time at the beginning feeling poorly tired and drained. Had some bad craving hours  not minutes lol but I feel proud I didn't cave in to any of that because now I hardly think about them! I know this time I won't go back just have to get through it if and when it rears its ugly head. I will be ready. Keep at it peeps not one puff !!

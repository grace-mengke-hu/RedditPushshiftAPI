The Final Cigarette

I've been reading this sub for a long time and I'm ready to finally take the jump. I've already practically destroyed my gums and teeth and I'm ashamed at the mere thought of having to go to a dentist. I'm 31 and I've been smoking for 15 years. 

Rather than focus on my past mistakes and my previous stupidity, all I can do is focus on getting better and not living living everyday in shame and guilt. I've finished Carr's book and tonight is the night I suck back my final cigarette. Wish me luck!

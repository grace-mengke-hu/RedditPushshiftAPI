Day 3 of being cigarette free. Anyone else who has quit smoking get nasty flu-like symptoms or insomnia?

I've been a smoker for at least 6 years and have just recently given it the flick. All my friends and family smoke and I'm finding it hard to talk about how I feel and what I'm going through with them. Would be nice to hear other peoples experiences with quitting!

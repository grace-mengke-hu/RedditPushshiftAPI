Unexpected issue preventing me from quitting.

Hey everyone, I'm 26 and have been smoking nearly a pack a day for 9 years now. I finished med school last year and am currently doing my residency. Recently I decided it's time to quit smoking for good, made a few attempts but only managed to last between 36 and 48 hours due to the following problem: looking at blood while in the operating room started causing shivers down my spine, my knees became soft and I felt like I was going to faint. Bought a pack of smokes immediately after that and everything was back to normal again. Smoked a few weeks, then made another attempt but the same thing happened and so on.

It's really sad, because I feel the cravings I experience are totally bearable and will be a breeze to overcome. My appetite didn't increase either. I've seen the most gruesome murders, accidents and rotten corpses during forensic medicine classes at the university (inches away from me, not pictures) and didn't even blink. Now this ... and avoiding the OR is not an option.

Anyone experienced anything similar? Every tip on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated.

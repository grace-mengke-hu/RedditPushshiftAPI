It’s when you first say no to your smoke buddies.

I have been trying to quit for a long time and have been 14 days off it. What really helped was that I learnt to say no to those 1 or 2 cigs that someone offered. That really helped strengthen my own resolve. It’s really difficult as you are friends with a few people just because you smoke together and getting through that really helps.

I broke

This is not an inspiring post, if you came here to read about a story of victory you should turn back right now.

I quit smoking a little more than a year ago, but I snapped back into it when my relationship ended today. I don't really plan on trying to quit again too, since I did it to be alive longer and that desire is pretty gone at the moment.  
  
Like I said, this isn't a cheerful post. This is however, my last post on this subreddit. For a while, at least.

If anyone can help me deal with this, I'm all ears. I'll see you guys around.

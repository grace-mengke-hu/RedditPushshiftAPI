Quitting Patches Today

Hello all.

I actually haven't had a cigarette in nearly 10 months. However, I've been stuck on the 21 mg nicotine patches (or the "big boys" as I like to call them) the entire time.

I've tried getting off them before to no avail. I made it past the three day mark once but then a switch or something went off in my head and i found myself at Walgreens buying more patches 10 minutes later.

Anyway, I was seeing if maybe someone has had to deal with a similar situation.

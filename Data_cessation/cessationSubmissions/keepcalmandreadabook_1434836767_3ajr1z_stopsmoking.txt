I would have smoked last night if I found cigarettes.

...and I don't know if that means I should reset my badge.

I was really high last night and being high is a trigger for me because I used to always smoke a bowl and then have a cigarette. It's been getting easier, I haven't been around stoners that smoke ciggs, so I've been learning to ignore that trigger, but last night I couldn't sleep because I was stressed out about [some stuff that happened yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3aj7p5/things_got_weird_i_26m_barely_prevented_a/) so I literally invaded her so when my ex GF fell asleep I went through her purse trying to find a cigarette. I didn't find one, and even though I was high and craving, when I went to lay back down I felt good and proud that I still hadn't smoked. I wondered if I would have smoked if I would have found one, I'm pretty sure I would have, but I'm so thankful now that I didn't. I kept thinking about how it wouldn't even taste good because it's been almost two weeks and all the nicotine is gone, and I realized what I really wanted was that "ahhh this is relaxing me" facade that ciggs provide. When I realized that I went to sleep.

I woke up today and felt so much better, meditated and am about to work out, and when I went to take my laundry out I saw a can of cigarettes outside. Normally when I smoked, if I was desperate, I would invade people's refries real quick... so fucking gross... but I did it all the time. I think my lowest point was picking up refries off the ground right by a dumpster in my apartment complex, once. Fucking gross.

Anyways I'm just glad I made it through. How is everyone else doing with not smoking? Should I reset my badge?

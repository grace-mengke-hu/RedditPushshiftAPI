I think I might quit.

Been slave to these things for over a decade. Such relaxing benefits - but that's the only benefit. I'm trying vaping instead, but it doesn't feel the same. I've quit before, only to pick it back up again. I think the longest I've quit in my ten year span was 54 days last year. Only thing I've got is cigarette butts and I'm trying to picture my cigarette butts with dirt all over them, just trying to visualize. It would me me feel good if I got support, and I know there's others here trying to quit, too, so take care of them first. I'm telling myself over and over "get addicted to the ecig!" Also using Smoke Free as before. I think the thing that tripped me up last year was stress. Here goes nothing...

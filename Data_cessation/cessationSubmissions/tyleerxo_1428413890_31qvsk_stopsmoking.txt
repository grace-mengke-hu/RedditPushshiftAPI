I've finally got a star!!!

Never thought I would ever make it but i've made it a whole month!! I feel so good and it feels good to be a non-smoker!! 

Big thanks to this place as honestly wouldn't of been able to do it without it! Check every day and it gives me motivation to continue down the right path so thank you everyone :) We can ALL do this

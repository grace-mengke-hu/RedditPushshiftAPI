Emotional/psychological wreck

Im on 3 weeks today! Im hoping this gets better because omg I cry all the time right now.. about anything really.. i also have moments of rage where I just want to scream at people .. its terrible.. I can’t stand to be around my friends anymore either. They all annoy me at the slightest thing .. even though they are all very supportive.. I got to yoga everyday, hot yoga, which helps .. today my intention was to start being “nice” again... and it was a great class .. about 3 hours after though I felt the rage again towards my friend who “didnt give me enough notice or invite me to lunch “ I get super passive aggressive... I just dont kno if I like the person I am now that I dont smoke... Im not sure what to do.. annd I dont even miss the smoking anymore.. i think it smells terrible .... But I am having a hard time adjusting to this non smoking life style.. I literally feel like I hate everyone and everything.. 
can anyone relate?

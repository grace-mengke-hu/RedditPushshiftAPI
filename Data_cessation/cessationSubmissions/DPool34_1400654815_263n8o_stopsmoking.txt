Am I missing something with The Easy Way?

First of all, to be fair, I haven't finished the book yet. I'm 80% of the way there, and I fully intend to finish it. I know, I know... finish the book before posting you idiot. I don't have the book with me right now, and was just thinking about it.
I feel like I'm missing something. 
Granted, the version of the book I have is a free e-book. It reads pretty rough, which I'm sure is the fault of the editor (or whoever typed up this copy). 
Is it just that the strongest points are at the end of the book? I've heard nothing but good things about the book, so I guess I just feel like I'm immune [thus far]. 
So, I guess what I'm getting at is should I just start the book over with an open[er] mind, or should I just continue reading from where I'm at?

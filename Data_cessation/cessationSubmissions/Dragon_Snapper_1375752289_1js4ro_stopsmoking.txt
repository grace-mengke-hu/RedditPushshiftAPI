273 days

I didn't realize how many days it had been till I signed up here. The days have turned to weeks and now to months. This is the 1,895 or about time I have quit, ha ha ha, but seriously the second time of any duration, the first being over 3 years.

I just want those that are just quitting to know that YES it does get easier, take it one craving at a time. And YES it is easy to get back to smoking even easier. 

A few more months and I will be celebrating the one year mark............ again. The changes, being able to smell better,taste better, to no be so worried if I smell like an ashtray. I can't stand going by a group of people who are smoking, makes me want to gag. I can't believe I actually smelled that bad and didn't notice it,ewwww,lol

My mantra is " Smoking is NOT an OPTION" the first time I quit I had signs all over the apt with all the different chemicals that are in cigarettes written on them. Signs with all the negative aspects of smoking. Yet, many I didn't even know until I quit, like the tastes buds not tasting,and not smelling things as well. Hmmm oh well,enough about me and my ramblings, good luck all

Tips for the dreaded smoking bar?

This weekend, I will be at like a week, and there is a good chance that I will end up at a bar that my friends and I go to often.  If it is not this weekend, it will be the next. If not that one, the following.  They smoke, and it is one of the rare bars that let you smoke inside and they don't have a real patio.  

Why I can't just "not go:"  My friends are hospitality workers, and hanging out at a bar is really the only place and time that works for them. By myself, I can go to work, go home, not think about it too much. But at a bar surrounded by cigarettes, will be a different story.  I am sure everyone is familiar with the "if I just bum one...." mindset that never works.  And even if I don't go this weekend, eventually I will. 

Tips? I have considered the obvious of trying not to drink much, particularly sticking to beer as much as possible. I fear that even a few beers would be enough to do it though. And they don't have a real outside area or non smoking area, so I can't get away from it. Any suggestions or tricks would be appreciated.  Thanks

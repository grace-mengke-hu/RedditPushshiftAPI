Benefits of quitting: My sense of smell has improved

Drawbacks of quitting: My sense of smell has improved.

Holy shit. I feel like a basset hound. I feel like I could track a yeti in the frigid peaks of the Himalayan mountains through scent alone. I suspect I could hire my services out to a police department as a tracking dog. But these superpowers come with some drawbacks.  For instance...

I used to dip (quit smoking and dipping at the same time).  I was getting the faintest whiffs of something foul for the past few hours, till I decided I'd investigate.  Turns out I had a fermenting dip cup hidden on the far side of my printer.  Who knows how long it had been there.  And holy shit, it stank.  Woof.

Also, I've since learned that my dogs really need a damned bath.  I bathe them once every other week already, but that is not enough.  Not since I developed bloodhound level scent receptors.

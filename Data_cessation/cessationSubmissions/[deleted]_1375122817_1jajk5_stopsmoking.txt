Help for the weed

Hi guys!

I'm doing fine so far. I have been able to beat the addication monster inside of me for 9 months now! And I'm so glad, I owe so much to this community! Thank you /r/stopsmoking

Now I must confess that except for the last 9 months, I smoked weed all my adult life, and I still want to. 

What do you think? Could I smoke a pure weed cigarette?  Could I do something else? 

I was gonna smoke a joint, and I stopped myself and thought "I should ask the reddit community first", so you guys tell me what you think.

Good luck to all of y'all just starting to quit smoking. It's worth it!

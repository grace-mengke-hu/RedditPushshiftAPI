Something I said to my good friend that inspired him to quit.  I hope it can do the same for anyone having trouble.

You ever hear the phrase fake it 'til you make it?  

You usually hear it for people that want to be body builders.  You go to the gym once and you feel like a fucking boss.  It inspires you to go back.  You've entered the mentality of Arnold goddamned Swarchenegger even when you're still just as skrawny as you were the day before.  But the mentality changes you.

It's the same way when quitting smoking.

**You're not a smoker trying to quit.  You're a non-smoker who's tempted.**

Every day without a cigarette isn't "a day you didn't smoke."  

It's just another fucking day.  You're a non-smoker now.

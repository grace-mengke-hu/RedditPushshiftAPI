Ugh. Day 5

Iâ€™m on day 5 . Iâ€™ve pretty much laid in bed and or cleaned my house for 5 entire days. I finally drove today and almost caved . By far driving is the worst. I also have not seen any of my friends. I canâ€™t be around anyone that smokes right now. 

When will the mental fucking be over. Iâ€™m emotional and angry but Iâ€™m so ready . I think . 

Part of me also wants to say hell with this it really is hard . ðŸ˜­

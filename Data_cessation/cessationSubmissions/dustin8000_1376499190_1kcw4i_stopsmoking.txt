Quitting again... day 2. I've done it a million times so i'm getting pretty good at it.

I just found this subreddit so i figured what the hell. 

My longest time quitting was 3 years... I've smoked the last 3/4 months. It started like it always does... a cig here a cig there. Next thing you know i was buying packs again. 

 But i think i just had to get it out of my system so now i'm attempting once again to quit. Let's see how it goes. Good luck to anyone else trying the same.

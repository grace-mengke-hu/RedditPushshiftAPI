7 days of FREDOOOOOM

Today I mark my first smoke free week. It's not much and I'm still at the beginning, but today it was difficult, I almost slipped so I'm using this post to get some hype and keep on going.

Edit: Thank you to all you guys giving me support. Today I learned what a great place this subreddit is. 
    Oh and i'd like to brag a little bit more about how i just manage to endure two hours in the company of a heavy smoker friend. I just followed your advice and kept thinking of how awful cigarettes are.

Just checking in.

It's been a while...I'm still going strong. I just want you guys that are starting out to remember that soon you will not even think about cigarettes. I used to come here every day. My conversations to friends would be "I've been a whole 'x' amount of days now without cigarettes!"...Eventually you stop thinking about it completely. 

Do it for yourself. Do it for your loved ones.

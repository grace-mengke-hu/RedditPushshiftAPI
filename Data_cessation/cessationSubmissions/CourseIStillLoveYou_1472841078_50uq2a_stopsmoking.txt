One Week In. Currently on a trip w/ a bunch of people who smoke

It's kind of awful. They smell really bad. The resentment felt towards me not wanting smoking in my car is palpable. It makes me realize just how filthy this habit is, and as weird as it is to say, I need to make more friends who don't smoke.

I can smell smokers now

A week into writing and I can now smell what others smelled when I was around. Was on the elevator with a few of my previous smoking buddies and some other people and not to be an asshole but DAMN it felt great not being the stinky smoker. I don't judge them but now I know what it was like for those around me who weren't smokers. I feel like I just showered at any point in the day. Love this feeling! It's the small things guys :)

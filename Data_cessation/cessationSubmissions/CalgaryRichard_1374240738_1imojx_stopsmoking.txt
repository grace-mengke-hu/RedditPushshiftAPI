2 months, and this has been the easiest thing in the world. I am not even sure why I am subbed here.

I read Allen Carr's book and haven't had a cigarette in 61 days.

I see cigarettes the same way I view alcohol (I am in long term recovery-17 months sober).  This really has been pretty simple.  Day 1 was not the easiest (I was told I was a bit of a bear by a good friend with whom I spent the day) Other than that I don't even think about it.

I am going to stay subbed here, but continue to not read anything here.

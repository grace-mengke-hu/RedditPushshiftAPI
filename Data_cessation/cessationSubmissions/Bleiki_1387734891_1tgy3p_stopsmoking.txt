Champix (Varenicline)

Hello All.

I have tried a dozen of times to quit smoking,longest was a week.
Tried alot of diffrent methods (dont want to try patches,Gum or E-cig)
and failed horribly.

Recently my friend who was a big time smoker told me about a champix,some medication he was trying out to help him quit.
he was successfull so i tried to give it a go,on my 4th day on the meds so far and just wondering if any of you have any expirence with it and willing to share ?

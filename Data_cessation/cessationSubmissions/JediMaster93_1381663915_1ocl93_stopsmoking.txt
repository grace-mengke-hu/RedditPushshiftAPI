Caved in after 49 days.

And everything was going so well... I always felt like I've quit without too much trouble. I should have figured it wouldn't be that easy.

Went to a party yesterday and just said "fuck it" and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I'm not gonna lie guys, the first 2 puffs felt absolutely divine, completely out of this world. However the other couple of cigarettes were absolutely terrible and completely reminded me why I stopped smoking in the first place. So I am not as depressed or disappointed as I thought I would be. In a way, this was a great learning experience. 

No where to go from here but to day one cold turkey again. Don't make a stupid mistake like I did guys, and keep doing what you are doing!

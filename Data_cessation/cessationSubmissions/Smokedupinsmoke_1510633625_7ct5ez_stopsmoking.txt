Smoking dream

Two and a half months smoke free and I had my first dream of smoking last night. It felt so real and the genuine dissapointment I felt for smoking in the dream felt real as well. I dont know if its because the year is coming to an end or if Im experiencing more stress that the dream occured now. I do not have any cravings. My main motivation for quitting was and still is the money. I've saved about $250 and all that money is in a savings account.

I was a pack a day smoker and most people who have not seen me in a while can not believe that Ive stopped smoking. I thought if I could get to one month I would be free but I got to two and weird things like this dream is happening. Will have to find some posts on this sub to convince me otherwise. Ive seen some posts of people having the smoking dreams. Might shed some light.

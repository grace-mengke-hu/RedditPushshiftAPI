Survived the family visit!!

I am at almost 2 months!! 
A lot members of my family smoke so I was nervous about spending a 3 day weekend with them.  To my surprise I not only had zero desire to smoke.  2 members of my family decided to follow my lead and quit and that pretty much caused the rest of them to hardly smoke at all while we were around.   
  It was a beautiful thing!!

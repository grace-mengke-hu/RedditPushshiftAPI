How long is feeling ill normal for after stopping?

Currently on day 11, been feeling as if I want to vomit and sleep is more or less a pipeline dream at the moment. I know I am at the bad end of the the side effects of giving up but was just looking for advice on how long to let it go on before I see a doctor.

When does that empty feeling go away?

Hello everyone, 

I quit 10 days ago. So far it's been good. I'm using NRT and its helping a lot. However, there's this nagging feeling of emptiness, like something is missing. 

I don't really miss cigarettes, I know I'm addicted to them, so not one puff, but the annoying feeling of lacking something is really bothersome. 

I was a pretty heavy smoker, pack a day for 15 years, so quitting it's not  exactly "easy" like Allen Carr made it out to seemâ€“at least not for me. But I do have several failed attempts to quit under my belt, which have given me sort of, I repeat, sort of valuable tools to find it manageable this time. 

But the emptiness! The emptiness is really annoying. How long does that feeling of "needing", "missing" something lasts?

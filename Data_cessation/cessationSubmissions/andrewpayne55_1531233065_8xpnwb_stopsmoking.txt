6 days, passed my first major hurdle and feeling good

I'm on day 6 today and feeling a lot more confident than previous attempts. I decided to stop drinking on the same day this time. I don't aim to stop drinking permanently but it feels like a necessity to stop me from smoking at the moment. Last night was my first true test as I had to go to a rock gig for a review in the evening. I stuck to water all night and was even able to stand in the smoking area talking to people without craving.   


Thanks to everyone in this group for the support and advice, I have lost count of how many times I have 'quit smoking' and this is the first time in a very long time that I actually feel as though I have stopped for good.

What happens in month 2?

Hey folks - long time lurker.

I smashed month one and feel fantastic about it. Newbies, it gets easier and the cravings do fade. Not quite disgusted by the smell of stale smoke but I'm really glad I don't produce that now and I consistently reject cigarettes that friends try to tempt me with. 

Bad news: Month 2 is feeling like a bit of a bitch. Cravings aren't as intense but I have noticed I am quite lethargic, still don't have great focus and am prone to eating more. Also experiencing a fair amount of backpain and fluey cough type symptoms. Any tips to help this or wisdom on what to expect? 

Much love guys. Keep going! I never thought I'd truly manage this after 10 years but I have and you will too :)

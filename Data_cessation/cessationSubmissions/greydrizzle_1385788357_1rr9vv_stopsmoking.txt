Dealing with someone else's withdrawal symptoms

Don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I am hoping someone here can offer some insight. My SO recently quit smoking. He is very irritable and gets bad headaches. While he doesn't necessarily take his bad mood out on me, he is unresponsive to conversation/normal interaction and is not pleasant to be around. 

I obviously want to be supportive but I am finding it hard to stay positive when he is not. Any suggestions on how to handle the situation? Even things I could do that can make the process easier for him would help!

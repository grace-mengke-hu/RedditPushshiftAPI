Anxiety question

Its been about a month and a half since i quit cold turkey, i never had anxiety before i started smoking but once i quit i had terrible anxiety and couldn't step out of my house for almost the first month. Its slowly becoming better, I went to all my classes last week and felt fine but there will always be a day where i get a panic attack out of nowhere and then feel funny for the next few days. I feel much better from what i used to feel like, and the doctor told me everyone heals in their own time. But I'm becoming impatient and wondering..when you relapsed did that anxiety go away with it? Also what are some good ways to stop it from effecting my day-to-day life? Also could the reason i had one out of nowhere today be because of my sleeping patterns? I hear at the 2-3 month quitting time people tend to get depressed and i think thats whats causing me to have very bad sleep. (lay in bed for hours before being able to pass out and always waking up) Could that be why I had a panic attack?

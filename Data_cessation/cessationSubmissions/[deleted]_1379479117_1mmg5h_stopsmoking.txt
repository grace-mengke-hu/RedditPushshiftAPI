Guilty pleasure?

I've done really well with not smoking. Gone from a pack of 16s a day to pretty much none with the help of Champix (Chantix in the US). However, every now and again on a beautiful day, I like to sit outside in the sun with a book, an iced tea and have maybe one or two menthols to just indulge myself. The last pack I got was a 26 pack 50 days ago and it's lasted me to now with still 20 in the pack.

It's only once a month but would you guys consider that cheating? My husband thinks it's fine while my aunt always says "I thought you'd said you quit! You liar! Nag, nag, nag!" I'm just curious what your thoughts are on it.

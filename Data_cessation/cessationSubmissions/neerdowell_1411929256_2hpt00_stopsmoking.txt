How to get through cravings at work.

I've been up and down with quitting lately. In the past, I have used patches to great success, but have never been able to do it. I ran out of my last batch of patches last week and told myself i wouldn't slip. Four hours later, and unable to focus at work, I went and bought a pack of cigs. I need to stop now, but work seems to be where I always slip up. I work in a subsidized housing office where about half the staff and about 75% of the tenants are heavy smokers. Going into work tomorrow, what are some strategies I can use to get through the day, manage my cravings, and maintain focus on my work?

How do i stop?

I've been smoking for about 3 years and frankly im getting tired of it. The constant craving, the smell, spending money on cigarettes.... i honestly don't know why i even started. But inspite all of this i cant stop myself from buying another pack every day. Some advice would really help me out a lot.

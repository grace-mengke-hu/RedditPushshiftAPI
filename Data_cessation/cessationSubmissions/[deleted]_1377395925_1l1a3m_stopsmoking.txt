How do I quit when having access in my home?

So, I used to snus. I didn't really want to quit nicotine, but I didn't have a reason to continue using it, and I saw that the money spent on it wasn't worth it.

Quitting that actually went fine enough, I really wanted to buy it each time I went into a store, but I wasn't able to bring myself to do it. The problem is that my mom smokes. So each night I steal a smoke from her. I just got home from a five week visit at my dad's where I didn't use any nicotine for the duration of those five weeks, but once I got home I stole a smoke from my mom.

When I didn't have access to nicotine, I was able to stay away from it, even though I had some terrible cravings, especially at night (how do you get those to go away?), but now I'm having difficulty doing that. 

I'm only using one a day though, so It's not that bad. I'm also considering moving out, as my room is a shitty loft in which I can't even stand upright on regards of the walls angling into the roof. Sorry I'm rambling.

Recurring Cigarette Dreams

I'm almost at 2 months! Damn, it's so much easier now than it was at first. The cravings are rare and have become surprisingly manageable. 

The weird thing is that since I quit I've had these recurring dreams where all of a sudden I realize I've smoked most of a cigarette. I don't remember lighting it, I just look down and there it is. Feelings of shame and regret flood over me instantly, I think "Why the hell did I do this, why did I think this was worth it?"

Then the feeling of guilt sticks around after I wake up but it takes a few hours or sometimes a couple of days to realize that I feel guilty about smoking a cigarette that I didn't actually smoke. It's a bizarre sensation. Like, I KNOW that it only happened in a dream but the visceral feeling of regret lingers.

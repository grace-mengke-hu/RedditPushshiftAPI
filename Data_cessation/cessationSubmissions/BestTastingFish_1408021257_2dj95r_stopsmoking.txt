I believe tomorrow is the day.

Hi guys and gals, 

I believe that tomorrow is going to be the day that I finally give up the cigarette. 

Recently, my life has taken several encouraging leaps in a positive direction, including a good paying job, graduation approaching, re-inspired Faith, etc., but the one thing that still remains that I want to change is smoking. I've smoked for just three and a half years, but at a pack a day level. I hate the smell, the expense, etc, and my SO does as well. I'm looking to put it behind me for good for the sake of all of the positives I've found.

I've tried tapering off before, as well as cold turkey, and neither method worked. Recently, my father's pack a day smoking habits of 36 years exacerbated a heart condition and nearly killed him. He underwent surgery and was even defibrillated at one point. I'm sure the episode made him reevaluate his mortality, and he quit immediately with the help of a nicotine-less eCig. I would also like to use this option, but I'm going to use nicotine in a tapering fashion.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a good quality eCig, tips for tapering off, and help for fighting cravings?

Thank you in advance for your suggestions,

Would have slipped up if...

In about 4 hours it will have been 72 hours nicotine free. The past few days have been hard, but nothing like this. I actually drove to the corner store to buy a loosey since I only have 3 dollars (lol ik) and try were closed early, I became enraged and asked some friends if they had cigarettes I could buy, but nobody answered. I think that was the universe telling me not to slip up, however, all of the sudden it's become hard to resist smoking and I'm afraid that tomorrow morning I will go buy some cigarettes, it's just so hard and I have no way to make it any easier.

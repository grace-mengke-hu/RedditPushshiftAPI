Wondering how common this off/on pain pattern is, anyone else experienced this?

Early 30's woman, been smoking off/on (mostly on, many short lived quitting attempts, few days to few weeks each) for about 11 years, pack a day on average. 

What I have noticed is that while I am smoking regularly, I will wake up with chest pains, congestion, cough something fierce (sometimes until I vomit), but after I have been up a few hours and had a few cigarettes, the pain/coughing/congestion all goes away. The longer into the day (and therefore the more I smoke), the symptoms all clear up. I still feel fine at night and falling asleep. Wake up the next morning, and I feel like I am dying again.

So every time I try to quit smoking, what happens is that on Day 1 I wake up and feel that way (pains, coughing, congestion) but don't suppress it (or however it works) by smoking (since I'm quitting), and things get very alarming and very weird, very fast. Then my preexisting hypochondria kicks in, I start doing online symptom searches and just about start tripping balls.

I am currently on Day 5 of this attempt, and am basically using a batter-down-the-hatches approach this time. I haven't even left my house in 5 days, try to sleep as much as possible and have binge watched nearly every episode of the walking dead while murdering packets of Trident. 

The coughing in the morning has stopped, and the is congestion gone 90% of the time, but a couple times per day I hack up a chunk of grey jello jiggler from the depths of my lungs, which I like to believe is a good thing in the long run. The hacking it up and out part. 

However, the pain is only getting worse and weirder. And part of why it is weird, is that I know that if I smoked, then the pain would go away, as that is how it has always been. Not that this means I should smoke (duh, I shouldn't) but just that it's weird like that. 

I get pain in every area of my chest, different areas at different times. I get pain in my back. One shoulder blade, then the other, then in between. My neck is **crazy** tense, and sometimes I get feelings like electrical shocks down my arm, or the bones in my arm hurt. I've experienced this craziness every time I have quit for a few days or more, and it's back again this time, too.

**Plus** there is the on/off feeling of having a heart attack like 5 times a day, which is a wild ride of anxiety and sudden surges of weirdness. I will just be pacing around the house, and suddenly I feel "strange", then break out into an anxiety-induced cold sweat, then check my pulse repeatedly for an hour, then my upper back hurts and I'm like **OH SNAP THIS IS IT**, but then I am still alive 24 hours later and watching the walking dead plot and character development go further downhill. 

Has anyone experienced this? The pain stuff? The possibly-real-possibly-tripping-balls heart attack stuff? Did it get better? Weeks, months? Never? 

I have an appointment to see my physician, just cuz, but I know she is going to tell condescend me and tell me everything is fine and that everything is normal. But she's not an ex-smoker so her words are meaningless and I'm just going to badger her for a chest x-ray. Any actual ex-smokers that know what I'm describing I would love to read from you srsly.

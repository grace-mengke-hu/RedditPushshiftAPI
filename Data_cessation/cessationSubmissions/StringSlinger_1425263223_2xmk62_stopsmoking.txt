I quit smoking while working in a smokey bar.

If I can do it, so can you!

If you want to quit and haven't read the Alan Carr book yet, that's all that's standing between you and freedom! It really helped me. It gave me the confidence I needed to quit while I was surrounded by smokers on a daily basis.  

35 days and counting!  It feels so good.. my breathing is so much easier.  My blood pressure is lower, I feel much more relaxed and generally at peace.  I'm able to concentrate more, my sex life saw a huge boost from my increased stamina.. and <ahem> better circulation.  

The first three days were a challenge, but I wouldn't say they were difficult.  I was a pack a day smoker for 17 years and quit cold turkey, surrounded by smokers.  

You can do it!

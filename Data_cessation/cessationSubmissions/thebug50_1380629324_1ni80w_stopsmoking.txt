I feel it this time...I'm a non-smoker!!

Over the course of my 11 year pack-a-day habit, I've tried to quit a handful of times and never made it longer than a week.  When I joined the Navy, I was forced to quit for a couple of months but bought a pack the first chance I got.  I never felt like a non-smoker.  I was always just holding my breath till the next puff.  Not this time.  I know there will never be another puff.  I'm finally free and it feels fantastic.  Thank you Allen Carr and thank you r/stopsmoking.

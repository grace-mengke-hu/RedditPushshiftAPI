Horrible withdrawals after 2 weeks of quitting smoking

hello all! I quit smoking 2 weeks ago, since then my physical state has been on edge. First it started like a sore throat, some coughing and nasal congestion. I was prepared for that - a Quitters Flu. week after - i got better, but then two nights ago i woke up with chills and shivers. High temperature all night. i took meds to reduce the fever, but it seems to come back when meds wear off. this is the second day now. really weak and barely can walk. Has anyone experienced this? It doesn't really feel like a real flu - i've never had fevers for this long, without any other symptoms. I cough - yes, but it doesn't feel like bronchitis or anything either. 
Anyway - just hoping that it's my body trying to recover. 
The only good thing - i completely have no desire to light a cigarette. just a thought about it makes me sick. that's after 12 years of smoking.

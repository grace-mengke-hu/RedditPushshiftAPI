Thank you for the support !

This is my first post on any public forum as I was so moved by the support given by everyone in the comments that I felt compelled to contribute. In particular this site has been incredibly beneficial in my own battle to quit - thanks to all who contribute and for the support it has given me.

Like many of us I have been struggling to quit for many years with many failed attempts. This time however it feels different and I have learnt what works for me from my numerous failures.

I am now 21 days in and still have days where the stress of work and general life gets to me but I am not giving in. 

As we all know the whispering calls of cigarettes are always there, but for me I have found success using multiple distraction and trigger avoidance techniques. I have also accepted that whilst the triggers and cravings get easier to deal with, they never go away.

The biggest advice I can give to anyone is to hang in there and find what works for you. In my opinion you also have to give up for yourself and not because someone else wants you to. 

I still have a long way to go, though I am proud that I can now go to bars and parties and not be tempted to smoke.

I hope this helps people in some way. As they say 'Where there is a will there is a way' !

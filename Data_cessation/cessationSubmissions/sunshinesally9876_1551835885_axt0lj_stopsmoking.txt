Does anyone else get tired of the continual struggle?

I know how far I have come but at times it is a real struggle not to give in and just have a cigarette. I know I canâ€™t have just one! I know that having one for me means I will be back smoking a pack a day within days. I donâ€™t want to be a smoker but I am so over this continual inner struggle not to have one. I really fear that I will never get past this! When will I stop thinking about smoking, having one not wanting to have one. It is just so tiring! I wish I had never started in the first place!!

Just a vent, no need to comment ðŸ˜«

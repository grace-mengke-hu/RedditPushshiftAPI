My unusual experience

I have smoked for 15 years. I've gradually diminished in one year but without any control/discipline/method (I was not counting the days, how many cigs smoked, etc). This means that I hadn't decided to stop, it has happened _naturally_, I was just not in need anymore.

After several months (last pack was during this spring,  I don't remember exactly when but I've chosen the 1st of May for my badge...) I've understood that what actually happens is that the psychic factor is very important and often underestimated in addictions. One day it happens, you're just free (i.e not a slave anymore, not _alienated_ anymore by the product).

Often the environment you live in is just not the best to stop because you really need to get rid of all the stress and the habits related to the usage...Fortunately I'm a bit at the margin so I had no problem with work overloads, no problem with hierarchy pressure at work, no problem with people, etc so I suppose this has helped much to stop _naturally_.

I ask to people who can't manage to stop: does your environment at least allow you to stop ?!

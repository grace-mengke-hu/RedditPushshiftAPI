Two Years Smoke Free Today

I just want to thank everyone here for sharing. I think that reading about all the successes and failures have led me here. At first when I quit I thought about smoking every minute, then it was every hour, then it was every day. Now, weeks go by without it even crossing my mind. Honestly, the hardest part was the fourth day. From there it got easier. Good luck to everyone thinking of quitting.

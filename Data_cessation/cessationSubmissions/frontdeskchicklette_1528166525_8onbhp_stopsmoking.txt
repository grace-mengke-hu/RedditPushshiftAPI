3 years and 3 months of the ultimate freedom

So March 1, 2015 I laid down my smokes for good. I went thru cold turkey hell and came out on the side a new woman. After 27 years of smoking 3 packs a day I quit. Forever!
Now, I never want a cigarette. Not after I eat, or when I'm driving, or after sex, or with my coffee. 
I think the thing that kept me from going back this time is that I recognize my addiction as just that... A real drug addiction. I still feel so pissed at myself for allowing that addiction (and to a drug that didn't even get me high) to hold me in it's grip for soooo long. 
These days, I'm totally free. Quitting is the hardest thing I've done. It's also the kindest, most loving thing I've ever done for myself. 
So embrace the crazy, breath though the hard moments, and you will come out on the other side, totally free, forever.

Quit Cold Turkey 3 Days Ago

I started my "quit" journey last Friday with NRT (Patches), but I took off the patch on Tuesday and never put another one on. It's been a little over three days with NO NICOTINE...but I find my self wanting a smoke soooooooo bad...I'm trying to get past the craving right now--so any tips would be helpful...

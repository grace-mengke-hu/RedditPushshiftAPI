Recommended Evening Primrose Oil for female hormones?

I told my manager on saturday i had quit smoking as i knew she had given up 2 years before so I knew i had someone at work to support me. She mentioned evening primrose oil to help with hormones??  I did buy some and took one (can take 4 a day)  but was wondering if it was really beneficial. Im 2 weeks in today and havent been super irritable. 


Does anyone have any input on this please?

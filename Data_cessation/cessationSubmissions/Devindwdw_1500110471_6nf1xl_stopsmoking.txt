Not feeling good

I quit almost 4 months ago. I had a really tough week and I bummed about 3 cigs a day off guys a work with (never actually bought a pack) I just feel so down after how good I have been doing and I feel like I've failed myself. I feel like I'm starting over and that's the worst feeling but I know I need to do it to better myself so here I go.

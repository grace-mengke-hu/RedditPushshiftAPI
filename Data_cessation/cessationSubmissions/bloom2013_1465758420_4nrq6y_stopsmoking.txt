Day 1, again. But this time it's cold-turkey

I was so disappointed in myself from having lapsed after four weeks without smoking that I went on a self-destructive, four day long binge (three packs a day) and basically undid all the progress I had made. I won't even go into how shitty I felt after that.

I have quit and relapsed before and part of me feels like if I don't do something different this time, it'll just be the same depressing vicious circle. So, to force the change upon myself, for the first time ever I'm going cold turkey. 

It's been twelve hours.. and I'm terrified. It's still really manageable, although I'm scared to leave the house lol. Right now it feels like the calm before the storm because it's been so easy. ANY advice would be fantastic since I haven't done this before!! Especially on how to ride days 1 to 3!

So far, I don't really have to leave the house at all and I got myself plenty of water and cranberry juice.

Stop smoking app Mission accomplished

So here are the things that worked for me:
1.  Stopped on day 1 of a 4 day weekend
2.  Used a little nicotine replacement. ..lozenge in the morning and e cigarettes in the evening.   
3.  Veggie booty
4.  Told everyone for both support and shame if I smoked
5.  The stop smoking app really helps. ...I am smoke free for 20 days 9 hours. I have saved $140 so far!

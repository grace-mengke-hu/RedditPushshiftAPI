2 months smoke free, quit zits intensifying

does anyone know the real reason this happens?  how long does it last usually?  i'm starting to get the big painful red ones under the surface, my back is covered in acne, my face is breaking out and im worried that it won't go away.  this happened last year when i quit for a month, but now its been two and as far as cravings go i think im doing better, although i do still use  patches for about 8 hours a day, but the acne is just getting worse and worse and last night i found myself entertaining the idea of getting a pack of cigs that i don't even want just to see if it would go away. does anyone have any suggestions?

Tomorrow will be my first day as a non-smoker!

I'm ready. 

I quit smoking the entire time I was pregnant two years ago but started back up soon after. I quit last year for 40 days and then my anxiety got the best of me. I quit last month for three weeks, but my willpower disappeared.

The first week is always easiest, but once my lungs are clear and the coughing is gone, that's when I crave one.

Any tips or advice? ðŸ˜€

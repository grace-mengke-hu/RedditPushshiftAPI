Day # 10 update...my poor bike...lol

So I have made to day # 10.  Yay me.  I feel so much better now that I have made it thus far.  This past Sunday, I went to an event and decided to bike there which was only like 2.6 km away, each way, but the best feeling was going up hills and not being totally out of breath.  I am planning on bike ride today to downtown and back plus some extra stops along the way so in total I should be doing around 6 - 7 km total.  Feeling so good and happy. Thank you all for your support. :)

Finally removed from the cycle.

I stopped smoking a few days ago after reading Allen Carr's Easyway. 

Honestly, every single person in the Subreddit needs to read the book. Maybe you quit one month ago and still yearn for a cigarette every once in a while. Maybe you've "tried everything". Maybe you are constantly coming up with petty reasons and rewards to make yourself quit. You *need* to read this book. Do yourself a favor and remove all of the "trying" from the equation. Just quit. Just quit because you get nothing out of it and it kills you both mentally and physically. The book will help you really put your finger and all of the reasons why you've wanted to quit and how you can achieve it.

I've 'tried to quit' or 'been quitting' countless times. Sometimes days. Sometimes weeks. Sometimes even months. Today is only day 4 since I actually smoked my last cigarette but mentally I feel months and months beyond that. It's not naive. I think about cigarettes every day. I see someone smoking, I have a bad day, I'm sitting around bored, etc. I just don't want to smoking anymore and it doesn't take a logician to figure out that means you should just stop. 

Read the book. Honestly. I'm a huge skeptic. You will already 'know' most of what the book tells you but it's an enlightening and cathartic experience. **Plus it's only like 100 fucking pages and will change your life forever.** How much easier could it be?

Anyway. Everyday I look forward to waking up one day further away from years of smoking and years of trying to quit. I no longer fear quitting or fear smoking again.

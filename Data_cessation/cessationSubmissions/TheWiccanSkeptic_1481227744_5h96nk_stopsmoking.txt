4 days with no smoking, best injury ever!

Last Saturday I broke one of my ribs. It isn't a bad break, but it makes a lot of things more difficult. When I went to the VA to have it looked at, my doctor let me know that most smokers will develop pneumonia after breaking a rib. It took me a few days to stop entirely, but now I'm done with it.

I am working on day five today, and I'm already feeling so much better.

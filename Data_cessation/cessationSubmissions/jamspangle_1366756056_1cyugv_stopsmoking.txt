The oddest thing has happened

I have smoked for over 20 years. Heavy smoker, tbh. Gave up on the 20th of March with Champix, 3rd try with this stuff, have noticed more side effects this time than the other 2 times but have stuck with it, not one cig since i quit.

Then yesterday, whilst walking the dogs i felt the weirdest urge, well it's alien to me - i wanted to have a little jog. The last time i was required to run was over a year ago and i was a little bit disturbed to find i couldn't run more than 10 meters without being fully shagged out. This is one of the motivations to stop this time actually. 

So yesterday i did have a little run, it felt good (although i am glad that i walk the dogs in a fairly remote bit of woodland - wouldn't want to run for the first time in a decade in public!) Today i ran just a tiny bit further.

I'm still getting cravings for a cigarette, but won't, as i'm finding i quite like being able to breathe.

TL;DR quit smoking 5 weeks ago, recently felt the need to run and was able to!

Don't be afraid of not being able to smoke

Hi guys. I need to share something with you. I was a really heavy smoker until with the help of all of you I quit smoking cigarettes. But on my recent visit to Cuba I tried some cigars and you know what? I do smoke them occasionally. I have nearly no addiction. I mean for a fact I can easily go without them for a day or two. Nothing like cigarettes which I needed every hour in best case. And the only reason I can't claim that I am not addicted at all is that I still have some supplies left and enjoy them whenever I have a drink. But still, I think my life experience may help those of you who are afraid of quitting. Don't. You can socialize with your cigarettes smoking friends while being much cooler looking  cigar smoker and have no remorse the next morning. I am not resetting  my batch yet. I still have a dozen of cigars left. One trick though. You must become a non-smoker first, otherwise you will just inhale them as a regular cigarette.

Tl;Dr quit smoking without of fear of not being able to smoke ever.

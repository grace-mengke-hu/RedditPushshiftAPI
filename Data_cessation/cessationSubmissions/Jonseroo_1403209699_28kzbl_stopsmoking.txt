Lived with smokers in my twenties. They mocked me wanting to be healthy. "You could get hit by a bus tomorrow!" Now in our forties, one has skin like Lando Calrissian's copilot, the other has cancer.

Mind you, they're both thinner than me, so they've got that going for them.

Sorry if this seems flippant. I can't send pictures of them back twenty years to warn them, so I thought I'd come on here and say something instead.

Short story for you all because i found this sub while random redditing

found this sub by hitting the random button, anyways, here's my story:

I've been a smoker for a while, probably the last 5 years. i'm currently 20 years old, but i cough like i'm 70. i decided that i needed to quit, and soon, or else id change my mind. 

my friend jordan had been telling me about how he was bettering himself during the days of lent, and that every time he cussed, he'd put a quarter into a jar and donate it to the church when lent was through. 
i told jordan that i didn't practice lent because i'm not religous. but jordan challenged me. he said "Then don't do it for religion, do it to better yourself, or poove something to yourself. just get off your .. uh.. butt and do something for the sake of doing something!"

so i sat down during lunchtime and gave it a thought... what could i do to better myself? Then i had an idea. Jordan's swear jar! i'd do a cigarette jar! after lunch i stopped by jordan's room and asked if he'd like to help me with my plan, and here's what i came up with:

Every time i smoked, i would give jordan $5 to do with as he pleased. i needed to make it high enough that i wouldn't want to do it.  so far, it's been 2 weeks without a smoke, and i'm feeling pretty good inside. 

I've been really tired lately, and sleeping alot over spring break, but i feel good when i wake up. it's a really good feeling. i even told jordan to stick out our deal untill we leave for summer break, because i'm feeling good not smoking, and my wallet is feeling happy too!

i may not be as long time of a smoker as some of the people here, but stopping straight up after 5 years makes me feel pretty strong in myself. 

thanks for reading :) and good luck to all of you!

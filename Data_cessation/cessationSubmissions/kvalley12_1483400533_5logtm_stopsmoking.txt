Starting a new job tomorrow !

Tomorrow will be day 5 quit smoking and also I will be training for a new job. It's a pretty up beat fast paced job and I know I'm going to have to pay attention to small detail during training these next couple of days. The problem is I've been in such a fog the past couple of days and water isn't helping much. I've been sleeping like crap lately so I plan on trying to get to bed early tonight maybe that will help ! Any suggestions really need help for this fog !

Intense cravings 5 - 6 weeks in

I haven't smoked since January 31, and I've been doing well with a gradually waning urge to smoke since my quit day.

Except...  These past few days I have had cravings that are just as bad as the first few days quitting, even worse.  I feel like I'm going to burst into tears or something.  I thought I was over the worst, but I've been dying to smoke since about three days ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  Worse than day 1, 2, 3. etc.  Just ranting, and wondering if anyone else went through something similar.

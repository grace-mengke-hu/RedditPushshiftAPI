How did you over come the reward system?

I've always (for the last 7 years) used a cigarette as a reward when I'm cleaning. Yanno, do the dishes, do the laundry, have a smoke. Do the floors, do the bathrooms, have a smoke. I'm trying to quit, but cleaning is such a thing I dread (and it really needs to be done), how did you get over your own reward system?

I've relapsed yesterday, here's what I feel right now.

1) **Disappointment.** The least I got by smoking was relaxation, relief or joy. Instead i felt a disgusting smoke and an urge to keep going. It's like you're craving for a feeling that is no longer there. It really makes you feel like an idiot.

2)**Fear.**. I think it's as simple as arithmetics. It's like I've been pulled back many many days back into the abstinence period. I was confortable, now I'm not. 

Relapse if you will, but it's really not worth it. It won't even give you what you need (when did it anyways?).

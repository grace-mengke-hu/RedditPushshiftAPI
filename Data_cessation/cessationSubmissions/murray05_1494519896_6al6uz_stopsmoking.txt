Don't Glorify the Final Cigarette

My quit this time has been much easier to handle than previous tries.


I realized that this time, unlike others, I didn't specifically mark the occasion in my head when I was smoking that last one. My decision to quit happened after I smoked it, and I think for some reason that has helped me dwell on it less. Any thoughts?

Not starting again after the bet is won.

I've recently went abroad for about 4 months, doing internship/developmental work.
Shortly before this I went snowboarding with some friends, got drunk and made a bet to quit smoking. It's like the third time I did this, only now we were quite drunk and it turned out to be a [slapbet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZDDpXOFds8) for 10 slaps.

The outlines were: don't smoke any tobacco from first of March till 15th of July.

It came quite easy. I got out of my old habits, nobody around me was smoking and after 3 weeks I felt like I was completely finished.

After 3 months I did some travelling, away from my small village, partied, went to a stripclub - where I was offered a cigarette by a quite convincing young lady - and partied a whole lot more. I felt tempted to smoke, but saying no came quite easily.

Now I'm home and it's quite difficult. People asking me to smoke and I join them, because I prefer chilling in the smoking room where the music isn't so load. Luckily my best friend had to quit smoking, which isn't making it as hard as it could be. I feel like I can maintain it until 15th of July easily. I'm only worried about after.

I don't really want to quit smoking. I long to smoke very dearly. I love smoking. It made me quite productive. Now when I'm finishing my thesis, I can't take a smoking break. Those used to help me so much. A walk around isn't the same.

Anybody have any advice?

No more addiction... no more sleep

Alright guys. So I gave up my nicotine addiction cold turkey last week. Withdrawals were rough especially in the beginning, but not nearly as bad as my lack of sleep due the need for a cigarette. I was a pretty heavy smoker- about a pack a day for a year and a half. Since I quit, I have gotten on average 2 hours of sleep this whole week and quite frankly I'm tired of it. I've tried dosing up on melatonin, taking baths before bed, reading something boring, drinking tea, counting sheep, and just lying in the dark. Nothing works. Last night I took a few shots of rum about got around 5 hours of sleep because it mostly killed my anxiety about falling asleep. I tried to take naps several times today but I couldn't manage to fall asleep. Tonight I am drinking a beer.

I know people say do not drink before bed as it could make your sleep have less quality and could cause alcoholism but what else can I do without smoking another cigarette? I am a walking zombie and I'm extremely frustrated. 

I don't think this could lead to alcoholism because once I get a good nights rest then I won't have anxiety anymore (aka, won't need to drink).

What do you do to help you fall asleep when you are having insomnia? Also, are there any ex smokers in here?

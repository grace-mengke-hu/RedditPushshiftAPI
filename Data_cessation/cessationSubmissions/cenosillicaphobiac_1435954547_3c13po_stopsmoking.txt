Day 9, feels fine!

Day nine and strong like a motherfucker.  It's been meh for the past couple of days, I quit taking Chantix on Monday or Tuesday, and got a little bit of Chantix withdrawal, but manageable.

I've gotten into a steady groove at work, I only get breaks every couple of hours so if I just keep myself occupied during those times, the rest takes care of itself.

Today has been a series of triggers.  It's hot as hell, so naturally I cracked a couple of beers for the mowing of the lawn, and no yard work should ever be done without the benefit of a little herb, so heat, beer, outside, weed, yardwork, it's like a perfect storm.  Embraced that craving and enjoyed it for what it was, the dying throes of my nicotine monster throwing its desperate last weapons into the fray.  If that's the best it can do I'm golden.

Cheers y'all, have a happy, safe, smoke free holiday for those in the US, the rest of you enjoy your weekend!

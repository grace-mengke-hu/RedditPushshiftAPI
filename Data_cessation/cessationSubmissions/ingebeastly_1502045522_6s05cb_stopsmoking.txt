One of the best things I've experienced since I stopped.

I started a new job recently and made it a point to stop smoking right before (literally the Saturday before) I started and it's been really refreshing to finally have a sizeable group of people (my co-workers) who don't think of me as a smoker.

Also, my stamina's gotten a lot better, I can actually walk decent distances without being completely out of breath!

How to avoid the temptation to bum cigarettes in a social situation?

I used to smoke every day but I was never a heavy or pack a day smoker and eventually moved to only smoking in social gatherings when other people would smoke while drinking. They would either offer me one or id ask to bum one.

Now that I've quit I find it hard to say 'no' to people who are smoking around me. I don't crave it anymore on a daily basis but something about alcohol makes me crave cigarettes wherever I am... They're the perfect match. I *definitley* don't want to quit drinking just to quit smoking. 

Any advice?

Haven't posted since 5 days in, now over 8 weeks and wanted to say thank you.

I posted after 5 days some whiney comment about being moody and agitated. I wanted to quit quitting at that point but you guys showed me that it'll pass and that I should stop looking for excuses. I just wanted to say thank you for that and for all of the bits and pieces I've picked up from lurking here ever since.

There's still a long road to go but I feel better equipped to handle it now and ready to keep going.

Many thanks. You guys rule.

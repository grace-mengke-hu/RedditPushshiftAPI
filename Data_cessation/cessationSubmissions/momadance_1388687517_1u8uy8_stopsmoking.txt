3rd times the charm?

Been a smoker since I was about 16.  Now I'm 30 and today is my 3rd attempt at qutting ever.  I'm feeling positive and like I can do this for the first time.  Hoping to stay feeling as strong as I am now.  Accepting any tips that people might have.  I'm quitting cold turkey because everyone I know who has used gum or substitutes are just as additcted to them as they were to smoking.

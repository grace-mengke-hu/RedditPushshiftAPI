Want to say how proud I am of everyone who has quit

I counted myself in all those people till tonight.  After 82 days, I screwed up and smoked.  It was a particularly bad day, found out I'm getting sued in small claims, lost my job, diagnosed with bladder cancer(early diagnosis luckily) and decided I wanted to postpone my wedding.  That's too much to get into.  

I had quit using chantix and done well.  Pretty much did it all by myself.  Family and friends are all non smokers and haven't been particularly supportive.  Not sure why.  But anyways.

Planning to quit again.  Just dont want to hit the reset button on my app.  Feel stupid ashamed and like 2 1/2 months is down the drain.  

Thanks for listening.  And never forget how easy it is to slip.  Stay strong!

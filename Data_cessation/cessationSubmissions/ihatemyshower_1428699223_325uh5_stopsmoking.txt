Miserable. Today I want to start again.

Using a throwaway.  I stopped Jan. 1.  Slipped after 60ish days.  Back on the wagon for 29 days now.  I know:  I will still have the same problems PLUS I'll be a smoker if I start again.  But I am building up to a big case of the fuck-its.  I lost a dear friend a couple of weeks ago and now I've found out that I'm going to need another invasive surgery for a chronic medical problem- one that was supposed to IMPROVE without nicotine.  Instead its flared up, painful, stressful and in general fucking my life up.  Looking at probably 6 weeks of unpleasant recovery time.  I am so tempted to go to the store right now.  Started to call the state quit helpline but they want you to enter your phone number and it just creeped me out- too Big Brother-y.

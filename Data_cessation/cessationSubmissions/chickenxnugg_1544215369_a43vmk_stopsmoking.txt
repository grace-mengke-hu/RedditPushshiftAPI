Day 2.

So I havent had a cigarette since maybe 10am yesterday. I know there are probably a couple different schools of thought on this but I bought one of those disposable ecigs to use to help me wean down my nicotine intake without cutting it off completely. I am making a concerted effort to use it as an aid and not a replacement. Has anyone else done it this way and succeeded?

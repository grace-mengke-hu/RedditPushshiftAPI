How do I get a girl I like to quit smoking?

I started recently talking again to a girl I've known for about 2 years. She started smoking cigarettes 6 months ago because her roommates &amp; friends at university did it and she wanted to fit in. I really like her a lot and I know the damage smoking can have on someone (I've never smoked before and do not like the habit personally) in the long run so I told her she should quit while she is still young (she's only 18, I'm 21) so her lungs can still heal from the damage. She said if I start dating her, she will quit for me (we both really like each-other and are considering dating anyways). I told her to slowly reduce the amount of cigarettes she smokes, she only smoked 2 yesterday and I think she will smoke 2 again today. I don't know if this is enough though, I didn't want her to quit cold turkey because of withdrawal effects. How can I help her quit? She seems really positive to the idea and seems like she wants to quit too because she knows it's not good for her. Please help me.

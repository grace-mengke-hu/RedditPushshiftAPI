Day 1

Day 1 again.. like so many other days. But this time i am going to write notes to myself and you guys as well, hoping it helps. 

I went home for the long weekend and didnt smoke worrying family will find out. Where I am now, my usual habit is just smoking in my room [ bud or cigs ] . I  couldnt find bud this time so i just slept. I had things to do but i feel like i need it when im alone. I have replaced it with everything i use to be able to do alone. But here i am, my dealer was good again and i drove there got some and rolled one up. I hate myself for it right after i smoke. If i ever knew someone like myself i would judge them based on their habits of smoking. But here it goes again where i try to quit - This means just flushing the bud/cigs down the drain. This time it means wasting $45 + $10.  I do this every other night and i can barely remember the time i didnt get tired of smoking and throwing it out at least once a week. the craving just always kicks and i hate myself right after i feed it.

I would love any help I can get.

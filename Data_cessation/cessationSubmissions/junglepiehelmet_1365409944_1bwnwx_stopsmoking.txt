Any ideas of substitutions for after meal or morning coffee?

Okay, I have tried to quit several times and have had set backs each time. I've used the patch, gum, and even tried cold turkey. Each time I get a couple days, or maybe a week or two and cave. I find that the times I want to smoke the most is right after a meal or with coffee in the morning, or with coffee any time really. I know I am not alone with this so have any of you successful people found an alternative to help kill the craving? I really want to try again but don't want to fail this time.

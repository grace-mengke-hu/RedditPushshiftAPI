Dreams, dreams &amp; dreams.

It's been 3 days 16 hrs since I smoked my last cigarette and I've had a bunch of dreams whenever I am sleeping, doesn't matter day or night. Every dream is vivid and sometimes wild. I can remember every dream. I've been having dreams since the 2nd day. Today I had lunch and was taking an afternoon nap as I had nothing to do. I was well asleep when my roommate lights a cigarette from the other corner of the room. Even though I was sleeping I could still smell the cigarette but I couldn't make sense of it. I had a dream at that exact moment, it was a short dream. I dreamt of smoking a cigarette. In my dream I was aware that I've left cigarette and had no craving for smoking but my friend hands it to me to hold it for him for a minute and in that minute I took a puff. I don't remember exactly how many puffs I took maybe 2 or 3 puffs max. In my dream I could feel the guilt and embarrassment of smoking it because I said to my friend that I am leaving cigarettes once and for all. I am not taking even one puff ever. Suddenly, I wake up and see that I was actually sleeping and I had this dream because my friend was smoking cigarette from other side of the room and realize that maybe the smell triggered the dream. I am so grateful that it was just a dream.

Nicorette quickmist taste?

I recently picked up a nicorette quick mist in cool berry flavour, I am cutting down on smoking, and wanted something as an alternative to my vape for situations in which I can't use it and don't want to go outside (winter is approaching). Anyway, one spray of that spray has me gagging and spitting, it's absolutely horrible, anyone else use it, is it something you can just get used to?

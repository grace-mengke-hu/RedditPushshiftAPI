DAY ONE

Actually I guess I'm technically at Day 2 now...been slightly over 24hrs since my last smoke. I've quit for years at a time and picked up the habit again in 2012. Kind of having a shit day right now, forgot how hard this is...but looking forward to feeling good about being smoke free. I can remember that I didn't always feel like smoking but right now...all I feel like doing is smoking. My car reeks of smoke and I'm at work and I'm totally stressed about the drive home. Ugh anyways just wanted to say Hi to all of you who are suffering with me!! It does get better..........

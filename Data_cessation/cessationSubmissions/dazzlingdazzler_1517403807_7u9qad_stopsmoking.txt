In 14 hours I will be 6 months cigarette free!

Half a freakin’ year and I FEEL AMAZING. I am so proud of myself! I never thought I would make it this far, but here I am! :) proud, healthy and full of strong willpower. I will NEVER pick up another smoke. The urges still come every now and then, but I learned I am stronger than them and shut them down faster than EVER. Here’s to 6 more months and years! YOU CAN DO IT TOO!!!

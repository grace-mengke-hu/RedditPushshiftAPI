I slept through the entire night!!!

I'd like to share :) it's been 4 days since I had my last cigarette. The edge that got me to really quit was when I was in the car, I had just gotten home from work. When I had a cigarette that morning I said it was my last, I downloaded and app that counted the hours for me and cigs missed etc.

 Im in the car craving a cig really bad, I think I could just smoke this LAST one before I go up to my apartment, I always say that - it's never the last one. I sit in the car for 10 minutes with my husband, in silence. Not really thinking about the cig, not really not thinking about the cig. When the thinking mellows I get out of the car without arguing with myself about it. I just do it, hubby follows and smiles.

 For the first 3 days I have horrible fucked up nightmares, one was of shadows banging drums in my room and me paralyzed in bed and more crazy shit. Today, 4 days later, For the first time in as long as I can remember I slept through the entire night! The entire night yo! I always wake up like 2-4 times every night to pee, at least 1 time I'll wake just cause ??? I closed my eyes last night and when I woke it was morning. So incredible, so thankful, it's only one night but I had to share. Good luck to all ya trying to quit! There are sunny gifts ahead!!

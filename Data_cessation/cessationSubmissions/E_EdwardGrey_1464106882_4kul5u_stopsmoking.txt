Badge me the F up, let's do this.

I just finished reading "The Book" and in a little while, I'll be smoking my last cigarette.  I started smoking when I was 13 (now 32) and have tried to quit multiple times, but this time something is different.  While I completely agree that there's nothing "magic" within the book, I feel that it enabled me to see smoking as a whole in a much clearer light.  While I believe we'd all agree that there isn't anything to actually gain from smoking, I still felt that I really enjoyed it.  I ran a scenario through my mind where I was craving a smoke quite badly and the "little monster" shows up and I ,of course, get that empty feeling in the pit of my stomach and I continue smoking cigarettes that theoretically had no nicotine and therefore did nothing to reduce the craving.  I don't imagine it would take any of us all that long to abandon ship so I don't think I can use enjoyment as a reason to smoke anymore.  I'm addicted to nicotine, it's that simple, and that's not a fight I dread participating in.  Compound that with the realization that I only smoke cigarettes so I won't want to smoke cigarettes and that's enough motivation for any logical, intelligent person to at least fight like hell to leave them behind.  Anyway, thanks first to Allen Carr for the simple yet effective insight, and secondly to this sub.  I've lurked you guys for a while and you've helped me whether you know it or not.  Come on /r/stopsmoking, we got this!!!

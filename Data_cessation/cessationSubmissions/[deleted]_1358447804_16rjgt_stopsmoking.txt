Smoker for about 6 years now. Finally got my prescription for Chantix. Kind of scared. What was your experience w. Chantix. (All stories, successful or not, are welcome.)

So basically, I finally called in my medical director to come in for the monthly audit for my clinic and asked about Chantix. (I own a skin clinic for which I am setting a bad example for by smoking.) I had a long talk with her and she told me that as soon as I feel that something is terribly wrong, to stop completely. I know a couple of friends who are/were on Chantix and one of them had really awesome results with it and has been smoke free for about 4 months now. I am not going to lie, I am some what scared because I have always relied on cigarettes for almost every emotion that I felt and me being somewhat high strung on emotions am scared of how Chantix might mess with them. (As it states that it might cause depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.) Need some help motivation wise and also some stories with Chantix working/not working for you would help greatly. Thanks in advance! :-)

7 days in am I doing it right?

I have a pretty stressful profession and tried quitting before but it didn't work due to the stress. Tried patches at that time. Still got heavy cravings.

I decided to wait until I got knee surgery an have vacation to quit again. No one smokes at my parents' house.

I have been getting serious cravings about 3-4 times a day for about 15-20 minutes each. I have been dealing with it by smoking a nicotine free hookah pen and bought some honeywell clove cigarettes. 

I smoked a few of them yesterday because I was on the phone a lot and had friends over who smoke. But I haven't smoked a real cigarette in a week.

Am I doing this right? Whenever I get a small craving I puff the hookah pen a few times and 75% of the time it goes away. When I get a heavy craving I'll smoke a clove. (Like when I'm out with friends) They taste like soap and smell horrible. Today I smoked one after breakfast and couldn't finish it because it was unbearably disgusting. 

Do you guys think this is a good approach for now? I'm planning on doing this for about a month and then dropping them cold turkey. Figuring by then my brain will have a long enough break from nicotine and it will be less scary for me to let go.

One year today!

This past year was pretty tough starting out, but I made it!  I can honestly say that I do not have cravings any more, and I go days without even thinking about it. If youâ€™re thinking about quitting, do it! I lurked in this sub a lot when I first quit and got so much motivation from others. Thank you all for sharing your experiences and helping me beat this habit!

The goal is not to smoke while drinking. I can do it!

Over the years, I've managed to cut my smoking to only when I drink.  I no longer get any cravings except when I am drinking surrounded by smokers.  The social ineptitude to relate to others doesn't help and I use smoking as a way to socialize with other.
No more of that shit.  I want to be a proud non smoker enjoying my drunkness.  No more shittier hangovers because of all the nasty chemical residues in my body.  No more caughing due to smoking.  No more nicotine taste lingering in my mouth.  I am done!

My subconscious has finally quit smoking too

I quit smoking on the 30th March 2016. I had many smoking dreams after the initial quit, either desiring a cigarette so bad or giving into the temptation and waking up full of anger and shame, only to realise it was a dream.

Last night I had a dream where I was walking with a bunch of old friends, one of them had a pouch of tobacco that he handed to me, like "here you can have this" 
My reaction in the dream wasn't one of excitement or temptation, but of mild disinterest. I was like "why do I want this? I got no use for tobacco man, here (other friend) you might as well have it instead."

I didn't think anything of it at the time but when I woke up I realised that perhaps the deeper parts of myself are finally non-smoker too!

Anyone else have any similar experiences? Dreams are fascinating and I believe they are as much a part of reality as every day life, so this dream scenario made me feel pretty good.

Keep it up people, you got this!

A word of advice, appreciate your new lungs!

Here is a piece of advice that helped me to quit three years ago.  Take advantage of your new lung capacity.  Take on new aerobic excercise, sing with a singing group, or do anything that you really enjoy that requires good lung function.  When you create a new habit that requires your lungs to work well, you will have another trick up your sleeve when a craving hits.  You will not want to smoke a cigarette, because it will take away from your ability to do that new thing that you love!

Small milestone, but I'm now officially two days in!

These last two days have been living hell, and I'm really starting to notice the techniques my brain is using to get me to light up again. It seems like I'm reliving a lot of past trauma through memories when some of the cravings start and it feels like the worst thing ever, and if it's not that, I get that little voice in my head that wants to reward me for doing so well by having a cigarette \(go figure\). Anyway, not going to make a long post going on about it, just want to use this community to my advantage since I don't really mention it much irl to anyone, think that actually is helpful with my quitting.

Hope you guys are doing well also and wish you all the best, thanks for taking a few to celebrate with me!

In need of some motivation to quit for good

I was a rather heavy smoker for 8 years in my teens/20s (I’m 34 now) but I read Allen Carr’s book, and was a happy nonsmoker for over 2 years.

Then I got into a bad relationship, and during the final months leading up to the inevitable breakup, I was so depressed and unhappy that I started smoking again. 

That was almost 2 years ago, and I’m back to being a pack-a-day smoker now. Over the past two months, I’ve tried re-reading the book, and even listened to the audiobook but I haven’t been able to make it past 2 days before lighting up again. 

I keep trying, every day, but I’m getting discouraged . I know I’m not a confirmed smoker and that I have the ability to stop and live my healthiest and best life again, but I’m just having so much trouble. 

Any kind words or advice would be much appreciated as I try to quit smoking once and for all.

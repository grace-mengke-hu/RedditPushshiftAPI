Day 3 - weird dreams

I rarely dream and some times when I dream, I just get thoughts or feelings. In my dream, I had a feeling that I relapsed and I woke up still thinking of it. There was no way because my body would of felt sick. I don't have cravings but it seems like I still have this smoker's mentality that I have to remind myself that I have quit. Last night, I went to a get together and had a couple of beers. I knew someone there would give me a cigarette if I asked. When I was on my first beer, I thought a smoke would go good with it but immediately disregarded the thought and that was it. I woke up slightly being able to smell the tar and vape flavor in my lungs.

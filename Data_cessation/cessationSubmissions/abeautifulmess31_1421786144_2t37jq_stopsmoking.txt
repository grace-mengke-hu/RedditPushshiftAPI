Day 20... I like getting to know non-smoker me.

I can't believe it's been 20 days! According to my app, I have not smoked almost 300 cigarettes... crazy! To all those people out there just getting started, it's hard. I smoked for 11 years. I cried every day for 2 weeks over nothing. I was cranky and mean and unreasonable. But I feel better today. I can breath more deeply, I don't stink, I don't feel the inner guilt I had following me around anymore from knowing that I was doing nothing but hurting myself. In fact, I feel more like myself and in control than I have in a long, long time. I'm liking getting to know non-smoker me. :)

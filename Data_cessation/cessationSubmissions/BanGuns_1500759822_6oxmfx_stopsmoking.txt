Ok trying for real now.

Been a 2 pack a day smoker for about 5 years. I have been driving shitty cars for the past 5 years as well only because with my habit I couldnt really afford a car payment. Fuck that Im done. I havent bought a pack since last sunday just been bumming a couple here and there. No more I need to get serious. Im disgusted that for years now smoking has been my number one priority. Feels pathetic, and Im done being a slave to smoking.

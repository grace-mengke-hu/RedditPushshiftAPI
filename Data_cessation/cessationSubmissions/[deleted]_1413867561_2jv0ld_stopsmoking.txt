Im 14 and this is ridiculous

Hello, ðŸ˜Š. I'm 14 years old and I first tried cigarettes when I was 10. My cousins thought it was funny to smoke pot in front if us and then give us cigarettes. Wanting to seem mature and cool to my cousins I would smoke those cigarettes down to the filter even though my eyes watered and my lungs were on fire. This led to me being able to actually enjoy a smoke at a very young age and I grew used to the sensation. Smoking was just a way to relax after a long day, everyone did it. Except recently people have informed me that I smell like smoke and have yellow teeth. I also have terrible acne issues and I've been told this is most likely a major contributor. I've tried to quit before and I had these "back contractions" I might call them. It was like a 10 second clenching of all my back muscles and sweating profusely. Miserable. But I realize I'm only 14 and my ciggarette habit is unusual and unhealthy so today's the day I start a healthier future :).

Newbies....here is some advice for you!

What's up peeps? Hope everyone is doing great this fine morning.

As I passed 6 months mark in my final attempt to quit, I thought I would give some words of encouragement. To those of you who are new, on your day 1 or 5 (in my opinion, worst day from them all), I want to tell you to just stick with it. I know it's hard, but it does get easier as time passes. Just imagine the life without needing to suck on these things, the stinky smell, the constant feeling of being tired, huffing and puffing, not being able to be active without feeling like you will pass out. All these things will be gone soon! I still think sometimes how awesome it is not to be a smoker anymore. It comes to me usually when I am stopped at the red light and I see someone smoking in their car. I did that too. Now my car is clean and smells nice. I don't have ashes on the back seat! It really feels awesome!!! I feel like a million bucks. It is sooooo nice to go out, have a drink and a nice dinner, and not have to think about these things. 

Keep at it guys. You got this! It's totally worth it!

Final Cigarette

I'm 19 and have been smoking since I was 14 years old. I was just a kid when I started smoking, I just wanted to be "cool". Five years later, I regret ever picking up that first cigarette. Smoking has caused me a lot of pain, but also helped me through some tough times (But not really. I've learned better now.) Even worse, I'm responsible for "helping" some of my friends start smoking. Even though none of them identify as "true" smokers, but only as "casual" smokers, I still feel responsible for exposing them to it. 

To that end, I just finished Allen Carr's Easy Way. Despite the bit of heart pounding nervousness of my life truly changing this time, after trying to quit numerous times over the last couple of years, I really feel like this might be the last time I "quit". I hope that this time I can show my friends that it's just as easy to quit as it was to get started. I know that they're going to do their own thing, be their own people, smoke if they want to, but I hope that they might see that it's at least possible.

So here I go. I'm going to creep out onto the back porch, hopefully not going to wake my Mother up, and inhale the filth one last time so that I can remember how bad it makes me feel and how bad it makes me smell. I am no longer a smoker.

Quit smoking 6 days ago.

Hey all,
I was a 5 year smoker and set a quit date of 1/1/2014. I know it was kind of a bad date to quit because many new years resolutions fail, but I set this date three months prior and eased my self down each month. On 1/1 I went cold turkey. I have been reading the quit stories on here and they help a lot I just have a few questions. 


- It is day 6 and I feel like something is stuck in my throat. has anyone else had this?(I have looked online and I see a lot about chest tightness not throat.)

-As of right now I do not notice many side effects except a little on edge and the weird throat feeling. Can I expect side effects to increase or am I in the clear if I have not had them yet?

-One of the hardest test I will have is going to a bar and drinking. I know alcohol is going to increase my craving for a cig. Is there anything you all have done in a social situation to fight the urge.

Thanks for reading and for any suggestions you have.

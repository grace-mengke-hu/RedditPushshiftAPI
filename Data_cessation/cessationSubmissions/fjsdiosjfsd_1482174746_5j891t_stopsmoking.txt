2 and a half months!

Forgot about my 2-month mark so I thought I'd post now. I like to come back here to read some posts and let everyone know I'm still going strong! (I was a pack-a-day smoker for a little over six years.)

I still get cravings. Some of them are pretty bad. Part of what's been helpful in getting through them is that I know they'll pass. I **love** waking up in the morning and not thinking immediately of smoking a cigarette. I (and my partner) also love not having gross breath in the morning because I smoked right before bed. All that goes out the window if I have a cigarette.

I still have the worry that one of these days I'm going to think "one won't hurt" and be smoking a pack a day again, but it hasn't happened yet. People say this all the time on here and it was very helpful to me, but take your quit one day at a time. I can say with confidence that I'm not going to have a cigarette today. And I'll say the same thing with confidence tomorrow. Thinking "o no will I fail at quitting and be smoking again in 5 years?!?!?" is daunting and scary, but dealing with the rest of today is a lot less so.

Wishing the best to everyone on this sub. You can do it!

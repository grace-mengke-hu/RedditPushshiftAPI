Just threw had my last smoke an hour ago ! Starting today i will quit smoking with you guys too !

Hi im new here .I made this account just for my self improvement , i think its high time i quit smoking , for me i have only started it 4 years ago but i quickly turned into a chain smoker i think it would be best to quit now since im going to start on a job soon and smoking is a big problem cause i know people dont like me around because of the smell . its not only that it has also been my biggest hole in my pocket , and my health been on a downward spiral ever since i started im know im getting physically weaker and weaker but that craving to have just one more is just too much to handle i am restless through out the day because of it ,i do my work just fine but i cannot focus unless i get a smoke . But this time i am determined to quit . So anyways Hello

How many times do I have to learn the same lesson?

I'm 33, started smoking when I was 15, and I've been quitting and starting since I was 21. Longest I've gone has been about a year and a half. I quit in October, but started up again a few weeks ago. I'm also asthmatic, and an avid gym-goer, so as you could imagine, smoking greatly interferes with my life. Just last night, I woke up coughing twice, and had to take my inhaler. I have all the motivation I need, just can't seem to get it through my dumb head and make it stick. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

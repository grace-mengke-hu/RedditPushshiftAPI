I thought the worst was over...

Okay so 11 days in and the last couple of days have not been fun. Have had pretty tough cravings, I'm not giving in but it's hard to resist. It's hard to not have something to fall back on... I know smoking doesn't solve anything, yet it feels like I'm missing some kind of support system. Each time I get stressed about something and I need a break, I just feel like I'm all on my own. I know I have people around me to help me and I also know that cigarettes don't help with any of my problems, they do the opposite... I'm still going crazy. And I'm at a point where I feel, "well I did it, I quit, see, I CAN do it if I want to, so I can start again now and quit later when it's time"... I know it's just a stupid excuse but I honestly don't know how to do to stop it. I feel like I have been good for a freaking eternity so I can reward myself and let loose and just smoke again. HELP ME, need to get this thought out of my head!!!

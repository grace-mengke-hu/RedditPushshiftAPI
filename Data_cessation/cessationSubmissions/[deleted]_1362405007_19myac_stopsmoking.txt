Day 1 -Here's hoping

Hi Everyone!  It's day 1 for me.  Threw out my pack, left my debit card and all my cash at home so I don't go out at lunch and buy a new one.  

Any tips for how to make it through the first few days?  I've tried it before, and my willpower is apparently lacking.  I need to quit, i've started having heart issues, I'm sick of feeling like shit every morning, and I want to get this addiction out of my life!

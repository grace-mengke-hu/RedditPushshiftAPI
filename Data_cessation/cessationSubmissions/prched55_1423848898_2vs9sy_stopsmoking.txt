Quit smoking 10 days ago

So, I quit smoking 10 days ago (ok, not actually smoking, it was vaping. but I'm still quitting all nicotine) and the cravings are worse these past couple of days than they were near the beginning.  Is this a normal thing and will it go away?  I always thought cravings are the worst at like the 3 day mark.

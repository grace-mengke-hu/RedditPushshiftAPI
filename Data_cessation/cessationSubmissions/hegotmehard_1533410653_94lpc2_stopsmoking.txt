Need some advice

Hello this is my first time posting here, English is not my native language sorry in advance for any mistakes.
I need help quit smoking. I started when I was 18 years old, fist it was a cigarette a day but now 9 years later am smoking a pack a day and I don't  know how to stop this habit. Two days ago was my first attempt to stop but the headache was too much. I gave up 30 min ago. I smoked one. Now I feel dizzy and depressed. Feel like it is going to be impossible to quit.
How can I do this? Is there like a program I can follow or something I can do to make it easier like smoking less everyday till i stop completely? Even seeing people smoking in the street makes my cravings 1000 time worse
Thank you in advance

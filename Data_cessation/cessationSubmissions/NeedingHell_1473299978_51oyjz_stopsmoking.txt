I just made a terrible mistake.

So I'm 22 years old. Never had a cigarette before today. I don't know why I bought the pack or why I smoked. I thought it would help take stress away. 

After reading here I can see that that will not happen. But I can't tell myself to stop for some reason. Please help convince me that this is a horrible choice.

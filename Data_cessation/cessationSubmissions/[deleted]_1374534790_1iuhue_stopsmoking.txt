2 weeks... longest I've gone with a cigarette in 3+ years!

The past few days I've realized that smoking hasn't really crossed my mind with the exception of a few minor times during the day.  It's amazing, 2 weeks ago when I woke up or after I ate, my first thought would "I need a smoke" but now that doesn't even enter my thoughts as a viable option!

I feel like I'm over a hump and this is going to stick... I wanted to thank everyone here.  The first week especially was really rough but reading posts here and the people who took time to respond to an earlier post I posted have really helped me stay strong!

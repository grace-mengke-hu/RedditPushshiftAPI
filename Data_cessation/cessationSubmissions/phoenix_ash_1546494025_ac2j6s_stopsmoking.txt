Do you guys use patches during triggering times?

I've been without Nicotine for my longest time yet, 9 week which is still fresh. I am going through a very stressful major life change, which really is only going to compound over the coming days and weeks. I have not been able to sleep with the idea of buying a pack of cigs and a vape is driving me insane.

Do people use patches to get over triggering times? Does that work or is that a slippery slope?

Ran into some millennials while vaping and this is what happened.

So I am about 40, and have been smoking for about 20 years. Or at least I have been. About 3 months ago I was walking down the street with a ciggy in hand and passed a couple of girls that were smoking one of these box vapor mods. I then "not purposely" blew smoke as I passed them. The response I got was "gag, cough, people still smoke!?" immediately I felt a bit shamed because i know the numbers of smokers are going down and quite frankly Tobacco is and has been cutting out a lot of my life. 

So, in mid stride I decided to stop and turn back and ask them what they are smoking? Most people think weed . But they were vaping flavored non nicotine "juice". I asked what kind. One was Miss Tea and the other was called The Muffin man. I was allowed to taste the two, because they were really all about me or anyone not smoking. I liked the flavors, the tasted exactly like their names. And I do enjoy a good tea. These were introduction flavors for me as now I vape more of a menthol with small nicotine but brought that down to zero. 

Has anyone else had any success with vaping to quit?

Thoughts about Chantix?

I'm 28 and I've smoked for nearly a decade. I was prescribed Chantix and have been taking it for 3-4 weeks. It took me a while to get into the habit of remembering to take it, but now that I'm well into the prescription I'm starting to feel the side effects. They're not impossible to deal with, though. Right now my side effects are comprised mostly of feeling vaguely foggy, easily angered or moody, some on and off nausea, and a combination of being stoned/hungover. The worst for me in particular is the social aspect, or lack thereof, rather. I've found myself less talkative, less interested in literally anything anyone has to say, and I've been avoiding social situations at work and when going out. I can still get myself to socialize with friends but handling small talk with acquaintances is monumentally more difficult than it ever has been, and I'm usually more than happy to engage in conversation with people. 

If anyone who has used Chantix has experienced similar side effects, please let me know your thoughts on how you coped. I'm still in it to win it!

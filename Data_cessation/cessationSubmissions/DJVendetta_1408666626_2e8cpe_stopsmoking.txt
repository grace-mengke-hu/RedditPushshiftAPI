F*ck it, let's do this!

I've been a ~5 a day smoker for around a year now, since I was DJing at a festival last year and went through a few 20-packs as I 'let myself go and enjoyed myself for once', alas I ended up smoking when I got home too. I thought it was great to go outside in the sun and have a smoke and then I started buying packs now and again. I wasn't smoking every day until around 6 months in and it took me a while to actually notice that I was wanting cigarettes. 

I've previously smoked cannabis daily for long periods but for some reason never touched cigs or rolls. It has been niggling at me for a few months now and it got to the point where it was making me heave and I couldn't finish a cig in one go, though I was always good in the sense that most of the time I would smoke half and smoke the other half later on. 

Last weekend I was stranded at a friends house with no money and just decided to not smoke. I've gone 5 days now without any strong urges, though I'm not sure what an urge is? Maybe I have a lot of self control but I haven't wanted a cigarette enough to go and buy some or ask somebody for one. Maybe I'll want one when I'm out tomorrow and end up smoking a few but I think I have the willpower to not smoke daily anymore - I'm not sure, I'll see how it goes.

I'm happy to be joining you all on this journey :)

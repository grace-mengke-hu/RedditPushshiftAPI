Never thought I'd made it this far... but I did, and you guys can too!

Its been almost half a year since I quit, before this my longest quit attempts were only weeks at a time, maybe a month or two if I was lucky. I probably quit and failed over 30 or 40 times. The fact that I made it to half a year is like pure ecstasy to me. 

I owe it to this subreddit for making it this far, thank you guys for having my back, it means the word to me. For everybody who is in the early stages of quitting, stay strong you can do it!!! =D

I am stopping tomorrow but I feel half-hearted :/

I've made an impulsive decision that tomorrow's the day (again)! When I say impulsive, I mean about a week ago, so I have had time to plan.

I've got my patches at the ready and I've been going through Allen Carr's book this week, hopefully will finish it in the next couple of hours. I know he doesn't recommend NRT but that's my choice and his book is still a motivation.

But I'm struggling to get excited about tomorrow. I know I HAVE to stop - not because of anything horrific having happened, just because I've gone on like this for 10 years and there are no reasons to smoke. 

I so want to stop. Motivate me please!!!!!! :)

I should feel more positive in the morning.

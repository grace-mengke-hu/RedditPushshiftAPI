Quitting in a smoker's household?

Hey all! 

I'm a 29 year old smoker who's been at it for 10 years at a pack a day. I feel like absolute crap every morning, most likely from carbon monoxide poisoning. I usually get myself through the first half of the day with minor issues when attempting to quit. It's difficult because I moved back in with my parents a few months ago. My father smokes two packs a day in the house and it's almost impossible to resist when I get home from work. Anyone else experience a similar situation, and if so, how did you overcome that roadblock in your decision to quit? 

Thanks in advance,

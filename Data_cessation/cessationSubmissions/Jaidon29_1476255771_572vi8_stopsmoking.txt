Quick question about understanding vape nicotine mg

I've quit smoking cigarettes completely, and have been vaping for a while now, it's much healthier 
(Even though nothing would be optimal)
My question is these days it takes me a week to go through 1.6ml of e-juice 12mg nicotine
Is that very low in terms of nicotine p/day? 

(Only asking cause when I bought it the young guy behind the counter said it's a strong one)

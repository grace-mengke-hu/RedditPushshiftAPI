No bullshit this time.

Last time I quit I went 3 months and then a bachelor party (my own) to vegas just set my entire life into a downward spiral. Not to say I fucked up at anything major, I just went from not smoking at all to smoking again and from working out 4 days a week to not one time since. So I just recently quit my job which was really the only place I would smoke - I don't smoke ever at home because of how much fianc√© hates it. Now that I am not working, I have not smoked in 3 days and the workout regimen starts up again tomorrow. Wish me luck, the new chapter in life begins tomorrow!

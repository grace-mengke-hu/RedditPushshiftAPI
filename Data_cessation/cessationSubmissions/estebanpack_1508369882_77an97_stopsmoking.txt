How I quit this month

I thought up a way to quit using tobacco using the calendar as an aid and a tool to wean oneself off of nicotine. 

It’s very simple: the day of the month is the number of hours you go between uses (one cigarette, 15 minute pinch of dip).

It’s surprisingly easy to stick to if your wristwatch has an adjustable timer. Smoke a cigarette, start the hour timer. Wake up, set timer to 2 hours, smoke, start the alarm.

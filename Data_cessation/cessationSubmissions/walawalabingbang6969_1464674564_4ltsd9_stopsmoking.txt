Smoking dream

I'm about a week into the process but I had just 3 on Saturday night. That's all though...anyway I had a dream last night I smoked a cigarette. Somebody passed me a cigarette... In the dream, and I smoked the last half. I woke this morning feeling like I had smoked a bunch of cigarettes. Very weird. Just thought I'd share. I really want to quit because I want to live a long time and I hear that not smoking cigarettes is a good way to make that happen :-)

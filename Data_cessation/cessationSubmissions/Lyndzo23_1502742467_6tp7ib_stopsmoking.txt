Non-linear??? Help

So it's almost been 3 weeks. I was miserable and super emotional until around day 11. Then it cleared up for like a week and felt pretty good emotionally but still rundown. I guess I thought I was in the clear. But now at around day 19 my sleep is shit again and emotionally wrecked again out of nowhere. Can anyone relate to this or am I losing it?!

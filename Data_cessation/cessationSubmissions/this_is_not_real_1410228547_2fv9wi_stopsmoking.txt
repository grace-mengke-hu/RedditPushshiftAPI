I almost relapsed today...

I came home from work today to find my home was burglarized.  The sliding glass door in my backyard was shattered and I lost a ton of valuables.  I'm a major PC gamer, as is my girlfriend.  They stole 2 monitors, 2 razer keyboards, a wireless mouse, they took the HP all-in-one touchscreen computer my girlfriend plays games on at my house, 2 iPads and a Samsung tablet, and 2 televisions.  On top of that they stole jewelry, and irreplaceable sentimental items.  

I recently had to move into my parents house again when my old roommates moved out and to a different state.  The all-in-one was originally purchased for my father who uses a 15 year old dell (which of course wasn't stolen, yet it had the most value because of the information stored on it) but he decided he didn't want to learn "that Windows 8 garbage".  So I've been letting my girlfriend use it to play DOTA 2 since she doesn't have a computer yet.  I'm pretty sure I came home while they were still in the house because my sisters room was the only room that was half touched.  I had change and money in my room that was taken but they didn't take hers, and her TV was in the backyard so I'm assuming they left it behind when I got there.

This has never happened to me in the 26 years I've been alive.  I can't afford, nor can my parents, to replace any of the belongings, so hopefully insurance will provide enough to replace it all.  Thankfully these things were just material objects that can (aside from the sentimental items of deceased family members) be replaced. 

I almost smoked a cigarette.  I was amazed at how quickly that thought came and went though.  I use an e-cig but it just wasn't cutting it.  ANyway, I had to rant/vent/whatever.  Thanks for listening.  Glad to still be smoke free.

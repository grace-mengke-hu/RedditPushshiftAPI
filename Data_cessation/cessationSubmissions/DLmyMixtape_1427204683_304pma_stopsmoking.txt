It's a beautiful thing.

I can't remember my last cigarette. I feel free. I dreamed about smoking a cigarette last night, I distinctly remember this feeling of overwhelming disgust and guilt. Waking up sure was a relief. 

My flair informs me that it has been 20 days, but it seems like a lifetime ago I was a slave to the tobacco industry. Also I ran 15 miles last week, feelsgoodman.jpeg. Dare I say 20 this week?

2 years :)

I had quit smoking for eight months before this - easily, somehow, after 7 years of "friendship" - and then got sucked back in when my confidence got the better of me.  That then led to *three more years* of constant quitting - smoke for a week, stop for five days; smoke for three weeks, stop for two - repeat repeat repeat.  Total misery.  Three more years.  But now I have two - and had it not been for that slip, I wouldn't be as caring and appreciative for the quit I have now.  So if any of you have slipped - that's okay!  You were meant to so that the next quit will be more dear.  What helped me was seeing past the illusions - how cigarettes literally don't change stressful circumstances, how they don't give me my talents (my brain makes me a good writer, not fucking smokeeeeee!), and that it was never going to be like it was in college again - and I kept those and more in my back-pocket (and lots of gum and dark chocolate and fizzy waters at home) whenever a craving hit.  


And now I'm here.  And I'm happy.  And I hope everyone here has their magical quit ahead :)

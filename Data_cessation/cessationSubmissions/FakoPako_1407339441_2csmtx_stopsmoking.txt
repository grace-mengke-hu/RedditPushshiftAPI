Smoked since 17. Over 20 years...

What are the chances of my lungs rebuilding after smoking almost a pack for 20 years? Will my lungs ever go back to "normal" if I start doing cardio? I know liver can rebuild after being abused, it takes time though. Can lungs be rebuild?

Also, I would like to get checked out and make sure there is nothing funky in my lungs. I read somewhere that xray for lungs really won't show potential risks. What test should I ask  my doctor for?

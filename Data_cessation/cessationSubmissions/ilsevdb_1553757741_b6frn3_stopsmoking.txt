Shower thought about the seasons

So I heard before that the three month mark seems to be a hard time for people, and I was thinking why.

Could it be the change of seasons? 

We work to replace all the smoking memories with new healthy ones, and after two months we are doing a good job at that. Then the seasons change, and we are surprised with a new set of memories, making it a little harder again? 

I am not struggling or anything, but had a dream last night I was smoking outside without a coat on (spring is just starting here) and I quit in winter. So it feels like a connection! 

Anyone thoughts on this?

8 years of smoking, tried to quit few times and came back to it. i need to let it all out ...

Hey everyone,

I've been smoking for the past 8 years. recently i went on/off for couple of time - longest was about 2 weeks without any type of tobacco.

I don't know what it is that keeps dragging me back to smoking, its like a deep false feeling that relates to everything i do.

One of my weaknesses is smoking while drinking. iv'e managed not to smoke couple of times while doing it but i find myself craving for that cigarette while having a beer.

It's literally killing me inside when i smoke. i know its a bad habit, i want to get done with this for good.
I've even started working out to get passed that smoking desire but on the weekends i'm just going and buying those goddamn cigarettes cause i know im going to have a drink or something..

I don't know why i cant just take the pack and break it and throw it away...

I feel like in need support, yours i guess. the people who go through out this feeling.

It's night time - i had a cigarette as it was my last one.
I'm starting tomorrow with a different perspective. I hope i get it right this time.

Just had to get this off my chest.

Wish me luck !

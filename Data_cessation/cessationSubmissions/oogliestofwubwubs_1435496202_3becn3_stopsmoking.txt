Pseudo Smoking Hangover

So I have not smoked. As far as I'm aware, the only smoking dream I've had is a few days ago when I had a dream that I was smoking weed. Still haven't had a cigarette smoking dream.

Last night (day 40) I had such bad cravings. The only thing that I can attribute it to is that I was drinking diet soda (it was movie night! With popcorn!) and it triggered me somehow.

This morning I woke up and I felt like I had a smoking hangover - you know how you'd feel when you woke up after smoking way too much the night before.  Throat is a little sore, tonsils feel a little big, dehydrated.  

It is so weird.

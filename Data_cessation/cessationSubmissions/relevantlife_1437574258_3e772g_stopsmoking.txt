83 hours smoke free, but I barely slept last night. Insomnia is the worst symptom I've faced so far!

I feel like today I am a bitch not because I am not smoking, but because I did not sleep last night! I tossed and turned and even smoked a little weed, and still couldn't manage to fall asleep. 

How long does it typically take for the insomnia to pass?

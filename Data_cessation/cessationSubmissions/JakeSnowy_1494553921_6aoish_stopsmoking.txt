Wallet pain quitting method

Hey guys, I saw this subreddit and figured I'd share the method I used a few months ago to quit. I call it the "wallet pain" method.. For me at least one of the hardest parts was walking into a gas station and checking out without buying a pack. I'd often walk out with one, relapse, then get "last pack syndrome" all over again.. So I made some rules.

1. Buying a pack occasionally is ok while quitting as long as I take one cigarette out, stomp then throw away the rest of the pack before lighting my expensive new single cigarette..  (much easier to throw out right before you indulge)

2. If I bum a cigarette I have to pay $5 for it. People usually refuse the payment but when I tell them to take it because it has to hurt - they understand and do so!

3. It's not a relapse just the process of quitting when these happen... Just pay the price, feel the pain and move on. You'll only know which cigarette was your real last till you make it but always assume your current one is it.

4. The goal is 4 days, once you make it to 4 days you're not allowed to do 1 or 2 anymore.. If you somehow relapse start over. 4 day goal.

It took me about 3 weeks to make it to the 4 day goal and quit.. I'm not rich by any means and this got expensive quickly, but it was way more motivating than just thinking "don't do it!!". I don't even want to think too hard about how much it cost me but I'm sure by now I'm back to profit from not buying packs anymore. 

I'm sure it's not for everyone but I hope it helps some of you guys too :)

Best of luck! <3

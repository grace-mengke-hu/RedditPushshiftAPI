Gonna bend that bastard nicotine over...

Been a lurker for awhile and made an account to become a part of this subreddit. Decided last night that I no longer want to smoke. I got an electronic cigarette kit about two weeks ago and would use it at work. However, last night after smoking a cigarette at the bar, I had a really bad chest pain. Then and there, I said "Fuck it, i'm no longer going to be nicotine's bitch. I'm going to make nicotine my bitch from now on". I'm about 16 hours in and have not had a cigarette and got through the rush at work today(I manage a busy restaurant) without using my electronic cigarette nor bumming a cigarette off of a co-worker. After using the electronic cigarette, the smell and taste of real cigarettes begun to gross me out. I've been chewing gum and on straws constantly and taking super deep breaths when I get a craving.
Any advice and support on how to subside these cravings and staying quit would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks Reddit!

How long is the irritability going to last

I'm on day 4, and feeling much more irritable than I have over the past couple days. My patience is gone, the smallest thing is setting me off. I'm a full time single mom of 21 month old, I have to find a way to get over the irritability because I don't have another choice. And no, I can't send him to stay with his dad for a week or two until the worst is over. There is no option of me being able to take time to myself.
Please help

Uniquestring has died.

Uniquestring's daughter here; I was playing on my dad's phone tonight and checked out his reddit page. It looks like he was quite active on this sub and I wanted to let you all know to keep up the good work, because cigarettes killed my father. He wasn't feeling well for a while, and at the beginning of June he started accumulating fluid in his abdomen and after a liver biopsy, it was determined that he had cancer in his liver. After further investigation, cancer was also discovered in his intestines, and as you might have guessed, it all originated in his lungs. Watching my brilliant father waste away and die so quickly has been the hardest ordeal I have dealt with. We lost him July 2, at 6:55 PM; the day before my mother's birthday, and 25 days before his 61st birthday. Please, stay quit, if not for yourselves, for the sake of your loved ones! I miss him so much.

Had my last cigarette Sunday...these past three days have been literally painful.

I don't know what it is, but I've been coughing worse then I ever have, and my throat! Jesus Christ, it burns constantly. I can feel my entire respiratory system every breath I take. It's the start of the fourth day now, and I do feel it waning a bit, it's not as constant, but God does it feel heavy.

Anyone else have this happen? Like, *the worse* three day strep throat ever? I read it was just my cilia cleaning house, but fuck. I smoked for ten years, quit for two years, and this never happened then. I'd barely been smoking again for a year, and this is the response?

Smoker for 4 years, I've settled on a quit date

Hey everyone,

I know I haven't been smoking for nearly as long as some of you guys, but I've been wanting to quit for a long time.

I love smoking. It makes me feel good, it gives me some alone time, away from people, and I can listen to music. But my being a smoker just isn't what I want people to think of when they think of me.

I went to the Caribbean with my parents over Christmas and went 10 days without cigarettes. As soon as I got back to my apartment on NYE, I lit up again, and I've been slowly getting back on them. I feel really bad about it, and it's just terrible because everything makes me want to smoke.
Spending too much time around people. Schoolwork. Coffee. Alcohol. It's just so overwhelming and I've tried to quit so many times over the past 4 years.

But I really think I can do it. I've been frequenting r/stopdrinking for the past couple weeks and today next week will be 1 month without alcohol :D I'm gonna start drinking tea instead of coffee. I've downloaded and paid for the Smoke Free app because I saw that some here recommended that. I think I'm ready and I can't wait to be finished with this terrible, useless habit.

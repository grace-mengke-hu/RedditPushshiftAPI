4 days smoke free!

Can't believe how easy it's been to not pick up a cigarette and smoke. I don't have any push to go out for a smoke-in fact seeing someone smoke kind of turns me off now. 

Key thoughts right now are:
-Every cigarette I smoke is doing NOTHING (good) for me
-I've lived without smoking for the better part of my life and I can do it again

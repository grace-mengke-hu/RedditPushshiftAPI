Where are the withdrawal symptoms?

I was smoking up to a pack a day for the last 8 years, tried to quit numerous times and always failed because I had pretty severe withdrawal symptoms. After a few hours I started to sweat like a madman, my brain lost all capabilities required to think straight and I often nearly fell off my chair because my sense of balance was totally fubar. I don't even try to describe the cravings, they we're just off the charts and of course I never pulled through.


At this exact moment it's been 24 hours since my last cigarette and I'm hardly noticing any withdrawal symptoms at all. 

Is my body finally ready to quit? Or is it just my brain preparing for a massive counter-attack? I honestly don't know, but this feels a hell of a lot better than last time.

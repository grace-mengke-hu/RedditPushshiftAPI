Some inspiration for anyone considering lighting up today

I've always had a tough time quitting because I can't seem to wrap my head around the long-term consequences of smoking. Sure, I know I could die of heart attack, stroke, cancer, or emphysema - all directly caused by smoking. But I'm still in my 20s, I dont' have to worry, right? It couldn't be affecting me this young, right?

**Wrong.** On my last night as a smoker 8 days ago, I went for a 2-mile run that took me 27 minutes and resulted in 24 hours of really scary chest tightness and shortness of breath, among other symptoms mimicking a heart attack. Last night, just one week after quitting smoking, I finished a 5K run in 36 minutes, and I didn't feel overly winded or like my heart might explode from my chest. I am actually kind of amazed by how much my lung function has very obviously improved over just a matter of 8 days.

I also noticed the bags under my eyes are disappearing, and I certainly haven't been getting any more sleep or rest than usual.

It's easy to justify the smoking. To say the health consequences won't affect us for decades. But smoking is affecting every smoker's health right now, in the present, and the progress I've made with my running in just one week is proof.

Join me in not smoking today!!!

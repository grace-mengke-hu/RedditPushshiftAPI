11 months of no smoking and my parents are in the middle of a messy divorce.

I keep telling myself that smoking will not help in ANY scenario and that I will just hate myself after I smoke even one. Tonight there was an ESPECIALLY bad fight where my dad was freaking out and throwing shit and I had to get in the middle of the situation. I left the house about 10 minutes later and sat infront of a gas station for an hour going over it in my head over and over. I also have my first day at my new job where I will be gone for 5 - 6 days. I'm really hoping that this new job will be the distraction I need to get away from this situation.  I just hate this situation and it's really testing my limits, I kind of rationalized it in my head that by starting smoking again my parents will see how they're affecting me and that's my subliminal way of telling them how I feel? I dunno I'm just lost and rambling.

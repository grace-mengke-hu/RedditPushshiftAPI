418 days since I stopped smoking

This is meant to be a motivational text to you folks still struggling with this addiction. You can do it! You really can. Believe me when I say that I don't have any supernatural willpower that you folks don't have, all you have to do is read Alan Carr's work, hang out around this place for a little while when you still think you should just grab a smoke and light it up. 

Another important thing is when you actually do cave in. Don't just decide that all your effort was for naught. Instead realize that even a single unsmoked cigarette will do you good. So it's really about accumulating cigarettes that you don't smoke. If, for some reason you do light up, just think of why you are quitting, of how the tobacco industry is making a profit by a product which causes cancer. And it's just so cool when you quit. I actually don't have to think that I've cancer every time I feel some dryness in my throat or some discomfort in my chest and this results in significantly lower stress levels and a much happier life. Do it, quit smoking now!

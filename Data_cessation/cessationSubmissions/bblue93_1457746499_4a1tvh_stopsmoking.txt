My name is Mohd, and i am trying to stop smoking. Help!!

Hi,
i am a uni student and i smoke a pack perday, my roommate is a smoker (i live in dorms), and now i am  back home and my family do not know that i am a smoker (i think) so my smoking habits when i am home are very different when i am in uni, and i m going back in a week. when i am in my dorms i smoke whenever i want and i am a gamer and i play in a gaming-pc  cafe and smoking there is only allowed from 12 am to 12 pm and when i am there and not in these hours smoking breaks are often.

stopping smoking has crossed my mind every now and then and even asked my roommate if he would stop smoking in the room if i quit smoking and he is cool with it.

to be honest quitting smoking has been on my mind a lot lately but in my country they are doubling the price of cigs to the double (from ~2.67$ to ~ 5.33$) and that was my last straw.

i have now 5 packs(i know this is stupid but i wont destroy them i am planning to smoke them) and i do not want to quit cold turkey because i am studying to be a chemical engineering aka process engineer and i have midterms from 23/3 till 9/4 and i have to be mentally stable to get past them. 

i downloaded an app to quit in 30 days but i still think i need some help but without nicotine replacement therapy or any medicines.

can you help me?please! 

update1:OMG! thank you guys for all the support, i am really glad that i posted this, i had some doubts but now i know i can do it. in 29 days i will be smoking free i promise you that.

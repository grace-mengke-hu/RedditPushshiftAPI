Brand new. Havent smoked in 3 days. Surprisingly its actually getting easier.

I've been smoking since I was 19 and I'm 27 now. First day I stopped it had more to do with the fact that I couldn't afford a pack so I was just going to suffer and smoke butts for the day. However yesterday my nephew was born and my sister in law has been pretty clear that if I am smoking I won't be aloud around the baby (pretty ridiculous but maybe thats just cause im a smoker) and realistically I started thinking about it and realized this was a great reason to actually quit instead of just talking about quitting. Today I had one drag and it actually tasted nasty (kinda like drinking coke after not having any soda for a long time). Although the strangest thing was that I saw someone smoking at work today and for the first time in a long time, it looked gross. I really want it to last this time (I quit for a month once before but started up again when I was around other smokers). 

I do have a couple questions. 

1. Is there a good trick to use after you eat because I think thats the hardest time for me? 

2. My biggest fear is that I'm going to gain a bunch of weight because I will eat every time I get bored or any time I want a cig. Any one have insights into how to not have this happen? 

3. When I go out to bars and stuff is it ok to cheat or should I completely stop altogether?

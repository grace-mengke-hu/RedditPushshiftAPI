I don't want to quit smoking but I have to

I'm middle aged. I don't want to quit smoking. But the way I gasp for air some mornings means I have to.  I just don't know how I can do it. I smoked since I was a teen. I stopped here and there. The longest amount of time was near 5 years. I started about 4 years ago again.

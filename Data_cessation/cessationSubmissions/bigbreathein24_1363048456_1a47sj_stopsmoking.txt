Day One is tomorrow.

Going back up to Chicago to visit with my parents and young siblings and I hate smoking around them.  Will be there for about a week so I know this is the perfect time to get this done! 

I have Allen Carr packed, patches, sunflower seeds, feel-better ice cream rewards, and Settlers of Catan to play with friends.

This is going to work!

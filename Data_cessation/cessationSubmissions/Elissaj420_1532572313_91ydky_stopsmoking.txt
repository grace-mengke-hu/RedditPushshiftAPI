7th Day

This is my 7th day cold turkey. A week ago I was in the hospital for a prosthetic disc replacement and I promised my fiancé that I would quit. So I did. I noticed all my 9 panic attacks a day have gone. I read that a lot people suffer from panic attacks going through withdrawal, however, have any of you experienced the opposite scenario like me? It feels so good to not feel like I’m dying every hour. Funny, even with this wonderful benefit, I’m craving them like crazy. I was a pretty heavy smoker. I smoked close to 2 packs a day. My whole family besides my fiancé believes that I will fail. Right now, that’s how I’m getting through the cravings, sheer stubbornness. Please tell me your success stories so I can draw strength from your outcome.

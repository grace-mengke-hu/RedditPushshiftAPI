Substitute for smoking while driving?

So I'm at the 25 hour mark and feeling confident about my quit.  Half a pack a day for about 7 years.  

A year ago I moved to a city where I don't need a vehicle - prior to that, I used to light up in my car every time I got in, even it was just a 5 minute drive to the grocery store.  

I just moved back and will begin driving again, with 3 long drives coming up, first one this Friday: (two 3 hour drives and a 7 hour drive.) long drives by myself used to excite me because it was prime chain smoking time.  

I'm nervous about caving and wondering if anyone has found a good technique for distracting the mind in that situation (without distracting it too much because, you know, driving.)

Thanks!  So glad I found this sub.  You all inspire me!  I hope I can be back for a successful one year post next summer.

EDIT: 2 three hour drives this past weekend- I traveled with a case of water, a couple hundred mint toothpicks, and pulled over once to get through a bad craving.  Used to chain a full pack in a 3 hour trip.  This weekend? ZERO.  Thanks for your help everyone!

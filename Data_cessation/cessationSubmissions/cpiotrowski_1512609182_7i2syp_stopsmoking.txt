I quit smoking

As of Sunday night I am a nonsmoker.

I’m trying to work at a hospital and they all           nicotine test now - I figure it had to happen sooner or later. 

I’ve been smoking since I was 15 (now I’m going on 25).

I don’t have a problem when I keep myself busy it’s when I have nothing to do or when I find myself getting super cranky over nothing. 

The worst part is the coughing and trouble breathing and increased anxiety. I know smoking won’t help but I feel like maybe it will somehow?

       Any tips or advice?

Also I quit cold turkey (this is my second time first time lasted 4 months).

This week I also have college finals &amp; a very stressful week at work so I’m trying to keep a positive mindset.

Anybody notice their sense of smell has increased since they quit smoking

Picture
Approximately 36 days ago, I quit smoking. Cold turkey. Since then I have not had a cigarette. I also have avoided any sort of nicotine replacement product such as the electronic cigarette or the gum. Hell, I haven’t even licked a chain smoker to get some of that sweet, sweet nicotine. 

I have discovered the world smells like shit,
When I smoked, I would constantly just smell like…smoke. Now I don’t, I simply smell like all other manner of foul body odor. The first two weeks after I quit, I was showering three times a day because I thought I was filthy. Again, this is something that non-smokers don’t realize because they’ve simply gotten used to the way they smell. But when you quit smoking and finally find out what you actually smell like, you kind of want to barf all the time.
The other day at work I smelled something I thought was burning in the building then a co-worker told me it was popcorn coming from the lunch room. I was walking from my car to go inside grocery store and in my path was some one smoking. I had no choice to confront the smell as I entered the doors to go in the building, and man that was a hair raising sensation.

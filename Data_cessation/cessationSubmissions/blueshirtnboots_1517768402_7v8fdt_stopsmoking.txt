Currently at day 86, i can:

Eat a lot more (good for gaining muscles)
Feel my lung expand to the point that i could easily breath more than i need (you‘ll understand when you get there)
Get those relaxing big breathes of air (they feel amazing)
Easily go on a train ride for a couple of hours without constantly thinking about smoking or being pissed or having negative thoughts
Have much more energy (automatically taking walks instead of taking the subway which is so great and feels and is really healthy)
Have more fun in the club (not being exhausted after 3 minutes of shuffling) 
Being able to give 100% of yourself in the gym, especially doing cardio
Being able to go on a date with a nonsmoker and not having to plan to not smoke 30 min before goig in for the kiss
Making your own family proud and take the concerns of them about your health away
Having a lot whiter teeth 
Coca Cola tastes a lot better (tastes like shit as a smoker in comparison

wish me luck, everyone!

I was always a casual smoker, starting at 13, now I'm 24. Just bumming cigarettes off friends, smoking at parties. etc. Not very often. I still live at home, and my parents would kill me if they ever found out I smoked, so I've been able to keep it somewhat under control. About six months ago, after a messy relationship that ended in him leaving me for another woman, I smoked so much, more than I've ever smoked before. Close to a pack a day. How my parents didn't notice or smell it on me, I have no idea. 

I decided to officially quit a few days ago. I've been cutting back a lot over the past month or so. Three main reasons:

1.) People have always complimented me on my teeth and my smile. It's a bit of a point of pride for me. I don't want to ruin it! And although my oral hygiene is very good, I just can't get the whiteness like I used to!

2.) I am a workout fanatic. Really. 2+ hours of cardio and lifting EVERY DAY. And personal training sessions 4x a week. People are always surprised, and very disappointed, when they find out I smoke, because I've always been the fitness queen. I feel like it clashes so much with my fitness goals and my desire to live healthily. 

3.) At the time I was going through the pain and emotional turmoil of the relationship and watching my life crumble around me, I felt that smoking was the best stress reliever, especially sitting around and smoking and crying and ranting with friends. Angrily sucking down a cigarette. We've all done it. Looking back, I realize that although it felt satisfying at the time, there were probably better ways I could have dealt with my stress. Here's to productivity! 

So, here we go. Looking at all of your success stories is very encouraging. You seem like an awesome group :)

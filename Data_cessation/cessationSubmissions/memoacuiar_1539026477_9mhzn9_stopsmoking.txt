Really, how is tobacco legal?

I managed to go 18 hours without smoking. That's a big feat for me. Eventually, the cravings got So bad I felt homicidal. Everything pissed me off and I hated myself for it, as I knew there was no reason to hate people and situations just because I couldnt get poison in my lungs. I literally wanted to cause mayhem in the mall, but only murmured a few "shits" and "fuck these fuckers, goddamn normal-smelling people".

Needless to say, I immediately spent 9€ on rolling tobacco and resumed my normal rate of smoking, feeling like a dissonant prick for each puff I took, even though I thought I had thoroughly convinced myself that I would not smoke. By going back to being a slave to nicotine, I became " normal" again. What the fuck kind of mind control shit is this... I know all the reasons not to smoke, but I also know all the reasons to do so, and they are far more persuasive in the heat of the cravings. The nicotine literally robs you of your free will and turns you into a monster. This is a legal drug that you can get anywhere. This is something that is for sale in the 21st century. 

Also, I am a 21st century man who fell for this old, ridículous trap. There are so many better ways to die.

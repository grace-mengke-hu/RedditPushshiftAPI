When your partner has no intention of quitting but you are desperate to.

Ok guys I'm feeling like crap. I'm coughing up shit constantly, my lungs feel tight and painful.. I have no energy. I hate smoking. I've tried to quit so many times I am beginning to hate myself for caving in.

I need to stay alive. I have kids. I am determined to quit. 

One big problem is my girlfriend has zero intention  of quitting and is truly unsupportive when I do try. She actually says things like "you don't smoke that much..." I smoke 20 a day and have done for 20 years. Even if it was 5 a day. It's too much. It just makes it a lot harder to stop.

I've been through every single method. All nicotine replacement, ecigs, hypnosis, Allen carr.

I'm going to try Allen Carr again. Just feeling a bit fed up with it all right now...

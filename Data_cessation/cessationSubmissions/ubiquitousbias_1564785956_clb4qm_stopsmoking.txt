Eating and drinking alcohol more !

I have successfully finished 9 days.. however I noticed that I have been eating more than usual and tend to also drink more alcohol. I used to jaut have one beer daily before. Now I have three! Now it could also be that I am in between jobs now and have really nothing to do all day! Trying to keep myself busy with books..

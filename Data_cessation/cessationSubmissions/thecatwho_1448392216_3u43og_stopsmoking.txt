53 hours smoke free and struggling...

I've smoked about a pack a day for 7 years, attempted to quit cold turkey once about 2 years ago and made it 2 weeks. I've never voluntarily wanted to quit, and am still only quitting for a job. 
After going about 30 hours straight cold turkey I nearly broke, so I went and got some juice for my vape pen. The plan is a week with nictibe, then a week cut in half, then go no nicotine. The trouble is, I like smoking. Vaping has never been enjoyable for me. I'm sure I need an attitude adjustment about this, but for the most part I find anti smoking propaganda to be trite and slightly overblown so it generally makes me want to smoke out of spite than encourage me to quit. The only reason I'm quitting is for a job, one that I definitely want, but it's still only one reason. I guess right now what I'm looking for is more distractions, more things to help take the edge off of my cravibgs, and strategies to keep me on the straight and narrow. And even if I don't get any responses, the five minutes I took to type this have been slightly cathartic so that's helpful in and of itself.

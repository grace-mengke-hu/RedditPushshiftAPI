Cottage weekend with smokers and a patio...

...And I didn't smoke once. Not even a single puff. 

I'm 13 days into my first quit (23 years old - 5 year smoker), and I'm super proud to say that I have abstained through some pretty difficult temptations (and some personal high stress situations), including 4 days in a cottage with people smoking pipes, cigars, cigarettes, alcohol and weed (in batched joints - made sure to ask before indulging).

I had a dream the first night that I desperately wanted a smoke, so I had one. Two puffs in, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of such intense guilt that it woke me up and I felt awful the rest of the day. 

This helped me to realize how proud of myself I am for making it this far, and how happy I am to finally feel a little bit free. 

I know it's the beginning of a long road, but I absolutely never want to have another puff again. 

It feels like I'm in a competition with myself to see how long I can go, but because I'm the only one playing...I'm always winning. And I love winning more than smoking ;)

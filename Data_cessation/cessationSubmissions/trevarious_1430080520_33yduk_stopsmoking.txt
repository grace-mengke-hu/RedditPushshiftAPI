Worried about the evening

I am going to see a few friends tonight and they all smoke. I am pretty worried as i feel like this is the hardest thing about quitting. I quit cold turkey and was thinking about getting the patch for tonight to help with the craving, but feel as that is cheating.

EDIT: A few good cravings, but made it through last night, and feel GREAT about it!

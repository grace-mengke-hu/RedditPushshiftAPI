10 days - Need to vent

I 'm just a couple of hours from the 10 days mark and life just seems so difficult. I feel like my motivation to do anything is completely gone. I feel like I'm unable to do even the simplest task. It just took me like 30 minutes to get my laundry into the washing machine and turn it on. It's maddening. My addicted mind is telling me that I just can't make it through life without nicotine. I think the initial cravings were pretty easy to resist, but this is harder. I don't feel that I physically need nicotine, but my mental state is just a mess and part of me believes that I truly need it to function. My focus is shot and I just get endlessly lost into mindless activities. I'm anxious as hell, since I just can't seem to keep my act together. It's hard to describe the state I'm in right now. It's like some kind of limbo where time doesn't exist. Please tell me it gets better.

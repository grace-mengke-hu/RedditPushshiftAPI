Looking for Help to stop

Hello everyone,

It's my first post here on reddit, I hope I am doing this right.
So I have been a smoker for four years and I have tried to quit 3 times now. My most recent attempt last 6-7months and i went back to it a couple of weeks ago. I was really drunk and everybody I was with was smoking and I gave in. I am a strong addict so I came back to it as if I never stopped. Not sure what else say I really want to stop and I thought I could ask for some advice on reddit. 

Thank you all :)

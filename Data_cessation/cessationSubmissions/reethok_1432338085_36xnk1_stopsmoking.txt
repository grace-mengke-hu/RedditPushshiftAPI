Quit suddenly, or gradually reduce the number of cigarettes?

Hello. I have been smoking for around 2 years now. From 10 to 20 cigarettes per day. 

Tonight, I forgot to buy cigarettes before coming to my night shift, and I started getting really crazy about it. I was even thinking of looking for a 24h tobacco store and go buy one.  I realized how irrational it is and now I want to quit. I'm scared I don't have the mental strength to do it, though.  
  
So... Should I quit for once or try reduring the numbers gradually? 
 
I'm just afraid I will get home and first thing I'll do is smoke one. 
  
Btw, do the carvings get worse or viceversa over time? 
 
Thanks!

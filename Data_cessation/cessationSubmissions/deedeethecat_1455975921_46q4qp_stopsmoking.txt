What to do about today

Last night I had incredibly strong cravings. I dealt with them the way I dealt with alcohol cravings, I'm also an alcoholic in recovery, and that was by saying I'm not going to smoke today, I can smoke tomorrow. In theory, how this works, is that I do the same thing today.

But every part of my brain wants to pick up cigarettes!

I'm so frustrated because I quit in January and then recently relapsed and I don't want to go through this cycle again. But that is where I am headed if I don't deal with this craving!

I'm gonna try putting off smoking until tomorrow, but to be honest that technique doesn't seem to be working this time. I am going to continue to distract myself and chew some nicotine gum.

Any feedback, ideas, or hugs would be welcome!

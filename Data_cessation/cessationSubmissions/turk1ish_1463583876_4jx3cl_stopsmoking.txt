Week one!

I still need to get on desktop reddit so i can update my flair.

However, i am now at week one! I can honestly say that having to reset the counter on my phone app has been a huge reason why i haven't smoked yet.

This week started off pretty easy, but yesterday and this morning have been really hard. I've been a bit stressed waiting for payday, so that might be it.

I've been doing a lot of hiking, writing, and walking around to try and keep my mind off of smoking. I had my first shot of adrenaline for the first time in a long time come up after a pretty intense climb yesterday.

Also, after the hike, i talked to a really cute girl and i feel like i wouldn't have gotten her number if i smelled like smoke (i see her on Thursday. Wish me luck!)

Sorry for the wall of text guys. Just needed to talk about it with someone.

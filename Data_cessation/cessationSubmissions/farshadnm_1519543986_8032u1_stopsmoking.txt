what to do when craving Smokes?

Hi everyone. it's been 24 hours for me. i had quit before for like 2 weeks and once 9 months. but now i don't know what to do when i'm craving a cigarette. it's not just about the nicotine, it's also about having something in your hand, just having something to do when you're on a break. what are some suggestions? i read somewhere about sucking air through a straw. i'm not sure about that.
what do you guys do?

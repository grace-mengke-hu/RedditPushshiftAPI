28 hours smoke free after ten years of smoking, having a hard time.

I'm 24, have been smoking since I was 13-14. I have quit before, the longest being 5 months about two years ago. But this time. This time is absolutely brutal. I have no energy to do anything, I have a constant ache in my chest and I'm extremely irritable and sensitive. I am so scared I don't have the self control to even go outside right now but I have work in the morning.

How do you guys take control of your brain when withdrawaling? How do you say no when it is so much easier to go out and but a pack? I dunno I'm feeling a little down on myself and somewhat weak willed right now.... Any advice is appreciated.

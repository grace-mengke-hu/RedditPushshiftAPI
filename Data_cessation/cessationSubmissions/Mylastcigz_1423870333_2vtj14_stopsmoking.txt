Twenty two days.. and the glide begins...

Someone said, if you do an activity for 21 days without a break ... it becomes a habbit.. I do not konw if I smoked continuously for 21 days to get addicted for a good 24 years of smoking.. but this attempt to quit is probably my third time that i made up to 22 days.. first attempt went up for 6 months, second for 4 months and start to cheat for a couple of months and back to normal... and this one.. just hitting the glider phase... after this period until 4-5 months is a good smooth glide and can be away .. not sure what happens after that.. somewhere something goes wrong and I m back to the habit.. This time.. hoping to get past 6 months..

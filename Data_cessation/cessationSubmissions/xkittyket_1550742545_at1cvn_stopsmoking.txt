Day 3. I’ve been smoking a pack a day for over 10 years.

It’s no big deal compared to so many on here, but its the longest I’ve gone without a cigarette in as long as I can remember! I’m so excited! Every time the cravings hit, I remind myself that I’ve made it through the first hour/12hrs/24hours, so why can’t I do another hour/12hrs/24hrs more? Also, I don’t want the past 80hrs to be for nothing. Another thing I tell myself is that another day that I pull through is another day closer to when it finally does get easier. 

It’s so silly, but I can’t wait to say that I haven’t smoked for a week, a month... etc. I really hope that my resolve remains steadfast through this period. 

Last night, I was with my friends (who don’t know that I’ve quit) at a bar and they asked if I’d like to head downstairs for a smoke. I told them that I’m fine, and that I didn’t have any on me anyway. One of them offered me one, but I managed to refuse. 6 hours later, I went home smoke-free! 

It helps so much that my boyfriend has been so supportive. It’s cute how he celebrates with me and praises me. He still smokes, but I’ve noticed that he has cut down tremendously since I stopped. He hasn’t even finished the pack that we got 4 days ago. 

Taking on a positive perspective towards all of this (instead of being upset that it is so hard to quit) has helped tremendously. I’m happy that my appetite is back. I eat every time I’m craving, and hopefully my weight goes back to what it once was. I’m happy that my hair and clothes smell great all day. I’m happy I don’t have to stand out on the balcony when the weather is sweltering hot right now just to get my fix. I’m happy to slowly leave this dependency behind, to not have to plan my days around my smokes, to finally regain some self-control. Most of all, I’m happy that I didn’t smoke today, and I hope the same for anyone reading this! x

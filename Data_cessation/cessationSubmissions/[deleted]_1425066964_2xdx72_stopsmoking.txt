Okay guys, today is the day

Hello, I have been smoking for 3 years, pack a day for 2 1/2 years. I tried to quit in January but caved in after 4 days. I only have one half cig left and after i smoke that I'm going to be strong and not buy any more packs. i'm going to be browsing this sub a lot while i am still craving them. does anybody have any advice for when youre chilling with your friends and theyre smoking cigs, because ill crave them the most then.  i'm thankful for this subreddit

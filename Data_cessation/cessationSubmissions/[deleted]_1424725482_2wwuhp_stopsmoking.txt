20 days a non smoker already! I haven't felt that good in a long time.

I can drink and not need a smoke, I can be bored and not need a smoke and especially I can be excited and not need a smoke. 

It wasn't completely easy, but knowing from day one (yes, Allen Carr influence), that I will stay smoke free for ever was and is (still it's just day 20) extremely helping. Never was I doubting, even through the hardest craving, that I will give in. At the same time, this makes the hardest craving feel like listening to an unfunny joke several times again. Only annoying, but not threatening.

Thanks everyone for posting in here and making people smoke free.

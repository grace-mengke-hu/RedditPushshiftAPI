The morning after.

I freaking did it! I was smoke free for 24 hours. Well it's 36 hours about now so I've done even better.

I was supposed to have a short and easy day at work yesterday, but I ended up doing overtime and had zero breaks the whole day, it was annoying as hell. I had a patch and chew a few gums throughout the day, but I was very close to smoking several times, but I didn't have any with me so I couldn't and in the end the cravings went away anyway.

When I got home I quickly took my "just in case" pack and gave it to my mother who lives nearby. I can't have any near me right now, call me weak, but I don't feel like tempting myself unnecessarily.

Today I'm only having a Nicotine patch, if things get bad I have gum, but I'm doing my best not to take those. I have a few small projects to do today and to keep myself busy

Pros after day one

* My heart rate is normalized
* Breathing feels better, I've felt lightheaded from all dat oxygen a few times :D

Cons:

* Concentrating is a bit hard at times when cravings are bad.

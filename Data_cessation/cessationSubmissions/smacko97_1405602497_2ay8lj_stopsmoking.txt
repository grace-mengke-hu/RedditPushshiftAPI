I'm gonna win this time

I have been a smoker for like 1.5 years now. not super long I know, but im also a saxophone player so every cigarette is like me nailing my dreams to the wall and pummeling them in the face. I didnt smoke regularly until I moved to asia where FUCKING EVERYONE SMOKES  and it costs less than 3 dollars a pack. I was working a day job 9-6:30 then a night job of playing music almost every night and for some reason I convinced myself smoking helped me cope w stress. I used to smoke weed back in the states but its mad illegal here so I turned to cigarettes  anyways finally quitting for the last time and looking forward to being a non-smoker again. all the posts and comments here have really helped me decide to quit. just smoked my last cig like 30 mins ago. I got this shit.
tl; dr r/stopsmoking is awesome and im sticking to it this time for real

humble advice

cravings and hunger for food feels the same to me as it is to most people (if not all). I was pissed that i still had constant cravings for a ciggy through out the day. then i realised something. they weren't cravings per se. i was actually hungry . Eating whatever i want in a mindful manner solved the problem. so my advice is don't fight at 2 fronts at the same time. quitting is more important. you can deal with weight gain later.

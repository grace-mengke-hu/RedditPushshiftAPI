That "starting a lawnmower" sound:

You know...the one you make when you're trying to clear your through that just sounds like you're trying to start a cold or old lawnmower? 

Well, I do believe that unpleasant sound I used to make is 99.5% gone! So I need to cling to that during cravings.

Hope you are all well today!

Need advice from people who've tried different ways to quit..

So, I've been a smoker for about 7 years now, smoking about a pack a day on average. I've been able to quit several times but only make it a week or two before I cave. I've tried the patches, they irritate my skin. I've tried the gum and lozenges and can't stand the taste. I've tried the e-cigarette which has been the most successful but not for long. I've even read Allen Carr's book which so many people recommend. None of it has worked. 


The thing is, I like to smoke. I enjoy smoking in general, and the breathing in and out calms my anxiety. I want to quit because I know it's terrible for me and also because my family and boyfriend have asked me to. 


Has anyone else had a hard time, even with trying multiple ways of quitting? What ended up working? I feel like I just don't have the willpower to do it.

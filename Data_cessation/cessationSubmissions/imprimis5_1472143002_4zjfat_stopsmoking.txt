Two months!

I'm two months in, y'all. This is super exciting.

I still want a smoke now and then. Like, every once in a while, a cigarette just sounds soooooo good. But that passes so quickly, and then I completely forget about smoking (until the next time). I'm thinking in another month or so, even that will be rare.

Thanks for letting me be excited. :-)

Day 23 Smoke Free

I am proud to say that I am a non-smoker. It was really tough in the beginning but it does get so much easier as time goes by. I just want to encourage everyone to hang in there. There is not one single good reason to smoke but there are a million good reasons to quit!! I highly recommend using the "smoke free" app. It gives you something to do everytime you have a craving and is very motivational. We got this habit beat!! "Not one more puff!!"

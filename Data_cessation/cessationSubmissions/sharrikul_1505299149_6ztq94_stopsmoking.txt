Little realisation: the physical habit is itself the main addiction

During the moment I decided to stop feeding my chewing tobacco addiction, I realised that I did not crave the nicotine as such, but I only chewed tobacco because it had become such a routine in my life that my mind looked to engaging in it to ensure normality.

During the next few weeks after quitting, I did not really get cravings for chewing tobacco to feel good, but I did get cravings when I would find myself in times or places when I usually would have a chew.

I realise I'm just repeating what is known, but I do believe a little reminder here and there is a good thing in one's journey.

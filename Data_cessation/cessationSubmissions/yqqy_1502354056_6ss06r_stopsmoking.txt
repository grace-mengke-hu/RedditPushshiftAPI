"just one" actually matters, TIL

i had a run of almost two weeks and i started to get the feeling of kind of like, already "having quit". i actually didn't really even get cravings, didn't think about smoking, could actually go without even nicotine gum, things were looking good.

now for some reason i don't totally fathom, i wasn't even drunk, i bummed a cig off a friend, bc one can't harm right? well yeah. i feel like it totally obliterated my process. not only in the sense of wrecking my impressive day count but i feel like i'm back again at the point i started, thinking about smoking and seriously considering buying a pack and i've been chewing gum all day now. 

i won't buy the god damn pack, i won't bum one off some randos off the street but i'm so frustrated at my own stupidity.

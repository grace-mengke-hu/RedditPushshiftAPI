just piling on

I was stopped for 10 years before picking it back up 2 years ago.

I stopped again 2 days ago. I say stopped because I know now, like an aloholic, I might fall off the wagon and start again.

But right now, Im battling and am not smoking.

I dont see many posts of people who quit with the patch. I used it the last time I stopped and am using it again this time.

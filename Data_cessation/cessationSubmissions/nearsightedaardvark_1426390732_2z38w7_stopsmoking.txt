Bad cravings two weeks in, plus some fears

Tomorrow marks two weeks of tobacco abstinence and for some reason, the cravings tonight are the worst yet. Several months ago, a good friend of mine quit for a few months at least and now she's back to smoking. Seeing as how she was such an inspiration to me, I am suddenly struck by the fear that I will make it a month or two or three before something happens and I'm back to it. I guess these are the nic fit blues I've heard so much about. That's the trouble with the pink cloud. You've got a long way to fall from it. Sorry to be a bummer and also for any typos, I'm doing this over mobile.

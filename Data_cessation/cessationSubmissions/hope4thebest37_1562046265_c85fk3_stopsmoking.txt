Back to day 1

After 16 years of smoking I am trying my hardest this time to quit. I have the juul and was doing fine just completed the 4th day of no cigarettes. Had some turbulence at the homestead and smoked 2 cigarettes within an hour. Reset my progress on smoke free app. I can say this though..I am more determined now to quit smoking than ever before. I hope the best for everyone here and good luck on your journey

I've almost managed to quit

Hi, I have been a social smoker for approximately 3 years and in the last period I was smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day which was a lot to me. I suddenly stopped, decided I want to get over with nicotine, 5 weeks have passed and I'm pretty happy with what I have achieved. During this time I smoked 4 times, all of them were after drinking alcohol, which makes it for me basically impossible to say no to a cigarette. How do I get rid of this? I do I get rid of this craving? When I'm sober I do not want to smoke, the smell of smoke bothers me, but when I drink I crave a cigarette and enjoy it as it was the best pleasure I can have. Will this go away? And how?

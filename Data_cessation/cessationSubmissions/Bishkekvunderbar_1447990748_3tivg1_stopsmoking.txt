Accountability Post

Hey all, I've just smoked my last cigarette (once again). 

Backstory: I was doing great for three weeks, got drunk, slid right back into it. Then managed to stay off for a couple weeks, got depressed, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. 

After lighting up again for a week, I've noticed how regardless of whether I'm smoking or not, I go through the same periods of ups and downs, anger, sadness, happiness, whatever. It has nothing to do with smoking. Plus I smell like shit, can't breathe, can't sleep, and have stopped working out and meditating. Smoking is sapping the life from me.

I'm writing this post for accountability, as I think being a lurker on this sub is less helpful than being an active participant. I plan to post my observations while I quit, as well as asking for support during the rougher patches. Unfortunately I find the worst times when I'm at my work, and not able to post there, but will make an effort to post when I can.

Thanks for listening and here it goes!

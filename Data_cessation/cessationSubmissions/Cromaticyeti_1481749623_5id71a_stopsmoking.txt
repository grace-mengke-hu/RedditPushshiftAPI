I think it's time but I need advice

I bought a pack today, everytime I buy a pack I think to myself I won't buy another after this pack..I have been smoking since I was 16 or 17 I'm in my mid 20's now I want to quit. But every time i start to it seems I am an asshole for every situation that comes to my attention. I have tried patches the nicotine gum. They don't help I even vaped and quit for 4 months but as soon as my pen broke I bought a pack. One of my buddies told me to try salty stuff like sunflower seeds..but do you all have any suggestions on what to try?

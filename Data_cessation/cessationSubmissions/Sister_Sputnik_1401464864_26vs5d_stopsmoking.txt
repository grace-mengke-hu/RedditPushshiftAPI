Are there any other writers trying to quit around here?

I'm stoked about going nearly 3 weeks without smoking, but I also haven't done any work the whole time. I have a project that needs attention (deadline!) and tried to work on it yesterday, but it was torture. I couldn't focus, couldn't sit still, couldn't think -- and I hated every second of it. 

Today is do or die. I need to make a dent in this work. I'm wondering if anyone else here has learned to write without a cigarette in your hand. What has your experience been? How did you do it? Do you still enjoy writing? Does it get better?

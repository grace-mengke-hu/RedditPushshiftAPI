I think I'm finally ready.

I've been a smoker for a good few years now, and after previous attempts to quit have failed, I'm ready to give it another go.  IDK why, but it feels different this time.  I truly dislike the act of smoking anymore, and find myself wondering "why the fuck am I out here smoking right now?"  I've picked my stop date and Im ready to rock!

Looking forward to a new start.

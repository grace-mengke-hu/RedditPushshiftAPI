25 days. 3 smokes. But teetering.

Making a solid push here ... I had two cigarettes 10 days in, managed to shut it down, but then bummed one last night waiting for the bus. I can feel the urges stronger today even though it was a Parliament Light - pretty quick smoke. I know I can make it further and I'm leaving tomorrow to visit family so that's easy to manage. But starting to get concerned about the long term, weekends home alone with nothing to do. This is always my problem - I can mostly stop, but never fully quit. Any suggestions for making that push? at this point it feels just mental.

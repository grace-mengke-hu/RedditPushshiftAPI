Question about Pot

i am smoke free for a month now was a 1.5 pack a day smoker for 6 years and i feel really normal. i dont feel that i need it anymore even all of my friends are smokers. will smoking pot reset my progression and take me back to my craving phase? btw sorry for my english not a native speaker

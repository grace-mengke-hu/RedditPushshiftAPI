At two months I ...

... can comfortably run two kilometers, and climb for hours.

... can taste and smell the world as it's supposed to taste and smell. 

... have had a massive boost to my self-confidence. I have a shot with someone; the closest representation of "my perfect woman" that I've ever met. 

... have saved over $1,000AU.

... have shaken up my best friend enough for him to want to quit, too.

... have made my mother incredibly happy.

... no longer feel stressed and uncomfortable if I am facing a prolonged length of time where I know I can't smoke. 

... don't like the smell of cigarettes any more. 

Most importantly, I don't look at people with lots of months / years on their counter and wonder how they got there. Now I understand I don't have to work hard to get a high number; now, I understand that I just have to be patient. I feel like that is an incredibly important shift in the way I *feel* about my addiction, and the way I *felt* about my addiction. 

At two months... I feel like I've got this.

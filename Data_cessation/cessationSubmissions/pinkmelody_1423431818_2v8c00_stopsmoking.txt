Dat smell doe

The smell of cigarettes grosses me out so bad right now.  It's so unbelievably repulsive that I get intensely furious thinking about it.  Every time I walk by someone smoking the smell makes me hate them- especially more than anyone who has never smoked.  I think my sense of smell has improved so much that I'm hypersensitive to the fucking reek.  Anyone else had this happen?

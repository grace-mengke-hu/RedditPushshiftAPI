Day 4, and my goal for the day

I'm now on my fourth day without smoking, and I'm setting a goal for myself: To not use my (zero-nicotine) e-cig even once today. If I get the urge to have a drag... eat some fruit, do a few push-ups, pop a piece of gum in my mouth. Anything to help break the habit of needing to hold something between my fingers and take a drag off it.

edit: I can't spell "gum" properly.

Quit Date?

I quit 28 days ago. One day last week I slipped up. Can I still claim my quit date as 28 days ago, or do I have to reset my quit date? I know it is MY date, but it seems like a lie to say 28 days smoke free, but also seems like a lie to say 6 days smoke free. Like I'm not giving myself the credit for all those days before the slip... ugh. quitting is SO hard.

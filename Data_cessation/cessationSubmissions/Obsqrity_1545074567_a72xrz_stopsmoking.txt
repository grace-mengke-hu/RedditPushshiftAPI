Day 1

I am feeling super anxious, shaking my leg, biting my nails and I'm fiddling with almost everthing near me. It sucks cause I want to smoke but refuse to. I don't have any left anyways and won't bum off of people. I left my cash on home on purpose so I wouldn't go on my lunch to buy smokes. It helps to type this out cause my fingers are moving quite quickly and somehow helps with the crave.

I just got the smokefree app today and it told me that on average, I spend a total of about $1,000 a year on cigarettes. That was outrageous to me and honestly a huge motivator for me to stop. I could use that money for something way better. 

Update on day 2 tomorrow.

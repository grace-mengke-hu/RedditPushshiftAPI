First time since I quit

First time drinking since I've quit smoking. I've been avoiding drinking like the plague since I quit, but gonna have to deal with it at some point. 

People that I've talked to that drink and don't smoke are always like " it's easy I have no urge to smoke while drinking" which my response is always " we'll then you don't know the magic that a smoke while drunk is"

That being said I don't feel the need to smoke so far. For once I have a few drinks in me and the idea of going out in the cold and powering through a smoke doesn't sound like a good idea! It sounds ridiculous!

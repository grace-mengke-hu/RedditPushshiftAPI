A week in

So, it's been a week since I last posted here and since I've had any form of nicotine. I'm so happy to have made it through the withdrawal part. 

I type this as I lay low through my usual yoga class. I have lost so much sleep these past nights and had to take some breaks from my usual participation in life. No more than 6 hours of sleep each night and not totally restful. But the struggle is totally worth it!

I've been passed vapes or offered cigarettes in the situations I've mentioned in my last post but used the advice of taking a "high road" approach. Internally I kept an attitude that I don't participate in lower behaviors. Externally I just said "I don't vape" or "I don't vape anymore."

Happy to be doing this nonsmoker stuff one day at a time. And thanks guys for your advice last weekend!

Newbie here!

Hey guys! I'm a newbie to this subreddit, and I'm glad to see that this exists. Quitting smoking had been such a challenge for me, I've tried ECIG, Wellbutrin, Patches, Gum, and cold turkey.  The best method I have found was working out and patches but I still can't stop running to cigarettes after a fight or a depressing life event.  I bet tobacco companies love reading stories like this. Question, what vice have you replaced smoking with in your life? I'm 31, been smoking since 18, I'm no way a heavy smoker at all, I don't really buy packs of cigarettes anymore, I just bum and smoke friends, but I still need to quit that too. I need to quit all together completely. I don't want to end up dead....any advice??

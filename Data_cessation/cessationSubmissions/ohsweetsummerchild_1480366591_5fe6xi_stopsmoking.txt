Day One.

Today is day one. Not the first day one, but day one all the same. Resetting my flair sucked. Giving in to Queen Nicotine sucked even more. I find I'm not as grouchy this attempt as I have been in past attempts... so far. I just need to keep reminding myself that I am doing myself a favour, not denying myself something I need.

Wish me luck in my endeavors!

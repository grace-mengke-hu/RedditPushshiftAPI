I'm almost through day one.

I've decided to quit smoking (third time) but I'm more ready now than I was before. I recently made some big life choices and quit drinking. I also found a great personal trainer, am eating better and have been looking and feeling better than ever before. With this health-kick in mind, I knew I had to quit the cigarettes. Eight years of smoking has been eight years too long. I turned 24 yesterday and couldn't think of a better gift to myself. Here's hoping that next year I can say I'll be welcoming my first smoke-free year.

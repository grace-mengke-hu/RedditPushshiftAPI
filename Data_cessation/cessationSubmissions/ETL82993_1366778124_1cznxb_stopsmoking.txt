Seven days.

I've noticed a lot of things that have made me happier over this past week.Smelling the cologne you put on hours ago is such an amazing feeling. Every food that I enjoyed while I smoked has gotten a trillion times better since I've quit. It got tough the first couple days with the cravings, I walked into three different stores but fought the urge. The first couple days cigarettes smelled good no matter on what or who. But now? Quite the opposite. Also a thank you for this subreddit, on day 1-4 this got me through the worst of timesTl:dr : im not out of the woods yet, but take it one day at a time. It doesn't take long to get over the initial cravings.

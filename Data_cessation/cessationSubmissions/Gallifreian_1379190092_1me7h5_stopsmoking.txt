10 Days in.

I am coughing so much, but its just my throat healing ( I was sick when I quit, I used it as an excuse) but it's okay, I think I've got this. Me and my boyfriend are quitting together after years of enabling each other and we're getting through it!

  I really miss going outside with my dog for 15 minute intervals though... any advice?

Been non smoker for 2 months then I relapsed...After 3 months I am starting again! and for good!

I can honestly say that those 2 non smoking months very very hard in the beginning but only after two weeks I felt it was getting easier. I didn't even need cigarettes anymore and I actually felt sorry for people who smoked. And I can say I truly enjoyed my new non smoking life and I felt so liberated and happy. But only after two months I relapsed. I craved cigarette and lit it but hated it only after two puffs...and in a few weeks forward I actually made myself to be a smoker on purpose and idk why!? Now I am addicted again!! How stupid am I?? Now I am starting again. Wish me luck guys, and congrats on your decision to be a non smoker. It is the best decision of our lives :)

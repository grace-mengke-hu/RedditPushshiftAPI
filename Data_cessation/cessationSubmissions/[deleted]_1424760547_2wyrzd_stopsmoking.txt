Far to long and I'm trying.

Peace to all,just found this sub and just gonna shot this out.
Almost a year now and I'm "trying" to quite the smokes,I have some days that I just snap and don't smoke for a day or two but the next day it's as if nothing happened.
I hate it that the smokes are stronger then me.
I hate it I break the promise I made to myself.
I hate the fact that I can't quit.
So what I'm I trying to get at here?
I need advice,hard strong on advice on how to keep up the smoke free hours/days/weeks.
To the ones who HAVE quite the smokes successfully,what helped you the most to get where you are now?
With what habits have you replaced the smokes?
Thank you

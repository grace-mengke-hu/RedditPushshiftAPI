Patches and sleep issues?

Nicotine patches give the option to wear them for 16 or 24 hours (to sleep with or without it). If I go to bed without it, I don't sleep, even with use of melatonin. If I go to bed with it, my dreams are insane and lately have been absolutely horrible.

Any ideas? Am I just going to have to suffer through it? I've been doing well with quitting for the most part this time (more dedicated I think, that's a different point), just irritable from sleep deprivation.

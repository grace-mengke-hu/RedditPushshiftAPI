My Last Cigarette

At 11:37 AM, just a few minutes ago. Of course this isn't the first time I've tried to quit, but damnit, it'll be the last.

It's gotten to the point where smoking scares me on a visceral, existential level. I'm only 22, but I've been smoking since the night I turned 18. In the past 4 years, my body has taken hard hits. I'm not nearly in the same shape I was. I can't run for shit. I get out of breath by walking up a single flight of stairs, and that's absolutely unacceptable. To top it off, the looming threat of cancer has been giving me severe anxiety on a daily basis. I can't justify wasting my time, health, and money on something that I know *will* kill me someday. I'm smarter than that. We're all smarter than that.

So, I'm done. I can't do this anymore. For myself, for my love, and for my family, here it is: I am not a smoker.

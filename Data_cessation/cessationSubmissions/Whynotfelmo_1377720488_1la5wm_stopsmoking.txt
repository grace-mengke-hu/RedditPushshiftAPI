New here. Having trouble quitting

I can't seem to make it past even just 3 days. I'm about a pack a day or so smoker. Myself and my wife are both trying to quit and we find when we get bored is the worst because its all we can think about. Myself, I have trouble at work because almost everyone smokes and when it's time for a smoke break there is always someone to bum from. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated

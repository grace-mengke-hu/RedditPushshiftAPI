Mind wandering and can't stay on task

Haven't had nicotine in about 2 weeks.  Cravings are manageable, not having many issues other than concentration.  I can't seem to easily stay on task at work any more.  My mind wanders and I've been about 50% less productive.  I'm extremely happy with everything else quitting smoking has done for me but this one issue is very frustrating.  Anyone know how long this will last or is it a permanent thing?

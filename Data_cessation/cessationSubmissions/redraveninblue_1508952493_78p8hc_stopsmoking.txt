Needing some inspiration today.

Long story short: I’m going through some shit right now. A few different scenarios are causing me a tremendous amount of stress, one of which is that my car is slowly draining the battery while is sits. So, I had to have a coworker bring me to work today. She mentioned that she only had a few cigs and couldn’t afford more right now, so I offered to buy her a pack as a thank for you for helping me. I’m not gonna lie, I really really wanted to buy myself a pack. I thought of about a dozen justifications for it. But for some reason, I didn’t do it. However, I now can’t stop thinking about it today. All I want to do is buy a pack of cigarettes. I keep telling myself it’s not worth it, I know I can’t smoke just one, I’m not going to like it anyway, it’s a waste of money and health, etc etc. But I still want to. I’m kind of at a loss right now and any words of encouragement or advice are greatly appreciated!!!

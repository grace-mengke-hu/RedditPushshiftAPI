Feeling ashamed

My last cigarette was at 6:00 A.M. on August 18, 2013. I had been smoking for 11 years and the last 5 of which had turned into a pack-per-day (or more) addiction.


I was 2 days away from making 6 months with ZERO nicotine. No gum, patches, e-cigs, or dip. I had the most intense craving for a smoke that I just couldn't shake on my way home. I stopped at the corner store and bought a pack of my old favorites and chain smoked the entire thing in 3 hours.


I'm ashamed because I thought after the first 2 drags that I'd be so disgusted I'd throw them all out, but to my surprise, I enjoyed it.


All 20 of them.


Now I'm starting over.

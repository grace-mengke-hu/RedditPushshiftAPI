Did not expect this on day 8

I read Allen Carr's book this time around, and man did it make a huge difference. he successfully destroyed all the lies my nicotine addicted brain tells itself to convince me I want to smoke.

I made it through the first week with hardly any trouble. I even hung out with all of my smoking buddies, drank beer, did a lot of the things that made me relapse before without so much as a thought about wanting to smoke.

Then, yesterday, which was my IRL cake day, and the 7th being smoke free, at around 9pm, I felt like I hit a brick wall. I hardly had the energy to talk to my girlfriend, I was facing a cloud of extreme negativity and trying my best to mindfully let it pass, but all I could muster the strength to do was lay on my bed with my eyes covered giving my girlfriend one sentence answers to her questions of "what's wrong?" "are you mad at me?", etc.

It came out of nowhere - after a great day of canoeing, and enjoying a nice dinner. 

I expected to wake up this morning and that it would be gone, but it's not gone. I feel lethargic, agitated, self-loathing, and a dull sort of emptiness. I don't know if it's some weird quarter of a century blues (just turned 25), or if maybe I am confronting issues I smoked in order to suppress?

Smoking is NOT an option, and I am not worried about relapsing this time. I just wish I knew why I feel this way.

Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

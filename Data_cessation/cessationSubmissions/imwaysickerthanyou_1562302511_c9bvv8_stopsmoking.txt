3 Days Left, Then I'm Done

Decided about 2 weeks ago I'm 100% over this habit. Unfortunately I'm in a very hard summer class and studying for a final on Monday morning while also going though withdrawals was not a good idea. I'm honestly so god damn excited. I'm so sick of the spending money and freaking out about always having nicotine on me whenever i go places. I used to be a heavy cigarette smoker and tobacco/weed combo user and I successfully quit marijuana just a couple weeks ago. Time to let this one go too. I'm honestly upset I have to wait a couple more days. 

Reading through posts here has always been so inspiring, and I finally worked up the courage to quit after about a year of wanting to do so. I'll be posting/commenting on here a lot more for sure, as I know helping others is always such a good way to help yourself. I got this, and for anybody reading this wanting to quit, you do too. 

Bless you all.

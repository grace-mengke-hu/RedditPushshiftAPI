What do you spend your money on instead of cigarettes ?

Do you save up for something big? Or do you spend on something nice for yourself from time to time ?

My main motivation is to save money from not smoking and I haven't yet decided do I want to try and save for a longer time and do something nice with it or is it smarter to treat myself often ? 

Anyway I would love to know how you do it :)

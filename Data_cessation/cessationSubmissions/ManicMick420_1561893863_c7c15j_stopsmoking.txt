Independence Day... I have an Idea.

Greetings quitters! I have an Idea. Let us all quit by July 4th. We can declare ourselves independent from this addiction once and for all. I plan on quitting tomorrow to afford some things I need. I looked at my cigarette costs here in Philadelphia. $11.20 a pack. If you go out of the city it is 8 and change. Still 8 dollars for a pack FUCK YOU! After a few days that is a night of debauchery at ye old local pub, dinner with the spouse, or even the electric bill. Whatever it maybe I hope for the best for you all to quit! - Mick

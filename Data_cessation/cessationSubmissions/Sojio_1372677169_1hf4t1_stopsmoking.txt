Ecigs for 2 months. Drunkenly attempted a taylor - instantly nauseas. Is this a good sign?

So i've been using ecigs to slowly kill the habit. I was out last weekend and was pretty plastered. I was offered a cigarette and when i went to inhale it made me wretch. 

Is this a sign that i'm kicking the habit, or something else? I reminded me of when i first tried cigarettes.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments guys! Just to clarify i pretty much just had one puff and stubbed it out. Thanks for the support.

Skins cleared, no more drowsyness. Gained some weight and got some motivation back!

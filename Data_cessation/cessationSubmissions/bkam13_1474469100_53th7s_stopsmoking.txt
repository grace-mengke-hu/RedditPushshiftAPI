Day 3, mixed feelings

Hey guys, so I am on Day 3 of not smoking. I am still feeling a bit sick, but I have already had some positive effects. I went to the doctor this morning for my feeling sick.

I am coughing so much that I'm becoming hoarse, my chest hurts, and I have coughed enough that I felt like I was going to vomit. I've woken up several times over the past few nights hacking up a lung. I went to the doctor and he said I have an Upper Respiratory infection (likely bronchitis). So a round of antibiotics for me it is! Hopefully I will feel better soon.

However, on a positive note, I already feel like my head is clearer. I don't have as short of a fuse as I thought I would. My head no longer hurts, blood pressure is normal. I've already saved $10 according to QuitNow! I no longer repulse myself with my smell, and best of all I can breathe again!

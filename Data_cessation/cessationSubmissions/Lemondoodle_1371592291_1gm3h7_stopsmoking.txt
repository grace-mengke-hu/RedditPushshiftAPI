You can quit while under stress. Believe me, I know.

Since I quit smoking, here is the list of stressful events I've gotten through without smoking:

* My dad had a heart attack and almost died.
* My sisters house burned completely to the ground and she and her family lost everything.  
* A very close friend got brain cancer and died.
* My grandma had a stroke (she's doing ok).
* My ex got in trouble and lost custody of the kids forcing me to move to a very expensive area so my kids don't get kicked out of the district.
* My BF who I have lived with for 7 years, broke up with me when I told him I had to move for my kids.  He still smokes.  Is mad that I quit, and since I'm the breadwinner, is being forced to support himself. (yeah, i know, it happens unexpectedly sometimes).

But I haven't smoked at all.  I feel tired a lot and slightly depressed, but I know everything will work out.  Being a single parent will be a challenge too, I'm sure, but I won't be a single SMOKING parent.

Cheers!

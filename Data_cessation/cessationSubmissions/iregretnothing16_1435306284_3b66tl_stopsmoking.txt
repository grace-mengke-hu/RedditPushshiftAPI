Day 1, here we go!

As of last night, I smoked my last cigarette. I can't take not feeling healthy and constantly being nagged to quit. I feel bad all the time, worrying if I smell like smoke around my friends. I don't want to be a walking ashtray anymore, I'm ready to become a better and healthier version of me!
I've tried to quit twice already. I smoked for 3 years, and quit for 2 years, but picked it back up when I became depressed. I smoked for about 4 months, and decided I wanted to try and quit again, I didn't need to smoke anymore, things were starting to look up for me again. That lasted about a month, and now I've currently been smoking for a little over a year. I'm to the point where I'm ashamed to be smoking around my colleagues and friends. That is until I found this sub and I found the courage in me to finally quit, and hopefully quit for good. I want to be proud of who I am, not ashamed. I'm losing nothing but negativity by quitting, and I'm gaining so much by taking this one step! 
I've been on this sub for a few months now, reading all of your tips and advice on how to quit, and seeing what quitting has done for you and how supportive you all are of each other. You all have motivated me and inspired me to quit. I'm done buying cigarettes as of today.
Wish me luck, Reddit, hopefully the third time is the charm!

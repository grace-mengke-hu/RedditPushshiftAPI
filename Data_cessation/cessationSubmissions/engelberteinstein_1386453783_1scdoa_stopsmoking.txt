Why quit? Why continue...

I am in my mid thirties and didn't start smoking till I was 18. I have never, ever, been over half a pack a day, and that is only on really hard party weekends. I have smoked american spirits since the late 90's and for the last 10 years or so have been down to less than 3 a day. For a few years it was 1, and for a few months I quit during the week altogether (smoking while drinking is hard to pass up). Fast forward to the last 2 years and I'm in grad school. I had a ton of stress, including my qualifying exam (I passed), but the result is I'm now up to 3-4 a day. Most people think this is nothing, and wonder why I even care because it is so few. But any more than 1-2 and I wake up the next morning feeling gross. I can tell that my sense of taste is diminished, and I have started a running program, hoping to become a serious long distance runner. It is still so hard to quit. My blessing is also my curse- after a few days just having one sounds so small, but I end up right back where I am. I want so badly just to give it up for a few weeks, just to see if I feel better.

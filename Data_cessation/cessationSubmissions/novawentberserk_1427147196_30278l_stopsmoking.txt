Trying to make it through day five is always the hardest

This is my third quit attempt in a month. Its been like this 5 days-smoke, 22 days-smoke, 5 days-?. It's torture. If I fail this time its going to be awhile before I do this again. 

Day five has been the hardest each damn time. Its like on day five smoker's mentality comes back hard. I act like a smoker who just ran out of cigs and is digging through the couch cushions looking for change to buy more. 

The first time I wound up going to a vape shop and purchasing 0mg juice. When I got it home and finished vaping I noticed the label originally said 6mg but had been scratched out. So then I psyched myself into thinking I had had nicotine anyway, and I let myself slip for the night. 

And I'm right back there again. I just drove around town looking for herbal cigarettes... Like it was hour one of my withdrawals and I was feening. Couldn't find any so I used the 0mg ecig again and now I feel even worse. I'm doing the psych out thing to myself again. I've convinced myself that there was old nicotine in the compartment and that I've inhaled it. My brain feels squirrelly. I'm restless. I'm fidgety. I'm *this close* to saying fuck it. 

I feel like I'm going through the physical withdrawals now, rather than in the first three days. And I guess that's how strong my psychological withdrawals actually are, to be playing these mind games? But I feel like if I make it through today it'll definitely be smoother sailing like the last 22. But today is a bitch.

What is your single best advice you'd offer to a new quitter ?

Hi , 

Really glad to find this subreddit.

I'm 25y M, I've been smoking shisha-Hookah for the last 7 years, mostly twice a day but sometimes 3 times a day and today I decided to quit for good.

I've tried several times before, but deep inside i was not dead serious.

Smoking has affected my education, hobbies, family, my romantic life and my health.

I wanna do it for myself first, and for those around me ..

I would appreciate it if you offer me your single best advice you can give

I'll always update.


Wish me luck üëç

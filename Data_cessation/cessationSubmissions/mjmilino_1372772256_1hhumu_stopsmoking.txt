I smoked my last cigarette on the way to work; I'm now officially a non-smoker!

My name's Mike, and I'm a non-smoker.

I finished EasyWay this morning while getting ready for work and smoked my last cigarette on the way to the office. I'm now officially a non-smoker, killing that little beast inside me one minute at a time.

It's good to meet you all.

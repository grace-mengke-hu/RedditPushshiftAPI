5 days in and feel fucking pissed off

Honestly, I feel like it's pointless to try and stay quit as I feel down most days and smoking is pretty much the only relaxing part of my day.
I am always pretty much alone, i feel like i have no friends that care about me, my family is on the other side of the country, i feel no excitement for anything... what is the point to try and stay quit... i smoke 14-15 a day since i was a teenager, i am 33 now. 

I once quit for 3 years, picked it back up a few years ago- life just felt empty without it.

no clue what to do... feeling kinda like caving- but i have a cold so it's stoping me from doing that... I usually can quit for a week or 2 when i get a bad chest cold--- but once i am back feeling better i always go back.. 

anyway thanks for listening to me ramble- feeling stressed the FUCK out.

21 days.

I sit here and still wonder how I got this far.  It's been 21 days since I began this journey.  20 of them completely nicotine free. (I slipped momentarily on day 6) But all in all I have done what I set out to do.  I have been able to do this with the help of Chantix and copious amounts of marijuana.
It hasn't been easy,  even with the help of the prescriptions,  but it was something a complete stranger from this sub said that has kept me going.  
They said "Quitting is easier than chemo." I know that person could not have known, but it was the scare of cancer that drove me to quit to begin with.  
Along the way there have been hiccups.  The first week was by far the hardest.  It was about Day 7 the physical craving pretty much stopped for me.  After that it was,  and is,  all in my head. 
I find myself having the most difficulty when I'm doing things I normally did while smoking (coffee,  phone conversations,  after completing almost any task) It's weird, but for a nano second I always forget, and think I'm going to go smoke,  and then I quickly remember.. Ohh yea,  I don't smoke. 
Physically what I have noticed the most is how much easier and deeper my breaths are.  I still have a bit of a cough in the morning,  but as a whole my lung function has improved tremendously.  I can smell and taste so much better.  The icky coating that was always on my tongue is gone which has made foods so much more appealing. 
I think over all what I've gained in this has been strength.  I feel so strong in this quit. 
 6 months ago if you'd have told me I would quit smoking the first time and be sitting here reflecting 3 weeks into it,  I'd have laughed.  Now when I think of quitting I think about it in terms of forever and I anticipate being able to come again and share my 3 year reflection. 
Being a non smoker is Incredible and it is a title I wear very proudly.

It's Time!

Tomorrow my fiance and puppy are going on a 4 day backpacking trip. We are both smokers who have been smoking for about 12 years. One of the issues we face is that we fight really, really bad when we try to quit and end up both caving and buying cigarettes. Tomorrow, he is leaving and not bringing any cigarettes with him. Tonight before I sleep, I will have my last cigarette. 

I'm quitting because:
1. It's expensive and we are trying to pay off debt and save for a house.
2. We both love biking and hiking. Smoking makes exercise difficult.
3. We want to have children someday soon and we know the risks associated with pregnancy and smoking. We also don't want our children to ever see us smoke because children of smokers are more likely to become smokers themselves.
4. I don't want any of the horrid health issues associated with smoking.

I'm really scared though. Any advice to get through the cravings? How long do the withdrawal symptoms usually last?

I want to stop

I want to feel relaxed. I want to feel clean. I want to have more taste.

I am depressed for a couple of reasons and I have heard that smoking cessation is really good if you are.

I'm writing this to make it official to myself.

I do yoga almost every day. I meditate every day.

I do nofap and stopped smoking pot, drinking alcohol and other drugs. 

This is just the next logical step down the line.

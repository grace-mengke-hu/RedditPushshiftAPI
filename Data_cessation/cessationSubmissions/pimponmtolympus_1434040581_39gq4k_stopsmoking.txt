Big day today

So today at work I cut off the tip of my finger and had to be sent to emergency care, which sucks. But I fill out all the paperwork and they stick me in a room to do vitals and whatnot. Now one of the standard questions is "do you smoke?" and today I got to say no. 3 months smoke free and I couldn't be happier, even though I'm missing part of my finger

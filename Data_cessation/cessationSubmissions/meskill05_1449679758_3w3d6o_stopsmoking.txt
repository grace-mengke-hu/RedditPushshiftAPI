Whew!! Made it to day 50!!

Whoohooo made it to day 50!! Just checking in, besides the past ups and downs, week before last, I can honestly say, that it is getting easier!   Didn't think I would say that, but it is. I still have the times where I crave pretty bad, but not as much as before and not as intense as beofre., I swear, if it wasn't for the few here (I believe you know who you are) that have been here for me every step of the way,with your words of advice and encouragement, and helping me thru the bad times, where I wanted to smoke so bad, I don't think I would have made it to day 50!! , I thank you for that, and I thank you in advance for the help with the NEXT 50 days!!! ;) hopefully I won't put you through to much trouble!! ðŸ˜†

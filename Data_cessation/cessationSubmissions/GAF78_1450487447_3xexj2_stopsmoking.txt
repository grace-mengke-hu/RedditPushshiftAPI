Cravings today

It's day 7 or 8, I'm not sure. Maybe day 9. Anyway I haven't had many cravings until today. Today I really wanted to smoke. 

I went to a friends house last night and we normally stand outside and smoke together. I told her I wasn't smoking and she asked me to stand out there with her, which I did. I chewed some gum. It wasn't bad. Then today when I was finishing up work for the afternoon it hit me hard. I'm hanging in there. This is the first weekend I will have without my kids since I quit. They're at their dad's until Sunday night. I'm also taking a 4 hour road trip to visit my parents tomorrow and will stay overnight. I usually sit outside and smoke with my dad. It's kind of our thing. He smokes a pipe. Anyway, just some challenges today and this weekend. Hope everyone else is doing well.

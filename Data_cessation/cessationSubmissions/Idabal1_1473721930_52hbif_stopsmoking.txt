Two weeks now and a new life

I quit two weeks ago. From the moment I quit I made some changes in my daily routines. I joined a gym. I started to practice some exercise and I decided to start a healthy diet. Today after two weeks I feel full of energy. Exercise is easier for me since I breath much better. And with my healthy diet I even lost some pounds. My skin looks much better. In fact one of the presents I am going to give me myself with all the money I saved is a relaxing facial massage. 
My teeth look more white. Life is much better. Yes I had cravings and I slowly breath drink water eat an apple, or just stand up and go for a walk and I fouls in some other things that make my head not to think about cig. Sometimes I just come here and rad some post. So thank you everybody for helping, for sharing, and for making me feel I am not alone in my personal fight.

tobbacco+pot smoker stopped smoking +tips for artists/musicians

   So here in the old world we smoke a lot of hash with a lot of tobacco, with handmade CARTON filters.Every kind of shit comes in.I used to smoke 2 to 5 hashbacco joints a day, but my wet ronking cough was a cry of help from my body to my needy mind.Nevermind those cilindrical loadings of death anymore!

10 days going, and feeling great!Cough has almost subsised, I don't know if i was addicted to one or both, but I don't care, i don't need them or alcohol to improvise and create.

Tips:

Circle-Get that instrument going!If you're a freesinger like me pick up the guitar or an instrument and focus on it and singing while everyone is puffing,if you're a player pick up singing even if talking. but i would recommend getting off the hardcore social circles and find new ones for a while.It will also help creativity to meet new artists to mix your own color with!

Circle-You don't need drugs to flow, not even women(but you can't quit everything :P)

Dot-Put the awareness in your music like a master of meditations, just watch what your mouth and hand drible without judgements.
    
Dot-write your sadness,draw your happiness, eat your friends and meet new ones, play a sport, play with a pencil in your hands,make sculptures,do illegal neo-cave art, learn hand coin tricks,go for a walk in the forest and scream and shout and let it all out. Everything to keep those fingering hands and mind occupied.

Whish me luck, I wish you yours!

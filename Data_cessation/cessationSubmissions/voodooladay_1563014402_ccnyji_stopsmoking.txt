One year cigarette free!

Thank you to this community and all of the people in it who have taken the time to share their experiences and offer supporting words of encouragement to others who were trying to quit. A year ago, I was on my third or fourth serious attempt at quitting after almost 19 years of smoking. I had stumbled a few times leading up to that point but I knew I wanted to be a nonsmoker so I figured I’d try again. I woke up, smoked my last cigarette, and here we are a year later. It feels good. It hasn’t always been easy but I guess that’s true for most things that are worth doing. I spent a lot of time reading about the experiences of others and I started (but never finished) Alan Carr’s book a few weeks in to my quit. If you are just starting out, believe me when I say it does get easier with time and that it’s worth hanging in there on the tough days. Quitting is not something to do on your own - thank you to all of the people out there who inspired me to stay nicotine free without even realizing it.

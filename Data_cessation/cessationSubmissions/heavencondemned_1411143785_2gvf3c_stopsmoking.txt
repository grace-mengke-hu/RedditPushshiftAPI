I went six hours without a cigarette today and it wants bad.

I had to go without today because of the iPhone 6 release. It's been a crazy morning, and I don't know if it's because I was too busy to think about smoking, but it wasn't so bad at all. Maybe I can quit now. Short post about a small glimmer of hope. Good luck to you all.

Another "be wary" posts

Good-bye smiling star flair! I will miss you greatly, and will see you again soon (in 364 days).

I was a successful ex-smoker for ~680 days or so. I conquered backpacking through Europe (everyone smokes), a job change/going back to graduate school, long distance drives (and a long distance relationship at once point), I ran a marathon, several half marathons, and was generally so so happy.

But my GF and I have hit a low point in our relationship. We are taking some time to be more comfortable with ourselves and our own life decisions. It is tough to not be living together after having been for more than a year. And I fell off the wagon (on the wagon?) quickly. 

I pitied my self for a few days, fell back into the old nasty habit. But cleaning it back up. Here's to cold water ALWAYS in my water bottle, deep breathing exercises and knowing that those cravings pass. Just fight through em!

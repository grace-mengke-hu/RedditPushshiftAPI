Depression getting worse after a week

So I had my last cigarette 9/26. Used the patch and gum for a week stopping 10/4. The first week was surprisingly easy but it has been getting worse and worse . I thought it was supposed to get better not worse. I feel like I'm going crazy. Crying non stop , deeply deeply depressed. Anyone else feel like this after two weeks Smoke free?

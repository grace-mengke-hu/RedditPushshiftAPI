slipped up

Hey guys.

So see that 4 week badge next to my name? As of a minute ago, nope. Tonight after work I bought myself a pack of Marlboro Reds and just smoked one. I'm not proud of myself, but I'm not really ashamed or beating myself up about it. I am not really sure how I feel honestly. Mixed feelings. 

One cigarette in four weeks is a vast improvement for me, so I am trying to look at it that way. These four weeks I have learned that I don't NEED cigarettes, that I can start my day without one, get through a work shift without one, and go to sleep without one. I can get stressed out and work through it and not need to smoke in order to cope. It hasn't been easy, and I still crave them a lot, but usually (until tonight) I can get through it. If I can get through four weeks without one, I can keep at it despite slipping up.

I know I should probably throw the pack in my sink but part of me doesn't want to. Maybe I'll give them to a coworker tomorrow, or something, I don't know.

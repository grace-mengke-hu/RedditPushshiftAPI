I keep having dreams about smoking...

And waking up feeling so disappointed in myself. 
I had to quit nicotine cold turkey because I had to have a surgery that required skins grafts. 
I've now reached the point where the grafts are completely healed, which means technically I could start smoking again
Obviously I don't WANT to, but I think my subconscious is toying with the idea while I'm asleep.

PLEASE HELP! 5 days and I'm about to cave in and smoke

I can't take it anymore. I quit going cold turkey and I am so close to saying just fuck it because this feeling is unbearable. Yesterday (day 4) was quite a bit easier. I don't know why I feel like this.

My resting heart rate has gone from 110 bpm all the way down to 75 bpm since I quit. I can breathe so much more easily. My wheezing has gone away. I was needing my inhaler every 4 hours before quitting, and I haven't used it once since I quit. When I lay down to go to sleep, I'm no longer wheezing terribly and having trouble breathing. I've saved a little over $50 since quitting.

WHYYYYYY do I want a cigarette so bad with all of these benefits? I want one so badly, I can practically feel that throat hit and smoke filling up my lungs. And if I'm not feeling like that, I am crying for no reason or losing my temper worse than a 2 year old. 

If anyone is willing to give some words of wisdom or help talk me off a ledge so I don't smoke, please help. This is my first post in this sub after lurking here for a couple of years. I don't know if it's against the rules, but if someone could DM me or point me towards a chatroom that is mobile-friendly, that would be awesome. Sorry for all the rambling.

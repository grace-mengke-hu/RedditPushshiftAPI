At-work smoker

I cannot stop smoking at work. I can go a weekend at home without so much as a thought of having a cigarette. I even took a two week vacation and didn't light up till the first Monday back. I don't want to smoke. As I'm sure everyone experiences this: every single thing at work is a trigger. I want to quit. What can I do?

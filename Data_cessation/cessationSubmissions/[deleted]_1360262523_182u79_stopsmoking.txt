Two things no one tells you before you quit smoking..

I have been off cigarettes (pack a day 16 years) for 5 weeks now. It has been the best decision I have ever made. But here are two things no one tells you before you quit..

1) You have to learn how to speak again.
Around week four, my mouth started to produce loads more saliva. I think all the saliva glands in my mouth are coming back to life and as a result, making loads of saliva. No more dry mouth for me.

However, this has led me to accidentally spit/spray more when talking. When I was doing a presentation in front of 20 people at work the other day, I was spitting all over the place when I was talking. I had to keep swallowing more than I used to. 

I'm used to speaking with a smoky dry mouth so it'll just take practice to getting used to having so much saliva again.

2) This one is for the male readers. Has anyone noticed that you produce more semen when you've stopped smoking? My wife has said that my semen levels have increased since I quit and that my erections are a lot more, ahem, firm.. I haven't noticed but she says they have.

I don't know if these are good or bad side-effects of having quit smoking.

C. Everett Koop, Ex-Surgeon General, Dies at 96

In 1989 he said (and I'm paraphrasing), that if tobacco was a new discovery and made into cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, rolling tobacco, it would be outlawed and treated the same as toxic waste such was the harm it does to the human body.

Edit: clarifying, of course tobacco was discovered, what he was saying was that if tobacco was a recent discovery circa 1980s.

Having a tough night

So tuesday was my First day off smokes. It wasn’t fun but it worked. Now it’s thursday evening, and I’m having a night to myself for the first time in forever. Having some nice food and drinks, and things were awesome until I started craving cigarettes. Do you guys have any tips for this?

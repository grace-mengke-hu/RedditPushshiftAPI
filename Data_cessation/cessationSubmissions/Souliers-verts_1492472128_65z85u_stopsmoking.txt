"Accidentally" stopped, need advice for the coming days :)

Hi everyone. I went to a concert with a friend a few days ago, ended up running out of cigarettes there. Anyways, long story short, I woke up the next day sick with a sore throat and feeling dead from having 4 hours of sleep. After I got back to my place I ended up sleeping most of the day, then felt too sick to leave the house all day the next. Since I was sick, tired, and cigarette-less and I've been wanting to quit for awhile, now seemed like a good time to bite the bullet and do it.

Anyways, it's been about 48 hours since I last smoked. I've mostly just had a headache so far, but I've also been sick so I haven't really been thinking about the fact that I'm craving a cigarette. Bit concerned about when this cold goes away and I can't focus on that anymore..

Is it true that withdrawals peak around 72 hours?
Do you have any tips for what to do when I have cravings but aren't feeling to sick to get off the couch? Any good ways to handle them?

Thanks

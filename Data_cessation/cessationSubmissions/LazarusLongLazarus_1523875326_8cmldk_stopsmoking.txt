Another newbie and day 1er

Just went past 24 hours! It’s insanely hard!

I’m 30 and have smoked since 15, around 25 a day since 20. I have tried to quit a million times before but always came back. I’m going cold turkey this time with only this group to help. I strangely feel more confident than ever this time after lurking here and reading all the great advise and personal stories.

The withdrawals are crazy though, one minute your fine then the next your fighting the four horsemen of the apocalypse. An internal fight for the future of humanity! Ok maybe a bit much but at the time it does feel like that.

It’s good to know that the worst of it passes after a few days.

Anyway... onwards and upwards! Come at me day 2!

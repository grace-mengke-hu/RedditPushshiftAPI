My main reason for addiction is anxiety and needing something to do with my hands - advice?

Cigs are less of a problem as it's a rare thing for me. Not sure if it's the right sub for this - but it's vaping that gets me.

I can vape at my desk at work, so I just sit there puffing away then do the same at home. It's worse if i'm at a bar with a group of people because I feel a constant need to do it, and a big part is I need a distraction and like I said in the title, something to occupy my hands when i'm in conversation as i'm fairly introverted and get a little anxious when i'm in large groups especially for long periods of time.

Obviously the kick of nicotine/vape is a big thing, but i'm worried about the amount i'm putting in myself. Is 0mg vape liquid a healthy option or is there some method that people use to distract themselves i'm not sure about that works?

10 days

It has been 10 days into my quit now. I still think about cigarettes often, especially when triggers occur, but there are little glimmers of hope for what it is like to be a non-smoker. One thing that surprised me recently was going a few hours without thinking of cigarettes at all. It was like they didn't even exist. It may not sound like much, but this was a truly amazing experience for me.

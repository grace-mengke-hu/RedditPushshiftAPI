Oral fixation/what to do with your hands?

First, I'm currently vaping crappy gas station e cigs so I apologize that I'm not in the "correct" forum but there is so much more support here. I quit smoking cigarettes for over a year and never had the desire to smoke one even after a heavy night of drinking. I picked nicotine back up about 3 months ago when I stopped taking benzos and felt stressed at work. I know that the stimulants aren't helping my recovery. But even though I'm not smoking per se, the nicotine has grabbed a hold of me. I can't drive without sucking on this e cig the whole time, and it's like the old habit of having something in my mouth/hands is back in full force. What have you guys had success with to keep your hands/mind busy when you're automated towards reaching for that cig, vape, whatever?

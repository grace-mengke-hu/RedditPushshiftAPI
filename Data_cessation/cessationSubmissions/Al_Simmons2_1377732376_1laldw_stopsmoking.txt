Day 3 and I feel "aite".

I quit about 3.5 days ago. Last cig I had was on Monday around 2-3pm. It's now Thursday and I feel pretty good not smoking. I've been smashing down the nicotine gum now, and I feel it's a habit. Though for the past 6 months I've been on/off nicotine gum and I have cut down cigs dramatically (3-5 a day). I even drank alcohol last night, and didn't feel like smoking (we all know what drinking and smoking is like. Ebony and ivory).

I go to the gym daily for some cardio work, and I usually practice weights at home. Trying to get in shape too.

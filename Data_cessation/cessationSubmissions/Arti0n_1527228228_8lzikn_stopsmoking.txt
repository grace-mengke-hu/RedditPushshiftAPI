I made it through the first day!

Hey guys, first of all I'm glad I found out about this sub! I think it really did help me with the decision to stop smoking.

I would like to tell you about my first smoke free day. It's really weird because I thought it would be a lot harder. At the beginning of this week I thought I just start smoking less before I quit for good, I really struggled and craved for cigarettes a lot.

This Wednesday evening I made the decision and said to myself, I'm a non smoker, I don't want to smoke I loose nothing if I quit but gain so much.

I've read that the first three days are the hardest, but I was surprised how easy it felt for me. Okay I'm only half way through my second day, but I feel good and confident I don't really struggle at the moment. The cravings are not as hard as I thought, it's like something clicked in my head.. Did anyone experience something similar? (I don't mean to offend anyone who struggles harder, I wish you good luck, you can do it)

3 days down and this is the furthest I've ever gotten...

but I feel like my brain is in a war against itself! I keep rationalizing why it's okay to smoke and then I realize what I'm doing. I feel like I'm both the little devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other.

I have tried to quit countless times and I've always given into the addiction really early on. I am DETERMINED to quit this time. Today is just really tough, I'm honestly kind of scared to leave my house because I think I'll cave if I do.

Any advice on dealing with the first few days would be amazing. Thanks for reading.

100 days and a close call Saturday night

It's been 100 days since I last smoked a cigarette - after YEARS of repeatedly trying to quit and failing every two or three weeks. So, I'm celebrating that fact and also feeling relieved that I didn't give in to a craving I had this weekend. 

99.9% of the time I have no desire to smoke anymore, but this weekend I went to a party and went into the 'smoking room' of the house to smoke a (tobacco-free) joint, but was also exposed to a lot of second hand cig smoke. I didn't want a cigarette at the time, but then, about an hour later, it was all I could think about. I suspect it was the nicotine from the second hand smoke wearing off and my body instantly wanted more. It was a good reminder of how insidious and instantly addictive nicotine is and why 'not one puff ever' and avoiding second hand smoke is the only way to go. I could hear the nicotine-junky, brainwashed self-manipulation starting to happen in my mind (e.g. if I just smoked one cig right now, no one would know and it wouldn't be a big deal...) What got me through was thinking about my commitment to stay cigarette free for one full year (obviously for the rest of time, too, but I'm just really looking forward to being able to say I've been a non-smoker for a whole year). The power of the badge saves the day! 

Congrats to all my fellow NYE quitters and best of luck to those lurking and thinking of quitting. It gets unimaginably easier once you're free of the addiction - you can do it and you'll never regret it!

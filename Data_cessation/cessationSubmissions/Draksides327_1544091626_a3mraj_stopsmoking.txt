I have been nicotine free for over 1 month

So I have started smoking in eight grade. Fast forward to today(3 years later) where I stopped active smoking year ago and stopped vaping month ago. And actually life is good. I don't miss it and when ain't around smokers or vapers I don't even think about it.

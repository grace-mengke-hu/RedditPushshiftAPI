24 hours...

I went to my hypnotist yesterday. About six years ago, he helped me to quit and I did so for several years. Lapsed again badly, but it's time to give the cigarettes away forever.

It's been 24 hours since my first session (he does three, to reinforce the message) and I've had no withdrawal symptoms. There have been a couple of moments where I "knew" I was supposed to be doing something -- until I realised what that was... lol.

Part of me will probably always miss what nostalgia tells me is the "comfort" side of smoking. However, I know the reality. I wish I had never lapsed after my last quit. There is no "comfort" side; just increasingly bad health.

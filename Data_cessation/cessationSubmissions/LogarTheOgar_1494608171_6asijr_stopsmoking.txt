There is only one way to quit smoking

The only way to quit smoking is to not smoke.

It's not that you can't quit smoking, it's that you want to quit but you keep smoking anyway.

I'm trying to do two things: quit smoking and lose weight. Just about 15lbs. Eating smaller meals more frequently, less crap food, more vegetables. (Breakfast, 11-sies, Lunch, Afternoon snack, Dinner, Supper)

What I've been doing is whenever my willpower wanes to a point where I feel I need a break, I divulge a little hard into food. It satisfies the "I need something," and it's an "allowable" crack because it's not smoking a cigarette.

The most important thing to me is stopping smoking, so I have the energy to work out and basically just go crush life. Working out, even just 30 minutes a day, helps immensely with pumping my body full of feel-good chemicals that I never really thought existed. And that workout usually burns off whatever food I decided to indulge in.

It's hard, but it gets way easier.
I feel great and confident.

Whenever I want a cigarette, because I'm bored, I remind myself I'm just bored, and that I want to quit smoking, so it would be silly to smoke at all.

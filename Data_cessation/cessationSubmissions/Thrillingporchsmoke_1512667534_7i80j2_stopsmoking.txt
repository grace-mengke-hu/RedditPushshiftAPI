I quit smoking for 9 months using Snus (a Swedish smokeless tobacco). It’s not perfect—Snus has nicotine and is carcinogenic—but I have no taste or craving for cigarettes anymore.

Even when I tried to smoke after months of not having any, it wasn’t the same. I could finally taste the cigarette and it, to my surprise, tasted like shit.

Day 1... So Bored

I quit (again) today. 

I tried last weekend, but slipped. 

I'm reading Allen Carr's book or trying to do something when the cravings hit, but I'm so bored, and my head hurts, and I'm kind of shaky... Ugh. 

If I give in now, I'll only feel worse later. Cognitive dissonance brings nothing but suffering. 

Has anyone set up a reinforcement schedule for themselves (ex. If I go X days without smoking, then I will Y)?

Anyone have less urges to smoke as they get older?

I am 41 years old and I have been smoking since I was in high school. In my earlier years I smoked one to two packs a day and gradually over the years I was down to 1 - 4 cigs a day. For some reason is the last few months my urge to smoke has been going down. I barely smoke a half a cig now and many times forget all together to smoke at all. It's weird but my urge to smoke all of a sudden has practically gone away and I am not even trying. Anyone else experience this as they get older?

3½ Days - Feels better than my previous attempts to quit

Hi, 
iv'e been a smoker for 9 years (I am 26 years old, started when i was about 17).

Tried to quit 5 years ago, after reading that Allen Carr book.
Iv'e lasted for 2 days - and failed.
Ever since this failure, i realized that i'm an addict.

I also started to smoke weed 5 years ago, and it is very common in my country to mix weed with tobacco, so iv'e made a choice, and "Quitted" again. I told myself that i would smoke only weed from now on.

But i was fooling myself. It was a nightmare that lasted 8 months. I got addicted to smoking weed because i used to mix it with tobacco. Everyone praised me, but only I knew I was a fraud.
So i was back to smoking cigarettes.

A month ago i decided to quit again. I got the "Smoke Free" app (That's how i found this subreddit), 
But i was fooling myself again because of my weed+nicotine smoking, so again i failed.

3½ Days Ago i finally decided - No tobacco ever again!!!
I was never been so determined in all my years of smoking.  And it's going pretty easy so far (Maybe because of the last month where i drastically decreased my usual nicotine levels).

As for the weed, i smoke it clean now, or with "greengo" natural mixture (100% Tobacco free), and not nearly in the same frequency that i used to :)

This stopsmoking sub really helps alot! you are doing a holy work here guys! very supportive indeed.

Thank You,
I'll be back :)

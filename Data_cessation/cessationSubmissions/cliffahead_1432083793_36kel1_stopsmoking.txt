old quitter here. Day 3 and counting.. slowly.

Hey all, i figured there'll be a sub for this struggle that so many of us face.

i'm 31, and i've been a smoker for 15 years. today is the umpteen time i've tried quitting, but this time, i believe i can do it. Day 3 in, and short of strangling my boss, my subordinates, and everyone around me, i think i'm doing good?

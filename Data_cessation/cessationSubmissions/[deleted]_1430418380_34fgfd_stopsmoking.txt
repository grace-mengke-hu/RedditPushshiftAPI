Need some encouragement.

So according to my app is been 29 hours since my last cigarette. All day at work I haven't been able to concentrate, my subconscious is trying to find ways I can justify going and buying another pack. I feel jittery and like I'm missing something.  Just need some encouragement to get through the rest of this day and the weekend coming up.  I Appreciate all of yalls posts, hopefully I can be as strong as a lot of you on here!

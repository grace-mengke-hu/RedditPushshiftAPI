4 WEEKS AS AN EX-SMOKER : List of things that have worked for me.

1. Working in a school where cigarettes are not even alowed on campus.

2. Daily meditation sessions (morning and evening).  Mindfulness is the ðŸ”‘.  Be aware and be gentle.

3. Running;  seeing the improvements in my pace and how I feel has been a great motivator.  Of course I have been a runner for years so I am able to compare before and after.

4.  Toothpicks!!!  Calms the cravings imediatly and for some reason I even feel cool walking around with one in my mouth.  May be the Texan in me. Lol

5. If you "smoke out", limit it.  Switch to higher grade and use a chillum... Mimics the physical of smoking yet limits intake.  

6. The SMOKE OUT app.  Daily missions and data keeps me inspired

7.  Suckers, gum, and ðŸŒ»seeds.  

8. Not taking myself so seriously at work or in my personal life.  Let shit go and forgive people for being human and flawed.  Also, forgive yourself.

9.  Having a plan for every scenario and acknowledging my weakness.

10. Telling people and keeping them updated

11. Cleaning and organizing my life and home; using the time that I have gained from not smoking to make improvements or be productive.

12. A supportive group of family and friends.

13. Being aware of the money saved.

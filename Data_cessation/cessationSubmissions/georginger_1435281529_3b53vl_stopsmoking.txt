I fell off the bandwagon...

I posted my 100 days success on here a while back, and the support I received was incredible. You guys truly rock.

Last month, I moved halfway across the country, and though I didn't feel particularly stressed about it, I picked up my old habit like I'd never quit in the first place. 
Probably as a way to deal with the stress that wasn't making itself known any other way. I went straight back to feeling lethargic, tired, and stopped exercising.

I just wanted to tell this awesome community that I'm back on the quit train, and this time, I know I've gotta do it for real. We've got this.

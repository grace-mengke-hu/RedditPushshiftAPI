Past the 24 hours nicotine free mark!

I'm feeling pretty good....okay I guess. I signed up for this text message service and an app that are helping me stay focused, I'm eating dum-dums when I get the oral cravings and doing a 5 minute interval workout to get through the bigger cravings that get. It's just funny how hard a craving can suddenly hit you and I know I'm not even at the worst yet. Just needed to let it out.

A couple questions too, does anyone else have nightmares when they are quitting? Mine are awful and really hurt my sleep, I feel like I've been in an irritated fog all day!

So it's been a year.

As proud of myself I am to have not have smoked in a year, I'm going to play the low card. Even though I was running 5 days a week up til 3 weeks ago, I'm still going to play the low card. As much as my health has improved, I again will still play the low card. 

The thing I've learned is that life keeps moving. There's always that chance that I make a mistake - in fact I'm certain that there are overwhelming  triggers i've not dealt with. Keeping this in mind I suppose helps keep me from those very mistakes. It's not the past that matters but the never ending journey. 

While some here shows overwhelming expressions of freedom from the choice to quit ( And dont get me wrong here, I enjoy them also! ), I don't want to give anyone false hopes of a gingerbread life. Stress still happens. bills still pile up, Money still goes down the drain, and it still gets cold at night. And that's probably the biggest point here, despite the benefits you may now enjoy that every non smoker has always enjoyed.

Yes. I'll play that low card. Because I don't know what's around the bend.

Idea: Mentoring new quitters!

So, I figured out I have over 500 days under my belt, and that it's not an issue any more. I thought of an idea: how about the long-running non smokers will mentor new quitters?

Comment in this thread if you'd like to be a mentor, or to get a mentor.


Noa, 31, Avialable for Mentoring :)

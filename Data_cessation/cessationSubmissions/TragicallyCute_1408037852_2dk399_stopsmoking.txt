How long after quitting until the urge to be a jerk goes away?

Every time my husband tries to quit smoking we come within inches of a divorce. Every single time. I've switched to vaping and so has he, but two weeks after his last cigarette he's still being a phenomenal jerk. We've fought more in the last two weeks than we have in the two years we've been together and it's gotten to the point where I can't talk to him about anything or he'll start screaming. 

How long is this going to last? Please, someone tell me it'll be over soon because I'm about to shove a cigarette down his throat just to make it stop - which means I'll have to go through this again next time he quits.

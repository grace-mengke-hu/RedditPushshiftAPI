Got drunk with smokers

*Sorry for my english, it's not my primary language*

It happened 2 times since I stopped smoking. I got drunk twice with some friends. We when out at a bar. There was a LOT of smokers. I even when outside with them, and they were smoking all night in front of me. I had my toothpicks in my pocket :D ! Never under estimate toothpicks, they are your friends. I always bring some with me, it really helps cause it keeps your mouth busy as if you were smoking. 

So what an accomplishement. You know it's over for good when your jugement is afffected but you still don't want to smoke. I'm so proud of me and every time I resist a temptation, I feel stronger and I feel like I  control my life compared to when Nicotine was controlling it.

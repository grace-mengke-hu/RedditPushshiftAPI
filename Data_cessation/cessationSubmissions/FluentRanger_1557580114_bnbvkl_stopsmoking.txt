10 days since i quit smoking (cold turkey)

Hi everyone, how is everyone today
i am a new ex smoker(used to smoke 2 packs a day)

little history about me: i ve been smoking for 20 years and i am 29 years old; a very young age as you can see as i was a troubled stupid kid.

anyways around noon on may the 1st,  i woke up had a  first cigarette,  and i was talking to the gf (been with her for 4 years) at that time about random stuff (she doesn't smoke) i realized that she keeps her distance from me;

 it smells like garbage she said, it is been 4 years and i have never noticed that, was i blind all the time (probably)


so i quit

didn't tell her i quit, after few days she asked why u don't smoke near me anymore, i am sorry if i said it smells like garbage, i said: no i quit smoking

anyways i know the story is corny; 

but take my advice:
1) when u quit don't tell anyone in real life, just spend 3 days not talking about it to anyone even to ur self 

2) at 10 days i still want cigarette and i felt i will go run to the store  4 or 5 times a day to smoke, but i don't, it did get easier with time, however you need to understand that it isn't as horrible, scary or hard as you read about it

3) i never thought about quit smoking before, i would laugh at person if they ask me if i ever thought to quit smoking, because to tell you the truth i loved smoking

 so you too can quit smoking and you already thinking about it if you reading these words


P.s: if any lady reading this please to your men if you don't like his smell on top of you, i know we are stubborn and idiots (not all of us) but our brain works better if you tell us directly what you feel and want

thank you all for reading this and have a nice day/night

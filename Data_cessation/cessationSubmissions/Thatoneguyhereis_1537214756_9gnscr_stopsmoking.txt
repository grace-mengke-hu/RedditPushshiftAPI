Quitting smoking day 16 for the past week I have been feeling intense waves of Depression and anxiety

As the title states I have been feeling the moods and sometimes I feel really high highs were Iâ€™m happy as I could be. How long does this last? I kinda hate feeling like this being someone who got over a major depression over a year ago.

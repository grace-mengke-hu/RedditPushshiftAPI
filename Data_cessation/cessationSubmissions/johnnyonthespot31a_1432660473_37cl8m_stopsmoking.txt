30+ Days!

When I was first starting this quit, I would come here to look at my badge as it crept up slowly.  I would look at the posters who had 30 days on their badge and would think to myself, "Wow, I can't wait until I've got that amount of time under my belt!"  At the time I felt like it was SO FAR AWAY, but in looking back it's been relatively quick! 

For everyone out there looking at those that have longer badges for inspiration, just know that you are likely inspiring those with shorter badges to start/continue their own quits! 

Now I'm looking at those with 1 year badges, and I can't wait to get there myself!

Cheers everyone! We will not smoke today!

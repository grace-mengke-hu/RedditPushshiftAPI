303

I just popped in to see how you wonderful people are doing and saw that I've surpassed 300 days!

I just want to say a couple things to anybody who is struggling. The first is that it gets easier. Every day is easier than the last. Through the cravings and the emotions, the relapses and second guessing... It gets easier. It may not feel like it when you're in the thick of it, but I promise you, today is better than yesterday. The second: Don't give up on yourself. You are worth every second of the misery you are in right now.   


Day 1, day 10, day 300 or day 10000. We're all ex smokers. Welcome to the party.

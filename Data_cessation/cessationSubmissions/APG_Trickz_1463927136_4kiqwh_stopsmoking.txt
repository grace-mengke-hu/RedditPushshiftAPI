Tomorrow marks a week!

Tomorrow will be one week since my recent quit attempt, I'm feeling better than ever. Using the 'Step 1' Nicorette patches and working most days. Finding some skin irritation with the patches but nothing too bad, trying to change up the position of the patch each day. 

I'm feeling much better about this attempt than my previous attempts, my gym membership runs out soon and I'll definitely be renewing and actually using it! 

If anyone has any sanity tips for those moments where you feel like a little bomb about to explode around your loved ones - I'd love to hear them. 

To anyone who's quitting at the moment - good on you and keep at it. You've already done more than a lot of people will realise, and I admire every single one of you for what you're doing to improve your health and wellbeing! 

Keep at it, everyone!

PS: If anyone needs a little motivation buddy, flick me a PM and we can chat and I'll do what I can to help keep you motivated to do the best you can!

I didn't have a smoke for 8 hours and is it normal I found the short period of withdrawal fun in a way?

I guess I was in deeper than I thought. I've been smoking half a pack a day for only about 8 months, and the previous 6 months I was smoking 5 cigarettes a day. Before that, on occasion only. 

Last week I didn't have a cigarette for 7-8 hours and usually I smoke half a pack a day. My friend grabbed my arm and in my normal state of mind, this would have only annoyed me and I'd probably would've said something about it. Instead I got this powerful feeling of rage over me and I kept thinking about how much I could beat the shit out him right at that moment. I managed to control it but not without insulting him for half an hour straight until I got my smoke, then I apologized.

The strange thing about this is that it was  that the rage made me feel really good, yet also like an asshole at the same time. I felt like I enjoyed being an asshole and I was wondering if this is a common feeling? 

I knew withdrawal and addiction were gonna be bad but not this bad. I never knew being dependent on a substance like nicotine could make me so angry. I'm gonna try and stop smoking really soon.

DAE get suicidal?

Hi guys, 

everything is in the title, really. I've been on and off for about two weeks. I've tried quitting at least twenty times since the beginning of my adult life. 11-years daily smoker. 

As soon as I have my first craving after stopping, I start getting suicidal ideation, which gets worse and worse by the hour. By the second or third day, I'm usually at the point where I don't look before crossing the street, hoping I'll just get hit by a car or something. 

Here is how I could describe my thought process: "if I relapse, I'm a POS that deserves to die. If I don't and keep this up, my life will be hell, forever, because people keep wanting to smoke even years after they've quit, so if I overcome this craving, there is just another one around the corner, which will most likely be just as bad a this one. Eventually, they might be more spaced out, but they will always be there. For my whole life. Oh God, this is unbearable. Why not just kill myself, then? It would be so much easier if I was dead. Dead people don't have to live through this bullshit, and they don't smoke either."

I should mention that I do have depression, anxiety, probably other mental health stuff and I'm already lightly suicidal (like, "Hahahah I wanna die look at this relatable meme about life sucking" suicidal) on an ordinary Tuesday, but obviously the withdrawal makes all of these at least ten times worse. 

The longest I've quit is three months, and it was still like that. If anything, it was worse than the first week, because I was losing hope it would get better, too. 

I won't actually try to kill myself, by the way, relapse is much more likely. At least, if I'm trying to stop smoking, successfully or not, it means that I haven't completely given up on getting better in my life. However, it is exhausting when your brain constantly tells you that death is the best option.

DAE deal with that?

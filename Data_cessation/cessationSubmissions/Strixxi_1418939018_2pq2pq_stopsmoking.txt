Holy Triggers

So lesson seriously learned yesterday. Something I already knew but I just got punched in the face with it yesterday. Surprise triggers are just going to keep coming up! We used nicotine to cope with so many things! 

Just yesterday I did a massive clean up of the house. I don't really like cleaning, so I would always reward myself with a smoke after a big clean like this one. This was even after quitting cigarettes. Just my little reward I got every few months when the house needed a deep clean.

But now I am done for good, so I didn't get my reward yesterday. Put me in to a towering rage that didn't dissipate until I woke up this morning.

Ouch ouch ouch. Be vigilant guys, these things can just pop up out of no where

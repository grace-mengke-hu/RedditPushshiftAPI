Feeling so sad and moody

I've had a somewhat complex relationship with tobacco. I started out with cigarettes, then started using snus and vaping in order in order to stop smoking. That led me to becoming addicted to all three. Yes, it did cut down on normal cigarettes to the point that a packet could last 2-3 days but I never gave them up completely.    


However about three months ago I decided enough was enough and and quit cigarettes and vaping while only using snus for about six weeks. It was relatively easy. Sure I missed the smoking, the feel of holding the cigarette or puffing with my e-cigg but it was manageable as I still go my nicotine fix from snus. Then, about five weeks ago I gave up snus.  


The first two or three weeks were tough but manageable. I got cravings but managed to soldier on. I've gotten to the point now that the cravings are more or less gone but my mood is shot to hell. The last two weeks I've felt so sad and moody. I feel so lonely, even when I have people near me. It's like all the joy has been sucked out of life all of a sudden. I'm close to crying at times.  It's hard to describe it but it's like I got this hole in my stomach or like having butterflies when getting really nervous. Imho it's much worse than having regular cravings. Anyone know how long this will go on? Or have any advice on how to handle it? Because if this keeps going on for much longer I'm seriously considering going back to snus or vaping.

2 Year anniversary after midnight tonight

I have never felt better about myself, my health or my wallet since I've quit smoking. I have no urge to pick one up, even if I am around people who smoke. It was not a New Year's resolution though. I had decided long before that I was going to quit, but I knew it would have been hard because I own a landscaping business so I could smoke any time if I wanted to since I worked outdoors. I knew it would be easier quitting in the winter since I don't have any work and spend most of my time indoors. We stopped working for the season just before Christmas that year and I knew I would be social during the holidays and I would smoke. I just decided that after the holidays would be the end for me and it was. Had my last 2 cigarettes shortly after midnight and haven't looked back. 

I think NOT making it a resolution made it easier because there wasn't that sense of obligation. I just chose New Years as the day because of my circumstances.

Anyway, just wanted to share that and wish everyone who will be quitting the best of luck at remaining smoke-free. It's hard, but not impossible. And, if you fail, it's ok. Just try again. You'll get there.

Happy New Year everyone!!!

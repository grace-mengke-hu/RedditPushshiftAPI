It's been awhile, but I need your help again

Hello r/stopsmoking. I haven't been active in a few months, but I desperately need your support again. I asked my husband for a divorce a few weeks ago. We have been married for a total of 5 years and together for a total of 7. Five of those years were spent in a lie I found out after the birth of our daughter. He did not cheat, but we are two fundamentally different people. I have tried to get to know a whole new side to my husband that I just can't love. 

We are choosing to send my daughter out to live with his parents in Virginia for two to six months so we can finalize the divorce and become financially independent from one another. Unfortunately, we cannot afford for our daughter to live with us. With everything that has happened. She leaves next week Thursday. I have never been away from her longer than three days. She is my life, and I would do anything for her but I need to pick myself back up to be a better person so I can be a better mommy. While I feel this is the smartest decision, it is the most painful. I picked up smoking again a few weeks ago,  and I can't bring myself to stop. I want to so badly because it makes me feel shameful, guilty, weak and hideous. My mind has tricked me into believing that it has been numbing all the pain. I know it's not, but I seriously cannot stop. The anxiety that comes from smoking is back. I am not properly taking care of myself which I know is making this all worse. Can somebody please offer me some encouragement?!?!?!

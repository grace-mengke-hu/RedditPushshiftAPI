Haven't smoked in over a week (would be two weeks but I drank and smoked the first week in one night) but I am not reaping in the benefits of "breathing easier". Why? Because I have bronchitis.

Probably due to the smoking. I got a cold, I didn't smoke for a few days and decided to keep going and now it's been one week/almost two weeks.   
I can't breathe easier because I am sick, I am still coughing, and my lungs are sore AF. I am also not feeling energetic because of being sick and I just started a new job.  
I guess I just need some motivation because it feels like I'm not doing any better than when I was smoking. I won't smoke while I'm sick but I'm worried once I'm better (whenever that'll be) I'll start again since I haven't had that *wow* feeling.

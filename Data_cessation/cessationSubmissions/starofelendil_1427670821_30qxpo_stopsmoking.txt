I also didn't smoke last night!

I noticed a lot of people partied last night and stayed strong. I drank a lot last night. My SO even rolled one for his friend but I didn't smoke. I didn't complain about wanting one (even though I did). I'm really happy with myself. In the past, after nights that I drank and smoked way too much, I would wake up the next morning with horrible chest pain. Even then I would reach for my pack and head outside. 

I like that I can lie in bed on the weekends and not feel compelled to go outside. I like that I don't smell so terrible. I like that people at work notice and congratulate me (I must have really stunk). This feels really good.

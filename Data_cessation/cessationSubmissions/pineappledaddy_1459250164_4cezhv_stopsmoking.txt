24 hours in and I'm struggling.

I've made it 24 hours and I already feel like I should light up a cigarette, what helped you keep your mind off of smoking?

I'm already a gym rat and spend two hours everyday but that only works for a while. Everyone I know and mostly everyone I work with smokes. 

I just want tips and advice on how to stay focused, I've been smoking for a decade and I'm tired of it. I want out, it's the dumbest thing I ever did.

It's the little things...

Last night was day 2 of my quit (ignore the badge). Had 4 beers after dinner while watching the football, during which my team conceded a 90th minute equaliser...

Normally that'd be an extreme trigger but I'm happy to say I didn't cave :)

Hope everyone has a nice smoke-free day!

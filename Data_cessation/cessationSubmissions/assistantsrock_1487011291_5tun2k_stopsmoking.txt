Hubby didn't quit

So I caught my husband last Friday with a kiss.  He stunk/tasted like smoke and he admitted that he has been sneaking them since about the first month in.  Says he hid it from me so I wouldn't give up too.  I am really having issues with him lying to me.  Funny enough after the first day when it was all I could think about I haven't had issues not smoking.  I know quitting isn't easy and you have to be ready and he's gonna have to get there on his own I just hate that he lied.  Especially since I was always showing him my smoking app and saying that we were doing so well.  I think I just really wanted to vent and you guys get to hear it.  No plans here on going back to being a smoker though.  I think that this quit is finally it.  One day at a time guys and it only gets easier.  Thanks for listening everyone!

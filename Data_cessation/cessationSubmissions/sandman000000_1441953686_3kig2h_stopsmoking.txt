So, quit again today

I had quit back in March for a full month (which isn't too long I know), but had relapsed once someone had crashed into my wife's parked car (totalling it). We're also having a baby in the next few weeks, and now is really the time to stop. 

I'm going to do this time. For sure. I got to.

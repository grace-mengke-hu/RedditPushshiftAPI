3 Days....What can I expect?

I haven't smoked since Thursday night.  

This isn't my first attempt, but for some reason this doesn't seem as difficult as it was last time, when I gave in after 2 days.  I'm not experiencing such intense cravings as I was before.  Overall I honestly don't feel all that different, I just don't smoke when I think I want to smoke.

Is this normal?  I dont know if its going to get better or worse.

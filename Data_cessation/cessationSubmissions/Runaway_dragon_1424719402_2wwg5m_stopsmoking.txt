Stopping today, for real this time.

So I re-read Allen Carrs book, I want to quit. I am quitting. I want to be a none-smoker and I'm actually looking forward to that. Took my last one earlier today. Today it'll stick.

I'm slightly annoyed about the mental urges though. I keep having to remind myself and repeat why I'm stopping and why I *want* to stop. I'm not overly worried about that though, it's still early and once I calm down and adjust they'll calm down too. 

Don't misunderstand me, I'm excited and all. What I'm worried about is just because last time I was sure it was final too, I was very sure and I was free. For two years I was free. But it didn't last, I don't really know where I went wrong, but I don't want to fall back in the trap again.

I set a badge a few days ago but this time is for real. Just wanted to announce that.

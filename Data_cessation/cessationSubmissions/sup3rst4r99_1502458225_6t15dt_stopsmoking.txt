Anyone with anxiety disorder that quit smoking?

Hello!
So, not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or something but I'm pretty sure I qualify for that kind of diagnosis.
My doctor says my anxiety would be less if I quiti smoking/snusing. I'm skeptical of it, but I thought I'd ask you.

I want to quit, very much so, but I keep on smoking/snusing to keep my anxiety from becoming worse (Which I know it will be in the first few months). 

But I want to hear from people who have stayed quit for several months (more than 3 months), if it had a really positive effect on their anxiety/depression?

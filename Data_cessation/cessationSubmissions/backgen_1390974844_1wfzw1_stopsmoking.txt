2nd day and DAMMIT I WANT ONE SO BADLY!!

So 2 days ago I finished allen carr's book the easyway to stop smoking - had my last one with a smile on my face and threw the rest of the pack along with my lighters down the garbage shoot.

I felt really happy for the first few hours and was able to combat the pangs during the first day by thinking positive ans following the books advice.

But now...its day 2, im back at work- sweating profusely, legs shaking, teeth grinding and all I can think of is how I used to go downstairs ans enjoy a nice cig break.

Help!!!!!!!

Edit: - just noticed i still have my badge from the last time i tried quitting...can someone remind me how to update?

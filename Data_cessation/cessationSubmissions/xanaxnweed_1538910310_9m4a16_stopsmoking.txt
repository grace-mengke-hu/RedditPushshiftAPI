Tobacco gives me anxiety and depression and i cant quit

i totally hate smoking cigarettes, i have panic disorder and smoking triggers it, i feel pretty good when i dont smoke but at some point i find myself buying a new pack of cigarettes. i am so addicted. i associate smoking with almost anything, drinking anything except for water makes me want to smoke one. after sex, after eating, in the morning. by brain aches for it after couple hours of not smoking. how do i stop this bad habit?

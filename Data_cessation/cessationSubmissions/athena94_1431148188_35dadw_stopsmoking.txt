Quitting again.

Two months ago I made a post saying I was done smoking. That lasted all of about four days. My mom is a 20+ year chain smoker, and every time I've quit she seems to smoke around me a lot. Almost like she doesn't want me to stop. So, you guessed it, I bummed "just one cigarette" off her and was back to a half pack a day. I have been smoking American spirits these past two months in preparation to make quitting FOR REAL this time easier, since they're just tobacco without all the crazy additives. I also got my old vape back up and running, it's the only thing that helped me quit for six months in the past before I slipped up.

I am on day two now and it's honestly been fine. I did have a crazy-gotta have it now- craving when I woke up this morning but it went away once I vaped. I'm only a very low nicotine e juice and plan on slowly tapering off it. I know a lot of people here are advocates for cold turkey, and while I highly respect that method, the 50+ times I tried to quit that way lasted a few short days. 

My common denominator in slipping up is seeing someone smoking and bumming one. So I'm gonna have to tell my smoking friends that they can't smoke around me. My mom is especially a huge enabler so I'll really have to be blunt with her about it. 

I feel very confident about it this time. Here's to not smoking today! :)

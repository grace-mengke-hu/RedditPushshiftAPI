Just put out my last smoke.

I'm 25 and have been smoking since I was 11.  When I started, it was once or twice a week.  Now I smoke 1-2 packs a day.  I have been trying to quit on and off for the last couple of years, although all attempts have gone up in smoke (forgive the pun).  I have been feeling the physical effects for the last half decade or so.  Fatigue is the least of them.  I really need to quit however I feel as if I am trapped until I'm in my grave.  Smoking has been my companion in solitude, my calming in times of stress, and - sad to say - my friend (who is killing me slowly).  After browsing this subreddit, I have decided to give it another go.  

I suppose thanks for the inspiration - I'll post updates as it goes.

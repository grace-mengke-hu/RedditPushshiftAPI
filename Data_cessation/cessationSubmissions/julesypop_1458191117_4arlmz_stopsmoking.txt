Just quit 2 weeks ago, cravings are way intense today

I smoked for about 6 years, quit for 2 years, picked it back up for 2-2.5 more years and I just quit again a little over two weeks ago. 

At the end of February, I caught the flu and didn't have the energy to smoke a cigarette if I wanted one and something in my brain just snapped and I wanted to quit agian. I haven't had a cigarette since February 27th and I have been very strong so far.

Honestly, it's been a surprisingly easy 2 weeks. All my triggers have been fairly easily subdued. Coffee-- No cigarette, no problem. Driving to work-- no cigarette, no problem. Drinking and going to a bar where smoking is allowed-- no cigarette, no problem. Up until today, I'm feeling STRONG.

Today, some really emotional shit hit the fan and there is nothing I want more right now than a cigarette (or 5). 

I haven't caved. But the desire is stronger than I've ever experienced and I just felt like I needed some support. It's nice getting it off my chest, especially to people who understand the struggle.

Thank you.

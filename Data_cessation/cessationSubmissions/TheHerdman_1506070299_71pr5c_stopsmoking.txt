Advice please

Quit smoking 8 days ago. Heart palpitations and fluttering, anxious thoughts have been with me this whole time.  Palpitations are getting better. But I have this growing numbness, as if my heart can't connect to anything.  I think of my girlfriend and feel nothing.  This is quite the opposite of how I felt before I quit smoking.  All I know is that I quit, and now I feel almost apathetic sometimes. I don't want to feel like this anymore....it's like I can't remember feeling happy and not constantly being locked in a battle within my mind.

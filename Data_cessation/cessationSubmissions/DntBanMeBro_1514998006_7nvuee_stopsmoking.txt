Trying to quit been a few days but...

I keep letting myself to have a drink and one smoke after work. Seems to get me through the day. I feel kinda...dirty for it but, even if thats as far as i make it its better then nothing. Been smoking for 12 years anyone else do something like this while beginning to quit?

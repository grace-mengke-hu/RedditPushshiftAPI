I've been smoking since 2002 and I'm quitting today. I'm just writing this down so it can be a real thing, opposed to my many failed thoughts of quitting.

A friend gave me an awesome motivational talk he other day and he said "being smokers, me and you have probably lived our half our lives already".

That hit me like a bolt of lightning. Life's gone so quick already (I'm 29) and I need to get as many years out of my time here, for the sake of my 3 month old son at least.

I probably smoked about 20 yesterday just to make the most of it, and now I feel like I can't breathe. Fuck smoking, I won't miss this shit.

EDIT: Thanks for the messages wishing me good luck and all the advice you've given me. I do have Allen Carr's book on my bookshelf, it's been gathering dust for the last two years, so thanks for reminding me of its existence!

My cravings have kicked in hard but I'm suppressing it well at the moment. For anyone else who's struggling, I recommend you download an app called Get Rich or Die Smoking. It works out how many you smoke a day, how much you spend per day/week/month/year, and other interesting stats.
You also have the option to set yourself a reward, which I've done to give me something to work towards. 13 days of no smoking and I'll have saved enough money to meet Ric Flair at a meet and greet :-)

Best of luck to you all and thanks again.

Resetting the Badge...

The events in the US over the past few weeks have pushed me to the breaking point. I am an emotional disaster. I have been drinking again (it's been a while), and now smoking. But I made it 4 months, and I know I can do it again. I'm going to finish this pack, and then restart. I want to thank all of you here for being a support network. I feel that my time here with y'all will make it easier to quit again.    
Peace.

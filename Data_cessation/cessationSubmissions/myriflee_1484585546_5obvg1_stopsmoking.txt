School starting the 23rd

Hey guys, 

I've been trying to quit this entire break to no avail. Today I'm feeling pretty confident that I'll be able to put it behind me. Need some honest feedback though. I've got a pretty intensive school year coming up that has me worried. I assume the first week of school won't be too bad, meaning I'll be roughly 2 weeks without nicotine by the time things start getting serious. Do you think I'll be reasonably functional by then (i.e. no headaches/brainfog and some energy)?

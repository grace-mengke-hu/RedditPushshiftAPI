Here's to all the Day 1's! Come on in the Water's Fine!

Just a word of encouragement to those just starting on their journey to better health and longer life!  I never ever thought I could quit smoking.  I love it so.  But I smoked so long that my body couldn't take it anymore and I either had to quit or I would soon be suffering a miserable remainder of my life.  

I suggest not waiting so long as I did. 

You can do this... the way I succeeded was just go at it craving by craving.  Good luck!

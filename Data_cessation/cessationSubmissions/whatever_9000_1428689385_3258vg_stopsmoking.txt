I've been writing down all of my brain's BS rationalizations for smoking and then refuting them

I'm in my third week of cold turkey, despite the best efforts of a brain that has been playing tricks on me the entire time... It constantly feeds me excuses and rationalizations; it always wanted me to start smoking again. In a moment of weakness, these rationalizations are enough to have you driving to that familiar gas station to pick up a pack. Realizing this, I decided to not trust my brain at all on this quitting attempt. Instead, I wrote down the excuses and then refuted them. The craving had often passed by the time I was done writing.

ANYWAY, I figured I would just paste these here. Maybe it will help other people too.

**I enjoy smoking**

No you don't. Everyone knows cigarettes stop being enjoyable after a few months. Then it becomes a habit.  You walk outside, suck hot air into your lungs, and then walk inside. You don't even notice you're doing it until you need to buy more.  After six years of buying and sucking on these things you can't remember more than a dozen times when it was noticeably enjoyable, beyond simply satisfying a craving that smoking created in the first place. The first cigarette of the day is sometimes nice (because you're craving so bad), but not when it's -30 degrees outside. It also makes you sick half of the time.

If it's so great, why don't you recommend it to anyone?

**Cigarettes go well with coffee**

Nicotine reduces the effects of caffeine in coffee. Cigarettes reduce your sense of taste, especially for bitter tastes, which makes coffee taste worse. To top it off, coffee and cigarettes will make you shit yourself. What a great combination!

**They go great with beer/drinking**

Not really. Alcohol just creates an intense craving and maybe the first few puffs is enjoyable. Other than that, it's just habitual smoking like any other night. Plus, lots of random things go well with drinking. That's part of what makes drinking fun. So what?

**They go great with [XYZ]! I'll never enjoy [ABC] again!**

Then how do non-smokers enjoy these things? Your brain is just conflating the two things. You enjoy things because of their own merits, cigarettes have nothing to do with it.

**But I love [insert brand loyalty here, Marlboro Reds, American Spirits, whatever]**

No you don't. If that brand disappeared, you'd just smoke something else. If chocolate strawberry menthols taken from the bottom of a lake and dried with consecutive farts were the only cigarettes left, you'd still smoke those.

**But smoking is cool!**

You'd be embarrassed to make this argument before you started smoking. You sound like the bad kid in a D.A.R.E video 

**What about Don Draper? Clint Eastwood? The Marlboro Man??**

Don Draper is a fictional character played by Jon Hamm, a nonsmoker. He smokes fake, herbal cigarettes on the show. Clint Eastwood is also a nonsmoker, which is why those cigarillos he had were usually not lit. Several "Marlboro Men" died of smoking-related diseases and had family members come out against smoking.

Seriously, you have never seen a cool habitual smoker. Ever. You've never seen a smoking cowboy, or soldier, or model, or whatever. But you've seen plenty of overweight office drones smoking while sitting in traffic. 

**Smoking makes me independent, nobody can tell me what to do**

How can addiction be a sign of independence??

**It helps me concentrate**

It is a mild stimulant that leaves you tired afterward. Any productivity you gain is lost by the constant cravings and all the time you waste outside.

**It  reminds me of time spent travelling, etc.**

You can afford a yearly, weeklong trip to Europe with the savings from smoking...

**It helps me sleep**

Then why are you advised to avoid smoking before bed?

**It's [insert weather or season here], I miss smoking**

Complete nonsense, simply a weird brain trick I guess.

There are others, but they are mostly personal or anecdotal so I don't think they'll be of interest really. But that's the list and feel free to add to it, if you want.


OH YEAH, and:

Cancer, fatigue, endless cravings, ridiculous expense, terrible taste, terrible smell, social stigma.

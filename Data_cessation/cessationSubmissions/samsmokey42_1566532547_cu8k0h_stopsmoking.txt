Day 4 and feeling great!

Feels so good to have made it this far. I cant believe how mentally addicted I was, I've replaced the word cigarette with fresh air whenever I have a craving and it's working wonders. Convincing yourself that you dont enjoy smoking is so much more important than willpower I've found. So much love for this community, really helps reading others experiences :)

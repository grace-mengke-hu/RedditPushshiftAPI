Trying to stop smoking for the third time

Hi all. Today I'll go cold turkey after I finish my last pack of cigarettes. It's the third time I'm trying to stop. The first time I managed to be smoke-free for at most two weeks; the second time I've managed almost half a year after I read Alan Carr's book but failed due to university stress (I was just making excuses for myself). 

Now that I've graduated and am getting my life sorted out I've decided I should stop again - I miss those 4-5 smoke-free months. 

I'm very scared - whenever I think about stopping I fill myself with anxiety, because I'm not sure if I have the proper will-power to do it again. It feels harder and harder every time I try to stop, but hopefully I learnt what mistakes I've done during my past attempts. 

I posted here because I feel I need some motivation and I know it's not gonna come from myself during the first week at least. 

Thanks everyone on this sub for being so supportive and awesome and hopefully this is the last time I have to go through this!

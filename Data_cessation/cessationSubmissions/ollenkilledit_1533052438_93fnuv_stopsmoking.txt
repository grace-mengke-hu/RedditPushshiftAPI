Maybe unpopular but once I learned how to quit, I can have a cig with a beer every 2 months or so and get right back on the horse.

I don't know man. I chain smoked for 10 years I read alot of text posts on here where its really apocalyptic regarding YOU ARE EITHER A SMOKER OR NOT ONE. Dude I think we are just all humans and all the pressure people put on themselves makes things 10x harder than it needs to be. Since I have quit a year ago I have had maybe 8 cigarettes and they were fun one night stands man! The next day just right back on the horse. I'm not saying it's right for you but if you guys happen to fold one hammered night. Treat it like a cigar and a little treat to yourself esp if you've been busting your ass. Life's going to be alright man.

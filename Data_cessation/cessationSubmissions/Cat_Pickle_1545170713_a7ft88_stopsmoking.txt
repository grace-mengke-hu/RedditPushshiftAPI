Quitting smoking in early sobriety?

Hello all! I’m new here. I’m an alcoholic and on day 37 of not drinking. In the absence of alcohol I’ve doubled down on my smoking, and am feeling ready to be done. Some of the advice I’ve received from my sponsor and others in AA is to wait to quit smoking before I have some more sobriety, and to focus on quitting one thing at a time. Anyone here been through this? As much as I would like to quit smoking, something I absolutely cannot do is compromise my sobriety.

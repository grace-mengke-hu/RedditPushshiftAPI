Today is the day...

It's August, 24th, at 01:00 hrs, and I just smoked my last cigarette... I've been smoking for 29 years, give or take. I'm ready, not to give up smoking, but to live a life as a non smoker. I feel strong. I can't wait to see the results on my VO2max, can't wait to get my sense of smell back, my sense of taste. I'm doing this for me, for my kid. I just can't wait... Kind of crazy to think that doing absolutely nothing might be the hardest thing I've ever done. I want it so bad ❤️

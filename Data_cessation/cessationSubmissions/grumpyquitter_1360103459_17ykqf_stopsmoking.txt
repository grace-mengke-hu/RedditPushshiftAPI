Issues with Support from a Non-smoking Partner?

Has anyone had issues with support from a non-smoking partner?
I've quit before while with my first husband so I know what to expect.  I'm a bear for a few days and I know it.  I've tried a couple times with this husband and he's openly admitted he has no concept of what quitting is like.  I try not to be a complete b*tch but it feels like I'm starving so... yeah.  I end up being curt and crying a lot.  He makes me feel horrible about myself and I end up buying another pack after we get into a fight.  Any advice beyond stop being such a b*tch would be appreciated.
As a side note, I'm quitting because we plan for me to get off birth control in September.  I'm worried if he can't handle me being emotional for a 3-10 days he won't be able to provide the support I need while I'm carrying the baby.  Valid concern or am I being crazy?

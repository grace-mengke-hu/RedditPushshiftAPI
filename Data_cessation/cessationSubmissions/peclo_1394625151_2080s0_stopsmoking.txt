5-0-0!

That's 500 days without a smoke, after 10 years of smoking.

Feels great, I don't even feel attraction to cigarettes. I have a bit of nostalgia when I see someone smoke in a movie, but that lasts only around 3-4 seconds.

Someone posted that he needed to resert its badge at 500, so I'm still vigilent.

I owe much to this subreddit!

Cheers to you all, newcomers or veterans!

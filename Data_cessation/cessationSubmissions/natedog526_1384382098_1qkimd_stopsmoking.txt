On to day 4...

Had a few moments where I really wanted a smoke. They passed much like taco bell yesterday. Realized that I had been counting my days wrong. I'm actually starting my 4th day today, well tonight because I work third shift and my days tend to get a little weird because I actually have to think a day ahead of normal... Where was I? Oh right. So outside of that things are going as expected. I'm in the stage where I feel like someone has punched me in the gut. As I understand it, this is where my body starts to clean out more and my immune system starts kicking back in and repairing the damage to my body. Not much else to talk about at this point really. I just keep moving forward for now. In large part to all the advice I have gotten, I am going to start picking up a few more good habits next week. Want to get a solid week of this under my belt before I start taking on more items though. Good luck to all my other fellow quitters and keep at it. :)

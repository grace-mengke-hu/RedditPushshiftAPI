Hey, new on here few questions.

i have chantix starting month supply and regular ones that i dont need since i quit smoking while back but my insurance covers it 100% so i always pick it up. Is there any place where i can get rid of it for few bucks to some1 who actually needs or tries to quit smoking ? CVS brand and everything US

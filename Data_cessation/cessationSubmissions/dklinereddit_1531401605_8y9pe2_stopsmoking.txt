smoked for 4 days after 4.5 months free

Familiar person I hadn't seen in a while who I used to smoke with likely contributed to the relapse.  I had been strong around others I had previously smoked but ultimately I know it is my fault.  4 days free now - frustrated bc I knew the risks but still broke my streak.

First Chantix!

I’ve been wanting to quit smoking for awhile. I quit once successfully on my own without any medication for about 3 years. I started back again unfortunately and am more addicted than ever. I smoke about a half to a pack a day roughly. I really don’t like myself for smoking I feel gross doing it. But I can’t stop. My doc gave me Chantix. I’ve been too apprehensive to take it thus far. But today I finally took my first tablet. The first few days I only take one a day then after 3 days two a day. It’s been about 2 hours since my pill and I don’t feel anything at all so far. Slight nicotine cravings still but nothing like the usual. Guess it twill be a cumulative thing it will take awhile for it to build up and make my brain not want a cigarette. At least that’s my hope. I’m coughing a lot and the cigarettes are really taking a toll on me. I hope this works. I’m only 35. I know I can do it but it’s tough. I’m also a little afraid of gaining weight if I quit. I definitely don’t want to be fat.

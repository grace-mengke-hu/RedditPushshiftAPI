te·na·cious : persistent in maintaining, adhering to, or seeking something valued or desired

Be persistent and relentless in your quit my fellow quitters. Endure and embrace the cravings, because the tides will turn, and when they do you will reap the benefits. To those just starting their quit, resetting their badges, on the fence about quitting, and to those veteran quitters who are going on 365+ days, I offer you one piece of advice; stay tenacious.

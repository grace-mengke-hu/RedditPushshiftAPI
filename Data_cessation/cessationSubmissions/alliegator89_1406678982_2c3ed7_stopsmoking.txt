Was having a craving so I yelled at a cigarette

(Let me preface this by saying I would NOT go out and buy a pack to just yell at some cigarettes.  My husband is still smoking so they were around the house.)

Having really strong cravings tonight.  Looked at my husband's pack of cigarettes and yelled at them.  I told them they were stupid, stinky, killers.  Told the cigarettes that I don't want them in my life any more and that I will not smoke them.  Then I walked away.  It sounds a little silly, but it felt great!

It's been 4 days today and I think the worst is over.

I have been an avid pot smoker and tobacco smoker for the last 3 years, I smoked at least a ten bag a day and would normally smoke 5 rollies/cigarettes a day.

I had this terrible depressive feeling almost everyday lately and decided to take action and quit smoking anything completely.

I'd been trying to quit for the last month but alas no progress was made as I gave into my cravings and social surroundings after a day or 2 at most!

Now I've started to quit again, started working out, eating properly and can safely say that I don't feel any cravings at all. After viewing some info-graphs and information from this sub-reddit, I have taken it upon myself to quit and will keep it that way for as long as I possibly can!

Can I have a cool flair now? :)

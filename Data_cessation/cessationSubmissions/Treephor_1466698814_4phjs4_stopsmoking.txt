It's been 5 days since my last cigarette and I feel like garbage.

I've decided to finally bite the bullet and quit smoking. I'm a pre-service teacher in the first year of my BEd and want to be a better influence for my future students. I really want to look for effective strategies for when I am craving a cigarette. I haven't been managing particularly well and have bitten several painful ulcers into my mouth and lips (I look like I've been punched in the mouth) and have been incredibly irritable and depressed. I plan on buying a vape* next week to try and keep me sane, but I don't want to use it as a long term fix. Has anyone got any strategies that they have found effective during the first few weeks of quitting?

Edited to add: Selling juice with nicotine is illegal within Australia, but can be legally imported for personal use. I don't intend to purchase nicotine juices because having them imported and paying international transaction fees would end up costing me the same amount as a couple of pouches of tobacco and would defeat the purpose.

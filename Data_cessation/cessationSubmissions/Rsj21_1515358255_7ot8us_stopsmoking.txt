Do you have to WANT to quit?

Ok, so, i have been trying to quit smoking for about two months now, to no success. My main reason for quitting is money. Here in Australia we get smashed in prices for cigarettes at $1 per smoke. You can show me all the Black Lungs and Gangrene Feet in the world and i would still smoke i think. However, show me my dwindling bank account as i spend around $120 per week on Cigs and that makes me want to stop... Well, to be honest, no it doesn't. It just makes me want to stop paying for them, that's all. I love smoking, from my morning smoke with coffee to the after dinner smoke.

So, i suppose what am i asking here is; Do you have to WANT to quit, to quit? and how can i possibly "force" myself to have the desire to quit?

Any tips are much appreciated.

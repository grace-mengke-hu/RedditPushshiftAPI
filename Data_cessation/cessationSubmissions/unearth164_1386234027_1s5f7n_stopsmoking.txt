1 month under my belt.

I still feel exhausted and crappy at times but going to the gym and eating right definitely helps. Sometimes I wish I could have the feeling of smoking without the actual prop, but it's reassuring to know I've kicked it. I know this post doesn't really have much of a point but I feel proud I've made it this far. :)

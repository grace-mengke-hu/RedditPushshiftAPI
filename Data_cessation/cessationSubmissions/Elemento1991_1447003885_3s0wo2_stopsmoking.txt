Cravings have been coming back with a vengeance at two months. Anyone else struggle around this time?

What's up guys. I haven't come close to caving but I'm just wondering if you guys started to get cravings around this time? For a while there I was going entire days where I wouldn't even think about it, even when I saw people smoking I wouldn't crave. Now all of the sudden it seems like my cravings are just as strong as when I first quit. I was an ecig user for the last year of my addiction and I even have been reaching to pull it out of my pocket initially before I realize what I'm doing. I never reached for it after the first three weeks. 

Is this just another step in recovery? I'm still feeling strong and in a way too proud to go back. I would be so disappointed in myself if I was weak like that, but just curious what others have experienced. 

Thanks in advance for any insight

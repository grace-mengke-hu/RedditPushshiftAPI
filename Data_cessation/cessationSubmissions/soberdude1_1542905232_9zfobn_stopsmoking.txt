Feeling Thankful Today

Just wanted to share the gratitude today. Six years ago today, I finally had my last cigarette. Thanks to Mr. Allen Carr and his amazing book, The Easy Way To Stop Smoking I am finally a free man. From a pack and a half a day smoker for 40 years, to non-smoker overnight. 

If you're a new quitter, struggling or on the fence, never stop quitting. Sooner or later it's gonna stick. The human body doesn't require nicotine. You won't die from a craving, no one ever has. Cravings pass if we smoke, they also pass if we don't.

Happy Turkey Day my fellow quitters.

First day, here is to saving a shitload of money and not smelling funky.

I've been smoking for about 4 years now, pack a day for probably about 2. I live in Australia and have to cough up around $20 a pack.

That's $140 a week, for what?

I threw the rest of my pack in a bin on my way to work this morning, on a whim. Wish me luck!

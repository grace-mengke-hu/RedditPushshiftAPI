17 days smoke free

For the record, I was the king of smoking. I loved it. Pretty much always had a smoke hanging out my mouth when I could smoke. To be honest, it wasnt the health that really scared me (most of us know the risks and are desensitized) For me it was the money, and feeling like a slave to smoking. I hated the fact tht I spent so much of my money for something I got little to no benefit out of and how it controlled my life. Pretty much, not wanting to be a bitch to a piece of paper and some leaves / spending $400 a month on cigs made me quit

So far, so good. I quit using Champix and re-reading Allen Carr. The first day was ok, but after work is when I craved the most. Day 2 was better. Day3 kind of sucked but just went to the gym after work and went to bed early. Day 4 and onwards started craving less and less. last weekend I had a proper drinking session for the first time and didnt smoke at all! Thats a good sign. But ive also drank less anyways which isnt bad either.

The things that have helped so far
1.Knowing sooner or later I have to quit, Ive come this far and dont feel like dealing with those first few days again
2 Watching the money grow. Im a big smoker (pack atleast per day, 2 per day on weekends) When I quit I got a glass jar and everyday I put in $11 (how much a pack is in Canada) Friday and Saturday I put $22. Its very motivational.
3. Try to keep myself occupied. Including sleeping. I find especially on the first weekend I napped like crazy. You cant smoke if youre asleep

Good luck everyone, its not easy,but you can do it. You cant be forced and be in the right mindframe

Did I mess up?

So I have been a heavy smoker half my life (17 years off and and 17 on) with the last 5 lighting more than 30 a day. Stopping seemed impossible. So 18 days ago I went to the dentist and due to an operation she forbade smoking for two days and I kept it up until tonight. Didn't feel any strong urges to have one or anything of the sort.

Nevertheless, we went out with a couple of colleagues today (who are heavy smokers) at a bar and it was full of smoke. I am sure I breathed in at least 4 cigs worth although I again didn't light up for the three hours we were there. 

In your experience is passive smoking the same as when I smoked? Were my 18 days in vain and I have to count tomorrow as day 1 again even though I didn't smoke actively? I am so angry right now since I was progressing so easily.

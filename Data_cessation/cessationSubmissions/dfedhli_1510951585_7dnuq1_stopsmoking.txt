Slipped a few times and decided it's better ot reset my badge

Today would be my 174th day. I spent a lot of time thinking about whether I should reset my badge because I had a series of slips. I had even bought myself a pack and smoked the whole thing alone. I decided to reset it for the 3rd of this month, which is when I had my last cigarette. I need to be honest with myself that I basically put myself back on square one.

Thankfully I find smoke stinks again and I don't have many cravings. I used to love the smell, even as a child, and as an adult that continued, except for a two-week period where I couldn't smell the stuff without wanting to puke. I hope the disgust never goes away. I'm also a recently dry alcoholic and I have developed a massive distaste for alcohol which has protected me from a relapse on that front.

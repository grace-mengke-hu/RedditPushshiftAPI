What do you guys do to relax?

I‘m day 5 of quitting and so far it‘s going quite well. Have been smoking for 10 years nearly a pack a day. The biggest problem for me is the „relaxing“ part. Smoking always has been a way for my brain and body to „relax“, kind of a 5-minute vacation escaping the world around you leaving behind troubles and thoughts - totally dumb of course, but I’m sure many of you can refer to that. So from time to time my head starts tellin me stupid things like „you need a cigarette to relax“ - of course I won‘t give in cause I know exactly that this is bullshit and that my silly brain only tries to convince me doing that shit again. I just wondered what you guys do to relax?

I used to smoke

The craving stopped 1 month ago, I had smoked for 5 years at that point and smoked more than a 40g satchel of tobacco a week. I don't know how or why it happened. Is there anyone around here with a similar experience ? 

It is noteworthy that I was not trying to stop, but I did use the opportunity. I am still a bit weirded out by it.

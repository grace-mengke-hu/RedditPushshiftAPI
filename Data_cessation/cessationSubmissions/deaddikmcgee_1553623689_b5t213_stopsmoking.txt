I didn't smoke my morning cig (Journal Entry)

And I'm feeling alright. I did have some coffee and smoked some weed. The craving is there. My mind keeps wandering to the idea of standing out there with my cig like every morning, but I'm ok with that. This too shall pass. I've been listening to Eckhart Tolle, and I'm trying to "separate" myself from the feelings. I am me and the craving/feeling is its own thing.

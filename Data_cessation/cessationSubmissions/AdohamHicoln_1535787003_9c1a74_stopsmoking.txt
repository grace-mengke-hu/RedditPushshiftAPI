Any tips for quitting smoking when all your friends smoke?

I’m trying to quit smoking for my health and my wallet but the majority of my social circle smoke and I’m finding it hard to quit. I’ve gone 4 months without smoking to relapsing when stress levels get high (due to uni exams or work) and my mates just offer me a ciggy. In addition, I always feel like I’m missing out when I stay inside while my mates go out for one. 

What are your tips for saying no?

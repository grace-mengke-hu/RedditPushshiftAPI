Partner 3 days without a cigarette. Is vaping a good idea to replace the habit?

She's been smoking for around 4 years, and has built up to 10-15 rollups a day. She's tried to stop smoking a few times, but this time she's made it almost 3 days so far, and she says the hardest part is the craving for the action of smoking a cigarette.

She got a vape last time she tried to quit, but it didn't seem to give her the desired effect, so she ended up still smoking just as much.

Is it a better idea to try and stay the course and not smoke or vape anything, or give the vape pen another go with a 0mg fluid?

Need some advice/help for quitting

So like all of you fine people I've decided to use reddit to improve myself and not just for funny cat pics. 

A Little background about myself: I'm 20 years old and have been smoking for about the last 6 months.  It started as a alternative to stop smoking weed and I used a hookah pen in the beginning and them upgraded to black&milds and dajurms. It was a when I'm bored thing them ended up turning into a smoke In the morning to work, then turned into driving anywhere and before I sleep and just turned into a routine for me. The last I slowly drifted away from the gym and can't sleep or get the taste out of my mouth for one. I got fed up with it this weekend playing paintball this weekend at a bigger field and just feeling to drained to even play and so out of breath 

  I've tried chewing gum and kind of limited my self to one a day but wanna just be done with it completely. I've set goals for my self and really wanna stick to them and made sure they weren't something that can be accomplished next week. 

I would go to my family about quitting but they have no clue I even do it and feel would be to disappointed to even talk to me. One of the main reason I came here is because  I can see how support this subreddit is and after reading stories of chronic smokers quitting I need to be as strong as them. 

I'm deciding today's the day to quit just need some help breaking out of the routine when going cold turkey

Thanks for any help

Were any of you runners before you stopped smoking?

Since I've stopped smoking I've been walking like crazy..I'm known as the girl who walks the white dog..small town :)   But I have this itch that I need to push myself, so once in awhile down dark allies I run.  Not far because I'm fat and not comfortable with it yet but I noticed today that I didn't get winded on the last two blocks. So I was curious if anyone ran before they stopped smoking and how did your endurance change?  I haven't ran since I was in high school...but I smoked then too.

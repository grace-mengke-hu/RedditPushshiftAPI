Today is my last day. I have a "quit-kit" but could use some advice.

I am terrible about making plans. But when I do I usually reach my goals. But I gotta say I am NERVOUS!

I have the next two weeks off from work so I don't have to worry about mood swings (at least not towards my co-workers)

I've stocked up on fruit (cause I'm going to snack like crazy) and LOTS of video games to keep me distracted.  Also have a workout routine.

After 14 years of smoking I feel like I'm ready. I have my quit-kit. But I'm just so damn nervous!  Any advice would be appreciated. Is there anything else I should add to my quit-kit?

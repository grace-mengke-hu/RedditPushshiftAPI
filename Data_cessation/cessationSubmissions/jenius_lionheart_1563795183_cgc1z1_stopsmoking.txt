Day 3 in Europe

And I still haven't caved! I was on a tour yesterday in Amsterdam and looking at all the smokes enviously and then the tour guide said "only 2% of Hollanders smoke, the rest is all tourists. The general opinion is that smokers are losers." ðŸ˜† cravings are not too bad - if I can make it this week here, hopefully I'll continue at home. Wish me luck!

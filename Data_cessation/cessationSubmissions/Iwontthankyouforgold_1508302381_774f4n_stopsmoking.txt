How do you handle drinking and smoking?

I've "pretty much stopped smoking" meaning if I'm sober I don't even think about it or want it. But the second I have a few beers in a public area, I start Fiending for cigs. Not only that but if I can't find any I get pissed. I've started by ahead of time taking 2 cigs with me when I go out so I don't get anxious, I know I have them but I only have two, but I'm in control. I've tried for years to get over this and even if I go a couple months without drinking or smoking, the second I get a little buzz I'm running around looking for nicotine. 

Any tips, help, experiences? It's gotta go away right? If it doesn't I'll probably just give in and die early.

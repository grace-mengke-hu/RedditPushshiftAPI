Stopping today

Hey, so this morning I emptied out the rest of my tobacco packet and rolled around 8 rollies out of it.

I rationed these throughout the day, and here I am at 5 in the morning just had the last one.

Tomorrow when I wake up is hopefully going to be my first smoke free day since I was 16 years old.

Please wish me luck!

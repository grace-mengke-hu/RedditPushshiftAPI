Day 1 --&gt; been smoking for 18 years

So i started when i was 13 years old, now im 31 years old and finallly fed up with smoking. I smoked a pack of 23 cigarettes in 1,5 day. My nicotine monster is verry strong atm. But this time i not let it win, i have a feeling of going nuts i wanna smoke so badly pffff.. but i know it just feed my addiction. Going cold turkey decided enough is enough. My goal is to buy a iMac with the saved money. So i gonna fight on with this shit, this time i will succeed. Thanks for reading and being supportive. Sorry for any mistakes its not my native language :-)

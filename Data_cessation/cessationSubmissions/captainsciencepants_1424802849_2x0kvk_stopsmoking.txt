Hey all, 

Just a message of encouragement to keep on keeping on... Not smoking. It's been since last Feb 6th for me and there is a lot of positive things to if you're in the beginning process. I don't want to spoil all the fun for you so I will mention one cool thing that happens... Taste buds! Your taste buds come back to life and you can experience some foods for the first time again! 

Best of luck to ya!

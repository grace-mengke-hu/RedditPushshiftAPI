I have quit again. My body really needs this. More of a spliff smoker than cigs. Not any more.

I want to cough up green phlegm as I did last October when I quit (before relapsing Nov-Feb). I am a cyclist so will be able to measure the difference in fitness, and am learning guitar so will measure the improvement in learning ability. I am trying to stay positive, so will not appreciate negative messages (damage already done, years lost etc). I looked at last year's journal and read: "I gave up smoking, it was easy." I'm on day 2.

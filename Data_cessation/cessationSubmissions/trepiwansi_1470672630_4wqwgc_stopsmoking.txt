I cried today

Today my dog died.  
I wanted to smoke so bad only to be reminded it has already been a year.  
kinda funneh how life wanted to celebrate with me.  
I wanted to thank this sub. Checking on this sub everyday during the beginning when i quit cold turkey was the key to my success.  
I was inspired by other people stories and in turn everytime i hit a milestone I would post here.  
You can do it I believe in you

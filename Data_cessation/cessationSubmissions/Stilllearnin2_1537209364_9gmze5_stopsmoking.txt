OJ and cream of tartar

Second time posting this.  I tried it (half heartedly) several months ago and was surprised at the effect.  But I wasn’t committed, had a ton going on, and forgot like two days in...

Anyway, I’m trying again.  Drank the OJ/cream of tartar this morning (instead of before bed like you’re supposed to) because I was afraid by the time bedtime rolled around I’d have lost the motivation...

Anyway, it’s very strange how the drink curbs cravings.  And I don’t think it is placebo.  

Still surprised not to find anyone talking about this on this sub.  

It’s time for me to quit, am up to almost a pack a day, for the last 5 years now since my marriage started to fall apart.  I’m a 50 yo female and this addiction is becoming a huge problem.  

Hoping this method, combined with some mental fortitude and commitment works.

3 weeks in, feeling strong

I've posted here in the past but never have been able to get past 3 weeks, but I'm about to in 14 hours! I've been using the phix e-cig and i really enjoy it.  I like the original tobacco flavor the best because it gives me the throats hit of an actual boge.  Even if it costs me more in the long run than buying packs, I don't care because I'm not smoking cigarettes!

Feeling Good, Advice on cutting down on NRT?

Quitting smoking this time has given me so much confidence and pride for myself. I'm still coughing up some nasty crap from time to time but way less then a month ago. I don't use many lozenges per day maybe 5 or 6, but it seems like I always have one in my mouth. I'm using the 2mg and I'd buy 1 mg if they sold them in town. I know its time to quit them too and I am working on cutting down. I have been trying to put them off, like if its 9:30 Ill say I wont have one until 10:00. I often won't think about it again until 11:00. I know this sub generally promotes complete abstinence but if there is anyone out there who quit using an oral NRT I would love to hear how it went for you! Thanks

Day 2: keep on keeping on

My chest hurts thus morning, I can't tell if more or less than usual (that was one of the reasons i committed to quit).     
    

I did start vaping, but the lowest nicotine I could find (3G) and only when I would have smoked cigarettes- the car, home after work.    
    

I've seen conflicting opinions on vaping here, so I'm not really asking about that, just...I don't know. Rambling. I kind of feel like crap but also feel mentally good, so...yeah.

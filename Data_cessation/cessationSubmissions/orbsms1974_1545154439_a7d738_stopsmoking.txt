Day 12

Just made it through day 12,i have had my ups and downs but it is worth fighting through. I had a lot of friends recommend using a vape as a replacement, I have taken to eating carrots rather than adding a different set of things that don't belong in my lungs. I am happy I have made it this far not just for me but for my family. It is worth it to make this change I can't list all the positives that have come out of it. Lean on others if you are struggling. I am happy to help when I can.


Thanks

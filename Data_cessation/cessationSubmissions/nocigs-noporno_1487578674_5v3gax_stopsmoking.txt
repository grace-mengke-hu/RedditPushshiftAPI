Hello smiley face

1 year and it went so fast.  Feels like yesterday.  If you havent heard yet read allen carr easy way to stop smoking.  Only thing that has gotten me to finally stop for good.  Or listen to the audio.  I have listen to it maybe 5 times fully.  I smoked for 10 years at a pack a day.  12 dollars is the cost of a pack now wtf.  What a waste of money.  I saved 4400 dollars.  Its really is easy to do.  Here to many more years to being smokeless.  Never stop trying to stop smoking.

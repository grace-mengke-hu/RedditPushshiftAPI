Restarting -Day 3

Made it 4 months without a single puff and I was so proud of myself! Then I smoked a couple cigarettes at a wedding at the end of May. Didn’t smoke again for a few days, thinking “maybe I can just smoke a few every so often”. Damn, was I WRONG!  I wish I would have believed everyone here when people said “not another puff, ever”. Three weeks later, I was back to smoking more than a pack per day. Smoked “full-time” again for a couple weeks, but on Wednesday I said “enough is enough” and bought some lozenges again! 3 days in, badge reset, stop smoking app reset, and I’m all in! 

NOT ANOTHER PUFF!! NEVER, EVER AGAIN!!

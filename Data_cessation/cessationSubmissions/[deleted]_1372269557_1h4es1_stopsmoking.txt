Terrible sleeping problem

Hi there every,
I'm currently on my fourth day. The past couple of days have been very up and down, but I still haven't caved. I was the worst nicotine addict I knew, and now all of a sudden I don't smoke, which is something I am so proud of.

I've been having this problem when I go to sleep that has started since day one of quitting. I will be asleep and then all of a sudden I will wake up with a huge fright and feeling like I need to breathe quickly in order to keep up with the speed of my rapidly-beating heart.
This feeling last for around a minute or two but is absolutely horrify.

This feeling has almost made me cave and go buy a pack of cigarettes because I would do almost anything not to feel like that again. At the same time, I would be so happy for this feeling to pass now so I can get over and see this feeling as part of quitting smoking, that way I would never start smoking again so I would never have to quit again.

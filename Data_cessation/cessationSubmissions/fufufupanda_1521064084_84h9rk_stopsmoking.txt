Nonsmoker for a month now but what is going on with my skin

Hey hey,
quitted smoking around half a year ago (went 4 months on vapepen and reduced nikotine step by step). Now i am actually smoke free for a month and not missing it. At home nobody smokes (or is on vapepen 0 nicotine phase now; so proud of them). I encounter smokers at work of cause. What really starts to bother me is my skin. In the first weeks i had like zits growing every day. Sometimes 5 or 6 in one night (never had them before also not as teenager). I know people so gross. Really big zits seem to go away but now i just have these reddish skin irritation basically every day. Little red spots and reddish inflamed cheeks (face ;D). I f'in hate it i look like some freak now who doesnt know how to wash his face in the morning. Has anyone observed the same thing? Does it go away? Or am i doomed running around with gross skin for the rest of my life. I ordered Cetrizin maybe this can help a little. Meh.

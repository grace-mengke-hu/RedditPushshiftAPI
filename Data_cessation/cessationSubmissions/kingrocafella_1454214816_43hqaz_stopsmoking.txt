Relapsed after 27 days no smoking... Beyond angry!

I have no idea what got into me last night. It's like I lost all control. I was very drunk, but I had already been out drunk and abstained from smoking 3ish times during these 27 days. I was just at a mates house when I lit up. 

I found myself rationalising. Like saying things like "when I'm older and I stop going out I'm not going to smoke" (I'm 22). I seriously felt like I couldn't control it. I remember the last two times I quit, the relapse happened around the 30 day mark both times. So weird... Why does that happen?

Anyway I ended up smoking around 10 cigarettes for the night, and when I came home I was so angry with myself. I don't really feel cravings for another one today, which is something I was expecting. I still want to keep quitting, but I guess I need to reset my counter now? 

It just feels really discouraging that I went almost a month and now I need to start the process all over again. Very frustrating. I'm not sure why I'm even writing this I guess I just needed to vent my frustrations.

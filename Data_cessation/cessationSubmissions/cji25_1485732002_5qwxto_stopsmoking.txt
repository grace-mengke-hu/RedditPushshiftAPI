Quit smoking by facing stress

So, I've been off cigarettes for one week now, and although it has been hard, it hasn't been impossible. I suppose it will get harder on upcoming days and weeks.

My method, if a little savage, has been very effective.

First of all, cold turkey.

Second, the hardcore part. I've been seeking all of the thrilling, upsetting and adrenaline-generating triggers I've been able to get. Fighting with my business-partner brother, having a fight with my girlfriend,  discussing important family matters with my parents, and riding a fairly deathwish trail on my bicycle.

So far I've been able to whitstand all of these triggers. I believe as soon as I get through all of these kind of tough triggers,  I'll be able to finally quit after 13 years.

So far I feel like I lost my best friend. I turn around to tell him/her something, but now I know, he/she will never be around again.

Your thoughts?

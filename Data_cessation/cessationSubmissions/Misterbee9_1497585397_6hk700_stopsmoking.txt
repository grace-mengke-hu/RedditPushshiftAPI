Stopped smoking cold turkey wanna share this!

So I smoked like 7 years a pack a day. And I am baffled because I woke up one day seeing if I can just stop for one day and I did. So I continued not smoking and threw away my electronic cigarette and now I haven't smoked for 34 days. I don't miss it at all and I am surprised at how easy it is.

Day 3

Fuck. Day one and two weren't half bad. Today though. Fuck today. Fuck anxiety and stress. Fuck balling my eyes out and being snippy. And fuck these intense cravings that say just have one, you've gone a couple days, one won't hurt.

 I'm not giving in, 3 days doesn't seem like much to the 10 years of smoking, but it is so much more than it seems. But jesus, I  had to get this out.

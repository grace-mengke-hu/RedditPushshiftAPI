One week down, forever to go. The cravings have hit. Egad.

Hey everyone. Dropping by in the hopes that this will help with some accountability and motivation.  I quit smoking a few years ago, and that lasted for about a year. Fell off the horse, but now I'm saddled up again.  I really, really want it to stick this time.  

People tell me I look young for my age, but I know that's only going to last for so long. I'm turning 39 this July, but I can see how my skin is changing. Oh, vanity. But hey, if that's what it takes to make a healthy decision, then it's worth something, right? Plus, I also want to get back into running. It's been I don't know how long since I could actually run a mile; my goal is to run a 5K by the end of summer or mid fall. I can do this, but only if I'm not coughing up a lung.

Cravings are now kicking in. The first few days weren't bad, but now I'm dreaming about smoking. :(  It doesn't help that I live with a smoker. Oh well, anything worth doing is still worth doing in the face of adversity.

Alrighty, good luck to all of us. You know, scratch that. It's not luck, it's strength. May we be strong.

What smoking cessation thought me about myself

As I said earlier, I cherish every moment of misery. It's a learning process, and I'm going to learn everything.

Why am I miserable though? I don't want to smoke. I don't envy smokers anymore, in fact, the smell starts to turn me off. I can sit along my husband and/or friends who smoke, and be a jolly camper who munches on carrots and watermelon flavoured gum.

I understood last night why am I miserable. Once again, I let my anxiety disorder and fear of uncertainity take control over me. I feel bad because I feel like there's a deadline I need to pass in order to become a happy non-smoker, instead of doing it now. I feel sad and scared because I have to check a withdrawal timeline list every day, otherwise I get uncomfortable with what the future might bring.

what quitting smoking (or better yet, not smoking) has taught me, is to let go. Accept the moment and cherish it. Learn from hard time and let them be instead of fighting them with smoking, drinking or just worrying.
It's hard to me at the moment because my anxiety levels have gone through the roof lately, but if there's something I learned from this process is the concept of acceptance.

The First 100

Well, this is the biggest milestone for me so far: 100 Days. I've never been this long without a cigarette since I started when I was 19. I was a pack a day smoker for over 7 years. I cut down to about half a pack (unless I was drinking) for a few more (I'm 31). I'm enjoying being able to exercise without stopping to gasp for air or to put my hand over my chest to see if it's really my heart that's pounding the hell out of my upper body.

I did it cold turkey. I didn't go through Carr's book. The one thing I relied on more than anything was a smoking cessation timeline. This gave me reasonable goals to set for myself. Extra research through [whyquit.com](whyquit.com) was another reliable tool.

I know it'll be a while before I get that smilin' star, but I'm glad I finally stopped. I've beaten almost every trigger that I have and there's no reason for me to ever turn back.

Thanks to everyone on this sub who's given so much support to me and others. Sorry if this all seems so "matter-of-fact" and lacking in passion. My hands are cold and I'm posting from my phone. 

Now I'm off to teach some adorable little kids how to say things in English. Cheers!

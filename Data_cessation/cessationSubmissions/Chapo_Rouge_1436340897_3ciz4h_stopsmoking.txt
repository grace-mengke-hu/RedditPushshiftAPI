60 days in ! Bought this with my spared money.

Hi everyone,

So I'm kinda happy, 60 days in today ! and I just received a little present I made to myself.

As exercising has completely changed my life and helped *immensely* to beat down this nasty addiction, I thought it would be a good time to invest the spared money on some [good shoes](https://imgur.com/nSJv7pB) ! 

[The inside of the shoes has never been more relevant!](https://imgur.com/49z7Kmu)

I wish all the best to all the quitters, all your post have been immensely helpful ! 

If I can share my word of advice it would be : *Don't quit quitting* it took me like 20 or 30 attempts but it's *doable*. Also exercising is the shit, it's really create a virtuous circle.

Have a nice day !

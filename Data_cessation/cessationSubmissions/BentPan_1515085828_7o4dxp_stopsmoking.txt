Day 3 complaining

Stuck inside while it snows. Didn’t have to go to work. Wishing I was smoking cigarettes. Feel vaguely annoyed even though nothing’s going on. Have plans to meet up with a couple friends tonight. Probably going to cancel because it’s only day 3 and I’m just too weak I’ll probably ask for a cigarette, reason with myself that it’s just one, then reason with myself I might as well buy a pack. 

Summer 2016 I quit smoking for 2 months. Felt pretty good about it. Started going to my favorite bar again (one you can smoke in). Didn’t last much longer. Hate the idea that in 10 years I’ll still be jealous of the idiots smoking cigarettes. Thinking about vaping. Is that still quitting? I guess I’m not going to be drinking or smoking weed for a while as they’re probably triggers. I wish I wanted to quit.

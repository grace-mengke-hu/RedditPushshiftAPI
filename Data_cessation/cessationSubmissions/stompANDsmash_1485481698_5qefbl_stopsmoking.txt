4 weeks. Stressful day

I'm 4 weeks without a cigarette.  Unfortunately, I am insanely stressed out.  It's the end of the month so I have bills that need to get paid.  But money is tight because I am in the middle of planning two different trips.  I know that I am stressing out for no reason.  I do actually have enough money to pull it off.  I just hate transferring so much from my savings at once.  It's a mental thing I guess.

I really would like to drink a beer.  But I have been cutting back because I want to lose some weight, save money and don't want nicotine cravings to flair up even more.  I'm drinking hot tea at the moment.

I have been using the patch.  The first two weeks I used Nicoderm CQ.  When I went back to get more, Walgreens had their store brand buy one, get one half off.  Of course I opted to save money.  I had read that store brands work just as well.  But I'm having far more problems with skin irritation.  It's been frustrating and uncomfortable. Makes me want to smoke. I'm going to buy a box of Nicoderm tomorrow to keep my sanity.  

Rant over.  I'm going to continue to drink tea and watch a Disney movie.

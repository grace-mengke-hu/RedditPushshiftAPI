Going on my first vacation since quitting

Hello All... I'm looking for some moral support as I'm going on vacation soon and can perceive that I will be sorely tempted. A couple of the main things that I've relied on to stay off smoking is in developing healthier habits and rituals (fitness/diet) and avoiding getting drunk (only having one or two drinks once in awhile). I'm about to go away and be in a fun/relaxed environment with a bunch of leisure time. I "WANT" to try to to maintain my habits there but historically I'm a bit of a hedonist and am worried I'll pull a "when in rome..." Anything you can think of to help motivate me to avoid temptation? My thoughts are to keep a stock of healthy snacks and simply deny myself alcohol.. maybe also make a point of doing a jog every morning..?

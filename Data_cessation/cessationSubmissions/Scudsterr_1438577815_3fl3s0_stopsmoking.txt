Quite a ways out: A year and a half

I actually at a point where I am far enough away, that I saw for the first time this weekend my brain trying to be like, "Well surely we have stopped for long enough" or "Maybe one wouldn't be that bad."  

It's like you start to forget why you stopped because it's not as fresh in your memory.

The bottom line is that it does actually smell weird now when I smell them, in a bad way, and I was getting annoyed standing in this patio area where there was a good amount of smoking.  I still know how hard it was to stop, and I know what smoking one would be getting myself into.

No ciggs for me!  It's pretty easy most the time, but sometimes you have to be a little on guard!

Any singers that can give insight to healing time?

So my impetus for this quit, and the reason I feel confident, is that I was offered a full scholarship to grad school for choral conducting.  It finally clicked that it's too self-destructive professionally to keep this habit up when others are making such a big investment in me.  

I'm currently at 7 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes.  Vocally, things aren't getting better; they're still getting worse.  Vocal stamina feels like it's getting shorter, raspiness (which used to be consistent while I smoked) is now totally gone some days and worse than ever on other days.  I haven't really started the coughing phase that I've read about in others' posts.  

I smoked 1/2-1 pack a day for 7 years, am a 27 year old male.  Any insights as to when the healing process really kicks in, and the voice regains most of its function?

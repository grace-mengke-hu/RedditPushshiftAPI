Thank you

Hey! So I just hit 2 months cigarette free. I've been following this thread for months and honestly I could not have done this without all of you. Each struggle posted motivated me to try. Each post on here I can relate too. Watching so many people have ups and downs with this really helps me to understand my feelings. I never thought I'd make it this far. So I send thanks as we all try to better ourselves. We do not need it!

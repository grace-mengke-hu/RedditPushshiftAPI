6 months!

I've officially been a non-smoker for 6 whole months!

I quit cold turkey on Sept. 1, 2013, with the help of this sub and THE BOOK. I smoked for almost 7 years and tried quitting several times before with various methods (cutting down, Chantix, etc.) and this is the only time it's really stuck.

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for your support. For those of you who are still struggling, DON'T GIVE UP. You can do it!

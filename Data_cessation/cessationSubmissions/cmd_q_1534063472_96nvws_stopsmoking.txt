After the end of a long relationship, is it a good time to quit or should I wait?

Hi,

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

TL:DR at the bottom

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

Like the title says. I've been in a relationship that lasted about 10 years. We lived together for 6 years. We were both smoking when we met, and I've tried to stop a few times, especially during the last 3-4 years. She is younger than me and she always said she wanted to stop, but "not now", using the fact that she still was in her mid twenties as a reason to not stop (yes, not a great reason, but anyways). I managed to stay away for about a month from smoking before we moved in together. But fell off the wagon when we started living together. It's been a bit too hard for me to stop when she didn't want to as well. I was too weak to resist when her smoking always made the urge that much harder. Perhaps I'm fooling myself that's the real reason, but it doesn't really matter anymore.

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm "borrowing" the guest room at my parents house until we figure out what to do with our apartment and how we are going to live from now on. I have a lot to work on for myself to get through this. One thing is that I really want to quit that terrible habit. I won't be seduced by the cigarettes the same way now when she's not around. At work no one 

is a smoker (as far as I know) and I can go for a whole workday without it. But I always light a cigarette or two on my way home from work.

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

The problem for me is that the smoking is helping me through this in a way (no surprise there, I guess). And I remember what I wreck I could be at the beginning when I managed to quit for a month the last time, and back then I was in a happier place than where I am at the moment.

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

So I'm asking for advice; should I wait a while before I quit, when I feel a bit better (the breakup was 5 days ago). Or is it better/easier to stop now right away and try to deal with it?  Anyone been through something similar?

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

Any kind of advice is welcome. Thank you.

\&amp;nbsp;

\&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR After a long relationship which very recently ended and it's been very rough dealing with it; is is best to stop smoking completely right now or should I wait a few weeks/a month when I most likely feel stronger before really trying to stop?

Resistance Isn’t Futile

I went to a concert last night with a friend who smokes. I had no urge when she lit up before the show but there were points during the night where it was all I could  think about. I thought I was going to fail, hell I was planning on it but I didn’t. I resisted some major urges and I’m damn proud of myself for it.

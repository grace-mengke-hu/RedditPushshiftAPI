Those that have slipped, did you go back to smoking regularly? If so, how quickly?

Here again, slipped last week and then again tonight.
I do not want to go back to regularly smoking. I was doing so well.
The first time I slipped I was drunk then the last two times was just being incredibly stressed.
After 3 months smoke free I seem to have given myself permission to have one or two every now and again. 
Is there any hope? I didn’t want to reset my app the first time, the second time I just deleted it, and now I’ve just reinstalled it on my phone to reset it.
I don’t feel as motivated as I did before. I know it’s because I’m going through some work stress but also I’m just so tired of fighting it. The constant resisting temptation, now the guilt.
I would just love to hear that when people have slipped a couple of times that they have successfully got back on track without going back to their old regular habit. 
The thought of smoking 15-20 a day again is horrible. 
Day 1 again tomorrow. Wish me luck.

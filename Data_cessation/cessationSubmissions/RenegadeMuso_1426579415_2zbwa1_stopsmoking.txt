50 Days!

50 days, and I have not smoked 1000 cigarettes. I have saved R1750 (exchanged to US dollar: $141). R1750 is enough to buy monthly groceries for 2. 

When entering a restaurant, I am asked, "Smoking or non-smoking?". It is awesome to respond with, "Non-smoking please".

Food is amazing! 

Continue the good fight! We will never smoke again.

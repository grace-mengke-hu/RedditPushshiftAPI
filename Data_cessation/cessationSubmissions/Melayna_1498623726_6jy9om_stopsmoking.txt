I've been on vacation. Now what??

Just needing some advice. I've been wanting to quit for a long time, and had three weeks of success early in the year. Let my guard down and was back to my old ways.

Now I've been on vacation for 10 days,  and haven't smoked once. I was a little irritable days 3-5, but feel like the physical symptoms are under control.

I'm coming to this subreddit asking for advice on how to keep this up when I'm back home. I'm nervous about being in my familiar surroundings and falling into old habits.  Should I ask friends to help keep me smoke free? Try gum or distractions? I really want this to be my last quit... any advice is appreciated!

A shift in mentality, week 3

Hey guys, first time poster here! I’m 25 days into my quit and despite week 3 being a lot harder than anticipated I’m really taken aback by my mentality. I have become SO much more positive as a person since getting off cigarettes, a lot more energetic and motivated to be a kinder, better person. I am sort of floored by this unexpected change in headspace and I was wondering whether other people can relate. I only mention this as these past few months I was struggling with depression and anxiety and really hated myself for not being able to quit. I could hardly get out of bed from being so mentally and physically exhausted and suddenly I feel so ... positive? Alive? 

I would really love to hear your stories/opinions!

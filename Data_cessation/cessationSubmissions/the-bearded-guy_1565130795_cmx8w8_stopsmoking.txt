Hey everybody, my first post that I’ve made here, I smoked cigarettes when I was younger and quit after my grandmother died, at that time I was able to replace it with marijuana,It helped but now I’m smoking black and mild’s 17 years later, any suggestions for stress related issues to quit smoking?

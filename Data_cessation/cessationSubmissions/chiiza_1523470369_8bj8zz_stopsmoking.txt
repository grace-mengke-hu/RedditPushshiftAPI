I forgot I was a smoker until I logged into my account.

1 day shy of 50 days smoke free and thought to myself "wow, I WAS a smoker." I quit  as soon as the pregnancy test showed me that "+". This is my second attempt at quitting, the first was  a year ago with 6 months under my belt. Vacation happened and I started up again. I always knew I would stop as soon as I became pregnant and the day i found out was the first day of my new life, smoke free and a mother. It was probably much easier to quit this time around because my mind was so focused on this new life growing inside me and well, the fatigue and nausea from being pregnant also helped.


Thanks for listening and good luck and stay strong friends!

7th day without - my little success!

I know it's not that big an accomplishment when compared to other people who smoke 20-30 a day for 15 years as I've only smoked about 10 a day for the past 3.5 years BUT regardless, I quit 7 days ago, meaning my first week is done!

I did quit once before for a whole month. Stupidly, I decided to treat myself with a cigarette and down the hole I went. Obviously, I'll avoid that this time.

I always find it a scary thought "I'll never smoke another cigarette", it's like I don't want to accept that fact, but the advice to take one day at a time really helps.

Good luck to anyone else quitting, we'll beat this!

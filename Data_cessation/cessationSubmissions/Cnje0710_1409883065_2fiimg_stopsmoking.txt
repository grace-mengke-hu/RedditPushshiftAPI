28 hours Free and going crazy!!

I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and this is my millionth time trying to quit! Cravings are the worst! Craving one now and it's all I can think about!! I really want to quit for good this time for my family, it just really sucks! Lol can't wait for the hard part to be over. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated :)

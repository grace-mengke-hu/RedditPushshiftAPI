Hey guys,
Former smoker here and just discovered this sub recently. Me and my father quit smoking together, I was at 1 pack a day (unless I was drinking) and he was at 2 a day. Two years ago today my dad got a cancerous tumor cut off his liver due to alcoholism and had to quit drinking. We both decided that it would be a good time to kick smoking as well. It all worked out great and today marks 2 full years for us. Looking forward to giving advice and reading your stories. The fight never ends!

Cheers

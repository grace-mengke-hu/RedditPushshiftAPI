Failure. But not final?

So I have been off the bloody things for two months now. Annoyingly, a few drinks with friends have made me fall off the wagon. I'm not now 'back on', so to speak. But is this is now? Have I properly failed? Am I about to go through horrendous withdrawal again? That's what worries me.

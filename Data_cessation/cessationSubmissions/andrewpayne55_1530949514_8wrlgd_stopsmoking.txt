Tried quitting many times, but this time it feels different.

I have tried quitting smoking so many times that I have lost count. I started smoking when I was 13 or 14 and I have never lasted longer than a few months.
This week I have decided to try again and have also decided to stop drinking at the same time to try and improve my mental health. 
I really want to succeed this time and I feel more motivated than usual, hoping that posting in this group will help me to stay motivated.

Question about sleep cycles (due to nicotine withdrawal)

I'm 8 days in going strong. Thing is I didn't know nicotine withdrawal can even affect your sleep cycle. I can't sleep for more than 5.5/6 hours even if I'm tired. Due to the cough and nasal congestion, I sometimes take Nyquil to knock myself out but even then I wake up in 6 hours max. When I wake up I feel either very fresh/or hyper and angry for no reason whatsoever. 

The sleep thing is hurting me because I'm a junior in engineering school and work 25 hours/week. I need the sleep otherwise I'll go insane really soon.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated!

Big test coming up. Your help needed!

So it's my birthday tomorrow and I'm off to Koh Samui for a long weekend (I live in Hong Kong). My boyfriend is coming out from England whom I haven't seen since I stopped smoking. He's a fairly heavy smoker, so I'm worried that the holiday/birthday/drinks/smoking SO will trigger cravings strong than I'm able to resist. Right now I'm pretty convinced that I won't smoke, but we all know how how sneaky and vicious they can be. I guess I shouldn't worry about things before they happen, but any words of encouragement or severe threats are welcome. Also, how to deal with kissing someone who still smokes? Yuck, no? Thanks in advance :)

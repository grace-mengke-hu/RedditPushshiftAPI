Today I'm going to earn that big fat 1 on my badge.

I quit one week ago. It's going to be 7 days today at approximately 23:30, and tonight I'm going to be out with friends, have a few drinks, pub quiz.

I'm going to go out with the smokers when they go for a fag, like I always did, I'm going to watch them smoke, not in a smug way or anything, but sure as not envious either. No reason to stop socializing, going out in the breaks always was the opportunity to chat with some people from the other teams, there's no reason to give that up just because I don't smoke anymore.

It's going to be a fun evening, really looking forward to it. I wish all of you a great day, don't forget enjoying yourselves!

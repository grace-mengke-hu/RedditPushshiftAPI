I ran a mile!

It's been a week, and today I ran a mile in 11:52. I'd taken 2 months off from running due to back issues (waiting for cortisone injections, then recovering from them) so I wasn't sure how this would go. I'm pretty happy with my time (and with my breathing! lol) and hope to see gains from here. Thanks for not smoking with me buddies. I'm excited to see what my body can do now that I'm not poisoning it.

Day 8... had a slight temptation

So today is day 8. I was walking to work and some construction guys were smoking. As I passed by them i caught the scent of the smoke. I'm just now starting to smell the smoke as nasty and uninviting,  but a part of me lingered on the smell for a moment. That kicked up the craving a bit, but I'm holding strong.

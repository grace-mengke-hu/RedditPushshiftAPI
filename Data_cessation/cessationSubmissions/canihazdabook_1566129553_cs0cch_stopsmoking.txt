Nightmares

Hey guys!

So this is my first time quitting for real, not just reducing my number of cigarettes, and it's been 10 days now. 

On that time I didn't have much cravings, only for the 2 times I went for drinks, but nothing unbearable, it was mostly that the thought of lightning one came to mind. 

Problem is, I had nightmares that I screwed up and smoked 3 times now. Is this normal? Is it just a subconscious fear of failing when I'm doing so good right now? 

I guess I'm just looking to normalise this and see if someone else went through it too.

Thank you for taking the time to read!

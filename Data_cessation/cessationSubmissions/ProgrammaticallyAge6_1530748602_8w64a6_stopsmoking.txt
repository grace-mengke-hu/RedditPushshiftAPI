I joined just for this reddit. I'm 10 days, 19 hours, and 49 minutes without a smoke.

This place has been very helpful to me, just reading, absorbing, and reflecting on the similar journeys of others. For some reason, today (Day 10) has been particularly difficult. I quit smoking and drinking specifically for recent health issues, though I've wanted to quit for a long time anyway. I know I need to give it time, but I'm not feeling physically any better yet, which is frustrating. I don't have any close friends anymore, and I live a pretty solitary existence. Cigarettes and booze became a coping mechanism for my loneliness - a way for me to "stew" and think through my problems. I'm repeating the mantra today and trying not to drown in anxiety and depression. Anyway, not sure why I'm posting this, but here it is.

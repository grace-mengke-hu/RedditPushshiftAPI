Fell off the wagon, hope to get back on soon

I was doing really well for a while. Managed to go the whole month of June without smoking, and had maybe 3 cigarettes between July and now. 

It’s been tough lately. My SO abruptly left for school hundreds of miles away, and I’m in the midst of looking for a better job. I couldn’t take it, I caved and bought a pack of unfiltereds. I was so anxiety riddled. 

But I know all hope is not lost. I can do this. I have done this. And I will quit again.

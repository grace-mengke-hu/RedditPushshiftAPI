Working on Day 5 Second time around

Started E-Ciggs last Saturday and have nothing but good results. After only using 2 over the past week, I have decided to invest in a rechargeable E-Cigg so I can decrease my Nicotine intake over time and get this monkey of my back for good. 
At this time my E-Cigg is a 1.4% Nicotine and after this cartridge I am going to a 1.0% for the next 2 weeks. Then hopefully I will be going to the 0% Nicotine.

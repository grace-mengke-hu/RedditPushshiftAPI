After 24 years of smoking, i'm finally feeling good about stopping.

I had a cigarette on Sunday, and haven't smoked since. The best thing is, i'm not even using the gum or patches or anything. I still feel like a smoke about every hour or so, but it's fading.

I've been reading r/stopsmoking a lot for the last few months, and it really has been helping me think about it in a positive way. I've already saved probably $60 as smokes are $20 a pack here.

Just wanted to thank you all for your stories, they have really inspired me to get myself free of these cancer sticks. I hope you are all having a great day. :)

500 Days - Master of My Destiny - Nice!

500 days is sweet indeed!  I smoked for 45 years, for the last 30 of those, _heavily_.  My body couldn't take it anymore.  I quit cold turkey.  The first day was so hard. Then cravings hit hard at various times along the way, especially around 6 months in, but they have significantly diminished now, almost to nothing, but I still get them occasionally. 

The dreams finally went away after a year or so. 

The best thing about not being a smoker anymore is when I wake up and am still in bed, and I breathe deep and free! Breath is life!

What worked for me is just going about my quit one craving at a time.  I would get a craving and then just ignore it.  In a minute or two it would be gone and my busy mind would be on to other things.  Then the next craving would come along triggered by one thing or another and I would do the same thing again.

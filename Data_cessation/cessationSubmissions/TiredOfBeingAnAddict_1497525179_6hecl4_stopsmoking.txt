45 Days | I feel alive! As the addiction fades into the rearview mirror, a newer more vibrant life reveals itself in the windscreen.

Today marks 45 days. I've had smooth sailing for a few weeks. But I'm keeping vigilant because my understanding is that challenges lurk ahead. Nevertheless, I write this in part to remind myself that even if I slip up, I need only get right back on track. Life without cigs is infinitely better in every way. Benefits include:

- I'm healthy now, going to the gym six days a week and actually progressing.
- Mouth / smile is overall more hygienic and attractive. Nevermind the breath.
- Digestion / bowels functioning far more regularly. I also attribute much of this to my new fermented foods fetish but not smoking helps for sure.
- Dating! No one screens me out due to being smoker. This is honestly the biggest one. It's no way to live not being able to date who you want.
- My car is not a disaster zone. This has been helpful for the inevitable, "let's take my car back to your / my place" at the end of the night. If anything, my car interior's pristine condition has been noted as somewhat bizarre. Haha
- Lots more but those are big ones.

I could not be happier with this life change. So much good has come from it. I am proud and want to keep it that way. So I will take it one day at a time. Never a puff!

Edit: re the quitting process, first month was tough. First two weeks hardest. Actually got truly sick in second two weeks (strep throat) not really related but it was horrific, lol, hadn't had it in ten years. Last 15 days have been best of my life I'd say.

Pedal to the Metal everyone!

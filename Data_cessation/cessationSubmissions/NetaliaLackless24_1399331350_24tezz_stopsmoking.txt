Progress report and my experience with The Easy Way so far

I'm 130 pages into Allan Carr's book, "The Easy Way." I was skeptical when I started, but after hearing so many success stories I knew I had to give it a shot before I resorted the Chantix, something I really wanted to avoid. For background, I've been smoking a pack to 1 1/2 packs a day for about 15 years.


I'm only halfway through the book, and every time I smoke I have to force myself to do it. It's such a strange feeling. The effects this book has on your mind is remarkable. I felt bad about smoking before starting this book, but now it's not so much that I feel bad while I'm smoking, just a "...why the hell am I doing this?" feeling. It's so great.


When I read about a quarter of the book, I did what a lot of people who read this book have done. I put it down and found excuses to not read it because I knew it was going to work. I felt like I was losing an old friend and was very difficult. After a couple weeks, I found the courage to pick it up again. Now I know that I'm not "letting go of an old friend," but will be crushing a long time nemesis.


When I've come here for advice in the past, this has been one of the widely recommended suggestions. I was extremely skeptical. I mean, how could a book make you quit smoking? But it does. It's crazy, but it works.


I'll be finishing the book this week, hopefully, and along with it my last cigarette (hopefully.) I definitely recommend this book to anyone who feels they are ready to quit and is trying. It doesn't talk about horror stories. As Carr puts it, why would he tell you about the health and money issues it causes? If you're at the point where you're reading that book, you already know all about them and are well aware of the damage to your health and wallet that you are doing.



Well, wish me luck, guys. I hope to be back here soon with a report on how being a non smoker is going. Thanks again, everyone.

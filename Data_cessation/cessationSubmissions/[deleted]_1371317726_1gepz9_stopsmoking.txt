How Do I Stop the Anger?

I finished "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" yesterday and smoked my last one around 8:15 pm EST. It is now 1:30 pm the next day and I am in such a bad mood. I'm snapping at my boyfriend on the phone etc.  

I am done smoking. But I'd appreciate ANY help or words of encouragement on how to suppress the Nicotene Monster.

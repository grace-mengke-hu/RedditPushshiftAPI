Can I expect ____ to ____ with time after I quit smoking?

Hey everyone I want to say thanks in advance for whatever feedback, experience or advice you can give me in regards to this awkward issue. Basically I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking since I was about 19-20 so its been about 3 1/2 years. I've tried to quit many times and failed however I believe I am truly ready to kick it and so I have today. 

This is really embarassing but I'm just looking for some guidance from anyone who's been in my position. Before I started smoking my sex life was amazing cut and dry nothing short of paradise. Over the course of the last two years it has very steadily and exponentially gotten worse to the point of pure shame. I suffer from ED about 80% of the time I try to have sex and I no longer reach the same size when I can get it up. I'm very young to be suffering this issue which is my main motivation for quitting. I know that smoking doesnt physically shrink a man's penis it prevents blood from circulating fast enough for it to become erect and stay erect.

What I'm curious about is can anybody speak about the conditions of there sex life and to be blunt the size of there penis before and after smoking. I guess I'm just trying to find out if Its possible to get back to the way I was prior to smoking. In other words Can I expect my penis to grow back to its original size with time after I quit smoking? Thanks again everyone and sorry if that was uncomfortable to read.

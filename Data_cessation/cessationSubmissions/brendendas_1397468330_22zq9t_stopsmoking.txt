500+2 days complete.

The human mind can achieve greatness If one has the willpower to change. 

If I can do it, you guy definitely can.


Keep at it, exercise, eat well, read, write, do whatever you can to better yourself. 

**Pros:** 

1. Food tastes awesome, 

2. I can smell everything,

3. Heart feels much much more healthier,

4. Confidence in talking to people has increased as my breath doesn't reek of cigarette smoke,

5. I can run up a flight of stairs without the feeling of impending death.

**Cons:**

1. NONE

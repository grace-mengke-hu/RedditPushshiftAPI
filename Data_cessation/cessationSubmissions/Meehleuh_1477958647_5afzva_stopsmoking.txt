I need help

I quit smoking the 1st of August while on a trip with my best friend. It was difficult as hell, i felt crappy and its mostly thanks to her that i was able to stay away from cigarettes. At one point i was drunk and a guy kept offering me cogarettes and she literally told him she would slap him if he did not stop. She is awesome. 

Cue to 3 months later and i fucked it up. I started smoking joints with tobacco again, started asking people for my one cigarette a day and then a week and a half ago bought a pack again because i was stressed for some bullshit reason. I know its mostly up to willpower and apparently i have none. I'm so sick of myself. Everytime i tell myself its the last one, i can go for one or two days without and then something goes wrong, i have a long plane ride or i'm drinking and i'll smoke again. I'm currently travelling alone for a year so don't have any of my "bodyguards friends" with me to help. Its also quite difficult to stay away from alcohol and smokers since i'm mostly couchsurfing or going out with people that i meet in hostels. I seriously need help.

What the fuck is wrong with me? I really want to quit again but seem to lack something..

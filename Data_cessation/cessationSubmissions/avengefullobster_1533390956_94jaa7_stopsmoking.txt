Having Trouble Getting Started; My Pros/Cons List for Smoking...

I've been wrestling with getting started on stopping. To help myself, I made a little journal-style list of pros/cons of smoking. I feel the need to share it for some reason.. I don't expect anyone to get through the whole thing. 

I could really use some help, but I'm starting to think it needs to come from within.

\-----

**Why Should I Keep Smoking?**

Quitting is hard.

* Sometimes I believe that I like it.
* I tell myself that it’s an integral part of my routine.

**Why Should I Stop Smoking?**

I don’t want to die of cancer.

* My family is predisposed. Brain, breast, lung, skin.

I don’t want to lose my teeth.

* My teeth are already of poor health.

I don’t want to have a tracheotomy. 

I *want* to live.

I *want* to be fit. I want to be able to run long distances. I want to be able to fuck gloriously. 

I am scared of premature aging.

* I already have (many years) on (my boyfriend). I don’t need to look any older unnecessarily.
* I already put some effort into maintaining youthful skin; smoking negates any of those efforts (which psychologically tricks me into not even trying in the first place..)

I would have more time daily..

* If I smoke about 10 cigarettes per day (usually more), I have at least 1.5 hours of my day taken away. During that time I am just looking at my phone and killing myself slowly. The phone is a distraction in itself. I am taking myself away from living life in reality. I’m taking away my presence. 

More presence of mind. More focus.

I believe that I would be able to take myself more seriously. I believe that I would get more things done. I believe that I would progress in life. *(I feel currently stagnant.)*

# I’m curious about how much better it can feel to be alive. I’ve forgotten.

My dad said it would make him so happy if I quit smoking.

Other people would take me more seriously.

I’m tired of living in shame.

* Every time that I smoke, every day, I feel fear of someone seeing me. Of being found out. I assume that they are thinking something along the lines of, “Pathetic.” Or, “Ugh, gross. Get a life.” *I feel them seeing my weakness*. 

I would save money.

* I buy a pack every 2 days, at least. That $9/pack, every 2 days. That’s $9X15 (per month). That’s $135 per month. At least. That’s $1,620 per year. AT LEAST.
* Because I spend money on cigarettes, it opens up a gateway to buying other things. I can never just “not spend money” for a few days. ‘If I bought cigarettes, well I might as well buy something else…’

I don’t know if this is true, but I feel like I have brainfog from smoking. It’s like it converts natural signals from my body into the craving of a cigarette. For example, I currently feel hunger, thirst, but the first translation of that feeling was a craving to smoke. 

**Why Do I Feel Like it is Such a Challenge?**

I don’t know what to do to avoid succumbing to cravings. I don’t feel like I am strong enough. I haven’t found the way of thinking that builds up my resolve. 

Maybe I just hate myself.

I quit!

That's it !
no going back into that abyss now . I am not a heavy smoker . I averaged 6 per day but to me its a very big count .
I quit for 15 months straight (not will power or some thing but it was a result of a shocking incident)
but then i smoked in zurich airport (29th july ) and then it was like a flood. I couldn't smoke less than 8 a day . 
Yesterday I finished "The easy way to stop smoking " in one go! 
I had a hard time smoking in between reading the book as the author suggested . I can hardly smoke the last cigarette. It was disgusting . 
finally after 2.5 months of torture I am finally free!

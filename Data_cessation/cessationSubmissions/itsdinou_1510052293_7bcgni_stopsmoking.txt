Hello pepole, this is my story...

I am 16 and I started smoking on 16. May 2017. It’s 7. November today. I have decreased the amount I smoke from a whole pack to like 3-4 cigarettes a day. Any thoughts? Also I want some tips to stop smoking completely because I smell really really bad and I was busted a few times. They saw me with a cig once and other times I just smelled bad. I want some tips from you if I can get. Thanks❤️

Yesterday night I went out with some people I didn't know. One was a girl who came up and without warning blew smoke into my mouth

Lucky for me I have absolutely no desire to smoke even when I am drunk.


But that was not cool of her. She knew I was an ex-smoker.


Even if I wasn't an ex-smoker it would not have been OK.


If that had been me a few years ago on one of my ultimately unsuccessful quit attempts there may have been a risk of me smoking after that.


I feel so lucky every day to be supremely confident that I will never smoke again in my entire life.

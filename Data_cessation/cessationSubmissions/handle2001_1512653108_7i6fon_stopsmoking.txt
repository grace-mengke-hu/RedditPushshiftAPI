Day Four: Killer Cold Turkey

I quit Sunday night at 22:00 EST and have not smoked since. The cravings have not been that bad this time around, though the mental game has been tough at times. Something I think may have helped me is I decided to go on keto at the same time I quit smoking. So, yeah I haven't really craved cigarettes that bad, but man I would *kill* for a jelly doughtnut. That being said, even though they are way more intense the food cravings are easier for me to resist, and have been a wonderful distraction from the nicotine cravings and withdrawal. I already feel a million times better physically, though I'm still dealing with some of the mental fog and difficulty concentrating from quitting both cigs and carbs. Maybe this technique would help some of you who struggle with cravings and withdrawals. If nothing else, just distracting yourself by cooking (or if you don't cook, learn how!) good, healthy meals is helpful in so many ways.  I'm glad the SmokeFree app led me to this sub!

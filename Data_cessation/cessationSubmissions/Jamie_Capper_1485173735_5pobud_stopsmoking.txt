Starting over.

I was a New Years day quitter and was cruising along, but after hearing of the passing of my estranged father, for some reason I got angry and smoked. That was 6 days ago, and after 6 days where I have smoked in total just under 50 fags, last night I smoked the last and said to myself not again and am starting the quit again. 

It's only been 15 hours but I will not smoke again, like I said 23 days ago!

Former chain smoking booze hound- day 70!!! You can do it !!!!! There is never a good time so start now!!!!!

Hello all. Just wanted to post on Day 70.  If you think you cannot do it, you are wrong ;). You can!   I was at the point where I could smash an 18 pack of beer and smoke a full pack of Marlboros in one session.  The weird thing is I wore it as a badge of honor. How dysfunctional I actually was!!!  I have not had any alcohol or cigarettes and do not plan to.  Alcohol will be reintroduced later but not now. 

Regarding “it is a bad time” or “there is too much going on in my life”.....  there is never a good time to quit.  If this is you, do not use that as an excuse.  It may be you, your wife/husband, kids, work, whatever.    Those problems will be there whether you quit/ are quitting or not.  Get it over with and proceed to a happier more fulfilling life not chained to cigarettes.  

They are not your friend and do not fill a void.  They are an addictive substance that tricks you into thinking they add value to your life.  

Cut the chain. Muscle through.  Keep smiling, stay positive and start truly enjoying your life!!!!

Best of luck and post your progress.  This site is full of amazing support and success stories!

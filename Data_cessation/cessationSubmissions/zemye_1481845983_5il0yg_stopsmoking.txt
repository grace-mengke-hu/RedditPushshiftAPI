Got stressed and smoking didn't even cross my mind

I mean *really* stressed-- just completely overwhelmed, gotta literally drop everything, go to another room and take some deep breaths kind of stressed. And that's what I did, without even thinking "hey, I used to smoke in this kind of situation". Nothing.

And this was a few days ago-- I didn't even realize that I didn't think about smoking until I decided to check my badge.

It does get easier! :)

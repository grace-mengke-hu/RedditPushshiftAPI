I think I cracked it!

After 31 years of smoking I quit 2 weeks ago today. I realised that of the last 60 cigs I smoked, I actually only enjoyed 3 of them. I hated dragging my self loathing around every day. I hated smelling so terrible, so unattractive. My mouth must have tasted vicious! I hated that my friends and family could not make sense of why I continued to put myself at such harm. Right now, I feel free. Free to breathe easy. Free to hug my family and friends completely. I love being smoke free. Good luck to you if you are quitting. Remember how much you hate it!!

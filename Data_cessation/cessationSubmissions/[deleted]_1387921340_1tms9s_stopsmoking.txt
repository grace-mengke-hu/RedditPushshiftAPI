2014 here I come,Smoker will run a Half-Marathon

I smoke cigarettes for almost 5 years,this summer **I wanted to stop,but how?** I started to train for half-marathon(21km) it wasnt so hard cos i had a friend to run with me.I forgot about cigarets very fast,started to eat healthy.Day by day i run more kilometeres.

One sunday i had to run 8km,it was very easy that day,i was fit.After about 1hour and 20min i did it,I felt amasing,happy,like i can run whole marathon,like i can do what ever i wish in life.

I run about 2-3 months every second day.I reached 15 km then my foot started to hurt when i walk.And college started,i started to smoke again...I felt bad,but i was ok becose i tried and becose I saw i can stop smoking.

This New 2014 Year im staring again and i hope that i will succeed.

Really Need Some Advice Right Now

So this isn't really about me.  It's about my boyfriend.  We both had quit on New Years as our resolution.  I've doing great.  Out of sight and out of mind type of a deal.  Him not so much.  In order to help him quit I've bought him the Nicoderm patches (stage 2) and spent about $100 on an e-cigarette starter kit.  He was doing well for oh about five days or so.  Then tonight when we went to the gas station he bought a Black and Mild.  I got upset about it mostly because I'm spending the money to help him quit and it seems like he's not moving forward by smoking cigars or bumming a cigarette off of someone.  So we got into a fight and he's currently not speaking to me.  I admit I was in the wrong for getting so upset but I really just want to make sure he doesn't fall off of the wagon and stays on the path to quit.  Also him smoking cigars and cigarettes in front of me makes me crave so that's another reason why I got upset.  Did I go about this the wrong way?  I mean I know people quit differently.  Is it okay to let him have a cigar or one cigarette every once in a while and am I going about the whole tough love bit too harshly?  Anything that anyone can tell me would help a lot thank you so much.

TL;DR: Spent lots of money on boyfriend to help him quit smoking but he's still doing it we fought and now are not talking please help!

Edit:  Thanks for the comments they really helped.  We did have a talk and like /u/JMD359 said and my boyfriend also said that addiction varies from person to person.  I've agreed to stop breathing down his neck and let him quit his own way.  He doesn't want me to leave because I'm the only one in the house who can convince him to not buy a pack of cigarettes.  I guess I handled it the wrong way but after our talk I feel like him and I can continue on the path of quitting together I just gotta be there for him.  Again thanks everyone!

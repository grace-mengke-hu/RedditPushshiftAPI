Day 2

I'm writing this out more for myself to see my smoking timeline. Currently day 2 with no tobacco.

* I'm 38. 
* Started to smoke at age 18, freshman year of college.
* By the time I was in my late 20s I had significantly cut back. A pack would last a week or so.
* Went periods where I would smoke 1\-5 a day, then maybe zero for a bit, then back again. I haven't smoked more than a 1\-5 for years. I would go a week or more with zero. But always would come back to it. A smoke after I get home with a drink, that kinda thing.
* Recently I would go weeks \(months?\) without a cigarette \(but was replaced by the occasional cigar\).
* Just decided this morning that I'm going to sell of my cigar collection. No more bumming a smoke at the bar, parties etc.
* I'm fucking done with tobacco. Fuck this. I work out. I have a daughter. I like working out. 
* Day 3 coming up.

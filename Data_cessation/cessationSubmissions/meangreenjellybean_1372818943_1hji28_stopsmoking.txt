Just finished day 1 with chantix

I've tried to quit a number of times in the past like we all have. This time, my doctor prescribed me chantix and so far its going really well. I was barely smoking for the last couple of days (2-4 a day) and half the time I lit up, I ended up saying that I really didn't want it. I was browsing reddit and I realized there might be a subreddit for quitting. Glad to have found you guys!

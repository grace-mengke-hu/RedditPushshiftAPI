4years!

First post to Reddit! Ha. 
Today Iâ€™m celebrating my 4 year smoke free anniversary! I smoked for 10 years. I never thought I would be able to quit and stay quit for this long! I still have cravings every now and again but they pass! Anyone struggling with quitting right now, know that you can do it! Thank you to this community, reading your guys success stories help me stay on track.

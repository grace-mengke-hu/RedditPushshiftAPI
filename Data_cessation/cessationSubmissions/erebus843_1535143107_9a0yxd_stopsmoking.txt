How did you start smoking?

I don't mean to get off on a tangent, but I think it's important to understand why we started smoking in the first place. Was it peer pressure? Curiosity? Learned behavior from relatives?

I smoked my fist cigarette when I was 13. Stole a couple out of my dad's pack (Carlton Ultra Lights). Me and a friend went out to a field near my house and lit up. Made me sick. But for some idiot reason I tried it again, and again, and again. 36 years later I'm smoke free for pretty much the first time in my life.

I don't know for sure, but I think for me it was curiosity. Plus seeing my dad smoke probably helped encourage me that way. The irony being he quit shortly after I began and hounded me about my smoking. I reminded him once the first cigarette I ever smoked was one of his. He didn't really have a come back for that.  

So what about you? Why did you start in the first place?

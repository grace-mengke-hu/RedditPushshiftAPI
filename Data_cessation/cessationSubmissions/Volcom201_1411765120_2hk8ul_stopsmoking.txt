Trying to quit smoking by vaping

So for the past week I haven't had one cig at all... I decided to buy a vape and have been using that for the past week... I think overall its been better for my health but all I'm doing is replacing the smoking with vaping. So today, I'm going to put the vape down and continue on week 2. I will check in next week to see how I did.

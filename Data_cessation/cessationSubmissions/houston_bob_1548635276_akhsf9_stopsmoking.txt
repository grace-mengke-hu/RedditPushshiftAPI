I made it 2,000 days and didn't realize until now

I'm at 2093 days smoke free as of this post. I quit smoking on March 3, 2013. That is the last time I smoked a cigarette. I smoked about 10-15 cigarettes a day, starting sometime in late 2007 or early 2008 and continuing until the day I quit. I've saved approximately $11,500, and skipped 43,117 cigarettes. Sometimes I think it would be nice to smoke a cigarette, but the feeling quickly passes.


I quit cold turkey. I stopped associating with people I knew who smoked, for a time. After about six months, I welcomed them back into my life. I still keep a distance from most smokers. I was fortunate that no members of my immediate family smoked. 


Just hold out until six months. It gets noticeably easier after that. Make good decisions--don't associate with toxic people, or people you know will be smoking heavily around you (especially if you're drinking). Don't go telling everyone in your life that you've quit (this will make failure sting more). Buy yourself something nice when you hit a milestone, like $500 saved. Don't go to convenience stores where cigarettes are sold. Cut back on drinking for a while. You'll get there.

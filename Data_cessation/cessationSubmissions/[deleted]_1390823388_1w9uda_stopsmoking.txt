Day one! How can I avoid being a bitch?

It's my first day on quitting to use [Snus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) and I couldn't find a subreddit for it, so if it's okay I'll hang here with you guys! It's basically the same thing as smoking anyway :)

I've tried quitting one time before, and lasted about 100 days, and I have no idea why I started again, it's just stupid. My boyfriend actually begged me not to quit again, because apparently I was a bitch for weeks the last time.

How can I avoid it this time? Do you know any good techniques for not losing my temper?

Extra info; using nicotine patches to get a little nicotine, will be using lower dose every week until I feel I don't need them. Did this last time as well, so it's not lack of nicotine that causes the anger issues :D

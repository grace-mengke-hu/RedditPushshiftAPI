[Pass Along Book] - Allen Carr - Easy Way To Stop Smoking. Please read entirely before commenting.

Before you read - This is for the US only, sorry to the outside countries. This is to save on shipping costs.

Hi Everyone!

I've never did something like this before but I came up with the idea and I'm going to just put this out there and see if there is any interest in this.

Back in 2009 I bought Allen Carr - Easy Way To Stop Smoking (brand new) because I was fed up with chain smoking and going through a pack of cigarettes a day. With the help of the book, and drinking a lot of water, I have a successful stop date of September 16, 2009.

The book is in near mint condition -> http://imgur.com/a/Jg4H0

What I want to attempt and I'm really, really hoping it's successful is that we can start a pass-along book chain for the people in the US that want to quit smoking. So basically what I'm attempting to do is to choose one person to send this book to, I will pay shipping, and then after the person reads the book, they pass it along to the next person.

The person receiving the book will only pay shipping costs to send it to the next person, so therefore if they are wanting to receive the book, they should have enough funds to send it to the next person in line - no exceptions. If you're receiving the book, you promise to take care of it and be gentle with it so the next person that receives it has a near-mint condition book to read.

I really, really hope this happens. This book has helped me and instead of keeping it, I'm letting someone else use it that wants to stop smoking.

If you want to receive the book, be committed to stopping. If you're questioning yourself if you want to quit, then you might want to pass on this and let someone who is fully committed to stopping read it.

I'll let this run until Next Tuesday night - 9/16/14. I'll answer any and all questions you might have.

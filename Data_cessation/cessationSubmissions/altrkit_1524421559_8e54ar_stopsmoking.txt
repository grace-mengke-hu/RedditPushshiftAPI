This is it!!

This is it...im sick of being a smoker. Im now at 1.5/ 2 packs a day. I started when i was 18 years old and now im 35. Allan Carr's book made me quit for 1.5 years in 2014. But i was foolish enough to let my guards down and i started again. For about a month im trying to quit but everytime i go to around 18-24 hours mark i just give in.But now im determined. I just had my last cigarette and now im a non smoker. There are 2/3 things which i want your input in. 
1. I feel kinda depress around 15 hrs+ mark and i just give in.
2. What to do with with the feeling of something missing from ur life?? 
3. Although i had quit previously but i now fear of actually succeding and then my mind starts throwing all kind of shitty thoughts like "what will u do without it?" " u will NEVER get that plaesureable hit again in ur life, think about it", "Oh u r never going to succeed, why torture urself, just have one". I can go on and on about the reasons my junkie mind crafts...how to overcome these thoughts...
I really wanna quit to be a better perso. HELP ME GUYS/GIRLS

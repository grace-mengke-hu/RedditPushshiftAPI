Almost 11 days and I've lost all willpower for everything EXCEPT smoking

I'm okay with having quit. I'm still happy to be smoke-free. But I'm having trouble resisting my old negative coping skills like binging on junk food and self-harm. I feel so disgusting but it's like all my willpower is being used up already. I'm so impulsive.

Will this get better soon??

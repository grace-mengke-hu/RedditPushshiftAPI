I'm scared

I really want to quit smoking because I'm constantly worried about my health. My family has a history of cancer and strokes, and I constantly feel like I have something stuck in my throat, and I always have a cough. 

I'm scared though. I'm scared it's gonna be horrible to not smoke. I'm scared I'm gonna hate life without smoking. When I think about quitting I panic. 

I want to quit, but I'm scared to quit. I tell myself that I like it. I feel like I can't go without it. 

Please help! Tell me it's gonna be okay. That I can do this. I want to have kids and see them grow up, and have grandchildren. I want to live a long life. I don't want to die of cancer, stroke, or heart disease. I want to die of old age, in my bed, surrounded by the people who matter the most to me. 

I want to quit, but I'm so goddamn scared.

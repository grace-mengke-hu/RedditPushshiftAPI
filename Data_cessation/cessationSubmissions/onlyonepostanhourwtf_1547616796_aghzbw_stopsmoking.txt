End of day 2.

I actually did it. Living with a smoker, but i feel like cigarettes are going to be available everywhere anyway, so no excuses. 

Feeling more energetic. Not too short of breath as usual.  Lips are super smooth and hydrated from chapstick,  before they were dry and torn from smoking. I keep my breath fresh using listerine and gum to discourage smoking. 

Gonna keep this up. 

Will post again tomorrow night.

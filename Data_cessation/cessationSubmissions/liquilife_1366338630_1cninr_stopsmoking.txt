Been a smoker for 21 years. I want to quit. I really do. Help?

I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a few weeks and lurk more then I care to admit. I'm 39 years old and am in relatively good shape. I smoke somewhere between 15 to 20 cigaretts a day. 

Somehow I've managed to do quite a bit of running while being a full time smoker. I could do an 8 mile run with my much more athletic friend. I've spent quite a bit of time at the gym working on body strength and endurance. I've competed in 2 Tough Mudder competitions, which are grueling 12 mile runs with 20 obstacles on the way to try and ruin your body, in the mud. I nearly qualified (as in a minute away) for an invitation to the Worlds Toughest Mudder competition. Last I checked I am 39 years old with 13% BMI. It's amazing really, that puts me in the highest bracket for physical body health for my age.

I don't know how, but I have managed to do all this while being a full time smoker. Friends have just looked at me and shook their head. Honestly, I would do the same.

With all that said, it's catching up to me. I can feel it. I can feel the heaviness in my lungs in the morning. I can feel that smoking a cigarette weighs me down. It get's a little bit harder every day. I NEED to quit smoking. But it's hard man, it's SO hard. I've tried to quit before, twice, when I was much younger. It's been over 10 years since my last attempt to quit. But the thought of quitting stresses me the hell out. There are times when I simply am not able to have a cigarette and knowing I'll have to wait another 30 minutes is enough to stress me out. It's bad. I'm scared to quit and I'm scared to continue. It's a pretty awful feeling actually.

I don't know why I'm writing this, and I'm sorry for rambling. I think I just need some support. I really hope there is a day I can see a badge next to my name here. I'm desperate to quit here.

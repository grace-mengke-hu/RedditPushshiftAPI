Almost two months down - I need some serious support and help!

I quit almost two months ago and am now suffering from depression. It's not severe (I have tendency to that), but oh boy, do I crave smoking. I already bought two packs, destroyed them both and this morning I bought a third one thinking "I'll just smoke these and stop".

I know I won't be able to stop. I'm trying not to be too hard on myself; my "disease" is what it is, and after overcoming the worst part it won't be too late try to quit again. I just don't wanna repeat the whole process... So far I haven't really used any spesific techniques. Is there any that could help me? :(

day 38 and struggling a bit.

Hi guys, I am at day 38. 
after first 2 weeks, I've started to feel more easy wrt cigarettes. I've started to exercise regularly, quitting also smoking weed (and bought a vaporizer for that, combustion is not my friend anymore). At one month mark I thought the worst was gone, but this week I have suffered a bit of "depression"/dissociation if it fits... Questioning about everything in life, the reality of life etc etc, so I think also overthinking. 
I have also craved more in this week wrt the whole month cig-free. And have a urge to eat a lot. Eat at every moment.

I think it is part of the journey.  
have a nice day folks!

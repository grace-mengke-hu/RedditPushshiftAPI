Need help coming up with a plan to avoid cravings!

So its been a little over 24 hours since the quit.  major helps has been deep breathing and yoga. I've also had a diffuser going and just smelling pretty smells and deeply breathing them helps so much! I've tried to come up with plans on how to get over quitting. One area that I cant think of anything that might work is social situations!!!!

So I smoked heavily, I was one of the only smokers usually. (maybe there was two of us, sometimes) I realize that I used smoking as a social crutch to get away from a large group and have a minute to myself. I used it to diffuse situations. I used it to pass the time. However I dont know what to do when I am going to be with a large group of people to pass the time or diffuse the situation or to give myself a little break. Can't just go outside because usually we are somewhere where there are quite a few people outside smoking. I feel like an ass looking at my phone.  So what should I do?  I know this is temporary but its a coping mechanism I need now to help!  Thanks for any and all ideas!

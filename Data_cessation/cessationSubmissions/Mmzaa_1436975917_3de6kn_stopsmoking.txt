Day Three, cold turkey. Need some help/advice...

Hey guys !
Posted my [first day experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3d6hk0/day_one_cold_turkey_9_years_of_smoking/) on monday.
I'm on my 3rd day now. The 2nd was much easier than the first and today, I played video games all day to keep my mind off things, less physical symptoms but a lot more irritation.

Today is really hard though. I can still manage the cravings, I fight them off with various tricks (gum and carbonated drinks, tummy hurts but it helps). But psychologically... it's getting hard.

I don't feel like myself. I am so bored. I am a zombie. I can't do anything. Everything scares me, I'm afraid I won't handle new triggers. So I'm home binge-watching The Wire, which is great but I feel like a caged lion. I'm exhausted and I want to cry all the time. This is pissing me off. Everything is. Either pissing me off or making me sad.

Tomorrow I am going to a job interview (scared shitless that the stress will be too much), and then a party (I kind of have to). I was thinking about buying nicotine-free liquid for my e-cig (that I have refused to use so far), what do you think ? Is it going to slow down the process if I keep the gesture, even without nicotine ? 

I know this emotional turmoil is normal on the first week or two, and I know why I am feeling that way. But I wanted to ask you if there's anything you found helpful with the depression... Any advice to stop me from being sad and not daring to move ? I'm sick of lying down in front of my computer but I can't bring myself to do anything else. I have some Xanax that I only use to help me sleep, and some Atarax which is a far less strong anxiolytic. Should I consider taking some ? I'm not really at ease with the idea...

Thank you so much, sorry if I'm flooding the sub...

Loogies after 8 months clean.

Hello everyone, I’ve been cig free for eight months and I have a question about hocking up nasty loogies haha. 

It’s already been 8 months and I still spit up nasty ones every hour or so. 
I had been smoking since I was 14 (now 22) will the phlegm ever stop? Because honestly it’s kind of gross when I’m talking to someone and I have to clear my throat every hour.

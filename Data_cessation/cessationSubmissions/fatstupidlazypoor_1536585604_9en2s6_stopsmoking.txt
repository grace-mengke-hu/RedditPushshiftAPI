Agghhh

K internet frenz..  /r/stopdrinking did the trick for me 1.5 yrs ago.  Smoked like a regular smoker from 18-23, stopped just like that.  In my early 30s started casual smoking with drinking.   Cut it out to very rare smoking in late to mid 30s.   With the quitting drinking it went up.  Started with grabbing a pack when out of town for work and chucking it before going home.  Now I don’t go more than 3-4 days without buying a pack.  Smoke 2-10 of em, grow disgusted with myself and toss em.  Then 3-4 days later, back at it.  Stooooopid. 

So, I’m out, I’m done, and I’m here for internet accountability.  

Luv u

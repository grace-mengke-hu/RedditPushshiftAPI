Hoping that posting here will help.

I avoided buying a new pack twice today. The first was on my way home from work. I only had about 9 left, and I knew I was heading straight to a friends house for a bonfire, which would include drinking (a huge trigger for me) and several other smokers. I managed to sit in the parking lot of the convenience store without going inside, pulled out, and drove away. Later that night, when I was completely out, I drove past the Mobil station in my town without stopping. I'm really proud of these tiny victories, but I'm also scared that I'm not ready. I really hate my part-time job and constantly take advantage of my ability to step out back anytime I get stressed. Plus, about 90% of my friends smoke. I'm just sick of waking up with chest pains and no voice, smelling awful, and most importantly, hiding from my mom. I smoked my last one two hours ago and I'm going to bed now, so I guess tomorrow will be...day one...

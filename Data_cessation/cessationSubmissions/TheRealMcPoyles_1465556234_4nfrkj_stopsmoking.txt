Anxiety after not "smoking" for months

Hey guys,

I've been on an ecigarette for many months now and have cut my nicotine level down to 4mg. Yesterday I was doing a fair bit of late evening uni work at my laptop and had two cigarettes for some strange reason.

Around an hour later I got pretty bad anxiety and tried to meditate through it. It eventually calmed. This morning I woke up with such a muddled head feeling quite anxious. I chilled for an hour and drank plenty of water and ate and it is slightly calming now.

Is this something that can happen with someone who has a history of anxiety when having a few cigarettes after months of not having one? I'm also on sertraline for depression but that has been great for the past few weeks.

180 DAYS FREE OF THE SATAN STICKS

Hello there comrades,

Just last night, I had a terrible dream...  A nightmare that I was smoking the god awful satan sticks again...

But I woke up to an oz of delicious, A+ herb, and 180 days free of smoking.  I've saved nearly $1100 and I don't miss the goddamn things a bit.  To all y'all out there trying to quit, just fucking do it, stick to your guns, get allen carr's book...  I pirated the audio book...  Don't get discouraged if you fail the first few times, these fuckers are designed to be as addictive as possible...

I'm very happy to report that I no longer hack up black mucus when I wake up in the morning, I don't have to stand outside alone multiple times a day interrupting whatever I'm getting done, I have regained my sense of taste and smell, don't smell like dog shit, and no longer feel insecure in front of my parents.

Take a look at middle aged/ older people smoking... does it EVER look like they are enjoying what they are doing, or is it just something the suffering individual is REQUIRED to do?

Fuck cigarettes and fuck old rich cuntbags profiting off of the addiction, illness, and death of good people looking to have a good time.  I haven't had a cigarette in 2014 and it's one of the best things I've ever for myself.  Buy a fucking bong and fuck that dumb ass shit.

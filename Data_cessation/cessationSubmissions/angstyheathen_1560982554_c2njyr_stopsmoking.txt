It was nice to not be able to give someone a cigarette today

I was the only other (former) smoker at work this morning. Not knowing I quit on Monday, my boss asked to bum a smoke. It was a great feeling to be able to tell him I didn’t have any. He was actually thrilled and is supposed to be quitting himself. I guess indirectly I helped him out, so that’s a plus. 

I’m not quite nicotine free yet, but it’s baby steps and today felt good.

Something weird that works for me

So as stated before I was a heavy smoker (35 cigs/day).  A friend of mine told me about this thing her mum (heavy smoker as well) did and I've been trying it as well (day 6).

At all times I have an open pack in my bag. I could smoke it. It's right there. I have a lighter as well. But here is the thing I don't. I have the will and freedom not to smoke it and for once in my lifetime I have a strong will not to do it. What do you guys think is this doomed to failure ?

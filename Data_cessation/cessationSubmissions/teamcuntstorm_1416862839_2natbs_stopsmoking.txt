About to take the leap, any advice appreciated...

How do you recommend preparing to quit? I am down to one cig a day, but for some reason as soon as I tell myself I CAN'T have something, I want it 10 billion times more.  There never seems to be a good time to quit, because I hate the moodiness that comes with it. Any ideas for what could keep my mood stable?

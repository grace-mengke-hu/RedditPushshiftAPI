And it begins...40 mins smoke free

For what seems like the millionth time I’ve quit smoking as of today.  My hemoglobin is extremely high and the doctor said I need to quit or I’ll have a stroke before I’m 40.  I find it easy to quit but staying quit is another story.  I don’t want to go through this withdrawal business anymore...

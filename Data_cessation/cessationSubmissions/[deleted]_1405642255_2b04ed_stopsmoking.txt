Health scare - constant phlegm and coughing. Really motivated to quit for real this time.

Hi everyone

It's so funny how sometimes it takes really worrying for your health to really be motivated to quit.
I'm 19 years old and have been smoking cigarettes (and weed w/ tobacco) since 17 years old. It kinda really quickly progressed and I probably averaged out 2-3 joints with tobacco and 7-10 cigarettes each day over the 2 years.
For the past few months I've gotten this constant build up of phlegm and would always cough up. 90% of the time it's clear mucus (brown flecks sometimes) but sometimes it's brownish/yellowish/greenish. The phlegm is always there and occasionally I feel like something the sticky phlegm is stuck to my lungs and I can "feel" it.
Occasional wheezing sounds and chest discomfort have got me really worried.
Could these be first symptoms of something more serious?

I'm very young and some of you here have smoked maybe who knows how much more than me, yet us smokers never really stop to think: "Why?" It's just so f* destructive.

Only now when I'm really scared for my health do I look back on the past year and a half in which I've been smoking not only cigarettes but joints w tobacco too excessively and really irresponsibly and am really worried.

Don't let your life get taken by this beast.

Enough is Enough

Folks - Casually started to smoke 5 years back with no real craving of sorts. But ever since I joined a high pressure job in finance, with everyone around me smoking, I've turned into a full time smoker with pangs if I go out  without one before lunch. 

I feel a dull pain on the right side of my chest which has been lingering for months. I've decided enough is enough. Im stopping !

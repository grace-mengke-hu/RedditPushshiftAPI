My SO leaves cigarettes at home when he goes to work...

And all I can think is that he had better not waste them for as much as they cost! Seriously though, it rarely crosses my mind to smoke them which is fantastic. I even made it through a remarkably frustrated evening last week without even thinking of a cigarette. I had the same feelings of anxiety that *used* to inspire a desire to smoke but now don't look to cigarettes for a "solution". A month and a week off nicotine and I am so happy about it!

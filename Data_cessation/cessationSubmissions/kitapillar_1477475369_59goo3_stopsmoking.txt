Just had a talk with my kinda-boss that made me want a cigarette

I quit smoking 4 days ago so I'm still so vulnerable.

Before I continue, I want to say I currently live in a country where it is very rude to say things directly, but I come from a culture where it is very patronizing to say things indirectly. 

Cue the head of my department (I'd consider him a supervisor) sitting with me on the bus stop with something to tell me. Of course, he doesn't just tell me, "The students are bored, play more games; don't talk about receiving a package from the mailman in class; I suspect you smoke, don't smoke in your apartment," which could easily be a 2 min conversation.

Nah. This is how it goes: he brings the subject up by asking me a question, gets my opinion, then agrees with my opinion, then slow fades into disagreement, then tells me why I'm wrong, then tells me what the *students* said. This is ALL said vaguely btw. I had to ask him for suggestions to get him to tell me to play more games with the students; I had to ask if the students said something to get him to tell me about the mail, and he spent all this time asking me not to be offended by the fact that he's seen my lighter and smelled smoke on me.

It was a 15 minute conversation. :|

Where I'm from, this is not a tough conversation. It's a *useful* conversation. It's good for me to know that my students are bored, that it's not cool to talk about mail here, and that I shouldn't smoke in my apartment. And I know it comes down to cultural differences, but I feel like a child when everyone here pussyfoots around silly things like this. 

The last part of the conversation was literally him talking about how he knows I'm a smoker. I wanted to be a smoker so bad. I still want to be a smoker but this bus ride is 30 minutes. Hopefully my craving is over by the end of it.

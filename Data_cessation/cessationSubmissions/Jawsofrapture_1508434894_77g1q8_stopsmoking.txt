22 smoking since I was 12

I picked up this nasty habit thinking I was cool, boy was I wrong.

I really got hooked on smoking when I was working nightshift being bored.

I tried to go to Vaping but from what I read is that it causes COPD and it burns the heck out of my lips causing nastiness and it always tastes super bad. So that doesn't help.

I never made it past day 3. First 2 days are easy, boys. Day 3 is nuts.

I smoked a Newport and my hands were shaking like crazy due to the high nicotine in them.

Nothing good comes from nicotine. So very addictive and gross, so many health issues too. 

Let the games begin

I'm on a destructive path and i need advice

Hi there! I know it's kinda silly to spill out my soul here but I think I'm nearing a deadend when it comes to smoking and i need an advice or two.
So, I've been smoking for three years now. Not a lot, but a steady amount of ciggaretes each day. The idea of quitting has been bugging me for a while now, and i was slowly approaching that moment when I was mentally ready to do it. 
Since November 2017 I had some relationship problems, and by the time the hardships came to an end, I've realized that my ciggarete count has increased exponentially. I promised my SO that I would try my damnest to quit smoking. And then, just two weeks later after my promise, my mother passes away. 
Since then, my smoking habit spiraled out if control. Currently I'm smoking around 20 ciggaretes a day or even more. I'm at that point where I'm standing on a street, smoking and thinking to myself "why am i doing this? I gain nothing good from this, I don't want to smoke, please stop!". And yet still, I'm smoking them, like a zombie. I work 10 hours a day, 5 days a week and I don't have a time to workout my internal conflicts, and griefs. I cannot quit my job in order to gain at least some sort of composure - that would leave me penniless. My girlfriend is understanding, and tries to help as hard as she can, but - as egotistic it may sound - it's just not enough.
So, Reddit, please, give me some advice. A book or something. A place to start. A small stepping stone, so I can start my climb.

Sorry if this comes hard to understand - English is not my first language.

Asking for support.

Really struggling to get a grip on my addiction. I am aspiring to be a doctor and a father and every time I smoke I think of my children and my patients and how I'm letting them down. I cant seem to quit the nasty habit. I feel to embarrassed to reach out to friends for help and my close friends are too busy to keep tabs on my usage. I just felt I needed to share my pain. I know I can help this community and reciprocate once I gain some ground :)

Using illness as a chance to quit - help!

I've been in bed sick for 4 days now with flu and have been too ill to smoke. I am starting to feel better but want to use this as a kickstart to the quitting process as presumably I am already over the worst of the physical symptoms of quitting? 

For context I smoke around 15 a day, only in the evenings and mostly socially but it's been creeping up to 20 a day recently so I'd like to quit entirely. Anyone used illness as a catalyst to quit? Any advice? Thanks!

Any advice on stopping smoking?

Hey lovely people of reddit, I’m gonna be 23 next week and I’ve been smoking for 7 years, and I always think about quitting everyday and I have tried at 6 times but I always feel like there is something ‘missing’ from my life when I stop smoking. And I always end up starting again. Can anyone relate to this feeling and what you did to overcome it?

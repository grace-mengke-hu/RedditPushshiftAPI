36 hours smoke free

posted yesterday morning i threw away my pack

i am no longer a cig smoker and i feel 110% more confident in myself because of it. no more am i a puppet of cig companies. they will never get another penny from me!

proud of myself. the cravings have been real at times but i can fight it. i will win this!!

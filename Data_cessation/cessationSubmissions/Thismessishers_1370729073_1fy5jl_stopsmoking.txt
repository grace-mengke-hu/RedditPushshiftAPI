Lapse in judgement resulted in slow, painful decline... some words of encouragement please.

Hey guys, first post here but briefly reading some posts seems to have helped slightly. Well first off I had my wisdom teeth taken south on March 24th and decided that it would be an opportune time to quit smoking (since I wouldn't be smoking for two days) and I did. My girlfriend and I broke up around May 1st but I didn't relapse because of it, though I drove up to East Lansing to where she is attending MSU from my place in Detroit (long distance is hard, on another note) in an attempt to win her back. While I was there I participated in some heavy drinking with some close friends, which I had done since quitting without any problem though my still fragile, warped addict mind used my emotional longing for my girlfriend as a justification to buy a pack. I smoked 7 cigarettes within a few hours (wtf). The next morning while with her I gave her the rest of the pack and returned home without any real desire to smoke again. About a week ago, I made another addict decision while drinking and smoking weed with some close friends that I would smoke that infamous one cigarette to top off a fun evening, well as we all know, that last one never is truly the last one. For the past week I've smoked everyday again with the exception of a day and a half. I need some encouragement you guys, I feel the nicotine affecting my body again, my sense of smell is fading again, and I'm having a hard time regaining my zen.

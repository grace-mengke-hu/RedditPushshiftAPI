I quit 3 weeks ago and I'm constantly clearing my throat.

I quit 3 weeks ago and the first 2 weeks I didn't really cough at all, but this past week, especially these past couple days, it feels like I'm constantly clearing my throat. I assume it's just all the crap that's been building up in my lungs is finally starting to come out, I'm just wondering how long it usually takes before it starts to subside.

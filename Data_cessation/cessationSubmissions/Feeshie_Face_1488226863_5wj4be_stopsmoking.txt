Day two here >_<

I've got e-cigs and fairly sophisticated vape machines downstairs from failed attempt to quit approx. a year ago.  Did anyone have luck using these to get over the hump and stop the crazies?  

I also just downloaded Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" book based on what I'm reading here so I'm hoping that helps.

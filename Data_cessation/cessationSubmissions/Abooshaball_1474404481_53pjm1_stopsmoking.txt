84 Days in. Braces coming off very soon

Hello all! I recently stopped smoking for almost 3 months now. I have braces and I am nearing the end of my treatment. When I get them taken off will there be any discolor? I smoked almost 2 packs a day ever since I have had them for about 2 years. Thanks! If so there is another price to pay for smoking :'(

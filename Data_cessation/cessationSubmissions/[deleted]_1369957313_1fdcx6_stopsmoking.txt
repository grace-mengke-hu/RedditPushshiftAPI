Mouth is in agony, but it was what I needed to pack in the cigarettes.

I think smoking affects people's health in different ways. Some people suffer more with fitness/lung capacity, some people suffer more with skin, I always suffered with my teeth. I'm 20 years old, been smoking since 15 and it's my teeth that have payed the price. Suddenly, 10 days ago absolute agony broke out. Completely out of nowhere, unbelievable immobilising pain. 

However, since then I've not touched any ~~fags~~ cigarettes. I plan to keep it that way. At least as long as I can. I'm sure I'll have the odd lapse over the next few years but this is definitely a new part of my life. I've also stopped biting my nails and consuming as much sugar! 

So unfortunately, it took a great amount of pain for me to see sense. I'm still writhing in agony, waiting for my antibiotics to kill the infection but at least there's a silver lining eh? 

**TDLR; Got a tooth infection, writhing pain, quit smoking as a result.**

Quitters, was there something specific which made you say "Right, that's enough"? What was it?

EDIT: Changed fags to cigarettes, more 'murica friendly.

This is the start of my NoSmoke for 60 Days and I want you to join me.

 

Hello All,

Being a 24-year old guy with an addiction to Smoking, I say let us quit this fucker for once and all.

Last time I quit, it actually went for 32 days with the help of Meditation techniques like Vipassana, etc.

This time, I want to make sure that this Habit gets kicked out of my life for good. Starting date: 22-11-2018 00:00 AM (I.S.T.)

Your support is highly appreciated.  
P.S. I will post the picture of my last cigarette here just to remind myself that this was the last one I am ever going to consume.

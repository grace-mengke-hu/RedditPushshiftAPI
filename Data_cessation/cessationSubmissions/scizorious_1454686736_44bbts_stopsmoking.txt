6 months and feeling great!

Just wanted to post that I am feeling great after 6 months of being tobacco free!

I really couldn't have done it without the support of this sub (when I would feel tempted, would go through and look at the badge numbers of people in the hundreds, thousands, etc. and it would remind me I could do it)!

I haven't had a craving in a couple of months now. A couple weekends ago I went on an ice fishing trip where I was the only non-smoker. I was terrified that I would give in especially when we started drinking (for those who have steel traps for memories, the sober buddy ended up not going because of work so we ended up drinking). Well, sitting in an ice house with three other guys who smoked 2+ packs a day each only made my resolve stronger. After getting home and smelling my clothes, I was so glad I never have to touch those things again!

I had a random dream last night that I started dipping again, but was very glad when I woke up and realized it was only a dream.

Anyways, thanks again everyone! If you are just starting, HANG IN THERE! It gets easier, and is honestly one of the most rewarding feelings you will ever have.

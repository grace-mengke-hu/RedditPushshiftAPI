Day 3, not awesome

This hasn't been a horrible quit, the cravings come, then they go, I'm observing them and not wrapped in the mind fuck of quitting. I do feel like shit today though, itchy throat, feel like a cold is coming on, maybe its the poison leaving my system? I searched on this reddit but didn't find anyone else talking about cold/flu like symptoms during the first few days. Anyone have this? I want to stay home from work tomorrow, but I know I'll just want to smoke. I also quit smoking weed a few weeks ago, so I"m sort of double down on the withdrawal/habit/addiction trifecta. That's all. Proud of 3 days with no cigs, really pumped about that.

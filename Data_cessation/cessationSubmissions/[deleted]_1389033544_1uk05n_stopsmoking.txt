Any experience with champix?

Hi there. I'm pretty fed up of smoking. I tried before and went a whole month until a drunken night out went horribly wrong and I lost my way. I was prescribed champix on the nhs. It was amazing. Really did work and I had none of the side effects that they warn you about (vivid dreams, dizziness, sickness ect)  I was prescribed it again about 6 months ago, I gave it a go expecting the same but it just didn't do anything. Is it a placebo? Has anybody else experienced the same or are there any second timers out there who champix worked for second time round? I guess I'm hoping loads of you have and it was just that my heart wasn't in it. Really want to make that change but feel powerless without that magic pill! Ian

This world is so fucked up. Please help.

Please read with an open mind.

I'm 17. I've been smoking for a some years now. I'm addicted. 

I always found a way to get smokes. Anyone can if they want to. I even found places where people just sold them to me. I knew I couldn't get in trouble for asking, so I just found the right places. 

Fast forward a little, I realised that was a bad decision.

I got a vape to help me quit. I was hoping it could help me quit, or at least I could try to switch to vaping because of the lower health risks. Well, I can't get new coils. Or juice. I'm not allowed in vape shops if I'm under 18. It is more difficult to get vape supplies than cigarettes. So I started smoking again.

So today I'm like ok, maybe at the very least I can look up some harm reduction type deals so that I can be safer. Once I turn 18, I can start vaping again. Then it can help me quit. So I did some searching.

This was the first link: https://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_01_00_saferway.html

I read through it. Once I was finished I was thoroughly pissed off. For those who don't feel like reading through it, it was an article explaining why the ways people try to be safer don't work. And they ended it off with a nice slap in the face.

"And to keep your risk at these low levels, only one method is necessary ... NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!"

Never take another puff. Wow, haven't thought of that. It's a good thing I'm not addicted or anything. It's a good thing I get fucking headaches. It's a good thing I don't treat people like shit when I don't have something to smoke.

All the websites are like that. Fuck this world. It's easy to start smoking underage, but it's hard as fuck to even be safer, much less stop.

I go to r/cigarettes. Gotta be 18+

So now I'm here, hoping you guys can help me. I'm not going to stop smoking until I'm 18. I've already made that decision. I can't do it. I want to be safer though. How can I reduce the risks of smoking while I wait?

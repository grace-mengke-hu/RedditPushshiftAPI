Love and hate, not fear and loathing, at 10 days quit

I love the smell of the cold creek running through the woods near my house. I love breathing deeply when I wake up, smiling that I can. I love not even realizing that I'm not smoking, it's just not something I do. I love the feeling of accomplishing something so momentous. 

I hate that I still get the occasional feeling of missing out, of not being myself. Because I'm the best version of myself when I'm not smoking, and I know that so well that it frustrates me hearing that dying former part of me crying out for nicotine. I hate getting caught romanticizing smoking, and seeing evidence everywhere in our culture why I do so. 

It gets easier. The first few weeks are just practice for the rest of your life - practice saying no, practice with new routines, practice brushing thoughts aside and being conscious. With enough practice, it's easier to slip back into autopilot and go about the day without having to fight nicotine, because it will be vanquished. 

I've got this. You've got this.

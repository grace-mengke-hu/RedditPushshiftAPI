14 days, 10 hours, 9 minutes.

 I can do this! Yesterday marked the two week mark for me, that's 14 days, that is awesome! I went to hang out with some friends last night, I was particularly worried about the temptation to smoke because these are my stonor friends. I thought I would be really jealous of their joints and didn't think I would enjoy the high without nicotine however it was actually way better without it! It felt fun again! I used my dry herb vape, had a little glass pipe so that I could actually smoke and then we used an extract pen which knocked my fucking socks off, haha. Despite being high as balls and having one or two thoughts about smoking tobacco I didn't do it and I feel incredible for it. I have zero reason to smoke now. I'm also really pleased my friends are being so supportive of me, my friend asked if I would ever smoke tobacco again so I asked him why I would and he had no answer to give, that felt good and there was a mutual level of understanding. I feel like I can officially say I'm now a non smoker! 

I made a post when I was two days in and I've been updating there so if anyone wants to read my quit journey then feel free :

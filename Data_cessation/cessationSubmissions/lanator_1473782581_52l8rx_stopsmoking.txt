Have had day one so many times.. Smoking is all my brain knows. Am in desperate need of help and encouragement <3

I seriously don't believe in myself.

I'm 23, have been smoking for 10 years now... I hate it. It makes me feel like shit and I'm anxious about it EVERY day.

One year ago I quit with Allen Carr's video which I found on this amazing sub. I quit for nearly three months and it was so fucking great. 

Then I sort of hit a wall after all that time and my brain did a "just one cigaret" attempt on me which for some reason worked that night. Over the course of 2-3 weeks I was back to being a full time smoker.
Since then, I haven't been able to quit again. I've watched Allen Carr again, it didn't help.

It's like, last time, I did SO good and I failed myself ANYWAY - What's the point in even trying, when failure is so devastating and feels inevitable.

I hate smoking. Every single day I hate it. I feel sick, it gives me anxiety. Recently I've started to set a quit date on a smoking App. I set it at 3pm (my time) today, now it's 6pm and I've just reset it....

I know that quitting smoking takes many takes for many, but that take I did a year ago, was almost EASY and I couldn't even stick to it?

Please help, I don't want to pick up another cigaret but I can't win against my low self esteem and my nicotine addicted brain, that have know nothing else since I was 13. Help :(

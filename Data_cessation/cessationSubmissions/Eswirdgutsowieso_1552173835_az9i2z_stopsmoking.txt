Tomorrow is my Birthday

I dont want to be smoking at 24, but i have a hard time dealing with my emotions without these devils in my pocket.

These hold me back from finding a good girl because i smell like stale smoke. They are staining my teeth. I feel almost completely dependent on them.

I feel it in my bones when i dont have them.
I cant focus when im studying without them.

Really though im just making excuses. 

Why cant i just stop.  At midnight i will throw the rest that i have into the trash.

I feel so unstable. I have a hard time functioning.

Once again making excuses. 

I dont want you anymore. 
You are killing me. Yet i love it.

Wish me good luck friends. Im tired of spending 220 dollars on these things a month. 

I have my whole life ahead of me. 


Please lend me your tips on how to do this.

Thank you.

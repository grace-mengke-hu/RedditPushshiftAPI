I bought a box of nicotine patches from the pharmacy today!

I've had way too many failed cold turkey attempts. I've never even made it past a week that way. I hope these patches will help me. I just bought them 30 minutes ago and haven't put one on. The directions say I need to put it on in the morning of day 1. I've already smoked like 3 cigarettes today. Maybe tomorrow should be day 1? It was a spur of the moment decision, I fear it won't stick as I've had no mental preparation. I was just driving and saw CVS so I stopped and bought them. 


Anyway, what I really need right now are some success stories from patch users. Suggestions? Encouragement? Anything would be helpful. Thanks!

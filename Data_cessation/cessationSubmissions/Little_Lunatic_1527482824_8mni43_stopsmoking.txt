2 days of no smoking!

Long time lurker, first time posting. I cannot believe I've made it this far honestly! This is probably my 15th time trying to quit smoking and it feels like this one is different. I even had a half of a pack still left and I just threw them away about an hour ago. The only change I have noticed so far is that I'M SO HUNGRY!! I find myself snacking a lot more. If anyone has any tips to help with this please let me know. Thank you guys for posting your success stories! It really helps when I'm craving.

365 Days = 1 year

I did it this time. I really quit. I even consider myself a non-smoker most of the time. I still crave from time to time and I still have smoking dreams, but I still finally quit a 30 year habit. Reddit helped me cement my decision. This happened before I was a week in and I promised myself that day I would never smoke again.

I think a lot of it was taken down because the comments were not geared toward the article but instead an outpouring of support from strangers all over the world encouraging me. The post even made it to the front page. I credit the community for giving me the strength to just keep quitting. I don't think I will ever smoke again. 
Good luck to all of you struggling. I quit a 30 year habit and you can quit too. Stay quitting!

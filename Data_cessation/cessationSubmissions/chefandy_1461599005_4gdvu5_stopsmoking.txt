day 1!

here we go! I quit last night and most of my quit hours I've been asleep, but I'm on my way to work smoke free for the first time. 
I'm nervous, but I have a lot on my side.  with the money I save from cigs, I'm taking my 2 little boys to Disney world so it should be exciting!   wish me luck!

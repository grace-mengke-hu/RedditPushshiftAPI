I'm now a non smoker in my dreams.

In my dream I was hanging out with a friend I've not seen in a few years. As a gift, he whipped out 2 cartons of cigarettes. 2 different brands. one for himself and the other intended for me. and i giggled while stating " Sorry bro, i don't smoke any more."

I know it's a silly dream but it feels like an accomplishment to me. and perhaps a marking point of success. Perhaps I'm starting to see myself as a non smoker now.

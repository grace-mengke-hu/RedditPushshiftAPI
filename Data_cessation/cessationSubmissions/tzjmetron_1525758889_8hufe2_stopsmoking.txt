Just quit smoking.

So I just finished my last cigarette and am beginning a new life now. I know it sounds like bravado, but I am serious about it. This post is more like a marker to note the day I quit my useless addiction, and I want to hold myself accountable for my present and my future.

I will provide updates periodically and I have no doubt in my mind that I will succeed in sticking to my decision. Wish me good luck, guys, and to all people who haven't yet quit, go for it!

Cheers.

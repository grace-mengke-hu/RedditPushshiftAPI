I rolled a cig for a friend and still didnt want one

1 week in and have not had any nictotine. I saw a person perform very badly in rolling a cig and I offered to do it instead.

This might seem like nothing to some people but this was a big deal for me.

For over a decade I would either roll a cig for me or for me and someone else. My brain was trained to roll and then ALWAYS smoke after.

The simple fact that I was out last night, rolled a cig for someone, and didn't even want to smoke after was a big deal for me. It really did show that going cold turkey is working.

As a huge bonus to this all, i looked after the tobacco, skins and lighter for the rest of the night and didn't have sneaky one. It just remained in my back pocket and I actually forgot it was there.

As a 8-12 cig-a-day guy going cold turkey for a week, I never imagined I would behave like this.

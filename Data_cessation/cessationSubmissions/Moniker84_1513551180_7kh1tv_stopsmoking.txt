I'm not quitting. I quit.

It's crazy.  I thought I'd smoke forever.  I really did.  We are all going to die some day anyways. Enjoy life. That was always my way of thinking.
  
Now here I sit on Day 66..( I had to get out a calendar to figure out the days.  I don't keep track anymore.)
  I should actually be at 4 plus months but I slipped and went back to it for a couple days.  I decided to be really accountable for it so I reset my clock.  
Smoking feels like such a distant memory. Something that I used to know.  It's like the past 17 years I spent as a smoker was a parallel life.  I don't even want to smoke at all. 

I just spent the past 48 hours with my best friend. I haven't seen her since I quit.  She smokes and I went out with her each time she went out.  
Never once did I even have the urge.  This morning we had coffee and bullshitted like we've done for 20 plus years.  We always had a cigarette and smoked a joint.  Today she had her cigarette and I didn't even think twice about it. Well besides thinking it really does stink.  

Since my husband has also quit we don't have any trace of cigarettes or butts at our house. It was weird to see butts in the trash on the porch today.  As soon as she left I took it to the dumpster. LoL
 
That chapter of my life is done forever and it feels so frickin good.  I no longer say I'm quitting  or trying to quit. I'm passed that.  I Have quit. I Do Not smoke! 
I get such a tremendous sense of pride when I get to say I am a non smoker.  Never again will nicotine control me.

Runners who still ran while smoking: how much better does it get once you quit?

Ignore my badge; today is day 1 (again). I am currently in the best running shape of my life (AND smoking almost a pack a day). I am training for my next full marathon, and I have finally decided that enough is enough. 

So tell me: how much better did your running get after you quit? I need some motivation.

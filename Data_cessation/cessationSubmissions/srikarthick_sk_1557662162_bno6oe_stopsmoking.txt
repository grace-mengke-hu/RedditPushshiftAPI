Do smoking affects skin?

Some of my friends said to me that i look little old rather to my age
I am guessing its because of smoking?
And also i can't able to do more workouts in gym
I want to quit smoking only for this two reason
If i quit smoking today how long it will take to get back to normal skin and energy?

You do not need that cigarette.

Hey all just a reminder you do not need that cigarette no matter what your brain says. 

43 days in and my brain kicked my ass yesterday with what felt like cravings all evening lasting for hours at a time. I did not give in. I was close, I ended up walking to the shops but I just brought and demolished some chocolate instead. 

Stay strong!

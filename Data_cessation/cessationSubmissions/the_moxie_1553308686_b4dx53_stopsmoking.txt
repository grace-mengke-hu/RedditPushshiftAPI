Quitting can be easy too

I am almost two months cold turkey, and I feel and act like a non-smoker now. And I’ll say at the outset of this that I’m just one person. But I just wanted to say to those who are thinking of quitting, and are scared of failing, or afraid to try because of what you believe may be unavoidable misery ... for me, and others, it wasn’t like that.

I quit after 35+ years of about a pack a day, cold turkey, and it’s been ok.  I had never tried to quit before.  I thought I liked smoking, felt ok, and have a rebellious spirit by nature. But then I decided it wasn’t enjoyable anymore, that I was a slave to it.  I read Carr’s book out of curiosity and I just stopped. I can think of many things that have been harder and made me feel worse than quitting smoking. No relapses, no cold sweats, no crying. I always believed it was horrible to quit, that’s what I had been told.  But I’d just say hold open the possibility that it won’t be - I’m proof that it doesn’t have to be.

I’m proud that I did it, it’s a big deal and I don’t take it for granted. My addict brain still puts a thought in my head of ‘wouldn’t a cigarette be nice?’  But I answer the question as a no, think of how much better my world smells every day, and move on.

This isn’t to say that people’s struggle isn’t real, and it might be that way for you too. 

But it could just as easily be like it was for me.  NOT terrible.

I've lost count of what try this is....

anyway I'm back and i found this site useful - but only useful if I'm active and use it when i have a craving.  Its got to the stage where most people think I still dont smoke since March, i pretend im a nonsmoker at parties and manage relatively easy.  I dont smoke in front of my boyfriend anymore.  so really its just work mates that know.  i've got 2 weeks supply of champix and im going to start Allen Carrs book again tonight.  i have one cigarette left that I'll have later on the way home from work.  Here we go!!!

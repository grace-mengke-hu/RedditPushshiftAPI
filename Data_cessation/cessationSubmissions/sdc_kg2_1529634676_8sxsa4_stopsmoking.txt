Switching from lozenges to the patch...(A random, soft-core rant apparently)

Ok, I've been on the 4mg lozenges for almost a month, and I can see the hurdle I'm facing next.  Switching to the 2mg lozenges just makes me eat them faster; my intake of nicotine doesn't change much.  Soooo, I thought going from the 4mg lozenges to the 21 mg patches, and then using the patch stepdowns in a timely manner might be a better way to wean off.  I'm paranoid and work in a hot and hectic environment, so I've got the patch under an ace bandage, paper tape over the clips so I don't lose them, all that jazz.  Actually, that's extraneous detals...

Anyway, here's what I'm feeling.  I'm used to feeling 'jazzed up on nicotine' with the lozenges.  Heart beating fast and all that.  Switching to the patch, I feel *nothing*. Not jazzed, not craving, nothing.  Like the addiction just vanished.  Which is good, but the lozenges left a void I'm struggling with.  Wake up, pop a lozenge!  Break time?  Spit it out, eat, pop a new one!  The feel of the little canister in my pocked, the rattle that makes me sound like a plastic cowboy when I walk, the mint flavor, feeling it there under my tongue.  I'm missing all of that.  I just started patches this morning, ripped it off and went back to the lozenges mid-morning, took a shower and went back on the patch after work.

I know getting over the tactile needs the lozenges gave me is something I need to get over.  Part of the point, really, but damn its a strong pull!  I wish I could find a mint with the same flavor / general shape of the lozenges, but the stand-ins I've tried so far aren't up to the task.

Ah, well.  This has been more of a rant than anything I guess.  At least the battle seems to be between patches and lozenges, and not lozenges and smoking like earlier!  It's the weekend for me now, so I've got a few days of less stress to acclimate to the patches before work comes around again.  Stay strong, guys!  See you tomorrow!

Count me in. 24 hours down.

I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. 


I kid, mostly. I've wanted to quit for a while now but I'm at the beginning of a ton of dental work and got two teeth out yesterday, two more out this week, so it just made sense to go for it now and have an actual physical reason to avoid smoking at all costs.


Still sucks. I did not want to smoke all day and it just hit me about a half hour ago that I should smoke NOW. I kept busy all day until just recently so it caught up to me. I have braces so I can't chew any thing or eat any candy, nuts, etc. to distract. Right now my mind is trying to rationalize that no one should quit any habit cold turkey and that it's OK to smoke *just once* a day. It's gonna be a long road.

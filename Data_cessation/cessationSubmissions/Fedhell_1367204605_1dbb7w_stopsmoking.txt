Ive made it over 2 days now! Alot easier then I expected.

After reading Allen Carrs book about EASYWAY I now know that my quit will be easy as hell. Besides a small pang yesterday, ive been 100% happy not smoking. 

This page of his book is one of my favorites, if your curious about the book check this out, I recommend you buy the book best read ever.

7 days without a cigarette.

I remember the last time I did this I went cold turkey.  That was 8 years ago. Didn't work out.  This time I have help from a cheap vape (not sure if vape posts are allowed here). 

Same thing happened, coughing up all the tar first few days.  I smelled bbq wafting in from my window today and was floored by it.   Ate a strawberry and realized I had forgotten the taste. Manager offered me gum at work even though it is prohibited and said "I will support you."

Don't know where else to post this so here we go.

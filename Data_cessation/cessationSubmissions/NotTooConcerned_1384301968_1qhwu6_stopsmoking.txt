Almost 4 months... Again...

I'm reaching the point where smoking isn't a daily thought, but it would be if I let it.  Over the past 11 years, I've quit for 6 months + twice already, a year once, and one or two months about  6 times.  I've always gone back due to getting into a social circle I enjoy (have moved frequently for work).  For the next 10 months I'll be without my friends from home and am having little to not issue no smoking.  I came to Germany without quitting or the intention to, but after about two months of smoking everywhere, I decided to stop.  

This lasted for a Month, then I had a business trip to Munich, where I saw people I thought I would never work with again, and was told potentially nice things about future opportunity.  We drank a lot, I smoked.

Now is almost 4 months after that, without another cigarette.  I have since visited home in the US, and have spent a weekend at my old rental house, where my friends now live, and did all of the usual things, but made that effort to not smoke for the two days I was there (successfully).  Since then (~1 month), I'm having issues again.  I still have the remnants of the pack I "quit" from something like 5 or so months ago so I can know they're somewhere in the house and say "fuck you" (I don't know where it is), it isn't hidden, just clutter.  

I work from Home, and have no outside smoking pressure besides when I return to the US in a year.  What's the best way to stay without?

Thanks!

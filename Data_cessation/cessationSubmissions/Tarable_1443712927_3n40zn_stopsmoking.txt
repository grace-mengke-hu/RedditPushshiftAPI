An Amazing Year

So, I'm posting a tad early.  That's because this weekend is going to get pretty hectic, but I wanted to share about my one-year smoke free.

Firstly, I never thought I'd be doing this.  Smoking is by far the hardest thing I've ever quit, and yet the most rewarding as well.  I'm not going to lie...I still have cravings; however, they do go away.  The coolest thing is being able to go engage in an activity and not have that pervasive "where can I go sneak a cigarette" nagging thought.  I just enjoy what I'm doing.  I enjoy being engaged in the situation and with the people I am around.

Lastly, and this is purely coincidental timing how this happened, I am running my fourth half marathon this Sunday on my one-year quit date anniversary at the Spirit of Survival race.  It's pretty serendipitous.  Subsequently, I will be running my fifth and sixth half marathons later this month.  Had anyone told me a year ago when I still a smoker that I would be doing this a year later, I wouldn't have believed it.  I was never a distance runner until I decided to quit smoking and begin the couch to 5k.  

I've made some amazing friends in the local running community, and I stay strong with their support.  The way I stay a non-smoker is by doing things that surprise myself.  I've taken chances, and it's awesome.  Don't be afraid to take a chance on yourself.

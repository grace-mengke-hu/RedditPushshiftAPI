Slip up, feels weird!

Hey :)

So I'm quite far into a quit and haven't wanted to smoke at all, and then I was out for New Years with my girlfriend and I smoked a few cigarettes when I was really drunk.
I thought nothing of it because I was hammered and I didn't want to smoke again after that, and then I was cleaning the bar I work at yesterday and found a cigarette someone had left there. For some reason, I decided to try it sober. The first drag I was like "oh crap, I'm gonna be a smoker again" and then it was boring and gross and I felt woozy.
I told my friend when she got into work and she offered me another one and I smoked another 2 with her. I didn't enjoy or really want either of them!

I think it was kind of a build up of being around a new girlfriend who smokes and I've been really healthy diet wise for a couple I months and enjoying that too but I think my brain just or sick of being the boring person who says no to everything!

I don't know how to deal with this but I know I won't smoke any more. I was stopped in my tracks by a) not wanting it and b) remembering how sad it would make my dad if I smoked again.

I'm done, I just need to know how to stop myself feeling like I'm being boring or somehow denying myself (from something I don't want) by constantly saying no to everything!
I think everything just used to be so easy and now I'm thinking about everything and it's weird for me!

Oh and before New Years I smoked blunts a couple of times with my girlfriend so I could join in without having tobacco!

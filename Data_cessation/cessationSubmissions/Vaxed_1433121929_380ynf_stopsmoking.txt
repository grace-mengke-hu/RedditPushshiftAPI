I was offered a smoke today, I was tempted but remembered how I quit and my tips to smokers

I'll tell you it was far from easy to quit. 

Cold turkey - didn't work. The patches - didn't work. The pills - didn't work. The gum - didn't work. 

I'd grown up around smokers and had smoked from when I was 14 until my mid 20's. I was fit, in shape and felt like I was in good health so I pretty much ignored the fact I was killing myself.

Finally, the way I stopped (and I wouldn't recommend this as an effective treatment) was by having a massive heart attack at 25. A good job, two young kids, a beautiful wife, two new cars and a house totally paid off (coincidentally paid off from an inheritence me and my wife recieved when my father and my mother-in-law passed away only months apart, both in their 40s, both from lung cancer). Life was going fantastic for us, until I was short on breath while playing catch with my boy. The next thing I knew I was being rolled into surgery in the ER. Other than my habbit of over two packs a day (and don't take that as "Oh, I don't smoke THAT much, I'll be fine!" - one is enough) I was in perfect health and had everything going for me. 

My advice, though harsh : If you want to quit but nothing seems to work, it means you don't really want to quit. So just wait around, maybe you'll learn your lesson when you see your family crying their eyes out while you get wheeled away to surgery, not knowing what's to come.

What ever you do though, stay strong. There are people who love an care about you who want you to do the best you can. You CAN do it, it just takes time!

Smoke free and happy to be!

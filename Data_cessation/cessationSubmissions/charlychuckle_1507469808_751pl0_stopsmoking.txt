The Line must be drawn here! This far, no further!!!

I have smoked for 16 years now. I am sick of it. THis morning I woke up, after a heavy night of drinking and excessive smoking. My mouth tastes like a fucking ashtray. My clothes smelled horribly smoky. This is it. Today I stop smoking. Cold turkey. Fuck it.

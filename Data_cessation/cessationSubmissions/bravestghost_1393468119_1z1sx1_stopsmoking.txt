Need help with the mood swings!

Does Anyone have advice with mood swings? I've tried both cold turkey and replacement therapy and I hate how moody I become towards everyone around me. I'm a huge prick to friends and strangers alike. I've just found it easier to smoke. I quit with pills a few years ago but that only lasted a few weeks after the prescription ended. Short of locking myself in my room for a month, what do you guys do? I'm sick of feeling like the biggest asshole in the world?

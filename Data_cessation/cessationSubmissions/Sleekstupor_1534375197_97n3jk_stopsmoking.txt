Issues with Anger?

I'm trying to quit (again). One of my biggest problems with quitting is how it affects my anger: I'm already pretty hot-headed and I do a fine enough job of keeping it under control. But whenever I quit smoking, it gets way intensified. Like, Donald Duck-level freakouts. I currently have a new job that I really like, but I'm afraid to quit because I'm afraid of how it would affect my temper.

To anyone with a similar temperament: how did you cope? Especially in the moment at work pr somewhere where you couldn't just get up and go for a long walk.

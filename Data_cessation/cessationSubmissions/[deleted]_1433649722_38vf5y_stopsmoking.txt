The Absurdity of Addiction â€“ Anyone Care To Share Their Rock Bottom Stories?

Title says it all. Anyone care to share their most ridiculous moments of addiction? The moments so absurd you have to stop and wonder what the f**k you're doing?  

My personal lowest was at a time when I was completely broke after loosing my job. I had recently told my family I was quitting smoking, so I hadn't had a cigarette in a week and I was going crazy. One day when my family was gone I ransacked the entire house looking for change to buy a pack. Once I'd found enough I walked a full mile to the closest CoinStar machine (a kiosk where you can exchange coins for paper money) to get some cash because I was too embarrassed to pay for my pack with change. After getting the cash I bought my pack and walked another mile back home. I had time to smoke two before I thought my family might come home. So I smoked the two cigarettes and then had to go and shower to get rid of the smell. I spent the next few days sneaking out to smoke when my family was gone. Each time I felt like I had to shower just to make sure they couldn't smell the smoke on me. I was so ashamed of myself. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to quit for a year after that. But I still consider that day to be the day I realized how much power these little buggers have over my life.

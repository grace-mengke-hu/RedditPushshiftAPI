Two days smoke free, feeling MISERABLE AT BEST. [24]

I see a ton of posts on here saying "I'm having a GREAT FIRST DAY not smoking!", and I really want to feel that way.  But I'm irritable, my mind is foggy, and there's a little metaphorical demon sitting on my shoulder constantly nagging me to go have a smoke.  And I can't shut him out.

I've been a smoker since I was 13 at military school.  All I've ever wanted is to be done with the stuff since I was about 20.  But I can't muster up the willpower to just say NO.  I need help.  Tell me I'm going to make it, or how you managed to do it.  Tell me when it get's better, and that it's worth it.  Please.

Any ideas on what to watch?

I've been trying to read Alen Carr's easyway,but i always stop at 40,50 page and than I just lose the will to read. Are there any videos that might help me because Im sick of smoking but i feel it's dragging me everytime I try to quit it's like this fucking wormhole inside my stomach screaming for nicotine. I really want to quit, i just dont what kind of methods to use

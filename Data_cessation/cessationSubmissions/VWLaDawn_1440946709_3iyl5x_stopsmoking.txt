I was the "Non-Smoker" yesterday and it felt goooood!!!

I was at a little kids birthday party yesterday and when it was cake time the parents were scrambling around looking for a lighter to light the candles. They both looked at me and said "oh wait you wouldn't have one you don't smoke anymore." Yeeeessss!!! I have been waiting to hear those words for so long. So they both turned around and literally said "well we have to wait to light the candles cause the smoker just went outside to smoke her cigarette and noone else carries a lighter". I am no longer "The Smoker" and it felt greeeaaaat!! I even did a happy dance. (After they turned away of course, not sure anyone else would have understood) I wasn't the one holding everything up, I wasn't the one that you could smell walking into the place, I didn't have to run outside after we ate because...that what ya do, I wasn't the one with the lighter and I wasnt "The Smoker"!!
Anyway it was so good and refreshing I felt I just had to share. :)

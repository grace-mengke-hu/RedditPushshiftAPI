100 days and so happy!

Free. Free. Free. So happy! Out of curiosity I handled a cigarette the other day that was unlit. It was kind of odd and it didn't bother me. Then I  smelled it up close and gave a good sniff. I gagged. Not an inkling to go back. Keep going everyone. It gets way easier, promise.

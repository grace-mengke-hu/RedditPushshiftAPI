This is how I quit.

It took me several times to quit using different methods, but what really helped me the most and helped me quit now for the last year and a half is chantix. Its a great medication, but there are side effects that they don't know about yet. After taking it for about 3 months I had very serious stomach problems for 6 months after, which I eventually cured by staying on an anti acid. Also I haven't started to really enjoy life until quite recently. Don't let it discourage you though, as far as I'm concerned the ordeal I went through using this medicine was better then smoking for the rest of my life.

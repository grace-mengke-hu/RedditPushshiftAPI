Let's have a Reddit party for /u/my_vape_self !!!

*checks everyone has a full champagne glass*

*taps spoon on glass and stands up*

I think it's safe to say that this is a gentleman who has been very influential in a lot of peoples' quits, and today marks a year since he quit nicotine altogether. I doubt there are many of us here who don't know who he is, as he's always here to provide insight and words of support. So, let's celebrate a full trip around the sun without smoking for /u/my_vape_self !!!!

*drinks champagne*

*switches the music on - celebration by Kool and the Gang*

With a year of hindsight it was actually easier then I though.

So 1 year and 1 day ago today I had to go to the hospital because I had a pulmonary episode and my rescue inhaler wasn't working. It was very expensive and made me feel really stupid for doing it to myself. 

I didn't read Alan Carr, I didn't take pills, I put down the tobacco (and other smokable items) after 15 years and haven't touched them since. Honestly the first month or so was a living hell. I flipped out on my best friend at the time (haven't spoken really since), Went nuts on my birthday shortly after and in general was really depressed for three weeks. Then like magic almost exactly three weeks to the day of quitting it cleared up and it seemed like there was a different person acting in my shoes. I didn't have the experience that many of you guys report though about instantly being able to run miles after quitting. It has taken this entire year of slow progress to build up my cardio to be able to go for a long bike ride. And I'm a skinny guy.

Overall though transforming that 1 day star to the smiley face wasn't so bad. It got easier every day and now at this point I can't see myself going back. Even if I failed a job interview, got dumped, evicted and my cats died all at the same time I doubt that I feel like a cigarette would actually make me feel better. Actually I don't just doubt, I know it won't. 

So good luck to all you out there. It is worth it.

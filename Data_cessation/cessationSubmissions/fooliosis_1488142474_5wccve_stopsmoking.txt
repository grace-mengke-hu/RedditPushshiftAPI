9 weeks cold turkey

First time I have quit and it has stuck. 
If it helps, I have been trying to trick my brain to think they are gross and disgusting- as in when I smell them I privately talk to my wife or a friend about how they are "so gross. Yuk. Who even does that, it's super disgusting!!! P-U!!! " like I was back in middle school. It's been helping me. Good luck all of you.

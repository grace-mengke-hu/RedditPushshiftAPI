I smoked BUT..!

Yesterday i was in a party, everyone were smoking so i smoked 3 cigarettes after nearly 2 weeks. 
I just want to say that it ok, yesterday i felt it like a 'battle lost' mostly for the alchohol maybe. But today i woke up and everything was fine. 
Hey, it's ok to be weak sometimes, we are human and this is a big addiction we started to quit.
Don't worry, everything will be fine if you believe in it, i decided to do it.

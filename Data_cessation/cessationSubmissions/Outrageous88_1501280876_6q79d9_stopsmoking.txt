My quit day is August 1 || Looking for advice

3 more days of these cancer sticks. I have been "mindfully smoking" for the past few days, and this has really helped me prepare myself for the big day. Actually smelling, tasting and feeling the smoke enter my body has been a huge help. I decided to quit mainly for my health, but also to save money and not smell like a walking ashtray. I am 28 years old, and have been smoking for a long time, more than half my life. 

I have been a pack a day smoker for about 12-13 years, stealing smokes when I could before then. I have tried to quit before. I tried multiple times, and the biggest success I had was quitting cold turkey for 3 weeks when I was 19. I started back because of stress and honestly, I wasn't prepared for the long term journey that is 'becoming a non-smoker'.

Since then I have only entertained the idea and would mildly research the net for help and tips. Then I called 1-800-quit now, which will switch you to the proper state--I talked with a quit coach and was offered free Nicotine patches. Reluctantly, I set my quit day for Aug.1, that was two weeks ago. 

Not going to lie I am nervous, scared and a little worried. However, I feel like I am more prepared now. I realize that in posting this here as a current smoker I may be breaking some rule, or moral code, but I just wanted to go ahead and introduce myself and get my internet support lined up. Three days will go by fast.

I feel confident, granted I haven't taken the plunge yet. I also look forward to documenting my journey here and reading all of y'alls. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for any knowledge, advice or experiences you may provide.

3 years smoke free

Nothing much to say, but yesterday marked my 3rd year smoke-free, and the best part about it is that I had forgot completely about that milestone until I was reminded of something else.

For those in the early stages of quitting, let me say this: The best part of the process is giving smoking the worst fate possible....to be ignored.

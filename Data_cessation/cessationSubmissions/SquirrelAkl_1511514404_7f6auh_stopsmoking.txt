Change in sleep quality, vivid dreams (not nice ones).

Hi all. Today it's been 1 week not smoking for me - yay! I feel better in lots of ways, particularly going for a hilly walk after work today and not getting out of breath nearly as much as I used to.

I've had terrible sleep quality this week though. Usually I get 7.5 hours sleep with around 4 hours of deep sleep, and I never remember any dreams. Now I'm getting about the same amount of sleep, but only about 2 hours deep sleep and having strange, sometimes scary and disturbing dreams that wake me up. 

Does anyone else get this? I don't know whether it's the Champix I'm taking (called Chantix in some countries, I think?) or just the change in oxygen levels / chemicals in my brain. Any idea? How long before this passes? Thanks!

100 days nicotine free, 1000 cigarettes not smoked, 300 dollars saved, 2 days worth of time not spent smoking, and 2 additional days added to my lifespan. Thank you StopSmoking!

Coming here every craving in those first 2 weeks was crucial. I see myself as a nonsmoker now. One tip for those who have a hard time not smoking and drinking - try a nicotine free e-cigarette. Kept me sane and smoke free while not hampering my "fun", sometimes I don't even need it, but carry it as a fall-back. Good luck friends!

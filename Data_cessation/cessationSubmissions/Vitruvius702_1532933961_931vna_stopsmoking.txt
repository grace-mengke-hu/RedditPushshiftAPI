Day 6 - Random Thought

I quit six days ago. Tomorrow will be a full week!

The last time I legitimately quit for any significant amount of time (a year) I had these same thoughts, but I had forgotten about it until now.

One of the most accurate ways of assessing how well I'm recovering from the nicotine addiction is by how long it takes me to remember that I have quit/my first craving of the day.

Yesterday my first craving was at around 1.5 hours after I woke up.

On days 1-3 I remember remembering within minutes.

Today was the best yet. I had completely forgotten about quitting for just under 3 hours! That means I spent the first three hours of my day completely not thinking about cravings or quitting or anything! Like a person. Who has never used nicotine.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Day One, Labor Day 2016

So until recently, i was quit for about a year.  I stopped cold turkey and don't remember it being that difficult.  After that year i would occasionally have a cigarette, maybe one every couple months.  I recently within the last few weeks started taking a friend to and from work that is a chronic chain smoker annnnnnnnd i started again.  With the cigarettes come back my anxiety, my breathlessness, etc. and i really cant afford it.  So right now im saying hell with it and im quitting today.  Problem being, i tried to quit last week and holy hell, i did 1 day and dont remember it being that hard!

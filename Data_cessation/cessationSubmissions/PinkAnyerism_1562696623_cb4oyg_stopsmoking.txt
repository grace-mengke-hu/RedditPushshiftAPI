Day 4 and everything is changing

My roommate moved out yesterday, my son is at his father's for the month and my work schedule just changed from evenings to mornings. I am still going strong and do not have the desire to smoke but dealing with all the stress and anxiety of so much change at once is pretty frightening without the old crutch of smoking. I find myself with a lot of time on my hands and not really sure what to do. Boredom has always been my biggest trigger and it's got me worried.

There's only so much I can clean and so many chores I can do to keep busy. I am motivated to keep going but could definitely use some support.

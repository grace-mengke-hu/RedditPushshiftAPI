After a year and a half. I relapsed.

A year and a fucking half and I bought a pack on the way home from work today. I had been having one of the worst months of my life due to the fact that a close familly memeber of mine passed away, my girlfriend of two years left me and my jobs in jeoprady due to a stream of lay offs. After all the stress I finally said fuck it. What im trying to get across is dont make the same mistake as me and let the stress get the better of you. I think after this pack im gonna start from scratch again

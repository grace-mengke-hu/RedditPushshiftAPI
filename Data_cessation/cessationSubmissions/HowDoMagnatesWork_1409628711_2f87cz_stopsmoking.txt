Close call today

It's been a run of bad luck lately.  My car is broken down, I accidentally broke my laptop the other day, etc.  I really wanted a smoke for the first time in a while because of this.  At one point I had decided to walk down to the gas station and get a pack.  But somehow I talked myself out of it.  

I guess I don't really have much of a point here, but I just want to say that shit like this happens, tempers flare up, and the nicotine urge swoops in with it.  Be vigilant, people.

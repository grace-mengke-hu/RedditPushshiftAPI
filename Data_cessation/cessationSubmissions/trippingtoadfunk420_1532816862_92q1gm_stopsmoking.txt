Today Marks 550 Days of Not Having ANY Nicotine products!

I quit randomly one day and haven't looked back since. Feel free to ask questions if you wish. I won't lie and say that every now and then I will get a whiff of a nice cigarette and immediately want one but I am for sure glad to be on the other side.

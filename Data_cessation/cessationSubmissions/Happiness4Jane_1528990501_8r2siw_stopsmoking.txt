It’s all about Attitude - create a better reality.

It’s all about attitude. If you don’t want to smoke, you won’t. It really is that simple. If you believe you’re awesome for quitting and life is better as a result, it will be. If you believe that everything and everyone sucks because you can’t smoke, that’s exactly how life will appear. Perspective is reality. You CAN smoke, but you CHOOSE not to. Because you’re better than that. Because you won’t let them win. Get angry at cigarettes and addiction and big tobacco and tell them all to go to hell. You’ve got this. Life is so much better without them. You’re stronger than they give you credit for. So, put a smile on your face! Embrace the change and start accepting it as the new normal. You’re not a smoker! You’re free! Every time you get a craving just remind yourself... but you’re not a smoker. And let it go.

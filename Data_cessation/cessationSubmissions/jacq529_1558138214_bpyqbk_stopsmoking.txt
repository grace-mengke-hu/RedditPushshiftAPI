I’m wondering how long after quitting is my body no longer physically addicted?

I’m 19 and I’ve only been smoking for a few years maybe 10 a day till I quit. I just broke my streak of 1.5 months by smoking one and I’m wondering if I will get withdrawals again. 

I’m wondering how long after quitting is my body no longer physically addicted? Will smoking just one mean I have to go through that hell first week again.

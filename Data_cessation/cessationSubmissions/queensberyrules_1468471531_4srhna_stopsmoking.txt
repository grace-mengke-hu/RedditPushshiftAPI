Bachelor party fucked me up...

My close friends surprised me last weekend with a surprise bachelor party to New York City. After 960 days of not one single puff went to ashes. On Monday, first day back, I broke down bought a pack and smoked those suckers with a day and half. Its been almost 24 hours since my last one. I think running and confessing to my fianc√©e what I've done helped a lot. Always stay vigilant my friends. I've been smoke free almost 2 years and half and a single weekend ruined it.

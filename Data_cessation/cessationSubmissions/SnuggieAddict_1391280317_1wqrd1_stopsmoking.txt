It's been almost 9 months, but the cravings are back!

Ugh! I don't want a cigarette. The smell disgusts me, the thought of the taste makes me ill, and hey - it's the first winter in a few years without flu or respiratory illness! hooray!

However, the cravings are back with a vengeance. I admit, I'm stressed and have a lot going at work at the last few weeks - but why am I thinking about smoking at all? I thought I cleared my mind of junkie thinking, but it's seems like I'm not free yet.

The worse part - not letting myself smoke is causing me to miss other terrible habits I quit since they made me feel bad - mainly drinking and drugs. I never, for once, missed them for 6 years, but in the last month or so - I act normal but on the inside my brain just wants to get wasted and smoke a pack.

I'm not going to cave, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life craving bad habits. Any tips or idea on how to manage this?

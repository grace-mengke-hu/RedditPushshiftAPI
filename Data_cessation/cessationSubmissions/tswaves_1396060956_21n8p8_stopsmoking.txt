I realize the obvious answer, but does anyone know the best way to remove the smoke odor from clothes and hands?

I know this is /r/stopsmoking and I do plan on quitting but I was wondering if anyone knows any sprays or hand sanitizers that are best to use to remove the odor from clothing?

 Obviously quitting all together is the best option but I am currently still smoking, I used something called "Zero Smell" I found at Bed Bath and Beyond but Im wondering if theres any other sprays, hand sanitizers you guys use or have used? I'm not trying to hide the smell more so just remove it when I'm at meetings, parties, etc.

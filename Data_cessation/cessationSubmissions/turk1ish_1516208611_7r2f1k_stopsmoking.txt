4 days in, already screwed up

I've quit so many times that I feel like it's not even worth it.

Today at work I finally snapped and just bummed a smoke off my co worker. Nothing is helping. I feel unnaturally shitty and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

I have no idea what to do. I can't sleep, and there's a ton of bullshit happening with me right now that isn't helping.

Edit: on mobile. Will reset my counter when I'm home

1 Day Smoke Free, Cranky and Stressed

And I hate everything. I quit yesterday, and I'm having a rough time. My partner is being as far from supportive as possible. He's been cig free for six hours and he's been snapping and snarling for four of them. Apparently this is *easier* for me. Like I'm just breezing through this. 


Not touching a cig again, I'm determined. But I'm get ting sick of dealing with him throwing temper tantrums at me all fucking day. Dude just told me that he's going to go buy another pack if I tell him to stop taking his cravings out on me again.


Someone talk me down from picking the mother of all fights, I'm so goddamn irritated.

Desperately want to escape immediate situation to smoke...but I WON'T

Having one of those mornings that started off good and then fell apart.  Not a horrible day...just generic "things not working out the way I thought they would".

I desperately want to go outside, get some fresh air, and have a cigarette (and yes...I know how messed up that sentence is).

But I also know smoking isn't going to help anything. So right now, right here, I'm not going to smoke. 

(And In the process not mess up my 14 going on 15 days!!!)

Am I fooling myself by trying to quit before finals?

This might be less "I need help" and more of a rant, but...

I've been ready to quit smoking for a long time now. I've made many positive changes such as no longer smoking in my car (I use to have 2 smokes omw to and from school, a 40 minute drive), and I no longer smoke at school. I started reading Allen Carr which has drastically improved my mindset towards smoking.

However... the longest I have been able to clock with out one was about 18 hours. I get anxious, lose focus, and end up getting up from my desk to pace. I feel like I'm losing just as much time studying as I would if I just sat down to smoke. Finals are next week and this semester has been the most difficult and demanding yet. The thought of just waiting until next Friday crossed my mind. I never believed in setting a quit date because I always thought if I was going to stop smoking, cold turkey it would be and it will be no better now than if I did it a month from now.

But I'm starting to think I can't survive next week with the task of quitting on my back. What can I do from now until break starts to not feel so shitty?

A whole year

If you had told me 5 years ago would I be sat here after a whole year of not smoking I would have laughed at you. Smoking was my *life*. It was who I was it was everything about me that I thought was good and interesting.

I've found that to be bullshit.

I'll leave you with a small article I wrote a while back on me quitting smoking.

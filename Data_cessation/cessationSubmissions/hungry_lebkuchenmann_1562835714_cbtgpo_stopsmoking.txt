The second time that I came that far. 5 days ago a staff party with a lot of people I used to smoke with crossed my path (together with lots of alcohol) and threw me back to square one. I feel stupid and donâ€™t want to reset the timer again to zero. How do you deal with alcohol and smoker buddies?

Quit smoking about a year ago, a bit of motivation for anyone thinking about quitting soon.

I started smoking when I was 13. I'm 33 now. I quit smoking as a new years resolution for 2018 but wasn't able to actually quit until beginning of Feb.

I read "The easy way to quit smoking" which I'm sure plenty of you have read and yes, it is just a psychological game. I'm sure most of you that haven't quit will see right thorough it for what it is. I read it twice.

I quit randomly a week after reading it the 2nd time. I was out of smokes, it was cold and didn't want to pack up to go get them. I said forget it and just didn't start again.

Quitting is actually crazy easy with the right perspective- nobody really wants to smoke. There are minor things you may like about it- for me its the smell, I love it- but really we're just afraid of the *pain* of quitting.

The funny thing is, as a smoker you *always* have that pain. Its there all the time except when you're smoking. The wanting, the needing. Once you quit its no longer a problem. The first few days feel weird because you're routine is off, but thats pretty much it.


I know I'm making it sound absurdly easy, but it really is. If you can go a day without smoking you can go the rest of you're life. You're really not giving anything up. You're leaving a wasteful need behind.

Its so hard not so sound diluted or a cult member or something. Its really just a matter of not smoking.

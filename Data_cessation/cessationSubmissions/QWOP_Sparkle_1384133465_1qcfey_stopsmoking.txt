Had my first cigarette today

Broke up with my partner of 2 years, having to cut ties with everyone back home and I'm in my third year of University doing a dissertation project in which half the people in the group just don't care at all.
Sick of this shit. So yeah I fucking caved. Back on the anti-depressants so I don't lose it.
Wanna know what my timetable for uni is this week? 10am-9pm every day apart from the weekend. In which I have to do my script writing. 

Fuck. This. Shit. I'm tired of doing everything alone and my tutor won't even listen to what I have to say. Only to be judged at the end.
I just don't want to fail everything. I've already failed my stop smoking streak so who's to say what I'll fail next?

Feel free to call me stupid or whatever because I already know.

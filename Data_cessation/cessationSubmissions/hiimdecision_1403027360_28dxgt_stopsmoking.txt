Almost 2 months question

Sooo I almost have 2 months - and i No longer feel the urge/addiction to smoke however i still have the desire to smoke. Does this ever go away? For example I don't fiend every 30min anymore but specifically on weekends i want to recreationally smoke on my days off. Sorta how one would do with drinking. So when does the want to smoke for FUN go away if ever?

Kinda done

I've been smoking for a few years now and I'm at my most heavy point (pack a day) and honestly I'm just sick of it. It costs a lot and it makes my lungs feel heavy. The only problem is that I love how they taste. I seriously enjoy my cigarettes and don't want to quit because I feel like I'd be missing out. I love smoking while I drink my coffee in the morning and it's just little shit like that I'd miss. I don't want to quit but I know I have to. Anyone with a little advice for someone like me feel free to throw it my way.

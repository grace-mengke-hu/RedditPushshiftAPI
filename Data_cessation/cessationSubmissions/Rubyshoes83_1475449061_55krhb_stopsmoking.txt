Eating like a pig.


It's day 8. Haven't worn the patch since Friday. All I want to do is EAT. Everything and anything, but mostly junk food - chips, chocolate, etc. Still no smoking, but the cravings are REAL. Tootsie Pops still seem to work for that. Headache....oh the headache. And I never get headaches!

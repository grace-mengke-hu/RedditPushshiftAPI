Day 5: Just sort of depressed

I used to only smoke at night, one or two cigarettes before bed. By used to I mean every night for years and years until 4 nights ago. I'm depressed! I don't look forward to my evenings anymore. I don't like the things I liked. Playing video games and having a glass of wine or two just seems frustrating because I can't go outside in between sessions. I feel like I might as well just go to bed, because I can't relax and have a nice night anymore. I don't feel a an ex smoker trying to quit. I feel like a smoker who's faking it on order to live a little longer. I don't know. It's depressing.

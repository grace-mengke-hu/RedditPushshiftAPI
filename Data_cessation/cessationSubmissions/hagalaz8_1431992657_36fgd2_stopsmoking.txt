When's the cough start?

Almost 10 days into my new non-smoking life, feeling good. This is about the billionth time I quit after 14 years of smoking, but it is very different this time. Why? I found my motivation. I don't think I ever really had it before now.

Anyways, I'm waiting for the cough to start. I want this shit out of my lungs. But....there's nothing. Yet.

For those of you who've been quit longer than a week, when did you start coughing it all up? Or did you at all?

Thanks :D

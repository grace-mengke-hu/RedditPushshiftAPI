Does "tips" and "advice" sometimes just aggravate you further?

I keep getting terrible cravings and when  I look for tips sometimes they're so terrible I just get even more angry.


Like "Do Yoga!"
Listen fuck wads who wrote stupid shit... I'm in server  room all damn day for ten hours a day.  I AM NOT AND CAN NOT just do yoga or exercise.  It's also current 20 degrees outside.


God damn I just want to smoke...

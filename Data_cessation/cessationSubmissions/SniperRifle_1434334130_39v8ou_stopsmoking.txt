realizing temptation

After smoking a cigarette whenever a friend-smoker was around, and making excuses, you learn what situations you should avoid, and what thought trails you shouldn't allow to grow in your brain or that you shouldn't follow. I think the only way to know is to relapse, then get on, then move on, as with anything else; failure is just about getting the right gears into the right mechanism, for the right flow of energy. I don't know. I'm truthfully writing this as a reminder to myself, about which voice to listen to, which voice speaks the Will, and which voice is a Delusion. Namaste.

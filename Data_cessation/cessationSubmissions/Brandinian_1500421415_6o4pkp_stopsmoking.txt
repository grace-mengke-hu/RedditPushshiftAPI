I was a sad, disgusting muck. Now, I'm a happy, healthy, non-smoker. Day one.

I used to hate myself in many more ways than I ever loved myself. I wish I could tell you the amount of time that I've wasted composing letters from my Mr. Hyde-self, the sad and dependent nicotine drug addict, to the Dr. Jekyll-self that woke up every morning craving something that I knew would kill me. I've written literal pleas to myself to stop smoking. Detailed how much I hated it, and how much it made me hate *me*. I felt powerless. But now, I feel empowered. I know that this feeling of euphoria won't last. I've only been smoke free for two hours at this point. However, regardless of the amount of time, I am now a non-smoker. The only one who can make me become a smoker again is me. I'm the only one who can sign my own death sentence. And right now, it's a dotted line that I never have any intention of signing again.

Right now, I feel wonderful. I feel wonderful because I'm not a slave. I'm a free man. I am slowly killing the monster that's been living inside of me. I'm starving it. I'm poisoning it the way that it poisoned me. My nicotine addiction has robbed me of so much. Not being very wealthy, there were times that I made the conscious decision to actually **buy a pack of cigarettes instead of food**. Can you imagine? This fucking weed, the source of my discontent, the thing robbing me of a fulfilling life, was more powerful than my natural instinct to eat. I starved myself for cigarettes. I starved myself in order to *consciously kill myself*. Let's not mistake it. That's what cigarettes are. The longest form of suicide imaginable.

I'm so tired of it all. I'm tired of smelling like an ashtray. I'm tired of laying in my bed at night with my heart pounding. I'm tired of being unable to meditate out of fear that I'll hyperventilate by taking too deep a breath. I'm tired of the sluggishness, the destruction of my wit, the theft of not only my singing voice, but my very breath. It's time for it to end.

There is something devastatingly beautiful in self-destruction. We look up to people that we consider to be role models. For artists, we think that suffering is necessary to create good art. That by smoking, we are perceived as more dynamic or creative. No. We are perceived as fucking mucks, as my man Allen Carr put it. We are perceived as pathetic individuals who are stuck like a dying animal caught in a bear trap. It may be true that there is beauty in self-destruction, but what is even more beautiful? Recovery. Rebirth. Renewal. Each craving is a minor battle in a much grander war. However, the war has already been won with the extinguishing of our last cigarette. We know the outcome. We are non-smokers, and we've won. If we smoke another, then a new war begins. But isn't that a beautiful thought? No nation would have ever entered into battle against another knowing that the war was already decided against them. But it has been. Our war with nicotine is decided from the moment that we make the decision to not smoke. We can never lose. As long as we maintain that decision, we will forever be victorious against nicotine.

This may seem like a bunch of rambling. And in truth, it is. As I've just finished "Easy Way", these are the thoughts that are pouring out of my head. I've tried this program three times. Each time that I finished, I knew that it didn't gel with me. I knew that I still wanted another puff. And inevitably, it always led to my attempts to quit starting with a moment of extreme low and desperation. And that only seemed to get worse. However, this time it **is** different. **I'm not making an attempt to quit. I'm making the decision.** I am regaining control of my life.

I have so much to look forward to. More money in my pocket, not smelling like mothballs, being able to sleep, being able to breath, being able to sing again, an easing of my medical anxiety, and much much more. This is a beautiful and exciting adventure. This is the start of something incredible. It's the moment of being able to see a hint of light in otherwise absolute darkness. This time is different, because this time, I want this. I want it badly. And I've already achieved it. There will be moments of rough patches as the nicotine monster tries to resurface. As it screams and fights and flails itself around in my subconscious. But you know what? Fuck that monster. Fuck the nicotine. It's taken enough from me, and this time, I am going to take every part of it and smother it the way that it's smothered me.

Though I've only been free for two hours, it doesn't matter. I'm a happy non-smoker. And right now, it feels incredible.

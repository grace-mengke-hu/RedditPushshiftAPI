Feels gud

I haven't smoked in three days (well, it will be 72 hours in half an hour) and I feel great. I only had withdrawal symptoms once in those three days and *drumroll* thank you Allen Carr. 

I feel like my mind and thoughts are very clear, and I'm happier than I've been in a while. Shoutout to everyone at /r/stopsmoking too.

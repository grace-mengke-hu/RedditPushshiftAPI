40 hours in and struggling

I'm 40 hours in to quitting and I'm really struggling right now. My mind is racing, I feel like I can't sit still to save my life, and sitting here at my desk at work, surrounded by smokers is making it an even tougher struggle. It's like a feeling of total dissociation with everything right now. 

Sorry all, needed something to keep my hands busy for a hot moment.

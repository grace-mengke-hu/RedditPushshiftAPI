If it’s alright with y’all, I’m going to comment on this post every day I don’t use nicotine, starting tomorrow.

My longest quit in the past came from me committing and then sharing my experiences with this community. I realize I need to share - I can’t fight this alone in my head. Going to try that again, with comments rather than posts so I can say whatever’s on my mind without needing post-quality stuff and so I can look back on it. I hope it won’t disturb anyone if I keep commenting. Love you all. Thank you you for the inspiration.

The first hard test

Hi all! I'm really proud of this accomplishment so I thought I'd share a little trick that helped me not smoke this past weekend. I've managed to not smoke for six weeks whilst away in school last semester but the second I came back into the company of all my smoking friends at home I gave back into the habit. With that said I've been almost three weeks smoke free when I came home for Thanksgiving break but this time I didn't give into the habit. When all of my friends lit up around me I instead of joining them decided to ask for a straw. It might not have had any flavor to it but it certainly kept my hands and mouth busy.
Sorry for being so verbose but just as an idea, next time you're drinking with smokers utilize your straw to help you continue on your successful path of being a nonsmoker. Thanks for reading. :)

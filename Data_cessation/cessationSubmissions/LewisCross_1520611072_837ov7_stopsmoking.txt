When did you quit? What were you doing when you quit?

Like September 11 or the day JFK was shot, you'll always remember the day you quit and what you were doing.  

I smoked my last cigarette on May 10, 2004 at about 8:30 pm.  I was on my way to the store to get more.   I was in my car.  I took out the last stick in the pack, smoked it to the filter before I got to the store, tossed it out the window, and thought "nope.  I'm not buying anymore.  I'm going to use the gum that's been sitting in my desk for months.   I'm done.  I'm not * cough * smoking *cough (Fuck!) * again."

I drove home, brushed my teeth, watched a little TV, and went to bed.   

And I never took another puff again.

35 days and struggling at the moment

I quit over a month ago, the first week was rough but I started to feel better after. I've had a really rough week and I'm feeling the anxiety of wanting to smoke so bad. I'll tough it out but I just want to have more accountability of posting this here so I have another reason to quit.

Allen carr's onlyway &gt; easyway

So I see a lot of talk about Allen carr's book "easyway to stop smoking" but not too much about his book "the onlyway to stop smoking permanently". So for the people who have read easy way and are still struggling I highly recommend reading only way. Onlyway is more in depth and hits more topics. While I read easyway multiple times something just wasn't clicking, but as I near the end of onlyway I really am starting to feel like a nonsmoker. So if easyway didnt quite do it for you don't give up just yet! Onlyway may just be your ace in the hole.

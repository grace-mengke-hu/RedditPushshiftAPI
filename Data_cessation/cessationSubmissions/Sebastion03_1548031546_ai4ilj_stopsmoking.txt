I Used Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and I think "Willpower Quitters" Would Also Benefit From it.

I smoked for twenty years and finished my addiction smoking a pack and a half of Marlboro Red's a day. I read Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and quit before I even finished the book (it's sold over 15 million copies and has a 90% success rate). 

Every smoker who quits deserves a hearty and thunderous round of applause, but I also know (because I was one of them), that there are also folks who quit smoking cigarettes who still salivate over them, who are still scared to be in social settings with smokers, and who think their "quality of life" was diminished by giving up the habit. I think Allen's method does a fantastic job of slaying that lingering beast once and for all. 

If you're interested, I've started up a blog about quitting smoking that I'm hoping to build up into a real resource for smokers who are trying to quit, because in my opinion, a $4.00 used copy of Allen's book is all you honestly need. You can find my blog at:

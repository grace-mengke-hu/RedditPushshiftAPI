Here we go again!

I'm down to my last cigarette and I will not buy another pack.  

I quit last year on my birthday around this time, and everything went pretty well. A few days of moodiness, but nothing insurmountable. I still had the odd cigarette when drinking, but I didn't let any of those get me back into the habit. The only time I really smoked while sober was when my ex visited me from Mississippi and we inevitably got in an argument.  

After the semester ended, I went to stay at my mom's house for a few days to get ready for a visit to my grandparents in Arizona. Around this time, my ex found out that I was seeing someone new and sent me a series of nasty messages. This, coupled with being around my smoker mom, kind of pushed me off the deep end and I picked up smoking again.  

I want to quit now for my health and to save money. A week from now, my girlfriend and I are taking a road trip to California. I don't want to smoke on the trip and I want to be over the worst of the moodiness that occurs sometimes during a quit attempt, so that means I'd better stop today.  

I'm going to be using an app to track my progress and check back here when I feel like I'm going to break. I tried to quit a few weeks ago and made a mistake by not taking advantage of the awesome, supportive community here when I went out to buy a pack after five days.  

I'll update my flair after my last cigarette.

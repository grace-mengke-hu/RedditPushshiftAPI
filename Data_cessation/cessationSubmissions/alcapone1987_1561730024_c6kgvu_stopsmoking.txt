I need help with breaking this habit

Hi, I want to quit smoking but everyday when I wake up I have to head to the washroom to take a Sh\*t but after few hours I feel still bloated and want to make another visit to the washroom but can only do so after taking a cigarette. Please this is not a joke, my bowel movements and my smoking has tied up together. This has been happening for several years now. Is there a way to break this habit. Kindly share your suggestions.

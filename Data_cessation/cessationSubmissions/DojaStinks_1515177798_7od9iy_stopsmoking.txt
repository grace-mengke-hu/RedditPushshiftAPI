Quitting to prove to myself that I can.

Hello everyone!

There’s no real important message in this post, I just feel like rambling.

 I quit before a few years ago for one year, then started smoking again. 
This NYE I was having myself a trip with Lucy(if you catch my drift) and I was about to go out and smoke, looked at the cigarettes, and just felt disgusted. I put them away and haven’t touched them since. I currently have an entire pack and I haven’t touched it in 5 days!

I didn’t mean for it to happen, but now that I made that decision I just want to prove to myself that I can keep it going!

I have been struggling lately with depression and motivation, so this is kind of a big step. Proving to myself that I can do this has also opened myself up to other things, like exercising daily and keeping my apartment clean. It’s as if I hit a “reset” button in my brain. It’s great!

Anyway, that’s all I came here to say. Thanks for reading my ramble and good luck to anyone out there who is struggling!

Much love.

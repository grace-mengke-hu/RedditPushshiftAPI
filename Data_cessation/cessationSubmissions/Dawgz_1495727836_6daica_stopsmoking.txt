First time quitting. 4 days in.

I've never quit cigarettes before, I have quit other things though but I have no self control to the things I love and is something I'm going to have to control throughout my life.

I started at the late age of 20, now 25, I  had a epiphany while hiking that caused me to realize I have a breathing problem. All the way up the mountain all I could think was I wanted to get off, bitching and moaning the whole time. I had to sit down for a moment and realize that's not who I am, I usually take responsibility for my actions but this I thought was just me getting older but really it was the stress on my heart, lungs, and mind.

I do feel a little off though, slight shakes, headache (almost like a pressure all around my head), but really nothing I can't handle and I feel super fortunate after reading what others may be going through.

Best of luck to everyone else!

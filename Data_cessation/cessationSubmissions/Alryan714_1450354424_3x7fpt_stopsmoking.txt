6 months!!

I made it. Half a year down. Now to make it to a whole year. I know I can do it. I would have posted this yesterday but I was at a funeral. I am staying stronger than the cigarette. I am so happy I have made the choice to quit. I still want to smoke some days when I am stressed but I have found ways to manage. Yoga is a big help.

How im quitting

Just found this sub at random, wildly appropriate for me at the moment.
Im 21 and smoked for about 6 years growing up with 2 parents who both packed 20+ a day. My dad died of ill health about 4 years ago, and mum quit smoking at the time. I've always been on and off. But i found the one thing that helps the most. Jogging.

Im pathetic at "yogging" but it doesnt matter. Just 10 minutes of starting and stopping clears your lungs. Then the next day you feel twice as capable. Now im jogging for an hour without stopping once. When i lapse on weekends and smoke, i feel it badly at the next jog. 
Also track your sleep and make sure you get 8 hours. Smoking gave me mild sleep apnea, which is when you dont breath properly in your sleep and get headaches/groggy/sore throats in the morning. Quitting stopped this nearlt immediately. Also when i brush my teeth i dont get yellow gunk coming off at the end.

Iv also lost over a stone since doing this. Its all about lifestyle choices. Smoking was RIGHT for me before, but now, its not. Perhaps one day we'll meet again, perhaps not!!!

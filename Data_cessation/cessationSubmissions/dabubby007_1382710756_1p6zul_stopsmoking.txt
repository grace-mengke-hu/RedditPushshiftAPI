Almost smoked a few days ago

I was in the Bahamas this pas week and while in Freeport this past Monday I ended up in a cigar shop looking for a pipe for my brother in law.  I noticed that they sold Cuban Cigars and almost bought one just to smoke it and say I have had a Cuban before.  I didn't have any cravings, just the desire for the forbidden. In the end, I talked myself out of it knowing I haven't ingested any type of tobacco in over 4 years and I want to keep that going.

After 279 Days, I believe I have relapsed.

I was a two pack a day smoker for over five years.  I had been doing so good over these last months until recently.  I lost my job in December and didn't smoke and even lost went out drinking without an incident.  But it wasn't until I got engaged recently that the stress really piled on.  I know that I can't really blame this on my engagement because I was an addict. But in the last two weeks I have bought two packs of cigarettes and smoked one from each pack before throwing them out the car window.  But today I had one and it felt so good to smoke that I had three more.  I was a little tipsy while this happened by the way.  I feel terrible and know this is wrong but I feel like I am relapsing.  What should I do?  I have talked to my fiance about this and she absolutely understands the stress but also hates the fact that I smoked.  The taste was terrible with my last few cigarettes but today they tasted wonderful.  Can anyone give me some advice?

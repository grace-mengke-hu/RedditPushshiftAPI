Day 27 - any advice on replacing smoking with a healthy activity to decompress?

I'll be in day 28 by this evening. I've gotten some great advice and support from this sub in the past week, which has been the hardest and rockiest period in my quit so far. So a big thanks to everyone here for the solidarity! And congrats to all the New Year's exsmokers who have now made it a week!

I've been dealing with a lot of anger and irritability the past week. It's starting to subside now (thank goodness) but I still find I have a hard time with it from about 3pm to 8pm. Outside that window, I'm totally fine - level mood, no cravings, and increasingly long periods of time without any thoughts of smoking. 

I can't help but think this 3-8pm "anger window" has something to do with years of smoking being my treat to decompress from work. I hated my job for the last 6 years. I moved into a new job I actually like a few months ago, but the association still seems to be there at that time of day. I used my smoking breaks in my old job to escape for a few minutes when I felt overwhelmed or miserable. I don't need to do that anymore, but yet my brain still says I need to...and that I should do it with a cigarette.

Has anyone else run into this situation? How did you break the association? What did you replace smoking with for decompressing?

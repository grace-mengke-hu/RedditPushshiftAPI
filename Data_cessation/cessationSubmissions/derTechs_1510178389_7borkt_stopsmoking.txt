Just smoked my last one. This is going to be easy!

You heard it first. Going to be easy. At least I try to convince myself.

Smoked 15 years. Lately up to 30 a day. I really hate this bullshit. Even though I know in a few hours I will try to convince myself that I love it. I've been there. Yeah, I am THAT stupid.

Heck. First hours gonna be easy as I'm going to sleep now. After that I'll see if I can resist my morning smokes.

Will update if I smoked or murdered someone in the morning.


P. S. Smoking is fucking bullshit. Plain bullshit.

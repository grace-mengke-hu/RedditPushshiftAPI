I've quit 84 days ago and I've been struggling with flu like symptoms for the past 3 weeks. It's this normal?

So I quit cold turkey on the 1st of January. Sometimes I enjoy an occasional Juul vape hit, but comparing that to a 15 cigs per day smoking habits is impossible.

Anyways, I've been struggling with flu poblems on and off ever since. This last one has been lasting for 3 weeks and I have horrible cough with mucus coming up.

Is this something that you have experienced as well? Is this normal?

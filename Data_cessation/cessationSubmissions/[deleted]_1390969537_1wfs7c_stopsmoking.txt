25? days, chewing nic. gum

Sadly, I don't have a ton of resolve. I quit for over 3 years, then bummed a cig or two, then smoked for 2.5 months. I quit because a buddy of mine quit on 1/1/14 but now i don't give a crap. Cravings for the drug are not that bad, but mentally, I just want one. helps with the stress. (tired of the damn captcha already!)
EDIT 26 DAYS

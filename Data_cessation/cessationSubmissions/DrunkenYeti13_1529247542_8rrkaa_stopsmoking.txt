Was thinking about a smoke then the most perfect thing happened

I've been without a smoke for a couple months now. I don't keep exact track because I don't want it to be part of my everyday life. I still get cravings every now and then and the other day was one of those days. I was really thinking about trying to bum one, when I walked past a guy who just lit up. He start hacking and coughing like crazy and i immediately lost interest.

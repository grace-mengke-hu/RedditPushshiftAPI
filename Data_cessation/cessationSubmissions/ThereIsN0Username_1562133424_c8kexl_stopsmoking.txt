Obstacle Plan for Upcoming Journey

Tomorrow I begin reducing the maximum amount of cigarettes I will allow myself to smoke.  During the next 7 weeks, I will go from 18 cigarettes a day to 0.  If my progress slows or stalls, cold turkey planning begins.  The latest I will let myself smoke a cigarette will be August 19th.  

In preparation for this, I have written up some plans for what I will do when I face certain triggers during my reduction to confront and/or change my habbits and nicotine addiction. They are:

- Changing activities/headspaces: Start 5 to 20 mins on my next activity before having a cigarette

- Driving: Chew gum/drink water while driving, cigarette has to wait until I arrive at my destination.

- In-between/Unstructured Time and Periods of Boredom: Work 2 to 5 mins on next action of current project/hobby before smoking

- Stressful Situations: When possible, physically distance myself from situation. Take a deep breath and drink some cold water. Only can smoke once I no longer feel stressed.

- Intoxication: Consume less that I normally would in situation. Before smoking while intoxicated, read a thread or two on this subreddit.

-Feelings of Low Motivation/Will-Power: Before smoking or making any major decisions at these instances, review my reasons for becoming a non-smoker, review the benefits of quitting, and visit this subreddit. If still thinking about smoking above the day's limit or giving up on this journey reach out to you all or friends and family. 

- The Schemy and Bargaining Voice in my Head: Same steps as before. Don't listen to that fucker. Remember that anything that goes against the idea that I DON'T WANT TO SMOKE is based in a lie that I'm intentionally believing in do avoid discomfort. 

I'll be journaling my cravings, triggers, and rewards of this habbit daily in my notebook. Hopefully this information will help advace or pivot my plan as the reality of the situation unfolds.

If anyone has any comments, contructive criticisms, or encouragement they would like to share, it is definitely welcomed. Hopefully this feeling of readiness and excitement about quitting will stick around for a little while. Thank you to this community for helping me realize that walking away from this addiction is something that doesn't always end in failure and something that is worth giving a genuine try to.

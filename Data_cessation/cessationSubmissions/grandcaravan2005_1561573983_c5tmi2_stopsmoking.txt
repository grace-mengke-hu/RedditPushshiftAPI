Mood significantly improved extremely shortly after quitting?

Hello, I had a very, very, unfortunate addiction to tobacco bong rips (sounds gross to an outsider, but there really is something to it). I even got to the point where I bought a $300 setup (newvape flowerpot) to vape the loose tobacco in the bong for my health.    

This definitely decreased the tar and stopped me from coughing up crud, but the short term effects the tobacco buzz gave me like feeling lifeless and out of it were still unwanted.

Well I finally decided to pour out all my cheap tobacco and give away all my nicer stuff (dohka, fine pipe tobacco) to a good friend who would want them. Literally within a day I noticed I already am feeling more clear headed,  more in touch, motivated, I feel like my senses of my reality are greatly improved and my energy is much better.   

I was a little irritable especially in situations like traffic, but still felt like far more vocal and lively about it. Just genuinely surprised how positive of an experience this has been.   

Hoping to stick with this, been off ALL nicotine for 3 days now.  I would like to be able to travel anywhere and sit at places for prolonged periods of time without NEEDING to have a bong/tobacco/ takes constant breaks. And the extra energy and clarity I'm experiencing is bringing me back to when I was a child before I started having tobacco problems.   

Just felt like sharing and curious if anyone could relate. I am pretty sure it is just my blood flow, less carbon monoxide, blood pressure returning to normal. Feels so good after all these years. I feel a deep pain thinking of all the time lost of my youth under the hazey spell of tobacco.

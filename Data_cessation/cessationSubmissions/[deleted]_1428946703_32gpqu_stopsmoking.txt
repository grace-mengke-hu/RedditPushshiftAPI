So, this is it.... I'm done.

I've been smoking for about 10 years. I quit for two years when I was pregnant and while my daughter was an infant then I started back up - worst choice ever.

I don't even smoke during the day. I just smoke in the car at night. I think it's more of breaking the habit vs breaking the chemical addiction.

I just need help staying focused and saying NO. 

I'm excited to start this journey and I hope to utilize this board to help me stay quit.

Started at 15 stopping on 34th birthday, enough is enough.

I declared last night while blind drunk that I was done smoking and now in the light of morning I find that I meant it. I warned my wife that I might be a bit obnoxious for a while, not so much with withdrawal but I did this once before (fell hard off wagon) and I'm going to talk about it when I get cravings. Maybe I can talk here and we can prop each other up. It feels good writing this to strangers even if it is shouting into the void.

It suddenly got rough. But, I am going to make through this without a cigarette. That is who I am.

For past 2 days, the weather has become colder than usual. It rained heavily today. I am heading towards my graduation exam in a few weeks. I am getting intense cigarette cravings for past few days being free from smoking for over 110 days and free from nicotine gums for about half of that. I am even dreaming about smoking. But, I just think that all these things that I associated with smoking I would have to de-link one by one. I need to get through this weather change without smoking, and I need to get through this graduation exam without smoking. The brain is simply in an unfamiliar territory since it hasn't seen rain/cold without a cigarette in a long time. But, I tell my brain what to do not cigarettes. I am not a smoker. I was never a smoker. I just picked up a bad habit for some time thinking it would be fun. It wasn't. Smoking brought be nothing but more pain and anxiety. Now I simply don't smoke for there is nothing to gain from it except misery and a waste of life.

Phew, I already feel better. Time to get back to doing something. 

Thanks /r/stopsmoking for being there to listen when a brother has no one else to talk about this.

EDIT: Yo! Thank you all caring people who put in your words of encouragement, and those who could not but know what it is to get that craving. Extra thanks to those who mentioned how much it sucks to be that sucker who *has to* go out to smoke even in rain and cold. That imagery really helped.

I did not cave in! I watched the animation movie "Planes" and then slept last night. Today, I went to the gym and did legs. I don't even recall why I was that worried last night.

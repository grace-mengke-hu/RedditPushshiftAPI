18/01/2019, day #16

Today was quite tough at times. Had some situations in my privat life where every fiber of the addicted part of my brain was screaming for a cigarette. Haven't had any cravings that bad before.  
But we're here. As of 6 minutes ago, I'm smoke free for 16 days.  

How have you guys been? Going strong? I will not smoke with you today.

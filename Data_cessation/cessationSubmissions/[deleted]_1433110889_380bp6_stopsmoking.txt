Quit smoking but still want to smoke

I quit smoking for 160 days now (I have an app that counts the days) and it was a very easy process.  After months of trying to quit I eventually decided I should after I got very sick (not related to smoking) and it's been a very easy 160 days.  It's been so long since I had a cigarette, but I still want to smoke..  I think it's because I still enjoyed cigarettes when I quit.  Like I didn't quit because I was sick of my life with cigarettes, I just happened to quit because I got sick for like 2 weeks and didn't smoke and decided to just keep going with it.  Only thing that prevents me from smoking is how long I've went without one but I feel like that's not exactly a reason that'll last me forever.. What do you guys think about this?

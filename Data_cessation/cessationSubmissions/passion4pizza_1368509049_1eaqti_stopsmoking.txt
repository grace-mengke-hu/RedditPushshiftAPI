Today is day 1 and I've just started a new job this week... Poor timing for cessation?

So I just moved to a new state and got a new job. I've worked two shifts and due to poor management and short staffing it seems as though it's going to be pretty stressful (restaurant jobs usually are). Thankfully it's good money! 

I've been smoking for 11 years, but really only a heavy smoker for 9 - a little more than half a pack a day unless I'd been drinking, in which case I would smoke 1+ pack(s). I smoked my last cigarette today after finishing The Easy Way and feel fine - although it's only been a few hours. I don't work for another two days and I have to be honest, I am worried about work on Thursday. I'm worried that I chose poor timing for quitting but I didn't want to wait any longer. I am so sick of suffocating myself over and over again every day.. I don't enjoy it anymore and I am genuinely beginning to worry about my health. I've never tried to quit before but have been thinking about it seriously for the last few months. I have never ***wanted*** to quit until now.


So I guess my question is, have any of you been in a similar experience? Did you carefully select the timing of your cessation? Will I be exhausted and crabby on Thursday? Will I feel sick?


I guess I'm just looking for some insight, encouragement and camaraderie. 


Thanks for reading and you have all been such an inspiration to me!

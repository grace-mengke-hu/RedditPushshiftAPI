$527 .... It needs to end.

Bought a pack of cigarettes tonight and the price went up AGAIN. Came home and did the math and it turns out I've spent FIVE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS on cigarettes in the last 30 days, not including the black and milds I also regularly indulge in. Smoking my last cigarette at midnight and tapping out for good. Wish me luck.

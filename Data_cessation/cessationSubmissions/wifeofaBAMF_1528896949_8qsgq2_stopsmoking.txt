ADD smoker on meds. Quit smoking yesterday afternoon, took my meds this AM and need encouragement!!

Just looking for support! I smoked in college 10 years ago and easily quit cold turkey when I stopped taking my meds (for those not aware, ADD meds with cigarettes are incredibly addictive). I don’t even get the urge to smoke when I am not on medication except maybe socially. I started taking Adderall again recently because my husband and I have had a rough year and are both working on improving ourselves and I really do need to be on it to keep my life in order for his sake and mine. I’m on the lowest dose I can take. He’s deployed right now so without him to sort of check me I took my meds and almost immediately bought a pack of cigarettes. I’m smoking a pack a day and I HATE IT. I have kids and do not want to be doing this, I am so ashamed of it. I have no problem not smoking when I am with family or friends (even on my meds and for weeks at a time), it’s just when I go home and feel lonely I feel like “why not?” and then I buy a pack and pound it in one afternoon and am so disappointed in myself.

I am sitting outside vaping right now at the lowest nicotine level, trying to replicate everything I love about smoking cigarettes to get through these first few days and I feel good, but I figured I’d come here to cover the loneliness part.

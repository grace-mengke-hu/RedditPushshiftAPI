Just looking for some support....

So here I am laying in bed at 3 am.  I cannot sleep,  i am feeling nauseous as hell.

Rewind- so Thursday morning i wake up feeling ill, dammit i thought to myself, i knew i was coming down with some vial bug.  I kept getting hot and cold flashes.....but i tried to continue my day like normal.

This included my daily coffee and smoke...well neither tasted good at all.
Tried again after a hot flash session, nope tasted horrible- bye bye ciggy and coffee.  I tried a few more tines over the next few hours to enjoy a cig, but to no success each time left me feeling more and more nauseated as the time between hot flashes decreased.

At about 1 pm on 2/6  i had my last cig....an hour later i was puking my guts out every hour for the next 7 hours (horrible horrible bug).

Afterwards, i did not feel the craving for a cig at all and i went all day the next day without even one.  

Little did i know about the withdraw symptoms.  I always thought people made this shit up....NOPE...this sucks.

I have the same nausea feeling i had before the grand-vomitting-clock.  I still do not want a cig because i have it linked to puking with this nausea feeling.

TL;DR attempting to quit after being ill, now experiencing the nausea of withdraw...and it sucks

No more.

I've been smoking since I was 15, I'm soon turning 21.

Countless times have I told myself I'd quit smoking only to never do so.  
No more of that shit. Last night I made a bet with my cousin.

If I quit for 3 months straight, not a single cigarrette, he'll buy any album I choose.

I took up on this bet because it'll help me quit, and I very much need it.

Here I am Reddit, a new man! A smoke-free man.

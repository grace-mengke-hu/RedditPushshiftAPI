Quick question on possible relapse

Basically I've been cigarette/nicotine free for about 6 months now and the other day I smoked a "blunt" or cigarillo emptied out with weed put in. After I realized I shouldn't of because the wrap is made from tobacco leaf so technically I smoked tobacco just then. I haven't felt any increased cravings or anything after that but does this change anything with my detox?

Time to quit. Any advice for the first days?

I've been smoking for five years now. Started quite late - at 23 - as the result of a bad break-up. 

Been going on since, amplified by a lengthy period of backpacking. My life is quite normal these days (work, sleep, work, etc...) but I still haven't succeeded in kicking this.

The longest I lasted is about a month, but usually I fail within the first week. I'm giving this another go, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys could share your advice for these first few days!

How clean will my lungs be after I quit smoking?

You know how you always see the comparison with the clean, healthy non-smoker lung and the dark and filthy smoker one? Supposing my lungs are nasty after 5 years of smoking, how clean will they get to be after I quit? Will they ever fully recover and get to his glorious previous state?   
I'm just curious.

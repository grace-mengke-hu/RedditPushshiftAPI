Quit cold turkey 8 days ago. I am now "suffering" consistent and powerful burps. Like every 10 minutes. Why?

I've done some research on this, the popular explanation I've seen theorizes that the ex-smoker's diet changes after quitting, causing the excess in gas. However, my diet has not changed whatsoever. The only difference is I do not smoke. 

  Has anyone else experienced this weird side effect? If so, how long does it last? And why is it happening?

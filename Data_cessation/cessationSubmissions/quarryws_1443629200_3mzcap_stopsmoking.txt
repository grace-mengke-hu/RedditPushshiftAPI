What the fuck has worked for you?

So I have this great App on my phone, like many of you, called "Smoke Free" (if you don't have it yet, upload it this very instant! The regular version is free, is very helpful, and suggests this subreddit quite a bit!)  So my mission today, was to come to my favorite Stop Smoking message board, or support website, and to make a post trying to help a few people in their early stages of the big quit.  I love this mission.

It might sound silly because I'm only have 3 weeks, but those of us going through this know EXACTLY how long 3 weeks can feel.  Not only that, but also just how far 3 weeks is in the journey.  3 weeks to me, means I am a real deal, non-smoker! 

So where are you in your quest?  Was has worked for you?  What has really sucked?  Any other Apps or websites that have been helpful?  How about "The Thing" that I've talked about before?  ("The Thing" is the epiphany that happens, the moment of clarity, when you decide that you WILL stop smoking. In my opinion, "The Thing" taking place is 100% necessary and will make your quit exponentially easier.)

Anyway.  If you've not quit yet, or have 24 hours, have faith in yourself. YOU CAN DO THIS.

This sub is a REALLY great tool, and has helped me immensely. I hope it will/has helped you too!

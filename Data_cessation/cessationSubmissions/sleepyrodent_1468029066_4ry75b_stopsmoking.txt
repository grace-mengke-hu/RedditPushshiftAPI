I'm done, I want to quit

My SO and a few friends recently quit smoking and ever since, I've wanted to join them but haven't made the attempt out of laziness and the fact that it's something to waste time with while on break. 

But tonight I was considering not buying food because I'm low on cigarettes which annoyed the hell out of me. I'm not struggling with money but I am very conscious about my spending as if I am. I'm wasting hundreds on them and I'm sick of it! 

So, I'm throwing out everything relating to cigarettes that's in my room right now. I'm washing all my clothes like mad to get the leftover smell out. But I'm doing whatever it takes. 

It's going to suck but it's worth it. 

What helped you all quit? Is there anything I should prepare for?

Quit almost a year now. My smoker's cough has come back. Anyone else experience this?

I quit last March after smoking for 25 years. My smokers cough went away in the first few weeks of quitting. 10 months later my cough came back. I talked to my doctor, she said that quitting smoking will keep your lungs from getting worse, but they won't really heal...

What is your experience with this??

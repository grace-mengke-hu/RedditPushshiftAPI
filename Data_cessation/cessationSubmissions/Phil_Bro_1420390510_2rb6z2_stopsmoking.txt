Day 4 - No Nicotine

OK so here goes, I am still vaping, but all zero nic since 2 am on New Years day.  My thoughts so far:

Day 1 - Complete brain fog, not cranky, but also hung over
Day 2 - Still Brain Fog and more crankiness, trouble driving that's how bad the fog was.
Day 3 - The Fog is lifting, brain feels better still on edge but manageable with understanding from family.
Day 4 - Brain better, edginess subsiding (not completely)

I think I am good and it's all getting better.  I am vaping a lot less, just the real old cigarette triggers.  After a meal, and when finishing a task.  Wish me luck, but there is no way I am going back to being a nicotine slave, and I will check in more and more to let you guys know that I really believe e-cigarettes are definitely one way to quit this habit.

Good luck to all you other quitters and thanks for this sub for all the encouragement.

Dust myself off....

Failed again but I won't stop trying. Just when you think you are sick and tired of being sick and tired you realize you aren't sick and tired enough. This is really frustrating and it definitely kills my self esteem but I will dust myself off and try again. I have been reading alot about why nicotine is so very hard to quit and I understand that I can only arrest it a day at a time. I will continue to post and share until I am finally free and then I can post my experience, strength and hope with others. Yes, I am in recovery too so I have some tools but I just haven't been able to implement them.

I smoked one cigarette. Do I reset my timer?

okay, even reading that, I think I should. But I'm scared I'll start using it as an excuse to smoke more then - may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb psychology. Whereas maybe if I try to forget the smoke I had and keep thinking of myself as a 'non-smoker' .... URGH STUPID STUPID ME!!!

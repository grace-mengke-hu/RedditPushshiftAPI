Ran for a half mile nonstop!!

Ha! I realize that this sounds like a small accomplishment, but it is HUGE for me. I was a pack/day for 20 years. Quit cold turkey 4.5 months ago. I used to not even be able to run for 1/8 mile at a time without needing to stop and catch my breath. It is an amazing feeling to know that I might actually be able to run for some distance in the future. I literally have never done that my entire life. Hereâ€™s to building up some more and working toward a nonstop mile. What a great day!!

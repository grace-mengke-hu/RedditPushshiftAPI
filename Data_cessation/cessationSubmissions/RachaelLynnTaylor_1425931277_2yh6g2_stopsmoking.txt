almost 10 days quit! Yippeee

Almost 10 days quit, brain washing is still there from 19 years of smoking off and on , the desire to smoke lingers off and on telling me that I loved smoking that I still want to smoke, but if you ask any smoker they'd prefer to be a non smoker, every smoker wishes that he/ she never picked up that first cig. and I always feel better physically and mentally being a non-smoker

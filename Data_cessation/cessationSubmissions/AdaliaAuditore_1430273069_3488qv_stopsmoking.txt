My SO is on day 3 of quitting. Is there anything I can do to help?

My wonderful boyfriend of a year ran out of cigarettes Sunday at 3am, and hasn't had one since. We discussed vaporizers or e-cigs but I personally think the best thing would be to get the nicotine out of his system altogether and apparently he feels the same because he hasn't picked up a pack nor an e-cip or vap. I have wanted him to quit since we met but haven't forced him to at all. I try not to pressure him and try not to comment on him smoking. To be honest, I don't know if he's trying to quit for me or himself. But I'm just happy he's giving it a shot. 

I digress...  It is day three, and he's incredibly snippy. I know it's not my fault, and he's not mad at me. And to be honest, some of the stuff he's gotten mad over I've laughed at, although, not in front of him until it passes. I've bought him 4 bags of sunflower seeds (Biggs Dill pickle flavor.. obviously). He seems to have a bad headache and is laying down right now. At this particular stage, is there anything I can do to help him in any way? I have asked and he just turns into an angry little mess.

I love this guy to death and honestly I'm SO incredibly proud of him for doing this. Even for just 72 hours (so far). I'm so happy for him. I know this is rough for him and I want to help as much as I can.  Any ideas?

I really appreciate any advice you all can give.

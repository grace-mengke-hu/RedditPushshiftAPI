60 hours later...

I have the worst headache and haven't slept well in the past two nights and Im moving to a foreign country on Friday (one of the main reasons Im stopping). 

This is so hard but every time I want to start again I tell myself that this pain and suffering is just a waste of time (excuse the melodramatic tone Im so tired) so I'm gonna keep it up and I think the symptoms will get a little bit easier each day :)

Just threw everything away.

Smoked the last one, threw it away after a couple of (unsatisfying) puffs.  Threw the rest of the pack away, along with all ash trays, lighters, matches, etc.

Today marks the end of my first week on Chantix and one month before my birthday.

Hoping this is it for good this time.

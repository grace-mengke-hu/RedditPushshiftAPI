23rd Day of Awesomeness!

This is my first post on reddit. And i think there would be no better way to start using reddit than by helping people like me to quit smoking. 
It has been 22 days since i quit smoking and i believe there are only 2 things that forces a person to smoke: 
1. Lack of self confidence to find a solution in a  difficult situation.
2. Lack of will power to deal with the craving of smoking. 
Nobody likes to smoke, even i wanted to quit since last 4-5 years. Fyi: i have been smoking since i was 21! And in these past 7 years i have thought about quitting almost everyday. 
I think you need to make a conscious decision to not smoke. Nobody is going to help you to quit. Nobody is going to feel miserable for you. Only you’re going to help yourself. Just decide that it isn’t going to happen anymore. 
Educate yourself about benefits of not smoking. 
Look at videos and photographs of people suffering from cancer, this will in-turn wake you up from the slumber and push your will power beyond your own imagination. 
I keep telling myself one thing every single day which has given me immense will power! 
Quoting William Ernest Henley:
“I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.”

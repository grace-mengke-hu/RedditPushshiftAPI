Two months, new badge, new life.

I earned my two month badge today. It feels like quite the accomplishment.  
When I see people on my morning commute indulging in a smoke, I am often reminded of my life before I made this change. Now it feels as if I have quit much longer than just these two months. 
Although I cannot make any notable claims to improvements of my health, I can say that quitting smoking definitely improved my well-being. And at 23, previously a smoker of 8 years, I know my best years are ahead of me. **A big thank you to /r/stopsmoking** and I hope all of you have as much luck as I did. Always here to offer support.  
To a life smoke-free and happy... All the best.

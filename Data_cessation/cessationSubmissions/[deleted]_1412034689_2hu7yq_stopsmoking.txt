Going to Quit

I just went to my college health center and talked to a counselor on quitting smoking. I am addicted to tobacco and fake weed (spice). I am going to my first NA meeting tonight in about 45 minutes, and I have attempted to quit before. I smoke a full pack when I'm abusing fake weed, but barely smoke when I am not. So after spending a lot of my money this week and it was just wasted, I am going to try really hard to heal my brain and my lungs. I am so tired of coughing. If people could give me some idea on what they went though and how great healing from smoking will be, I would love to hear it. Going to wake up tomorrow and quit cold turkey.

Feeling a bit down

Is it normal even after one month you can still come over tired and feeling low 
I read that if you are still feeling this after two weeks go to see your doctor 
Just wanted to hear if anyone else who has passed a this month milestone and experienced low days with no motivation feeling sad 

Thanks all

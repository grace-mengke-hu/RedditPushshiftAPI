1,000 Cigarettes Non-Smoked

This morning I got a notification from my quit app letting me know that I’ve officially avoided 1,000 cigarettes. This blew my mind, especially because it’s probably a much higher number (I was smoking only about half what I used to when I finally quit.)

One day about 5 months ago, I woke up and thought, “I’m not going to smoke today”.  I was sick and tired of always feeling sick and tired. I haven’t had a cigarette since that day. Occasionally I will pick up my 0 nic vape if I’m drinking, just to keep the cravings at bay, but I have been nicotine free for 5 months, the longest time I’ve gone without it since I was 16 (10 years ago.)

I tried vaping with nicotine for a little over a year and never really quit, if you’re going that route, my suggestion would be to go immediately to 0 nicotine. There is no way to “cut down” and nicotine vaping (for me) was more addictive than cigarettes. The withdrawal sucks, but you’ll get through it. 

I feel so much better about myself, I’ve taken up running, I do yoga now, and I truly feel like I can say I’m reducing my negative impact on the environment (I’ve long been trying to go as green as I can afford to, but smoking always made me feel like a poser.) I truly have no desire for cigarettes anymore. I never thought I could do it cold turkey, but I did. You can too, but you’ll never quit until you’re truly ready. Until that one morning, nothing anyone said could convince me to stop. 

If you’re here on this sub, it’s probably a good place to start, so good luck!

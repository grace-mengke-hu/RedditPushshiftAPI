31 days

hi. it's been 31 days since i quit cold turkey. i had a couple of mouth ulcers and a cold, but that's almost over. looking forward to see benefits in the gym and stuff like that. i feel i can breath better and i don't pant like before when i walk fast or when i'm active in general.
not much urges anymore. a lot of my friends are smokers and i go out with them a lot, but i don't crave smoking like first few weeks.
btw i smoked for 13 years and i'm 28 years old.

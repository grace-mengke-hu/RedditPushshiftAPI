Its getting real

I always said I'd quit if I ever had a kid.  My GF is 6 months pregnant...

3 days ago my last cigarette in my pack finally matched up with my last cigarette of the day so I woke up fresh and cig-less.  I haven't picked one up since.

This is my first time trying cold-turkey and it actually seems to be easier than other methods.  I feel like allowing myself small doses of  nicotine in the past, whether it was patches/gum/vape, only made not having a real cigarette that much harder because it was always on my mind.

I need to make this work and I'm glad I found this sub.  The struggle is real, but so is the support.

Thanks

OK guys I've made this far!! A month and two weeks in

Okay so I'm a month and a week in to not smoking ciggs at all I've also been running quite a lot. Probably about 5 or 4 days a week now. So I've really been turning my life around. I feel so much better now that I can breathe and I'm wondering if I should give up weed and alcohol too considering the negative long term side effects it has or is it just better to live in the moment of being 21 young and dumb. It's just at this stage in my life I  have the power to say no the things that I don't desire anymore. So should I give up weed and drinking or should I continue to live 21 year old adult life with the two substances  that brings me comfort?

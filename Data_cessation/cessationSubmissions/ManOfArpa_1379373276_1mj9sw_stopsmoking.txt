I caved first week and it felt great.

I was quite intoxicated and decided one cigarette would be no problem. It was amazing. I felt light, elated and calm. It made me remember how great the first couple of smokes were way back when.
I'm sorry if this is far from being as motivational as other posts here, but I feel the need to share this. I'm still hellbent on quitting and I haven't smoked since, but I'm thinking I might have a cigarette every now and then in the future (like once a week). Could anyone convince me this is a bad idea?

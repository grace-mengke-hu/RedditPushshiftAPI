Ugh...Day 1

I'm finally going to do the damn thing. Almost six months ago I quit drinking and some other things so I can do this, RIGHT?????? Going to employ the one second, one minute, one hour, one day, mentality with quitting cigs also and that will help. I'm really nervous that this is going to stress me beyond belief, I'll be a raging bitch, and will cave within a matter of hours, but I am going to try to think positively. 

Is the worst of it really in the first week? 

Good luck to me and all of you!

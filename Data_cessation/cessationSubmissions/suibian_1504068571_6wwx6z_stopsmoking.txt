What do you use to help you stop cravings?

I really like that chewy ginger candy you can get @ Trader Joes and other places. I also like to eat sunflower seeds. I have this huge oral fixation whenever I see other people smoking, so if I have something to occupy my mouth with, I can usually keep myself from smoking. 

The ginger candy is perfect because it makes my mouth really hot and spicy, which makes me not want to smoke. 

Another friend of mine drinks kava and smokes herbal cigarettes sometimes.

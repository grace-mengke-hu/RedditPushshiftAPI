Passed the week mark!

Can't sleep so I figured why not post after lurking for a while! I told myself that cliche of I can quit whenever I want! I made myself believe it but then I started noticing how upset I got if I couldn't find my smokes on the 45 minute drive home from work. My packs at the beginning lasted almost a week to not lasting two days. It's been over a week and there were days I felt like absolute shit and my lowest point  was picking out of the ash tray of my car (I really need to clean it out) a cigarette not fully smoked just to keep myself from buying a new pack. Going to work I have a cup of coffee and that keeps me busy but going home is the worst. I keep rationalizing how I can buy a pack and just have one here and there but I've managed to keep driving past the 7-11 and head home to distract myself with Reddit or my Roku. This is the first of many changes I plan on making this year.

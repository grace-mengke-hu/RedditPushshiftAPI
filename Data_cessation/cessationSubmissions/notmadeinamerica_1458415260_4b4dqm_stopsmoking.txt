Day one - horrific symptoms.

So literally been smacked in the face with symptoms I wasn't expecting. This is my 11th time quitting and it's never been like this before. So fatigued I can hardly hold my head up, I'm so hot it feels like steam is coming from my clothes, and so dizzy I can't stand up. If tomorrow is like this I'm getting cigarettes.

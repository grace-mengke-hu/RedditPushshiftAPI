Second quit: 90 days!

I quit smoking for 4 years (was pack a day smoker for 10 years) before a series of personal related issues resulting in me losing that first quit..

Found it increadibly difficult to get my second quit going after being on the smokes again for about 10 months but here I am 3 months into my new quit!

Two lessons here for those on the journey to better health and personal freedom:

1. A single puff WILL result in you getting back into the habit no matter how long you have been smoke free. Once an addict always an addict unfortunately and this is something that you will always have to remember for the rest of your life.

2. It is harder to get going on your second quit but once you start it is significantly easier to keep at it as you know exactly what to expect. Just make sure you are committed to the cause!

Hopefully this quit lasts significantly longer than my first and I hope that fellow relapsers are encouraged to give up this filthy habit once again and are not discouraged if they have relapsed after a previous quit!

Caved and trying Chantix

Just posting so I can revisit and share experiences... I've attempted more quits than I can count. Mostly cold turkey tries, but also NRT  and Wellbutrin (which made me lose my marbles). Only cold turkey ever stuck, and never more than a few months to a spotty year. 

 I'm on day 5 of Chantix, with none of the bad side effects I feared so far. Ive done better  during the work day (when i usually dont smoke anyway), and the cigarettes I smoke are becoming less rewarding, although  I've lit as many as usual even if I can't bring myself to finish them. Quit day is Saturday, when I take my preschooler  to an amusement park all day. 

  Wish me luck and clear perspective. I'm sick of being a slave to this.

Stopped smoking this morning after a year of smoking (19)

I know, I know. Most of the people smoked for way longer than me and probably also more (I smoked around 10-12 cigs a day), but the combination of smoking and asthma is quite literally, slowly killing me. 

The past year hasn't been great in terms of my energy, my weight, my stamina and my bank account. The real downfall came in March, when I dropped out of college because I wasn't doing enough for it. If you take into account a Cum Laude graduation from High School, it was not necessary and one of the reasons was, I believe, a complete lack of exercise and energy. 

Well, we're half a year later now and I'm studying again, working 20 hours a week next to it; everything was going well. Until three days ago. My lungs started to feel like I couldn't breath and breathing actually was hurtful. I immediately cut down on the cigarettes. I had five two days ago, three yesterday and I guess the last one was this morning (13 hours ago).

I'm still waiting for the pain in my lungs to go away, but it is getting better although I've been coughing fulltime for the past few hours. It's part of the job I guess.

So now: my first real attempt to quit. I've got two more cigs at home and I feel like keeping them for a moment where I really feel like I need them (Is this a bad idea?), but I guess I can do without those two. I really look forward to go running again, without going out of breath after two minutes - I've read that you can already feel the difference after only two weeks, so that is something I look forward to!

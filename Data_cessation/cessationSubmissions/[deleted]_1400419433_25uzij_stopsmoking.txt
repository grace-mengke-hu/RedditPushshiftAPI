So, I have to quit 'cause no mo money

Basically I've run out of money - I'm a student with a tiny income - and have to choose between buying a couple of packs or eating. Eating it is. It's been nearly 24 hours since my last cig, and I don't even feel particularly shitty. Just kinda want a cig. Been smoking 20 a day for nearly a year now. 

I was imagining some kind of actual withdrawal, but I feel no physical symptoms at all, simply a psychological urge to smoke and a tiny bit of brain fog. I guess my perspective on what constitutes withdrawal is sort of skewed, having experienced opiate withdrawal(*Craaawliiiing iiiiiin my skin* etc). 

Anyways, does it get significantly worse than what you feel after roughly 24 hours? If not, then I guess I'm good.

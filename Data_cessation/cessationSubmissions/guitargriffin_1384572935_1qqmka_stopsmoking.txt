Today I decided to quit. Any advice?

I have only been smoking cigarettes for about a year, and decided that it wasn't worth it. Especially now that I moved to Chicago for school, and the cheapest pack I can find is over 10 dollars. I know I can do it, I just need some motivation. Any advice to help quitting would be awesome!

Hello /r/stopsmoking today is day 4 and I've been sick for 3 of them. Is this normal?

I'm not a guy that gets sick very often and when I do it's almost always just for 24 hours.  It's probably been 3 or 4 years since I've been sick for this long.  I can only assume it's related to quitting.  I am using the e cig so I'm still getting my nicotine but not all the other crap.  My symptoms are very sore throat and my head feels like a balloon.  Woke up with the sweats this morning but no fever.  Thank you for any input.

Just smoked after 2 years

And it literally didn't do ANYTHING.  I took my first pull and was expecting all the typical feelings and literally didn't feel anything (anything good, that is) from it.  Just want all you guys to know that there's nothing to go back to.  Also does anyone know the science behind that?  Because it confuses me honestly.

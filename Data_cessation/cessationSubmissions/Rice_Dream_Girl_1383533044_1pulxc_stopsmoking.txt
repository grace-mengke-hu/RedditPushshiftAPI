Thoughts on my fifth night

I've smoked for about a year and a half. I managed to quit for two months over the summer, but coming back to school and hanging out and drinking with smokers more frequently got me right back into the habit. I quit again a few days ago, and I'm also cutting out alcohol, at least for now (for different reasons, although it will definitely help prevent a relapse). I've generally smoked around half a pack a day, although that could easily increase to a pack or more on nights of drinking.

This is my fifth night. I'm really stressed, I have a lot of work to do, and the cravings are pretty bad. It feels like everything would become so much easier if I went down the street and bought a pack. I would feel so comforted.

But as difficult as it is, the agony I'm going through right now is enough reason to quit. Before I smoked, I never needed cigarettes, and the fact they seem *so* necessary to me right now shows how fucked up addiction is. Why should I ever feel the need for a cigarette? There is nothing pleasant about them; all they do is make me want more cigarettes. It's absurd!

Thanks for listening. Didn't expect myself to post here ever, but I'm going a little bit crazy. Stay strong, everyone.

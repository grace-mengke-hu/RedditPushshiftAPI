Messed up with the patches &amp; gum...

Yesterday I'd posted that I went 2 weeks.  This is still the case. I haven't faltered. But I think I messed up the patches &amp; gum.  I went off the patch altogether, and tried to go without the gum yesterday too.  That was a mistake that I realized after chowing down on a whole bag of doritos &amp; a chocolate bar.  

How often does that happen?  I've heard people gain weight after quitting. Is that a myth?  

I'm going back to the gum for the time being since I have tons of it since I don't want to make that mistake again.

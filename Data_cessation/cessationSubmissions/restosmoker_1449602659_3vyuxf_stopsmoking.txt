I'm done smoking

So I work at a restaurant/fast-food chain in a college town. Theres lots of international students that attend this college and they bring imported cigarettes. Most of them forget their packs behind so we keep them(I know some of you guys would say its unsanitary, but I'm not one to go out and buy my own cigarette packs.) Some of you would know how stressful working at a restaurant is so I took one of the packs that was left behind and decided to go out and smoke it.

I picked up the habit of going out on smoke breaks because thats the excuse everyone here uses to get a break. It did relieve some stress and I get to talk to random smokers when I ask for a light. It was fun and made the day go by faster. That went on for about 3 months until today.

I was opening shop and I just went out for a smoke break. I wasn't feeling it and just wanted to get over the cigarette and do something else. I barely lit it and I just immediately tossed it on the ground after one puff, stepped on it and just tossed an almost full pack into the trash. I think I'm just using smoking as an excuse and I got hooked on it so I just decided to stop and find something else. 

I know my terminology is bad and this might sound like a lame story but, I just wanted to share it with someone since I kept this a secret from people I care about.

I MUST stop. NOW. Scared.

I want to stop RIGHT NOW. I'm wheezing here in bed thinking how ridiculous it is that a young 36 year-old is wheezing. This morning, I woke up and coughed so hard I threw up mucus. This is utter bullshit. 

In May, I read Alan Carr's book and quit for three blissful days. Then, I had a couple glasses of wine and fucked it all up. Here I am again. Lying in bed hoping I don't cough so hard I throw up tomorrow. 

I am terrified of having another failed quit. Yet, I am terrified of what will happen to me if I don't. I've smoked for fifteen years now. It's time to get real. 

Do I stay up all night and reread the book???? How can I stop?!?!?! FUUUUUUCK. 

Ugh. UGH. 

Thank you for listening.

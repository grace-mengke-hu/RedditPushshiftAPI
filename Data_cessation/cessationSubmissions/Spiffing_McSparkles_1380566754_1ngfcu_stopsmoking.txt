A new semester, let's give this another shot

I just started college and found out that smoking is just too expensive if I don't want to live on instant noodles for the rest of the year. That and I'm trying to live a little bit healthier from now on.

I got a prescription for champix last week because I tried to quit without help before and those attempts never lasted. I also tried nicotine replacements and those worked for as long as I kept taking them. I'm thinking the champix is kind of an investment, it's expensive at first but I'll be saving money on cigarettes.

Money is the primary reason for me to quit, but I'm also concerned about my health. I also started running today and I felt like I was dying after only a few minutes.

Every time I venture on this sub, I'm getting jealous on everyone's badges, you're all awesome and I'm determined to join all of you.

What sort of an ex smoker are you?

Up to you where you want to put the intonation on that question lol but I always promised myself I'd be as obnoxious as possible , holier than thou ex smoker , almost condescending , disgusted with other smokers 

But thankfully I'm not. In fact I'm not even an ex smoker , I'm a non smoker ! I quietly decline any cigarette offers and if I get into a conversation about smoking I really try to be as logical and as supportive as possible to the smoker cos we're in the best position possible to advise on quitting, have the best viewpoint on how tough it is and can be, but most importantly how vast and varied the benefits of quitting really are! Which is why this forum and you guys rock !!

Well the only person I sort of have a go at is my dad , still smoking after starting 64 years ago... He ain't ever gonna stop :(

So I'm a very happy, very contented but still very cautious ex / non smoker, slightly regretful that I gave 24yrs of my life over the cigarettes but looking forward to a smoke free life !

How about you ?

Chest tightness?

I'm almost done with day 2 and I am as irrational, crabby, and homicidal as I expected. So I think this thought can be filed into the irrational camp- I feel like I'm getting lung cancer from quitting. My chest and upper back and lungs all feel like they are on fire. Did this happen to anyone else? Is it physical or is this my brain tricking me?

It has been awhile.

I came here when I stopped smoking. I read many stories and comments. I thought for sure I would never make it because I had been smoking for over 20 years. But I am happy to report I have been smoke free for a half year!!! I am so happy my Heath is a work in progress but I love how things smell and taste. I have found things I used to hate I now like. I can not stand the smell of smoke. When I go some where where there is smoke I can not wait to leave. O no longer really crave them. Don't get me wrong there are days when I am like OMG I wish I had one but I have not caved at all. So know you can do it!! Just my best advice do it on your own terms not anyone else's. Thank you all for the stories and trials of becoming a non smoker. O will probably check in again at see point. 

I am posting this on mobile so sorry for formatting.

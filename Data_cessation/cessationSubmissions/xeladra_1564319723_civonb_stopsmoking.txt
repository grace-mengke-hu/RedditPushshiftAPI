When I feel the urge to smoke, I come here.

I go through new posts and give advice to all new quitters. It helps so much. Iâ€™m nearly a year in and I do still have cravings but dealing with them has become a breeze. Alcohol really brings out the cravings though. Just sharing with you guys to let you know that you can do this friends. I believe in you!

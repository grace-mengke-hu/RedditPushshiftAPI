Yeah, 250 days cold turkey. I never thought I would quit smoking. It seems like such a distant idea to me now and when I do get that random thought to have a smoke I almost laugh at how stupid it is to do that to myself. Amazing how the brain rewires itself. :O :) :D.

My birthday is next week and I'll be getting a new 0 at the end of my age, on to a fresh start and on to accomplishing something else because if I can do this, I can probably do something else that's pretty cool too :P 


Keep on your quits ladies and gents, the pain will pass into the background and slowly become a memory. I'm glad I quit. If you see my 250 days and think I'm on top of some unreachable mountain, think again.. It's just 8 months.. It went so fast, just like any other 250 days of adulthood.. In the rear view mirror and out of sight so fast into the annals of memory.

I think this is finally it! NYE resolution is actually happening for once (7 days)

I am Male, 21, and I smoked for 5 years straight. This past year I definitely didn't enjoy smoking, and struggled to quit. I probably tried to quit at least 10 times, but none of my attempts have stuck like this one currently is.

What I think is most important about quitting is you must WANT to quit. Many people quit, but not for their self, and I feel it doesn't work. My past attempts I would "quit", and the next 7 days would be filled with trying to bum cigarettes off of people. Then I would end up smoking again. Drinking didn't help. Finally, I am doing it for myself. I want to quit because I will improve myself from it, and I no longer want to waste my money, support that industry, and be a victim of lung cancer, or other smoking-related diseases.

Last new years my resolution was to get in shape, but I did, but smoking has really held back my endurance, which doesn't help me at all, because I am training to run races. I feel like I was lying to myself by continuing to smoke. My lungs have felt so much better lately, and I couldn't be happier. It also is good because a pack in Chicago, where I live, is upwards of $12 or $13. No fun.

If you think you are ready to quit, just make it 3 days, and it's smooth sailing from there. I have an e-cigarette, with very very low amounts of nicotine right now to get me through this, but I hope to get a 0 mg nicotine vapor for down the road.

Will I ever smoke a cigarette again in my life? Probably yes, but I never want this to be a part of my daily routine. Smoking is great, i'll admit it, i've been doing it for a long time, but for the sake of my body, I would not like to smoke regularly ever again. I can see myself enjoying smoking once every 2 or 3 months in the future, but right now I want to cut it out of my life.

Just wanted to share, hope this helps anyone else out there struggling like I was!

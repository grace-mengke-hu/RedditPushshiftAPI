10+ year pack-a-day, quitting for the first (and only) time.

Hey everyone!
I had considered quitting several times in the last few years and never took action. Hell, I've never even attempted quitting before.

Just the other day, however, I was having a cigarette (after a nice dinner with my brother who quit over two years ago but also took up vaping) and I wasn't even enjoying it. It was just habitual, an instinct.. It sickened me. For the first time I was just disgusted that I was smoking. I'm getting closer to 30 now and looking back on what I thought I would be when I was older certainly never involved an almost hourly habit to quench an addiction. I didn't even finish that cigarette, I put it out and threw it away. I stopped at the gas station on the way home knowing that I only had 2 smokes left in my pack and thinking I would buy more. Before even getting out of my car I decided that now is as good of a time as any to stop. So I just turned around and left, I went home. I threw out my pack when I got back too. That was about 7pm EST yesterday, so in just a few hours I'll already be a day in.

I've never done this before but I'm done.
I don't want to be a smoker any longer.
I know I can beat this with a strong will, and positive support.
I. Can. Do. This.

I took some time to look into nicotine withdraws and what to expect going 'cold-turkey' but I welcome any tips or tricks picked up by any of you as well.

When I get a craving I reach for my water bottle or chew some gum. I even went for a walk instead of having one after lunch. 

Happy quitting, friends.

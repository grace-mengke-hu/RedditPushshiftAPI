Weight gain after quitting

Hey people I haven't been here for a while but I can say that I have quit smoking once and for all.. So I am almost 6 months smoke free but I am very worried about the weight I gain... 
So I confess that I eat more after I quit, however I ve been working out and followed a balanced diet for the last couple of years... No matter how many times per week I work out and how much cardio I do I still gain weight... Is this normal after half a year of quit? If yes when should I expect my metabolism to be fixed????

Ps... I prefer to be 3kg heavier rather than having a hole on my throat

Two weeks smoke free!

Hey fellow redditors,

Not much to report but I just wanted to say how excited I am to reach this milestone. I have never quit this successfully before. I haven't gone this long without a single drag since I started smoking and it feels *liberating*.

Today, I didn't have a single craving.  **Not one**. If you're having trouble staying on the horse, just keep at it. I have an extremely addictive personality and if I can drop the habit then so can you.

Thanks to this amazing sub for your support. It would not have been possible without you.

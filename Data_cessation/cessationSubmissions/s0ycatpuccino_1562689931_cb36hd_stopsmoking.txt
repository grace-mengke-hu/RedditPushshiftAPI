(First day!) NRT and jobs that for nicotine?

Around midnight I had my final smoke. My partner is quitting with me.

I just woke up so nothing's hitting me yet, but I've attempted before so I know how it'll start.

The thing is I just realized, in a month I'll be looking for a new job. It might be a place that doesnt allow smokers, so they might do some sort of nicotine test?

But I need NRT for a while. I already know patches and gum work best for me, not gonna vape or anything. I'm just worried about the job stuff next month.

I dont know how nicotine tests work or if patches would put out enough to be noticeable.

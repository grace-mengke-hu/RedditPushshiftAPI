I Need Help

Hey guys. I started following this sub; I want to stop smoking and I think I need some support.
(This is going to be a long one with a little TMI, and I apologize.)

I started smoking at 18 and only stopped once when I was 21. I was dating a girl who prompted me to quit. It  was during a messy time when she wasn’t ready for someone with as much baggage as I have, and as people who have quit know, quitting smoking cold turkey brings up some nasty emotions. But she was amazing. She was the one who got away, ya know? The (not really) perfect girl that got me and who I wanted to be with SO badly. She ended up leaving me shortly after because me not smoking was too much for her. (I was snippy and moody. She was a psychology student that just wanted to “fix me”). I found solace in a bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay and a pack of Camel Menthols. 

Now I’m 23 going on 24. I know I haven’t been smoking for as long as some people on this sub and, quite frankly, I feel like a little bitch. I smoke  a half pack on a bad day and maybe 4-5 on a good day. I’m with someone who I know I want to spend the rest of my life with WITHOUT SMOKING. And she hounds me about it all the time. I feel so guilty and stressed about smoking that, sometimes, it makes me want to smoke more because I’m so stressed out. (We also have a cross country move back home next month, my dad is in bad health, and we have a wedding to plan.) Right now I’m in a bad place. What do I do? I’m so scared that it’s going to be another prior situation that I don’t want to risk it. I know smoking makes me more emotional than I already am because I am a woman and we have a million hormone changes ON TOP of quitting hormonal shifts. I’m also afraid that maybe I’m just making excuses.  I just don’t know what to do and I feel stuck. I want to quit, but I am afraid. What do I do? Please help.

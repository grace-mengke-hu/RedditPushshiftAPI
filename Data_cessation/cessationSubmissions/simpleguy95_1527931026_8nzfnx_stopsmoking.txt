47 days of not smoking, but feeling dumb

after 47 days of not smoking and not drinking alcohol, I feel I am not myself, that I am somebody else. No working memory, cant concentrate on work, stopped all other self development like hobbies, exercise, always wanting validation from people to be accepted. I sometimes think i used to be strong when I smoked.

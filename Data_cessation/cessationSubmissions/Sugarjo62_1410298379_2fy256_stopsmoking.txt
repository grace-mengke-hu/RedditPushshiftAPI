Traveling is a trigger

I'm traveling for work and I have discovered that traveling is a trigger 
For me...I'm not an open smoker so because I was a closet smoker, travel was a good time to do it. But now I'm on my first business trip since stopping 9 days ago. I'm determined but it's harder today than it's been all week!!!

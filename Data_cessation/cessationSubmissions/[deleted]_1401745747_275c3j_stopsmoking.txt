Rejoicing for a WHOLE WEEK!

I have no one else in my life right now to share this excellent news, but I can rely on this supportive community to be happy with me.  After reading Allen Carr's book for the second time and rethinking my ways, I've made it.    

For the last six months, I was what I call a "weekday quitter."  I'd always quit cold turkey on Monday, be fine the whole week, and then cave on the weekend.  Never felt any physical withdrawal; it was all mental.  But today marks the end of that cycle, and I cannot wait to move forward to a month and beyond.  

During this week, I created my own little technique that improved my mindset and maybe it'll help other people.  So Allen Carr talks about "rejoicing about being a non-smoker yippie!"  Being the natural, cynical pessimist that I am, I found this damn near impossible the previous times I quit.  I was so miserable.  To overcome this, I made it a habit to wake up in the morning and while getting ready, listen to empowering, up-beat, music that made me happy (think MJ's "Beat It").  I'd literally dance around, sing along, and just think how AWESOME it is not smoking.  How great it is to finally be one of those people who can live their lives to the fullest without tobacco, and picture my day being a non-smoker, and it'd make me happy to quit.  I'd literally just get myself in the mood for a great day without smoking.  I think this is what really helped me gain control of my mind and gave me the willpower to *actually* quit, and I hope it helps someone out there.

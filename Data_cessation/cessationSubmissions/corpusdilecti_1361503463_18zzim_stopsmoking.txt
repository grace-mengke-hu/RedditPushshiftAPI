Decided to quit about 4 hours ago.

I just joined a gym maybe two weeks ago and I finally decided to meet with a trainer today. He put me through a couple of exercises (or attempted to) and I realized just how out of shape I was and how poor my breathing was.  

I got in my car and lit up a cigarette as I was driving home and realized how stupid that whole situation was.  Put it out and decided, in that moment, that I was going to quit smoking.  

When I got home, I took a long look at my pack and rationalized that "since I only have two left in there, I'll smoke those tonight and quit tomorrow morning."  I brought the pack inside with me put it in my gym bag and went to cook dinner.  

After I ate, I got my regular after meal craving, but decided against it.  As the night went on and I sat here playing video games, I kept thinking about stepping out to smoke a cigarette.  

Finally 10:10 PM rolls around and it's time for me to get to bed.  I start clearing stuff off my table and gathering my things in one spot for easy pick up on the way to work tomorrow morning.  I reach in that gym bag and pull out that pack of cigarettes.  I take another long look at that pack and realize I was just making an excuse earlier about quitting tomorrow.  If I don't start now, then I'll just keep putting it off like I have been for 16 years. 

I broke my last two cigarettes and tossed them in to the trash.

I am now a non-smoker who is trying to drop a bad habit.  

I am 4 hours smoke free.  

**Edit:** (06:30 Eastern) I'm now 12 hours free.  But that was the easy part... I was asleep :)

**Edit 2:** (12:23 Eastern) 18 Hours free. 

**Edit 3:**  (11:30 Eastern) 3 days, 17 hours free.  55 Cigarettes not smoked. 

**Edit 4:** (22:13 Eastern) 6 days, almost 4 hours not smoking.  So far I HAVEN'T smoked 92 Cigarettes and I've saved almost $30 dollars.

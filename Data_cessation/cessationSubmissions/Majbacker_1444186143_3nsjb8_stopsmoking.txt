Three weeks....

I've tried to stop smoking several times over the last 10 years or so. Several times without avail. But this last three weeks has been a beacon of hope. For the last year or so, I kept telling myself, " you are going to set a quit date and you are going to quit". Well every time my "quit date" came up, I just bought another pack..... I felt completely enslaved to my smoking habit. I felt like I didn't have the strength to overcome the black hole that is the addition to cigarettes. Then one day I was out front of the office having a smoke and I felt like shit. And I said to myself.....enough. I threw away my pack and decided that now was my quit date. That was three weeks ago. I haven't touched a smoke since. I have been using NRT but I feel sooooooo much better! I have more energy and I feel like I have been reborn. I've been using the smoke free app and it has proven to be very helpful. For those of you who feel that you might be a smoker forever......you may just be experiencing the last moment of dark before dawn....don't give up!!! I know I won't.

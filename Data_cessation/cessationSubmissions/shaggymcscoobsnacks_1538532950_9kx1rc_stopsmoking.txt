Anybody else have a tongue biting habit?

I have been quit for a year and almost 2 months now. Best decision I’ve ever made, hands down. However, I have developed another bad habit. I catch myself lightly chewing on my tongue! This was never an issue before I quit smoking cigarettes. I’m trying to be conscious of when I start doing it, but I quickly get this nagging sensation to do it again! It’s making me feel like a crazy person. Did anybody else develop weird ticks like this after quitting cigarettes?  I hope I nip this in the butt as well

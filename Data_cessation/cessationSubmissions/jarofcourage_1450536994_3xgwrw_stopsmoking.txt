visit the dentist

Yesterday I went for a 4 hour marathon dentist appointment. For context: I have always had a difficult time with my teeth, and have struggled with dental care and with the price of dental visits. And I think I had a defeatist attitude, connecting cigs and dental care, and of course, the nicotine monster was a conniving a-hole. Ex. from the nicotine monster: 'I shouldn't brush my teeth now, it'll make my cigarettes taste bad'. Crazy, eh!

Nonetheless my teeth are all cleaned, some cavity fillings that were stained have been replaced, and I am not afraid to show my teeth in my smile. And it is really exciting to know that I will continue to have improved gum health, cleaner teeth, stronger teeth! 
I would recommend visiting the dentist if you have recently quit (even for a cleaning, the cheaper choice).

How to avoid urges when socializing

Hi all, just wanted to know if this happens to someone else. I don't have any issue about no smoking when I'm not around people, when working from home or minding my own things. But when I know I'm going out with co workers or other people, my social anxiety spikes and I have a strong urge to smoke, even after no smoking for months.

Do you have any technique to stop or replace the urge to smoke in social situations?

I have no issue about quitting the habit afterwards, but I want to avoid the triggers in the first place.

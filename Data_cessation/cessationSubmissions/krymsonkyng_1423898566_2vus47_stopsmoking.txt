Tonight i did a terrible thing

Washed out after a week. Sent divorce papers off, started drinking, fell off the wagon. Hey future krymsonkyng get back on the wagon.

I hate this being my first post on here. Maybe I'm afraid of the commitment. I don't know. That's a thought for sober minds in stable times. For now i tempt zealots in more ways than one. I'll probably delete this in the mourning.

Edit: Not going to delete this. I'm going to hang on to it per some of y'alls advice. THANK YOU for encouraging this fool. I'll stick around.

Tomorrow i start fresh and i intend to use this sub for all it's worth. I'm done lurking.

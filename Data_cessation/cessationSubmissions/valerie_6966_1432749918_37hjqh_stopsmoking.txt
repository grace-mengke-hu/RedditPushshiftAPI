More reasons why I'm sticking with my quit.

1.) I hate smoking in front of children

2.) I hate smelling like smoke in front of my family when I see them, especially grandparents and small cousins

3.) I hate all of the stares I get while smoking outside of a building, anywhere. It just feels like everyone has this smug look on their face, like "fuck tht person, I'm better than they are."  That look. Yeah fuck that. 

4.) I always feels so guilty throwing the butt on the ground. It is so hideous. Another situation where I feel all eyes on me like I'm a huge asshole, which I guess I would be.

5.) being unable to enjoy a longer time period of 15 minutes while drinking without having that awful itch for a cigarette. Seriously, after 10-15 minutes of just smoking one I can't focus on anything and I don't care about anything besides lighting up another cigarette; a cigarette I don't even enjoy in the first place. 

6.) standing out in the humid intense heat and making me smell like shit, and messing up my hair and stuff from sweat and wind. Also? Standing outside when it's a fucking tundra and -20 outside. Why would I do that??

7.) not being able to breath through my nose during sleep, and a lot of other parts of the day too. Ew, mouth breathing. Has become my reality while I sleep. I've woken up so often with a desert for a mouth.. It's embarrassing. 

Yeah idk, fuck these things. I had some ragefests today that I accredit to withdrawal.. But fuck it. So worth it. I'm over these things entirely this is going to be easier than I thought. 

[edit] lol sorry, i typed this all up on my phone i didn't realize how much a trainwreck it was aesthetically. should be fixed now

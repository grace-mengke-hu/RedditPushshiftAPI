Going on Four Years

Hey y'all!

 Just found this sub. I really wanted to smoke a cigarette today, and the last few days tbh. About an hour ago I saw a picture on the front page of David Bowe smoking and the craving got  fairly intense. So I searched "is smoking that bad" and things like that only to find myself here. Thanks so much for posting here all of you, it reminds me why I once quit myself. No more coughing throughout the day. No more pain in the lungs. No more disgusting phlegm. No more burn marks on clothes and car seats. No more smelling disgusting. No more yellow teeth. No more outside in -40 to get a few puffs in. 

I smoked from 13-20 years old. Its almost been four full years now since I quit. I was easily over a pack a day smoker from 17 years old onwards, so lets say I smoked 25 cigarettes on average a day (Since I smoked daily from 13 but certainly less than that, and from 16/17 onwards a LOT more than 25 a day anyways, especially weekends or while out). Every pack was between 8.75-12 dollars. I never regularly smoked cheap brands, always top brands.

25 x 7 x 52 x 3.5 = 31,850 cigarettes NOT SMOKED thus far (try to wrap your head around that one!)
12 x365 x 3.5 = $15,330 CAD saved. WOW!

Don't give up! Totally worth it!

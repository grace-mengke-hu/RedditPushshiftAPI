Six months without cigarettes: some thoughts and reflections

Hello Reddit,

Six months ago I quit smoking. I started smoking when I was 16. Right now I'm 27 and for the last 5 years or so I smoked a big pack of cigarettes a day (about 25 cigarettes). I was quite *the* chain smoker in my circle of friends. :-)

7th May 2013 I smoked my last cigarette and things worked out great ever since although I certainly had my struggles. I thought I'd share some tips and reflections here that might be useful to other quitters. I'm not saying this is a magic formula - just some things and thoughts that worked for me.

* **1. Allen Carr:** you hear a lot about this book. I've read it 5 years ago when I tried to quit, but I failed back then. I've read it again about 7 months ago. Some reading on the topic sure doesn't hurt and the book doesn't fail to inspire, but in the end, it's still **YOU** who has to do it. The book isn't going to do anything for you. :-) I didn't even finish the book or got to the point where you should smoke your last cigarette and read on. There are two things I'll never forget about the book though. One, don't think you are *giving up* on something when you eventually smoke your last cigarette. You **stop** smoking. You **quit** smoking. You **don't** *give up* smoking, because in reality you're not giving up anything! Two, realize that smoking **CREATES** stress, rather than takes stress away. Funny anecdote also: some smoking friends laughed at me for reading a book about smoking cessation, but those same smoking friends are still smoking today.
* **2. Get active:** when I quit smoking, I was also in the process of losing a lot of weight - I lost about 60 pounds in 6 months - mainly because of running and swimming. I ran 3 days a week and I swam 2 days a week. By the time I quit smoking my weight was normal, but I continued running, because your fitness level definitely increases much faster without those nasty cigarettes. You can **feel** the improvements without cigarettes much faster and that was just fun and very motivating to me.
* **3. Get out of your comfort zone:** start doing scary things you have never done before! Like I said, I was already running a lot, so I started running longer distances than ever before. Eventually I finished some 10 miles races and even one famous half marathon. In my opinion this gives you a psychological click to fall back on in uncomfortable or stressful situations in the future: "I have ran a half marathon and I didn't needed cigarettes for that, so I don't need cigarettes now in this (stressful) situation.". Just something that worked for me, but might not work for everyone.
* **4. After 1 month:** taste buds and nose start to work again. Food tastes better again! My smell sense also improved a lot. I go to a big city every day to work and after about 2 years I finally realized how bad that city really smells. :-) But it's also very nice to finally smell things again in nature etc. Cravings are stil very present also... The smell of a cigarette can literally drive me insane to want one! From time to time, I also eat a lot in a very short timeframe. Eat so many and so many different things that my stomach just hurts. Very weird to not smoke anymore when going out, but I try to laugh at the people who are out there, smoking their stuff. Because, really, smoking cigarettes is such a stupid sight. ^^
* **5. After 3 months:** cravings are slightly disappearing and I'm getting used to a lifestyle without cigarettes. From time to time I still eat a lot in a very short time, but I haven't experienced any weight gain up to this point, because I'm also still running a lot. My lungs have improved although sometimes I still have those weird pains in my chest/lungs. Over the past 3 months I've definitely become less prone in to catching a cold or becoming sick. All the physical benefits are there, but I'm still not in that zone that makes me think that cigarettes are repulsive. Sometimes I even tell my smoking friends that I will "some day" smoke just one cigarette again. Sometimes I ask my friends that I can smell their cigarette. Sometimes I go to the garage and smell the dry tobacco of my father. There was even a moment where I was drunk and my friend were drunk and some of my smoking friends pushed a cigarette between my lips and wanted to light it, but I spit it out. Sometimes I'm just really a pathetic bastard that gets into temptation, but there's an inner force, desire that pulls me through. The first 3 months or 100 days were definitely the hardest... :-)
* **6. After 6 months:** no more cravings. Lungs are definitely improved, but I still feel like there's more room for improvement, that's also why I keep running. Another remarkable thing: even after 6 months, I don't think that cigarettes smell bad. :-) Sure, when cigarette smoke is in the car seats or clothes, then it smells. But just a cigarette in open air smells great I think (depending on the brand though). But it's not like "Mmm, I smell cookies, I want to eat a cookie!" It's more like the smell of gasoline in a gas station. There are people who think gasoline that smells bad and there are people who think gasoline smells great. But neither of them think "Mmm, I smell gasoline, I want to drink gasoline!". For me it's the same with cigarettes. Some smell great, but it doesn't trigger me anymore to want one. This was a different story during the first 3 months though. Then it really triggered me to want one. I'm really starting to think that cigarettes ARE repulsive.
* **7. Extremely funny:** how all of the sudden your smoking friends want to quit smoking too. :-) "My friend is quitting smoking, so I should quit too." "When my friend jumps in a well, I should jump too." Sorry, but I don't believe in that "quit smoking together" bullshit. "There's a train leaving and I have to catch it at all cost or I'll never get to my destination." It's not a competition. Don't start with that mindset, because you've failed by default. Some "healthy competition" might help in the first few weeks, but it's just not sustainable in the long run. Quitting smoking is about the **relationship with yourself.** The desire has to come from within **yourself.** You are not going to think "I don't touch cigarettes, because my friend isn't touching them either." for the rest of your life are you? Evil me: I've found it extremely pleasant to troll and challenge those around me who "joined" me with the wrong mindset. :-P

Hope these tips can help anyone out... In the meanwhile I'm going to keep pushing the running needle and hope to finish a marathon by the time I hit my 1 year milestone. And when I reached that point I'll consider cigarettes a closed chapter in my life.

Good luck, quitters.

Kind regards,
Broak

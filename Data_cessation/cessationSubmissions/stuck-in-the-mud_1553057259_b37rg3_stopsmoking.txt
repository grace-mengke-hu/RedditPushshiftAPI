A Long Overdue Confession

I have a deep dark secret that I've never told anyone. Though some must know, the lengths I've gone to protect this secret is embarrassing. 

For the past 6 years I've been a closet smoker. Like most smokers, I started slow and fooled myself into thinking I was in the driver's seat for a long time. Unlike most, I was a non smoker my whole life until age 28. 

I had never considered the significance of this in my smoking life until I read it on this sub. The realization was so harsh and profound, it made the hair on my neck stand up. I feel like I now hold the missing link and I absolutely must get this out to move forward. 

So here is my story. I know it's long so I don't expect many to read it all, but I'm grateful for the chance to tell it, and even more grateful that I am finally ready to share it. 

*** Chapter 1 *** 

As I think about how I got here, it's so obvious that because of my age, I began my life as a smoker with an enormous cloud of shame hanging over it. 

I started in the closet on day 1 and there I have remained. After all, how stupid must I be to pick up such a nasty hobby near age 30 in today's day and age?

My smoking ritual has never been social. It's only ever been a depressing, lonely, and exhausting one where I wallow in misery. 

I started in Spain on vacation. It was during the end of a 5 year relationship so I came back to an empty house there was all the emotional turmoil that comes with a break up. Naturally I was spending time alone working through that, only this time, I wasn't alone - I had my new friend to help me drown my sorrows. 

At work, you would never catch me at the smokers area. I did not want anyone to know that I had taken it up. Instead I took a nice long walk on my lunch break and smoked alone. 

At first, I didn't think about it throughout the day. I enjoyed my few special times and didn't mind missing it if something better came up. Obviously that didn't last. 

*** Chapter 2 *** 

It was about 2 years in when things became really miserable. By this time I was well aware I had an addiction which was proving difficult to shake. The longer I kept my secret, the harder I clung to it. This only added to the torture when I wanted to smoke but couldn't. 

Addiction is isolating and my need to hide it imposed even more isolation. In my addicted mind, I associated pleasure with being alone with my friend Nicotine. 

In year 4, a friend who was a smoker for 9 years called me to tell me she had quit and it was easy. She had no idea that I was a smoker as she no longer lived close. Writing this now has made me realize how far in the closet I really am - I couldn't even talk to a good friend who smoked about my trouble with it. 

My friend used Easy Way and has been a non smoker for 2 years now. I got my first glimmer of hope with her success. I didn't like to think about life as a permanent smoker back then, but I was in that place where you don't think about the future and just put it out of your mind entirely. 

I secretly downloaded the audio book after we hung up. I listened, loved it, and chose a time when I couldn't smoke according to my rules - vacation with family for a week. 

To my surprise it was easy and a very enjoyable week. Normally I would have been surpressing my torture and praying for the end where I could resume my double life. This time was different. 

And when I got home, I didn't start again. I was so pleased to be able to drive to and from work without even wanting to smoke. I really felt like I had done it and I was already feeling so much better. 

But about 3 weeks later, I got a metallic taste in my mouth that would not go away. I tried looking it up to reassure myself it would pass but I didn't see anyone mention it online. 

I used to think it might be in my head/anxiety but now I suspect it could have been returning taste buds, first tasting the foul chemicals remaining in my mouth, throat, lungs. Whatever it was, it made me want to buy a pack of cigarettes, which I soon did, so I fell back into the trap. 

*** Chapter 3 *** 

Even though I failed and I really wish I hadn't fallen for that trick, listening to Easy Way was still very helpful. 

It resonated with me that the pleasure was an illusion and I didn't need to smoke. I was more conscious of it after I started again. I smoked less without will power and it significantly reduced the anxiety when I couldn't. 

I never felt that intense craving the way I did before again. When I went on vacation and couldn't smoke for days, it didn't bother me. I still wanted to smoke on vacation but it didn't nag at me in the same all-consuming needy way. 

I know that the book tells you not to cut down, and that I was potentially making them seem more rewarding by saving them, but it really did shift my perception and make things more comfortable then before I read it. 

There was still plenty of self-loathing and I still wanted to stop. But it helped me make peace with the reality of my addiction and gave me hope that I could stop permanently one day, and proof that I was just fine without cigarettes. Even if you aren't ready to try, listen to this book anyway. Even though I didn't succeed, it helped me prepare to quit. 

*** Chapter 4 *** 

So these past 2 years, I have smoked. Not every single day but most of them. Not as much as before but still too much. It's been easier, but still miserable and I have no intention of continuing to slowly kill myself while I quickly turn into an old lady who looks 20 years older. 

I realized I'm about to hit my 6 year smoker anniversary (wahoo just what I had always dreamed of) and every year at this time, I long for my life before this self-inflicted gaping wound and wonder if this could be the year I finally do it.

So last week, I listened to Easy Way again. Once all the way through, and a second time while taking serious notes about my personal feelings about it all. I smoked the final cigarette on Sunday and Monday morning, I went to work and didn't smoke on my way in. 

Unfortunately, I just started a new job in a totally new field. I had a moment of intense internal panic, like I've never experienced before, and I went an hour later and bought another pack. 

This time though, I am not going to just roll over and let him win. Some break ups feel like this, where you have a lapse of judgment for a moment and run back only to realize that you know you need to cut contact because they just aren't good for you. I am not going to dwell on my relapse, instead I need to move on, and get through it. 

*** Chapter 5 ***

So last night, I was digging around this subreddit, trying to get inspired or find a nugget of insight I may not have heard, and I came across a post from a closet smoker. 

This is not a concept that I have ever considered and the words shattered my mind in half. So I looked for more from closeted smokers and read their stories. Boy did I get where they were coming from. 

It occurred to me that there is this whole other layer of emotional baggage to my smoking which I have never been able/willing to examine. This discovery felt monumental so I believe I have found the missing link for me. I didn't even realize I was missing peices but now that I have them, I am seeing the whole picture for the first time. The only thing left to do is face the whole truth. 

I am never one to compare suffering. I know all smokers have that same awful addiction and all the misery that comes with it. But I can only speak to my own experience and to that I say being a closeted smoker really sucks.  

By hiding deep in there, I've added a level of secrecy and deceit to my addiction. This has eaten away at my wellbeing in a massive way. All that lying and hiding isn't good for the soul. There is no one I can talk to about it so there is no one to cheer me on either. 

On the practical side, it is so much more expensive than just the cigarettes. I can't even tell you how much extra I've spent on scent masking, from air fresheners to dry shampoo, mints, chapstick and mouthwash. I have purchased new clothes when I'm out and realize I don't have a spare set (triple bagged). I have taken sink baths at numerous store bathrooms. I clean my car out at least once a week. I do so much laundry. 

But more importantly, it has added a layer of self-deception so deep and engrained, I didn't even see it until last night. I've been pretending to be the non smoker I was my whole life for so long, I almost believed it myself. I guess I hoped to wake up one day and discover I was just dreaming. 

Speaking of dreams, a lot of people say that when you stop, you have weird dreams about smoking. Last night after I realized all this, I had 2 vivid dreams about smoking, for the first time in my life. I am going to take that as a good sign that I'm ready. 

Now that I see it so clearly, it's time to finally fess up to what I have been unwilling to admit. Pretending like I am still and have always been a non smoker has only helped me avoid facing the whole truth and solve the problem. How can a non smoker resolve a smoking addiction? 

It pains me to say it but it's true. I am a smoker. I wasn't for most of my life but I am right now. But this doesn't mean I have to be a smoker forever. 

I know I can concentrate, cope with stress, and enjoy life much more without cigarettes because I did it for most of my life. I am scared but I shouldn't be. No way will it be as hard as keeping a phoney smile and sense of normalcy while I am secretly miserable and shackled, day after day, year after year, with not a soul to confide in. If I've survived these last 6 years of hell, this will be a peice of cake. 

I never had a shred of anxiety but now the simplest phone call to make simply can't be done without a few cigarettes to get me ready to make it. Unreal how many under appreciated side effects come from this horrible drug. 

To anyone that made it this far, thank you for lending your ear. You have no idea how good it feels to get that off my chest. I feel so much better already.

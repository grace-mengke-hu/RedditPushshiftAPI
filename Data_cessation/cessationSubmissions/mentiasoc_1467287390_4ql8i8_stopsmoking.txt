Mindfulness and science combined into a daily listening app to quit smoking

Hi all,
We know how hard it is to quit this thing. I do from personal experience, and still struggling with it.

From researching for months on how to quit smoking, we've developed Lifeboat - an app that takes you on a 45-day journey with daily listening sessions.

It's based on both mindfulness and lots of scientific findings. Mainly to break routines, build motivation and find solutions for common situations and triggers.

It's free to use for the first 15 days, give it a try: http://www.lifeboat.io/

Any feedback or experiences are very welcome of course, as we will try to increase the successrate of the app every day.

Thanks all, and good luck.

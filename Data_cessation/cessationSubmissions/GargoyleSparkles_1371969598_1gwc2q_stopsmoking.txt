100 days passed right by me...

Didn't even realize I was this far along until I opened up my QuitNow! app on my phone. Yay me!

The strangest part of all of this for me is that I've only ever had serious cravings (like, I'm going to go out and buy a pack **right now**) in the past few days. Sure, I'm stressed about packing and moving in a couple weeks, but that's nothing new.

I've been getting my life under control and it's all been awesome. I had been smoking at least a pack a day for 14 years. I had told myself many a time that I just could never quit; it was so ingrained in me. If I can do this, so can anyone.

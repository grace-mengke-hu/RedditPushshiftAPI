Help a delivery guy quit smoking

Hey guys, so to begin I haven't stopped smoking yet. My girlfriend has really been pressuring me to quit, my doctor says I need to quit, and I personally want to quit. I've tried everything... Alan Carr, patches, gum (Which was horrible), lozenges, you name it. Nothing seems to work. The hardest thing for me has always been not smoking while driving. As a delivery guy, its easy to light up after a delivery on the way back to the store. If I'm out, the store is so close to a gas station I hardly lose any time on deliveries stopping by to pick up some more. I'm going to try to quit again cold turkey, but I know with as often as I work I'll have tons of difficulty trying not to smoke while bored behind the wheel. Do you guys have any suggestions to cure this boredom, so maybe quitting will be that much easier? Thanks!

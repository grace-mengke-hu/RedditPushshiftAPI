Relapsed.

I relapsed on Saturday after a 20 day streak or so, and during these 20 days I felt better than ever, my exercise performance, and general health was significantly better.  I drank, sent a few drunk texts (to girls) which I instantly regretted, and ofcourse I felt like shit, so I said "Why not smoke a cigarette to make me feel better". Boy was that a mistake. I smoked my cigarettes, I kept smoking until today, where I felt disgusted by every cigarette I had. I threw away my last pack which had a few cigarettes in them after smoking two cigarettes in a row, and told myself, "Fuck it this is disgusting."

I'm now in a state of mind where i'm not "stopping smoking" but instead i'm "free" of smoking. I'm focusing on my exercise now. I'm done with this shitty habit. Here we go, to a new life!

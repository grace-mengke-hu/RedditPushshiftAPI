Fortnite could be your craving killer!

Seriously, games last between 5-15 mins. Just enough time for you to get pissed enough at a player for sniping you across the map from a bush. I'm on day 6 right now and literally fortnite is the only thing stopping me from going to the gas station and buying a pack. Stay strong people!

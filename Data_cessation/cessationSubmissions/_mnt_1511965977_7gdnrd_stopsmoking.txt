Need advise on strange smoking addiction pattern

I will try to make it quick. I started smoking at about the age of 16, today I am 37.

I already tried to stop smoking like a hundred times. Sometimes I smoke less, sometimes I smoke more. Never managed to stay "clean" for more than 10 days. 

Like 10 years ago, I developed the habit of only smoking a few days each week. The routine goes like that:

1. I don't smoke in the beginning of the week
2. At some point late (Wed, Thu or Fri) in the week I start smoking
3. Start feeling bad after the first few cigarettes and sleep super bad - but can't stop
3. On Friday or Saturday I go out with friends having a few beers and smoke a lot (1-2 packs)
4. Next day I have a hang over, mostly from the cirgaretts and I stop smoking until late next week.

Anybody experience with this crazy pattern? Any advise on how to break it?

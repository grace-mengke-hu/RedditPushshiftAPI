Extreme anxiety and can't seem to do day one. Please help.

For the last few months I've been smoking more and more, the last few weeks I've had some traumatic things happen and recently I've been waking up at night to smoke. My chest and throat hurt so much and I keep saying today will be the day I quit (I've quit many times before) but this time I'm almost panicking and can't seem to get through a few hours. Would be grateful for any help on here or PM. Thanks.

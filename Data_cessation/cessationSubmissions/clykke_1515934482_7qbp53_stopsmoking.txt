Help me find a video

A year or so ago I was shown a video (on youtube I believe) about quitting. I don't remember much, but I believe it was a couple of decades old and I seem to recall there was some kind of animated "nicotine monster" that the smoker kept "feeding". 

I have been looking all over, but can't find it again. Can anyone help?

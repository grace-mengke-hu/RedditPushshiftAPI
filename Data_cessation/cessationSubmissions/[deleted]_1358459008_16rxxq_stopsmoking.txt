Worried about drinking alcohol while quitting

I quit smoking on the 4th of January and so far so good. The cravings haven't even been that bad. Im really worried about drinking during this process. I haven't drank since quitting and I know that it will be my downfall. My question is, how do I stop myself from smoking when I drink/possibly becoming a little drunk? Any tips would  be great!

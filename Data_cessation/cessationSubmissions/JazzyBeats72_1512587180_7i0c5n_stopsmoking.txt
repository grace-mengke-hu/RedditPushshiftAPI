Here I go, for a better present

I started smoking when I was 17. First, only on the week ends, then everyday. At the beginning it was fun, but then I noticed like around a year after that I was hooked, and I started getting anxious because I felt I was trapped. Every time I failed I thought "oh well, I am still very young, and these are the years for me to not worry too much about my health", years go by and at least a couple times a year I would try to quit, my record is 4 months. 

Nowadays it is not about my future health, possible cancer etc. it is about my quality of life right now: I feel I have less energy, less stamina, less self-esteem, less sexual drive and I am overall more stressed. Even if I'm exaggerating, I hate thinking "I wouldn't have done that, or say that, or done better at this if I wasn't addicted". I want to feel free and myself again, like I was feeling when I was already 3/4 weeks clean and almost never felt the urge to smoke again.

So I bought my last pack, chain smoked 9 or 10 of them with some music and I threw the rest. That was like 30 mins ago. I type this to remind myself, publicly, that I am not going back.

For the record, I am Spanish, 22 y/o, I was a 5 year smoker and around 15 cigs per day.

Wish me luck, and my best wishes to anyone who's also quitting with me.

Note: by the way, how do I mark my clean days on my nickname like some redditors do around here? It would help me a bit.

Thank you!

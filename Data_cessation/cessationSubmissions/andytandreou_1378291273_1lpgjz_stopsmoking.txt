The little known benefits of stopping smoking.

It's been two days since I stopped smoking! The way I did it was to feel positive about my decision to stop (Allen Carr helped a lot). 

This reminded me about the way I stopped smoking weed. All I needed was to make my thoughts positive and think of the benefits I have coming. [This thread about the benefits of quitting weed](http://www.uncommonforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=264268&highlight=#264268) was the single biggest help in my attempt to stop, because it listed the little known benefits stopping, things that never crossed my mind but where so important in our lives. It has since become the top result in google for the search terms "quitting weed"

When did your cravings stop? (21 days in and mine are getting worse!)

Can anyone that has successfully quit smoking care to tell me that it gets worse before it gets better? 

I found the first few days easy. I quit drinking at the same time which helped, and I smoked my brains out whilst watching the Allen Carr DVD. I thought it would get easier as time went on, but ive found myself getting irritable, snapping at my girlfriend and absolutely craving a cigarette. And this is after 3 weeks. My heart is pounding at the thought of having one, i can taste it and I know it will relieve my stress*

*but I know that my stress levels will rise the second I finish that cig as my cravings kick in for another. Cheers Allen Carr! But it still doesn't stop my cravings...

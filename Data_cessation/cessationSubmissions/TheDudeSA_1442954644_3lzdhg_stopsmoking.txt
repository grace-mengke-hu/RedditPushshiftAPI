Help quitting while drinking

During the week I generally do not smoke any cigs but as soon as the weekend comes alone and I decide to drink a bit of alcohol with my friends the craving of a cigarette is strong. As soon as I get drunk i give in I i hate it. Do you guys have any tips on what could help to fight the urge.

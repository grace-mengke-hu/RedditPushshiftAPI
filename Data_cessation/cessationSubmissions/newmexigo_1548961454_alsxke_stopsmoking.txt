I know there’s never a good time to quit / it’s always a good time to quit smoking. But I’ve been so stressed recently that I feel like quitting now is hurting my mental health and job performance.

I was supposed to have a couple weeks off for the holidays the end of last year and had planned for months to quit during that time. I significantly cut back and was going to house sit for a friend between X-mas and NYE. His landlord has a strict no smoking policy on the property so I thought it was going to be the perfect time to detox and make some new good habits in my life. 
I ended up having to work through most of the holidays. 16+ hours a day, outside, by myself, so of course I ended up smoking a shit ton and used cigarettes to help keep me awake on the hour long drive back to my friends house.  
And now I’m right back into a stressful work schedule. I’m dead set on quitting and for the last 3 weeks I’ve mostly managed to stick to the JUUL but I’ll have a couple every couple days.  
But I think it’s taking a toll on my depression and is starting to hurt my job. 
I’ve been very stressed with work and having a lot of big life changes and relationship troubles. Smoking would be my normal go to for all of these. But now it’s hard to leave the house, or even get out of bed. I worry that if I go outside or drive in my truck it will just trigger me to want to smoke. I mostly work from home and on my ranch so yes, not getting out of bed is sort of an option some days. My roommate/partner is picking up some major slack for me on the ranch. And not even wanting to keep up on emails has potentially lost us some jobs and clients. 
I know quitting will be 100% worth it. Just really struggling and not sure this is the battle worth fighting right now.

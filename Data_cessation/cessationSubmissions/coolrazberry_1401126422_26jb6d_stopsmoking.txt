Advice about quitting around other smokers

Has anyone run into a problem with quitting because someone close to them still smoked? My SO and I both keep saying we want to quit, but neither one of us seems to have the will power, and we both keep enabling each other. Is there a trick anyone has learned to keep it together even if someone else can't?

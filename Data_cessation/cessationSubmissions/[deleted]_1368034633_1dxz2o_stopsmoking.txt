Today is the first day of the rest of my life.

Been a long time lurker here but at the same time was not fully ready to commit and quit. But after an insane cough attack I experienced last night, I knew enough was enough. I can't let a substance have THAT much of a control over me where I would be even thinking about smoking after last night. I did though, I went to the gas station in the morning and bought a new pack of cigs. The drive to work was dangerous as I could barely drive since I was too busy coughing my lungs out. Its safe to say that now the new pack resides in the trash bin along with all of my other "Hidden stashes" and lighters. Enough. Is. Enough. I have decided to quit smoking without the help of any other substances like chantix, e-cigs or anything of that sort. Either I quit or I continue having these scary attacks. Its a simple act and its up to me to choose what's best for me. I did however purchase Allen Carr's book through my phone. That way every time I have a craving, I can continue to read and at the same time browse this subreddit. Everyone here, so far has been an inspiration and I hope to rock the badge some of you proudly show off. This was basically a post to let "the world" know that I am getting on this wagon, and nothing will get me off of it. *Crossed fingers*

A few weeks back i googled to find out what are the chances i'd die. ITS NOT JUST MAYBE!!

I wanna start by saying its probably really hard to calculate how many smokers will actually die from it so if anyone has any more studies to add then please do.

So far i found its 24.4 percent for heavy smokers to die from "lung cancer" (heavy smokers 5 cigs or more a day)

and its 66 percent to die from any disease caused by smoking.

so you can scratch out the first number because if lung cancer doesnt get your some other bs very likely will. wtf.

my friends and i just kinda ignored it and made our selves believe that its a maybe and most likely it'll happen to someone else.

these numbers cant be right. so youre telling me more than half of people who smoke die? how the fuck is smoking a thing?

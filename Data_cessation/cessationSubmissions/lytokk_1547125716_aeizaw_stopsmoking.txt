Needing to stop with the ecig

A little over a year ago I put out my las cigarette. I had been wanting to quit for quite some time and I finally made the decision to not buy another pack, and that I would just completely switch to my blu ecig. Originally, I was going through 6 cartridges a week. Just yesterday I realized I was over double that. So right now I'm smoking the equivalency of 2 packs a day nicotene wize. 

The ecigs are just so much more convenient. No real smell, no smoke, just a small puff of vapor that dissipates quickly. But I can't afford this anymore. I made the switch with the intention of quitting, but I can't afford this $75 a week habit. 

Any idea what I can replace the oral fixation habit with? Or any advice for ecigs specifically? I have no desire for actual tobacco anymore.

Thanks.

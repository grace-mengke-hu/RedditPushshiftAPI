What makes you go back to smoking?

This is my first (hopefully last) attempt to stop smoking. It's been almost 2 weeks, with some cheating, and 3 days with no cheating.

I can easily see how people cave in the first weeks/months, but I am confused about the post saying people started again after many months/years. I would love to be prepared for whatever might happen after that long to make people go back. 

So what happened to make you start again?

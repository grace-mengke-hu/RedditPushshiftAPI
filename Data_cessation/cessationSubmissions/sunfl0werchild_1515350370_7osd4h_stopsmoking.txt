Question about rewards

So, my smoke free app says that I need to reward myself as a way to increase my willpower. Which I totally agree with, but I’m not much of a sweets person, and I’m not currently hungry at the moment and those are the types of things it suggests. Do any of you have any recommendations on what you use to reward yourself for your progress?

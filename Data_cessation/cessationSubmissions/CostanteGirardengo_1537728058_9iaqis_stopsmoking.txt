I'm quitting tomorrow!

Hello everyone.

That's right. Today is my last day as a smoker. I've been smoking for 17 years or so, smoking roughly 15 cigarettes a day. I've been wanting to quit for a long time, but now I'm finally mentally ready. I've been preparing well, reading a lot about quitting, downloaded the "Smoke Free" app, written down all the downsides of smoking and the benefits of quitting and for the last few days I've been writing in a diary about all the cigarettes I've smoked: How I felt, what it tasted like, my energy level, what I was doing meanwhile etc. This has really helped me as it's actually quite scary reading afterwards: I noticed that I got so exhausted after smoking, it never tasted good and I was always checking my phone while smoking and never really enjoyed it.

So in 2 hours I'll be smoking my last cigarette and I'm excited and proud to say so! Any good advice?

Cheers!

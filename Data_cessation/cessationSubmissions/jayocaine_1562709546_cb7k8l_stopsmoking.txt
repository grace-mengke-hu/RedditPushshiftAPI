Disconcerting input from people who quit.

You know those people who quit smoking decades ago and tell you: "Yup i still get cravings and think about cigarettes every so often, it gets easier to not act on, but you still get a craving or two".  


Is this true? Or are they just trying to scare you? Because I've heard people say they don't even think about cigarettes after 2 weeks - 2 months

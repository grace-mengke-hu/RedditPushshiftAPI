Wanting to smoke again because of all the stuff happening in my life

Hey,
Title pretty much sums it up. I smoked weed for 2 years like every weekend. So there wasn't an addiction or anything, I could stop whenever I want. 

I stopped smoking in the beginning of June, because I'm going to the army next year when I finish school, but there are test in like 3-4months which include a drug test..

Half a year ago I was really depressed and alot happend to me in that time and weed was always there for me, it helped me to stay cool and calm and forget all the stuff happening around me. Now if I look back to that time I realise that. 

My parents recently got divorced (I'm 17) and the situation is pretty fucked up. I really wanna go back to smoking and just forget everything. It used to happen something, but since last week it's happening more and more and idk what to do anymore..

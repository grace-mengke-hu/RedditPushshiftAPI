7 days in.

1/1/15 I quit. I've smoked since I was 13, I'm 28 now. This isn't the first time I quit, but this is the first time I truely wanted to quit. I went cold turkey this time around, and I must admit on day 2 I went and bought a box of smokes I sat there with an unlit cigarette in my mouth feeling ashamed of myself. But I didn't give in, I broke up the entire box and flushed it, threw out all my lighters and ashtrays. After day 3 my cravings died down a lot, now its just the habits that get me, its like I smoked after everything , like it was an award for doing normal stuff. I smoked when I woke up, drove to work, ate food, used the bathroom, took out the trash, plus my mandatory 2 daily smoke breaks! I think my biggest motivator is smelling how smokers smell for real, its disgusting and I cant believe I used to smell that way all the time. Im going to treat myself today with a Welsh's concord grape juice, since I can really really taste those grapes now.

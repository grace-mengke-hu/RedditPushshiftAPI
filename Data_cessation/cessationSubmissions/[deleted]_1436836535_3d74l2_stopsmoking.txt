Holy Euphemism! 100 days.

Everything has changed - my emotions, thoughts, and even body feel so much more "at the fore."  My heart no longer races and I'm not anxious quite as much.  I'm much hungrier than I remember from my non-smoking self, but even that is abating.

You all can do it - it's weird and difficult, but worth it.  Life become less expensive, slower, and demanding of attention.  I want everyone here to quit - you *can* do it.

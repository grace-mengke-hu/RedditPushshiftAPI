im 18 and have been smoking for two years. paint a pretty picture for me.

i started in highschool and have been smoking 1/2pack to almost 1 pack a day for far too long. my throat dosen't evenfeel sore anymore, my tounge is always dry and my voice raspy, my skin looks faded and unhealthy from years of bad sleep patterns and toxicity. 

what do i have to look forward too as a smoker in 5, 10 years... talk to me about all the beautiful women i won't have the option of dating, of all the medical problems, about why i should listen to the pictures on the boxes and not just pass them over. is life on the other side notably better?. 
              
i have always lacked discipline and need to get it fast; becoming an adult is creeping up on me fast.

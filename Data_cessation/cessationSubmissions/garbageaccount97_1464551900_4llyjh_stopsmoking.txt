i'm going to do it!

i think i'm done. just finished a pack, decided i'm not getting another. i've been hating smoking for a while. i'm 40, have 20+ pack years, it's time. 

plan is: 

* reread alan carr probably. i know you're supposed to keep smoking while reading it but i think i'm having a moment i should take advantage of
* [urge surfing](http://www.portlandpsychotherapyclinic.com/counseling/blog/riding-wave-using-mindfulness-help-cope-urges) and mindfulness to deal with not only cravings but emotional and whatever triggers
* burpees
* Dentyne gym (sticks less to teeth & dental work; fewer issues w lockjaw than other gum) 
* i do have a box of patches & mini nicotine lozenges on hand if it gets to be ridiculous. those combined helped a lot in a past quit. hoping to not need them 
* mini manicure set on hand at all times to keep hands busy and deal with nails (also an issue) 

i saw someone mention quit smoking apps, any recs for good ones for android? maybe one that has good mindfulness prompts, and something about motivation - where i could put my motivations in and be reminded of them now and then 

thanks for listening

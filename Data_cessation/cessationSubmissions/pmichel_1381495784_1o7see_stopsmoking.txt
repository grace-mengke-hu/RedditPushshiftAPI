Attitude is Everything!

Why would you mope around missing POISON??   My God, Celebrate!!    You are FREE!   Free from the slavery of always waiting for, wanting, craving the next cigarette, which makes you want the next cigarette and on and on and on.  
Freedom from the stench that surrounded you, in your clothes, in your hair, that awful taste in your mouth. 
Did you really think they calmed you down?  pepped you up?  Lies!
They destroyed your confidence, took your money and your time. Instead of calming you they made you more and more nervous. 
Come on, be real here.  Why would you miss something so insidious?  Why would you miss dosing yourself with poison?  
Celebrate being Free!!!   Feel proud, feel good.... look for and cherish all the wonderful things you are discovering, sense of smell coming back... easier breather.... more time....more money.... whiter teeth....brighter face and skin.... way more self respect. 

Stand tall, breathe deep and feel proud. 
Celebrate your freedom!!

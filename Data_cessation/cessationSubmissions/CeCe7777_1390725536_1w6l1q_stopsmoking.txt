Weight gain?

Hi everyone, I just found this subreddit, finally, somewhere to share my gross (constipation anyone?), private experiences with quitting. So it's been about 3.5 weeks and I've gained about 4 lbs. I was prepared for this and am fine with it (I was a bit underweight anyway), but hoping this doesn't continue for too much longer.  I used to never watch what I eat or exercise but since quitting, I log what I eat, do cardio 4 times a week, drink a lot of green tea etc etc. etc. So how long did it take y'all before your weight plateaued? Any tips for mitigating the weight gain (besides the obvious)?

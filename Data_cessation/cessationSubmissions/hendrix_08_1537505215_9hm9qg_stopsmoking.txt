Starting over.

I was on day 6 and I've just started happily embracing the benefits of quitting, then I relapsed out of stupidity a week ago.

I've learned that all it takes is one puff to go back – with full force – into this hell of an addiction. 

I hope that I'll survive the dreadful withdrawal.  Thank you for your inspirational posts!

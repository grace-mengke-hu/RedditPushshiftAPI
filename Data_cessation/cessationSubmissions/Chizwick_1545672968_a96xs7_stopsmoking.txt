700 Days

I really thought that it would get easier with time - and it has - but only a little bit. Holidays certainly add to the stress and the desire to go out and buy a pack. But I'm only a month away from the 2-year mark and that milestone is sometimes the only thing keeping me from breaking my streak.

I guess in a way I'm just saying that I'm thankful for this sub, if not just to view my current streak. Good luck to those of you who are just now starting to quit, and happy holidays!

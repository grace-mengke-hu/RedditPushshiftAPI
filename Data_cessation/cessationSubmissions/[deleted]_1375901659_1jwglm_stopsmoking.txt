Day 2 Report

Today is the beginning of my 3rd day not smoking, I did a report post on the first day, so I figure I'd do report on the 2nd day. The first 3 days are the hardest, I've read, because that's when all the nicotine is leaving your body.

For Day 2 I kept busy, did a lot of housework, and didn't hang out with smokers. My appetite seems back ten fold; I'm eating like crazy. It seems without cigarettes I don't STOP eating, which is good for me because I'm too skinny and need to gain some weight. 

Smoking weed helps too because I can still smoke it on my patio and get that relaxing feeling I crave.  But even then I don't stay on my patio for long. I find I am already much more productive, I am doing a lot more things (even stoned) than when I was a smoker and taking a "5 minute cigg break" every 30 minutes.

Today is Day 3 so I'm going to try to just rush through it again. I think tomorrow will be much easier. Just going to stay away from it, if I can, and smoke weed and give myself treats like mandarin oranges (which really helps for some reason) and doing whatever I want. :) Completely doing whatever my body wants (besides cigarettes) so that I can keep my mind busy.

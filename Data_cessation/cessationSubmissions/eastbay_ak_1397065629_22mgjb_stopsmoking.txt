my third first day of quits help me

hi guys. i am in the process of  quit. i've previously attempted quitting and longest i made it was a week. I have NO IDEA how i made it a week before. 

I would like to know if anyone else had similar withdrawals as I am going through. I feel like i am in a sober dream state all day, i am SUPER tired. I feel like i could stretch and yawn non stop. I am totally anxious. My mind is wandering all over the place. I have the WEIRDEST chills like I am not shaking, but it feels like I'm shaking all the time.
 and  the worst part is that I work on my laptop all day and I can't type consistently and accurately.

But u know besides all my bitching I am quitting for sure. I realize that the temporary stress relief and pleasure i get is not relief or pleasure at all, but just my nicotine craving going away temporarily. 

AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: IT WOULDNT HURT TO HAVE JUST 1 CIGARETTE WOULD IT ..... NO NO NO NO NO

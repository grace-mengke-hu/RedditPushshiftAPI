24 days no cig, breathing problems come and go

I get this random shortness of breath that can be cured by yawning momentarily for a few minutes, then I feel the need to yawn again. My first week stopping cigs it was bad, then progressively got better, till one day I tried my friends vape pen just once, then the day after the next, it started happening again l, and it got worse, and progressively started getting better to where I didn't even think about it over a day or 2 (only a few times it would happen, nothing crazy), felt like I was breathing fine, until today I got I'm my car leaving work, walked out the building and smelled a ciggerate and it started happening slightly, but then sitting in my car for a hour where I would usually have 2 cigs, it started to get worse slowly, but now I'm feeling better, does anyone know what this might be, I'm thinking it's still my brain trying to recover from cold turkey, and sometimes triggers like eating, or driving make it start happening again is what I'm assuming? Please any but of info will help, I drink a 12oz Redbull everyday btw

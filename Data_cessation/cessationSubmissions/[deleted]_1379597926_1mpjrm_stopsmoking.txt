Day 1... again.

Today is the day... funny how many times I told myself this in the past 6 months.

A little bit of background: Smoked since I was 18 (I am 25 now). Decided in february this year to quit, mainly for finacial reasons and it went pretty well. It was not easy but pretty much easier than I thought. But, c'est la vie, had a real nasty day at work and asked for a cig. Two months of progress and self-discipline for nothing. Began to smoke on a regular basis and smoked even more than before. Since then I half-assing tried to quit, always asking myself how i done it in the first place. Maybe any of you can relate to that.

But today I hope I'm prepared. I bought enogh gums for weeks (normal chewing gum, no nicotine substitute, helped me on my first try by keeping the mouth busy). I read Alan Carr and think his argumentation is very useful. I have enough work to keep my mind busy, but also enough freetime to prevent stressing myself out.

Well... smoking my last cig now. Wish me luck and many thanks for reading.

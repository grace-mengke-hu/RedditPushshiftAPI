3rd day done! Things Ive noticed.

Every moment I feel like I am forgetting something or like something is missing. I know what it is but that feeling is so hard to explain. I haven't slipped up at all and have no urges to.  I do find myself thinking about it at certain times and one time actually forgetting I quit for a second and reaching for my pack of cigs. Fkn facepalm!

But so far its been alot easier than I thought. I've used about 5 lozenges on the third day and I plan to use four today. I wont hate myself if I have to use five. I will be going down to the 2mg lozenges in a few more days. eventually I will break those in half and then just stop. I plan to keep some around after I stop for those unpredictable stress times, I figure its better than smoking.
Still GUNG HO! In my mind I feel like I've already beaten it.

Does anybody have any suggestions on smoking app?

I,m almost through day six now and was wondering does anybody know of an app that takes tobacco in to account. I installed QuitNow! but the only options that are lists are how many did you smoke per day and price per packet. When i was smoking i  didn't know the exact amount i smoked per day, I spend E33.50 for 75g and that got me through the week.

7 days in and I had an incredibly stressful day at work...

I walked up to the counter to buy some cigarettes and all I could think about was the shame and self loathing I would feel if I bought them. Ive only seriously quit once before and it lasted 2 weeks before I bought them again. I hated myself for breaking my streak and it completely ruined the cigarette for me anyhow. Not this time.

Opinion on weed for exsmokers?

Off the smokes 3 weeks (using Allen Carr) feeling pretty great!

However, I wanted to know people's opinions on weed for ex smokers? I rarely smoke it anyway but on occasion it's a nice little treat (legal where I live) - when I say little I mean like a two hitter. My friends usually smoke it with tobacco so I have completely avoided it to this point, but I was wondering what the opinion is on smoking it pure? I worry about the ritual of it being too similar to smoking tobacco and triggering something/relapse....

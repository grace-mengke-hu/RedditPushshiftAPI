Finally after 30 yrs I now have 1 week

I have been clean and sober for 28 yrs, that was the easy addiction compared to the nicotine, like Heroin sticks. I smoked about a pack and a half a day. Not ever willing to take the 1st step and admit how unmanageable my life is. I took Chantix for two weeks that helped me out but there are side effects that I don't like so I quite taking.  I have an app on my phone helps me too.

It was hard.

It was hard doing what I had to do in order to be healthy. Really, really hard. I had a lot of ups and downs with life that tempted me like no other. Family passing away. Losing jobs. Losing friends. Losing lovers. 

I'm going to give you all a quote today to remind you all, of the strength you personally have. 

“Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!”

Life is going to hit you, hard. It's going to keep hitting you. 

But you're going to get back up. 

Every. Single. Time. 

And you're going to realize that you are going to be okay. 

Never let your self rest face down in the dirt and admit defeat. When the chips are down and everything seems pointless, so you just want to light one to take all of your stress away. 

It's a trick, and it does nothing but prove how weak you can be. 

Prove your self wrong. 

Win.

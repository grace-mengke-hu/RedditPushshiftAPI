Day 7 with no smokes...but with a sick twist

The 'sick' twist is in fact quite literal.

One week ago from today i got really sick, I'm talking both ends here people. It lasted for about 5 days. And obviously, throughout the ordeal, I didn't really crave a dart (I've smoked for 5 years) and now I'm starting to think I have accidentally quit.

Woah.

What.

Is this a real thing? Can you literally vomit away the desire to smoke or this all a temporary tease?

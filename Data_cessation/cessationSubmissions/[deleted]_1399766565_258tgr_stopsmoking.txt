Stop smoking is bad, but stress is worst

Jeanne Calment (longest confirmed human lifespan in history) smoked until she was 117 years old. she smoked 2 a day in her later years. She lived a stress free life. I am not advocating smoking, but many posters here are super stressed, Even if you quit smoking, if you live a stress life, you will get cancer and die before your time. So if you are going to quit, stop complaining and make sure you life happy and stress free, that is the secret to a long life. Stress is worst than cigarettes. Also, if you quit smoking but continue to eat junk food, drink coffee, and don't enjoy and love you job...then what is the point of quitting smoking? Smoking is not the enemy people! start living your dream, get a job you love, start eating healthy, exercise, and quit smoking if you want...but live a happy life, get rid of toxic friendships, get rid of toxic relationships, get real!

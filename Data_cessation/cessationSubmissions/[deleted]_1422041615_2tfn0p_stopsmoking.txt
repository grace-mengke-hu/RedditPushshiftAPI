Lungs hurting

So I had my last cigarette on New Years. The first week sucked and my lungs hurt and i was coughing and it was hard to breathe as expected. Then it went away. Not even having any cravings. But now 3 weeks later it has returned worse than ever. I haven't really been coughing and it doesn't seem like anything is coming up. Is that normal for it to go away and then come back? And how long does this last?

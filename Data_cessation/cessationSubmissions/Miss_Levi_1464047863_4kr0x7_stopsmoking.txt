Depression seems to linger

It has been three weeks. I go days without even thinking about cigs but the first week was killer one for me. I can smoke and drink at my job so I'm  still around smoke and drinks can make it harder. The first week I was on antibiotics so there were three days no smoking and no drinking. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE!  I found out I needed a biopsy to check for cervical cancer which is why I quit in the first place. So lets say emotions were high. First week was filled with mental breakdowns, mild and light. Now that three weeks have past and I've started an exciting new job and quit my shitty old one I'm wondering why Im still feeling run down and sensitive. I don't want the depression from my withdrawals to linger. Has this happened to anyone else? When did you see emotional improvement? What can I do to aid it?

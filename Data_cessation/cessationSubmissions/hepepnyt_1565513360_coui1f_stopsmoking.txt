How to rewire brain and outlive psychological craving

Psychological addiction and that temptation to puff just one more time is so present event after months, years after you quit.

What are some best ways how to suppress temptation?

*  It helps to think about overcoming all those hard first days if I smoke again,
* thinking about burnt money for cigaretts,
* just medidate very easily for 5 minutes and then telling myself that if I had smoke, it would be over now,
* pushups at home, walk when outside,
* buying some sweet.

A lot of these things help me, but none is as strong as craving. I would probably need something which could make me hate cigaretts from start to end to be cured really.

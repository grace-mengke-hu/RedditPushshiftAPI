It's been two weeks since my birthday...

I quit on my birthday two weeks ago as a birthday present to myself. The first week was probably the hardest. At this point, it isn't too difficult. It's just the little things at this point--the morning cigarette with a cup of coffee. Or the first one after a few beers. But I've made it this far, and I have sworn to never touch another one! I frequent this sub everyday because it's helped me so much! Thanks all!

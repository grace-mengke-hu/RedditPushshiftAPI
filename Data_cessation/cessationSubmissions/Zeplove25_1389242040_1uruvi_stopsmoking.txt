52 days

Today was day 52.
To be honest this whole time when people have asked me how quitting was going, i used to get irritated. I wanted a cigarette - thats how it was going. I didnt see any benefits other than the money. Tonight I ran. On a treadmill. For 45 minutes. No "sandpaper lungs".  I can finally see the benefits. Even though i think about it every day, and still want one. I just know i wont. I hope the time comes when i dont think about it anymore. Thanks for all the support. Even just reading all these posts have helped immensely.

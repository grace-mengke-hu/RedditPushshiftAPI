Need some advice

Hey guys! I’ve just finished reading EASYWAY by Allen Carr and I really want to quit. I’m 24, been smoking for the past 3 years. 

I thought that today was gonna be the day, but I’ve been thinking about quitting on Sunday, and have a last weekend with this shit. But I’ve been almost 12 hours clean, and I feel so confused about what to do...

What do you think?

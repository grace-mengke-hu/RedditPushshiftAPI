Update: My son needs this.

I had my wisdom teeth surgery this afternoon and my mouth is just now beginning to feel sensation.  
The surgery went well and the pain isn't too bad.  
  
I decided, on the way to the appointment, to stop and get a 2 week supply of step 2 patches in order to preserve my sanity and my husband's. I haven't put one on yet, and I won't until tomorrow morning. I STILL WENT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON WITHOUT A CIGARETTE...from about noon until the present.  
  
I'm not going to fib, the desire for one is there...and it's heavy...but I looked down at my son at the last nursing session before surgery and told/promised him that *this* would be the last stinky, nasty nursing he would have from me. From here on out, I would be comfy, fresh, and clean for him. I keep reminding myself of this and the joy that it will bring both of us.  
  
Thank y'all so much for your hope, support, and love. I'm actually excited to start this journey and I feel like I'll have plenty of comrades throughout all of this.  Y'all are an amazing resource to have. Xoxo!

Question about second hand smoke

Today, i was exposed to 2 hours of second hand smoke at a gaming cafe. Unfortunately, the door which led to the outdoor area where people smoke was close to our pc's. Everytime it opened i would get exposed. Don't think this is the right subreddit but i was wondering, what are the implications of this exposure? Did some reading but it seems to be about long term exposure to second hand smoke. Would appreciate the help, thanks.

Almost had one today->Damn 616!

Got into a fight with my girl today, and for a brief moment I considered walking into the store to get a pack. I wasn't going to fool myself with just one. I mean come on. 

I didn't. 

Things somewhat smoothed out and I didn't. 

I quit via e-cigs. I haven't used those as a crutch since my 6 month. I don't even think about them (smokes) anymore unless I'm stressed. Drinking is easy. Stress sucks. 

I'm not gonna have one tonight or anytime soon. 

I just randomly hopped on reddit tonight and saw this subreddit. 

Curiously I wandered in and saw that I was at 616 days. Feels great. 

If anyone reads this at all. Keep going. It's worth it. You only have one life. Appreciate it the best you can. You won't get another shot.

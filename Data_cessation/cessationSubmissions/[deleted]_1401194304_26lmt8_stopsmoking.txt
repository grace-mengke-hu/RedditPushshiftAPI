25 Days...feeling strong and happy.

It's been 25 days since I last held a cigarette in my fingers (Unfortunately I have been exposed to the smell..yuck!). Roughly 3 weeks ago I replaced my cigarettes with a pair of running sneakers. Yesterday I jogged/walked a total of 2.79 miles. I got prompted to sign up for a 5k. I get paid on Friday. Instead of using that money to buy another pack of cigs, I will be using that money to sign up for my first 5k. 

To all the first day quitters out there (or even the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.), it does get easier. You can do this. It's all about showing that cigarette who is in charge. You are stronger than a stick of tobacco and paper. Keep at it and soon you will feel like the chains have been broken for good.

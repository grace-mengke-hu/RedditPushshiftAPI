Replacing tobacco with weed?

Hey, new sub here, and I'm sure this question has been asked before, but please humor me. 

Been smoking for 4 years, pack a day. I'm tired of it and a friend suggested this sub for me. Already 20 pages in to Carr's book as of 30 mins ago. I plan on finishing it, but I was wondering about others success in replacing tobacco with weed? Used to be a heavy toker, and I've recently cut back a lot. What are y'alls experiences?
Thanks!

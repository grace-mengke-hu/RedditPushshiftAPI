I want to stop

Well as it turns out cigarrettes and me have like a very awful love-hate relationship. When i smoke i hate it, when i quit i miss/need it. I wanna quit now. 

Anyone else has this kid of feeling? 

I'll just drop it and pretend it doesn't exist, i smoke mostly out of anxiety, same deal with food i'll try to turn to water for anxiety but it doesn't taste that good haha.

I'm here to request for support, when my anxiety strikes i'll come here and write it up. Maybe i can help ppl going through the same thing or maybe just get help. Thanks folks, i'll be seeing you around.

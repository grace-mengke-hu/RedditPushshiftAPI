Help, need advice on healing

Well, it's been about 5 months since I quit, but my throat, my chest, my lungs... they feel utterly destroyed.

I go to the gym, I do cardio, try to eat right, but damn... the damage just doesn't seem to be going away! It's maddening!

I'm wondering if anyone has fully recovered their lungs after years of smoking. I'm so tired of my shitty lungs, help.

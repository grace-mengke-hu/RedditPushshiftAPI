Quitting nicotine but keep having to nap around 6pm?

I've been using Swedish snus for about 6 months now, and have recently come to the realization that it's been 6 months...this isn't a "oh I'll try it once" anymore. I could see this going the wrong way fast.

So, I decided to quit. The first time (2 months ago), I just put it down. Then in January, I went back. Said to myself, last can. Bought another. Just going to use it on the weekends. Using half the days of the week.

Stopped and threw it out last Sunday morning. So it's been 4 days. I've definitely been moody, having some night sweats, and some issues falling asleep. Funny thing is, I've noticed this all over the past month or so if I didn't use for a few days. So I'm guessing it's indeed withdrawal.

Anyways, I've also noticed that I get this huge urge to nap around 6pm every day lately. It's brutal. It's gotten a little better, but not by much. Sometimes having some sugar (like an apple) helps. I found this article, as well as many others saying they were very fatigued for a while after quitting [much longer habits]:

Is it likely related, and when can I expect it to ease up a bit? It's still so bad that I have to plan to be done with my day's work by 6, and to not drive until I bounce back (usually a few hours later, right before bed).

Day 2 of no smoking.

Got through New Years Day with not one actual cigarette, after about 4 years of smoking half a pack or less per day.  Just started the habit 4 years ago, at age 39.5.  Now into day 2, lightly vaping a Mark 10, but I feel like it's progress.  Also, I'm broke, so can't afford the real thing.  Never really smoked regular cigarettes that much, always smoking something like this https://www.cheaplittlecigars.com/Cheyenne-Filtered-Cigars-Vanilla_p_2510.html

I am quitting because it's the first of the year, and I have overall fitness goals to attain.  It's tough.  I have the urge to smoke, but the will to be healthier in 2019 is stronger.  I expect it will be very challenging to avoid this crap for a long time, but I hope the urge wains a bit after a week or 2.  Thanks for this reddit!

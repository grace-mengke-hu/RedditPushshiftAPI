Day One

I’ve tried to quit many times, some successful more not. Even the successful attempts where I got a few months I ended up picking up a cigarette again eventually.

Today is day one, once again... I woke up this morning without a pack and when I went out for coffee this morning, I just decided not to buy another today. It was easy for some reason, hard to explain...

Now the day is almost over, still haven’t broke down. I’m not feeling regretful or having any withdrawal, or maybe I am but I’ve gotten far enough to just get through it. The mild discomfort of nicotine withdrawal isn’t as bad as dealing with the curse of smoking the rest of my life.

Posting up on reddit to try and give myself some accountability, though obviously very little since this is anonymous. This community is inspiring and has kept the idea of quitting at the top of my mind for a while, so thanks to all you people for sticking with it.

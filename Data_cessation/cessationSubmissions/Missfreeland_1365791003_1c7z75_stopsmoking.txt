So here it goes

A few days ago I went to the gym on a whim, and the feeling in my lungs pushed me enough to not only want to stop smoking but I feel like I NEED to. That same day I downloaded Allen Carr's book to read seeing as I've tried quitting before and only made it a few months. Ever since then every time I light up I hate a little bit more of myself. His tricky rule about not extinguishing your last cigarette until AFTER you've finished the book is very smart. Every single cigarette I've had since I started reading makes me sick. I can taste how awful they are, how horrible they make me feel mentally, physically and emotionally. Right now I hate myself. I want to quit, but even when reading this book I'm still scared. Thinking about the future is stressing me out, and I don't think I can take failing another time.

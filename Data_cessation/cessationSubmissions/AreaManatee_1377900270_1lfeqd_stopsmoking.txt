So this whole badge thing

Is pretty great. I subscribed to this subreddit/got a badge, one night when I was completely drunk. barely remembered in the morning except when I saw posts coming up from /r/stopsmoking. Weird, I thought, but whatever it takes. Now I can look back at this and see how long it's *actually* been.

This is the first time I've ever quit with a support group, or something similar. The weird thing is too, I'm the only person I know who smokes where I live. Thanks /r/stopsmoking. 

Cheers!

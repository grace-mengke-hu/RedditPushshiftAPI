It's only been 40 days.

I quit using the ecig, which I only used for 3 days. Now I've been without either for 40 days. 

I still have cravings first thing in the morning, and the worst is usually around 3 PM. I smoked for 13 years and I'm 30. Is there a way to beat the cravings? I'm not satisfying them, but is there a way to get rid of the scratchy feeling in my throat. 

I smoked Marlboro Menthols Full Flavor shorts.

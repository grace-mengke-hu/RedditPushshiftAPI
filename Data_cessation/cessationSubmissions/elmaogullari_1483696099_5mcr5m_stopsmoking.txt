One bite at a time ?

“How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.”

It’s an expression you’ve probably heard. When we are talking quitting from a habit it’s totally wrong. We are trying to grow an elephant not to eat one. 
Your struggle with smoke will get easier but will never end.

Why I am here so then ? Just to say that "You are not alone. You are not the single guy/gal who stops smoking. First and foremost IT IS ACHIEVABLE. "  

Keep on walking .

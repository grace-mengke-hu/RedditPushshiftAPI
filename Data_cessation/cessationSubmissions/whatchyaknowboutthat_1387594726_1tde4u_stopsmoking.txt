It's been a little over an easy two months of not smoking and now, I've been hit with extreme cravings...

So I quit smoking about 2 months ago and I have to say it was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. The decision to quit was a relief because the health risks terrified me but it was really financial trouble that really convinced me to stop. Quitting (the first time I tried) turned out to be surprisingly easy. Anytime I ever had the desire to smoke I'd remind myself why I quit and how smoking was always something I hated doing and no craving was worth the joy I have been feeling from NOT smoking. Now, two months later, all I can think about is ripping a cigarette out of someones hand and keeping it for myself. My brain is trying so hard to rationalize having just one cigarette but I know that would for sure ruin me. I haven't relapsed and I don't think I will (hopefully) but why the sudden cravings? They haven't been this strong since I quit. Any insight would be appreciated...I would also like to say that this subreddit has been a positive reinforcement that has helped me stay nicotine free and I can't thank you guys enough for that :).

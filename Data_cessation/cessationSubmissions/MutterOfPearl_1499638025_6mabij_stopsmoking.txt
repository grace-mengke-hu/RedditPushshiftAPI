Tomorrow is my quit date!

I'm done with this disgusting, filthy, smelly habit. Tomorrow is the day!

I quit once before for 8 years, so I know I can do it. I hate that I let myself slip back into it.  I've been smoking again for at least 2 years and it's time to be done. Hopefully, for good. 

I've been lurking this sub for a while and I'm encouraged to see such a positive and uplifting group. Thank you for being here!

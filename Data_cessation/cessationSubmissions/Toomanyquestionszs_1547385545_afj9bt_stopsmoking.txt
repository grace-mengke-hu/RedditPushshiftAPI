I'm a little past two weeks, starting to really break me down. Need sleep advice badly

Hey all as the title says I'm just a little bit passed two weeks now. I smoked for 5 years and anywhere from half pack to full pack each day. 

I have a ton of family stress happening so I just dropped the smokes. It's actually not been too hard. I think it's because i cant tell the different from quitting stress or family stress.

Anyways fast forward to three days ago. Cravings got like 60x worst. I have also always had insomnia but my sleep is super shit now. My sleep pattern follows,

Fall asleep around 11-12:30 after reading
Wake up around 2-3:30am 

From here I may fall back to sleep only to wake up 4-6 more times until I give up around 5.

Or I just cant fall back to sleep.  I'm always gonna have a hard time sleeping, but lately it's obvious it's because I really want a smoke. Anyways anyone have sleeping tips, also when will these craving die down again

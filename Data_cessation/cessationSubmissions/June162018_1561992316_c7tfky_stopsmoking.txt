Took another step to kill the routine

I always tried to minimize the effect of smoke to the clothes i was wearing. I have had this long relatively light winter coat that i wore ALL THE TIME...except summer obviously. But it was like a designated smoking coat and the one i used to take my dog for walks in the elements. Loved that damn coat because it was durable as hell and it lasted about 10 years. 


Well, i just threw it out yesterday because i realized it was a crutch. It was part of my routine getting home to throw it on, feel for the lighter in my pocket, and go outside. I already got a new winter coat a couple months ago to prepare for this moment but it took me this long to finally do it!

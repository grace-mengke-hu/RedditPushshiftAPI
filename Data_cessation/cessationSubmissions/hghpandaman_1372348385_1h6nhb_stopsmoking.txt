Its been a week!!!!

So this is probably the longest i've gone without a smoke for in quite a long time! Thank you all for all your support! I'm having some typical withdrawal effect, sore throat started today with a pretty nasty cough, and I've also found myself insanely (and i mean INSANELY) sensitive to caffeine since I've stopped.

Thanks again for all of your support! I don't think I could've made it here without reading through everyones posts during my cravings. Keep on quitting everyone!!

15 days cold turkey! What's on my mind:

The first day is the toughest. Not the day itself, but the decision to stop. I remember smoking an entire pack the day before and telling to myself it was over, it was a huge help, paradoxically. But I knew that night I wasn't going to smoke the day after.



I didn't leave the house for the first two days. Then I had to work. Then friends invited me to go out. I just did my routines without cigarettes, and I knew what to expect. For a couple of seconds, my brain was going to make me feel empty so I had to smoke. I knew the feeling already, so I ignored it and - the important part - focused on the positives:



I could already feel my mouth again. I could taste. My nose was better, I didn't smell like crap, I could hug my parents without shame again. I took deep breathes - I was afraid of doing that as a smoker, because it reminded me how out of shape I was. I started to look for gym memberships, I can finally get in shape, run, lift, whatever I want. 


The trick for me is to think about the positives, and they clearly outweigh the "negatives" of stopping - there aren't any, just that stupid brain addiction. 


Just wanted to share, thanks!

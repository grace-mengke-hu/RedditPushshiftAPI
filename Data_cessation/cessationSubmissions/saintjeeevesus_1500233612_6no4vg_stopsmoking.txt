I haven't smoked a cigarette since last night around midnight.

I am begging myself mentally every day to quit, i truly need to, it is affecting me terribly. i am twenty four and have been smoking since 17-18 and have to deal with constantly clearning my throat to speak or sing and sometimes have a difficult time catching my breath.  i just had a little girl in January,  and her father hadnt been very emotionally supportive, the polar opposite honestly,  so to deal with my stressors i smoke... But recently a physical altercation occured and things are even more difficult than ever, and i want to smoke every chance i get, i feel morbidly depressed... But i have to quit, i am trying to prevent myself from smoking again and that would require me to keep myself from becoming over emotional, smoking is ny go to when i am sad or deep in thought.     so i am sort of just asking any tips or tricks to prevent me from taking steps backwards rather than forward. anyone and everyone,  any tipsncould help. in advance, thank you!!

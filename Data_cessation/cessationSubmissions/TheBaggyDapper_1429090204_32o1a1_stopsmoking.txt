Smug Bastard

Had to do my first medical for work since I  quit today. 

Anyone ever do a Spiro? It measures lung elasticity and is torturous for a smoker. You have to blow, blow and when you feel your lungs empty then you have to blow more. First time I ever got it within normal range. 

Then the Physio asked what exercise I do, said it was obvious from my cardiovascular results that I do some. The only exercise I actively pursue is drinking and I don't think that counts. 

And last one up was the doctor who told me I have an athlete's physique. 

It's nice to walk out the door afterwards without  feeling shit. [/smug]

Tomorrow is the day.

Well tomorrow is the day. Any advice? Going cold turkey for the first time. This time will be different than the past. I'm forced to quit smoking this time. I have a job that has a strict no smoking or nicotine policy and I have a test for it coming up in a few weeks. I hope knowing that I must quit to get this job helps. Any advice and tips that have helped you guys in the past??

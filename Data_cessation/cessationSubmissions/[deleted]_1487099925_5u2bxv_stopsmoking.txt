44 DAYS! NY Resolution :)

Hi Guys,

Haven't smoked a single stick this year.
Here are some things I want to share.

1. It is Easy.
2. Read Allen Carr's book.
3. Tobacco Industry is satan personified. (Watch John Oliver on tobacco)
4. No matter how many days, you will have psychological cravings.
5. Craving will be for 10 seconds, if you get past that, you are  good.

It has not been a struggle, It has been quite easy. I watched several documentaries. But more importantly Allen Carr has been wonderful. I suggest all of you to read it.

Whatever problems you have in life, smoking is not the answer. 

It is not a crutch.
It does not give you confidence. (which we have brainwashed to believe)
It is not needed to socialize. Talk to the fucking person,ask them deep questions.That's how you socialize, not talking petty things over a shitty smoke time.
You can have alcohol without smoke, although be very careful here, because it is a dangerous road to tread. Drink moderately.

Hope this helps guys, Stop THE shit and inspire others to stop.
Peace <3

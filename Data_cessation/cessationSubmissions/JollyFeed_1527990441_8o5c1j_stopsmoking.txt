Completed Day Two!

Made it another day. It wasn't too bad. I haven't been focused on cigarettes and smoking. The lozenges are helping because I don't think about going and buying a pack. I'm not counting down the hours since the last cigarette. I know 4 mg of nicotine in the lozenge will take care of the most intense craving considering there's only 1\-2 mg per cigarette. It really has helped take the edge off. I spent most of the day delaying using a lozenge. I've stretched out the time between lozenges to only need one a few hours after waking up \(after having a cup of coffee and a meal, plus one hour for good measure\) and in the evening after dusk. I'm digging the progress I've made.

Felt better when smoking ðŸ™ƒ

I know it's temporary. The crud

8 days 9 hours and 15 minutes into the quit. Have managed to get by some serious cravings, though barely ...or so it seemed. Even was with smokers last night and made it out smoke free

But I feel like crap. Tired. Sorta idk body sick. Eyes are gummy. Working out has been rough motivation wise. I feel weak and slow

I've read it can take up to a month+ to get by this crud feeling. True? Common?

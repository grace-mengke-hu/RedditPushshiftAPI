The Smoking Hypocrite

Not really sure where else to go with this, but want to just get it off my chest and get any advice if someone has been in a similar spot and kept with quitting.

I'm in my late 20s, been smoking for 10 years, maybe 4 a day for the past couple. However - always in secret. I'm sure some people have caught on, but limit it to morning, maybe lunch, then 2 or so in the evening. I'll drive somewhere away from my place, put on a jacket, then afterwards washing my face, hands, brushing teeth, etc its become this whole ritualized process that feels pretty insane. I'll even usually throw away the whole pack and lighter by the end of the day, only to restart the next day.

Outside of this - a lot of my identity is tied up in being a healthy, outdoorsy guy- run 40+ miles a week, hike, climb mountains, bike, watch what I eat, etc. I keep on thinking the incompatibility between those and smoking will help me kick it, but it almost feels the opposite - it stops me from being a heavy smoker, but the cycle of loads of shame / anxiety about it, then 'escaping' to go smoke, then guilt, and repeat, seems to make it really mentally tough (feels more like a mental thing than a physical craving)

Really want to quit, but clearly on some level I don't, and can't figure out what I'm worried about losing by quitting

8 days

this week hasn't really been a struggle tbh, kind of just forgetting about cigarettes. However today I'm bored, excessively bored and I just keep thinking about them as something to do, I'm not going to smoke, it's just annoying how prevalent this thought has been for the past few hours. I don't feel much healthier either, I remember last time I quit, I felt better every day, but my lungs and throat ache, has anyone else had this sensation?

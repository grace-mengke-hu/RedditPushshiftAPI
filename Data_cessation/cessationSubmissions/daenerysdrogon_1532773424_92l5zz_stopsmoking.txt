2 weeks!

Today (its 2am so technically yesterday) I found a pack in my car along and it was the first time since I’ve quit that I’ve had THAT much access to cigarettes, let alone even being that close to them. As weird as it is, I smelled them in the pack just out of curiosity and It was vile. So despite being in the car in traffic, knowing cigarettes were in the glove box I prevailed! I’m so happy. I cannot believe how little I think of cigarettes in general now compared to 9 days ago when I was on this sub losing my mind. Yay!

Success kid: Broke up with girlfriend, will not smoke.

Last week, my long term girlfriend and I broke up. I am a former smoker who hasn't smoked in three months, and I intend to keep it that way. She was a big part of my quitting, and while my scumbagbrain instantly said 'Ooh, that's rough, you should smoke. Afterall, you quit for her, right?', my higher self has been able to say "No, I quit for myself. You got this". 

Life is always going to be throwing us situations and say 'make something of this', and now's my opportunity to achieve things I could only achieve while single AND smoke free. 

This is my first post, but I've been following you guys and gals for the past few months. Your trials and tribulations ultimately helped me quit smoking AND stay smoke free, and I think you're all awesome people! 

Keep up the fight!

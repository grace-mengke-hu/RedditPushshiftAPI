I've eeked my way to an all-time best! Now what?!?

Today is my 23rd day (also 38 of the last 44 days) cold turkey. I'm pleased with my efforts but I must admit that the last few days have been very tough. I contemplated self-sabotage a few times when I smelled cigarettes from people in public. The only thing that kept me going was my desire to break my record. Right now, a part of me is wanting to go out and smoke. Of course, I have more milestones I'd like to hit (30 days and 40 days) so I'll likely resist the temptation for the next week at least. Also, I am more conscious of the fact that the joy of a cigarette is somewhat illusory. Nonetheless, I'm not feeling super-strong; just hanging in there.

I'm going to need more than arbitrary milestones to keep this going in the long run. Give me something! Anything!

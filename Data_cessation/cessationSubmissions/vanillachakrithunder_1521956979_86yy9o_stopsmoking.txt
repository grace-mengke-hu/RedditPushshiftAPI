Relapsing seems inevitable.

I started smoking when I was 12 and quit 2 months and 24 days ago. From the age of 13-18, I smoked 2-4 packs a day. I'm 21 and I feel like there's no way I will keep this up for the rest of my life. Relapsing seems inevitable. 
I keep telling myself that It's okay, it's gonna be fine If I start again and I will quit later on in life. I keep telling myself no smoker quits at this age. Most of the people who have actually successfully quit are in their 30's, and they seem fine so I should do the same. 
I miss the smoke circles. I miss catching up with friends over the phone while enjoying a smoke. 

I know most of this is my addiction trying to trick me and the rest is just dumb and irrational reasoning. 

Thanks for taking the time to read!

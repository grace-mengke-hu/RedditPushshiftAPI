32 hours into quitting

Hello, 

I quit smoking a little over 32 hours ago and I've been hearing that it's best to have a support system in place. I'm using the gum, which is helping, but I'm finding myself with some intense cravings. I guess I would just like to have some people to chat with because most people I know haven't smoked, or never really had a problem quitting.

Just ran out and I'm to lazy to go get some more.

Just doesn't seems worth it. I mean what's the point of sucking on a piece of paper covered in chemicals and sucking smoke through a chemical filled fiberglass tube? Wasting my money slowly killing myself, last time I checked I didn't have a death wish. But with cigarettes that's what I'm doing. Fuck that. Seriously fuck that. I've probably spent over 100k buying smokes. I could of gone to Europe or Asia for that 3 times over for that. Is going to be easy? Yes and no. Yes because I want it so freaking bad and no because my body and my brain are jackasses. Well lets move forward shall we people!

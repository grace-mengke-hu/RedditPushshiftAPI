One Week Free! But still have a headache :(

Anybody else get headaches for this long? I haven't had a cigarette for a week but have had  pretty constant annoying pressure in my temples this whole time. Anything i can do? I've been drinking lots of water and eating fruit but it doesn't seem to help!

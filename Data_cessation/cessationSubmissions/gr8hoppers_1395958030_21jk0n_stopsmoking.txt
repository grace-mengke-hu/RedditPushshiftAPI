Helping others help themselves

I downloaded the stop smoking app on my phone.  Everyday it gives me a mission. One of those missions was to join a support group. It recommended reddit.  This has truly been a great help.  I am on day 18.  My DH is still smoking.  Mornings are hardest for me- because I miss sitting with him.  Hopefully soon he will join us.

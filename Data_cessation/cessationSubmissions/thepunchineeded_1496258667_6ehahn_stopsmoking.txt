Allen Carr's book is a miracle

I was very skeptical as I went into reading this. I thought "no way a book is going to stop what I've been struggling years with." Boy am I glad I read it. I've always known smoking is an addiction but this book really pounds that point home. I'm now looking forward to every craving and will scream at the top of my lungs "DIE MONSTER" even if I look insane. I've never been so excited to be free and it's absolutely stupid how damn easy it is. I guess people were right when they say a positive outlook changes everything. I'm so happy, I'm in tears. We've got this!!!!

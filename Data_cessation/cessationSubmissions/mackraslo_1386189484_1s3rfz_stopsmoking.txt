Made it 160 days, then out of nowhere I caved.

I was doing fantastic, not even thinking about smoking ever, like ever! But then 3 days ago I started to think about having one, no trigger, no reason, then this urge over took all the hard work I had done.  I felt like I wasnt even myself and I couldnt control my actions.  I ended up binge drinking after because I was so down.  I was sober since April, so my sobriety and 160 days of smoke free are down the drain.  I feel so god damn sick now, like worse than the worst flu, So depressed.  Time to start all over again.  What a stupid few days, stupid stupid me.  Keep on fighting the fight, everyone.

Leonard Nimoy wished he quit 30 years ago, so I've decided to quit today.

As soon as I heard about his COPD and later his death and saw the tweets leading up to it, I felt like I had the inspiration to quit. I didn't immediately because I was going to a theatre convention and knew that temptation would be all around (even though it seemed that many people this year had quit, so hopefully theatre won't be as much of a temptation anymore), but I'm starting today. I hope I can make it.

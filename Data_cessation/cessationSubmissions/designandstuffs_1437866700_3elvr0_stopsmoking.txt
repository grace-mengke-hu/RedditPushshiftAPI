sheesh

My last post was "2nd and LAST reset."

I've been a terrible quitter. But this time I am not going back. I am not giving anything up, I am escaping the prison that is smoking. I've purposely avoided this sub because let's face it, there's a big part of me that WANTS to stay chained to this poison. But why!? I have to overcome that lie. Anyway, just needed to get that out there. I will keep coming back here every day, multiple times a day and do whatever I have to do to never smoke again.

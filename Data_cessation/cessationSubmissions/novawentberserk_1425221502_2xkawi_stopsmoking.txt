Unlearning the transitional cigarette?

Hey guys. So I'm going into day six of my second quitting attempt and I realized that my biggest trigger is the transitional cigarette, IOW, the one I smoke before and after beginning and ending an activity or task. So basically...I'm not getting anything done because I'm avoiding that trigger. 

Does anyone have any ideas or experience in making that transition break easier/ enjoyable/ etc?

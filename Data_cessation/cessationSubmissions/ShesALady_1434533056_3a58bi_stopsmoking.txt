I need to understand

My girlfriend is trying to quit and I want to be as supportive as possible. Shes been smoking about a pack a week for several years. We're currently long distance so I can't physically be there, but I want to understand better. What can I say when she tells me how badly she wants a pack? What is it like to be addicted like that? If anyone can offer insight, I want to be able to help her however I can, and that starts with understanding better.

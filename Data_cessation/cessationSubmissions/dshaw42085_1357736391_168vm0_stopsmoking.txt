Today is Day 7. I can't believe I made it this far. 

Day 7 cold turkey. 12 year smoker, smokeless tobacco a few years before that. I smoked about a pack a day for the 8 of the last 9 years, and actually increased to a pack and a half after my first failed quitting attempt. My roommate is out having a smoke right now, same brand I used to smoke and everything. Part of me wants to go join him, but I refuse to make that mistake. I am ready to be done with this shit.

Day 1

It’s been 15 hours. I got the app. I’m going to struggle through the day and hope tomorrow is better. I’ll be going to the gym in a bit which will keep me occupied for a couple hours but then I’ll be left alone with my cravings again. Hopefully tomorrow is better. It’s good seeing all of your success stories.

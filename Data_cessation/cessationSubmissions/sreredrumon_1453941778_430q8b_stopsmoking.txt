I know I should but I don't want to

Not sure if this is the right place, so if it's not please just direct me where to go.

I just had a long conversation with a person who is absolutely repulsed/disgusted by smokers. Being a smoker myself, this hit me pretty hard. I know I should quit, but I feel like I just don't want to. This person made me seriously hate myself for not wanting to quit. I can't help but feel it's just my addiction and not because it helps me cope with anxiety and stress, which is what I've always told myself.  How do I quit when I'm literally sitting here crying thinking about how much I don't want to?

Down to three a day, but always tired now

I was at a pack and a half a day about two months ago and now I ony smoke three a day, but now I'm always extremely tired. I know it's because I don't have copious amounts of nicotine in my blood all the time, I'm more curious how long this will last. I don't like feeling unproductive like this

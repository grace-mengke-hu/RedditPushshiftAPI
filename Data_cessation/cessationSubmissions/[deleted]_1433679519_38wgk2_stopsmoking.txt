Weekends are the worst

I am on day 12 of no cigarettes. I'm taking Wellbutrin and using the patch. I'm doing really well during the week. Minimal cravings. Then the weekend comes....  From Friday at 5 until Sunday when I go to sleep is basically one giant craving. Last weekend I almost went and bought a pack. It is so just the habit of having one while I do yard work or take a break from housework...  It's making me want to pull my hair out!  I'm not going to a BBQ today because I know I'll cave. There will be drinking and smokers and I've never NOT smoked in that situation. When does this get easier?!?

How do you limit the urge?

About 3 weeks ago I decided I want to quit smoking. It has been going well, a few setbacks while being drunk on the weekend but overall it has gone good. Yesterday I bought a pack because I couldn't resist and I smoked one cigarette. Today I was on my way out of the office and wanted to smoke another one before my friend and colleague stopped me.

What do you do to battle these urges to smoke? Is there a trick of some sorts? Do you eat something? Any tips you have are very much welcome!

Day 2.5 no smoking/nicotine. Really struggling

I just need to vent, and I'm sure there are many here who can understand me when I say, I am quite uncomfortable.

I have had some form of nicotine every day for 9 years. Damn...

I am volunteering on a farm and ran out of cigarettes and have no means to get more. This is not the way I wanted to quit. I am furious at everything and cannot concentrate. I have to mentally block the impulse of going for a smoke several times an hour.

I am turning to herbal remedies and distractions to try and take the edge off.

I'm hoping this time tomorrow I will be feeling better. At least from the nicotine withdrawal.

I am considering staying abstinent after this. But a part of me is so angry for having run out of smokes, that I will go buy a pack when I leave here, and smoke the shit out of them.

Though I would like to stay quit for good. How am I doing? what can I expect in the next few days?

Thanks

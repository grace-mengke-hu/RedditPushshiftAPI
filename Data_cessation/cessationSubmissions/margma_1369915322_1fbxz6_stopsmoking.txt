You guys

I could use a bit of encouragement. I don't want to start smoking again, especially since knowing what the past few days have been I don't think I could quickly muster the balls to try quitting again very quickly. 
I can't differntiate between cravings and just being obsessed with cigarettes or quitting. I don't really think I've thought about much else in the past few days, and everytime I start to, its almost like my brain jumps in and reminds me to be bummed or obsessed with quitting. Yesterday it was raining a lot, which seems to be a huge trigger for me. And just when I started to think gee the rain still is nice when I'm not smoking I fell into obsessing over it again.
The thing is, before I quit, all I thought about was how much I needed to quit.

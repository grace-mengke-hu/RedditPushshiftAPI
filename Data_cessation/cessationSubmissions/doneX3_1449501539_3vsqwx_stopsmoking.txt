To move ahead in Week 3 I need to stop drinking too.

I quit smoking once for ten years. I decoupled drinking from smoking. When I quit smoking again I could drink without craving cigarettes, no problem. But I find myself drinking more. My wife says I have substituted one addiction for another, and she is right. I will not smoke, and to move ahead in Week 3 I need to stop drinking too. Neither smoking nor drinking can solve my anxieties. For that I need to be smoke free and alcohol free.

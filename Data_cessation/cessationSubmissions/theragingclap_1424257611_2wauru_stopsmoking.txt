All you lent quitters should maybe easily find one another and buddy up. It certainly helped me having fellow quitters to talk to at the same stage of my quit.

This is a dirty battle and we need to bring out all of the weapons at our disposal. One under rated thing is to buddy up with people at the same stage of your quit, so lent quitters on day one will find it a great help to be able to talk to people going through the same exact thing as them. Your brain is so malleable it forgets the emotions of the early days and so those who have quit longer than you can empathise but not be as understanding as you might need.

Buddy up and use this place to inspire each other to stay quit.

Good luck to everyone changing up their lives by quitting smoking today.

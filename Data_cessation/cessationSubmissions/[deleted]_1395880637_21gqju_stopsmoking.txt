Another milestone: Rolling a cigarette for someone

So my brother is home from university and a couple of his friends are staying round, well it turns out they all smoke. So they were going out for a smoke as we were all in the kitchen and I curiously asked if I could roll my brothers for him since it's been so long.

I was trembling like crazy doing it but I managed a near perfect roll and you know what....I had absolutely no urge to smoke it. I feel like this is another test I have passed as I haven't touched cigarettes/tobacco/smokeables since I quit. Just wanted to share my small little victory today with you guys.

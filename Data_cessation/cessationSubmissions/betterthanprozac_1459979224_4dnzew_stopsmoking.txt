Relapse

Hey guys. First time posting in this subreddit. I've been smoking for about 2 or 3 years now, somedays burning through a pack a day on bad days, but usually sticking to a pack a week. Over the past few months, I picked up vaping, supplemented with cigarettes. This drastically decreased the amount I was smoking.

Back in January, my husband's grandmother passed away from cancer caused by smoking and I quit for his sake. He begged me not to smoke anymore and I agreed. Since then we've been avid vapers. It's been a few months since I've quit smoking, but since getting off my meds, I've been particularly irritable, angry, and my emotions are wild. I've been craving cigarettes for weeks now, as vaping just isn't cutting it for me anymore.

Today was the day I finally caved because everything is going to shit for me. Walked to the store down the road and bought a pack and immediately lit one up when I got out the door. Although the cigarette felt great, I feel fucking awful. I haven't said anything to my husband since coming back home, but I'm pretty sure he knows and is very upset. I've been home for 20 minutes and he still hasn't come in the room yet.

I fucked up.

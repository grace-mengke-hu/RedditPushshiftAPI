Quitting and Depression, Anyone?

I'm not one to go bringing things up like this, fearing being seen as narcissistic. 
But I wanted to see if anyone else here has tried to quit while dealing with depression? 

I need a crutch of some sort while I go through this, and use smoking to curb my reliance on drinking, lesser of two evils and all that.

I just wanted to see if anyone else had any experiences similar to this they think might help me in any way to fix what I see as the easiest issue here, which is my smoking.

Also, maybe relevant, is that for me, the drinking and smoking don't go hand-in-hand, unlike most I'm pretty safe from social smoking, it's much more of a solitary thing for me.

Thanks, and good luck to you all in your own journeys.

Wellbutrin and sobriety is really helping so far

I have been really mentally fragile, so after each recent attempt at a cold turkey quit I ended up smoking more. The last week I smoked, I was at 30 a day, chain smoking. Started Wellbutrin three days before my quit date (Thursday) and cravings have been really minimal. I also got all weed and alcohol out of the house too (binge behavior was becoming a problem all around) and it's been helpful to realize that I might just be prone to abusing substances, and I can include tobacco in that. I will not smoke, drink, or use with you today!

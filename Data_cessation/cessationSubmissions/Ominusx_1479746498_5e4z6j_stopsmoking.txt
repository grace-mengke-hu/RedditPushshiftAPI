Cutting down, need tips

Hi guys, I don't smoke a great deal, one after work and one before bed. While I don't even think about cigarettes during the day I'd love to give up and the urge is seriously real when I get in as it allows me to relax and unwind. 

I'm finding it difficult to go without because without my after work smoke I am always a bit anxious and find it hard to sleep if I don't have one before bed. 

Either way, I realise this might seem trivial to some heavier smokers but I want to stop and I'm actually finding it hard to do so, especially because 2/3 doesn't seem like a great deal and I genuinely feel a little relieved when I do have my afterwork smoke.

Any tips? 

I had a vaporiser that I have since misplaced at my home from home but I found it harsh on my throat if I get a juice which has any meaningful amounts of nicotine.

Many thanks guys

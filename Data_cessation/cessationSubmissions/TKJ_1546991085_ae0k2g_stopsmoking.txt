After a bad cold, couldn't smoke and decided to quit.

That was five days ago. On Friday, I was coughing so so much, but was desperate for a cigarette. I tried twice that morning, but couldn't get past a couple of drags each time without a burning coughing fit ensuing. 

My brain kicked over, and immediately upon my next craving, it said, "sorry pal, you light up and I'm gonna make it hurt." So, I figure I'm done.

But here's where it gets weird. Over the next few days of having this cold, I didn't really feel like I wanted to smoke. Now, almost a week later, I'm feeling like I'd be fine, and I've got three packs sitting in my drawer beside me, but I've got no craving at all. (I'm concerned it may 'hit' at some inopportune time, but I'm pretty confident I'll be able to stay strong.)

My wife smokes, and I can't stop her at the moment, and I've been there when she smokes. Still nothing.

I honestly don't know what to expect. Hopefully once this cold goes away and I can taste things again, all will be well!

Good luck to everyone in a similar boat!

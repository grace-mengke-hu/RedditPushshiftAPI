Allan Carr strikes again!

Last week one of my clients stopped in to pick something up and told us that he trying to quit smoking. Of course I had to brag that I haven't smoked in nearly SIX MONTHS!! I told him that I was able to quit cold turkey, and it was all because of a silly book. And being the crazy, pushy person that I am, I decided to order the book from amazon for him. 

He called me today to thank me, and say that he thinks I gave him the best gift of his entire life. How sweet is that?

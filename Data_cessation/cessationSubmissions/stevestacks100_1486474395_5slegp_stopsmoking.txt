3 WEEKS IN AND LOVING IT.

I stopped smoking 3 weeks ago today and I'm loving it. My son is 7 months old as of next week and when I come home from work for a cigarette smelling free cuddle, I love it even more!! Everything feels different in a good way! I look at somebody smoking and instantly am thankful I made the decision to be a non smoker. Admittedly I've had a couple of tough moments (arguments or drink) but when you resist that urge and just wait it out you feel so good about it! Just want to say good luck everyone it definitely gets easier the more you resist!!! KEEP IT UP!!!

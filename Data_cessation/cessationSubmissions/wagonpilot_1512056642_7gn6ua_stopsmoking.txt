I really need to stop while I still can

I smoked in grade 9 every day, then I cut back to 1 cigarette before bed every night. As I grew older, 1 became 2 and I started to smoke from time to time while drinking.

I am in recovery now (3.5 months), but a week ago I started up again. A lot of people smoke at AA meetings and I don't know what happened. But now I am in the pattern of throwing out my pack every morning, and then by mid day, buying another one.

I hate the way they make me feel - totally unproductive. I have to go lie down after having one. Then all I want to do is smoke more and more.

I need to cut them out while it's still early.

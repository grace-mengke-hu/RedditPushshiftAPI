One year delight

Woo-hoo, it's a year!

Finally, for the last month I finally feel that I don't care for the smoking at
all â€” maybe summer and starting regular jogging has got to do something
with it.

Corollary, the _previous_ eleven months weren't all fun and games, and all that
time I had the Urges I had to work against somewhat regularly. So... sorry, you might have a rought road ahead, too. Reading (and sometimes
responding to) posts here, and the day counter were actually a big help.

I'd like to use my five minutes of yearly fame to encourage you to sit and
reconsider the other aspects of your life you might want to improve. Now that
you're not smoking, there might be less friction on cutting back alcohol,
starting some gentle sports, maybe even trying to go to bed and
waking up in approximately the same time every day: you might get close to
being superheroes when you hit that year mark!

Cheers!

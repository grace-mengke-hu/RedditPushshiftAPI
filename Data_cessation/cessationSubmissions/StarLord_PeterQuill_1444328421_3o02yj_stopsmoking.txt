Officially on day 5 without a cigarette.

My wife and I decided to stop smoking after we calculated that we were spending in excess of $3000 a year on cigarettes. I haven't been more than a day without a cigarette in close to 10 years. I felt absolutely awful for the first 2 days, but now it's finally starting to lessen up. 

The nicotine patches I'm wearing to help with the cravings are odd. Did anyone else have crazy-lucid and vivid dreams while using nicotine patches. The past few days have been nuts. 

Oh, and I have just realized that I always smelled like shit when I was a smoker. I can smell it on people now, and it's super embarrassing.

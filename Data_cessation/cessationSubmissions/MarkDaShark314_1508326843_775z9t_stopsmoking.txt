I started smoking cigarettes freshman year of high school, (14 years old). I'm 24 now and slowly dying.

I spiraled into careless reckless abuse. I've smoked most brands, flavors, hookah, cigars, even buds off the ground.

A nurse told me my CO2 levels are beyond their measuring. Needless to say I've once again made the commitment to cecession.

It's gonna stick this time I feel it.
The most success I've had is with vaping, but it's a task to maintain. 

NRT is useless, so my only option is cold turkey. 
Wish me luck.

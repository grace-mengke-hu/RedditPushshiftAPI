Why do cigarettes smell so good?

I haven't smoked in 4 weeks and everytime I walk by someone smoking it smells great. It smells BETTER than when I was smoking. Everyone on here claims that cigarette smoke smells terrible when you quit but it smells better to me. The cravings weren't bad for me and quitting wasn't hard but I did avoid smokers. When I go back around smokers I'm thinking the smell will tempt me to smoke. Has it not been long enough for cigarette smoke to bother me? When did the smell start bothering you guys?

Smoking tobacco out of a water pipe

Hey so I know most people on this sub are trying to quit smoking cigarettes but it’s pretty common where I’m from to smoke tobacco and weed out of a bong and I’ve been trying to quit for almost a year now. I’ve heard them called mokes, moles, chops, etc. but it’s basically just an intense head rush when you take it and then just makes you feel tired and spaced out all day. It’s to the point where it’s affecting my school and social life and I still wake up every morning and the first thing I️ do is take one. I️ never really get the craving for cigarettes because the head rush just feels better out of a bong, but I️ know it’s just as bad if not worse. I don’t know if anyone’s had an experience like this with weed and tobacco but if you have and found a way to quit any advice or tips would be hugely appreciated.

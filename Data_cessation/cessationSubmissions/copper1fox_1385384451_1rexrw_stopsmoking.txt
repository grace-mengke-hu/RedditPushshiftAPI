Is it so bad???

Well here's the story.... I'm currently on my day 7 full days smoke free, i've managed to escape the cravings when I have a few drinks and I have managed to get passed the boredom eating problem. 

My issue is that before I gave up smoking I was actively going to the gym but whilst I am still taking the Champix (Chantix in the USA) I am having really disturbed sleep and by the time I finish work I don't seem to have the energy to go.

So my question is... Is it so bad for me to not go to the gym whilst I finish my course of tablets and only go if I have the energy after work?

Here we go (for the 6th time)

I have made a few posts on here in the last two years, and the people on here have always been so kind and supportive. Well, I need help again. I need a reminder as to why I wanna quit. the chest pains, the inability to walk up a flight of stairs, the coughing, the smell, the acid reflux. all of it. I have a very stressful life and smoking is my friend. smoking is my escape, my excuse. but it's time for better choices. of anyone has any kind words, I could really use some.

thank you.

I think I just bought my last smokes

I started reading Allen Carr about a week ago; kept the book in my "smoking room" and read when I smoked, as per Allen's instuctions. 

I'm now on the last few chapters and am acutely aware of each cigarette I smoke, loathing it and looking forward to being free.

So, typical day, running about; running low on smokes and some quick math tells me a) I won't finish the book before I run out of smokes and b) I gotta have some to ceremoniously destroy on Liberation Day, right?

Standing in line and it hits me: these are, if all goes according to plan, the last smokes I'll ever buy. I started to sweat a little and a feeling of elation came over me, and I started to grin, for despite actually buying smokes I felt like I had, for the first time, really gripped the reigns of this beast we call cigarette/nicotine addiction.

A scene ran through my mind of making a little speech at the counter to the hapless clerk: "You, sir, should buy a lottery ticket because statistically, you just won a lottery of sorts - I've been smoking for twenty years and have bought smokes from countless clerks at thousands of stores just like this - and out of all those people, you're the one selling me my last smoke!"

I didn't say any of that shit, of course. Thought about buying a lottery ticket though.

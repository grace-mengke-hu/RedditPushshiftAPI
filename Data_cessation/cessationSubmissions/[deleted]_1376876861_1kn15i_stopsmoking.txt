Day 38. Chest and lung discomfort. Normal?

23M. This is the longest I've been without smoking cigarettes, many thanks to this sub. I'm happy to say that I'm currently on day 38. However, I've had this discomfort in my chest, like my throat and lungs are clogged or something, for the past few days. I'm wondering if this is normal around this time. The physical symptoms now feel much worse than the first few weeks.

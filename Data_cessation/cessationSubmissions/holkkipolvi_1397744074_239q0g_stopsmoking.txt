I am the 64 years old male who smoked over 50 years

I am 64 years old Finnish male who started smoking in 1958. Now I have been smoke free one month. When I joined this subreddit and shared my story the second day after I quitted I received really a lots of feedback from all you guys. Then I could'nt even imagine that I could make a whole month. Anyway now it is true and I am extremely happy. I haven't been active in writing here but I have visited this subreddit several times every day. Up voting people's comments and tried to support ohther stoppers. To me you all have been really a great support. I still wear nicotine patches but after a month I should have been done with those things too. I am really thankfull to all of you because you have helped me a lot in standing by my decison and not relapsed back in smoking. I have told many of my friends that this subreddit has been a great help and support to me. Sadly most of my friends (people over 60) have no idea what reddit is so it hasn't been  much help for them. Anyway I want thank you all for your support. Of course I have had huge cravings every now and then but I have no intention to give after. I have also earned an extra bonus that I did'nt even dream of. When my daughters are visiting me they give me big hugs because it is much nicer to hug a daddy who does'nt smell strongly tobacco. :) I am really happy for that. I have three children and they all very proud of me. So in that point of wiev I can' afford a relapse. God bless you all and more smoke free days to everybody <3

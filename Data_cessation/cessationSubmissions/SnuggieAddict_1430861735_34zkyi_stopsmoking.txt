2 whole years!

Today I'm celebrating two years free from nicotine. I used to be very active in this subreddit in my first months, back when I though I could never make it. So, I came for a short visit to say: thank you. You guys have been supportive, understanding and kind. Thank you for helping me with this journey. See you next year :)

hold yourself accountable.

cigarettes aren't a reward.

you either want to get healthy or you don't.

your brain is going to lie to you at some point soon and tell you you want one. throw those cravings away and throw your last cigarettes away.

if you take a vow to not smoke and hold yourself accountable, maybe it'll help. make a real vow to quit smoking. the kind people hardly ever make nowadays.

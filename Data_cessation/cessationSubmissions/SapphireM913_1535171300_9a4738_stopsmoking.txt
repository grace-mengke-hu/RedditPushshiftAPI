I think I survived 3 weeks

I'm on Day 24. Day 20-23 was rough. Today was a lot better. No cravings (patches and lozenges but would still get them, they were just manageable), and I'm starting to forget about "how do I work that thing in my day around a smoke break". I still miss the one before bed though. It's bedtime now, and I do miss that part of the routine. And the smell. I know everyone says I'll find it gross but I never did. My parents friends that smoked, I used to love hugging them as a kid. I'd hope we got seated close to the smoking section of a restaurant as a kid. My neighbors smoke (I live in an apartment) and today was nice enough to not have the air on, and have the windows open. I could smell it. It was alluring. I was sad to think about the fact that that's all the more I'll ever get. 

Not going to smoke. I know I can't. I still miss parts though. A lot.

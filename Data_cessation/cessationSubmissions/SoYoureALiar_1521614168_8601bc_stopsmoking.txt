Seeking advice - potential boyfriend just revealed to me that he smokes

I've been seeing this guy I met online. We have so much in common and we talk about everything. He's really just a wonderful person and I care about him. However, he just revealed to me that he can't keep it a secret any longer -- he smokes. He says he's incredibly embarrassed about it and hates that he does it. I sense a lot of shame attached to it.

My family has a long history of lung cancer; my grandmother died of second-hand smoke inhalation. I'm having trouble comprehending this, but I still care about him and this doesn't change how I feel about him. It does make me sad, though.

I've told him about my family's history and he's promised not to smoke around me; he's also asked me for motivation to help him quit, as he doesn't see smoking in his future.

I have a few questions, if you don't mind.

1. If I'm not around him when he's physically smoking, is my health in danger? (like if I smell it on his clothes or his breath at all?) I don't believe he smokes in his house, only outside.

2. Since he's told me how much he hates smoking and would like my motivation, how can I support him in achieving this?

Thank you for hearing me out.

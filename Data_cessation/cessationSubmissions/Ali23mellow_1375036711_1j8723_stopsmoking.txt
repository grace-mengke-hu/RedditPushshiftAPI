Day 2 (12 years of smoking/23 years old)

Doing good on no smoking. Not really craving them :) They smell gross to me now. Am craving coffee and beer like crazy though lol better than picking up a cigarette though! Got lots of energy yet lack the motivation to do anything. Can already breath a little easier and not getting winded as easy lol Feeling great about this decision so far.

26 Months

 Smokeless for 26 months after 33 years of a 2-3 pack a day habit.

 For those who recently quit or are planning on quitting, stay strong and don't use anything as an excuse to smoke a single cigarette.

 Everyone has stress, do something besides smoking to relieve it. Try using stress as an excuse NOT to smoke.

 Don't "treat" or "reward" yourself to a smoke for being a month smoke-free. 

 Good luck to all.

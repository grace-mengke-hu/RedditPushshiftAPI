I am going to stop smoking today! Why? Story inside!

Hey, so here is the story:

My parents always wanted me to go to a school i didnt want to, so i was not really good and did a lot of stupid things like smoking pot and dropping out of school in the last two years - i moved later to a friends appartment and we did nothing just smoking - everyday - was kinda funny. Till i realized that i was already 25, not 16 anymore - and had still nothing (education). So i met this beautiful woman (my girlfriend today, we are together since 4 years now), and started to study it-security with some exams to allow me this - since i had no school finished,.. i finished yesterday. Got my bachelors degree with 28 and i think i closed some open wounds with it. 

I dont need to smoke anymore.

Nothing to fear, nothing to hide for,..

I want to run. 
I want to Inline Skate.
I want to swim.

--- With getting air.

Greeting and thanks!

Hit three years yesterday!

Hey friends.

I woke up yesterday feeling like there was something I should be doing, the date felt kind of important but I couldn't work out why. It dawned on me eventually that it was my 3 year anniversary! Shit yeah! It feel great, but also kind of meh because I never really think about it any more. I'd say the last six months have been some of the worst of my life, and I never once thought having one in that time. It's awesome.

One of my favourite regular customers came into work the other day. She used to smoke a lot but quit a while ago (I think I might have played a part in that, we had a good chat about how I managed it and she quit very soon after). She had tears in her eyes and asked for a packet of her usuals, I felt like shit selling them to her - she'd recently made it 3 months. 

When I got home I was thinking, you know, maybe if I just offered to listen to her for 5 minutes and if she still wanted them after that's fine, or said something maybe she wouldn't have ruined it. Well, she came back in tonight! She told me what had happened (a failed IVF treatment with a huge cost upward of 20k). She also said she had a couple of tiny puffs before she realised they tasted like shit and she put it out. I was stoked for her! What a win!

Anyway, thanks for all the support in the early stages. Keep going everyone, you got this!

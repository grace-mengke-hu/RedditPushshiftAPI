Everyone post here so we can show the struggling quitters or lurkers what a support system they have!

Also, upvote for visibility for those that subscribe but don't visit the subreddit. I get no karma for this since it's a self post!

Edit #3: 3 upvotes, 2 comments. Someone isn't playing by the rules!

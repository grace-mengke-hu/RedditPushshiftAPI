I need a reminder of whats at stake

Im over 5 weeks into my cold turkey quit, its going well so far, ive been fighting off cravings left right and centre.

Recently the cravings have been getting stronger, not weaker, with my main source of doubt stemming from the thought of a long hot summer sitting around with my friends in the sun without cigarettes. 

I am 20 and a niggling devil thought in my head makes me sometimes feel (wrongly) that I shouldnt quit yet, as noone else my age even considers it. 

Can you guys help pull me through this lull? Ive been comfort eating like fuck recently but refuse to cave to devil smokes! Thanks in advance

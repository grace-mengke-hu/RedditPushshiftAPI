Still can't concentrate after 2 weeks

When did your concentration come back after quitting? I've been told the concentration thing should only be for a week. This is pretty important to me, I have a MASSIVE school work load, and I cant focus on it for more than ten minutes , let alone get myself to actually start doing my math, half the time I just want to sit on quitting smoking support groups.

14 days and a couple questions.

I have been experiencing a burnt like smell for about 5 days now. I don't know much about the healing process but the smells are extremely unpleasant. The smell also is not constant but whenever I can smell something else that smell is overpowered by the burnt smell. An example is when I brush my teeth I will smell a tiny hint of mint but that is overpowered by the burning smell. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Is this normal?

Trying again, on day 3

disregard my flair i can't figure out how to change it. I'm almost through day 3, been drinking lots of water. My first two days I kinda cheated, got high instead of smoking cigs. In a weak moment just now, I had a butt that was sitting in my ash tray, but it was maybe two puffs. I'm not counting that, it was just enough to keep me going.

EDIT: Just a question, can cannabis help you quit?

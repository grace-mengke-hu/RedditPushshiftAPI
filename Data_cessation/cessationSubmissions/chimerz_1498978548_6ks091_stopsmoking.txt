I said NO!

About 5 weeks in now without a smoke. On the weekend I got drunk with a bunch of friends who smoke ( this is my most vulnerable time to slip up ) long story short. I breezed through the night cigarette free and without consciously avoiding them. 

Another milestone in this life long journey!

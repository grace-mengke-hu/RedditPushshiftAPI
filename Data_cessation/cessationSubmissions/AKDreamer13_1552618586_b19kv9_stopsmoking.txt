Never been so scared to quit in my life

First time post. I am stopping cigarettes on March 16. I made a decision to 10 days ago, and confirmed it last week when my mom told me she has lung cancer. The only thing is, smoking has been in my life for the past 15 years (29 f). Pripr to that it was my parents in the house in the 90's.  Theres not one day I went without it. Wisdom teeth, mono, tonsillectomy (30 min after surgery)... you name it. Believe me, I am not proud of this and my boyfriend absolutely hates that I smoke.   

I have tried quitting numerous times but apparently am allergic to everything on the market nicotine replacement wise. So I've decided that I am going cold turkey.

I'm so scared, being tomorrow my last day, because I am also weaning off anti depressants at the same time and alot of things are very stressful right now. I keep making excuses and have to stop. I've let myself down. I even have a brand new car and I started smoking heavily in it.   I hope I quit smoking. I've never kept a promise with myself as there is a lack of love and confidence in myself. 

Can anyone recommend anything? Open to tips and tricks for cold turkey, experiences and encouragement!  Looking for all the support I can, so I've also turned to you all here on Reddit.   

Thank you so much in advance!

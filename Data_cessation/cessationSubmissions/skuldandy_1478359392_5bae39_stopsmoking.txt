I keep dreaming about smoking...

Hey there everyone.

I've lurked around here for a few months (I stopped smoking around 3 months ago) but this is my first time posting.

I keep having dreams in which I smoke. Not everyday, more like once a week or something. In these dreams I am usually doing something else and then suddenly I'm doing it while also smoking. There's no conscious moment of deciding to smoke, I am just suddenly smoking and it feels completely normal.

Only after a while do I realize "WAIT SHIT I QUIT SMOKING WHY AM I SMOKING?!" and I throw the cigarrette away. Then I start to feel super guilty thinking about all that hard work quitting wasted away in a moment... And after a while I wake up and feel a huge wave of relief that it was just a dream. But it feels so real at the time. And even after waking up I remember that moment of smoking as if it'd been real.

So... I just wanted to share this with you. And ask you if it has happened to you too? Dreaming about smoking? Is this normal?

As a goodbye,
good luck to all current and future non-smokers here!

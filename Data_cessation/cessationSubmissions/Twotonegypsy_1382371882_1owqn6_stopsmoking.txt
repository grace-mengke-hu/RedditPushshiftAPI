I will not succumb! (Hardest days yet)

215 days and right now is the toughest time.  There is a strong possibility that I have lost my job.  I say strong as in "Sent home for being insubordinate."  and have yet to receive a call from HR to know whats going to happen with me.  Wanna hear the crazy part of it, I get married in 12 days.  

It's not that I want a cig, it;s that I want that shitty feeling back, that one thing that I could fall back on.  I have to have a brave face to keep the fiance not freaking that fuck out (of course she knows the whole situation) but man do I want to break down, cry and feel shitty.  But this is no time for that.  Self motivation got me to 215 days smoke free and I'll be damned if something as insignificant as losing my job will throw me back into the depths of hell.  

Edit:  Got fired, but haven't smoked.  Staying positive.

Also, I haven't turned to the whisky either.  Let's keep that for celebrations.

Starting today. Terrified, but here's my personal Why:

**Why I don't want to smoke anymore:**

* I want to be fit, and not just for vanity's sake. I want to do the gym, then the Color Run, then the Warrior Challenge. The first step to earning my Viking hat is to quit smoking!
* I want to actually smell like the perfumes that I spend so much money on.
* I want to pay off my student loans AND save money for vacations. 
* I want to watch a movie in its entirety without pausing to smoke or fighting through a craving and then rushing out of the theater the moment I can. 
* I want to prove I can do it. I've been smoking for 11 years and "quitting" for 9. 

**My Weak Points that need to be addressed:**

* Talking about cigarettes reminds me that I want one. There is a difference between supportive words like "you don't need that!" and "I quit: so can you!" and reminder words like "did you smoke today?" 
* Driving. I need to figure out something else to do while driving that isn't just driving, but that is safe to do while driving and is stimulating enough. 
* Being bored. Do something that stimulates you well. You wouldn't stop playing Uno and Fallout NV in order to smoke. Keep doing those things. 

**Rewards:**

* More monies! Try to save those cigarette funds and reward yourself with a few mini-vacations at milestone points.
* Maybe I can finally buy a Wii-U!!
* Better hiking experiences
* Better breathing, maybe even built back up to singer's levels. 
* 1-up extra life!
* Satisfaction of not being a failure for a decade. Bitch, what?

Sorry if this isn't interesting for everyone, but I really want to get this out there for myself. Maybe it will help the lurkers and the strugglers (like me) to really get motivated. 

I also bought my husband the patch today. Let's see how this goes. Reddit, cross your fingers in hope that I don't get a divorce! JKJK. ðŸ˜‚

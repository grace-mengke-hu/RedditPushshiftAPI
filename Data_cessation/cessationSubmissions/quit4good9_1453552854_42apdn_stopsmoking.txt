Day 1

Today is the day I became a non-smoker, I'm 24 and have smoked for the past 6 years, heavily in the last 4. I want my energy back, I want my money back, I want my health back and I want my life back. 

I'm posting here as part of my strategy to remain a non smoker for life. Please give any suggestions, I'm committed to make this work.

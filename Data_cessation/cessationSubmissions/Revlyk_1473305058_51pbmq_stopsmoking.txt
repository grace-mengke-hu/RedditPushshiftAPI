Day 23... Or is it 24?

As I mentioned in a previous post a week or so ago, I quit smoking. I used gum and lozenges the first week however after eating them like skittles, I opted for the patches and gum and lozenges when I felt the craving to be to much.

I'm now finishing off the last of my Step 1 patches after 20ish days having accidentally forgetting to use them multiple times. Once even two days in a row. Cravings were at a level where I had a slightly case of anxiety, but nothing a walk around the block didn't fix. Honestly this is the second longest I've ever been a non smoker (the first being from when I was born, to age 21) and it feels great.

If you considering trying them, I would recommend all 3 of the aids. The patches have caused me itching, and have left red marks on my skin when wearing and for a while after being removed however there is no discomfort (not counting the itch). I have noticed that my sleep tends to be more spotty with the patches as I tend to wake up 2-4 times a night while wearing them but I rarely wake up because of a craving. Nightmares have occurred, but once again for me it is within a manageable range.
The Gum/Lozenges actually make me nauseous, and I do get the hiccups fairly often because of them.

But honestly, I regret none of it. I cough less, I can actually smell the oil/dirt/sweat that gets on my nose by the end of the day (man that's really gross by the way) and my wife has even remarked a few times that I smell a lot better.

I could probably go on, but honestly if you haven't started now I'd really recommend heading to walmart and buying the equate versions of the patches, gum, and lozenges and throwing the rest of your cigarettes away! Don't wait until your last cigarette to quit, make your last cigarette your last!

Side note: I know my flair is wrong, I forgot to update my flair when i quit and just put in the date that i requested.

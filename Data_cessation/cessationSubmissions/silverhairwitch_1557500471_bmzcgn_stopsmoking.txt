Just starting the steps. Chantix causing nausea

I’ve been smoking for 9 years trying to quit off and on. I finally called my doctor and she prescribed chantix. However I’m only on the third day and the nausea is beyond bearable to the point where I almost threw up in the parking lot at work. I have followed all directions on the packaging and it’s still causing me problems. Anything I could do? It’s starting to deter me. But I want to quit. Is it worth calling the doctor to see if I can get some anti nausea meds?

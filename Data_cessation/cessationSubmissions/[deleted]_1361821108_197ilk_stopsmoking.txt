Intense beliefe I am done smoking

I started smoking around the summer of July/2007 when I was 22. I am now 28 and have been smoking for just under 6 years. 

First thing...wow. I did not know it has been such a long time. I mean I know it has, but reflecting to the moment i started till now, is just crazy for me because i still feel like a "new" smoker, even though a few more years and it would have been a decade.

During these 6 years i have been able to half heartedly stop smoking twice. Once for 12 solid days, an another foe about 5 which was a few years ago. Since then i have not been able to make it at least 24 hours of not smoking, there has never been a day where i have gone a full day without smoking for about 2 years now.

I don't know why or how but i really just made my mind up yesterday and decided to stop, cold turkey.

 I have been a pack a day kind of guy since the moment i picked them up and smoke aobut 2 packs on the weekends.

It has been 36 straight hours since my last cig, and there isnt a bone in my body that craves them any more. I know this wont last, and i know i need to educate myself to keep it going, but it is a strange feeling, i just easily as anything ive ever done, flat out dont want to smoke, and am not craving them. Well, lets hope i stay like this forever! Even with this said, i do plan on educating myself and realizing i will be an addict my entire life and i need to learn how to cope properly to stay off properly.. I know it has been barely a day, and i never get like this over anytihng, but im pretty confident im done an dim happy about it.

2017 showstoppers.

Who all stopped smoking this year?. 
Please check in the comment and keep your resolve strong.

I also love how this sub is named stopsmoking rather than quitsmoking as it alignes with Carr's philosophy of how we are not giving up anything but stopping a drug addiction for good.

Cheers and have a smoke free life ahead mates! :)

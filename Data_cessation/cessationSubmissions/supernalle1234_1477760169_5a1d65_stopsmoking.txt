one month in. sad & depressed.

Topic says it all.
I'm one month in without nicotine. I'm sad and depressed. Nothing is fun.

Reason I quit smoking/chewing in the first place was to better my mental health. Had a lot of anxiety while still using nicotine. That has gotten better actually. But jeeebus.. the depressed state has not been fun these last days.

Anyone else with the blues at a month or so in to the quit?

Today is the day.

I am about to finish Allen Carr's book this morning and have my last smoke. I am ready. Tired of being kept on this ball and chain of a very expensive habit. Tired of coughing, wheezing, smelling of smoke, spending about $100 a week... time to reclaim my heath, my money and myself. I say that because, I am stronger than the cigarettes. I can break this hold they have over me.

I have nicotine gum from another attempt at quitting several months ago but I am going to try this go at cold turkey. I haven't ever made it past a day or two with out using the gum before but I know if I can just hold on those first 3 days that the nicotine will be out of my system. I will buy some regular gum perhaps and something to keep my mouth busy that won't pack a ton on my hips.

I am ready. I can do this. Thank you all for being here and being so supportive. A little later today, when I have finished the book I will begin my badge counter. Or tomorrow? I am not sure if I should consider my quit date today or tomorrow.

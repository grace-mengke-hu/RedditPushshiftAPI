Not even finished with day two and I've been an emotional wreck for the past two hours.

This.  Sucks.  

Work ends on a bad note.  Home isn't that great right now.  I know if I smoke, I'll be okay.  I also know that's bullshit, and I need to knuckle down and just not do it.  I can't even think about leaving to buy any for at least 45 minutes.  

I'm kind of amazed at the gamut of emotions I'm feeling right now.  I could totally cry, like, hardcore ugly cry right now.  I also feel like I'm four seconds away from being majorly pissed off about anything.  Doesn't matter what.  I'm sad for no apparent fucking reason other than I want a pity party for myself, and...yeah.

Don't mind me.  None of my friends want to text me back, so I'm pseudo-venting until my craving passes.

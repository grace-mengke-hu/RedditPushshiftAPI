My GF smoked her last cigarette 2 weeks ago. She is having very bad times but she will do it!

She switched to vape but it doesn't help too much unfortunately.  

She is having very bad times: depression, chills, panic attacks, anxiety, etc. 
Her withdrawal reminds my hellish kratom withdrawal although she smoked 5 cigarettes per day max.
She struggles so hard.

I proud of her.

I love her.

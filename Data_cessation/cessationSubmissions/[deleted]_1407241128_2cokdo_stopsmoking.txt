i've been telling myself i'll quit for the last eleven months. i have to run a marathon at the end of september. help!

smoker for two years (i'm 23). i started smoking whilst suffering from a running-related injury after running the london marathon in 2012. since i moved to a new city last september, i've been deciding to quit almost every day - and it just hasn't worked. i've had the odd week off now and again and almost two months smoke-free in january-february this year, but i keep coming back to it. even when i tell my flatmates or friends that i'm quitting and not to let me smoke i find it super easy to make excuses. i really love the act of smoking. i'm also really good at lying to myself: to the extent that i've been making excuse after excuse to myself to continue smoking ever since signing up (in april) for another marathon as something to push me to quit. it hasn't worked yet. the marathon is coming up in less than 8 weeks now and i'm terrified of not being able to do it because i simply cannot figure out how not to smoke.

i have pretty big triggers around: we smoke a lot of weed at home (which i don't intend to quit); we smoke in my shared flat so papers/tobacco are always lying around; i spend loads of time outside and love a cigarette at the end of a long bike ride or hike, round a campfire or by my tent; i've been going to a lot of music festivals this summer...

but i want to continue doing my hobbies and having my friends, just without smoking! help :(

i chucked out a pack of tobacco about 6pm last night and it's now about 1pm, i need to go and run fifteen miles this afternoon and then i NEED to stay cigarette-free because i do, really, want to quit - and the marathon is getting ever closer.

just found this subreddit and thought i'd see what advice/encouragement you guys have...

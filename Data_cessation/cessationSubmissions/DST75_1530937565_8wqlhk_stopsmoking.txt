Weight gain after quitting?

I’ve been watching what I eat since I quit smoking because I was afraid of gaining weight and despite my best efforts, I’m getting fat. It’s only been 20 days but I definitely look and feel fatter, clothes are tighter and my belly is huge.  Does quitting mess with your metabolism or what am I doing wrong here?  Any advice from those that have gone through this?

How to eliminate the "reward" smoke?

I want to quit smoking. I smoked more or less a pack a day and I've been smoking for approximately 6 years. Quitting has seriously been on the back of my mind for the past two-three months or so. 

Three weeks ago I did not smoke for 5 days and a half (damn I was counting hours). I am now back at 5ish cigs a day, only in the evening, but I really want to give it another shot. During these 5 days, one of the biggest problem I faced was that as a smoker, whenever I finished something that took me some time and investment I would light up one. Some sort of a reward for having completed some task. 

During my smoke-free break, I felt something was missing whenever I would finish something. It was kind of a "alright, now what?" feeling and that was quite frustrating. Actually, at the moment, I am still stuck in the same pattern, I allow myself to smoke only in the evening thinking "I did not smoke during the day, but now I can".

Now, I don't do stuff for the smoke after (otherwise my boss would be quite pissed), but this association "do stuff - have a smoke" has more or less been hard-wired in my brain. I'm sure I'm not the only one, so how do you cope with this feeling of "incompleteness". Do you replace it with something else, but what ? Coffee, candies, a glass of fine whiskey? 

Thanks for reading me and my silly problems, any advices will be much appreciated.

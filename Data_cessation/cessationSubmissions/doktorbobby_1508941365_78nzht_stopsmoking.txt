A 1000 hours later

I still miss smoking several times every day. 

But I can now enjoy coffee again - which was really hard without the accompanying cigarette in the beginning.

My resting heart rate dropped by 10bpm.

I can go out and have a few drinks without the fear or relapsing.

I am not self-conscious about the smell when kissing my girlfriend.

Gained a few pounds but saved a few euros. 

Worth it, I guess.

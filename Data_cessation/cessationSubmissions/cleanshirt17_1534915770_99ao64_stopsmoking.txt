Varenicline is a god send

I used varenicline to quit smoking some time last year, and had my last cigarette only 11 days after starting the treatment. At the end of last year I was drinking a lot and unfortunately relapsed, but varenicline did it again! Currently just over a week without a cigarette and I have no desire to smoke at all. This time I've also quit drinking in order to stay off the cigs, I can't recommend this drug enough or speak highly enough of it

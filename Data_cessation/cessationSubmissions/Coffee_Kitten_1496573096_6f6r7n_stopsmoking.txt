I've read both Carr and whyquit.com books. Any other resources you might recommend?

Hi all,
I've read Carr about 3 times now and the whyquit.com books about 2 times. What I've realised is that a fresh look on cigarettes in the form of a book really helps me motivate myself and has helped me stay quit for months in the past.
I'm really hoping that there is a third option, a third resource I somehow have not yet heard about - can anyone recommend any other quitting books, blogs or resources?

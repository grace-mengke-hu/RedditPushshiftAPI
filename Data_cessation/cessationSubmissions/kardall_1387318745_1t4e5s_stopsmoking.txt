45 Days in - Christmas Vacation Next Week (9+ hrs of Driving)

So I am travelling to Saskatchewan for Christmas to visit the parents this year. They are over 9 hour drive away, and I could have flown out, but I feel that I should test myself.

For anyone who has followed my previous posts, you will know that Driving is one of my biggest triggers. I have been driving on average 3-4 hours every day for the last 45 days and I've gotten through it.

My normal habit from where I live is to go from here to Medicine Hat with no break. Then I drive from Medicine Hat to Swift Current with 4 Red Bulls and as many cigarettes as it took me to get through the dull and boring road trip. Then Swift Current to Just outside Regina. Filling up every stop.

But now, no smoking, I don't think I can make that part of the road without some kind of energy drink. It's so boring. But we'll see. Good luck to everyone on their vacations this year. I will report back when I get there. :)

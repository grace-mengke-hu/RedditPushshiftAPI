Couple of days

Back in May of last year I quit smoking to start vaping. It wasn’t long before I was back on cigarettes as the vape I had was cheap and didn’t do anything.

A month later I got a better vape and have been using it religiously since. In the past year I’d say I’ve smoked a handful of cigarettes, had a few drags off my pipe, and a couple of cigars.

So now I’m quitting everything all together. My last drag off the vape was Friday night, and already I’m feeling the effects. For me this includes extreme drowsiness. I expect the loss of concentration and headaches in a few days, but for now I’m finding it damn near impossible to keep my eyes open.

I woke up at 5 am today and made breakfast. By 730 I was out cold until 1pm. Got up again, ate, and have been in and out of consciousness on the couch since.

This is my first time quitting, and I’ve gotta say it feels similar to being hungover.

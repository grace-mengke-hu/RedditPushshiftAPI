I smoke like one day out of the week these days, but i quit anyway

im sick of this gross feeling in my lungs. I quit weed for good, now its time to quit tobacco for good. there is no reason to keep smoking. I have only been bumming cigs off of people at concerts on weekends but yeah I have been an on and off smoker for about four years.

I quit. It wont be too hard for me, but yeah that shits gross. I'm done

Rebel in me doesn't want to die

So....I went on champix, stopped it because it was making me super nauseas even with taking an anti nausea tablet with it and it made me feel so foggy in the head (but that could actually be a quitting nicotine affect and not the champix) but I felt overall shit and then I never really quit for longer than 5 days, I would be smoke free for the entire week, felt better for not leaving my desk every half hour to puff, but when the weekend rolled around I would go buy a pack and enjoy my wine and entire box of cigarettes as if I hadn't been not smoking the whole week. What the hell is the psychology behind this? The champix I would say, is really a miracle drug, it DOES WORK, it's just that, I can't go taking it and suffering the side effect (and the price) just to go and smoke every weekend! I feel like it's a "rebellious" act, if you will. That I am smoking because what? It's part of my personality. I can NEVER get through ONE social event without lighting up and having my wine. I want to quit both actually, because I tend to indulge in everything, it's all or nothing for me! Would understanding why, even while on champix, the best aid out (IMO) I feel I still "have to" smoke? I've been smoking full time again since Friday eve and I hate it I really do WANT to quit, I hate being a slave to this. I was coughing like mad again last night, which I haven't done for ages, just shows you, the stuff is lethal

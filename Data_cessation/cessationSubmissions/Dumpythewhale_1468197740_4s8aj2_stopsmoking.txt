Smoking and headaches?

Alright, as a prelude I'm 17 and have been vaping (and opportunistically smoking) for about a year. 

Recently (about 2 weeks ago) I started getting pains in my temples and eyes. Now I don't expect anyone to know why this is, they aren't like normal migraines I've had before, but I found vaping made it worse (I can assume from the blood vessels unconstricting when I'm done vaping). Would anyone happen to know why, after one year of consuming nicotine, I would just now start developing these odd headaches from it? Or has a one heard of this rather?

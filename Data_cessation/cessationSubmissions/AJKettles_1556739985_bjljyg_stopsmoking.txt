Anyone else with a family of smokers?

I’ve recently quick smoking (just passed a week today!) and my family are by far the most difficult to communicate with in terms of smoking.
Yesterday my grandfather passed away, so all of our distant family was down. EVERYONE was out in the garden smoking and talking and grieving. When they came back in, my auntie goes “so why is it that you NEED to give up?” And I said “if I don’t give up now I never will. I’m young and I’d rather nip it in the bud whilst I feel I can.” 
Her and my mother were trying to tempt me all day yesterday, but I didn’t give in. They said I should because I was grieving, that’s no excuse.
“Go on, just have one to calm you down” it’s never just one. I think my mum misses her ‘smoking buddy’. 

Has anyone else struggled with family not being supportive?

10 days, 21 hours

So I posted a few days ago. I quit due to an up coming surgery. I just want to let you all know what a huge difference quitting has already had on my health. My heart rate is down 30-40 beats per minute, my blood pressure is completely normal and my lungs are clear with no wheezing at all. My doctor and pulmonologist couldn’t believe it. I was cleared for surgery with no issues this time. I just had a shoulder arthroscopy a month ago and it took weeks for the doctor and pulmonologist to clear me. 

Guys, it’s hard, but totally worth it! Every time I get a craving (which is still pretty often.) I think about how different my health already is after only a few days. I can breath again! I can’t believe how much it was affecting my health without realizing it. 

It never too late for your body to heal! Good luck to everyone!!!

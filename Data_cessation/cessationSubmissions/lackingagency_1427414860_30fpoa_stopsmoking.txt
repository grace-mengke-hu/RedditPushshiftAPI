Quiting smoking is my reason to smile.

I am very self conscious about my teeth since they are either not straight or white enough. Regardless, I prefer not to use whitening toothpastes, and pretty much, just decided to live with my yellow teeth.

However, I was so surprised to see significant whitening that I've never thought is possible. Granted, they are maybe not at the level you can get by bleaching at the dentist's office.

Anyway, now my teeth are not offensively yellow. Actually, they are white enough for me to be more confident with my smile. 

Thank you!:)

Chantix side effect?

Iâ€™m on my 3rd day of Chantix and have been experiencing a side effect that was not mentioned by my Dr. 

About 45 minutes after taking the pill, I get a very tight feeling in my chest and have shortness of breath. The muscles in my neck get very stiff as well. I do also get stomach discomfort but my Dr told me that was to be expected. Has anyone else experienced this on Chantix?

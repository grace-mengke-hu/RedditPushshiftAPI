I quit

hey there

i have been smoking for quite some time now and i'm sick of it. my endurance is suffering, i feel exhausted quite frequently and i really don't want to die too soon. 

after several failed attempts so far i'm going to get myself an ecig without nicotine (these liquids are illegal here in switzerland) this afternoon and maybe some gum for the first period. 

wish me luck, looking forward to lurk in this subreddit in desperate times.

Struggling this morning

This morning is rough. I'm not having the intense "omg I must have a cigarette" cravings that were the first few days, but I've moved into the dull and ever-present "you could just go get a pack and no one would ever know but you" stage of things. This, to me, is even worse than acute cravings; it wears me down and has been the cause of my last couple failures at quitting.

Coping tips? This is exhausting.

Lads - you’ve got this.

Massive congrats to all of you who’ve done the right thing by sacking off stupid, expensive, poisonous cigarettes. Just wanted to check in and say that I’ve done 4.5 months smoke-free after smoking from age 13 to 33. And in that time I have... 
• separated from my spouse
• moved house twice 
• switched jobs 
• travelled to 6 countries 
• partied my ass off. Repeatedly

And not one of these things has been a good enough excuse to smoke. 

I have always told myself - smoking that cigarette will not make anything better. And I haven’t snapped once. Couple of close calls, but I made it. You can too.

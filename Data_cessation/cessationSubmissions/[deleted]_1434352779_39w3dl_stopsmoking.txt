How to avoid smoking while I drink?

Okay I read need some help here. Obviously I have my emotional triggers as we, but like most smokers, I can't not smoke while I drink. Rather, I smoke more than my usual amount while I'm drinking since the urge is simply amplified.
I quit a week ago and I haven't had an opportunity to drink since then. But that can't possibly be a permanent solution. 
Could some of you pros please share with us how you deal/have successfully dealt with this situation?

3 weeks and damn proud.

The first mentally torturous week seem miles away. I can't believe how far I've come on my first attempt. I never thought I'd get this far. The cravings are few and fairly easily dismissible at this point. I realize this is a great accomplishment, but no where near the end of the struggle. I will continue to be proactive against the brainwashing and nicotine monster. 

If there's anything I've learned from this experience it's that apathy was my biggest problem. When I was smoking I never actually thought about how I felt, how I smelled, how much I was spending, how much time I wasted, etc. I just got my fix and figured that was the way things were. It just was. This was an important realization for me. The more conscious I was about cigarettes and all the negatives the easier quitting seemed to become.

Anyway, cheers to everyone else who's making the pledge or who have already kicked the habit. Being a non-smoker is AWESOME!

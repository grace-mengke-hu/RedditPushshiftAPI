Weird question: Sweet smelling urine after stopping nicotine?

I can't find anyone who has described this via a google search/yahoo answers/etc. etc. So I'm throwing it out to you guys:

I'm getting on to 4 weeks clean of nicotine, and now I got the sweetest smelling urine, yes i know its a feature of diabetes (holy fuck that scares me), but I'm also told it can be indicative of other hormone related problems, and a friend of mine is telling me if nothing more, go to the GP, and if it's unexplainable, i'll get bumped to an endocrinologist (woot, go Ontario Healthcare!).


So, anyone else quit and find their urine smells very different (sweet in my case)? Just to really make the image clear, my dog has started drinking my urine. I don't flush the toilet at night, and I'll wake up now hearing my dog drinking away (never happened before as far as I can tell). I'm betting he's drinking it for the sugar... :\


EDIT: Answers of "No" are equally as appreciated from long time quitters, at least I'll know it's more likely something more serious, and then I'll know that walking into the doctor's office.

Back for day 1

At the time I'm posting this, my counter still shows 220 with pride. But I have been smoking for a while again.

After 5 months, I bought some cigarettes, because I had the feeling that they would help me study better for the last months of my masters degree and I had some depressive issues. I wanted to smoke some cigars, but because they take more time and I was on a holiday, it quickly became cigarettes gain.

At first it was alright, but it quickly became bothersome again and I became interested in quitting again. And so here I am again. Tomorrow it is liberation day in the Netherlands, which I find a beautiful day to liberate myself from this addiction for good. 

I know I can do it because I've quit multiple times before. And in the past months I've learned a lot about myself, my melancholic temperament and how to make sure I continue to feel good and stable, even when I'm in a slightly depressed period.

I've thought about continuing to smoke cigars, but I'm learning to accept that I can't just smoke the occasional cigar, just like the occasional cigarrete. And that I value my health more than the occasional cigar or cigarette.

So here is to my final quitting date. 05-05-2016.

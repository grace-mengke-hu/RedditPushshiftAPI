Harder now than ever

I've been a lurker here since I decided to quit cold turkey on 11/13/14. This community and the people here supported me and continue to support me more than you will know. Seeing the success stories here is inspiring and motivating. Thank you.



The last two weeks I have really struggled with cravings. Last week, I decided I needed a break from smoking weed and am 9 days into a 'T break'. Surprisingly, I do not crave weed; I crave cigarettes.



I'm not sure what the purpose of my post is, other than to say thanks to everyone here. I guess I might be begging for encouragement too. I'm having dreams where I smoke and wake up in a panic. This is a first for me. The devil in me says I will be able to quit again If i have a cig, but I know that is temptation at its worst. I don't want to reset the clock. I won't smoke, I know that, but the thought of losing control is scary.

72h since my last cigarette, still trying to remain strong

Greetings everyone.
On monday i decided to quit this stupid habit. I am 26 years old and i used to smoke 1 pack a day and my method to quit was cold turkey.
One of my main reasons to stop smoking is the need to carry on with a healthy life. Smoking takes most of my apetite resulting in a really low weight. Apart from this, other reasons is my girlfriend and obviously the expense of buying cigarettes. As most of you said, i try to realize the concept of the attempt to smoke 1 cigarette will blow all my efforts, and that is making me remain strong about quitting. 
It's not easy though, i still struggle with carving in situations like after a meal, taking a break from work or in stressful situations.
Next monday i will start to go to the gym and i hope to psychologically realize that with time i am a non-smoker for ever.

To finish i just want to say to all of you to remain strong and that one of my biggest motivations that i didn't mentioned before is you. I am amazed by your stories and accomplishments. Keep strong! 

PS: Sorry for my bad english

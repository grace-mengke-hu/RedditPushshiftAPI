Milestone!

After 27 days I really haven't noticed too many big differences except smelling things more. Every day I have to change trains, and if I hurry I can usually go from one straight to the next, but it requires hoofing it up two flights of stairs and down the platform (it's an express and is a shorter train). Anyway, today I booked it up those stairs and into the car without loaing a lung for the first. time. ever. So happy. I smoked for 21 years.

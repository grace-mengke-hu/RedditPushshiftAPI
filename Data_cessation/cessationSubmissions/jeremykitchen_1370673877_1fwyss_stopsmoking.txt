two weeks!

So, it hasn't yet been 2 weeks to the hour, but dammit it's been close enough!

Yesterday I had an appointment with my shrink, my first since I quit, and I noticed while telling her about my quitting that I hadn't had a craving all day!

Also, I went out for drinks with a friend on Tuesday night and didn't even *want* a smoke, let alone have any. A huge departure from the chain smoking I used to do while drinking.

It's definitely getting easier. For those of you in your first couple of days, keep it up, you'll thank yourself later!

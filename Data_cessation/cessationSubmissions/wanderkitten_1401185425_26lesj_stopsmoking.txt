I've been 1 week without cigarettes.. my skin is breaking out like crazy? help me?

so I'm a 19 year old female and my skin has always had acne here and there, or occasional breakouts but my skin is seriously looking like a pepperoni pizza now. 

Can anyone relate? 
when does it end? 
should I just go to the gym and eat healthily? 

WHEN DOES THIS END

(I've been smoking for 2 years.)

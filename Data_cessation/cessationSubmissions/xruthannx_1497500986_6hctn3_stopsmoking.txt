how do i help my bf quit?

my boyfriend, as many in america, is a smoker. in his case, he tried it & hated it, with no intention of continuing... but after realization of how relaxed he felt afterwards.. he continued. this habit was started very young and now as a junior in high school the side effects are visible in his daily life (coughing 24/7, along with asthma). as his girlfriend i am not a huge fan of him smoking, but do understand addiction is very real. often times he will avoid smoking around me, but he enjoys a cig while driving. keep in mind, this is all new to me, so being helpful in this quitting process is difficult. i will encourage him not to buy/smoke cigs which is a very temporary solution to a legitimate problem. he is a very relaxed & kind person but irritability skyrockets when he doesn't smoke & i do not handle that well. i encourage him to quit, but often get annoyed with the side effects & am not overly helpful. often times we both lack patience in this process. me being upset with his irritability makes him want to grab a cig, relax and gain back his patience. i would love for him to quit & want to support him doing so in more effective, long-term ways. any advice??

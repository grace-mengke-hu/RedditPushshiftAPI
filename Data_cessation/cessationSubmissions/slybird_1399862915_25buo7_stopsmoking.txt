I had three puffs of a cigarette last night. Do I need to restart my counters?

130 days cold turkey. For my counter to be accurate should I reset? Or do I leave counter as is? 

My counter is a dollar amount set at $10 a day. Do I need to reset that bank account? Empty the bank account and start over?

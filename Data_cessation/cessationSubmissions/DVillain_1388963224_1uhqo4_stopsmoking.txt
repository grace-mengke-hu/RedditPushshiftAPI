Smoking and your social circle

Hey guys, quit many times but this time it's for real. Just hit 3 weeks today. I wanted to know how you handle social situations where your friends smoke around you? I just got back to university and all my flatmates smoke. I am managing to refrain from smoking but this is the first time I've had seriously bad cravings. 

How do you guys handle it when you spend time around people you used to smoke with all the time? One of the things that made me feel good was the fact I was able to stick to my guns; I felt victorious about the fact I really wanted to but didn't give in. I hope these little victories will be what helps me through it. How do you cope?

Restart after Relapse

So, I stopped smoking on 1st January. Made it for three months and it was laughably easy. I was so astonished how strong I was. Going out and drinking? No problem. Shitty Dates? No problem. Many hour long band-rehearsals? Also no problem.

But then came this one bad job-interview that shouldn't even have bothered me - but it did. I smoked one, a second, a third... Turns out I started again for the last two months.

My stint as being unemployed now seems to come to an end and I'll do it again. I'll stop and I'll make it more than three months this time - if I can not a single cigarette ever again.

I felt so much better without smoking - i was insane. I wanna get there again.
I don't even know what I am on about, think I just wanted to tell you people what's up. :)

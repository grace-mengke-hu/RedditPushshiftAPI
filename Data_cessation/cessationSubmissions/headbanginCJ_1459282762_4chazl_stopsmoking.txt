My Story (which is all to common I feel)

I'm new to this subreddit but last night was really the last straw for me, so I thought I may as well share my story.

As a pretty care-free 17 year old half way through college (UK) cigarettes were always quite interesting to me, especially due to my Dad's semi controlling attitude with a lot of things. I became a 'social smoker' and I would only smoke if someone offered one. This carried on very steadily with me smoking maybe once or twice a month - "nothing right?!". Then came University. The freedom attained once one is living on there own is enough for anyone to get into bad habits, mine just happened to be smoking. The numbers slowly crept up until I was around 5 a day at peak. Over the past couple of months I have made many conscious efforts to cut down and restrict but I've finally come to accept that the only way to truly succeed is to cut it out completely. I find that the daytime is MUCH easier to deal with than the night time, mainly because of how much I used to enjoy going outside for a few minutes to enjoy the cool air. I'm so glad that this subreddit exists, we can all do this! Day 1 is almost up :-) 

Edit: I realise that the title uses the wrong 'too'.

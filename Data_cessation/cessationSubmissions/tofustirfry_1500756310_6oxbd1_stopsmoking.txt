Day 11: No smokes, no drinks, Yes workout, Yes meal prep

Good morning! On Day 11 of double addiction removal, I am starting to do meal prep so I can portion control, count calories, and save a lot of time and money in the kitchen. I already mainly cook from home so it won't be that big of a change but doing a weeks worth of meals in one go will be awesome:-) inspired by another subreddit so here we go:-)

Go my third day of working out in yesterday with a tricep and trap/abs day. Today will be legs.

Life is moving along very smoothly nowadays with almost zero cigarette cravings and only the minor "missing" of alcohol in various settings. The addiction voices have gone to sleep - for now at least. Always need to be prepared for if/when they wake.

Hope you all have a great Saturday! I will not smoke with you today!

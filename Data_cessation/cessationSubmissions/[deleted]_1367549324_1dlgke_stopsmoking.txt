Checking in at 4 months

Hit 4 months today from quitting a pack plus/day, 11 year habit 100% cold turkey. Haven't slipped up once. Not even a drag.

One thing I wish I had known a long time ago is that being a former smoker **doesn't** haunt me every day like I always thought it would. People say smoking is harder to quit than heroin, so I always assumed that smoking would be a monkey on my back for years and years to come after quitting like ex heroin addicts complain of with their addiction. In reality, though, I rarely think of smoking at all anymore and am totally unfazed by being near them or smelling them (about 80% of my friends are regular smokers still). I just wish I knew it would be so easy sooner than now.

So glad to be done with this. I've saved over $800 already and my belongings, house, and I don't reek anymore. I just feel healthier in almost every respect.

Stay strong guys. It gets way easier after the 1st month.

I think I might smoke again right before my big test, is this a disastrous idea?

I've got the LSATs coming up and I've been thinking it might give me a boost to smoke a cigarette before the test. 

So I know the obvious answer I should be expecting is: "Don't do that, its stupid." That's what I've heard from all the people I've brought this up to. 

But I quit more than a year ago now, cold turkey, and I can't imagine one cigarette sending me running back. And it seems like in this sort of situation there are some obvious performance enhancing benefits. Chemically it speeds up your brain, plus I imagine it'll really curb any nerves I'm feeling at the time. 

So I'm asking you guys who would probably know, this isn't necessarily a big deal right?

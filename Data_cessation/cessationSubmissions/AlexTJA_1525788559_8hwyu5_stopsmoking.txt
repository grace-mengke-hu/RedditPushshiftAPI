Day 5 using nicotine gum

been smoking for 7 years. tried many times to quit before with varying success. a few times cold turkey, a few times with the patch, but I’ve never tried the gum. so far it’s working great and while occasionally the desire to smoke a cigarette is still there, it isn’t very strong. the gum at least stops me from having that complete freak out feeling that always makes me buy another pack when I try to quit. 

does anyone here have any success stories while using the gum? I’m worried because I don’t want to be addicted to nicotine at all. I’ve read stories of people who just keep chewing the gum for years and years. I want to be free from nicotine completely, especially since I’ve read a good amount of the Allen Carr book and I get it. I’m sure I’ll finish it one day soon and maybe that will help kick the gum, but much like the patch I know you’re supposed to finish the “cycle” completely for it to “work”. 

so I’m worried that if I cheat and try to stop early it won’t be effective and I’ll start smoking again. but I also don’t want to be chewing gum for like 4 months or for the rest of my life. even some days when I don’t feel I need a piece, I still try to reach that recommended daily amount of pieces used. 

either way it feels great to be almost a whole week without smoking a single cigarette. my body is already thanking me. my wallet is definitely thanking me. all I have to do is commit to never smoking a single cigarette again and I’ve got this!

day one (again)

so im quitting again for what feels like the 100th time. ive been smoking on and off for about 15 years and its time to quit again. i need this one to stick. I definatly have 10 more years of smoking left in me but im not sure if i have another quit in me after this one. 

so this is my latest and last day one

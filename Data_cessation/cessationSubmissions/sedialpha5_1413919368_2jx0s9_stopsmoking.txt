26 hours since the last cigarette. Was a smoker for 8 years.

This is gonna be all over the place but here goes: 
* There are lots of reasons I am giving up cigarettes. 
* I want to be a good mom to my step son. When he looks for me he always goes outside first.. I guess that's where I usually was.. sitting outside, smoking and playing hearthstone on my ipad..
*I want to have my own children. My mom smoked when she was preggers with me (1980's) and I was born with asthma which is much worse when I smoke.
*I need to be healthier. Smoking has made me susceptible to more infections.. I am just getting over a severe sinus infection that took me out for 8 days..
*My dad has lung cancer.. he has smoked for 50 years farmer style.. no filters.. 
*Work: is starting to look down on the smokers.. management seems fed up about the smokers going outside for 10 minutes every hour.. I want to succeed here. 


I start to think now about what I enjoyed about it to help put it into perspective.. I used smoking initially as a social outlet. Go outside, hang out with the other smoking people.. Talk about the day/weather etc..  and that's really about the only thing ill miss. But I have my fiancee, step son and Reddit now. Now instead of smoke breaks, ill have reddit breaks.

thanks reddit!
I can do this!

Now starts the no smoking journey.

After an increase from a 'casual' smoker for about a year, to getting more progressive (adding more and more every day) my friend found out. I usually only smoked socially with friends who smoked, or one or two before and after work. Today, a non-smoking friend got in my car after I had just smoked and noticed right away.

I'm 17 and have been smoking for about a year now. I had about half a pack left, and we decided I was going to smoke it all away. My max has always been 3, and I could only get to 7. He made sure that I was inhaling deep and hard, so I could feel the effects of how harshly it was treating my body. Yes, it was dumb. But oh-so effective. I couldn't even stand, I was so light headed.

I know this isn't the end. I know I'll find away to smoke more. But this won't mean I'm not quitting. One day at a time.

edit: Okay so I guess not a lot of people got the concept of me admitting that I am addicted. I never denied it, so I didn't understand why people kept commenting like they had. YES I KNOW I'M ADDICTED. Cold turkey is hard, and I know that I'm not strong enough to quit that way. Of course, my goal is to quit. But I know that I will have a relapse.

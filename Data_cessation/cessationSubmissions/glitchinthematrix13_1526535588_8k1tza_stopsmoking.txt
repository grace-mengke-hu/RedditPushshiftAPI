Once you get through the physical withdrawals, the hardest part is nostalgia.

I switched from smoking to vaping then quit vaping. I see vaping as a cessation tool but it doesn't give you the same high as a cigarette. Some of the best memories of my life were filled with cigarettes. It reminds me of all the good times in high school and early college. Im moving on now and almost graduating. Its enticing the get a glimpse of the past by smoking.

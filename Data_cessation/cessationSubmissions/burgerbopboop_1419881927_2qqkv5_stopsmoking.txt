The SO and I quit Saturday morning with the help of e-cigs.

After visiting with family for Christmas we were surprised to see that both my parents and his own sister and brother in-law had quit smoking with the help of the E-cigs.  so we got a couple our selves.  it has been way easier then we thought (because we are still getting small doses of nicotine).  I now it's only been 3 days but i feel very optimistic.

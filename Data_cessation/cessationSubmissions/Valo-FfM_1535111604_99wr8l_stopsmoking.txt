24 Days SmokeFree

At first I want to say that I do feel great.

I can take deeper breaths, don´t feel tired after walking up the hill from the supermarket to my home and I´m less low energy in general and my room doesn´t smell like cigarettes all the time.

Only time I still get cravings is after waking up, but I can fight through them pretty fast.

Longest quit for me by a good shot and I want to go on.

101 days of awesome!

Hi guys! I just wanted to share with you my happiness. I quit smoking 117 days ago... Had a small accident 16 days in so I had to reset the counter and my heart was broken... Then so many of you told me to man-up, stop whining and just do it! Well guess what... I did it! 101 days and I feel free, happy and awesome. Occasional though of smoking is still there, but it's nothing really. I can go and have drinks whole night and not really think that I need a smoke.

Living smoke free is a new quality of life. And it gives you so much beliefe in yourself that is incredible... Did I mention that it significantly helped me to save for my new Macbook Pro I rewarded myself with? (smoking in UK is super expensive!).

TLDR: Everything is awesome, thank you /stopsmoking!

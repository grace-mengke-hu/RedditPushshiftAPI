Quitting and self-loathing

I quit for a year a few years ago and then got back on the wagon for a year. I feel completely demoralized on this most recent series of 3-5-day quit attempts. It's like all the determination in the world doesn't make any difference for the future -whether or not I'll actually quit seems more like a matter of blind chance than of any effort on my part.

After spending all day yesterday (day 3) in my bedroom suffering through 18 hours of cravings and nearly breaking down into a crying fit, I've decided to smoke until the 20th (when my students' grades are due) and then try again. 

But nothing I say here matters. None of this matters.

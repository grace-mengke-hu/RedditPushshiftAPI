Where to by Nicotine Patches/Gum in Canada

I am in the middle of my NRT program (step 2 nicodern patches). I'll be on vacation in Canada for two weeks.   
As an american citizen can I purchase nicotine patches and/or gum in Canada and if so, where?  
Do they sell them in Walmart or drugstores like they do here? I probably sound really silly asking that but I've never been there and want to have a plan in place so I don't break down and buy cigs.   
Also, am I allowed to bring them accross the border (I get that this is a pretty specific question so if no one knows the answer I get it - couldn't find anything about it on the customs site). 

  
Thanks!

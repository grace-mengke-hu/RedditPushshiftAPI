* Sorry if my topic is not so positive , also sorry for my broken english . * I been a smoker for more than 12 years i used to smoke 30 cig.s a day . 
* Today is my 7th day without smoking , but i have a problem , i read that after 3 days you will not gonna feel that you need to smoke , but its been 7 days and i still have a headache and still have the feel that i need to smoke , is that normal ? does it take that long to this feeling to go away ?

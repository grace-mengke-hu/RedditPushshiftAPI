Tips for social smoking

I smoked for 3 years, then I decided I should quit. But sadly I quit once every week because everytime I find myself at a party or any gathering with friends, I drink a little then smoke.

I need some tips how to avoid smoking in these situations, but without eliminating them . Thank ya kind people !

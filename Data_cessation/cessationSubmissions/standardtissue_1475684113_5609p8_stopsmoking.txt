cant think or wake up. when does that end ?

I've been off cigs for probably 3, 4 months now, completely off all nicotine for about 3 weeks. 

i can't think, can't wake up, just want to sleep.  feels like being in a massive, massive hangover without the headache.  

when does this phase end ?  Anything I can do to help hurry it along ?

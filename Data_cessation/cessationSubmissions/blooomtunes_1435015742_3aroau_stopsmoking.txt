Vaping? E-Cigs? I want to hear your experiences.

Hey all, 

I am desperate to quit smoking and have begun vaping - I know their are various studies for and against, but wanted to hear what your experiences have been with vaping and E-cigs? 

Also - did you experience any health benefits when transitioning to vaping? 

Thanks, 

Scott.

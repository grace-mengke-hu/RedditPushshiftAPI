Well, well, well. My old arch nemesis, we meet again.

I was going through a box of winter clothes looking for a hat I wanted to wear and came across an old coat I hadn't worn in a while. I picked it up and happened to feel something solid in one of the inside pockets. It was a pack of cigarettes, my old favorite brand, and it wasn't even opened. I held it in my hand and remembered that I used to grab several packs before going out drinking due to the constant fear of being without a smoke when I wanted one. I must have forgotten it was in there when I put my winter clothes away for the year. I stared at it for awhile and against my better judgement, finally decided to open it and just take a smell. I pulled the plastic wrap off, opened the foil up and was immediately hit with the menthol fragrance I had become so familiar with after 15 years of smoking them. I knew what was going to happen next. I put my shoes on, threw on the old winter coat(it still smelled faintly of smoke) and went out to the garage. I took the pack out of my pocket, opened the top, looked at the tightly packed rows of white cylinders.......and crushed those little fuckers in my fist and threw them away with the rest of the garbage! It felt pretty great. I also washed the coat because it smelled like shit. Stay strong everyone!

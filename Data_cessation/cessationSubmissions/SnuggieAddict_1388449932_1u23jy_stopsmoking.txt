A personal tip for those about to quit!

So, here's a tip which helped me tremendously.

Let's say your new years resolution is to stop smoking. Awesome!
So you still got new year's eve to smoke, right?

Well, go ahead and smoke. Smoke more than you're used to. Smoke until you get a headache, until you're sick, until you smell like a living ashtray. Smoke until you're wheezing and coughing, and just can't take it anymore.

And then - smoke your last cigarette. Smell your hands, reeking of nicotine. Feel the throbbing headache. Feel the nausea waves. Feel yourself getting sick, and know - the cigarette made you feel this way.

Put it out. That's it. You're Free.

The next days will be a bitch to handle, somewhat like a really bad flu. Each time you have a craving for a smoke, in the next few days, weeks, or months (yup - I'm hitting the 8 months mark and still get craving, though not as bad as I used to), think about tonight. Think about how miserable you felt. Try to remember the sensations of smell and taste. Now think about it - Are you really going through this hell again?

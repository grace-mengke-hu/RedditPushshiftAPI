First day

I've been smoking for 10 years.
It's so weird to say that. I'm 29, and for a third of my life, I've been a smoker.
Not a heavy smoker - usually around 6 or 7 a day. If I was drinking, that number would shoot up. God forbid I was at a cottage in the summer, barbecuing and guzzling beer - a pack and a half wouldn't be outrageous.
I've tried to quit over the years. Tried the patch. Tried that Easy Way to Quit Smoking book. Now, I'm finally trying just going cold turkey.
I'm sick of it. I'm sick of having to lie to my parents (who hate smoking) when I go over for dinner that my teeth are yellow because I've been drinking too much coffee. I'm sick of the fact that running, something I used to enjoy immensely, has become harder and harder, to the point where I'm dying after a mile, when I used to run four several times a week.
I'm sick of the fact that taking a deep breath has become harder, lately. 
I thought that since I wasn't a heavy smoker, I wouldn't feel the effects. I thought I was otherwise in good shape. I was wrong.
Last week, I went two days without a smoke, and then I relapsed. Today, I'm trying to start again.
I haven't had a cigarette in about 11 hours. I'm jittery, but I'm ok.
Wish me luck.

Anyone want to be my quit buddy?

I have been smoking a pack a day for almost 20 years. Next week I turn 40. I am a professional, successful woman. Creative, liberal, educated. Smoking is not who I am, yet it feels like my entire identity is wrapped up in it. 

I have a quit date in my head and am thinking how wonderful it would be to have a quit buddy. We could use kik. PM if you’re interested in the job! 

Also, respiratory infections fucking suck when you’re a smoker. I’m glad they do because it’s a needed wake up call. My poor body has been so kind to me. I need to return the favor.

Just four days in

How do I stop grinding my teeth and shaking my legs? It's not much of a nuisance to me but I'm pretty sure that I am coming from off as someone who is on meth withdrawals. Ive been eating peanuts everytime I feel myself grinding my teeth but at about a pound in,  I feel as if I have been abusing them.

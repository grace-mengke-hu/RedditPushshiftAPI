Two month ago it was unbelievable

I’m not smoking for two months. After 8 years of one-two packs a day, it’s really amazing feelings. I’m so proud of me! I don’t want to smoke at all, I gained five kilos, but it’s fine, I started to have gym and running this month. Good luck guys, it’s real and it’s amazing feeling of freedom. Don’t give up on the first week!

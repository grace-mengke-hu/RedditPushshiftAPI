Almost through two days, and am feeling "down."

(Smoker of six years - tried to quit twice before. Longest was six months.)

Hi all, just about through my first two days, now, I know this is much. And have quit for six months cold turkey before. But this time I'm coming off what can only be described as my worst hangover to date. I am quite sure that my feeling of depression is from coming off this birthday bender of drinking - however, I really am feeling like my cigarettes would be a nice security blanket but don't want to give in. Which is kind of adding to my downer feelings. Any tips or words of advice?

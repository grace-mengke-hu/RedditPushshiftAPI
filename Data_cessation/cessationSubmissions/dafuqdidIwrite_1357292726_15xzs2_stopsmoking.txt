Can I still get some support here if I don't plan on quitting? 

Started smoking one year after i left finished my graduation. 29 year old Male here, smoking clove cigarettes for around 6 year. However, it was never more than a pack a day. For last year or year n a half, it started increasing. 2 packs a day to even 3 packs a day on a regular basis. 

Decided to start 2013 with a break... Plan to stay off cigarettes for at least a month. 4 days into it and am actually feeling the urge to have just one damn cigarette! But have promised myself to stay off at least for a month so thought will see if typing it in here could actually help me help myself! Am a copywriter by profession and have been sitting in front of this damn system having trouble finishing a damn piece! Time for another coffee I guess 


EDIT: Thought to keep updating this here as a reward for myself! 


**SCREWED UP! Sorry guys...!** 


Goal: 30 Cigarettes a Day to 30 Days No Cigarettes!

Just quit after a family death related to smoking looking for help / advice / tips can't afford any NRT

Haven't even made it through a full 24 hours yet [badge is a bit wrong cause Australian time], I can't afford any NRT / substitute are there any tips in exercise / diet ect that can aid me?

 Also wondering if something is normal. I never coughed as a smoker for many years but since about 6 hrs ago [14 hrs since last smoke which is near the biggest gap I've had between smokes is 18 hrs flying from Aus to Ireland but I didn't cough then thought it was some time back], but I have been coughing a fair bit since stopping is this normal? if so why?

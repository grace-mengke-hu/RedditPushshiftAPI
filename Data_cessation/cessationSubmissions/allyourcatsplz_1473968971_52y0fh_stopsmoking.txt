Day 3

Nth attempt to quit, but I want this to be the attempt that sticks. My longest so far was 12 days. My minimum goal is 13 days and then the rest of my life. 
By the time I made it to day 10, the cravings had pretty much died and I was doing well with it. I had figured out effective and healthy ways to distract myself until the craving passed, and had started to form new habits in place of lighting up. Until we went to a bar that allowed smoking inside and well whiskey for cheap. And I fell right back in to it like nothing had changed, except with the guilt of failing myself. I'm not going to put myself to that temptation so early on again. 


My nails are chewed down to nubs, and I was a royal bitch to my bf about something pretty dumb. But I've also talked myself out of going and getting cigarettes several times, consumed 2L of water, and walked 4 miles around my apartment complex today.

 
I've been lurking this sub for a few weeks now and love the support everyone shares with one another. We can all be non-smokers!

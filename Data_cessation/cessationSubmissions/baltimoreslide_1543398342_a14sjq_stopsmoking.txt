For writers who think they must smoke to write (or for Elena Ferrante readers)

This might not resonate with everyone, but I wanna print it out and put it on my wall.  
[Elena Ferrante: Writing While Smoking Was A Deceptive Pleasure](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/elena-ferrante-writing-while-smoking-was-a-deceptive-pleasure)  


&gt;"I discovered that I couldn’t let go of cigarettes, because I was afraid of seeing the world in all its sharp-edged clarity. Cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine are to varying degrees dark glasses, and give us the impression that we can more readily tolerate the collision with life, more comfortably savour it.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But is that true? That what enslaves us empowers us? For months I believed that, without lighting a cigarette, I would be unable to write even half a line, that writing, the thing I most cared about, would be barred to me for ever. Sometimes even today, when I haven’t smoked for many years, I feel convinced of that and am on the point of giving in. I’ve saved myself only because a very weak part of me murmurs that it’s nonsense, that, really, soothing myself with 40 cigarettes a day for so long kept me from writing as I should have."

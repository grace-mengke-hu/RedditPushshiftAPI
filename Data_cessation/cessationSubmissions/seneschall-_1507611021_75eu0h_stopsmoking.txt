What is nicotine gum supposed to do besides the obvious? As in instant side-effects?

I find it hard to breath, sore throat, and hiccups as well. Miserable, but only lasts the first several minutes though, and nothing too untolerable. 

Am I allergic, or is this something that just happens due to the nature of the gum?

It's what the VA (USA) gives us.  Nicotine Polacrilex Gum, 4mg.

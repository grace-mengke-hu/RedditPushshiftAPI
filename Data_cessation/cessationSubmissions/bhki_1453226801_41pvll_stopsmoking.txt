How to handle my girlfriend

I quit smoking on this new year and today I shared the progress I have achieved from new year to my girlfriend . I thought she ll congratulate me and encourage me. But she is fighting with me asking why is it hard for you to quit it. Where you so much addicted to. I don't even understand what I should do now. Please help

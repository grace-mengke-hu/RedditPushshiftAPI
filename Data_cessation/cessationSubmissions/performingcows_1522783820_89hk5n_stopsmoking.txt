digestion after quitting

I'm gonna talk about shitting after quitting, so don't read if that bothers you.

I was extremely bloated and couldn't go hardly at all for about a week. Last night it got painful, extremely bloated, farts from hell. And today it just exploded out of me, I've been more or less glued to the toilet. 
Anyone else experiencing this nasty side effect? and when does it finally normalize?
(I've always had pretty normal and fast digestion and I eat well, smoked for two years, quit for a good week with a couple of slip ups now)

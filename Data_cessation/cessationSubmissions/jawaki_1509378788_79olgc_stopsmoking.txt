3 weeks w/o nicotine, still hell, tension headaches and brainfog all day, every day.

Pretty much what the title describes. Starting to get scared I selfmedicated against something else during my years as a snus user. Really hope my brain is about to return to normal soon, did not have these problems the last times I've quit in the past, however this might be the longest I've ever gone without any nicotine for some 5 years+.

Not sure what to think, mental problems or still withdrawal, maybe somekind of depression as a result of quitting, who knows.

In any case, thank you all for listening to my rant.

Day 19 - Things I'm Glad Have Changed

This is my 3rd quit in 3 years, with the longest length being 6 months. 

I'm now 19 days into my previous quit, and the things I'm grateful for this time around are so much clearer than before. 

I feel so much better. I can run again without feeling heavy and out of breath. 

I wake up in the morning and have energy right away. 

I'm no longer dead tired at the end of the day, and rewarding myself with a drink and a cigarette. I used to do this every evening, and I didn't really enjoy it, but in my mind I had convinced myself that this was how to unwind at the end of the day. I now go for a walk or just enjoy some time with my partner. 

My partner is much more attracted to me. She always had a clear distaste for smoking, and I find that now she's much more affectionate. I don't blame her, as the smell is atrocious. 

I have much healthier coping strategies. Whether it's going for a walk to clear. My thoughts, having a drink of water, or meditating, I feel much more grounded and attentive to my surroundings. 

I have much more free time! Who knew that popping out for 10 minutes every two hours adds up. .

Finally, I feel like I'm finding out what it's like to spend time with myself again, if that makes any sense. Smoking is part of my addiction pattern with alcohol, always hiding behind something to feel different. Now I'm much more at peace with who I am. It's great.

Thanks for letting me share! Keep it up!

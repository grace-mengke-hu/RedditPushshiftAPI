Is anyone else worried about being able to quit smoking in the long term?

I am a non-smoker 95% of the time now, I quit years ago, but each time something really bad happens in my life, I start smoking again. For only a few days usually (2-3 days), but sometimes longer (a few weeks sometimes, and once for two months after a bad breakup).

How do you guys overcome this? I sometimes feel like I will never be able to *really* quit, that shit will always happen in my life and that I will always start again. I have been in this half-smoking mode for about 6 years now, and I feel like there is no way for me to solve this issue.

This really upsets me because when shit happens, I start smoking, and I feel even worse, because I started smoking again. After many months without smoking, I feel like I'm not a smoker and that obviously I'll never smoke again, and yet it *always* happens again. This is really putting me down. Shit went really bad in my life about two weeks ago and I started again, and it makes me feel really miserable. I'm working on quitting again, and I don't doubt I'll manage it, but it pisses me off that I'm unable to manage this long-term.

Any tips?

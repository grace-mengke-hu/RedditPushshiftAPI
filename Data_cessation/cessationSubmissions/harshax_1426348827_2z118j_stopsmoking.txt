Chantix - What's the exit strategy?

When I hit 60 days, I'm going to wind down my usage of Chantix. My physician has suggested I halve my dosage every week until I'm down to .5mg every other day, then I should quit completely. Any advice about what to expect mentally and physically, during and after, from those who have already weened themselves off Chantix?

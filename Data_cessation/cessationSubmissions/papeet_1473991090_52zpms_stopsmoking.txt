5 days

Alright so I'm 5 days clean. And fuck it has been hard. Anyway my biggest fear is me not being able to drink and enjoy my self anymore. Smoked for 5 years (17-22) the party years. All i do is drink and smoke for as long as I can remember. The only time I didn't hate myself for smoking was when I was fucked up. All my friends still smoke so I'm really scared to drink with them. I'm kinda just asking for hope.

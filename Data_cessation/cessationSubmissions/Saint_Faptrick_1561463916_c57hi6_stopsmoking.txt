I had my first dream!

I've had about 5 cigarettes in the last few weeks and NONE in the last week. I couldn't do cold turkey, so this is what's working for me. Anyway, last night I had a dream that I broke down and had a smoke. As I understand it, this is fairly common in former smokers. It's nice to be able to relate to my friends who are former smokers

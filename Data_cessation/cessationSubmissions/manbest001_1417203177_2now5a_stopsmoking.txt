19 days smoke-free!

Hello there all, its been 19 complete days without a cigarette not even touched a cigarette but tonight just 10 min ago i had a huge crave and i resisted. 2 of my colleagues after a coffee together, tryed to convince me to smoke a cigarette but no way to accept a puff. i think i can do it forever this time.

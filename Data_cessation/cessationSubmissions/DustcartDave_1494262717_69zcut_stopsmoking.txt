Just thinking out loud.

(M 38, half to 1 pack a day for 15 years.)  I quit, cold turkey for 6 months back in 2015, and found it incredibly easy, the only real motivation back then was financial, I just couldn't afford to do it anymore. This time is different though. I have come to the very real, realisation, that smoking has, some pretty fucking serious consequences. My dad died, just over a month ago, the ultimate cause being, that he smoked for over 40 years. The problem I've got now is, I know I'm never going to smoke again, and in a way that's made it more difficult, if you get what I mean? I'm not finding it physically, any more uncomfortable than last time I quit, but that little fucker in my head, just won't give up! It's almost like it knows its time is up, and is using every trick in the book to try and delay its demise, even though it's got no fucking chance! Don't know where I was going with this, just thought I'd share how I was feeling. Stay strong, people.

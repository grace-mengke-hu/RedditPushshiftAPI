Vaporising Herbs instead of smoking them?

Once and for all I decided to quit smoking. I'm without Tobacco 26 hours and it goes quite okay. I only experience minor cravings which I am able to get rid off.

What I am thinking about now is that I occasionally like to smoke some good green bud and other herbs and I don't really want to give this up. So, no more joints for me.

So, how about vaporizing them? It seems to be much healthier than burning the material. Does anyone have experiences how an ongoing cigarette withdrawal interacts with vaporizing weeds and different herbs? Is it a good idea to start this or rather not?

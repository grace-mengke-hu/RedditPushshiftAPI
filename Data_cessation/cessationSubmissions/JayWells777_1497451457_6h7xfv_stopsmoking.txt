PTSD and quitting smoking.

I've been a smoker for about 15 years. I started smoking in the Army and was medically retired after 8 years of service. I've been diagnosed with PTSD as well as a couple other anxieties and wheneverâ€‹ I make an attempt to quit smoking my anxiety goes nuts, I mean near constant panic attacks nuts. I've tried to quit many times and even managed to quit for 18 months but I blew it on the 4th of July. Does anyone else have horrible anxiety when attempting to quit? I'm a stay at home daddy now with two amazing little girls and I hate the thought of being snappy with them when I'm trying to quit. Any tips or relatable stories would help. Also I'm pretty new to Reddit so sorry for any noob mistakes but that's for the help.

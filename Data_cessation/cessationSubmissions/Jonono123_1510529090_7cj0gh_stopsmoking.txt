22 days without smoking and I’m losing control of my weight

Î have used snacking as a way to fight cravings and í had lost weight before ì quit so ì had some wiggle room but now ì have gained all the weight i lost and am scared of ì start watching what I’m eating then I’ll start smoking. How do I move forward and when will cravings stop? It’s really not getting easier.

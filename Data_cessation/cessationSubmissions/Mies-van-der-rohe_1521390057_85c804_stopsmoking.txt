Hung out with smokers all night and didn't cave!

Last night I went out to a couple bars where smoking is allowed indoors and I did not cave. Wanted to share because I never thought I'd be able to go out and refrain from cigs, but it does get easier.

That being said, I will probably avoid going back because the more I frequent these places, the more likely I'll relapse. Same thing goes for the social group and who I hang out with. I missed those folks though!

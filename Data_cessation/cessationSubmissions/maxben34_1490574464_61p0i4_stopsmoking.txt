A way to quit smoking proven by science:

Step 1: Ask a friend of yours to help you out with the following steps by making sure that you will follow through on your commitment. 
  
Step 2: Find an organization that you are utterly against and fundamentally disagree with. One that makes you angry and disgusted. 
  
Step 3: Tell your friend that if you smoke (if they find out) that you have to give $1000 (or some outrageously large amount of money) to that organization.
  
Step 4: Trust yourself to actually follow through in the case that you break this commitment. 
  
Not only will you be losing a lot of money if you decide to smoke a cigarette, but also, your money will be going to an organization or group of people that you absolutely, fundamentally hate. For both of those reasons, you will be reminded of this outcome each and every time you come near cigarettes. 
  
Hope you find this advice helpful.

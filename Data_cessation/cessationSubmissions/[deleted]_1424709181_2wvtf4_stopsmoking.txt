Today is the day.

I've been smoking for over 7 years. Recently I've been wanting to quit, but kept telling myself I needed better resources, tools, support, a better time to do it, etc. Anyways, I've met someone who DESPISES smoking. When I dropped her off last night I told her to throe away my brand new pack of cigarettes. She said she'd help me. I want to do it for myself, her, my family, and the future. I know it's going to be rough, and I plan on using this as a great support system. Here's to a smoke free tomorrow, and many after that!

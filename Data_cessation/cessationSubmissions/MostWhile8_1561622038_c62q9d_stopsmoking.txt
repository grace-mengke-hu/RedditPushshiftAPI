I want to quit so bad

I got addicted to the stupid juul late into my senior year in high school so i’ve been using it for about a year and a half. I started out of spite for an ex and my own shitty mental health and I can’t seem to stop. My use of it just slowly went up until I could easily clear a pod in one day. I always feel dumb about it because it’s almost a trend for high schoolers to get addicted and how normalized it is but now with my current SO, he’s really been pushing me to stop.  My asshole of a father also supplies me because in my state it’s over 21 but I am 19. I was working down to slowly quitting to until I came home and he would just give them to me. I want to do this for myself and everyone around me. My SO has dealt with it, but wants me to quit. My mother was a heavy smoker for most of her life and when she found out she cried because she didn’t want me to have that crutch that she did for so long. So let’s see if I can do this and any tips would be greatly appreciated. Also, I am very sorry for the long rant I just needed to get it out.

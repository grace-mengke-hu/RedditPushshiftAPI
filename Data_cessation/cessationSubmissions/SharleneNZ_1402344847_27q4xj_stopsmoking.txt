Day one, but kind of a different quit.

So my husband is on day 5 of quitting cold turkey.  I have wanted to give up for a long time, but having him smoke around me was just making me feel murderous.

Last night, I went and flushed the rest of my packet, knowing that if there were no cigarettes, I wouldn't end up having one.  So I put my patch on before bed last night, now it's the morning and I haven't felt homicidal...yet haha!  I should add that I'm also quitting a daily cannabis habit today also.  I know it's not the best idea, but I need some drastic action so my husband doesn't leave me....long story.

Husband doesn't know I'm not smoking, nor that I flushed the rest of the packet.  Not planning on telling him, because it will probably make him even more irritable....so yeah, day one!

Edit:  I should add that husband doesn't believe I can ever quit and says he is only giving up because he can't afford to anymore because of me.  Hence the reason for not telling him about it.

Update:  Husband came home with a brand new pack.  I told him that he just wasted his money because I hadn't had a cig since the night before.  I didn't want to say anything, but I kind of had too because I wanted to return the cigs and get the money back (we are friends with the shopkeeper).  I did get the money, then went and bought my children some new shoes and we had pizza for dinner :)  I feel relieved that it's out in the open.

I’m currently smoking my last one then off to shower and work.

Tomorrow is my 41st Birthday too. I’ve quit a million times and it’s the habit that always brings me back not necessarily the cravings.  I’ve tried everything out there to quit but this time I’m going cold turkey. I have gum, tons of water, hard candies, crochet skills and a love of jigsaw puzzles that will hopefully keep my mind and fingers busy. My car is my weakness, driving to work, lunch break, basically if I’m in my car I would be smoking. 
It killed my Mom at 41 (heart attack), took my Dad in his late 50’s (cancer) and I pray to God I can stop it from killing me too. Plus I stink, my face is starting to shows wrinkles and my hair is always dry and smoky smelling. Enough is enough!

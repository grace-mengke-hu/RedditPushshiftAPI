Fighting my triggers

I was a 30+ year smoker who quit on 11/15/12 (Great American Smokeout) and things have gotten progressively easier every day. However, there are still triggers that make the cravings harder to ignore. The big one is driving. I got so used to lighting up every time I got in my car that it's a struggle to not drive angry. I've been using Nicorette lozenges or the occasional e-cig and am finding they are great for satisfying the nicotine cravings, but that means nothing when I have a behavioral habit to break! Has anyone found a great way to cope with the urge to smoke while driving? I sometimes snap my wrist with a rubber band, but I don't always have one on me. All input appreciated!

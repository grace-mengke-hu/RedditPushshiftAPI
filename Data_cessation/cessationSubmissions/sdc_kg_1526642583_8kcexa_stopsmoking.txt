On day one again, but with a different mindset.

I was doing NRT (lozenges) to quit.  I *did* quit, with patches, for 7 years a while back.  But I slip often.  I have a lozenge, spit it out, smoke, then pop a lozenge again.  It's been happening more and more often, and it's only making life worse.  Now, I get anxious unless I have a steady supply of nicotine, all day.  I'm just on the edge of being a chain-smoker on the weekends.  I've kinda dug myself deeper into the nicotine-addiction hole while trying to claw out of it.  So..  I'm done.

I have a stack of Allen Carr books.  I've read them.  I'm on EasyWay ths morning.  You can't get off heroin by shooting more heroin.  Nicotine?  It's been real.  Alcohol?  Ciao.  I'm done, today.

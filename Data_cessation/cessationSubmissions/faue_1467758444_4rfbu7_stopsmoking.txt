Birthday present to myself

Tomorrow I turn 26. It will be the 8th anniversary of my first cigarette. I've decided to give myself a gift this year, the gift of freedom from cigarettes. Freedom from going into work worried whether my coworkers can smell it on me, from the cost of them that would be better put to use in a retirement account, freedom from bad sleep and from burning lungs when I try to run more than a quarter mile. This isn't my first attempt, but it will be my last.

You're all an inspiration, thank you and keep it up!

Could you walk me through your first day?

I'm a 10 years smoker, I ran out of smoke last night, and didn't buy a pack today yet. I've been thinking about quitting for sometime and I don't know if I could go through it. 

I have so much work and can't afford to be angry, what do you think?

Edit: Thanks to all of you for replying. 
On an update, I couldn't just cut the smoking, so around 11:00 am, I bought a pack, and smoked one, then by 2:00 I smoked another, usually by now (4:00 pm here) I would've smoked 8 cigarettes. 

My goal now is to drop from 15 cigarettes a day to 0 in a week. I'll keep you updated.

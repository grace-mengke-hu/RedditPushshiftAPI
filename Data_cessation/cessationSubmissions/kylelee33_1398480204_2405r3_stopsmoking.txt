Regarding Anxiety

I've read numerous posts on here about the severe anxiety that happens after quitting. I've dealt with anxiety my whole life, the worst of which has been happening the past few years. 

I'm on day 5 of quitting, and starting on day one, my anxiety has been almost nonexistent. I've been more confident, more talkative at work and social situations, and more open with my girlfriend. I was so worried that quitting would turn me into an antisocial dunce, but the opposite has happened.

Can anyone else relate? The only conclusion I can come to is that the cigarettes have been contributing to the severity of my anxiety.

Is anyone else out there a "casual smoker" who keeps himself in a mild state of constant withdrawal?

My smoking history isn't as cut and dry as some, but I know I'm a "smoker" regardless, probably with some to-the-grave urges.

16: started smoking while in a foreign exchange program in Spain.

17 - 18: three cigarettes a day, every day, more on weekends, hanging out with friends, drinking coffee at IHOP (heh.) 

18 - 20: Half a pack a day in college, cigarettes between classes, more on weekends and at parties, increased during finals.

20 - 22: quit smoking completely 

23 - 26: Back in Spain with its big smoking culture, smoke on weekends, buy packs when I drink, feel urges pretty strongly on Monday and Tuesday but ignore them.


For these past few years I've been doing this weekend smoking thing, but I think it's still a full blown addiction manifesting itself through these binges and purges of nicotine instead of the steady draw.  Is anyone else out there like that?  I haven't had a full cigarette now for about a week and a half (had a few drags of a friends about 5 nights ago) but these milestones won't have a big effect on me because I'm no longer daily.  Has anyone else tried to walk the balance of occasional smoker?  I don't think it's even really possible, especially for those of us who've been regular smokers before.  I'm sick of the mild anxiety and withdrawal symptoms that come with weekend cigarettes, I think it's probably time to cut myself off for good.  I want to do more exercise, ride my bike farther, etc, avoid the tunnel vision/brain scramble that comes with missing that weekly dose of nicotine. 

Has anyone else had a similar smoking history?

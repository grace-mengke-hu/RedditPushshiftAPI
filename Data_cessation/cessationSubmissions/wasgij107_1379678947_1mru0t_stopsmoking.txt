I have been dying for a cigarette.

The ONLY thing that has stopped me so far is the idea that I 'only want one.' And I will not go buy a pack for 'only one.' And nobody I know/see regularly will let me have a cigarette. It makes it worse that the people I am closest too smoke MY KINDA cigarette. Ugh, I am trying like hell to keep my mind in other places.

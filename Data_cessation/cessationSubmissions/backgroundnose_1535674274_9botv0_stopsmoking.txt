Reasons

These are the reasons why I don't want to smoke:

1.  It's a health risk and I love life. I believe I can make a valuable contribution to the planet and those around me if I am healthy.
2. It affects my self-image. I do not like needing anything external to relax/destress. I get cognitive dissonance if I do it as I know it is bad for me and this gives rise to tension within me.
3. It is bad for my appearance. It stains my teeth and lips. It slows down healing and accelerates the signs of ageing including skin tone and grey hair.
4. It is costly. I am working to get the stress free life I deserve and part of this is being more in control of my finances.
5. I do not want to support the tobacco industry. It is another way I can make an impact as a consumer.

That's all for know. I think I have been in denial for so long about how bad I was feeling about this filthy habit.

I'm going to take this more seriously this time and finally be free! I know I can do it.

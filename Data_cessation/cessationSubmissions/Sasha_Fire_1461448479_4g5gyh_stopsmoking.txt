Handling the mental side of quitting

I'm on day 9 and not having physical cravings anymore, I know everything is just mental at this point and trying my best to handle it. My friend who quit 3 years ago gave me a great pep talk about talking to myself when I get a mental craving, saying things like: Why would I pay to poison myself? I am not even relaxing when I smoke, I have to go get the cigarettes then I have to smoke them and feel myself get more tired, wheezy, stinky etc. 

I will admit when she say's this stuff I feel a surge of fuck smoking and I totally wanna quit forever. Then my sneaky smoker mind is like, just one or coffee/driving/talking to this person means I should smoke and how nice that would be. I smell it when I run errands and it smells good still, she keeps telling me one day it will stink and gross me out; that day can't come soon enough. 

I know I'm going strong, it's midday of day 9 now, this is longest I haven't smoked in years since my last time quitting. I know I never wanna quit again because this has been complete torture, I guess some suggestions or reinforcements on how to handle the mental side of quitting would be helpful right now.

I'm really glad this sub exists.

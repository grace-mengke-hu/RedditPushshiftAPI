When do the cravings stop...

I'm 90 days in. The last 2 weeks i've been craving cigarettes everyday. They're not particularly intense cravings but they're not as easy to shift as after the first couple of weeks of quitting. They last a long time too, like 10 minutes at least. I get easily triggered by seeing images of cigarettes. When will the cravings finally go completely.

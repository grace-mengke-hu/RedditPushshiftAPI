Attitude seems to be everything...

I'm half way through day 3 of my second genuine quit attempt. I'm realizing my attitude has EVERYTHING to do with how successful I want to be with this. My first bout was around 6 months ago. I made it 40ish days and had the WORST attitude about it. I was a total f'ing beast. I didn't want to quit. I did it because I SHOULD and it's the 'right thing to do.' This time I feel totally different. I woke up this past weekend with a wicked cigarette hangover from a night out and was already craving another one as I hacked up garbage from my lungs. I smelled like shit and felt like shit. The switch flipped and I was decided I'm all set. I finished out the weekend and most of Monday smoking. Monday night I smoked my last one and ripped up the remaining ones and tossed em out and literally said 'It's been fun but I'm all set with you guys.' 

I threw a patch on the next morning and thus far it's been 100x easier than the last time I quit because I wake up with a pretty fucking awesome attitude about it. I literally talk to myself when I get hit with a craving and say 'Ciggarettes are gross. You smoked for 15 years. You had your fun. You are NOT a smoker any more' That an a lot of cinnamon gum! 

I plan on taking the patch off after 2-3 weeks. After the whole hand to mouth craving goes away. I did it last time no problem but like I said, total shit attitude about it. If you don't genuinely want it bad enough it's not gonna happen. I hope everyone who's smoking eventually feels the switch flip. It's a really cool feeling. Anyways, good luck everyone and keep on pushin. Keep those attitudes up and up!

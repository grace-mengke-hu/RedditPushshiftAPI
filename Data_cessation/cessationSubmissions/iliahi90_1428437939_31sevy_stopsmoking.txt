Anxiety is getting bad and I am afraid I'll cave

I go see my doctor tomorrow for some pain I've been having in chest (not my lungs). I have anxiety and I'm afraid I may have something seriously wrong with me. I know I'm getting ahead of myself, so I'm trying to calm down. I usually smoke to ease the anxiety. ..please help...

Almost two weeks

Hi
 Been lurking here around. Reading all the stories is Very inspiring . Now iT is time to post something myself.

I smoked my last cigarette almost two weeks ago. I smoked around two Packs of cigarettes each single day. Sometimes more but never less. I was in despair. Hated the whole thing. Hated the pure annihilation of freedom that smoking is. 

I went to the doc and she prescribed me nicotine tablets. This helps me overcome the physical addiction. I also use the smoke Free app which monitors my progress and gives a lot of tips.. I made a relapseprevention plan. I do mindfulness. I try to stay relax and not to make quitting an obsession. I focus on this day. Tomorrow Will care for itself.

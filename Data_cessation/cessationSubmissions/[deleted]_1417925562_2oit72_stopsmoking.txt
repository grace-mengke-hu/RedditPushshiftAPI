Holy shit I'm finally joining you guys!

Eleven damn years. Eleven! Almost half my damn life. Who knows how much money wasted. I feel so sick and weak and STUPID.

Well, no more! I'm a conscious, rational non smoker and I'm so excited for my anxiety and depression and breathing and energy and STRENGTH to improve. 

No willpower, just facts. No moping, just elation. Freedom is sweet. I love you all. You're powerful and worth it.

The real test

Hey guys,

So, I've finally pulled the trigger and threw al my cigs, lighters and ashtrays out. Been clean for 20 hours and feel great.

Even enjoying my morning coffee without smoking. Now the real test is comming up ahead, so I'm writing this to encourage myself. I need to head to the office and my co worker is a heavy smoker and drinker.. Already stopped with the alcohol and now I have to go and tell him that I quitted.

Hopefully the cravings will stay manageable.

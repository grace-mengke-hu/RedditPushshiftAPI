42 days is my old record, but this time feels like the real thing

Hey r/stopsmoking,

I've made it through the first month, and it's largely due to this subreddit.  I usually lurk here, but today I thought I'd share a few tips for quitting that I've experienced in my 2+ year battle to stop smoking.

1.  **Don't give up just because you've caved before.**  I know you guys know how it feels to quit over and over again, but forgive yourself and try to move forward with quitting.  The exact method that works best for you will probably differ from other quitters, so experimenting is going to involve some failing in order to learn.

2.  **Accept that you will never be a smoker again.**  In my opinion, this was the hardest part for my first few weeks, and the reason I failed during my last attempt to quit.  You really have to commit to being done mentally.

3.  **Get yourself in a good mental place before you try to quit.**  If you try to quit before a really stressful period of time (exams, family gatherings, financial hardships), it's probably not going to work.  You really need to be in a good mental place before you quit, meaning, if you're depressed or anxious you're going to seriously struggle.  Take care of your brain first.

I could probably keep going, but those are the main points that I wanted to get across.  Thanks for being a great subreddit!

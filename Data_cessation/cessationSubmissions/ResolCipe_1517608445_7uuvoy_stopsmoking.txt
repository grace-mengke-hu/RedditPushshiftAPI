Getting cranky

How do you deal with being argumentative and irritable with people who don't understand or care to understand what a nic fit is...

My kids are both too young to understand and my wife was one of those smokers who was able to just simply put it down and walk away. "It's so easy" she'd tell me. It'll be 24 hours in about 30 mins and it would be so easy for me to walk across the street and get a pack. I'm clawing the walls. Work is worse bc I work at a convenient store. I'm grumpy, pissy, and everything is annoying me. How do I calm myself down and put things into perspective before I start a needless argument.

Also the only reason I'm trying to quit isn't for health reason or bc it's bad for you. It's for financial reasons as well as to stop my wife from complaining that I stink. So there is no alore to quitting for me. It's not for me and I really don't want to. It's more so out of obligation which makes this so much harder in my eyes.

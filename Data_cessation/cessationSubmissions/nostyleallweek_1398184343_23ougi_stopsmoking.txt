Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking

So I picked this book up already well past my quit date while on the patches, and I have to say his book makes SO MUCH GODDAMN SENSE I kind of feel dumb for not making the connections he does.  That said, he advises that you keep smoking (or basically whatever your default behavior is) all the way through the book, which for me is using the patches.  In almost the same breath, he decries things like nicotine gum and patches as the equivalent of telling a heroin smoker to just inject it instead, which obviously is dumb, wrong, and not addressing the addiction.

What're your thoughts about quitting the patches immediately vs. completing the 10-week program (about 6 weeks in now, due to step down to 14mg patches in the next day or so)?

Do the cravings ever go away?

I've been cigarette free for 1 year, 180 days, 17 hours, 31 minutes, and 31 seconds as of this writing.  Having children was my primary motivation for quitting.  I don't think I'm ever going to relapse, but I still think about it constantly and sometimes the cravings continue to be pretty strong.  To the people that have quit for several years: will the cravings ever go away?  Or is this just something I need to cope with forever?  I'm willing to cope (I have so far, after all), but I'd prefer for the cravings to go away altogether, of course.  Thanks for any insight!

EDIT: I don't want this to discourage anyone.  Yeah, I still have cravings, but I think I'm a worst-case scenario and the cravings I do have, while occasionally strong, don't approach anywhere *near* the level of intensity as the cravings I had toward the beginning.  Also, there have been many *tremendous* benefits to quitting or I wouldn't have lasted this long!

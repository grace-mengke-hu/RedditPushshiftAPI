First reddit post EVER. Quitting with aid of wellbutrin.

I do so badly want to quit. I have been using wellbutrin as a smoking cessation pill over Chantix I for over a month now. But I still get cravings. I have a third of a cigarette every morning and evening since being on wellbutrin (including thus morning)  but after seeing this subreddit I will throw away my pack in my car for traditional after work cig and start really going cold turkey. It was a boon to find this sub and to hear all the others out there going through what I am going through.

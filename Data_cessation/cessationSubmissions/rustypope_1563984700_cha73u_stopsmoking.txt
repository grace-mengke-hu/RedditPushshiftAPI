Today marks 3 years!

It's that time of year again, where I post my stop smoking anniversary. This date is 3 years exactly. I'm posting so all who are struggling and think today is the day to cave, please know that you can do it! Keep pushing, keep focused. If I can do it, you can too. I smoked for 22 years and it's been great to put all of that behind me. I applaud everyone who undertakes this journey because it is not easy. Know that you are supported!

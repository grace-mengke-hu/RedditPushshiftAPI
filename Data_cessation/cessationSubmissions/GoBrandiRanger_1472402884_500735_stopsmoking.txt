Advice on tactics to help

Hey guys and gals, I have posted a few comments but this is my first self post in the sub.

I have to say, when I'm questioning quitting, coming here and reading some stories helps strengthen my resolve so much more.

I have a few questions for the collective knowledge machine, though. A quick history: smoker for 13 years, pack a day for the last 6 years. I'm using the patch to help me quit. 

This is my first time really, honestly making an attempt to quit. I have 3 toddlers who I am their main caregiver because my husband works odd hours so I obviously can't take any time away to myself to cope. 

My main question here is what I can do to make it through my fatigue and smokers flu stage. I feel absolutely awful. I didn't think this would happen using the patch, which is why I decided to use it, but here I am feeling terrible and in a dense fog. Kind of ironic to feel fog in my brain when I've cleared the smoke from my life...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I'm currently on day 3

Edit 2: thanks, Reddit. As usual, you were a big help...

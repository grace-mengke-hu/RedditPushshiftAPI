Just finished day 3. Here's my tips to get through those first 3 days:

So I wasn't a long time smoker, but I was a VERY heavy smoker. We are talking 3ish packs a day. I just made it through my 3rd day cig free after 3 years of heavy smoking, and figured I'd share a couple of very humble tips (I haven't made it yet, but I'm close)

1. Allen Carr really is a genius. If you are on your 3rd or 4th quit attempt and just can't get over the hump, read that damn book.
2. The patch, or gum, or whatever you decide to use if you use NRT takes the edge off, but don't expect to not have cravings or to feel even remotely ok. 
3. 90% of what you are feeling is in your head. Try to separate the mental from the physical. The physical withdrawals suck, but they are not nearly as bad as your brain is telling you they are. 
4. A swig of ice cold water through a straw will do wonders in the midst of a craving.  
5. Cigs will never give you anything you can't get somewhere 1000x healthier. You want to relieve stress? Work out, have a beer (but no more than one), relax and watch some TV, do anything else. Cigs seem like the only way now, but in reality, they are the worst way. 
6. And finally, when you think about caving, don't think in terms of one cig, think of it in terms of the chain reaction of future cigs that are sure to come from that one. You aren't smoking one when you cave, you are smoking 1,000 more.

I hope I could help anyone in the midst of quitting. It sucks so bad. But for me, the cravings have peaked after 3 days. The struggle certainly isn't over, but I feel so much better already. I hope all of you never take another puff.

Easyway stopped working. I don't know what to do.

I used to smoke for 6 years. Then I read Easyway and stopped for 2 years. Then stopped again, using the same method, haven't smoked for almost a year. Now I got back again. One cigarette was enough to put me into addiction one more time.   
The problem is that Easyway somehow stopped working on me and I don't know what I should do. It seems that I don't get something what is written there or I miss the point. Or - there are some facts I subconsciously don't want to understand.   


I am young, but seriously sick (heart problems/serious metabolic disorders) and I can't afford smoking. I basically don't have money to buy myself a gym card because I spent too much on cigarettes (I smoke 0.5-pack a day). I remember times when I wasn't smoking and everything felt so good.   


Any tips? Experience? I know that no one is a hard case but I'm starting to think that I am.

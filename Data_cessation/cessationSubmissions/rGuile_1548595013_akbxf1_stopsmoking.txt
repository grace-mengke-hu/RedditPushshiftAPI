Break-Up, Relocation &amp; Cravings

I upended my life in a career change that's taking me to a different state, due in part because of a relationship situation that needed some changing. Going through an "amicable" breakup if that's really ever possible, I'm masking the sadness with excitement of setting forth and starting new somewhere else. 

I've stayed quit for somewhere in the ballpark of a year and a half, and after the withdrawal's subsided, the  cravings have never been this strong. Im resolute to never smoke again, and the smell of other people smoking makes me gag, but I can see how my mind is playing ticks on me with a strange nostalgia for nicotine. 

Fuck Cigs.

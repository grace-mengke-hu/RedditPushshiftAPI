Avoiding cigs on holiday and when out

Hi guys,

Am on Day 23, but haven't gone out drinking or gone on holiday abroad yet - both of those have caused me to slip up in the past because I'm out of my daily routine and mentally I think it doesn't matter because it's not the real world. Of course the cigarettes then always follow me back into the real world - how do I go about avoiding cigarettes in this world of escapism when my willpower isn't quite the same?

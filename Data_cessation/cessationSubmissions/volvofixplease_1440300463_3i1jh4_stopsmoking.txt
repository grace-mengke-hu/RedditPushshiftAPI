I just figured out something beautiful.

This will be my 12 or 13th time to stop smoking and most of my attempts failed at the two to three week mark and now I finally know why...
Previously I would get a pang and I would start to romanticize one cigarette just one more and in the end i would end up smoking it and end up hooked again BUT what I never realised is that i truly am a non smoker and that I truly never enjoyed a cigarette at any time,what i suffered was the illusion of pleasure gained when I abstained for a certain period of time and then relieved my withdrawal pang...Just imagine how v aluable that cigarette was for me but the thing is AS SOON AS YOU ESTINGUISH YOUR LAST CIGARETTE YOU ARE A NON SMOKER AND YOU DONT NEED TO RELIEVE YOUR WITHDRAWAL PANGS ANYMORE STOP MOPING FOR A ILLUSION WHETHER YOU QUIT FOR A DAY OR 1000 DAYS becouse you have nothing to really gain from it,only the misery of having to start the whole fucking ordeal again FOR NOTHING BUT THE ILLUSION OF PLEASURE FROM SUPPLYING FRESH NICOTINE INTO YOUR BODY.This is it you guys,I had my last cigarette ten minutes ago but i really feel it this time im done forever and so you can be :D

Has anyone experience Insomnia while they used the patches and weened their intake down?

Hi,

So I have been weening off cigarettes, I went from a pack a day to a pack every 3 or 4 days while on the patch.

I know that kind of defeats the purpose of trying to quit while using the patch however I am taking this time to deal with replacing the triggers. I drive all over for work and one of the biggest triggers I had was to smoke inbetween stops and I have actually killed that off, leave the pack at home and then have a mint whenever I get a craving and the patch helps regulate my mood(ie road rage)

So I have still been smoking and using the patch and I started with the 14mg patches and things seemed decent while I was still smoking, I decided to try going 24 hours without a cigarette and I used the 21mg patch and I was successful however since using the 21mg patch I have had not been able to get a full nights sleep for the life of me and often lay awake until 2 or 3am.

I drink ALOT of coffee and I heard smoker metabolize coffee better than non-smokers so when not reducing your coffee intake while trying to quit can actually make the caffeine more effective.

Has anyone else had crazy trouble sleeping while trying to quit?

TL;DR Weening off cigarettes, using the patch and still smoking, was fine with 14mg patch, kicked up to 21mg to try and go completely smoke free and I am having trouble falling asleep

Am I

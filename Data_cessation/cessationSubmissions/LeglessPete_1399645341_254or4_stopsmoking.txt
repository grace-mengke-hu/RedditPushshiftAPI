Today's the day, could use some beginner help

It's Mother's Day soon and I figured nothing would make that woman happier than if I quit smoking, but honestly I'm terrified. I've been wanting to quit for a while but I can hardly go five hours without nearly murdering my entire household. I'm just so sick of the constant coughing and heaviness in my chest. Does anybody have some useful tips? Or maybe helpful free apps? I would be very grateful for any help you wonderful people could give me. I am one half hour into my journey.

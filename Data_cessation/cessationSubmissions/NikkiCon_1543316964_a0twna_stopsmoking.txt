I quit smoking but now can't breathe?!

I had my last cig 17 days ago and I'm happy. No cravings really, it was the first few days that were the worst. My next hurdle will be when I go for drinks with friends. That will be the real test -to not smoke when I'm drinking. 

My only problem is I've been having a difficult time breathing. I cannot take a full breath. My lungs just aren't filling fully! I am not coughing up phlegm and my lungs haven't done a clear out as such. I have no cough or cold, all of that is fine. I'm not feeling light headed or unwell and I'm in no pain, the only thing wrong is that I can't take a full breath! 

Has anyone ever experienced this? It's freaking me out!!

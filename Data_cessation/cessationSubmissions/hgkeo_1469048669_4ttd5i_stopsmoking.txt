100 days gone, and not a single thought of cigarettes on my mind. Content, satisfied without smoking.

When I was early in to my quit, I didn't think I would ever see this day, that I would be satisfied and not smoking. Reading other success stories on this sub totally helped, and I hope this helps others to stay quit too. 

I know it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you've just quit, but as someone on the other side, I can tell you that it exists. And you will feel better than you ever have when you're done.

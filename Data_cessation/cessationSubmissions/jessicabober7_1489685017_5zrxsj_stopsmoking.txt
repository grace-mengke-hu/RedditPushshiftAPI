Do I love being a non smoker? Yes. I do.

It's one of my mantras. I would say 80% of the time I do love it, but you know how hard-hitting and aggressive that other 20% - the addict - can be. I have my moments where all I can think of is having a smoke, it's a consuming 30 seconds or so. But I haven't caved and I don't plan on it. I love being able to taste and smell so much! I can breathe a little easier. My lungs are healing and cleaning out all the gunk. It used to be so gross when I would cough constantly and sneeze up brown goo, now I'm pretty delighted when I occasionally (not all day long) cough up gunk, it means my body is doing the dirty work and healing itself. I know I'm still pretty early on but I feel really great about my progress. I hope everyone else is feeling good too!

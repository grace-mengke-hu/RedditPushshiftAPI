Just quit smoking this morning!

I've been smoking about 6-7 per day for 2 1/2 years. Things aren't as bad as they could be, but after getting my mental health in order I decided smoking just isn't worth it. 

I picked it up while hanging around a friend group where every person smoked. Peer pressure isnt always what people say it is. Sometimes you feel the pull to be like the group without anyone pressuring you personally, but the social pressure of being the only one that doesnt can snatch you if you dont recognize it. I foolishly thought I wouldn't get addicted, but after the first 3 months I couldn't stop.

I grew up seeing all but 1 of my grandparents die from smoking-related diseases and I used to take that very seriously before I battled with suicide ideation for years. When that started up, I had the mindset that the worst that could happen is that it's kill me faster, which sadly was more of a pro for me at the time. 

I'm proud to say now that I value my life and want to take control of my health while I'm still young and am capable of turning this around. I'm only a few hours into quitting, but I'm determined to stay committed to recovery! 

I've decided to quit cold turkey, if anyone else has gone this route, any tips for when the itch starts?

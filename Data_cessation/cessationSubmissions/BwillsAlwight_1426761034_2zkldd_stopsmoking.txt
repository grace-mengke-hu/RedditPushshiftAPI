On my third day...

...I'm feeling great, really optimistic and just generally in great spirits! I can already smell better and breath deeper. I'm also so glad that i found this subreddit, simply lurking here and reading others experiences has given me great insight and instilled a sense of direction in me that i did not have previously. Time to keep breathing that fresh air!   

Thanks everyone!

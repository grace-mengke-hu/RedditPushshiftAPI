Best strategies for post acute withdrawal symptoms?

I made the switch to mostly vaping and occasional nicotine gum a couple years ago, and while I had a murky vision of ultimately quitting nicotine entirely, my harm reduction rationalizations allowed me to kick the idea of quitting down the line for far too long. Anyways, I've been off the shit for plenty long that it's out of my system, and now I'm at the point where my mind is telling me I want that nic hit back. What strategies do y'all use to get past these intrusive thoughts and desires.

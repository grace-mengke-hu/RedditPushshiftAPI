smoking weed

what do you guys think of smoking weed, in general and while quitting cigarettes? obviously smoking in general damages your lungs, but weed is something I am not addicted to and actually enjoy once in a while. do you think smoking weed is fine while quitting, or does it maybe bring back addictive patterns like lighting up and inhaling that could take you back to cigarettes?

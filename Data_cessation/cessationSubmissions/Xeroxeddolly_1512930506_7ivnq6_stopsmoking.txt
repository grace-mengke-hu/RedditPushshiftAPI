So I didn't really believe deep breaths could help me until now.

Although so many on here say take deep breaths, breathe deeply etc., although it's certainly supportive and appreciated advice, I did not actually buy into it being able to help me, until now.  
Now that I understand PROPER breathing techniques.  Here's a link to one of my favorite guys on youtube, motivational doc talking about proper diaphragm breathing and how it helps so much with so many things.  This guys is awesome btw:

and then I saw in the comments someone learning the 4-8-7 breathing technique, so I got curious and looked into.  I like this, because it also keeps the mind busy and focused on something. There's a few other breathing techniques in this page too:

I hope this helps everyone, especially the non-believers like how I was lol :P

No offense to anyone who recommends this, but initially I was like "deep breaths?  that won't help me get through this at all!" lol  I've been enlightened! &lt;3

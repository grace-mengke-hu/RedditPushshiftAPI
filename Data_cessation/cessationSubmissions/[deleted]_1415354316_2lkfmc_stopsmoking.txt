I still stink.

I quit tobacco on October 14, but I still smell bad. Yesterday my wife and I went to the OB/GYN for a checkup on her and our baby (due 4/15!). My wife quit smoking as soon as we found out we were pregnant, but it took me a while longer, because I'm nowhere near as tough as she is.

The young doc had barely started examining my wife before she started with "Which one of you is the cigarette smoker?" It was really frustrating because it's been so hard on both of us. I haven't detailed the car since I quit and the clothes I was wearing only had 3 or 4 laundry cycles since my last smoke, but I might as well have been puffing on the way to the office.

I explained my quit day and how amazing my wife had been in quitting, but I still got a speech about how smoking is bad for the fetus. Over five months out, and I already felt like a bad parent.

It was a frustrating reminder of how bad the smell of tobacco is to most folks.

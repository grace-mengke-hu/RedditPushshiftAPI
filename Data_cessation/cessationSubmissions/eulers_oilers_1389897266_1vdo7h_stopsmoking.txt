Any way to help friends stop smoking?

A couple of my close friends have been smoking for the past few years.  They keep saying that they want to quit, but nothing ever comes of it.  Their new years resolution was to stop smoking, but a day or so later (not sure if they ever really did stop) they were back at it.  I understand that they have to want to stop for themselves, but is there anything I can do to help?

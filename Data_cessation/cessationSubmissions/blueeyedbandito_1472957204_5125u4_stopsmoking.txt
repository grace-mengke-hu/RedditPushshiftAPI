Day 1 - 22 year old, addicted to Nicotine since I was 15

Hey guys,

Today is my first day quitting nicotine again. I quit for about 6 months this year, then picked it back up for a few months. I'm ready to quit again.

I just started a new, high pressure job. I also am in the process of moving among other stressful things . However, I'm not too worried. Confident I can power through it. I also realize that there will likely never be a 'perfect' time to quit.

I was a former smoker, then an e cig user, and for the past month I've been eating nicotine lozenges like candy. I'm ready to just free myself from this annoying addiction. 

Otherwise, things in my life are pretty solid and I'm in a good place. So, quitting nicotine would be awesome. I'm a little nervous about weight gain, but I generally eat very healthy and wouldn't freak out over a few pounds here and there.

Thanks for reading and best of luck to y'all.

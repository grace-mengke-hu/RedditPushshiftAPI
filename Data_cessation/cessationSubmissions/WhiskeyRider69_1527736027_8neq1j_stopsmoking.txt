Survived the day

I struggled pretty hard all day long today for some reason. Although I never managed to figure out why, I did manage to make it all day without using any form of nicotine. Hopefully tomorrow will be better. 

There were a number of times today that I walked out to my car and stood at the trunk, reading Reddit and listening to the voice in my head rationalize why it was fine for me to grab a nicotine lozenge. 

I told myself that the instructions on the lozenges laid out a 12 week program and I was only in week 9, so it was perfectly legit for me to use one to get through a bad craving. Man, I'm good at laying out rational arguments when I want something and apparently my subconscious mind has that ability too. üòÅ

I kept reminding myself that if I gave in, it wasn't going to do anything but strengthen my addiction and drag things out longer. I reminded myself that I am nicotine free now, so it doesn't make sense to put that nicotine back in my body. 

Those arguments helped, but what helped more than anything was hearing from you guys. If it weren't for this sub, I have no doubt that I would have caved today and used nicotine. Thanks to you guys, it is now bedtime and I'm still nicotine free. Thank you all. 

As an aside, after dinner I heated up a mug of chicken broth and sat on the couch watching TV and sipping on it. Chicken broth for me through some rough days in the first month, and it apparently still has the same effect. By the time I was done with my mug, I felt a lot better. 

Thanks again quitters, you guys rock.

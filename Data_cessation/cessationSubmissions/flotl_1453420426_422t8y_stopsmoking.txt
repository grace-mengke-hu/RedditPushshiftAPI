I just caved in and bought a pack again after a day of "quitting"..

I started smoking one cigarette and halfway through I hated myself and chucked the pack into the nearest trash bin. Don't need that shit anymore. I just hope I'll be able to retain that feeling of not even enjoying smoking anymore.

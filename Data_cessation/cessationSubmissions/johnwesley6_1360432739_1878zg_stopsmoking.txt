Chantix concerns

So I've tried every way to quit smoking and nothing has stuck. I've wanted to try chantix for a long time but because of everything I have read I have pretty much be to scared to try it. Everytime I talk myself up to try it I hop online and freak myself how. However I now have a couple of friends trying it all of them have positive results with no major side effects and that has me leaning to it now. Plus I have convinced myself that most of the people who post the horror stories on line were people who were already in some kind of bad mental shape in the first place. Now I just have to get the money for it

70 days!

Dude, I can't believe it's been 70 days. I can't believe how much my life has changed. 

My truck smells great, my clothes smell great, **I** smell great.

My heart rate is down along with my blood pressure. Nothing crazy, but I think all of the anxiety I was having about smoking, then smoking to calm down, then freaking out, was really starting to affect my health. So that's a great feeling. I run better now too.

My wallet is happy.

I'm happy.

**And because the numbers are the most sobering thing for me:** I've saved ~$420, and "missed out" on like 1400 cigarettes. 

Life is good everyone.

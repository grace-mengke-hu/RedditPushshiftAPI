Hey, finally

I've been smoking 14 years, started when I was 16. I've been lurking here for awhile and half-heartedly trying to quit for a couple weeks now. I started Wellbutrin about a week ago. I was supposed to give it ten days and try to quit, but I went to work without cigarettes yesterday and did fine. I wasn't really craving one until the very end of my shift, so I bummed one and it sucked. Got nothing from it.

So I guess I'm really doing this. I'm excited. I've always had trouble quitting in the past, because my anxiety ramps up so hard. Nicotine supplements make me jittery, and I'm just not going to vape. I wasn't really expecting the Wellbutrin to work out, but I'm glad I was wrong.

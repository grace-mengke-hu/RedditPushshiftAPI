I caved so I reset my badge.

I'm not gonna make excuses. I didn't trip and fall into a pack of cigarettes. I had a stressful day yesterday, so me and my GF went out to have a few drinks. I was sitting there and she said I even looked on edge. I told her "I'm pretty stressed about 'x,x,and y' and I kinda wanna smoke just to get it over with and it doesn't feel like 'forbidden fruit' anymore". She told me "I wasn't gonna tell you this but someone left a little less than half a pack on our windshield the other day." I was like "What!?" she said she was saving them for if I ever freaked out. Crazy! So I got drunk smoked some smokes and relaxed a little. Im not proud of smoking but I'm not ashamed either.I didn't start in a day so It's gonna take some practice to quit. I'm just gonna keep at it and not smoke because I don't want to not just "because I can't".

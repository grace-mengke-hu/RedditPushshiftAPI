Smoked my last one prior to writing this

Hello All,
I quit smoking for 2 months back in the fall and found reading this forum immensely helpful.
I am ready to quit for life.

Me: 38 and have been smoking from about the age of 20. I can easily smoke 40 cigarettes a day and often do. I am sick of the addiction, sick of the drag on my finances, sick of the stigma.
I am recently single and plan on dating again in 2-3 months. I want to do that as a non-smoker.

I just smoked my last cigarette prior to writing this â€“ it was a bland experience and my chest hurts. My fingers are yellow and my teeth are stained.

Next steps are a shower and good a tooth scrubbing.

I love seeing all your badges counting the days without smoking. I want one too!

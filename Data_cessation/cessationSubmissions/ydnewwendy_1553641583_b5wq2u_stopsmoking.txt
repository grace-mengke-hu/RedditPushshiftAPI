Today was tough

It’s been 8 days and I was so close to giving in.  
I was in the store saying things to myself like “who will know if I buy a pack and hide them in my car.....” 
Yesterday I actually looked underneath the seat of my car for a fallen soldier.....none
So......I still haven’t smoked
It makes me angry sometimes
It’s been my coping mechanism for a few years now and I really enjoyed smoking 
Hopefully I can keep this going

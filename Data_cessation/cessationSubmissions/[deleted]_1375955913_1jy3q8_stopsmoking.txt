Smoking again after reading Easyway :(

I felt so confident about quitting after reading the book. At the end of the book there's a chapter about how some people will start smoking again because they find it easy to stop by reading the book, but that mindset will just make you smoke, thinking that it will be easy to re-read the book again.

Now I'm hooked again and I don't feel ready to read the book again. This is such a contradiction, but have any of you read the book, quit, started smoking and then quit again by re-reading it? I feel very ashamed. I got very angry a few days after finishing the book and just had a smoke in a weak moment.

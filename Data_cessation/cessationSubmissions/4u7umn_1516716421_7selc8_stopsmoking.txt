What Was Your Bottom?

I've been trying to quit for about a year. When I smoke it is paired with so much self loathing that it has become one of the biggest contributing factors to my either depressed or anxious state. Yet I don't stop. When I'm with my partner, I smoke a vape obsessively not leading on to how much I smoke on my own time. We book trips together which I should be ecstatic about, but in the back of my mind I fear not being able to smoke. I read Allen Carr, more than once. I've tried the apps. I don't know what to do, I get so agitated and I never seem to make it beyond 10 days. Does anyone have any advice? What was your bottom?

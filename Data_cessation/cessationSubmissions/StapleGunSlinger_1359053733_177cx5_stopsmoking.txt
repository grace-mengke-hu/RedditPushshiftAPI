I knew this was going to be hard, but DAMN!

Hey everyone! I am in my mid 20’s and a female from the NE. I have been smoking ¾ a pack a day since I was 19 years old. Last night around 12:30 I put out my last cigarette! I have been thinking about quitting for a really long time, and on the way home from work when I would pick up another pack, I just kept on driving. I am sick of feeling sick all the time. I know smoking is one of the top, if not the number one reason why I feel like crap all the time. 

I usually wake up in the morning have a cigarette, and then go on with my morning activities before work. The second I get in the car I light up again. This all went really smoothly this morning without smoking. Now that it is lunch time I am DYING! All that I want to do is pick up a pack and get rid of the empty achy feeling I have right now. I am trying to hold strong, but I am not sure how long I can last like this. Does anyone have any quick fixes that they used that may help me?

The real test is when I get home. My boyfriend is also a heavy smoker, and he has yet to quit. I know that smell is going to pull me in. UHG… At least I feel good that I have a place where I can vent, and people understand what I am going through.

Attempting to finally quit for good...

I started out smoking cigs in college very rarely around October of last year, id have at most 3 a day and thought it was super manageable. I was easily able to skip days with no worry whatsoever and actually disliked cigs at the time but for some reason I kept smoking them. I vowed to quit once college let out for the entire summer however I seem to have gone the complete opposite way. My smoking has only increased and i'm starting to associate it with so many things that its scaring me that I may be getting too deep into nicotine addiction. Therefore I am going to quit today before it becomes even more unmanageable. I just finished my last pack about 15 minutes ago and am feeling very optimistic this time. Any tips on the first few days would be greatly appreciated as those seem to be the hardest for me.

A plug for "The book" (No, I don't receive anything for this, it just worked miracles for me)

I'm not here to screw with anyone's quitting methods. If it is working for you, then keep going. I just want to talk about how I quit the ciggs. I smoked 1-2 packs a day for 15 years. I read this book "Allen Carr's Easyway to stop smoking" and I threw out the pack, and never looked back. It's a 10 dollar book, and it does not use scare tactics. It uses reason and logic. You're even supposed to continue smoking while reading it. By the end you simply can't wait to quit. It sounds miraculous, and it feels like it, but it simply makes clear how you actually feel when you smoke, and you start to consciously feel that. I have no idea how many days it's been since I quit, probably around 4 years, but I have no reason to keep track of that. I didn't change anything either. when co workers go out for a smoke, I even go out for a "non-smoke" It smells terrible to me, but it's fun to get a 5 minute break. Seriously, it's the price of less than 2 packs of smokes. Please try it out. Worse case scenario, you are right where you are now.

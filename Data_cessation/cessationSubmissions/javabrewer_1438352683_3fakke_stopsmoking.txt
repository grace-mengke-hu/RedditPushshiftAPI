500 days and feeling awesome

500 days ago I quit smoking with the help of a vaporizer which I then quit after three months of successively lower nicotine concentration (24 to 18 to 12 to 6).  The withdrawl pangs were pretty hard at first which is why I chose to vape.  It also helped me out in social situations where the habit of smoking was very strong.  I pushed through it though and haven't had a cigarette since.  Now, the smell of smoke disgusts me and I look back at myself and wonder how I ever did it so long.  These days I'm back to exercising (shameless Brazilian jiu jitsu plug) and feeling stronger than ever.  The money I spent on cigs goes directly to my gym fees, and the time I spent smoking I now spend on the mat training.

And with that, if you're thinking about quitting, I'll leave [this little motivational video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHfVn_cfHU) to get you started.

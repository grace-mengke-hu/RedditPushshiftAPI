One week no smoking and it's a little tiny bit easier today

I've hit the one week mark! This is the first time I've made it this long despite multiple attempts at quitting. Days 4-6 were rough, especially 5. But, today is slightly easier. It's still pretty much all I think about but I don't actually want to go buy a pack. And my emotions are a little more level today. 

I know I'm not out of the woods yet but I'll celebrate any victory I have. Thanks to everyone on this sub for the motivation and support! :)

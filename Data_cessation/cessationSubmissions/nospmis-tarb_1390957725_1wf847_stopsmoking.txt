Reddit I need your advice, opinions or just someone to listen...because my mom is going to die if I don't do something and I don't know what else to do.

Warning: Long.

First English is not my first language so I'm sorry if any mistakes.

My mom is 52 years old, she smokes since she was 14, at least one pack a day. She as a pulmonary emphysema (I used a translator, I don't know if that what's called in English.) If she doesn't stop smoking she will die, but not before getting cancer or a tube in her throat and getting oxygen from a machine 24/7 to breathe. She has a history of depression (me too, I have cyclothymia)and she's very lonely so I know it's hard letting go of the one thing that keeps her sane but she's the most important person in my life and I don't want anything to happen to her, to make her suffer. The worst thing is she doesn't even show that she wants to stop. Recently I tried to make her smoke 11 cigarettes per day, because reducing is better than nothing but she can't even do that, and like with other drugs or vices she keeps having excuses. I smoke too, for 5/6 years now, 15 cigarettes a day so I reduced to 7/8 and I admit even for me is hard to quit. Maybe I sound hypocrite for wanting her to stop and smoking myself, but her case is much more worse, if I knew she would stop if I stopped I would but I know she won't (I know, I'm making excuses for myself). 
I've read Allen Carr, it didn't help me but I bought it for her and she didn't even read it.

What can I do??

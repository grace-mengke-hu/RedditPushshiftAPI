One Year Today

It has been 365 days without a smoke and what a trial it was.  

I am proud of myself.  

I am proud of all of you who have quit!  I am also proud of those of you who are in the process of quitting and those who are considering it!!!  It is worth the fight!  

Cheers and best of luck to each and everyone of us.

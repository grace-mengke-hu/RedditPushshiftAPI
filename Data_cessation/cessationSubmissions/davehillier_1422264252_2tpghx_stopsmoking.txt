3 weeks in!

3 weeks in from my last cigarette. Using an app called Smoke Free and can't recommend it enough.

Am cheating a bit by using patches but have gone from 20 a day for 14 years to 0. Started at 14 years old and stopped before for 8 months but this time I will make it permanent. Taken up running and gym again, I play squash twice a week so thought I was pretty fit, but after 2 weeks knocked off 10 minutes off 10k and can't belive the impact it's been having on my health.

I had a pretty bad cough before while smoking but this has become worse since stopping, not so much in the morning as this was the worse part while smoking but throughout the day...anyone else experienced this and have any feedback?

Have been quietly reading posts on here and thought I would finally join up to share my experience so far and wanted to say this forum has been invaluable to me in stopping and knowing that what I'm going through is shared by others and has helped support me over the last 3 weeks so thank you to you all!

This weekend I went to the shops and asked for 10 smokes and then said sorry no to the cashier and walked away, don't even know or understand why I was doing it...would have been so livid with myself but kept strong, also I'm putting the money im saving into a pot and after 3 weeks it's up to Â£147 and this has helped me as a visual and would recommend this myself.

Will my sleep go back to normal?

Hello there!

I an about 7 hours away from 96 hours of the smoke free life. 

Last night though when i went to sleep, I was exhausted but tossed and turned for a couple hours.

When I did finally pass out, it was only for about 5 hours. 

Weirdest shit in the world. Im assuming it gets better. But for now, i kinda take it as a victory. Getting all the crap out of my body!

Thanks!

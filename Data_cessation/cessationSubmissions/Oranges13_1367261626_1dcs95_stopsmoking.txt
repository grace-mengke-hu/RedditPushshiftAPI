My husband is quitting, and I want to help, but it isn't working

My husband is quitting smoking. He has switched to e-cigs and does not plan to stop using that, only the actual smokes. I am ok with that, its the actual tobacco I have an issue with.

I am trying to be encouraging as best as I can, but clearly I have never been a smoker so I do not understand. I have tried to be a good role model in other ways such as sticking to a diet, exercising regularly, etc. My hope is that he can see me forgoing things I want (ice cream, candy, etc) and use that as motivation for himself. He does not see it this way though.

I need advice. I want to be supportive, but I don't want to just turn the other cheek when he falls of the wagon either because I want him to know its important to me that he actually follow through. I have tried to be encouraging, to no avail. I have lost my patience, and he's "quit" more times than I can count. Every time I see him with a smoke or smell it on him I get upset, about 50% of the time I will mention it and usually end up angry.

The problem is that confrontation of this nature actually makes him MORE anxious and more likely to smoke again that day or in the future. He keeps buying packs, though he is only smoking one cigarette a week, sometimes less. To me, even having the pack means he *will* smoke it, but if I take it away, he'll just buy another out of spite and anger. He stands at the cross roads and makes the decision to buy another pack, and it frustrates me! He's better than this! He doesn't need the cigarettes to get over a bad day he needs to stop running from his problems!

He wants to do it his way or nothing. His way clearly isn't working and that angers me. He needs to just quit, but I don't know what to do so that he can see my point of view without getting all defensive about it :(

You're all quitting - how do you want your spouse to behave?

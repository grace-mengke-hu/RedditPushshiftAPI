The things I don't miss about smoking....

I don't miss...

- checking my pack to make sure I have enough cigs for the day.
- driving out of my way cuz the gas station over there has cheaper cigs.
- planning my day around my smoking - usually smoking while I plan my smoking.
- finding ways to get away from my kids as I didn't want them to see me smoke.
- when going out anywhere, first thing I would do is find the smoking area.
- hiding my smoking around non-smokers as I didn't want to hear about it from them. 
- standing in the rain trying to smoke as fast as possible because not smoking just isn't an option.
- standing in the snow......see above.
- thinking "I should really quit" with every cig.
- fast forwarding the stop smoking ads on tv.

And most of all, I don't miss being a slave to an addiction that gave me nothing in return. Well, except the possibility of major health problems and an empty bank account, it did give me that. 
Oh, and I really don't miss having to do the first quit day over and over and over with every relapse. Done with that too.

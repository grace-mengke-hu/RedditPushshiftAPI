Was easy to quit but hard to resist the "every once in a while" cravings

I've been free for almost 2 months now, at first the physical cravings were almost funny. I've been very stressed a lot of times in my life and I kinda enjoy the sensation; it keeps me motivated, this felt little different. After a day or so of quitting I felt no physical need for a cigarette, I could go on with my day without thinking much about it. After 3 days they didn't tempt me at all.

But after weeks I felt like I had such control that I knew "one smoke at a party" wouldn't hurt, and it didn't. And because it didn't hurt it gave me more confidence in the idea that "I can take one without getting physically addicted again" and that somehow triggered intense cravings that I haven't felt before at any time sicne I quit. The feeling is "I know I can control it and it's boring being free from its effects so why not do a single one to kill the boredom"

Anyone experienced something similar? Is this what gets people starting again after a while?

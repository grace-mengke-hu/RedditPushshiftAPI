Day 5... A lot of anxiety and a pain-ish kind of feeling in my body

Yesterday I had a lot of headache and dizziness now I still have them but in a lower rate in a way that it doesn't hurt much
But anxiety is Killin me
I decided to quit because I have a long break from my job and studying and everything basically...
But today I have this feeling of (incoming disaster)
And I don't know why
I know it's just dark thoughts and I'm over thinking everything 
but is cuz of the no smoking thing
And do u know how long is it going to be this way

I need to note that I'm one of the ( panic and over thinking) type of people
Which got me to start smoking in the first place...

Excuse my English it's my 4th language...

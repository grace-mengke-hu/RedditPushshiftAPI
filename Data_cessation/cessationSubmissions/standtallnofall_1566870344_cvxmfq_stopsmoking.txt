Quitters who used Chantix, did you use the one month pack or two?

I'm 20 days and 20 hours smoke free. I was a light smoker (averaged 5 or 6 cigarettes a day) for the last 10 years). It's gotten a bit easier over the last few days but still a pain in the ass.

I went to my doctor and got a Chantix script to help the process. I'm not sure if it's working or not because I didn't try and quit without it. I only have eight more days on my prescription. I know there is a 2nd month available but I'm not sure if I need it because I'm not sure if it's even helping. The prescription is over $500 (I'm an American) so I just don't know if it's worth the funds.

Those who have tried the second month, did you find it to be valuable?

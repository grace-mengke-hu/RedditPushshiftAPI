Quit after 25 years of cigs, 5 years of vaping. On day 8 now and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Shouldn't this be easier by now?

Just as the title says. I lost my mom to lung cancer 6 years ago. Vaping was a new thing then, but mom's last wish was for me to quit smoking, so I switched to the vape. Started at a very high nic level, got down to about 2% nicotine over the past 2 years, so I thought quitting would be a breeze.

It's not. At all. This is the worst I have ever felt in my life, including when I quit (low dose) opioids about 6 months ago. Yesterday was 7 days without nicotine (I'm still vaping 0% nic juice; thought it would help) and I thought I was over the hump, but today is even worse, if that's possible. Every day has been worse than the one before, in fact.

I cannot handle any stress, like at all. I've basically locked myself in my office and am avoiding my family so I don't blow up at them over the smallest thing. I had no earthly idea that it would be this hard. Am I just an outlier? Is this normal? When in god's holy name will this start to get better?

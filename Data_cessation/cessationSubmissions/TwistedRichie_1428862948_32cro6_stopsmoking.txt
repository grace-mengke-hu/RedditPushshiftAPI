One year tomorrow - Hard to believe

First, I tried to cut back.

Then, I tried Alan Carr. I quit for a month.

Finally, I used what I had learned from Alan Carr and just flat out refused to let the cravings get the best of me. If I craved, I would just deny that I was craving. I never really let myself wish I could smoke. Somehow, I rode that lie to one year.

(When I signed up for my badge, it said to pick the date I quit smoking. I quit on the night of April 12th, so I picked that date. The badge proceeded to count April 12th as my first day without smoking. Tomorrow is my actual one-year anniversary.)

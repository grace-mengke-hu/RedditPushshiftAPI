Smoke-free for 34 days. Going to a club tomorrow

Hi everyone. I've been smoke-free a month (phew!) and it hasn't been too difficult. I've been working up to quitting fulltime by stopping smoking at certain places etc for the past year (it has been a LONG time coming!)

Now my first real hurdle is tomorrow. I'm meeting some friends late at a club, which means I may have to walk around there for a while trying to find them (no one ever looks at their damn phone...). Now, normally I would relish this time. Just me and my cigarettes. To be honest, if I couldn't find my friends I'd still go home pleased because I got to have some delicious smokes and a drink.

How does one handle being 'alone' without a cigarette. I am scared. I fear I will be bored in these times and jealous of everyone around me who gets to enjoy the cigarettes. I am not interested in having one and I won't be tempted (I only stopped because I knew I could and I was ready) but the uncomfortable feeling of having something missing  in that environment scares me.

Patch dosing by packs?

I'm sure this question has been answered, I searched some but I'm either stupid, or shocked I have not found an answer. Little back story, started smoking when I was 16, I am turning 30 this year. I smoke easily over 2 packs a day, pushing 3 isn't hard. I've never really "quit" outside of a few days to a week when I wasn't able to. E-cigs, do nothing for me, I have crazy high 40mg juices, I still want a cigarette, chew, never did anything for me. Which comes to patches... I've half tried before, 21mg I might as well just put a piece of tape on my arm IMO. 

I ended up in rehab 5 months ago for alcohol by my own choice. Long story short I've been turning all my vices around, eating better, someday I might actually exercise, but all around I have slowly made a huge turn in my life and kept at it. Now it's time to drop the smoking.  

While in rehab was the last time I "quit" because I was forced to. I was not committed to it at the time because I had better demons to deal with. 21mg patch, they gave me gum as much as I wanted on top of it, and also being out of my routine, I still was bouncing off the walls wanting to smoke more than anything in the world. Alcohol at the time was the last thing on my mind, I needed to smoke like non-other, it consumed me.

Tuesday is my real self committed quit day, I'm too old for this crap now, and like I said before this is the last thing on my list to go, I've stopped everything else. I've never been sick from too much nicotine. I was told once there was a chart or sorts as to how much you smoke as to what mg of patches you should slap on. Since I have tried 21mg patches multiple times, with literally 0 effect in my mind, and gum with patches, am I safe to throw 2-3 on at once? I feel like someone out there has to be in the same boat as me.

I used a method called "Easy Way" to quit smoking about three years ago. Haven't relapsed or had a craving since I finished the Easy Way book three years ago. I am trying to get a new sub /r/easyway off the ground and I'm giving away 10 copies of Allen Carr's book.

I found the /r/stopsmoking sub today and thought you guys might be interested in this.  Here is the link to the give away:

Just leave a comment briefly describing your history with cigarettes and your reason for wanting to quit (health, money, etc.)

The top 10 comments will get a free copy of "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking."

If you like the /r/easyway sub and are feeling generous, leave a couple comments or post a link.  I would love to hear your stories.

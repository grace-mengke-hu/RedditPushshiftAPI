Day 3 - 3rd attempt at quitting

So... I know myself, that the worst time is the first week. I am trying once again, and this time I work at a place that other people don't smoke, so I think that I'll have a little easier time.

My problem is when I drive, and how to keep my mind off of it/occupied while I drive, as that's when I normally would smoke.

Anyone had any free/cheap ways of doing so?

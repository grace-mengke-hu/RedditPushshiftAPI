5 days

Okay, so, I have never posted anything but I have been reading a bit. This is day 5 for me and I just had to let you all know that I go here whenever I get a craving and as soon as I start reading all your posts, how you motivate each other and how you say it's hard but it DOES get better... It has literally stopped me from going to buy a pack. So thanks. Gonna get myself a badge... I'm so happy that I'm finally doing this. We all rock!

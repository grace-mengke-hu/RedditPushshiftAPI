Post quit tension, anxiety, being on edge. Potential support :)

Quick suggestion based on my anecdotal experience that could potentially help some people here. 

I noticed that when I started smoking I developed a general tenseness and unease. I was already an anxious person, but that was much worse. 

I quit smoking and expected this to go away. And it didn't. It's been 4 or 5 months (this quit I decided not to count). 

Now the bit of science that led me to what seems to be helping me a lot. Smokers have upregulated acetylcholine receptors compared to non smokers. These are supposed to go back to normal between 4-6 weeks. Big study about this google it for more info!

Anyway. I started taking Phosphatidylcholine last week. And I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT reduction in all of these symptoms. It's unbelievable. I haven't felt this level of baseline normal anxiety since I started smoking. I've tried a lot of different supplements. St. John's wort, magnesium, b complex, L-tyrosine, bacopa, inositol! I understand the placebo effect in myself for the most part, and this feels very different.

Looking into choline supplementation further, there are tons of people who anecdotally report the same experience. Take a look, be careful though. Some people report depression from choline supplementation. 

Sources of choline supplementation: Phosphatidylcholine, CDP Choline, Alpha Gpc

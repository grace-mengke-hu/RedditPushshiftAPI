Current quit attempt. Day 2. Using Champix

Here we go again. Each attempt recently has failed so trying medication this time. Saw a stop smoking counsellor and got some advice, as well as a drug called Champix, which my wife and father in law have been using very successfully. 

Day 2, and although I've had a few cravings there's nothing like previous tries. Pills are causing a bit of muscle aching and insomnia but nothing worse than that. Will see how we go.

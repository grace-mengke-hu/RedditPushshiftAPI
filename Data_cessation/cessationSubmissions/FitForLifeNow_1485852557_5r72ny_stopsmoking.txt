Now is as good as any time

I quit smoking successfully for the first time in my life last April after being a pack a day smoker for roughly 7 years. It felt amazing not needing cigarettes to cope with my every day affairs. I remember I was achieving amazing things at the gym, on the track, and in the pool. I also noticed an increase in concentration, being more relaxed/more calm at handling situations and just feeling like my "old (young) self".

But having been back hooked on it for the past 6 months....Enough is enough. Smoking a pack a day is eating away at my health gains/goals and finances. I am determined to become a non smoker again....

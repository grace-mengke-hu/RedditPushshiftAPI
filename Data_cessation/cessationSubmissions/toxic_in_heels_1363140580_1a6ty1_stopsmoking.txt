Day 74 feeling like day 1!

Thought I was doing really great, haven't thought about smoking for weeks. I even stopped checking my Cessation Nation app every day. I've even been able to hang out with friends who smoke. No problem.
Then today....out of nowhere....my brain has been saying ”smoke smoke smoke smoke”. I mean really? I'm blasting through mints and checking my stats every few minutes. What the hell?! Pardon my frustration.

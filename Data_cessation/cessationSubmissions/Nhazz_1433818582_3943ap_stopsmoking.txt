A close call. My heart broke a little.

I started smoking when I was 14, a pack a day or more for twenty five years. A week ago, I broke up with cigarettes. I expected to be a mess, but honestly, I've felt jubilant ... happy, healthy, empowered. Invincible. Until last night. I was looking for skewers to make shish kebabs and opened a kitchen drawer that I don't go into very often. A cigarette pack stopped me cold. I swear, my hands were shaking as I reached for it. The good news: it was empty, but now I know how weak I am. If there had been a cigarette in there, I would have smoked it. If there had been twenty, I would have smoked them all. I suppose it was a much needed reality check, but it made me sad. S'okay, though; the shish kebabs were delicious.

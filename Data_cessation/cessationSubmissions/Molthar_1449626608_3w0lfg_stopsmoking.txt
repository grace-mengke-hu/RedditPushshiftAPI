72 Hour Mark - Having Trouble Keeping My Motivation and Determination High

I decided to stop smoking last saturday. I was thinking about quitting it for a while. I thought it was the right moment after I had the last one. So I stopped smoking ever since. I am keeping track of my cravings and posting it online. I am not having the best time right now.

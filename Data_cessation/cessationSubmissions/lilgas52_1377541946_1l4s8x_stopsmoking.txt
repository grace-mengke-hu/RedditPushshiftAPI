Ive hit a week since my last cigaret, I could use some tips and tricks to keep going.

The last time i smoked was Sunday the 18th. Ever since then I've had this terrible hacking cough, and headaches. The cravings are almost gone, and the headaches are completely gone. I just need something to keep me from going back and buying another pack. Is there anything I can do?  
I eat sunflower seeds like crazy and that seems to cut the cravings a lot. I guess it has something to do with the oral fixation thing. Any tips from people who have made it over the 1-3 week hump would be great.

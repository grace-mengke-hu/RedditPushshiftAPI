I want to introduce myself to you all.

Hello!

I have struggled with nicotine ever since I was 13 years old. Never really been to the point where I was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, but I was smoking enough that it was a problem. I took my last puff 58 days ago (after quitting on and off again).

I have moved a thousand or so miles away from home to start my first real job after college, so I kind of lost my major support system. My buddy referred me here, so here I am I guess! 

Like I said, I never really was a pack-a-day person, but I did inhale a lot of unfiltered cigars, smoked a pipe, and "smoked" E-Cigs. After losing my grandmother to lung cancer due to smoking, I figured it was definitely time for a positive change. I still get the urge to smoke every now and again, but I am hoping that this is it for me and that part of my life is over.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Just wanted to introduce myself and thank you all for keeping this sub active for people like me.

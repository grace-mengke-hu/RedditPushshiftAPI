I need some help. My social life is suffering since I quit smoking.

I quit 10 days ago. Its going fairly well, but I'm afraid to take breaks from work, because I literally always smoke 4 cigs on my breaks. I'm scared to go out, and when I do, I don't drink, because I can't remember the last time I went out and did not smoke.
I figured I can't be the only one with this. I'm simply afraid that when I will spend free time with lots of smokers who are always generous with cigarettes, I'm going to rationalize ''One in the weekend, I wont buy a pack blablabla''.

Can't be the only one with this problem. How did you guys work this out?

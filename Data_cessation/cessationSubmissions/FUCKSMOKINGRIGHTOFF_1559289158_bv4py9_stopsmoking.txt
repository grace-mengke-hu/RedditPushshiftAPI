How things have changed ...

It's currently 5:46pm on a Friday afternoon and Iv only just thought of a cigarette ðŸš­ not having a craving as I have them so few n far between but just out of habit still sat on the lounge n thought of a cigarette ... Quite literally this time 48 days ago I would be worried about running out n making another trip to the shops to buy another pack just incase ðŸ˜Ž I love this free thing NOT ONE PUFF EVER !!

Can't Sleep, cravings stole my bedtime....

I just have way too much nervous energy and don't know what to do so I'll type. I started using patches about a week ago, while still smoking albeit only like one or two cigs a day. Here i am a week later, down from step one to step three on the patches (21mg to 7mg) and I finally went my first entire day in ...ten or eleven years, without a cigarette. Tomorrow(today) I plan to stop with the patches but it's gonna suck...my cats also getting fixed so theres that but Im not gonna let anything derail me this time! A few questions, when will the nasty phlem and coughing start to let up? also, what are some of the negative side effects I'm going to experience as i go through withdrawals? better to know and be prepared for it IMO. Thanks for reading my rambles....

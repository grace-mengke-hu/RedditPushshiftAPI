Trying To Quit But Living With A Smoker

Hi everyone,

I'm a terrible lurker. I'll read all your inspiring posts and then just think to myself "nah, I'll do it tomorrow". Truthfully, it seems that although I get the drive to finally quit my mother is a chain smoker and I still live at home. She always has been and I know she always will be. This is not her fault, this is incredibly my stupid decision to fit in with the cool kids when I was IN UNIVERSITY (you would have thought I would know better). Now, at 21, I work in a incredibly stressful field and my mom's opinion on my smoking is, as follows: "Hey, is smoking really worse than anti-depressants?" meaning that she will be fine with, if not, encourage me to smoke at home. 

I would usually agree that maybe it was time to move out but I can't, for various monetary reasons -- including returning to school to finish my degree come January (the main reason I got this stressful, if well-paying, job in the first place). Basically, I would like some insight on how to truly quit when I'm being encouraged to smoke. Any pointers?

Thanks!

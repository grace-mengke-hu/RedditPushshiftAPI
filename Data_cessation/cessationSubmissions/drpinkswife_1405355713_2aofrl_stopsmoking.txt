What the Fuck to do with All This Cake?

Day 2 of weird emotional Crappy McCrappyington-ness. I can't sit and smoke and sulk...so I fucking cleaned (that didn't help) then I started baking cakes.....I'm on cake three. I got one packaged for work tomorrow...guess we're having cake for dinner. Seriously need to find an alternative. What do you do now when you're stuck in a funk that you used to sit and smoke through?

I want to get my parents to stop smoking

My parents usually smoke outside because they want to keep their smoking a secret. But it's obvious because I found many packs of cigarets in their cars, cabinets and drawers. Anyway, as anyone knows, cigarets can cause deadly diseases and I'm very concerned about their health and I want to spend as much time with them as I can before it's too late. I'm also scared to bring attention to their habits. Any effective advice?

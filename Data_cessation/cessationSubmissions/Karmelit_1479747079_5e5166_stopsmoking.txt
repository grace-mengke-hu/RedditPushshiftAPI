Almost at a week!

Hi everybody, lurker here. I started socially smoking in April of 2015 after a nasty break up, and it developed into a half a pack a day quickly. I successfully quit in April of 2016 for two and a half months! But then I picked it up again. 

I tried quitting over the past month, but I never made it past day 3. I would browse this subreddit while smoking for tips on how to quit "tomorrow".

I finally decided I wanted to be able to fully taste Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Last year, Thanksgiving and Christmas were painful because I had to hide my habit from family. I was always angry and anxious because I was constantly detoxing and I did not enjoy any part of it. I want to take back control of my life and actually enjoy the holidays. 

I didnt want to jinx it, but I feel very confident in being successful this time around. The tips and community on this subreddit has been very helpful for me! Thank you!

Tomorrow Day 1

Tomorrow is day 1 all over again! I can do this!!!!!  After 33 yrs of smoking a pack to a pack and a half, I did quit for 3 months, started again but only 4 or 5 a day every couple days,, so this quit should be a Lil easier (I hope) than last quit!  Need to hit the gym hard tomorrow and stay focused!.
I CAN DO THIS!!!!!!!! Fingers and toes crossed please!

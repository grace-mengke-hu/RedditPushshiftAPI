Back on the patch as of the morning of Jan 1. First day back at work=more cravings but staying strong.

I had gone a few weeks without smoking some time in October 2016 but then that fucking second debate happened and then November 8th happened. I got really drunk during debates and just relapsed back into smoking and then kind of didn't stop given that my stress only got worse for various reasons, including my inability to personally murder Vladimir Putin in a slow and painful manner. Anyway, I kept setting deadlines last year when I would quit and never followed up until new years. I somehow got the timing perfectly where my 4 am cigarette right outside my house was the last one in my pack so I didn't have any more to smoke in the morning. Put my patch on on Jan 1 as I still had 5 left over and am on day 2 now. Looking forward to stepping down and just ordered 28 more days worth of patches as target was having a BOGO sale on them. The annoying part is that there are still definitely psychological issues already and possibly a minor craving for nixotene since I was pretty heavily smoking the last two weeks. Do any of you guys using the patch have similar weird minor withdrawal symptoms beyond just the habit cravings?

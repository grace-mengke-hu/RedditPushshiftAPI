Sad to see that I would be at 523 days today. Time to start over.

So I found this sub 523 days ago, the day I decided to quit smoking.  It went great.  I was excited for every milestone I hit.  I reached 280 days.  Then I went through a nasty breakup, it left me a mess.  I went from eating healthy, quitting smoking, gym 6 days a week, to regressing.  I started smoking again, stopped going to the gym, stopped eating healthy.  I've got control of my life again, and I need to quit.  I can't keep doing this nasty habit that I worked so hard on quitting.  I was in the clear, but I made a stupid mistake and thought smoking would help again.  So here I am.  Day 0 of quitting smoking.  Day 523, here I come.

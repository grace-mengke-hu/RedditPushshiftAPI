Finally doing it with the wife this time.

I have tried quitting in the past, making it to 1-2 months each time but it  as so hard to come home from work and not smoke with my wife. We are planning to start trying to get her pregnant in March so She has decided to join me and today is our first day off the darts. We ordered nicotine patches for free from Leave The Pack Behind and it would highly recommend using patches and gum. Thy definitely take the edge off. This sub has been great for information and inspiration so thank you all. Wish us luck!

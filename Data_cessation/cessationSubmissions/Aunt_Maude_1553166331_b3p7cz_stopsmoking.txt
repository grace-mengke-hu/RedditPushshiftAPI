Its a right bugger to quit but hey...

I'm still here. Just quietly not smoking. I read your stories, I walk with you as you struggle because walking with you means I'm not walking alone. I could fucking murder a smoke right now, but so long as I have you beside me, I'll be ok for another minute. And you'll be ok for a minute because I'll be beside you.

Together, we can get through these few difficult minutes.

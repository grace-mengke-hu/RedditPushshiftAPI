Had a negative experience with cheap e-cigarettes, looking to revisit the products.

I tried e-cigs twice and said "they're not for me" but looking back i realized that i bought very cheap versions of the products. These e-cigarettes hurt my lungs more than any cigarette ever had and turned me off the products immediately.

Sitting here staring down the barrel of hour 14 (i stopped myself from buying a few hours ago!) i'm starting to think that maybe it might not be such a bad idea to simply have a bit of an aid for a while.

1. Any personal experience recommendations for a quality e-cig?
2. Is there another product that is health safe that produces a more cigarette like experience?
3. Where in my local area might i start searching for one of these devices (e-cig or alternative)?

Note: I'm searching for *low nicotine* or preferably **nicotine free** options.

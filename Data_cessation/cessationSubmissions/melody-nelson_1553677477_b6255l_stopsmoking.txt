How to deal with mood swings and anger?

I stopped two weeks ago and it’s going well, I don’t have cravings anymore and not too many side effects BUT my mood is really bad. I feel like I’m going to snap every time somebody talks to me and get pissed at the smallest things. 
I’m trying to stay by myself as much as possible and to exercise a little bit but is there something else I could do to deal with this?

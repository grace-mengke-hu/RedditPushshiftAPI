Sleep (or lack of it)

I'm on day 5 and have so far been having trouble sleeping. I tend to drift off ok, but then wake up every hour. I go back to sleep each time, until it gets to 6.30, and then that's it for the day. The sleep I'm getting in between waking up seems to be deep and dreamless, and when I wake up at 6.30ish I feel pretty well rested... so I'm not really complaining... just find it weird! I wondered if anyone had experienced anything similar. Is this my new normal, or might I start sleeping through the night again?

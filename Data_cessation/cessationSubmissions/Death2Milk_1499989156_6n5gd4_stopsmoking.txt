Today on my 30th rl quit date/28th day on this supportive subreddit, I celebrated by doing hot yoga and being able to breath clearly.

Since I have quit nicotine and caffeine (with the help of smoking cessation meds), yoga has been my thing to help me clear my head and focus on myself and my practice. I have only been practicing for two weeks but I already feel stronger and happier.  Smoking cigarettes would have never given me the ability to breath deep and long.  I'm so happy I took the plug to quit (even after smoking for the past 17 years).

Smoking relapse after two years

I quit smoking just over two years ago, after smoking for 14 years. 

In the last two years I've had two kids and we moved from our apartment in the city to a house in my fiance's small hometown. I'm a stay at home mom to our kids. 

It's been stressful. A lot of things have changed in the last two years, and having two babies in a year has not been the easiest. My fiance and I have been fighting a lot, just over stupid things. We're both tired and stressed. 

I bought a pack on Sunday after another silly fight. I don't smoke in the house, and I only sneak outside when both the kids are asleep (before they wake up, after they go to bed, and on the rare occasion they both nap at the same time)

I feel so guilty. I put so much work into quitting, and I went so long without one. I feel like I'm starting back at square one. I don't want to be a smoker again. I don't want to get snappy with my babies when I'm having a craving. I don't want to stink like an ashtray when I pick up my kids. I haven't been hiding it from my partner, but neither of us has acknowledged it. 

But I also feel like this is the only time I get to myself. A few two or three minute breaks where I can sit on the porch and browse reddit and be *me* again instead of a mom. 

I'm at a loss. I don't want to smoke, but I don't want to lose those (pathetically) precious few minutes either. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I know I need to toss out the pack sitting on top of my fridge and be done with it. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest.

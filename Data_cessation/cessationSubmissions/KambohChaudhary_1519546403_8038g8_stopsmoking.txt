CBM Therapy for Cigarette Addiction

CBM is a computer-based therapy to train the mind to think away from negative patterns to positive thinking. Its a multi-pronged approach to help at most of one's psychological problems. In one study, it eliminated the need for visiting psychologists in 70% of the cases, replacing months of therapy with just a few hours of CBM. It can be used successfully for panic attacks, various addictions, cigarette, nail-biting and more excesses.

A good example for CBM is the "Happy Faces" app on android. Or use any other similar CBM app. Just use custom negative images in the app for one's unique problems. For example, use cigarette images as negative ones for cigarette addiction. It helped me excellent, hope it may help someone else too.

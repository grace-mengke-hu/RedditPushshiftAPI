[META] Should we start a sponsor system?

I know the badge system is working wonders, but I also know there's a very large amount of people who've decided to quit for New Years. Some may've relapsed already, others may sooner on. I even saw a guy who's gone two years without smoking and is showcasing signs of relapse. So while the badge system does work wonders, I was thinking that perhaps a sponsor system could work wonders as well. It's done in AA, I would think that in our community it'd work well as well.




Here's what I propose for the sponsor system:


1) **Duration of time since you quit doesn't matter**, but the longer the better. Being a sponsor means someone is looking at you as an enlightened individual to show them support through this hardship. If you've only gone for two weeks it may be hard for someone to see you as credible whereas someone who's gone for two years will be seen as someone who's got tons of experience.




2) **It will give access to a richer amount of support.** I, like many of us on here, really do appreciate every single person who's willing to slap us with some reality when we feel like we're slipping. That being said, we're nothing more than a bunch of blue usernames. Developing a relationship with a specific individual(s) on here (even if it's only to help with quitting and nothing more) will have a bit of a more profound impact since that person will become a bit more real to those in need of a sponsor.




3) **Testimonials, testimonials, testimonials.** We all have our own stories to tell here about our ups and downs, but these mixed with an individual that we're putting a lot of trust into will make them feel even more real. That's not to say that anyone's stories are any bit less real (even though we're a bunch of strangers), simply that connections with people will make those experiences more profound.



That all being said, I'd like to hear what the community has to say about this idea. Does it sound good or do you think the system we have is good enough already? If you're in favor of a sponsor system, would you consider being a sponsor yourself? Thanks for taking the time to read this and to reply with some constructive criticism(s)/support. I hope we all do well in leading sober lives and I hope whatever system you turn to helps you along the way for as long as you need it.

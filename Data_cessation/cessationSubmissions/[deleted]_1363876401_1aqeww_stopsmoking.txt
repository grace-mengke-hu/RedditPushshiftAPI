1 day, 14 hours in and I had a slip. 

I had a smoke when I got into work this morning. I didn't need it, but it was there and I just couldn't / didn't resist. I'd isolated myself yesterday, and have the same plan for the weekend to burn out the cravings. I will outlast this, is what I'm tellin myself.

It's hard not to be hard on myself for te slip, but I'm trying to look past it at the goal or finish line.

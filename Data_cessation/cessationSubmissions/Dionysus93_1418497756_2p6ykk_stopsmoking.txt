PLZ HELP; Smoker's cough/bronchitis from just a few weeks of smoking?

Been smoking for a few weeks because of lots of stress and final exams next week. Started getting a slight cough which when I woke up Thursday morning had turned into a full blown asthma attack (I am slightly asthmatic). I quit cold turkey that day and it's gotten a bit better but I still have had to use my albuterol daily to manage it. Please, anyone, I need to know what's going on.

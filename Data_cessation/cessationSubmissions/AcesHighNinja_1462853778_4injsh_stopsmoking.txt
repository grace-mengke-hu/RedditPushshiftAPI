Staying off for longer periods

I quit like 10 times in the last year, usually I can suffer trough the worst but after few weeks there is a party or I feel depressed/bored and I give in.

Drinking is the worst because I don't have as good time without smoking... And when I party I wanna have really really good time :)

I always use excuse like "for the last time" and then smoke few more days/weeks before quitting again :)

I am determined that relapse 2 days ago was last(badge) so looking for any extra tips that might help in few weeks when my guard usually drops down :D

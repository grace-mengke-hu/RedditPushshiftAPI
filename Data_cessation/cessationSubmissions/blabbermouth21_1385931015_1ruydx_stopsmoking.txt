How do I quit smoking?

I mean I've been smoking since May 2012 and I'm already finding it hard to quit. I've already tried quitting twice. The first time I was free for a month & the second time a week. Moreover I have friends who also smoke, I find it difficult to not smoke when they smoke around me. Can I please get some advice or tips on how I can my quitting easier & make it work this time.

Update after 27 days

I'm doing absolutely fine, almost a month in. 

Cravings are still there but I can resist them pretty easily by now. Healthwise I can't really notice a difference since I've always been quite active and smoking never seemed to get in the way of that. 

The bit of extra money is nice though so I'm gonna take my girlfriend out this coming week.

I just wanna give a huge thanks to the community here, reading your comments and posts really give me the energy and willpower to keep going. So thank you!

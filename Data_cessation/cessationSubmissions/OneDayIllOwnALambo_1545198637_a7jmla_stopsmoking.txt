What are my options to quit smoking?

I’m trying to quit smoking and need some kind of help, vaping hasn’t helped, I don’t think I’d wanna read something on it. And I have bipolar in my family and I’m afraid taking something might trigger it. But it’s too hard to quit smoking without something to help with the addiction..been smoking a lot for 6 years

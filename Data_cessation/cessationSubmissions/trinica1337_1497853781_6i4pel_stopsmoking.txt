First time

It's the first time ever, where I try to break up with smoking. I'm 24 and smoked since I'm 16.
It's day 5 and I could cry.
I know it's so much better to break up with cigarettes but i feel so depressed. 
My boyfriend tells me that he didn't seen me laughing since a while and I feel so stressed. 
I want to be a non-smoker.
But some tell me, that it's maybe not the time for me to stop.
Is there a right time to stop?
Please motivate me, I want to go on and not smoke again. But I have to say 50 times "no" in an hour!

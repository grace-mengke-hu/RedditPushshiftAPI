Smokers, ex-smokers, and non-smokers alike, does it feel when you indale for as long as you can?

I'm about 80 days in, it feels very lightly like inhaling after eating a peppermint. Would much rather have it be peaty whisky, or a cigar, but it's a cold and fresh feel. The first month my throat just felt moist and gross. How does it feel for you?

Day 6. Struggling with cravings and appetite.

I've attempted to quit many times, but this time I'm determined to make it work. I'm on day 6, cold turkey, and on the whole feel pretty good about it. Cravings occasionally hit, but I'm not letting them get the better of me.

What I'm struggling with is my increased appetite. I seem to have replaced cigarettes with food, and I'm finding it hard to stop myself from eating everything! I have body dysmorphic disorder, which essentially means I see my body in a certain way, suffer a huge amount of anxiety about it. This increase in appetite is causing me a huge amount of stress and anxiety. I'm determined to stay away from cigarettes, but I need to curb my appetite too.

Starting Over - Day 1

I was going really strong last week during my attempt, and had a breakdown on Day 4.  I'm starting fresh again today, feeling embarrassed at my inability to get this done properly last time (I was feeling so positive and really on a roll).  I'm trying to be a little more low-key about it this time, because I feel like hyping it up so much last time may have been a part of my downfall.

Looking forward to the great support I know this sub can provide, and of course, any advice anyone has is always welcome!

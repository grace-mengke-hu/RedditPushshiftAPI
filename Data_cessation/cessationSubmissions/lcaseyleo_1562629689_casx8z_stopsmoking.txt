20 days

So I've made it 20 days, the last 11 of those days I was with family non-stop on vacation and would not have had a chance to get away and fit in a smoke anyway. So I'm glad I went through the most irritable part of nicotine withdrawal before the trip started. I have felt better overall. But I'm eating more and put back on a few pounds that I had recently dropped. I'm thankful that I haven't been too tempted to buy cigarettes because I've been busy. Anyway, feeling pretty good about this decision to be a non-smoker and I'm glad to have a place to post these thoughts.

Day 3... This is starting to get easier.

While I still desire to have a cigarette, that urge is starting to lesson. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by that though, I have gone an entire month with smoking once before in an attempt to quit. Not sure why I picked the habit back up again after that time frame though. May have had something to do with me just giving in on something. I do find that my depression or my depressing thoughts tend to surface a lot more harshly during the times where I do want a smoke though. This is why I started my daily meditations though. I'm trying to learn how to change my thought patterns and regain control of my own emotional well being and life in general. If there is anyone out there who is having similar issues with depressing thoughts bringing you back to smoking, I strongly encourage you to look into meditation. It is helping me a good bit this time round. Look into /r/Meditation to get you started. There are plenty of nice people over there who are more than willing to help.

Almost 5 months smoke free!!!!

Its been hard, not going to lie. But I haven’t picked up a cigarette since New Years Eve :) the temptations are highest when I’m drinking or around friends who smoke. I was a smoker for 7 years.... its hard to quit, but so worth it!!! If I can do it, you can too. Stay strong friends!!! 💪🤗⭐️

48 hours!

Hey all, peace and love from Canada.

I'm 48 hours into what feels like my hundredth quit. In the past 3 or 4 years, there was maybe a week's worth of days I didn't smoke about a dozen(or more) "poppers". Not even by choice, more or less by lack of access.

I was heavy into them, and I let smoking those disgusting bowls change who I am as a person.

I'm slowly taking my life back into my own hands and I genuinely owe a thank you to this sub and anyone and everyone who's posted or commented on threads here for the past year or two. You've been a great help.

Thanks for everything. I'll hopefully be posting here again with a much higher number of days to be proud of. Goodluck all.

Day 3 lots of bargaining.

I'm telling myself that now maybe isn't the best time to quit. I should wait until it gets colder. Wait until I'm more prepared. Wait until I'm finished with a couple of stressful projects. Wait until I can take a few days off of work.

Ah!  Anyone have any advice on vapes? I hear there are nicotine free ones you can buy.

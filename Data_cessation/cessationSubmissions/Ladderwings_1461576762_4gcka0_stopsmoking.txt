So I've had some ups and downs...

... and have caved on one occasion, bought a packet, had two and ripped the rest of them apart because it dawned on me that they made me feel worse than I had prior to smoking them. 

To those of you with depression and anxiety thinking of quitting who are using cigarettes as a vice, I urge you to take the plunge and cut down/ go cold turkey - do anything you can to stop smoking. 
It may take a while, but quitting helps with depression so much (it has for me at least). 

I've taken the advice of other redditors and taken a gulp of water each time I'm craving - it's been a great tool. 

If I can make it 100+ days, then you can too, I got your back! 

This sub is great <3 couldn't have done it without you guys (recommended to me from the Smoke Free app)

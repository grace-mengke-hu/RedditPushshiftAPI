I'm still not sure how I feel...

Physically, I feel amazing. I was playing frisbee a few weekends ago and I thought I could go all day. I'm breathing much easier and I think that is great. Also, seeing someone in person smoking doesn't make me give so much as a second glance. However, when I see someone on TV smoking a cigarette it makes me pine for one, and I'm having dreams more often where I'm smoking. Any thoughts?

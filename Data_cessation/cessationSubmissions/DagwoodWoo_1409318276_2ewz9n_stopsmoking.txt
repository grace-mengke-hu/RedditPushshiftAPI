Is second hand smoke enough to reactivate addiction?

I wanted to ask you guys a question. I've been clean, like the badge says, for 50 days and am SURE I'm going to make it this time. What kind of surprises me, though, is that I find myself, with 50 days clean, in about the same condition as 3 weeks in. Once in awhile I have days with cravings or even begin to romanticize smoking.

What I'm thinking happens is that I spend a lot of time in very smoky bars & that this is enough to make me go into mild withdrawal & reactivate physical addiction. Does anyone else have experience with this? Is it possible that those levels of nicotine are enough to make me physically dependent again? I really don't want to change my lifestyle so that I have to avoid smoky places, but I guess if this is the cause of my cravings, I might have to do it.

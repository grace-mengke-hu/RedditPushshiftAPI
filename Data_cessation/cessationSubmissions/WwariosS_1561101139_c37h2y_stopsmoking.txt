Smoker who goes to the gym

Hi guys,

I've been smoking on and off for the last couple of years of my life. I would smoke around 10 cigs a day during college time, but when I go back to my hometown for the summer, I have no issue going cold turkey.

However, this last college year, i went pretty deep into it. Started chainsmoking, 2 packs a day, the whole shebang. I found it pretty difficult to quit cold turkey. I went back to the gym, but cant shake off smoking. Its really detrimental to my performance. 

Currently, i am limiting myself to 2 cigs a day (even tho i can burn thru a pack easy) in order to remain functional and to silence the cravings. I am having terrible insomnia, and shivers sometimes.

What are some tips do you have for me, given my situation? Im really depressed over this. 

Has anyone been in my situation? How did u get through it?

My advice to all of you who have quit

I quit for four years after smoking for twelve. I read the Allan Carr book and it worked. It worked so incredibly well. I smoked a pack a day before i quit and once I finished the book I quit, easily. Just after the four year mark I noticed that I oddly started to feel like I wanted a cigarette. Against all better judgement I eventually gave in and had just one cigarette. Well that one has led me to be back smoking a pack a day for the past three years. 
Don't ever have that one. It's more powerful than you can even imagine. 
Since starting smoking again I've reread the Allan Carr book a few times.  Been to a couple of the live counselling sessions and also downloaded the audio book and listened to it several times. The Allan Carr method is no longer effective for me. 
I want to quit smoking badly but just not badly enough I guess. 

This is my PSA to all of you.

As a side note I would like to ask for some resources that you all have found to be helpful. My personal belief is that I need to be in the right mindset to quit successfully so if I can read a book or watch a video that helps me get my mind in the right space, I can quit once and for all.
Thank you

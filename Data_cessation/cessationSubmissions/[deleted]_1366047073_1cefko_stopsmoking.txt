Hitting the brakes, sudden urge to stop smoking after 11 years, hopefully the damage is reversible. Day 1

I'm sitting at my University editing film when for some odd reason I figure why not do this. I look around the office and realize I'm "that guy", the only guy that smokes. I really don't smoke much to begin with, maybe 3 cigarettes a day during the week, much more on the weekend when I drink. 

 My smoking triggers include:
-Drinking Booze
-Post-workout (weird right)
-Morning on my way to work drive
-After noon after work drive
-Other smokers

To assist me I will:
-Use a stop smoking tracking Android application
-Continue to post on /r/stopsmoking to remind me
-Throw away the pack and a half currently sitting in my car in the parking lot
-Not drink for the first 2 weeks (this will be a hurdle)
-Play lots of video games to hopefully distract myself
-Avoid others when smoking
-Chew on toothpicks 

I don't plan on this being very easy since I first lit up at 15 years old and am currently 26 years old, but instead of hoping or trying, I just consider it done. Day 1, this should be fun. 

P.S. If anyone has a suggestion for a good web based or Android based stop smoking application, suggestions would be appreciated along with any personal notes you have on anything that has helped you on your journey.

Average time it takes for toxins to leave your system after quitting smoking	10 days
Reduced rate of dying from smoking if quitting before age 30	90%
Reduced rate of dying from smoking if quitting before age 50	50%

• 	20 minutes
Your blood pressure, pulse rate and the temperature of your hands and feet have returned to normal.

•  8 hours
Remaining nicotine in your bloodstream will have fallen to 6.25% of normal peak daily levels, a 93.75% reduction.

•  12 hours
Your blood oxygen level will have increased to normal and carbon monoxide levels will have dropped to normal.

•  24 hours
Anxieties have peaked in intensity and within two weeks should return to near pre-cessation levels.

•  48 hours
Damaged nerve endings have started to regrow and your sense of smell and taste are beginning to return to normal. Cessation anger and irritability will have peaked.

•  72 hours
Your entire body will test 100% nicotine-free and over 90% of all nicotine metabolites (the chemicals it breaks down into) will now have passed from your body via your urine.  Symptoms of chemical withdrawal have peaked in intensity, including restlessness. The number of cue induced crave episodes experienced during any quitting day will peak for the "average" ex-user. Lung bronchial tubes leading to air sacs (alveoli) are beginning to relax in recovering smokers. Breathing is becoming easier and the lung's functional abilities are starting to increase.

•  5 - 8 days
The "average" ex-smoker will encounter an "average" of three cue induced crave episodes per day. Although we may not be "average" and although serious cessation time distortion can make minutes feel like hours, it is unlikely that any single episode will last longer than 3 minutes. Keep a clock handy and time them.

•  10 days
10 days - The "average" ex-user is down to encountering less than two crave episodes per day, each less than 3 minutes.

•  10 days to 2 weeks
Recovery has likely progressed to the point where your addiction is no longer doing the talking. Blood circulation in your gums and teeth are now similar to that of a non-user.

•  2 to 4 weeks
Cessation related anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, restlessness and depression have ended. If still experiencing any of these symptoms get seen and evaluated by your physician.

•  21 days
Brain acetylcholine receptor counts that were up-regulated in response to nicotine's presence have now down-regulated and receptor binding has returned to levels seen in the brains of non-smokers.

•  2 weeks to 3 months
Your heart attack risk has started to drop. Your lung function is beginning to improve.

•  3 weeks to 3 months
Your circulation has substantially improved. Walking has become easier. Your chronic cough, if any, has likely disappeared. If not, get seen by a doctor, and sooner if at all concerned, as a chronic cough can be a sign of lung cancer.

•  8 weeks
Insulin resistance in smokers has normalized despite average weight gain of 2.7 kg (1997 study).

•  1 to 9 months
Any smoking related sinus congestion, fatigue or shortness of breath have decreased. Cilia have regrown in your lungs, thereby increasing their ability to handle mucus, keep your lungs clean and reduce infections. Your body's overall energy has increased.

•  1 year
Your excess risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke have dropped to less than half that of a smoker.

•  5 years
Your risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage has declined to 59% of your risk while still smoking (2012 study). If a female ex-smoker, your risk of developing diabetes is now that of a non-smoker (2001 study).

•  5 to 15 years
Your risk of stroke has declined to that of a non-smoker.

•  10 years
Your risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer is between 30% and 50% of that for a continuing smoker (2005 study). Risk of death from lung cancer has declined by almost half if you were an average smoker (one pack per day).  Risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus and pancreas have declined. Risk of developing diabetes for both men and women is now similar to that of a never-smoker (2001 study and 2012 study).

•  13 years
The average smoker able to live to age 75 has 5.8 fewer teeth than a non-smoker (1998 study). But by year 13 after quitting, your risk of smoking induced tooth loss has declined to that of a never-smoker (2006 study).

•  15 years
Your risk of coronary heart disease is now that of a person who has never smoked. Your risk of pancreatic cancer has declined to that of a never-smoker (2011 study - but note 2nd pancreatic making identical finding at 20 years).

•  20 years
Female excess risk of death from all smoking related causes, including lung disease and cancer, has now reduced to that of a never-smoker (2008 study). Risk of pancreatic cancer reduced to that of a never-smoker (2011 study).

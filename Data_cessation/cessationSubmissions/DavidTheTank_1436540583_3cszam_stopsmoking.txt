Just decided to stop. Need help.

I just threw away my last pack and now I've decided to go cold turkey.. Again. The few times before I lasted about a week each. I'm just looking for motivation and tips and all to help me keep it up. I need to do this since I'm leaving for college. Plus I've watched it slowly destroy my mom. And now that I have a girlfriend I can tell she hates it when I smoke and I hate seeing that in her too.

Update: my friend has decided to quit with me. Hopefully it will make it easier.

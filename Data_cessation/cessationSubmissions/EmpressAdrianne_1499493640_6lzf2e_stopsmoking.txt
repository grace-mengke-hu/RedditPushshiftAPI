This is so difficult to admit but I know it's only on me to do it

I smoke like a freight train. Like 1.5-2 packs a day. Nobody I personally know is as bad as I am. I'm not saying that to brag, but to illustrate just how awful this has become. I want to stop and am having the hardest time keeping away from cigs. I'm not around other smokers very often, so I only ever have myself to blame in all this. 

Most everything I don't like about myself can be caused by smoking. My awful skin. My under eye hollows and bags. My bad teeth. My lack of facial fat. My huge pores. My generally "older than I am" appearance. 

And beyond this, I am on a medication for life as of April 2016 that, combined with nicotine, increases exponentially the chance for a pulmonary embolism, or even just blood clots. And yet I've kept smoking. For stress. Or boredom. Or any of the myriad worthless excuses. 

I'm scared of all these things. And so desperate to not have to worry that I'll suddenly drop dead at a moments notice. I hope that I can salvage some of my appearance as well, to regain some self esteem again. To feel human and not ashamed to be seen by others anymore. 

I guess I'm writing this in desperation, that maybe there's good news for visible improvements along with the internal health ones. I can't stand myself and what I've done, and i wish I had never started. Please tell me I haven't completely destroyed myself, because as it stands now that's all I can see.

Day 8 COLD TURKEY, fuck mood swings!!!

Alright guys I made an earlier post about being able to taste things again within the first 48hrs. Now, it's like I can feel full emotions again. The goods and the bads. The swings are ridiculous, one minute I feel awesome, and then the next I just feel like having a cig. I will be victorious you fags!(cigs nt people).  On that note anyone have any advice?

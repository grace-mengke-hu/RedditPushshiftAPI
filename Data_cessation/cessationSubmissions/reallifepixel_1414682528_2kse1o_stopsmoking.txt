[Day 4] --- ARRGGGHHH!!! ---

Ok, I'm rolling along. Kickin' butt. Doing fine. I'm working from the house today and I really want a cigarette (force of habit). So, I scrounge through the house, but my wife took her pack with her. :: Whew. :: I think, temptation avoided. 


But in the garage, I find one of my cigarettes. ... ... ... damn it. I am here by myself. I can smoke it and now one will know but me. (And you guys, I guess, since I'm sharing this.)


What sucks is this The One Cigarette. It'll be the best one because it is going to satisfy that Itch. It'll bring about a great AHHHHHH.


But then, I'm smoking again. And that sucks.
And if I do, I'll either have to reset my flair or leave it up there, but'll it'll always be qualified *-3 days.


Ok, I'm going to go flush it down the toilet. BRB.

I wish doing the right thing felt immediately as good as taking the easy way out.


I'm sharing all this so 1) It's something to do other than smoke. and 2) I did it. And I suck at quitting. But I did it. And if I can do it, what's your excuse? Look. It can be done. To quit smoking all you have to do is... not smoke. That's it. That's all you have to do. It isn't even like you have to -do- anything. All you have to do is -not do- something. And trust me, I know that is *way* easier said than done, but that's essentially it. 


I hope this motivates someone to stay quit. [Good luck](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/alah0007/myblog/Stop%20Smoking.jpg)

Day 7 and the rationalizations are kicking in heavy. Help?..

I'm on day 7 of quitting cold turkey. So far it's been fairly easy and I haven't had any major cravings or anything like that.

But tonight the rationalizations have kicked in full swing. Here are the most recurring ones that I am having a hard time shaking:

- I can't work without smoking. 

- I am bored. 

- Life is meaningless, who cares if I have a cigarette? <-- rationalizations playing with my depression, nice tactic

- Now isn't the right time to quit. I should wait until I have more going on in my life. It's one of the few things that distracts me from my misery.

- If quitting smoking is going to make me even more depressed, then I don't want to quit smoking right now.

It goes on and on. I haven't caved yet, but I'm starting to get worried. I literally don't have anything going on in my life right now and I've been feeling somewhat nihilistic, and the rationalizations are starting to play with the darker side of me. I've been meaning to quit for a year, and with this many days under my belt I don't want to mess it up.

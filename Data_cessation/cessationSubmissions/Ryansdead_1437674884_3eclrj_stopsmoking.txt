Drags vs full cigarettes

I impulsively took 2 drags from a friend's cigarette yesterday. What does this community think of drags? Should I restart my badge? Haven't smoked a full cigarette in 2 days and my lungs already feel a lot clearer.
I will say though that nightmares have gotten more vivid and I woke up last night screaming in my sleep. I think my cravings and anxiety are being channeled into my dreams :/

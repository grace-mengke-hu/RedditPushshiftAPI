How do you know if you really mean to quit or just saying you want to quit?

Title kind of explains all. I am 25, been smoking since I am 16 about a pack a day, so already 9 years. Up until this year, I always thought; "I just started to smoke and I can quit whenever I want" because previously there were times I didn't smoke for 3 months, 2 months and few times of 2-3 weeks.. 


So with this confidence, I tried to quit smoking all together, and I failed miserably. I tried many times, and I couldn't last more than 3 days. 


I feel like my body is degrading. The chest pains, the coughing, skin degradation, teeth going yellow, tooth decays, smelling bad all the time, less powerful erections, not being able to climb stairs or run..



On top of that, now I feel like I am trapped and can't quit even though I clearly see that is killing me. 



I do know I need to quit. I do want to be a non-smoker. Then why on earth I just can't do it?

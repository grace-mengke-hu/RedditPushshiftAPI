If you're over 365 days smoke free I have a question for you

If you're like me, you probably tried to stop tons of times before you were finally successful. Every once in a while I read the posts here and they remind me of me before I stopped for good.

"20 days, but had a drink & had some smokes"
"It's only day 7, is sleeping always this hard?"
"I'm scared to stop!"
"Does anyone else get road rage?"

Everytime I read something like this I think "Yea, this was me a LONG time ago"

If you're under the year mark of stopping, and you're reading this. Just keep going. Forget any excuses that come your way, and any hardships that come, just push them aside. It'll be easier, and in a year you'll think "haha that was me, glad I stuck with it"

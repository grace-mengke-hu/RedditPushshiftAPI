I think I'm ready to do this.

I've been browsing this sub for months trying to find the courage to quit. Ironically, I have often done this with a smoke in my hand. I think I'm ready. You have all inspired me so much and I am proud to say I haven't smoked in over 48 hours already. I can feel myself getting more emotional and easily irritated. I'm starting to get a little scared. If anyone has any advice or even simply words of encouragement I could really use it right now. I really hope I can do this.

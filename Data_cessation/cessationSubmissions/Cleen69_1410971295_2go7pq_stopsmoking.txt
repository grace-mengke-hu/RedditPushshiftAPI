Still Strong

It has been 23 days since my last cigarette.  I feel better than I thought I would. I found the app SMOKEFREE and tracking my progress has been a big help. I do every mission no matter how corny I think they are. In the beginning I was brushing my teeth, drinking water and using Jolly Rancher Lollipops to help get me through the day. The lollipops were a big help in the car. 

I wish everyone the very best in this journey we are taking. It helps to know that we are not alone.

Day 4: Found a single cigarette while cleaning...

Found an old pack, with a single cigarette inside. I stopped what I was doing and sat down, with the cigarette in my hand. I sat there for more than 10 minutes (I looked at the clock) and contemplated "one last cigarette". It was the longest 10 minutes I can remember and eventually I shredded up the cigarette and threw it out.

I know this was the right decision, logically; that's easy to figure out. The part that really hurts is that part of me still regrets it, almost 10 hours later.

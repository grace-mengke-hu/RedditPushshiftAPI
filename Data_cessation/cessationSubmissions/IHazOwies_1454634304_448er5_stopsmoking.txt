5th? 6th? try. It's been 24 hours

I felt really nauseous last night, woke up with a sore tummy.
I'm just so tired. 
I can't stand the smell of my dirty clothes or blankets that have a hint of cigarette still on them. Everything is getting washed.
I really just want to give in, but I feel like I can make it this time. I've lost count how many other times I've tried, maybe 5 or 6.
Part of me wishes I could go back to being that casual smoker that only smoked every so often with friends or at parties. But I don't think that will happen, I think if I just lit one down the track I'll probably get addicted again.

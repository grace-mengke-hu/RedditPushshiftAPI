2 weeks tomorrow! Gave up on the patch 3 days ago...

So 3 days ago I gave up on the patch.  I'm not sure that was a brilliant idea or not. My lungs hurt really bad, I couldn't focus on anything and I felt like I could rip someone's head clean off. But I finally am feeling better and feel I can go at it alone,  cold turkey! I am a non smoker! And I'm lovin it! I made it 2 weeks and I am soo soo proud of myself!

I post on Facebook alot and I was wondering, do you think it gets annoying to other people for posting alot? My friends say who cares post all day everyday but I can't help but wonder....

Good night!

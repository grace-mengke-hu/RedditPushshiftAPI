Every single day is better than the last!

It just keeps getting better, each and every day!  I look five years younger already.  I haven't felt dizzy or sick since a few days after I quit.  I can taste and smell things more clearly.  Breathing is so easy.  I'm no longer falling asleep at work every day from a lack of energy.  The best part is that I'm proud of myself, instead of feeling guilty and beating myself up all the time.  It's very motivating.

Everything about this is good!

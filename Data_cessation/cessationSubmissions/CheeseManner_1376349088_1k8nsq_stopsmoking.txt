Nicotine patches are great!

This is for all of you who are cautious about the concept, I was too, although after wearing patches for even one day I now realise how incredible they are. 

Unlike times I have tried cold turkey, patches relieve me of that awful restlessness about the day, I don't think about smoking when I wear them, and I am in much better control of my happiness. I know there is still Nicotine in my blood, but overall I can maintain a more rational approach to the addiction and quitting process.

I am three weeks in, so wish me luck, and I hope this gives others confidence that they too can find a strategy to quit.

Lastly, quitting is HARD. It is great we have a forum here to aid each other. Keep up the good work everyone.

Nearly 45 days in, major depression?

Has this happened to anybody else? I feel completely lost. A few nights ago I found myself googling "reasons to smoke", yes REASONS TO smoke! :( I feel like I'm going to crack soon. I feel horrible, my sleeping pattern is screwed, I'm under so much stress and everything just feels so disconnected!

Back to square one ðŸ˜Œ Nicorette Gum ?

Day one, again. Little disappointed in myself for relapsing but happy that I've now learnt some of my triggers. Anywho, does anyone have experience with Nicolette gum ? Currently chewing a piece and it's making my throat sore. Is this normal ? Did the gum help you ?

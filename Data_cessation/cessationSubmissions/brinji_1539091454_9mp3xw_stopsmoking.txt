Almost slipped up after almost two years of quitting.

Been going through a bit of a rough spell lately, and was having a hard time coping. To he point where I actually went and bought a pack on Friday.  I got home, ready to open them and realized how stupid it would be.  I ended up just going to bed for a couple hours and sleeping it off. The pack stayed in the drawer until yesterday when I ended up just giving them away.  Such a waste of money doing that, but I’m glad I did.  It’s unbelievable how easy it is to slip up even days, months, years down the road but you can’t give in!

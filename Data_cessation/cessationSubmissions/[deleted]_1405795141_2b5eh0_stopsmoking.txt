Day 17... Wait... Day 17?!

It's a big relief but the days are going by faster than I realize. At 7 days, I felt physically normal again. After the 2 week marker, my nonstop cravings finally stopped. Sometimes, I get intense 5-10 minute cravings - whoever came up with that 3 minutes statistic has got to get a new watch - but I ignore them. Smoking is an easy habit to forget if you can restructure your routines.

Only noticed one *real* side effect: I'm starting to get disgusted by the smell of smoke and purposefully hold my breath whenever I see smoking in public. 

To everyone out there on the fence, you CAN ignore the little fucker managing your cravings. You'll remember a few minutes after they're gone just how badly the little rat in your head whispering for you to cave in wants to screw you over. He wants to kill you. You can kill him before he does.

I'm not even a little on the fence about switching to e-cigs, I'm done with nicotine.

15 years of smoking vs 48 days smoke free

Today has just been one of those days. I remind myself that I smoked for 15 years, a pack a day for 13 years. That's *A LOT* of learned behaviors.

I have made it this far, and for a moment I was over whelmed thinking about the long term, and if I would always have these sneaky urges. Of course not, with time and experiences without smoking they will be fewer and further between.

I live with an indoor smoker, and have went a day here and there not having any urge what-so-ever. 

I just wanted to post here to remind myself and anyone else who may need it, that this is possible, and much more pleasant with the right attitude. 

Stay strong!

*NOT ONE PUFF EVER!*

Working on it...Anyone else on the patch?

I don't have the courage to say to anyone but my husband that I'm quitting-in case I fail.  But I don't think I will fail.  I am using the patch which is helping a lot.  I still feel wishy-washy about quitting but am doing it anyway because I'm tired of hearing my lungs wheeze.  Sigh.  Any input from experienced quitters would be of help to me now.

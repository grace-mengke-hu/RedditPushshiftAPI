Thoughts?

So, about a year and eight months, I stopped smoking weed, I used to smoke in my room and the balcony so I wrote on the walls the day I quit, each time I wanted to smoke weed I'd look to that date and feel proud about it and stop wanting to smoke weed, it's kinda symbolic and works, so I started thinking about getting a tattoo of my smoke quit date in my wrist, what you guys think?

Digestion is wreaking havoc. Could it be related to quitting?

Should say - I've got a doctor's appointment so no need to recommend that. I just want to know if it's possibly related to stopping smoking, or if it's just coincidental timing.

I'm 25 & been smoking since I was 17. I quit at the start of this month and soon noticed a change in everything digestion related.

Stomach cramps most mornings, feeling the need to go poop more often and I sometimes feel sick directly after eating, although never actually enough to throw up. Also some general nausea and changes in 'bowel movement consistency'. (TMI, I know)

I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar. It's entirely probably something else is wrong and the timing is just making me think it's related.

I slipped up just a few minutes ago

I feel so guilty. I went 20+ hours without a cigarette(I forgot the exact hours)....but the mental fogginess messed me up so bad at work and while driving....I reached for a cig and lit up...

The strange part was that that cigarette made me feel sick to my stomach. I feel light headed, dizzy, even more disorientated when I was going through the withdrawal....nauseas and just guilty/depressed. I'm hoping that this motivates me to never smoke again. I couldn't believe how addicted I was to these damn cancer sticks until I actually tried so hard to quit.
I drank so much water...chewed like 7 sticks of gum to curb the cigarette cravings but still slipped up and it's making me feel so horrible about myself....I feel like one of those addicts on Intervention :(

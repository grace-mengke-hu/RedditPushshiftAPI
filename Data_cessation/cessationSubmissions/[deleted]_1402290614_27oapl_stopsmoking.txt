Tomorrow morning is the test

I am a 21 year old smoker. I started when I was 18, started before that with cigars (Captain blacks) at maybe 15-17, so I've been smoking cigarettes for about 3 years now, smoking all together for about 4-5 years.

Smoking about a pack a day ( When I can afford it ) it just doesn't do anything for me anymore, but make me feel like crap. I always feel like I NEED a cigarette, but I know I don't. I got the permanent smokers cough, low energy and not motivated to do anything.

I decided it's time to give up this filthy habit. 
Tomorrow I will try my hardest to resist the urge, the worst is the mornings for me, when I wake up I ALWAYS have a cigarette to get me started.

I figure if I can make it thru the morning and the day I can just give it up all together. Cold turkey might be hard, worst come to worst I will get the patch. Pretty much everyone I hang out with smokes, so it will be difficult for the first couple weeks at least. Time to change!

Wish me luck!!

I cracked....

I am on day two of being smoke free and I broke. The overwhelming want made me break down to take a few hits off a cigarette. I don't know if I can do this... I feel like a mental person with a devil on one side and an angel on the other. Sadly the angel even says to smoke the damn cigarette too.

I'm so pissed at myself right now. The good part is I had the ability to take three hits and be like throw it out now. I just want to crawl into a hole. This is seriously the toughest thing I've ever done mentally.   


As a note I have no cigarettes in my possession, and will continue this horrible journey.

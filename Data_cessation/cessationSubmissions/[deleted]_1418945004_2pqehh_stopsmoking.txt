How can I get my gf to stop?

I've been smoke free for a long time now (close to a year). I met a girl in May who smoked but she was "trying to quit". It didn't bother me too much because I knew how it was. Eventually it happens, and she seemed to want to stop.

But fast forward to december & she still smokes.

So how can I get her to stop? How can I help her to stop? I definitely don't want to tell her "stop smoking or i'll break up with you" because i'd like for her to stop on her own.

The problem is, I don't want to date a smoker, and I won't continue this relationship much longer, and the only reason is the smoking.

Any advice/tips on what I can do/say?


For those of you who might say "tell her how you stopped" i did (allan carr + genuinely didn't want to smoke anymore) but she just doesn't do anything.

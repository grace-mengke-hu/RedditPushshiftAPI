Struggling with smoking for 2-3 years.

Dear all,

I began smoking 3 years ago at the age of 20. I never smoked more than 10 cigs a day, and also went through weeks, even months, when I didn't smoke. 

So, it should be easy for such a light and recent smoker guy to stop smoking, right? Well: *NOW* I understand how addictive it is. The last time I smoke one was over 1 week ago, and I don't have much desire to smoke one now. But sometimes, completely random, comes this extreme urge to smoke, sometimes even weeks after my last one. And it feels like I have to smoke one, or else I'm gonna die or something.

And the point is: It actually feels *GREAT* to smoke one weeks after my last one. It feels so good to inhale the smoke, to let my body finally come to rest, getting rid of my stress and anxiety. I understand this is not very motivating to write it here, but I think I need to be honest with my emotions to finalize this issue of smoking, once and for all. 

However: Just a few hours later the withdrawals kick-in and I feel like shit. Fuck instant gratification.

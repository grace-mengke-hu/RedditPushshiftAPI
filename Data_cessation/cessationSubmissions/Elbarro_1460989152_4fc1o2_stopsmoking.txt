Day 1

I´m 23 years old and have been smoking for 5 years now. Decided yesterday that i want to stop, mainly for financial reasons since I´m a student. 
This is my first attempt at quitting!
The first day, yesterday, was not that bad. During the day it was alright  but at night for some reason the urge to smoke was increasing. Not as bad as i thought tough so I am pretty sure i can make it trough. 

Are there any tricks to ease the "pain" when the nicotine withdrawal hits?

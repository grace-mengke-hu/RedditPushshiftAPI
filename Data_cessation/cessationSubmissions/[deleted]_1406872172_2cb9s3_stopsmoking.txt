Made it a month! And a little bit of what I did if anyone is thinking about quitting.

Hi everyone. I thank you all for the support and tips! I made it a month and, really, it's going to last this time, I know it. Last year I quit for 6 months and made the mistake of thinking I could have just one. Nope, I learned I can't. It caused me to smoke for another year!

What I did was just use the gum. It worked for me. There is actually some cheaper [gum](http://www.theonlinedrugstore.com/sunmark-nicotine-polacrilex-gum-2-mg-mint-flavor-110-ct/?vfsku=1361336&gpla=pla&gclid=CjwKEAjw0ueeBRCmhozc-_DRrlUSJABihBEEq2IrCFWRLAcZ9KLefMFYFWpgg8ZZ5XPERuQruwpiIBoCOMDw_wcB) that I think is good because it is really hard actually. I don't work for them, I promise. But since it is harder, it kinda helps ease tension but it also doesn't taste very good so even though you're getting nicotine, it isn't pleasurable. Idk. It really helped the first few days and now I might have 2-3 pieces a day.

Am I addicted to the gum? No. 2-3 pieces a day is the equivalent of 2-3 cigarettes and no one only smokes that many, in my experience. Also, last year I quit the gum too because I know I gave a box away to someone else. So far I've went through 1 1/2 boxes which is about 150 pieces. 

So I'd highly recommend it. I know cold turkey seems to be the favorite method here but I think that is just too stressful, IMO, the first few days. It was nice being able to treat a strong craving with something that helped but that wasn't really addictive in the same way. 

So thank you all and I wish you the best!

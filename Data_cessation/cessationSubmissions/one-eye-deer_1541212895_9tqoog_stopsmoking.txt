Made it six months!

I've been struggling a lot recently (including joking with my SO about how I tend to do 9 months off, two years on, and how I can totally do that again...), but I've managed to keep strong. I think the only thing keeping me on board is the fact that I don't want one slip-up to "reset" my entire progress, and having to start day one again when I have 190+ days under my belt already. Even one slip up is an automatic restart for me and how I'm approaching this journey, so it feels good to say "my life feels like chaos and a cigarette would be GREAT right now, but I'm gonna go with NO".

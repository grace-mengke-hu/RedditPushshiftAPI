Do you know why cigarettes feel so good?

It's because they get you closer to your death. 11 minutes closer if I am not mistaken. Closer to meeting God. Those who chain smoke are so eager to meet God that they smoke all the time destroying their bodies getting ever closer to death. 

And Cancer, I heard from someone close to me that Cancer is God's gift to humanity in a form of a disease. It gives you time to say goodbye to your loved ones, because you know your death is ever closer. 

I used to smoke and still do sometimes here and there. But now I have control over the feeling. Psychedelic Mushrooms helped me cure from the chains of nicotine slavery. In the beginning I it some rough spots on my trips because I was destroying my body. Kinda like punishment that God was dishing out for me for destroying his creation. Then after I quit, my trips were much more pleasant.

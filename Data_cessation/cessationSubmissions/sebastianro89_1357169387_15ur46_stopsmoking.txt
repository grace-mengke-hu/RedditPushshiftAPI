11 days and going strong. Been smoking since 11 and 1/2, now 23. 

I  have to admit, I am relaxing like /r/trees from time to time, but cigerettes never again. Had like 5 beers today, my buddy is a smoker and i felt the need to smoke, but it was easy to pass by. I think finally the knob has switched to quitting for ever.
Need to think about gifts for my self worth 200$ each month now, life is so good :D

35 days and I feel free.

The urge to smoke remains, in the same way that the urge to pick up anything does. I know the action is there that I am able to draw on a cigarette, but that in no way means that I want to. Whenever I have an urge, small as they are, I have been taking in a full breath of oxygen in my lungs to remind myself where my body has been, and where it is going. It feels less amazing than I care to admit, but that only seems to be because I am used to it. Right now comparing it to wheezing, coughing, and itching for a fix makes me feel pretty damn alive and comfortable in my own skin. 

Thank you /r/stopsmoking. It can be done, it has happened yet once again, all it takes is the effort in wanting to believe the solution exists out there somewhere even if you have no found it yet. With that I will be unsubsubscribing, but I encourage you to reach out to the community. Adieu.

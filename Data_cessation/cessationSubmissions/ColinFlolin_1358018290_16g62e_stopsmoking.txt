Just left the funeral for one of my best friends, biggest cravings I've had since the first week. Help me out everybody.

I know the rest of the day is going to be really tough, but I also know that he would have been incredibly proud of how long I've quit for already and would hate to see me pick up the habit again. I'm going out to see the family for the rest of the day, which includes a lot of drinking and story sharing and well.. feels. 

Any words of encouragement would really really help me out right now. Thanks in advance everyone, you really are an incredible community

Edit: Thanks so much for the input everybody, it did help me out significantly last night when the drinks were flowing with his family and friends. It meant so much to be able to look down at my phone and see plenty of reasons from you all not to smoke.

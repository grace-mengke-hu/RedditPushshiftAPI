I'm new, sorry...

... and I really don't want to sound like a whiny bitch, but I'm feeling a lot of self hatred right now -- because I secretly want to keep smoking, yet I don't. I haven't smoked for 6 hours -- that's quite a long time, really. What to do? *Why should I quit smoking?* *Isn't life better with the enhanced experience of smoking?* But then... at what cost? Conflicted feelings. I don't know if you know how I feel, but.
Thanks for your time & consideration.

Ready to begin my first attempt. Looking for a source to purchase Allen Carr's book.

My mother and I both have smoked for years, and I have read wonderful things about Allen Carr's quit smoking book. My question is where could I purchase a physical copy? I've looked on Amazon and it seems there are a ton of varieties of this same book. The problem is, I don't know which copy is the 'original' book that I have seen referenced here. Thanks for any input!

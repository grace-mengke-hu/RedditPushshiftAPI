Taste buds after quitting

So I’m on the verge of quitting because my chest has been tight non stop among other things it’s good to stop... 9 years.
My question for you recent and long term quitters have you noticed your sense of taste and smell to come back quickly? If so maybe a timetable on how quick it returned? 
Thanks folks and wish me luck!

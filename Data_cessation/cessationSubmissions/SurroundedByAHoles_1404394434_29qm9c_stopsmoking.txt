Yesterday, July 2, was the middle day of the year. So, I guess I've made it half a year without one cigarette. I couldn't be happier!

Edit: How I did It

I am 30 and started smoking when I was 14. About two years ago I realized that the addiction was an inanimate force that had control over me. As a grown man, I didn't like the idea of something else having control over me, especially something that didn't really exist. I'd tell my self I enjoyed smoking, but I realized that was just the addiction talking.

I started gradually cutting back. First, I cut out smoking in the mornings. I noticed I had more energy in the mornings. Then, I cut out smoking in the afternoons. I realized I was no longer crashing around 3 or 4 oclock. Next, I made it a rule that I could not smoke until after dinner. Next, I could only smoke one per night. Then, I dropped down to just on the weekends. That turned into only smoking when I drink on Friday and Saturday nights (I was never into drinking during the week anyway).

Around this time I'd start getting really frustrated and anxious on Thursdays and Fridays, waiting for that first smoke when I got off of work and had a beer. That part was annoying. So, finally the time came to get over the hump. The first few weeks were hard, but the battle was really around just the weekends. That made it easier since I was used to not smoking during the week.

Each weekend gets easier. I use breathing exercises whenever I feel frustrated. And when I get that "boredom" craving I do pushups or run up and down some stairs. This helps a lot.

Best piece of advice I can give, honestly: stop being a fucking baby about it and take charge of your damn life.

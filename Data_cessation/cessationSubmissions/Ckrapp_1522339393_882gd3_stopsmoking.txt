Thanks everyone! From a happy wife!

I just wanted to follow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7xmqeu/husband_2_weeks_smoke_free_wants_to_stop_the_patch/). My husband has made it 67(!) days. I know he has a long ways to go but he has come SO far. 

I really appreciate the advice I got when I came here looking for ways to support him. He found success with the step down patches and using toothpicks. He initially wanted to stop the patches a month in, but he didn't. He read that black pepper oil helps with cravings so he adds a little to his mint toothpicks and those have been very helpful to him. 

I know it's not easy, (it's not easy watching someone you love struggle with this either) but it's possible. He's happy he's not a smoker and I cannot tell you how happy I am he's not one. Thank you everyone and keep it up!

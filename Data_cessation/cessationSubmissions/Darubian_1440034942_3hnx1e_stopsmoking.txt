I start tomorrow with the help of Chantix but I have my concerns.

So I really just want to keep this simple as there is only one thing that worries me in taking this medication to quit. I am not the most of pleasant people to share a bed with. Sleep walking, talking and on rare occasions I have become violent.

I have never really addressed any of those issues with professional medical help and admittedly they have all become scarce over the years. My fear is from the stories of how Chantix affects people while they sleep. Should this be a serious concern of mine? Am I over thinking it? Do you have any suggestions to mitigate the potential night time issues?

Wish me luck :)

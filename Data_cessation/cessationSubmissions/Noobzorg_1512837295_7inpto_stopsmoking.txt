3rd day without smoking. Going out tonight and need help

So, pretty much the title. I quit smoking a couple of days ago and I'm tense and easily irritated a lot now. Regardless of this I'm powering throug. The thing is I'm going out with some friends tonight (a lot of them smoke) and I fear that when they go out to smoke every hour or so I'll eventually give in. Should I just stay home? I'm not sure I can go out right now and not smoke.

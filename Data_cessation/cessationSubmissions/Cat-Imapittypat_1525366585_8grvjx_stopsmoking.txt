Scared to Try Quitting (Depression, Anxiety)

I'm in my late 20's and have smoked for nearly twelve years (I started in my preteens). I've suffered from severe depression in the past, and actually started smoking to end a different bad habit when I was younger (and, of course, my parents were heavy smokers).

My life and depression aren't as tied together now as they used to be, but anytime I've gone more than 5 hours without a cigarette, the depression and anxiety just come straight back. I start crying, start thinking of all the shitty things that have happened in the last ten years (lots of family deaths, moving, fucked up relationships, you name it). I just spiral every time I make a quit attempt.

The longest I've ever quit was a month, and during that month I was completely apathetic and life had zero meaning. Which is sad, because I have an extremely loving partner and we have a (relatively) calm, happy life.

I guess this post is made both to vent and to ask for advice: others who have quit smoking with a history of depression, what really helped you? Cessation drugs are off the table for me, and I already have a vape whose novelty wore off completely a long time ago. I've been in therapy many times over the years but haven't been recently because my life situation has improved dramatically.

Thank you to the creators of this sub and all the people who make quitting possible every day.

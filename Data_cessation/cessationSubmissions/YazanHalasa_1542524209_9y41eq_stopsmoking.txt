Smokers who used vape to quit

Hey guys I’ve recently quit smoking (4 days so far) 
And I’ve been vaping a lot (~1.5ml a day) of 3% juice, i used to smoke a pack of 0.7mg nicotine cigarettes a day, am I getting more nicotine than I used to? 

also ive been having severe progressive headaches that go away when I smoke half a cigarette, I’ve been smoking 1 or 2 for the past couple of days when the pain becomes unbearable, any recommendations? 

I also plan to quit vaping with time, any advice on people who transitioned between smoking to vape then nothing?


Thanks in advance.

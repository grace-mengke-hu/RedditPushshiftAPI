Her kids are too young!

Katherine and I worked at the local theater together in high school. That's where she met her husband, Phillip. Her parents are (were?) chain smokers and I couldn't go back to her house after my first visit because it actually HURT to breathe the air inside.

She's 35 and dying. Please help Phillip and their children, even if you have only $5.00 to share. Thanks, this is absolutely heartbreaking.

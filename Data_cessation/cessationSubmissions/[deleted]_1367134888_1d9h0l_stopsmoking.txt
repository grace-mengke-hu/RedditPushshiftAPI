100 days then relapsed, don't give up!

After about 100 days I was feeling depressed from my band not making it through battle of the bands round 1, and started thinking "I was happier when I smoked" and other stupid things. I ended up taking myself back into smoking (by talking to a smoker who i knew would tell me to smoke). I smoked 3, 5, 9, 9 a day determined to get hooked again, but ended up getting sick and realizing how fucking stupid I was.

So here I am, day 2 super easy this time.

Just wanted to tell everyone not to give up, and just because you quit smoking doesn't mean that everything is gonna go your way or that life will be perfect, but smoking WILL NOT HELP!

btw. first post, this reddit was super helpful last time thx everyone!!

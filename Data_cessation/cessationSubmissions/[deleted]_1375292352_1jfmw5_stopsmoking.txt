I am not a social smoker. I am an addict

So - I always considered myself a 'social' smoker - not a 'real' addict. A few weeks back someone close to me asked me to quit - so I thought I would quit cold turkey, and it would be super easy.

It's not. I reset my badge for the second time in two weeks today. 

I think I need to admit I have a problem before I can fully face it down. I am an addict.

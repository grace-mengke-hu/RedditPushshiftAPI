Uh oh big time craving...

I'm traveling to my bf and I'm waiting for the  local train atm. When I was sitting on the bus the cravings began and now they keep getting worse. Bought a coffee and trying to breathe deeply and just ride out The storm. There is a convenience store right beside me. Would be so easy to run in and buy a pack. Damn it. Advice please?

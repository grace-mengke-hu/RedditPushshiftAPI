Who else around here quit for their New Years resolution as well? (Almost one month guys!)

Just wanted to say that I fairly recently discovered this amazing community! You guys are awesome! I would love to hear some stories from those of you that have been sticking with your New Years Resolution to quit smoking cigarettes. Lets help motivate each other, we can get through this.

19 days not smoking - anxiety is through the roof

Hi guys,

So I quit abruptly 19 days ago - and I do not miss it generally. However, at moments of stress, it was my escape and I don't have that anymore. 

Right now I'm quite anxious, and I read that this could be due to stopping, but it's affecting my sleep quite a bit. I used to smoke around 15-20 a day, so quite a lot. Was wondering at what point the anxiety would go down a bit as it's really hard right now not smoking.

Thanks.

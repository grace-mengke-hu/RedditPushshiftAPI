After 150 days smoke free, I smoked one cigarette yesterday

And really felt like crap this morning when I woke up and realized, that I had smoked. :( I was at a company party and I don't know what happened, but I ended up to the smoking area and someone offered me a cigarette and I didn't say no. 150 days all into waste.. I feel like I have let myself and everyone else down, because I was doing so good and was very happy about reaching 150 days milestone.

I also quit cold turkey 150 days ago and it hasn't even been that hard really, because I was very determined about not smoking even one cigarette ever again in my life, I've gone through numerous of events where I used to smoke before during the months and haven't smoked, so I don't know what happened yesterday (might be vodka that happened). 

So, now back to square one.

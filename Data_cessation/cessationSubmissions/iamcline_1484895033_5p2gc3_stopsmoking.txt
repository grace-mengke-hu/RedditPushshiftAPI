After twelve years of smoking, I have given it up! Smoke free for 7 Days!

A lot of people here have been a great inspiration for me while quitting so I'd to share my (brief) story. I started smoking when I was 18 years old out of curiosity only to have it become a part of who I am/was as a person.


I have tried multiple times before (quitting) by trying the gum, the patch and almost tried the lozenges. I also tried by using candy, to no avail as I just developed a candy addiction and/or returned to smoking fairly quickly.


Now 31 years old I've made it smoke free for a full week, 7 days! I stopped cold turkey last week after deciding I was just tired of buying freakin' smokes. Some more backstory: At my peak I was smoking two and a half packs per day but at the time of quitting I was averaging 12-15 cigarettes per day.


I found the first 24 hours to be absolutely infuriating. I tried to hide on my XBOX One but got so mad at an online game that I smashed it (RIP/Kind of) but I didn't crack. Day two was a bit smoother, I was still a bit on edge but was able to keep focus and avoid online gaming (on PS4). Day 3 was the strangest but also the most satisfying. On Day 3 I had extreme peaks and valleys but knew that if I got through a 15 minute burst, I'll have an hour or two of peace and I did. At the end of Day 3 my s/o bought me a new XBOX as a present and to show me that she understands (why I blew up at the XB1 like a fool).


Days 4-7 have been nearly similar. I will say that I don't have a craving once I wake up anymore. My routine used to be wake up, can of Monster, two-smokes and then I'm human. Now however it's me on the couch trying to get through dry eyes to see my smart phone.


Ok well I'm running out of fun stuff to say, ADD (crap excuse but I just quit smoking so I'm having trouble focusing, muahaha).

Thank you all for reading. I'll try to post updates when I can.

Just read Allen Carr, failed after 1 day...

Hi there,

28 yo male, been smoking since I was 14.

I already made it a couple of time: 1 year and a half, 8 months, 6 months and 4 months.

The first time Allen Carr's book helped, and I truly believe I don't want to smoke any more.

I know the withdrawal symptoms only last a couple of days, but I couldn't make it through.

I was felt tired dizzy all the time. I kept repeating myself "it's just the addiction leaving my body" and "the only way to get rid of this is to quit" but it was too hard. Interacting with people made it worse.

I felt worthless, without energy.

I just need to make it to 1 week, after that it will be really easy (it has always been).

Anyone can help? I feel really depressed...

**EDIT**: Wow, thanks for the support! That's truly helpful. I'll get back on the horse asap :)
You guys are amazing!

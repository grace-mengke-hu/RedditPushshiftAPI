Almost done with day 6 and I am happy to be a day before my first week as nicotine free. :)

Wow! I never realized how much of a mind trick cigarette withdrawal is. Even though it was very hard the first 3 days, it got easier as long as I kept reminding myself that these feelings of insecurity, cravings, anxiety or depression are all imaginary notions in the head --not depictions of reality. Now it has been getting easier each new day. I hope everyone out there is doing well. Keep it up!

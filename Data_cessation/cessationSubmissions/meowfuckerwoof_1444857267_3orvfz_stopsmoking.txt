almost 3 days

I love this sub reddit and all the positivity. I'm on day 3 and it was a ton easier than I ever thought it could be. I smoked about a pack a day and I loved smoking with coffee/energy drinks/ alcohol. 

I think once you realize that the reasons you thought you liked cigarettes are just your mind playing tricks on you to get nicotine. 

happy no smoking!

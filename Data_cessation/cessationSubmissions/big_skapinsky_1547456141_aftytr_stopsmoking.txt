Quitting tomorrow... I'm scared.

So I set my quit date a month ago, and as the date grows closer, I've been feeling more and more scared. I've quit once before a few years back and lasted 7 months. I remember how I felt better mentally and physically, but I can't shake off this uneasy feeling about tomorrow...

Man these cigarettes really are evil. I hate them but I'm afraid of living without them...

Any tips on how to get over this?

Any tips to avoid smoking when you become angry/stressed?

Broke yesterday/today due to anger only two days in... need some tips to avoid smoking after I become stressed/angry as that's the top reason I keep going back.

Any useful ways to calm down without inhaling tar? 

Running seems like the best shot, but I'm looking for tips for when I'm trapped inside the house on a rainy day.

My mom peer pressured me into smoking again

I was first introduced to smoking at age 20 because my mom would be like “here I dare you to try this” and after a coughing fit, we’d laugh about it together and she’d offer me more and more. I started stealing them from her after a while and then started buying my own packs. 

3 years later and I start smoking upwards to a pack a day. Well, 3 weeks ago I had finally quit due to an infection in my cheek but since that infection is gone, I haven’t touched one since. 

But yesterday, my mom gave me one again and said she was proud of me for quitting, and handed me one as a reward...not realizing how addictive my personality is. I saw the cigarette staring at me right in the eye, and contemplated “what have I been doing these 3 weeks out of boredom?” And felt more bored than I ever have the moment I looked that cigarette in the eye. 

It’s been yesterday and I’ve already smoked a full pack. What do I do? It feels like I need another infection to stop me from smoking again.. can anybody convince me why it’s better not to? I feel helpless, and really angry at my mom &amp; myself for giving in to peer pressure

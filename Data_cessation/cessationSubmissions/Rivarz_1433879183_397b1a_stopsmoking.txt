Day 1 quitting, question about mini lozenges

Hey all. Day 1 if quitting is going pretty well. Smoked 12 years at a pack a day. Cravings haven't been too bad, but it's weird getting used to not smoking during certain activities/times of the day.

Question to anyone using mini lozenges. The directions say to put it in side of mouth, move occasionally, let it disolve completely in 20-30 minutes. My problem is these things make my mouth water like crazy and I've had to keep a spit cup next to me at work to make sure I don't swallow anything after it stops tasting funny. They're also taking closer to 40 minutes to dissolve completely. Is this normal when starting, or am I doing something wrong? Any advice is appreciated!

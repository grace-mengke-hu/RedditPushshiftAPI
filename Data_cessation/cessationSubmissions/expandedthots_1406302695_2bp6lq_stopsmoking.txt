20 days question

Hey guys, got to 20 days and really never thought I would. Question though, the first 2 weeks were fairly easy for me because I was pretty committed to quitting this time, but this past week has been a little rougher as I've started dreaming about smoking and just getting slightly more intense cravings. Is this normal? I'm still really committed and still avoiding triggers as well as I can, just didn't expect it to get harder now.

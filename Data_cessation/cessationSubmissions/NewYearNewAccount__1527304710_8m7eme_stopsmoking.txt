Just quit and I'm literally telling people to shut the f*ck up about smoking cause I keep getting grief

All fun and games as far as their concerned but god damn how many times do I have to politely say "hey I can't talk about this" and they just go on and on.  Don't do this. Don't do that. You'll gain weight.  Bla bla bla.

Its me. I know. I'm the one on edge but FUUUUUUCK how do I just chill out and not let everything bother me?  I should have never mentioned it in the first place.

I don't like feeling this high strung and on the defense.  I just want to relax. Fuck.

"shit birdfemme, you got fast"

So I play hockey and a couple days ago I went and skated somewhere where I haven't for about 6 months. One of the guys I used to skate with was there and said to me, "shit birdfemme, you got fast" and i was like haha thanks... I stopped smoking. Felt nice for someone to recognize improvement enough to comment on it!

Remember your little victories to remind yourself it's worth it!

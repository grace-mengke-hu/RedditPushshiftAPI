Day Five, Day one without gum...did I screw this up?

I turned 21 last week and decided that I was long overdue to finally make cigarette smoking just another dumb thing I did as a teen and move on with my life.  I gave myself a day (that turned into three) to not feel miserable as I was trying to celebrate, and then bought a box of nicotine gum, tossed my last pack, and got serious.  I felt alright as long as I popped a piece every few hours, but man, that stuff is vile!  I hated the flavor, I hated how it made my mouth and throat feel, but even more so, I hated how I knew I was just getting addicted to that instead of the cigarettes.  I don't want to be addicted to anything, so today, no gum.

It was a shitshow.

I didn't smoke a cigarette, but I did spend my entire shift (retail) on the verge of going absolutely apeshit, may or may not have yelled at my manager this morning (thank god I was actually in the right), have the worst headache/nausea, and now can't sleep.  I know it will pass, and I know I brought this upon myself by getting myself hooked at age 16 in the first place, but I don't know how much longer I can take feeling like this.  I don't have a day off until next Friday...

Advice?

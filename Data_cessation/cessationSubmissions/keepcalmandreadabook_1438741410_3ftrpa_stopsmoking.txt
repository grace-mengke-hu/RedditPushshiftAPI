56 days... crash and burn.

Was going great, met a girl that I really like that smokes. Not only smokes, but smokes Turkish Royals, my absolute *favorite* kind of cigarettes.

I said it was no big deal, I've been around smoking before, but you know how it is with hanging out with your SO on weekends and stuff... we get high and have fun and after a week of not smoking around her I end up joking about it, putting one in my mouth and shit, and she's like no, trying to stop me, but in the end it was my fault, I caved, I had one, although she was supportive and didn't want me to start.

So now I'm back to square one. I bought a pack this morning and am smoking the shit out of it and trying again tomorrow. I'm hoping that if I don't have the addiction this strong yet, that I'll be able to do it. I'm so pissed at myself. I should throw them away right now but I have a routine when I quit and it has to be the last one before bed.

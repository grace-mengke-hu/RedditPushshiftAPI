Using nicotine patches?

I haven't smoked for almost 2 weeks, but I've been on nicotine patches from the NHS. The nicotine patches are great and the few times I've thought about smoking (usually out of boredom) I've realised I don't really want one and it's cool. The patches I am on are 25mg and will be on them for 6 weeks, before moving onto 15mg and then 8mg. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had problems after they have finished their course of patches. I'm hoping by the time I'm finished I will be so used to not smoing that i won't think about it, but worried the cravings might come back. Anyone been in this situation?

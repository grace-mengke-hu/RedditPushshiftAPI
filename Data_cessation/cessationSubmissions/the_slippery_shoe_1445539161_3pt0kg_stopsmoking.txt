13 days free, how to cope with the irresistible urge to smoke while drinking alcohol?

Hello, I quit smoking 13 days ago (I've been smoking for about 9 years) and I don't have any problems during regular days, but as soon as I start drinking alcohol, I can't seem to stop thinking about cigarettes. Does anyone have any useful advice?

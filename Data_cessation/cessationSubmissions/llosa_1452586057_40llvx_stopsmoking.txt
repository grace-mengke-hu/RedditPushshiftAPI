Fun fact about Fidel Castro

...He doesn't smoke anymore. He quit in 1985 after 44 years of smoking (started when he was 15).

Not sure why this fact really resonated with me, but if the leader of the CUBANS, whose national economy and prestige rests on tobacco products, can quit smoking, so can you. 

A large part of Castro's public persona was based on cigars as well...there were photos of him with cigars everywhere until he quit. So his social pressures were greater than many of ours. 

It's always nice to find a fact like this, hope it gave you a little boost today.

Quiting... And quite honesty terrified

So i have been smoking since i was thirteen years old. Today im 27. Through the years i have continued, even though personally speaking smoking cost me alot,  outside of money. I have been constantly through the late night super pumped I JUST RIPPED THE SHIT OUT OF MY LAST PACK phase, only to give up the next morning. I have finally decided im going to do this if it kills me. However, there are a few things that scare me. One, all i do is smoke. In this i mean

1. Take a shit smoke
2. Wake up smoke
3. Eat smoke.
4. Drive Smoke

AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST SHAMEFUL smoke while in the shower...

Im really scared because my whole life literally revolves around smoking. ( A very solid reason to quit now that im thinking about it). Two i suffer from chronic depression and some intense anger. Wont quiting exacerbate these issues. I want so badly to be clean and stop being tired all the time. Prayers are welcome, if thats your thing. Also any advice on how the hell im about to do this. Thank you all for your time.

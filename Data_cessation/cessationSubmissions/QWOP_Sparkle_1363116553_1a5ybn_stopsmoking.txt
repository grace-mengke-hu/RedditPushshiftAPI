Today has been the most stressful day since quitting...

Where the buck do I start?

I have an assignment due in tomorrow, I can NEVER concentrate on work during the day, more of a night owl than anything. So...been chilling out all day. Gotten ready, at the Uni 24/7 library doing work.

* First off, preparing food, pasta sauce is moldy, sets me back half an hour trying to prepare fresh food for the night.

* Second, get to library, realise I've left my USB stick at home. After carrying 12 books I was lucky enough to have the librarians watch my stuff.

* Thirdly, speed-walk home, retrieve USB stick, get back as librarians are leaving. First computer won't let me log in, second faulty. Sets me back another half an hour.

* Fourth, find computer, wait ridiculous 20 minute log in time. Save file has corrupted on USB stick. 

And now I'm sat here, waiting for friends to watch stuff while I run back home to retrieve the save file off my mac and return.

I can't concentrate at home, hence why I'm doing my work here. But still, the temptation to smoke has been the highest today than it has been in the past few weeks. Just EVERYTHING has gone wrong.

I was meant to start my work at 5:30pm, it's not 7:30pm.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAH. Resisting well. I need positive vibes Reddit >.<

**EDIT** : Thank you all for commenting, just incase you're wondering, no I didn't spark up xD as of this edit it's now been 4 weeks since I quit! No way I want to reset that counter. Also, I did have my nicotine gum because more stressful situations arose at home...but saying that, the last time I had a piece of the gum was 2 weeks prior, so that was just a one off. It was either that or get more tempted to run to the shops >.< yesterday was horrible. ba!

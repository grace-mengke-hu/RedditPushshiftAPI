1 Year 1 Day!

Man the first 2 weeks was hell, the 2 months after those 2 weeks were a slog and moving into the 3rd months was an uphill battle but compared to those 90 odd days, the 270 odd days after were blissfully easy and was mostly spent not even remembering I used to smoke even when I have smokers around me.

It gets easy, easier and after that, it's autopilot. To those just starting off, keep it going. When everything clicks to you as a none smoker, you don't even feel the days go by.

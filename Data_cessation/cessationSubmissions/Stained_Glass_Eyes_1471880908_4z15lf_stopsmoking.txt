Just made it past a week but cravings are now worse than before.

I'm about a week in and I am really excited to live a smoke free life but these cravings are getting so intense.  It is completely distracting and it feels like a tight knot in my stomach slowly moving up my chest.  Any advice which requires no nicotine?  I'm doing this thing cold turkey.  I've gone 3 months cold turkey before so I know I can do it.  Thoughts?  Also wanted to introduce myself!  Glad to join y'all as a non-smoker :)

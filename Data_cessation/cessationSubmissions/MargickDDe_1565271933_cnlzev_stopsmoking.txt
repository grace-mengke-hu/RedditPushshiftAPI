How can smoking cessation affect me if I have an undrelying mental health condition?

I started smoking to self medicate. Not to look cool, peer pressure, blah, blah. It didn't take too long for me to start "binge smoking".

In 3 years I was smoking almost 2 packs/day.

I've tried quitting countless times, but whenever I try I can't separete what's my mind and what's the cycle of addiction. I enter a deep confusing state of mind.

I'm smoking 2 cigs/day right now and my head became a hellish place.

I honestly don't know what's worst.

Have someone been trought the same?

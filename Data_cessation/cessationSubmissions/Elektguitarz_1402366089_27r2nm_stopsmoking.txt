I've decided to quit today.

This is the first time I've actually wanted to quit.  I've tried quitting before, but it was more for to see how long I could do it until relapsing.  I went out and bought Nicorette Lozenge.  I also bought toothpicks for oral fixations.  Any other advice would be most helpful.  I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and have read many success stories, I hope to be one too.

i dont post on reddit much... trying to quit smoking however

I guess any comments you leave will be positive reinforcement to me. I'm 25 and have been smoking since I was 18. 

I get the need most after finishing making music (I use Fl Studio), in the morning, or after food.

I tend to spend about $80~ a week on cigarettes, as it is extremely overtaxed and expensive in Australia.

My parents have just helped me by buying me a 80 pack of 4mg Nicabate gum.

Any advice would be great, like how long the worst of the cravings last etc.

Thanks! Feel free to AMA.

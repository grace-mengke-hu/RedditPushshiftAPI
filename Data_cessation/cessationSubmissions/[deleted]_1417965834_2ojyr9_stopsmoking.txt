Still not smoking, but the cruel twist is that as I feel better and happier I want a smoke. WTF.

I am full of energy and feel better than I have felt in a long time. As soon as I start to enjoy that, my brain starts picturing smokes. Brain is being a real prick about it.   

I have been attacking these cravings with chewing gum, but my jaw muscles are actually sore. I am going to look like a pit bull or a Kennedy after all this. I just need a boost here. Thanks for listening.

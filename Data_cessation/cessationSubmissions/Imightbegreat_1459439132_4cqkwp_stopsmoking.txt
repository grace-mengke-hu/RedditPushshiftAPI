Concerned about sputum from smoking

Greetings Reddit,

I've been smoking about a pack a day for 10 or so years and I've been spitting up some sputum that is causing me a considerable amount of concern. I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same and what the problem might be. I'm afraid to go to the doctor as I live in a foreign country and don't quite have a handle on the language yet.

This time it's serious.

Just passed the first 24 hour mark. Long road ahead but I'm feeling positive about it this time! As with everyone I've attempted to quit multiple times, but my whole group of friends are in this time, and I've started reading Allen Carr so I'm feeling good! Struggled last night and was very close to caving but I managed to survive and doing a lot better today!

I think I'm going to miss the habit more than anything though. Everyone here that I've read about have been a driving force and inspiration for me to follow through so thank you everyone and keep at it :-D

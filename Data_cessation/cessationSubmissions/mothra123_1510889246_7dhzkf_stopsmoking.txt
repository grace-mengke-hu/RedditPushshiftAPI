I’m tired

Tired of being unable to breathe when I lay down to go to bed.

Tired of nasty yellow teeth/ smelly breath despite brushing / flossing daily

Tired of having to wash my hands every time I want to pet my cat

Tired of smelling like shit

Tired of being a slave to nicotine and wasting my money. 


I’m 21 hours in and every time a craving hits I remind myself of the things I’m tired of. Wish me luck

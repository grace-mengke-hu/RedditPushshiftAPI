Everybody needs a vice...

I'm a strong believer in the above statement. Smoking was my way of being carefree and reckless, and I am struggling to find an activity that would replicate the feeling. I'm thinking rock-climbing or dirt biking, but neither if those are something I can casually do everyday. 

Any thoughts?

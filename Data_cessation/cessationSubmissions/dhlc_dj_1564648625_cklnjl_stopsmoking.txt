Finally a start after 35 years

Hi i am new here, first hello from Austria. Finally 2 days ago I smoked my last real cigarette after 35 years of heavy smoking 2 or more packages a day. Last year I tried once and after 6 hours had to smoke again. I feel not proud cause I still use vape with nicotine but my health in last day has very much changed. I am really proud to be at least away from the tobacco for the moment and motivated to continue even I crave a lot but never went so far, I hope to continue and later also quit the vape.

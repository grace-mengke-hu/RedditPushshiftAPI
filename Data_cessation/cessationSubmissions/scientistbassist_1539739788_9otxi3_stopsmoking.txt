The "slowing" of time is one good thing about quitting

Typically months will go by at the "speed" of weeks- but not for my last two weeks!  Whatever my mixed feelings on quitting are, I can honestly say that I've truly lived and fully recognized every damn hour to the fullest! In a strange way it is "like" being young again. 

Be good everyone! Not one puff or vape!

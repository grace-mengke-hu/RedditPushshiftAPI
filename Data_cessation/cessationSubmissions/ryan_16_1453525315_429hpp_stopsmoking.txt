unbearable cravings...please talk me out of it

I began a new chapter of my life this week. I cut out my abusive girlfriend, quit smoking, weened off my anxiety meds, and began classes. I have plans to talk to a girl from my class this next week. Things have been going so well but I'm 90% sure I am going to smoke tonight. I felt the same yesterday too but somehow managed to fight it. Please, just...give me anything you have. It's been 3 days and 13 hours now. I don't want to feel like shit tomorrow for fucking up:(

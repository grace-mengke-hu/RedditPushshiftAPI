Quit dates?

Hi all,
I've decided to set a "quit date" for myself in 2 weeks and wondering what everyones thoughts on this approach are? I've tried quitting a few times in the past and I've set quit dates before but never have I gone longer than a day without a cigarette in almost 10 years. 
If you believe in quit dates or they have worked for you, what are some preparations I should make before the day arrives? 
I read 'The Easy Way' by Alan Carr last year but once again only lasted a day with out a cigarette.

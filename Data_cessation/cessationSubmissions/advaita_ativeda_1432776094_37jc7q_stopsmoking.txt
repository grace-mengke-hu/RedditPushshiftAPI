Take 2 Day 2: What should I do differently

Half-a-pack-a-day smoker for 10 years. I was off cigarettes this past April for 20 days but then started  to have a couple of drags from my friends ..I remember telling myself during those intermittent drags that there is no way I will get hooked again because the pain of the first three days was horrible and there is no way I would let myself go through it again. But the couple of drags on weekends changed to half ciggarettes aaaand before I knew it , I bought a pack again 2 weeks ago.  I haven't smoked since Monday and I am going through some major cravings right now so thought I would post here and get some motivation to keep going. People who failed at first quit did you do anything differently the second time around? Any tips/encouragement will be appreciated.

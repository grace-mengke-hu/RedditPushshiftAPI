72 hours ago, at 41 years old, I had a heart attack. Please help me be done!

Luckily I felt something strange and had the fore-site to get to the hospital. I had a stent put in and now they say all is good. I had to listen to a dozen different people tell me that if I don't want this to happen again, I'll never pick up another cigarette.

I'm back home and I don't want to put my family through anything like that again. It's selfish and irresponsible. I've been 72 hours without one and would like to keep going. The urge is pretty damn loud in my head right now, so I thought it might help to write it down somewhere. Is cold turkey a viable option or do I need to go get a patch or gum or something? 

I can not fail!!!

Has anyone gained weight after they quit?

Just like the title says. I was incredibly overweight, I wont say the number, but it was bad. I dropped about 120lbs over the course of 2 years and am still continuing the decline, but after I stopped smoking about 2 months ago, I have put on about 25lbs. I haven't changed anything, same diet, same gym schedule and still gained 25lbs. It is incredibly depressing considering how hard I've worked to lose the weight , and now to see the scale going the wrong way is heartbreaking. Has this happened to anyone else?

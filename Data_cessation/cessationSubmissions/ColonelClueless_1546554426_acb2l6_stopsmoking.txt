Well nicotine is officially out of my body.

I said I'd smash my box of smokes as soon as the ball fell on New Years, and I did. Haven't had a smoke since. According to the smoke free app, my body should no longer have any nicotine in it. Don't intend on going back. There's still a small desire to smoke, but not much. Immediate differences I can see since stopping is the inflammation in my sinuses is much less, making it easier and clearer to breath. I've also noticed a lot more drainage, which I assume is me hacking up all that crap cigarettes put in my body.

14 days without cigarettes, incredible fatigue and insomnia.

How long will withdrawal symptoms last? 

i have been having insomnia (not that bad tho) and very bad fatigue (like chair/bed-bound fatigue)

I have almost no cravings for cigarettes tho, because i really needed to stop to save my life, so the option of smoking does not exist anymore in my mind.

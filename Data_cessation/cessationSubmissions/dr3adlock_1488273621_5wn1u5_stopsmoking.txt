Im 29 and I have smoked every day since I was 16 here I go.

I went to Amsterdam for a stag do this weekend and smoked so much i ruined myself. I got back and my chest felt like it was going to implode, so I'm going to give it another go, this being my 6th or 7th attempt over the past 13 years.

I have been subbed here for the past month and I believe it's you guys talking about it day in and day put that has helped me come to this decision i can actually do it this time so yh cheers.

I am now a quit for life.

I've recently passed 6 months and although that felt amazing, it didn't feel as post worthy as this. I was out drinking tonight and I noticed the packs my friends had out weren't the packs I was used to seeing back when I used to smoke. 

I can say it with confidence now that I was more addicted to flavor than I was to the nicotine (was still addicted to nicotine but priorities :D). Cigarettes in Malaysia were made heavier both in tar and nicotine content and Malaysian Dunhills were amazing. BUT~ what I learnt today is that Dunhill Malaysia is dead. There's no longer the flavor I was hooked to (I know the second hand smell too. It never changed until recent months and confirmed tonight that it was a different thing altogether).

Although I've had no cravings for the last 2 months, this however, was the greatest reinforcement I could ask for. Knowing I won't get that flavor back, I can safely say, I don't care for another smoke until the day I die.  Hoozah~!

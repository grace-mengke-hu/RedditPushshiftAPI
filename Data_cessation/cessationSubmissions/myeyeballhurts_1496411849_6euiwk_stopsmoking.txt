I feel like Ricky Bobby - not sure what to do with my hands.

I got a fidget spinner, it kinda helps a lil, I just feel so fidgety all the time. But its kinda good because my energy has greatly increased. But especially driving, getting use to not smoking while driving is hard, although it is getting better. 

My husband quit too, last week, hes doing great, but he has been extremely tired (he was a harder longer smoker than I was). He gets all antsy and fidgety as well, just so use to like every few hours getting up and going to the garage to smoke. 

We have already saved over $100 since we both quit. That is our biggest motivator (and my state is about to pass another $1.50 per pack tax).

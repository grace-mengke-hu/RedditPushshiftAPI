33 days and going on!!

33 days are a lot of days and I am fully convicend that i'm not going to smoke again.
I think that one of the things that have helped me more it is the mobile app Smoke Free Beta and its missions. Although I completed them at my own pace, I think they are an excellent way to keep me motivated!
Besides thits, the stadistics are very usefull too. Just thinking of reseting them and starting over again made me forget the idea of smoking again.
On the other hand, I have realized how smelly smokers are and I am happy of not being one of them! Sorry if you are and I offended you  but that's what I think now!! Smoking is a smelly habit.

Finally, the thing that helped me the most has been how fast you start noticing the benefits of being a non smoker. Do some soport and you'll realize it!!

I hope all this information help you to quit smoking definitively!!!

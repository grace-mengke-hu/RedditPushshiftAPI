Those Dang Threes

So I did Carr's book and quite cold turkey.  All in all it has been fairly easy; until this weekend.  I had, and am having more craves than I had the first three weeks combined.  I am also going thru depression.  So odd.  I don't want to smoke, and will not, but it sucks feeling this way after doing so well the first three weeks.

Send me some good vibes.  I need it.

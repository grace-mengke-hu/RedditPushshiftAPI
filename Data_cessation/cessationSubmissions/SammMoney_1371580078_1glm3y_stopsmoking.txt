I'm doing it again: Next Sunday the 30th is my planned quit day.

I'm going to the doc to pick up a prescription to Chantix again Thursday and I'll start taking it on Sunday.  May even start a bit sooner since I have pills left over from the last time I stopped smoking.  My fiance and I just had a little one and Monday July 1st he'll be two months old.  Lost my mom 6 years ago to lung cancer, you would have thought it would scare me enough to quit.  I keep thinking about my son and how I don't want him to go through what I went through.  I hope you guys don't mind if I make posts just want to talk about my progress.  Others around me don't seem to understand what I go through when I quit.  Here's the the future.

A blessing in disguise

A few weeks ago, I read Allen Carr's book and it helped me set my mind in the right direction. I stopped smoking cold turkey.

I quit effortlessly. It felt like a total liberation. The physical aspect, the nicotine withdrawal, was the more visible aspect of the process. However I barely felt it.

I managed to avoid all the triggers I knew I had. Those first weeks almost felt like I had a personality disorder. I was a better version of myself, both mentally and physically. Everything was easier.

This weekend, I made a mistake. I was confortable with who I was and certain of my new life. 

Over confidence made me take a drag on a spliff. It's not a cigarette, I am having fun with my friend and I can manage. 

I was wrong. The old habit kicked in. Monday has past and straight out of the office I bought a pack.

I smoked one. I smoked two.

I feel nauseated, my whole body stink, I have an headache, my mouth taste like I just licked an ashtray.

I craved for a cigarette but it made me sick right away.

I realise that I am an addict. I can not take one drag and go away with it. This is an blessing in disguise. I know have all the information I need to stop forever.

I hate being a smoker. I am not this person anymore.

You smoked. You relapsed. That is fine. You will quit again and for good. Because you know you hate it and you are not this person anymore.

Thank you for reading this and I hope it can help you.

What are the things you replaced smoking breaks with?

Hello, internet.

I decided to quit today. I figured out I shouldn't wait for a day when I feel ready, because such a day never comes.

I want to ask you, those who quit or those who are currently trying to do it, what have you replaced your smoking breaks with? They are very precious to me and it's one of my main issues. 

Smoke breaks with my mom and friends used to be the times when we bonded the most. I also like to have that time for myself when I'm doing work and I want a break and some peace. I'm looking for your help and your ideas on what should I replace that with. 

Thank you! :)

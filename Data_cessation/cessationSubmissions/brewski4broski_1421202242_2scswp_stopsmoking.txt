359 Days being a non smoker

So I never really kept track of the date I stopped. You know most people have an app counter, or something like that. Not me. I didn't want to keep track of it, I wanted to just move forward with the rest of my life. 

I do keep a journal of my life, especially when life is really shitty or really good, so I can go back & read over how I was that day. Around a year ago I started working out, and had posted some "before" pics, of when I was fat, so I was trying to locate them. I came across a post on January 19th, 2014 that read "I am officially smoke free" and it was that day that I had stopped.

So as of now i'm 359 days smoke free. Some people would say it's hard, but it hasn't been. It's been super easy for me. I just don't think about it. If I do think about it, I think about how much happier I am now than I was before. How much healthier I am now. How much I enjoy life more. I don't need to wait until 365 to make a post like this, because there really is no need to.

If you have just stopped smoking, or are planning on it, I suggest you kick the habit now. That way a year (less a week) from now, you can also be happier than you've ever been.

Best of luck to all of you who are thinking about it, or just starting to stop, or are having a hard time. If you're having a hard time, it does get easier!

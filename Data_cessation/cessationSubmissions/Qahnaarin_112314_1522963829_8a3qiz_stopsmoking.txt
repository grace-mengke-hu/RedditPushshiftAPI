Luke warm white vinegar gets smoke stains off walls! No joke!

Even after my husband and I began smoking inside for a month there were stains that wouldn't come out of the walls. It was extremely disheartening and we gave up on it. After 2.5 years of smoking inside I tried something weird and it freakin worked!

White vinegar (not diluted), warm it up in the microwave to about bath temperature, get a rag and ring it out. Wipe down your walls with very little elbow grease needed (I'm a small weakling that can't even do 2 push ups for reference lol). Start at the bottom to avoid streaks. It being warm is very essential. Change it out once it gets dirty. I suggest a lighter color rag so you know when you need a new one.

My walls went from a beige back to the pretty light blue/ gray. I could cry tears of joy. And it was easier and more effective than those pricey magic erasers. I hope this post can help someone leave the "scars" on their home behind as we all work to move forward to a smoke free life! :)

How do you deal with the post-quitting sickness/discomfort?

I smoked menthols for a few years, and I've recently tried to quit. My throat aches, my head hurts and I feel achy like I have the flu. I know this is all normal, but do any of you have suggestions for how you got through this part? This is often when I relapse. Thanks!

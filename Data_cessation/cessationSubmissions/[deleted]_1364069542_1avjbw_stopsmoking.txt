Is it possible to crave cigarettes after only a couple? How can I keep myself away?

My whole life I've LOVED the smell of second hand smoke. Then finally I tried it two days ago and it was way, way too good. Now I'm really struggling to keep myself away. I threw the pack I bought but it's just so hard to pass by convenience stores and not buy some, especially when I'm stressed out. What should I do to avoid caving in a moment of weakness? I really don't think I'd be able to do it casually (once every couple of days or something), I'd probably get addicted within a very short time. Help me, please.

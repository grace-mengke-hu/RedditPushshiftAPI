41 days free from smoking :)

I keep working out like crazy and my appetite is very healthy and strong :D

Sometimes I still get the urge to smoke but it is not do or die. The urge goes away.

 However, I can tell you from past experience that if I stop working out it is a matter of time before I go back to smoking.

Just started reading Allen Carr's "Easy Way"

Ignore my flair, it is not accurate. I'm a smoker, an addict, and I started reading Allen Carr's book and holy crap--I am seeing things clearly already. I'm only on Chapter 13 and I'm realizing these little things about me that seemed totally normal before. 

Just a funny moment: Carr was explaining how smokers can't be truly relaxed. 
>You'll find that they have their hands near their mouths, or they are twiddling
their thumbs, or tapping their feet, or fiddling with their hair, or clenching their jaw.

The moment I read that, I realized that I had my fingers to my mouth and I was tapping my feet against the bottom of my desk. 
He caught me. 

I'll be updating my flair the moment I finish this book. Until then, back to reading.

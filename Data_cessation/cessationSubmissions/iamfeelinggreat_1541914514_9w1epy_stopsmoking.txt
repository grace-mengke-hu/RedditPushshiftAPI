Going Cold Turkey Today (Cig &amp; Coffee)

So, I was planning all these stuffs. I have to quit smoking now. I am smoking more than a 20-25 pcs a day. I need to buy a pack every day. I also drink around 7-8 cups of black coffee (Don't know its good or bad).

&amp;#x200B;

It has been 7 hours already plus the 2 hours of napping. So any tips and advice ???

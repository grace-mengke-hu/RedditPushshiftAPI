How to quit smoking in a high stress environment?

I am a supervisor / line cook in a high volume fast-paced restaurant and everyone I work with smokes. In a single shift I tend to smoke a full pack of cigarettes (25 here in canada).

Has anyone out there ever manage to quit in such a high volume place (~180 seats) without losing their job?

It's a stressful environment and when I close (4 nights a week), it's dead and I get bored and tend to smoke *even more*.

I want to quit, but I'm not sure how to manage the stress without getting in people's faces (and can't afford the time off).

I'm looking for advice.

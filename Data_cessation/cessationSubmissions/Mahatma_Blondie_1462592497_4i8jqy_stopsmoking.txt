It's been over two years and I'm craving worse than week one.

Why. Wtf. I've had so many good days. So many times I've thanked god that I'm not that poor bastard over there hacking a lung up. Maybe it's the moderate increase in stress but I've been thinking about it almost constantly for what seems like the past month. I used to fucking love cigarettes. Now I'm not sure what I want. I feel like honoring what I want and not whats expected of me. Does anyone have advise for hard cravings late in the game?

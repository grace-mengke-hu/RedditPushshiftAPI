I'm very sick for the first time since quitting. Is my bad habit making it worse?

I recently came down with a sinus infection and feels so much worse and has lasted longer than any other one I've had. I usually get them 2-3x a year but after day 2 or 3 the major symptoms are usually much better. I've been sick for 5 days now and I'm not getting better at a noticeable rate. I went to a doctor and I've been on an antibiotic but I expected faster progress. Could my old habit be catching up with me now? I had the "quitter's flu" when I first stopped  but haven't really experienced this severe of coughing since I quit. I was just wondering if this is normal or if I should head back again to the doctor.

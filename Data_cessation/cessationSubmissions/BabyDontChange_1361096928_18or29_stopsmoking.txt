Well, day 1 again, ready for 3 days of hell!!

I quit for 3 months back in september, not a single puff.  Buuuuuuut I caved for some stupid reason.  I know my mistake and how to avoid it and am ready to give it up for good.  This sub reddit and badge and support, while in a way meaningless, really helped me in a few ways last time, so I'm back and ready to be freeeeeeeeee!

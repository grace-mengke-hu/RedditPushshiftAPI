Day 3 - I'm starting to smell things!

I noticed it this morning - walking into work and the car park smells different - my office smells different - Sure this is going to be good and bad but very happy after a long time to have this come back.  Its like 26 years ago I stopped smelling things properly and its finally getting fixed.So cool.  Going walking at lunch to try this new sense out :)

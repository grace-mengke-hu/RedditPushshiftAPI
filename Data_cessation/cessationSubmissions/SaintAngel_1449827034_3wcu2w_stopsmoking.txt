As of right now I'm more than seven days smoke free.

The last time I had a cigarette was last Thursday.  Its officially Friday. 

Maybe I had a nicotine mint to help out since then, but it wasn't in excess.  Tonight was the hardest part, the real test, on how committed I am to quitting. 

My sister texted me in the middle of the night tonight, having no reason to do so other than her having a 'weird feeling.'  She asked if everything was okay and apologized for texting so late.  I decided to tell her the truth:  That I'm quitting smoking, and that tonight was really upsetting. It made me want to smoke, and that me choosing not to was seriously affecting me. 

She called me and was I able to verbally experience some things I haven't yet dealt with without an emotional crutch like smoking. 

It's been seven days!

I guess as a post script, I'll add that I'm putting on some serious weight now that I've stopped smoking.  Oral fixations man ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

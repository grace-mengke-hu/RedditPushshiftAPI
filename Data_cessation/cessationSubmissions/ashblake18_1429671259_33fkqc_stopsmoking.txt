At what point will I stop wanting a cigarette every 5 minutes? Any useful tips or tricks you guys use to distract yourself? Help is deeply appreciated. I'm scared to death. 6 hours smoke free.... (I've got to start somewhere)

I am a 12 year 1-2 packs a day smoker. This is hard. I know you feel my pain...

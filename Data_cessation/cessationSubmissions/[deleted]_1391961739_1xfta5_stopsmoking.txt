I have a horrible wound

Long ago, I scratched and I got this wound. It'd have healed but I kept itching. More I scratched, the worse the itching got. My insistent itching made my wound deep and wide. Soon it took over a lot of my mental space and took it's toll on my body. Every time I had any problem or I got stressed or I got bored, I scratched. It was a nice momentary relief from the pain that the wound caused. I thought one day the itching would stop or the wound will heal and I won't have to scratch anymore. 

I'm an idiot for not realizing that the wound won't heal till I stop scratching. If I don't stop scratching, my health and my peace of mind will not return. I don't have the mind space for it anymore. I'll need to stop scratching. Sure it'll be weird the first few days, itching will be annoying, wound will take time to heal. But there's no other way. I'll not scratch anymore. Soon the body will repair itself. Instead of a gaping wound, I'll have a scar. I'll wear the scar with pride. It'll be a nice reminder of exercise in futility. At least, chicks dig scars. I'll share my war stories and tales of my battle wound. And keep it in my mind, "Don't scratch. Not. Even. Once."

Here's to healing the wounds....

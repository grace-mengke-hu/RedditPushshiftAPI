Creating cognitive dissonance

This is something that I have found has helped me in the past and I am trying to use to full potential this time around.  The idea of cognitive dissonance is to create discomfort due to conflicting attitudes or behaviours.  I have had people in the past say to me that they were surprised that I smoked because I seemed to have such "healthy" habits otherwise.  That always made me feel really foolish and ashamed for smoking but not enough to really do anything about it.

This time though I am trying to really focus on the healthy stuff with the hope that me doing a 30 day fitness challenge and eating well for example will really clash with the habit of smoking.  I think that if you change other behaviours to become a "healthy" person, the "smoker" identity will not really fit any more.  I don't think that this has to be a HUGE change but even small things like becoming more active, eating better, or drinking less could help.  Thought I would share as so far it has been helping me, especially exercising!  So nice to be out of breath and not automatically worry that there is something wrong with your lungs, but rather they are just working to their potential!

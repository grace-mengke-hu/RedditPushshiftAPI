I tried cold turkey today. Nearly ended in complete disaster.

Hey all,

I ran out of my nicotine spray last night and decided today is the day I go cold turkey. I lasted about 5 hours.

The good news, I didn't touch a cigarette. The bad news, I had to go buy another spray. I thought I was ready to stop the spray, but it seems I'm not.

Woke up feeling fine. Took the little one to school, got back and I just couldn't focus properly on anything. My head had this buzzing feeling. Everything agitated me. Life felt flat to the point where I just lay on the floor staring at the wall for well over an hour.

The car outside that was left running for 5 minutes wound me up. My girlfriends music whilst she cleaned sounded like a broken record and was eating away at me. We argued a lot this morning over silly things. Ended up in a heated argument and I walked out and told her I'm leaving. I just felt so low it was unreal.

Now I'm back home, with my spray, I feel normal again. I'm left with the aftermath of the arguments to deal with.

Why is it so hard? I never remember it being like this before.

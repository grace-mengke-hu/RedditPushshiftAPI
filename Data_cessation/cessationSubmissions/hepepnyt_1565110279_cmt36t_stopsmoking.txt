Tomorow I am going to quit for good after 10 years of smoking

Hello, I am going to give myself present for my 30 birthday as I told myself long time ago I will quit either then or never. Smoking for almost 10 years, last year only IQOS for about 18 cigarets a day.

Once I was able to quit for almost year, so I know there is life after as non smoker. But what scares me are those first days and weeks, they are hardest. I used to smoke everywhere, in work, on walks, at disco, at pub, at home in front of computer. I can't imagine how could I not smoke on those places from tomorow and what to do instead. How to get something as sensational as smoking. 

I am quitting mostly because of health and money. Each month I will put away same amount of money I smoked to saving account. 

I don't have much in my plan for quitting. Maybe do more sport or meditate during worst cravings.

This sub is one of best, reading all your stories while I struggle with my own. Wish me luck

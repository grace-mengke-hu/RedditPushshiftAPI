constant cold after quitting smoking

So its been four months since I quit. My health is much better now. All the coughing is gone, but I have had this constant cold for a month or so now where my nose continues to drip constantly and I have to keep on blowing the nose. Along with that I have to sneeze quit a bit too. I don't think its real cold. Just smoking related issues. Earlier I had a lot of coughing, but that is gone now, but I still have these cold like symptoms after 4 months.

This is pretty much the last remaining side-effect of me quitting smoking after 25 years of pack a day. Hopefully it will be gone soon and then I will be in great health.

Wondering if anyone has experienced constant cold after quitting smoking and how long it lasted?

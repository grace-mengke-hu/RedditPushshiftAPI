50 days smoke free today, but I'm not happy

This is the longest quit ever and something I've always wanted to do.

Cravings are still there maybe 3-4 each day but they are manageable. I don't think a lot about smoking and sometimes it surprises me that I've gone so far in the day without thinking about it.

This is all good but there's one big problem - I'm not happy. Quitting smoking is all what I wanted to do while smoking. But now, when I'm there, I don't know why I am not happy about it. 

During my earlier quits, I was happy and excited; I used to wake up every morning thankful for another smoke free day that went by. All that's not there this time. I haven't done anything different this time compared to my earlier attempts, I don't know why is this happening.

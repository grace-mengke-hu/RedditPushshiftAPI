Making Headway To Quitting.

It's only been today (have had two cigarettes, smoke rollies), but it's been building up for a while, sick of headaches, sore throats - you know the deal.
Currently reading Allen Carr's Guide To Quitting and it's helping immensely, my second cigarette tasted like arse.  Just needing a bit of help as with work & school atm it's a big social breakup, morning breaks involve a ciggy, lunch involves a ciggy - and I was wondering if anyone has any hints as to how to not to slip back during these times.  

I've only been smoking for a few years, i'm nearly 21 and started when I was 16-17 and tried to quit inbetween and it was miserable, every time I went out I was desperate to scab anything off people around me.  I don't want it to be another one of those situations.  Please help!

9 Days..

It has been 9 days since I smoked my last cigarette and, wow, it feels really, really good. The cravings are powerful and come on without much warning but the ability to wake up the next day knowing that I was strong enough to resist temptation far outweighs any withdrawal pang. I was a consistent half-a-pack a day smoker for 11 years and I at times doubted if I could ever bring myself to stop. This isn't my first time trying to quit but it certainly feels like the RIGHT time - thank you all for being here in this support group, I've been lurking for a few weeks and I've truly taken some of your stories and struggles and triumphs as inspiration and just wanted to extend some gratitude!

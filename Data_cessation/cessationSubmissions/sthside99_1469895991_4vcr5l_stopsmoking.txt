Drinking alcohol after you have quit

Hey guys,
So I'm currently on day 3 and it's going a lot better than I thought. Using the patches and feel really motivated.. I can finally see myself as being a non smoker and I feel okay with that but taking it day by day. The only thing I'm nervous about is drinking alcohol. I have a night out planned on the 5th of August which will only be within my two week stage of quitting and even though I honestly do believe myself that I won't smoke when I'm drunk there's a tiny hint of uncertainty and when I'm drunk I do not make good decisions. Plus a lot of the people I'm going out with smoke. Has anyone had this problem and do you have any advice? I was thinking of seeing how the cravings go leading up to it but as I said when I'm drunk I'm not sure if I'll have any will power, I also had never planned for my new lifestyle of a non smoker to be a non drinker so I would still like to be able to go out and drink without smoking but is it too soon? and if so how long should I wait?

Thanks in advancw for all the help this sub has really been great in distracting me from cravings!

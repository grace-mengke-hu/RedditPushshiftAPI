1 month 8 day slip up

1 month 8 days. I drank too much yesterday and had 2 cigarettes. I don’t ever want to do that again. I logged it in my smoking app but did not restart my quit date. I’m feeling guilty for not resetting the counter like I’m a cheat. But if I reset I’ll restart smoking, I feel. So here’s my confession but I’m still going as a non smoker.

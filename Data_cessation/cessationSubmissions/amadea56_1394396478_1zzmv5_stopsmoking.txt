After 581 days of not-smoking, I am back to 0. :-(

Important to remind myself not to get careless. In the past, I have always been able to stop smoking but after sometime I convince myself it will be alright if I just do it once and I fall back into it. I realize it is because I think of it as a reward or something I need when I am facing a lot of stress, which is what happened this morning. I feel like if I can stop thinking of it as a 'reward' and I 'deserve' it for not smoking for quite some time. I realize they are disgusting and always disappoint. Sorry for my rambling, just relapsed and am emotional but I just needed to get it out and I figured here would be the right place.

TL;DR- Me rambling about how I relapsed.

miss smoking so much, need advice

Hi all. I have been looking at this subreddit for about a week since the Smoke Free app guided me to it and I'm finally feeling brave enough to post/ask for advice.

I have smoked for 20 years with large chunks of time away from it. The first time I quit lasted more than four years. And since then I have quit for a year, months or weeks at a time.

I started smoking yet again in late 2016. I have made MULTIPLE attempts to stop since May 2017 (probably once a month at varying lengths). And have been smoke free now for 9 days, 22 hours and 58 minutes.

What is bugging me now, more than ever, is the extent to which I miss smoking on an emotional level. I miss it so much to the point that I cried twice yesterday and am choking up now just thinking about it. Even though I have quit so many times I have never, ever felt like this. It's like I broke up with someone and all I can remember now are the good things from the relationship.

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what they did about it?

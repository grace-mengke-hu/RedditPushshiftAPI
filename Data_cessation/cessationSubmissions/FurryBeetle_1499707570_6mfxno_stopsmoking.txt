So many different emotions after being being on nicotine patch for a week , is this normal?

I've been smoking for 17 years. In the last 5 years I have quit 3 times for 8-12 months at a time ( or something like that) by means of vaping with nicotine. It was very easy to stop smoking cigarettes this way. 

This time I am using the patch and I feel I'm going crazy. The first few days I smoked a few cigs and it was fine. Then I had 2 days of no cigs and it was fine. 

Then yesterday I had some family stress and it seems it triggered something. I was so angry towards towards my family. Now since then I just feel angry, mad and sad at everyone and everything. 
I'm also very anxious. I bought a pack last night and have had 2 smokes. 

Is this normal? Any advice?

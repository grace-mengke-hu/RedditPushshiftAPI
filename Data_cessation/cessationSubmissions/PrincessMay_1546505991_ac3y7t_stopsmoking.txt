Drinking coffee after you quit.

I’ve noticed in a few posts and from my own experience that after quitting, there is an increase of drinking coffee.

I used to be fine with one cup per day, now I’m onto 5-6 cups per day! Not that I’m upset but I’ve just seen a trend. 

Anyone else increase their coffee intake or know why?

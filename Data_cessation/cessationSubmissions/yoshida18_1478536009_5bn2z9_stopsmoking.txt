smoke since 16 ( 22 M) and feel completly addicted

Hello guys, i am a pretty anxious person and made the shit decision to start smoking on my teens. I smoked regular cigarrets for about an year getting up to 1 pack a day. i than changed to rolling up my tobacco because its so much cheaper and i acctually ended up smoking "less". in 2014 i made a resolution to stop smoking at least for an year to check if i can control the adiction, spent one year not buying cigarrets and smoking like 2 times a month on bars and it went smootly, no cravings ( at least sober ) and began smoking again in 2015 thinking i could control it

thing is, since mid june im in a depression crisis feeling as anxious as all hell ( i take medication ) and my smoking skyrocketed, last two weeks i smoked a can of 80grams of tobbaco ( high tobacco golden virginia ). i feel cravings all the time and i cant think of anything else until i get my fix,today i woke up craving for a cigar, went there to smoke and just coudnt, my troat is just to fucked up and when i finished the craving came back again. i keep telling me its only until i get out of this chrisis but its becoming out of control

just the tought of quiting like i did in 2014 scares the shit out of me, i pretend to buy nicotine patches ( wish i could aford e-cigs here in brasil ) today to help with the cravings and try to smoke less, i feel im in a point that it will only get worse and worse

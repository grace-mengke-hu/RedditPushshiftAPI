Quitting today !!

Today is definitely my last day smoking. My motivation is to keep my ass alive so I can watch my family grow and after seeing a few posts here and advice I feel really good about this.   
I'm going to avoid e-cig all together because I don't want a substitute I want to end the cravings and "needs" of cigs.    
I'm going with 6 things    
1 - Pack of gum  
2 - Toothpicks  
3 - Gallon jug of water per day   
4 - Exercise   
5 - Avoiding triggers   
6 - /r/stopsmoking   
I'll try to document cravings, triggers and 2nd hand smoke.   
I eat healthy and workout but because of my smoking I've completely given up on cardio; so I have a few things to work on and keep myself busy during the first week.   
Wish me luck !

Been off the smokes 1 week today - woohoo!!

Which for me (been known to some family members as 'Fag Ash' in the past, referring to me constantly having a cigarette in my mouth) is just pretty incredible!!  Well proud of myself!

Decided I need to start exercising along side quitting, so for my 1 week non-smoker anniversary, I dragged myself down the gym early doors this morning too, which surprisingly felt pretty damn good.  So all in all, having a really good week thus far.  I know I shouldn't get too ahead of myself with it only being a week, but ya know, it feels so good that I wanna scream it from the rooftops!!

Wishing all you other fellow quitters the same good feeling.

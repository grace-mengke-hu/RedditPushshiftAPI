I keep going back to cigarettes.

Last year, I told myself I’d quit smoking by 2019, the new year specifically. I told myself it’ll be different this time because it would be like turning over a new leaf. It would be the start of a new year and the timing would be perfect. 

I made it 10 days but I smoked again at a party I went to. Since then, I’ve been smoking again everyday. I always found reasons for it. Tough day at work? I’ll have a cigarette. Great day at work? I’ll celebrate with a smoke. I’m meeting up with a friend and I’ll have a cigarette while I’m at it. Some of my co-workers also smoke and I can’t resist it when they invite me for a smoke break.

How do I stop this? I see all the progress made by people on this sub and I really wanna be one of them. I look at smoking as something to take the edge off. I smoke when I wanna calm down, in the mornings to sort of prep me for the day. My urges are completely out of control. If I have one in the morning and think about having one later in the day, I’d reason out “I already had one today so what’s the difference? I’ll try again tomorrow.” It’s that sort of mindset that sets me back. Please help me break that line of thinking.

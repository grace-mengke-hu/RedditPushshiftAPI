Had a funny moment this morning. (NYC)

I was getting off the 7 train at 34th St. There are two escalators that one has to take to the surface. Anyway, usually I bolt up these escalators, which is a task since you're several stories underground. I decided to take my time this morning--as I was waiting off to the side a dude ran past me to get up. I leisurely walked up the rest of the way as spaces opened up, then briskly walked up the second escalator. 

When I emerge on the surface, I saw the same guy, panting, but also lighting up. I couldn't help but chuckle because I remembered the feeling, but simultaneously remembered the futility--like speeding to a red light or something. This poor guy was rushing to get his fix. The need to smoke was dictating his behavior, and it's something I'm very glad I'm rid of.

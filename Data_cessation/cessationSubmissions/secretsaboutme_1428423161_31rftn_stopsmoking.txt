I Quit on Saturday, for the second time, scared but excited.

I'm nervous. I read Alan Carr's Easyway several years ago and quit for about three years. It worked like a dream, and it was easy. Exactly what everyone says about "The Book". 

Then I had a drag of someone's clove cigarette and over the next year and a half it was all down hill and I became a full fledged smoker again. 

Does anyone have advice about quitting again after falling off the wagon after reading the easyway? I still believe everything I read in the book, but worried that the "magic" is gone the second time around.  I had tried reading it again several times but wasn't mentally there. I think this time I am, and it was weird -- the night after I quit smoking this time, I kept on waking up in the middle of the night and the first thought that kept popping in my head was "i'm a non-smoker" I hope that was some kind of sign, that I'm finally ready this time. 

Smoking was really messing with my life. I was living in a constant state of guilt, trying to hide it from certain people, leaving early from hanging with friends that didn't know how much I smoked so I could go smoke, to use it to procrastinate -- all while hating myself for slipping back into it again. 

By the way, for those of you that have read Alan Carr's "Easyway" his warning at the end is so very true: do not EVER have any form of nicotine again. I was so adamantly quit and happy about it -- it took a while but I found myself smoking again. I can hardly believe it happened.

Anyway, wish me luck!

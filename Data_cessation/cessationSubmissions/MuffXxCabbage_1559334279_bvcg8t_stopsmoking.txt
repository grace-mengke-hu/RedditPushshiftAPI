long time lurker, yesterday marked me one year smoke free

wow this is crazy! 366 days ago i had a really bad chest cold and decided not to smoke until my lungs got better. a few days later i thought id keep the ball rolling for as long as i could, and now here i am a year later! it was hard. the first 5 months were mostly fine, but month 6 was the most fucking difficult part of my quit. i had no idea that the quitting process  was  still going to haunt me 6 months later... but i pushed through it and now i feel great! sometimes i think to myself that i'd like to have a cigarette, but i never regret quitting. if you're quitting, commit to the quit fam. it may be difficult (and you may get blindsided a few months down the line), but i promise if you keep on pushing through it does get easier. have a great day

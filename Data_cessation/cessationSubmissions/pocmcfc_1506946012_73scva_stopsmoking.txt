50 days in and it's not getting any easier

I'm finding that I'm not really craving cigarettes that much, but I'm still getting craving symptoms. The headaches, the irritability and just generally feeling like a deep fried turd. 

Part of it may be due to my gf currently going through some personal issues that are impacting on me.

Is this going to get any easier? I've been telling myself it'll get easier every other day or so for the last 50.

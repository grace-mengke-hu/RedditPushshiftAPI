A year has passed.

This go around I abstained completely from all nicotine.    I'm grateful.  I still have cravings, but they are fewer and further between.   Usually these lusts for a smoke are abated through a couple deep breaths, breaths that I could not take a year ago. I'm stoked on it.  I hope everyone in this sub is successful in their cessation.     

This time I'm not going to relapse for a chick.

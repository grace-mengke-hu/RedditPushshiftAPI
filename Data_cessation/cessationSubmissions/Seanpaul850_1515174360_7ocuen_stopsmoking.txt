Need some help

So long story short me and my lady quit together and I can tell I have a lot more self control than she does. I feel like she is going to crack and smoke behind my back. This is her first time quitting after smoking for 10 years. 

What can I do to help her. We downloaded a rewarding quitting app. We have monthly date rewards and I encourage her the most I can. But in the end she is acting like sheâ€™s going to smoke any day now.

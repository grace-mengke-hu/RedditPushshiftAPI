Motivation for people who (are about to) quit and work out/run.

After 12 years of smoking I recently quit (1 month ago, cold turkey) while I just started to go to the gym again. I always do some resistance training and finish with a 45 minute run (last 20 minutes of these are interval sprints) on the treadmill. I have to say that immediately after the first day (when I quit and did those sprints), my "breathing-recoverytime" after each sprint was reduced drastically (I sprint 35 seconds on max effort then rest 1:25). 
Where it normally takes around 40-50 seconds for me to regain stable breathing after each sprint it now takes 10-15 seconds.
THIS difference was for me the biggest factor to STAY AWAY from smoking.
Now that I am a full month further I increased the incline + speed on the whole HIIT sprint session, plus I increased even the "resting paces" and it still goes amazing and most important of all, I'm feeling great.
I'd suggest anyone who does any type of sports or thinks about being active, just quit and feel the difference in breathing! 
The progress, how fast or slow it may be, will be a huge motivator for you and it has a great distraction to stay away from the cigarettes!
Hope this message inspires/motivates anyone and best of luck to every one of you!

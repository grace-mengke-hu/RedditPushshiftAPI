My advice on cold turkey

So I went cold turkey on Jan 1st 2016. So far its working for me. I smoked 20 to 25 smokes a day. I felt terrible. I'm 37 years old and I had enough. The way I went into it was like this.

1. Dont worry about weight gain. I allowed myself to eat like crap the first week
2. Dont worry about stressing or being angry the people around you will just need to deal.
3. I said to myself "i'm not going to let somthing like a cigarette control me anymore."
4. Everytime ive wanted one or thought about it or had a bad craving. I've pinched myself really hard on my arm.
5. If you have kids or even a wife sit back and think "do i want to die young, do I want to set a good example for them..

Well these are the things ive done so far. I know it hasnt been long and im not out of the woods but i think i finally want tot quit and not just doing it "because"

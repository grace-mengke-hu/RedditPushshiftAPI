Strategies?

I've tried quitting before, with varying success, but I always ultimately ended up smoking again. This time I tried something different. I bought a 6 pack of lozenges, so i'd never run out of them. I also still carried my pack of American Spirit Menthol Lights and a lighter with me in my "Man Purse" 
When I felt a craving I asked myself would I rather have a lozenge that tastes like absolute shit and burns my mouth, or would I rather throw all the progress I've made away for an even more disgusting cigarette?

It became easy, I had always had one last cigarette or some dumb distraction to delay things. This time I just said no, and popped one of those gross lozenges, and slowly my smell came back, and I could taste again. Things are looking up. I have the pack in my bag still, and haven't had a craving or taken a lozenge in 4 days.

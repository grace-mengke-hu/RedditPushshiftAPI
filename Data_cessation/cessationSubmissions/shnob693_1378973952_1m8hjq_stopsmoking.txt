Step into the unknown

Well, im going for it again. Had my last one and I already miss it. Kinda. I'm excited to see where this is going. Im also excited to be able to climb without being short of breath two steps in. 

Just decided to search for this sub after my last one, so hopefully the encouragement can help. I'll check in every once in a while. If I can do this, I know I can beat my porn addiction too. So im excited for a whole new me!

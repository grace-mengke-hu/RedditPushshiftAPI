Quiting nicotine tomorrow

Laying in bed at the moment and feel terrible about my past choices leading to my existing nicotine addiction. Tomorrow is the start of a new life, a life without nicotine. Not only will I spare some money, I’ll also spare my own health, my own well-being. I’m happy to join this community and feel like at least giving this a shot. I’ve been using nicotine almost every day for a year and a half now, but it’s time to change. Good night my fellow quitters, see ya with and update tomorrow.

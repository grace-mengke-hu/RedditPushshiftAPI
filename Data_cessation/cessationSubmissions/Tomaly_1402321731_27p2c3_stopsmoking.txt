Dealing with frustration/agitation

I'm 4 days without a cigarette and as you guys know it's really freaking hard. I know I can do it this time, but I'm having a bit of an issue trying to quit this time. When I get cravings I become irritable and pissy as hell. I know with time these feelings will go away, but in the meantime I'm pushing the people close to me away with my annoying attitude, especially my girlfriend. That is unacceptable and I could use some help. How do you guys manage to remain calm and not take out your frustration on others?

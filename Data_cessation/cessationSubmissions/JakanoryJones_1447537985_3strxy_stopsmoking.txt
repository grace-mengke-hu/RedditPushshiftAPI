On my 4th day. Just had the worst craving ever!

I just went to make a cuppa and I was having the biggest inner monologue fight with myself ever. Nearly quit quitting.

Sometimes it's super easy, like my first day at my new job was today and I went with everyone to smoke but it didn't bother me too much being around them, but just now I could have smoked about 8.

Also I have like an hour and a half trip to work so that is annoying as fudge. Wanted to punch all of the people when I got back.

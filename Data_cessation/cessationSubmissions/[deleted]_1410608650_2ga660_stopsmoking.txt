23/f contemplating quitting - help plz

It's my first post on here so please forgive me if I ramble a little. 

I've been smoking for the last few years, admittedly progressively more as time has gone past. I rarely drink, I have a high pressure job and honestly I have always kind of said smoking is my one crutch that gets me through the day without my head exploding. 

Like some others I have read about, I have tried to keep my smoking on the down low. I currently live with my sister while my partner works overseas (he also smokes - but we can delve into that later) so I don't smoke at home. But tonight she sends me a text message that actually made me want to quit right this second and never look back. 

Basically she said that she didn't want to start an argument and it's my life/choice bla bla but she wants me to know she wants me to quit and will help any way possible if I decide that's what I want. And that she had done some research and there were a lot options for me. A lot of other stuff was mentioned but it was the first time I really felt selfish and disgusting for having this habit. 

A few hours later, and I'm still thinking about it. So I thought I'd write a list;

Why I want to quit:
General health
General reputation 
My car smells like an ashtray 
$$$
Time wasting 
I probably smell like an ashtray at times 
Approaching baby making time 

Why I don't want to quit: 
I don't know how to deal with my job without it
I actually enjoy smoking 
My partner smokes 
I'm afraid of failing miserably 
I don't want to get fat  

I hate that a habit I have has played on my sisters mind so much she felt the need to do that. But at the same time I don't want to try to quit if I'm not really ready. 

How do I know if I'm ready!?

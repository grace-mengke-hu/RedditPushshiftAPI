Any tips for starting the patch?

I set my quit date as Jan. 1st. I failed. I got a bad cold and stayed in bed all day, and smoked a cigarette as soon as I could breathe enough to do so. 

My reddit secret santa got me a 28 day supply of the patch. I am going to start tomorrow because a lit cigarette but almost set the back seat of my car on fire tonight. 

Does anyone have any tips? I realize that I can't do this on my own. I have not been vigilant enough to keep posting to this subreddit.

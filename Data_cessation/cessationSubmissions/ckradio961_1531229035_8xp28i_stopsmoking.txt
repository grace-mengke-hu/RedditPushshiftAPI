Day 65 and losing it.

Is this “extinction burst?” 65 days since last smoke, 24 days with zero nicotine in my body (used patch for first bit).

The last couple weeks have been a roller coaster craving wise. I didn’t realize at the time stepping that down to no nicotine would make me an asshole at first (ask my wife). Then I felt like I had it beat. Then I didn’t and then I did again. Now for some reason today, randomly, I’m trying to convince myself that maybe I’m just a smoker and that’s ok. Or maybe i should just vape, even though I’ve always thought it was lame. All these feelings are ridiculous, and frankly, kind of piss me off.

I’m supposed to be writing something. I had a deadline for the end of June. I’m nowhere close to finished. I just can’t concentrate and I’m not putting out near my best stuff lately. So of course I use this as an excuse to say “oh, you’re better when you’re smoking.” Again... ridiculous.

Anyone else have this insanely strong urge to cave around this point?

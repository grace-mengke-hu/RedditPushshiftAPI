Day 4 and the insomnia is real. I can breathe again though.

I am exhausted, and the only way I have been able to fall asleap these last few days is by essentially passing out. This is not fun but I am really proud of my progress. I can breathe again. Really deep wonderful breaths and it is worth it.

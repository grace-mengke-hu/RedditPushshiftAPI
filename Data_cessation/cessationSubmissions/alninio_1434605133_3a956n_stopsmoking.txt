How do I prevent my dad from smoking in my room and gaming area?

So my ps4, wiiU are in the living room, we ocasionally play on ps4 with my sisters but it's been years now and my dad won't stop smoking in the living room even after I've told him respectfully not to smoke in this area. Just a little background of me - I'm 18, from Kuwait, male, and I hate breathing in his smoke almost every day. Even when he's driving and I'm sat in the passenger seat, he smokes and I always have to roll up my shirt to my nose and mouth and basically suffocate myself to not breathe in his smoke.

He even enters my room and smokes, basically he doesn't give two shits what we ask. I took it upon myself to wrap my nose/mouth with a scarf to prevent breathing in his smoke. The reason he smokes in the living room is because that's where his computer is. I don't care if he smokes or not, I care if I breathe in his smoke, but he doesn't care about his surroundings. by the end of the day, his ashtray is FILLED with ciggaretes, sometimes he even needs two ashtrays. 

I asked him nicley and many times to smoke somewhere else, his room, outside, just not where I spend my time in the house -my room and living room. I wrote in paper the symbol for no smoking and "don't enter without knocking" he always ignores it and I'm getting so tired of it. Atleast he does knock, but sometimes he barges in without me allowing him in because he always needs to use my towels/phone charger/ hair comb.. which I also really hate.  he is kind sometimes but this cigar issue is just too much. Not only this is a problem, I can never have privacy in my room, family members always barge in without knocking despite the note "knock before entering" except for my small sister and elder brother. 

Any ideas?

EDIT: I will also add on that when there is no ashtrays around, he uses cups/glasses to put off his cigar.. where we drink water from.

Quit smoking, now suffering smokers cough?

A little background, I've been smoking for about 3 years at about 10-15 cigarettes a day. I've made attempts to quit in the past, though never for much longer than a couple of days. I've currently gone well over a month now, but I have slipped up on occasions so therefore consider myself smoke-free for over a week now. I put this down to have an absolutely amazing girlfriend who finally gave me a solid reason to man the fuck up and quit.



But on the topic, has anyone had pretty brutal smokers cough develop after they've stopped smoking? I've had coughs before when I was smoking heavier than usual, but never to this extent. I wake up after just a few hours sleeping violently coughing making it impossible to get back to sleep and the same again when I try to lay down to go to sleep. Laying down seems to trigger it, but it's getting seriously unbearable and interrupting my daily life.



I know it's to do with the cilia repairing itself from years of smoking, but is there anything I can do that will subdue the effects? It's been going on for a good few days now and shows no signs of letting up. There's no blood or heavy phlegm, so I'm not sure about whether to see a doctor or not. I know this isn't a medical thread, but I imagine other people must have been through this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

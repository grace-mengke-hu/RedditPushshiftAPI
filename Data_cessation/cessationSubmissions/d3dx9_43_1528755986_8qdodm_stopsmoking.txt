Any tips for dealing with cravings associated with smoking during/after unavoidable activities?

The one for me is after a meal. It's literally the only smoke that I ever looked forward to. Basically to a point when I think about a meal, I also automatically think about the smoke I'd have afterwards. I've been trying to quit for a few months at least, and I've been failing - and maybe it's just coincidence - but the pattern seems to be that I'm having a major problem getting over that particular craving, and it does not help that it comes multiple times a day.

Suggestions, please?

impossibru

Thank you all for support. Tomorrow I celebrate 100 days of freedom. Those bastard little soldiers of death don't even cross my mind anymore. I feel much better in every way. Also, to everyone struggling... I wish to say that pain & struggles are surmountable and temporary.

THIS TOO SHALL PASS.

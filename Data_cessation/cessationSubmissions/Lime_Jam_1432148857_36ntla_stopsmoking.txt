Finally managed to kick the habit.

I started smoking a couple of years ago due to stress, since then I had smoked 6 a day. Recently it has made me feel ill, and I realised that nicotine is a pretty crummy drug. I have a few puffs on a Vale now and then, but the frequency of that is decreasing too. I have made it a week without a cigarette and have been doing more exercise and feeling fitter. And I've saved enough money to post this from the tablet I just bought.

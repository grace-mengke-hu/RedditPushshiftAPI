I am feeling terrible and that's GOOD

Because I have been smoking for the past weeks and this week I had a big cold. It has forced me to realize that I should quit, because every time I smoked it would only become worse. I felt like an old person, every movement hurt, my muscles were weak, breathing was painful and I had to cough a lot. Now that I quit 2 days ago I am feeling better and better. Still feeling relatively bad. I am training for triathlon and I can run 19 kilometer per hour for more than a kilometer (expecting to become even faster), and now I could not even do 15 km/h (still a big improvement over a few days ago, when I could not run for a kilometer without having to stop due to the coughing). I want to win a triathlon this year and so it's especially stupid that I was smoking again.

So, it's OVER!

I have announced this to my brother as well, who has quit as well (about a month ago). The idea that we are in this together is encouraging, I hope we both beat this.

Anyways, back to feeling terrible... I made sure that I did on purpose this morning; I went to the gym and I pushed myself to my limits on the bike and treadmill, so that I had to cough a lot and FEEL how much smoking limited my ability to perform and feel good. My body got the message, it was awful (but at the same time I was happy that I was able to train again).

Smoking can make you ill eventually, but you pay a big price for it already every day that you smoke. The short term negative effects of smoking are bad enough to make a sane person quit, IMHO. So, let's get sane.

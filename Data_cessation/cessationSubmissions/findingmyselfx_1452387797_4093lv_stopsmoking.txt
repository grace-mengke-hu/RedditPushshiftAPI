Two months today!

This was my first attempt at quitting, I had been smoking for 8 years and decided I wanted to stop. It had been on my mind for a while. I had a chest infection and decided that was it, no more. The chest infection helped with not thinking about smoking while the nicotine left my body and then left me with a mental battle.

I think that wanting to quit helped, knowing that cigarettes were disgusting and looking at myself in disgust when I gave into the addiction. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. 60 days later I can breathe and I smell nice. I am working to lose weight and gain my life back. No one controls me - I am free!! It is the greatest feeling in the world. 

I have this sub to thank for the daily posts, sharing your struggles and successes for me to relate to. Keep on going! It's worth it and gets a lot easier :)

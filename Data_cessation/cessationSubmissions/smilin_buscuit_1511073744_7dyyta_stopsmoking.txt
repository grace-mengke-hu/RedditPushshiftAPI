It's been....a while.

It's been about 7 weeks since I quit.  Don't remember the last smoke but I bought my last pack on Sept. 30. It took me a few days to finish. But I can climb stairs without getting winded and I don't vomit regularly anymore (ulcers that wouldn't heal cause smoking).  Smoking is the worst. But fuck if I don't miss the social aspect of it.

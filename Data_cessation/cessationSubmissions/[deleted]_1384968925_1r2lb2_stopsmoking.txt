Nothing better to do so i smoke.

Hello I am 18 and I have been smoking since i was 16. The strange thing is that I smoke only when I go outide with my friend every weekend, so it's like 5 or 6 cigarettes weekly. Besides that I don't smoke at all. We usually cycle and when we have a break we just smoke because we have nothing better to do while we rest and talk. Can you give me some tips what can we do instead of smoking? Sorry for my english.

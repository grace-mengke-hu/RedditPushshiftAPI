Been a week!

Quit for New Years. The anxiety on Day 3 was horrible, and that made me almost crack. It was much tougher to resist than the cravings (which I'm still getting but to a lesser degree). For some reason eating mac and cheese helps out with that. 

Not really sure why I'm posting, just felt like letting people know since most my friends don't even know I smoke in the first place. Any insight, advice, or general comments appreciated

Good luck everyone!

Trying to quit again this week, second try, different approach.

The first time i quit smoking, it was a train wreck. I was working a high stress sales job, dealing with my girlfriends slave driver bosses/work (she worked 6 days a week at 55 hour minimum work week) wile my mom was also quitting smoking. At that point I had been smoking for 4 or 5 years, and was down to a pack and a half a day, compared to my all time regular high as 2.5 packs a day.
that was 8 months ago. I freaked out, had rage issues, even got into a fist fight with my car hood, and won. my boss threatened to fire me everyday from the day I started quitting because my numbers had dropped significantly.
TL:DR last time i tried, I failed and became a ragaholic for the 9 days I quit, almost lost my job, and freaked out.

I'm trying again this week, and I'm doing it under different context. I no longer work, my girlfriend got a normal job, and my mother is not quitting, I smoke a little less than I did last time I tried, about a pack/pack and a half a day. A friend of the family has offered me a spare room in their basement for a couple weeks to help with the DT process, since my mom and I fought so much last time, and she isn't quitting with me this time. I get a bedroom/bathroom in their basement, with a tv in the room. I'm also close to publishing, my first novella, and fear that quitting will destroy my motivation/writing process.
Reddit, here's where you come in. Does this plan sound like it will work better?
Any Ideas on how to help me deal with problems you forsee?
Move out date, is two days from today. Anything, I might need to bring besides the usual clothes, laptop/gaming, toiletries?

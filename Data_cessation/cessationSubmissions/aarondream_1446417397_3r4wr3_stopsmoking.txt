Thanks reddit!

When I downloaded reddit, I stumbled across the stop smoking sub forum. After reading some people's post about how they were going to quit, I decided I should start my journey as well. October 1st was the day I decided my life needed a change. I was tired a feeling like I didn't have control of my life.

The first two weeks were horrible. Every time I felt some sort of stress I had the urge to want to smoke. It was hard not to ask someone for a cigarette. I constantly had to remind myself that the end result would be worth it. I had to keep telling myself would I rather suffered a few weeks of withdrawal symptoms or would I rather suffer months or even years of lung cancer. I also had to change how I looked at other smokers. When I would try to quit in the past I would always see someone smoking and my mind would always tell me just to buy some and quit later. I didn't have any willpower. 

After two weeks, the urges weren't as bad. It's now been 31 days and I'm extremely proud of myself. this is the longest I've ever gone without smoking a cigarette.  I know it's tough but if you want it bad enough you could quit too.  I'm making a vow to myself to never pick up a cancer stick again.

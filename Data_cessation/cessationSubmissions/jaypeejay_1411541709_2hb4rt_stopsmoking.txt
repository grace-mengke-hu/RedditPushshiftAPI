It almost seems like another lifetime now -- to think about myself as a smoker. I knew long before I quit that to be successful I would have to fundamentally change the way I associate myself with tobacco, and with 
smoking. Luckily, The Easy Way had already been written and a quick read through of that really fleshed out what I had already known and thought. In fact, I never even finished the book. Never-the-less it helped me more than I care to 
write. Anyways, I just wanted to get a thread going for anyone just starting on the nicotine-free path, for them to ask any questions, or for any intermediates like me who have taken our lungs back, to discuss the ever going process.

Cheers everyone

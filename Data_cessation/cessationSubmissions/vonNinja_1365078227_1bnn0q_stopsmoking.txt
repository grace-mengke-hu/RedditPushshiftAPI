How do I write academically without nicotine?

I've been a student since before I was a smoker. Now I'm at about 2 months (I managed to stop counting days!) and the cravings are worse than ever... but only when I'm trying to work on homework. Writing academic papers is fucking impossible! I always used to buy a pack and go to the local hookah bar/coffee place and post up. Chain smoke and power out all my papers. Now? I can't even start because all I can do is think about how much I want a cigarette. Any advice?

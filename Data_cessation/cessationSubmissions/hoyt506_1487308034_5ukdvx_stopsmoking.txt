Quitting Sunday

Hey all, I'm new to this sub reddit and am determined to quit smoking starting this Sunday. I have been planning for weeks and I'm sure I will need a support system and advice to do this. I am doing this 100 percent for myself, I'm sick and tired of feeling like shit and the dent it's putting on my health and bank account. Just wanted to say hi and I will report back on Sunday once my journey has begun!

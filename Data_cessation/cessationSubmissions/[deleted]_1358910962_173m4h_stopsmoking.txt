any helpful hints?

I've been smoking for 6 years, its time that i quit that nasty habit. I'm tired of the endless throat clearing and the diminished lung capacity. i could just used some helpful tips that deal with the cravings and the urges. on a side note i smoke more when i drink , but i'm sure a lot of people are the same.

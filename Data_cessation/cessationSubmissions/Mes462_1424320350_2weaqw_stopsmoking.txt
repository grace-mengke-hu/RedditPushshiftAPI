Today has been the hardest

I quit on Sunday. I'm very happy with my choice, but today has been the hardest so far. The day was extremely overwhelming. The cravings have been ongoing since I woke up this morning. I keep planning my next cigarette and quickly come to the realization that I won't have one. I don't know why, but it's the worst feeling realizing I won't have one. Anyway, it's the end of the day and I emotionally feel like Rocky Balboa: beaten up, but I somehow still have it in me to keep going. I had a breakdown a while ago, I don't think it will be the last, but with every tear, every crushing moment, I will keep my foot on ground. Thank you for reading and understanding my feelings. This subreddit (you!) have been the most helpful thing I've found so far.

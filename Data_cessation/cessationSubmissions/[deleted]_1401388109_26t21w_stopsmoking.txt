I stopped smoking for 2 full days, then caved...

Went to my therapist's today, I explained to her that I recently went cold turkey and, knowing my history, she freaked out.  She said that with all that I've been going through, maybe it's not the best time to quit smoking, to pick a later date.  During these 2 days, I contemplated going to the hospital because I was losing my mind and thought I was dying.  I'm currently being treated for PTSD, an attempted suicide, and a whole other range of anxiety symptoms w/agoraphobia and hypochondria.  I'm currently tapering off of an anxiety medication, which has been throwing my mind out of whack in itself.  She told me I should try to quit after I'm off of my med and my mental state is stabilized.  To quit "one drug at a time."  I don't know what to do, I want to quit badly and I feel like a failure, but I felt like I was harming myself even worse in the process. :(  Maybe she's right, but I just feel like it's a lame excuse on my part.

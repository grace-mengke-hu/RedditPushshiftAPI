need advice!

right now i'm officially at 23 days &amp; 3 hours smoke free (my last cig ever was at 8:50 pm on my quit date). i was doing the patch and started with 21mg, i stepped down to 14mg yesterday and today i forgot to put it on. i realized it around 3 and decided to try to stick it out for the day. i did it but i definitely had more cravings today than i've had probably in at least a week or more. should i go back to step 2 (14mg) or maybe even step 3 (7 mg) tomorrow and continue the step down process so i don't slip up? i really really doubt ill actually ever pick up a cig again because i just don't even want to but i also don't want to sabotage myself and the progress I've made. any insight?

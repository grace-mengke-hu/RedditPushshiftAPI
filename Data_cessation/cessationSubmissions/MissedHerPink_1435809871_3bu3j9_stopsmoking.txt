The problem I have with the “Not Smoking Today” phrase


It implies that you have to use mental trickery to quit. 

It implies that people are stupid enough that they won’t realize that it’ll always be today, and you’re basically doing mental gymnastics around the reality that it means “I’m never gonna smoke”. It implies that you’re afraid to actually acknowledge that.

I’m not forcing anyone to quit in the same way as me, but I’m giving my opinion on what I think is a better and easier way to quit, for those who it might help. If that phrase really helps you, by all means, use it. But consider this:

Fucking say “I’m never gonna smoke another cigarette”. We don’t want to be smokers, and that’s what we all need to realize. 

You’re not gonna smoke today. You’re not gonna smoke tomorrow. You’re not gonna smoke ever. That’s not a scary thought. Unless this is:

You’re not gonna have terrible cravings. You’re not gonna have bad headaches. You’re not gonna plan out your entire day around cigarettes. You’re not gonna stress when you’re running out. You’re not gonna smell like shit. You're not gonna have a sore throat. You’re not gonna destroy your body. You’re not gonna die prematurely. 

You’re gonna have a lot more energy. You’re gonna be in control of your life. You’re gonna actually have a sense of smell. You’re gonna have more libido. You’re gonna actually taste your food. You’re gonna have more money. And you’re gonna feel a fuckload of a lot better. 

Why would you ever wanna limit yourself to today? Tell cigarettes to fuck off forever, and welcome your life back today.

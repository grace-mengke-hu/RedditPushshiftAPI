I decided that today I will smoke the last cigarette of my life. Any advice?

Hi, I am eighteen years old and I am a stupid kid. I have been smoking for the past three years of my life and only recently did I understand how silly the entire thing is. So, I have decided to quit. And quit today.

Problems? Oh yes. All my friends smoke and they don't understand how addicted they are. We all shrug it off but we're actively killing ourselves slowly. Being with them over the next few weeks is going to be terrible. I think I just might have to shut myself at home and study.

Secondly, my dad's going to be home for the next week and he's a heavy smoker. I probably chose the wrong time to quit smoking but I think I need this as a test. If I don't quit now, I'll find another excuse later.

But regardless, I come here for advice. I know I am doing a right thing but I need help, so any tips or anything as to what I should do would be very good for me.

almost 3 weeks

Coming up on 3 weeks, the longest time smoke free in .... hmm, decades. Never thought I could do it. It is getting easier and easier with every passing day, even around a spouse who is still smoking. Instead of feeling jealous or resentful, as I have in past attempts I feel patient and compassionate, trying to set a positive example, and simply pray that he'll see that it can be done.  I know I smell and taste better, and I swear I look younger, although that might be wishful thinking. I didn't get as tuckered out shoveling today, either.
I called the tobacco helpline this morning and asked for step 3. I plan to switch to that a week early, which will be on Saturday. I am anxious to get past the patch phase. 
I really appreciate SD and the support here. Thank you!

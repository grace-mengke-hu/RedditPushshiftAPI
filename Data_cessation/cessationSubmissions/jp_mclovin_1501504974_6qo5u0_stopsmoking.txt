Hooray for 3 weeks

Had a few serious cravings this weekend, but I made it. 

On an unrelated topic,  am I the only one to not finish Allen Carr's book? I mean,  I liked the message and all,  but I couldn't even get half way through it.  I'm truly happy for those that it helped,  but I could not bring myself to finish it.  (Be gentle)

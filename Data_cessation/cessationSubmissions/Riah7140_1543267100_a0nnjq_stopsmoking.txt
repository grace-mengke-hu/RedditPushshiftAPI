I've been cutting back.

Been smoking for around 11 years. More reliant on it than I wish I was, working as a pastry chef in a demanding upscale hotel for sad wages, started smoking way too much. Anyway, I switched jobs recently to something much less chaotic and I'm newly engaged. I desperately want to quit before my wedding next year. It's a stupid crutch. Ive moved to a decent vaporizer that has been the best  help thus far.  The thing that is getting me the most right now is the random bouts of irritability, some intense hunger and the cough. My God the cough. When does the phlegm end?! Just always on the lookout for out for tips to ease the irritation!

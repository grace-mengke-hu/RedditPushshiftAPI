Just Passed 1 Week

I had my 30th birthday and told myself I wasn’t going to be a smoker, that smoking is for 20something year olds. Getting married in a few months and promised my future wife I wouldn’t be a smoker when we got married. Feeling pretty good so far, some cravings but nothing too extreme. Also just finished week 1 of C25K to help combat the possible weight gain.

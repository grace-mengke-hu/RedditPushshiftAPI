1week pre-cessation

I have finally put out my last cigarette after a week's use of the nicotine patch. Tomorrow (today) will be my first smoke-free day and I'm very excited. I found the smell of my last cigarette nauseating before and after. Last time I said my only motivation was the money I'd be saving, but now I can say I am looking forward to a clean mouth, better taste, better productivity, and ridding that smoker's cough once and for all. I love this subreddit and best of luck to all. Goodnight.

21 days to kick a bad habit.

Long time Reddit lurker, first time ever posting, haha. I just wanted to stop in and thank the whole r/stopsmoking community. Every post I've read here has helped me stay cigarette-free for three weeks! Everyday is easier than the last, as long as you understand that, you can do it too!

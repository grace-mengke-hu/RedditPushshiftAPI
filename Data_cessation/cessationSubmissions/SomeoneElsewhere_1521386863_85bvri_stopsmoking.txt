Day 7 on patches. Doing really well, and LOVE breathing but, holy crap, I am crazy hungry!

It's just nuts. I feel like I could eat everything in sight. I'm trying to lower fat intake too (TIL turkey bacon is a pointless atrocity), so . . . my appetite has become a wild ride. :)

It's a fair trade. I really love air, and this year's spring air feels like heaven. 

Keep quitting, folks!

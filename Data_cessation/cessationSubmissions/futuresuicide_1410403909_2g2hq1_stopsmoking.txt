How much difference a few months can make.

This time last year, my company wanted to send me to a seminar on the other side of the country.  I wen't along with it to better my position with them, but feared a 9 hour plane flight with no cigs. I have never flown before.  Well that fell through, and I've quit smoking since.  Now theyre talking about sending me again and my concerns this time are how  I'll be able to sleep or get my luggage right.  Not a worry in the world about not smoking for a few hours.
Those in the early stages, just keep hanging in there!

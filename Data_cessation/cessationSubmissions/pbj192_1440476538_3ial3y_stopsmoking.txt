I really want a cigarette right now.

Been "quitting" for over a year now, screwed up a few times whilst drunk, but, haven't been a regular smoker for that long, so, a year or a month depending on whether you want to count from the last cigarette or the last time I was smoking on a daily basis. Things are kinda crap right now and I'm just sitting here thinking why the hell did I even bother, why not drive down to the gas station and buy a pack, fuck it, who's going to care either way. Is the shortness of breath really that bad of price to pay for not being miserable all the time, not stuffing my face to try to scratch the itch. I quit because I didn't like the idea of something having control over me, but all it takes is a gif of someone smoking a cigarette and I'm having a full blown craving and I'm miserable for the rest of the night. 

Fuck this shit.

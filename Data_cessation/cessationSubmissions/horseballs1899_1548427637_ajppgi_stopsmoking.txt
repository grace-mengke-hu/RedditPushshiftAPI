I'm weak when drunk...

... so I keep a short list on my phone home screen to read when I feel a moment of weakness (its working so far!). Of course, these are personal reasons to me, but do feel free to try your own! :-

  

Please. Listen to this. You were nearly in tears at the thought of being a smoker forever. Things to remember:

1. Imagine cycling/ running warm summer days at the beach running with the kids - you want to smoke your way through life? Get healthy and ENJOY being healthy.

2. Having one Cig will lead to the other - you going to wake up one day and suddenly decide to stop? Don't kid yourself. Now is the moment to be strong.

3. Don't look at this as an isolated situation. You will be smoking forever if you have this one now it will cost you.

4. Don't envy the smokers outside. Pity them, they're not enjoying it. They're doing it because they can't enjoy themselves without it.

5. Look at the non-smokers. Get back to that state. Enjoy your night, like them, without stinking of smoke.

6. Tomorrow morning you will be disappointed in yourself if you do smoke, you will be back to 'day 1' again.

7. Imagine the day when you can say to \[wife's name\] and yourself "wow, I haven't smoked in 5 years". You'll be 35 a fit and healthy dad.

8. Take a deep breath of CLEAN air and go and get a drink. Forget about smoking and enjoy being FREE!

Expect your brain to be a bitch

Hey y'all. Be prepared for a lot of mood swings. You are litterally rewiring your brain and changing patterns. That's a thing our brains find hard. You will have days where it all seems black and fucked up. Please do not give up when these days come. 

That's all. Much love to all the quitters.

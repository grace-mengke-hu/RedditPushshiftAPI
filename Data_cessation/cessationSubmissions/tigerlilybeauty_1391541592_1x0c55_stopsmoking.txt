Need some advice..

I quit smoking due to me being pregnant. But for some reason i want to force myself start back up after i give birth?!

I was trying to figure out why i felt that way and i thought.. Maybe its because i consider it a hobby? I know this sounds ridiculous and immature but ive been smoking so long that it just feels like the right thing to do.

I need some advice to help me get my head straight.. Or someone to talk to, please and thank you

Day One. Again.

Here I go again.  How many "Day One" events have there been?  Hundreds?  Probably.  About eight years ago I quit for some time, probably a month, I can't really remember.  It seems like a distant memory to me though.  Since then, the longest I've managed to go without cigarettes is two days.  It's not really a lot is it?  But it is, to me, when I want a cigarette.  I think all I want at the moment is to hit that magic three day marker, where the nicotine has then supposedly all gone.  It's pathetic that I can't even manage that to be honest.


I thought that the morning smoke would be the hardest, but that one doesn't seem to have bothered me too much.  I can happily skip it, drive to work and sit in the office all day.  But when that clock starts getting closer to 5pm (as it is now), I start thinking how easy it would be to stop at the shop on my home.  It's like beating metal on an anvil.  I can feel my willpower gradually being pummelled into nothingness.  The worst thing is, I know it's coming, and I seem to be powerless to do anything about it.  I can spend the whole day thinking I'm doing so well, feeling great about it, telling myself I won't break.  It only takes a split second decision, my mindâ€™s refusal to protest, a detour to the shop, and I've failed again.


I'm telling myself that today, this week, this month will be different.  I heard this place was quite good for support and motivation?  I must confess, I'm not really a 'redditor' (if that's what the term is), so this is all a bit new to me as well.  I'm in the UK, it's coming up to 2.30pm, which means the day's end (and that shop) is looming like a hammer over a nail.  I do feel a little bit more determined today, but it doesn't take long at all to snap.

Wish me luck.  I wish you all and more if you're trying this with me, or those of you that are much farther down the road.

sitting in the airport

I have been a smoker for longer then I care to say and have wanted to quit for as long as I can remember being a smoker. I am going on a trip for a week , totally different climate then I am used to and will be away from almost everyone that I know. I bought a pack yesterday with the plan that I would finish it before I got to the airport. I had two left in the pack when I got to the airport. I walked outside and just threw them away and went back inside. I have always had that one last one that never was the last. I think this time its for real.

TL;DR anyone have experience with planning out the last one compared to just walking away?

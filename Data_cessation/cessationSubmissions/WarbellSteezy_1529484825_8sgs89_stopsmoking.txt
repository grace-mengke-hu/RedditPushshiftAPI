Tips for stopping the urge to smoke when drinking?

I used to smoke sober but then quit smoking while sober about 4 years ago. However, I have intense cravings to smoke whenever I go out and drink. 


I cut down my drinking very heavily after college in order to be more healthy, because I'm pretty physically active, and also I generally try to make more productive use of my time. But when I go out and have drinks about once a month, I end up smoking 3-5 cigarettes a night. 


**So, any tips to get rid of the mental attachment I have between drinking and smoking cigarettes? Thank you all for any help/advice!**

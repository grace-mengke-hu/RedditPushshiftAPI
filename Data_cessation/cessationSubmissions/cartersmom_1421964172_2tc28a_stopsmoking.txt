3 weeks 1 day and all I can think is 6 more days for a month under my belt... Bring it on ciggies im beating you!!!

guys thanks for all your amazing support, im so overwhelmed ive made it this far it sounds silly but 15 years at 40 a day and finally waking up and saying... I refuse to smoke when I'm 30 im quitting today (New Years eve) and ive stuck to it im so happy, I actually feel sorry for my smoker friends now especially the 1 who had a tooth extracted today and was told 48 hours minimum no smoking and she made it around 5 hours I feel bad she's that addicted she's willing to risk an infection and more pain
Well that's her choice I won't preach I just wanted to stop by and say let's not smoke today guys lets stay strong and United and let's kick the cigarettes ass together!! Let's beat our addictions 1 day at a time

How to Trick your brain

Yo fellas.So this is the big thing.I been smoking since I was maybe 16.So it has been long 9 years.
My big idea is:
I definitely will struggle with the first weeks.
That being said I used to smoke weed on monthly basis.
So this is my great Idea.
What if I just for now Smoke a little bit of kush in the evening to fight with the lack of nicotine in my body.Also for muscle relaxing purposes.
And then at some point I might not have to smoke at all since by then I should have a clean body.*Nicotine Free*
Let me know if this might work or if I'm just full of shit and trying to find the easiest way :D 
Appreciate the Feedback.

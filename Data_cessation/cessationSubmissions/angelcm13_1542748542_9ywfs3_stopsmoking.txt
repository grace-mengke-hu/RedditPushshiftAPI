Shmoke and a pancake

5 days cigarette free. Iâ€™m irritable and anxious. Sleeping has been a struggle, a lot of ups and downs and night sweats. The sweating is the worst..... I was a heavy smoker but I was in such denial that I would have any withdrawals. I was very wrong. Why is this all I can think about!? 
Tips, tricks, vices, any advice welcome! Thanks!

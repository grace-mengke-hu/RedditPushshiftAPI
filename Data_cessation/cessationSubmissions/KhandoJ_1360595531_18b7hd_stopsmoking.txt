Prescription Pills help?

Each time I attempt to quit smoking, I make it several hours to a day.  However, my worst enemy seems to be my brain.  It is not the craving that bothers me so much, but my brain seems to be super active.  I think  of all the ways to stop it, but thoughts of going to get more smokes or why I want one seem to fill my brain up.

I have read Carr's book numerous times, tried Chantix and lots of other methods, but my brain seems to win.

Has anyone tried drugs like Xanax, Lexapro or the such to help?  I keep reading of the negative side effects of these drugs and it bothers me more.

I am 99% ready to quit, but my brain is way to active to push me to the 100%.

I need help defeating my brain and prescription pills may be my best choice, but wanted to know if anyone has had success.
Thanks

Strongest Craving I've Had In Months

So I just somehow got this nostalgiac flash-back of smoking cigarettes, which led me to mindlessly take a peak at /r/Cigarettes. After a few moments, I asked myself what I was doing and clicked off the tab. I don't know whether it was stress or something that caused that craving, but man it was strong. On the upside though it's gone now! I'd never put myself through the torture of smoking again no matter how much my mind plays tricks on me.

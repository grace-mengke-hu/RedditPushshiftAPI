Carr reminders: Be stubbornly positive. No moping.

I have been reading Carr's book and he clearly emphasizes we will succeed in this quit only if we look at it as a _gain_ in health, wealth, self-confidence, courage, tranquility, etc.

We need to remember we are winners over the addiction. If we have a craving, he advises looking at it as a reminder of our success. Instead of moping, he says we should rejoice-Yay! I don't need that silly ol', icky habit.

Be stubborn. Be positive. Be stubbornly positive.

While I read, I take notes and I thought the following snippets might be good, shareable reminders for us all (?).

Here goes:

There is nothing to give up, only things to gain.

Things gained:
Health
Energy
Money
Confidence
Peace of mind
Courage
Tranquility
Freedom
Self-respect

There is no such thing as just one cigarette. One cigarette means a lifetime of destroying yourself mentally and physically.

Never doubt. Know. Be certain.

You can achieve this.
There is nothing to give up.
There is no such thing as one cig.
Smoking is drug addiction. 
Separate the disease from the frame of mind. Be a non-smoker.
Rejoice in the fact. Enjoy life.

Be certain you will abstain completely.

Frame of mind: 
Isn't this marvelous I am a non-smoker!

NO MOPING!

Rejoice! Look at me! Ridding myself of the evil monster.

Nonsmokers are better equipped to deal with life stresses. Cigarettes make stress worse. Bad days are bound to happen. Nonsmokers do not need cigarettes to feal with bad days.

On bad days:
Today is not so good, but smoking won't make it better. Tomorrow is another day. At least I know I have kicked that awful addiction.


Once you stop, you tend to blame everything wrong on the fact you stopped. The cigarette never solved the problem and often created stress that contributed to the problem.

You are going to be miserable if you smoke.

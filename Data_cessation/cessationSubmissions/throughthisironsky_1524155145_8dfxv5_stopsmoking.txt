Although your nicotine-brainwashed mind would like to believe otherwise, it's TWICE as good as you think to quit!

I reflected today on how I'd feel if I hadn't stopped 34 days ago. It's not just a question of subtracting all the health regeneration that has occurred (and wow it's night and day), it's also a question of imagining how much worse I'd have felt going through another 34 days of self-hating, of smoke-stained fingers and smoke-stained teeth, of bad smells and wheezy breathing. It would be TWICE as bad as I imagine. Therefore if you quit it's going to be TWICE as good as you think! SO QUIT IS SO GOOD

Random 72 day check in!

It's been 72 days since I quit smoking, guys, and I haven't felt better in my life. This time last year, I was smoking a pack a day. Sometimes more. Even though I look back at last year fondly, I don't want to light up anymore. It was fun, but that phase of my life has passed. My health is worth more than the cigarettes.

I haven't bought a pack since I quit. I've had two cigarettes since I quit and I couldn't even get halfway through them before I started feeling sick. I even hate the smell of smoking now. I'm very happy to say that my body has lost its tolerance. I'm even getting my running back! I've been able to run 3-5 miles a day these past few weeks and I don't plan on stopping.

I smoked from the minute I turned 18 to shortly after I turned 21. I know that's nothing compared to a lot of smokers who have put decades into it, but I still had a hard time quitting regardless. I just want to reassure everybody that it can be done. Here's to being a non-smoker.

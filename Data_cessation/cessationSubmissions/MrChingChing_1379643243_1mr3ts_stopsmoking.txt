I have never made a post here before

Because I didn't see a need to. I think this is a great subreddit and subscribed so I can see others 'true' reasons to not smoke (In my honest opinion, health effects are of concern, but a lot comes down to mentality, and this subreddit helps give me proper perspective of whether smoking is worthwhile or not).


Now with that in mind, this post isn't concerning me, it's concerning a friend of mine. She is around my age, about 16 years, she just sent me a pic of her smoking a cigarette. Thing is, she has been born with a ton of mental disorders, schrizophrenia, bipolar, you name it, and she has it. She told me recently in a message that she was going to have a max life expectancy of 30 years, but by then she will have forgotten to breathe, walk, or speak (But this isn't because of smoking, her mental state is the worst it has been she said and she is in a hospital). She has lost hope in everything, so I can see why in her somewhat last moments she is now resorting to smoking as the only sense of comfort she' had, I met her online, she doesn't even live where I live, her family hates her, not many friends, and now she is smoking which I don't know will help her problems.


Those of you who have had the toughest shit and had to use smoking as a crutch and stop it, can you explain to me your reasons? And I'm..I'm sorry if this isn't the right post to talk about this kind of thing, but I'm not sure where else to go, maybe someone can please message me quickly if this isn't the right place to post, I will gladly remove it's just..so yeah.


Edit: And of course I'm not going to force her to stop smoking..I have trouble seeing why in her perspective she should anyway, maybe that's a reason to post here, can someone help clarify if there is any purpose for her to smoke, or maybe advice, or anything?

While taking a puff I had a familiar pain in my throat, the words "throat cancer" came to mind and I just thought

"F*ck it. I can't stand one more day of this."
And that's how I quit smoking yesterday. After months of agony and true open sober self-hate for being addicted to this awful awful weed. I've had enough! I can't live like this anymore. Waking up tired, going to bed grumpy, taking naps like a drug addict, stinking up the place, bumming smokes when I'm out of my own, panicking when i can't find a lighter, like literally panicking, being thankful for long flights so I can have a few hours of peace!, not knowing when I'm truly actually hungry, being used to ignoring thirst, constantly craving something that is just painful for me! All this for what? Literally...for what? SO I can give myself the pleasure of taking off tight shoes? Why put them on in the first place? I'm done, folks. Saw a man smoking today and I honestly didn't gaf. I didn't envy him, I didn't pity him. He just melted into the background like anything else. I'm actually done!

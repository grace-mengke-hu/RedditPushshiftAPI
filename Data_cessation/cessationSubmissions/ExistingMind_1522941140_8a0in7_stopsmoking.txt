Need help

Some context, I'm 25 years old. I graduate in May. I'm trying to quit and have been for the past two days. I buy a pack, smoke a few and then rip up the cigarettes and say no more and then I cave and buy another. For me the hardest part is because I'm obsessing over what I can't have and focus on it. I smoke when I drive, I smoke at work to get outside instead of being indoors. The worst is I know I can do it but I just cave. I have Allen Carrs book and started reading it but didn't finish it, more like skimmed. I know it doesn't replace or fill in gaps. 

Preferrably I'd like to quit cold turkey and I know how but I just havent been successful. I've been able to control my eating habits and lost 60lbs in the past three months so I know I have the willpower but I'm just frustrated with myself for saying not saying no to ciggs. Any help and tips would be helpful. I just feel like it's hard because I obsess over what I can't have and I keep focused on it and its just become a bad habit that's stuck for 5 years. 

Sorry that its all over the place. Thanks in advance guys!

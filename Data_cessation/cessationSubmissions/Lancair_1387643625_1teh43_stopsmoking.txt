Smoked last night

So, I fell last night and smoked. Not even sure why. I've been dealing with a lot of stress during my home visit, but that's pretty much past. I think I did it "just because." I had one cigarette. In a way, it was the best thing I could do. It tasted awful. A little while after (within an hour or so), I started wondering why I even did it. It tasted awful. Made me a little dizzy and, just overall, I didn't like it. It made me remember why I quit in the first place and actually strengthened my resolve not to smoke again.

So, I slipped, fell, but realized why I had gotten on the wagon in the first place. I don't really regret it, because one cigarette helped to make sure I don't buy a pack. Seriously. After smoking it, I wondered what I ever saw in smoking. It doesn't exactly taste that good. So...is it cool if I leave my badge where it is?

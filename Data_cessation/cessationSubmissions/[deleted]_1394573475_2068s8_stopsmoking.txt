1 day!

Hey!

Today was my first day without cigarettes! It was pretty tough at times but now that i'm going to bed I realize that it was worth it. It's gonna be hard not to smoke again tomorrow, but I hope I will manage.

I got one problem though..
I think i'm gonna need a new form of instant gratification that cigarettes are so good for. Anybody got any suggestions?

I hope to keep you guys updated, if only for my own motivation!

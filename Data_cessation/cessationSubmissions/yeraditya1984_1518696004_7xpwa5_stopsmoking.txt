Day 5 and I’ve been told to visit the forum

This forum is both helpful and not - it’s helpful if you help others quit because then you feel doubly good about quitting. It’s not helpful to see so many others struggling as much as me. 

But I’ve decided to postpone the habit one day at a time and get to day 40.

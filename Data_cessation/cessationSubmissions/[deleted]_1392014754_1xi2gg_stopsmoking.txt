30 days today! How did I spend it? Laying in bed w/covers up to my neck w/my two kitties. Why?

cause we had a horrible double whammy snow/ice storm(s) and my electricity just came back on.  I made a cup of coffee, turned on computer and hellllloooo Reddit!

Was I tempted?  Nope. It was just me and my two kitties and a good book.  

Thanks to all for 30 days worth of support, encouragement and believing in/for me that I could do it.

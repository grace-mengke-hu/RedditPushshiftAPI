Intense craving attack. WTF do I do?!

Only just quit 3 hours ago. Just finished a meal and now I'm craving like fuck for a smoke, but I want to quit. I must quit. I don't want these cravings to last me for months, and I don't want to experience them again after a while.

Please help, wtf do I do to power these out? This is torture.

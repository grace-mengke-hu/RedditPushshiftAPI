Resetting my badge

I managed to make it about a month without any nicotine whatsoever. I made the same mistake I have made during previous quits and figured partaking in sharing a spliff every now and then wouldn't hurt. This made my cravings come back, and yesterday I actually smoked an entire cigarette. 

There is only one way to succeed, and that is never to take another puff. That includes spliffs. It's a very simple rule, and I have decided to respect it from now on. No more spliffs, and sure as hell no more cigarettes.

Was 4 months in, lost my job

"Fuck it, my life is shit, I don't even care about the health risks anymore. Not gonna be happy so why be healthy"

Had a pack and stopped again, now 1 month clean. I'm so pissed at myself for cracking, would have been 6 months next month which is a great mental milestone for me, but no, I'm back to 1 month. 

Still, it feels great to be a non-smoker again!

Don't Give Up

I started using the app called 'Smoke free'. It keeps me plugged in daily to being aware of my desire to quit. I tried & failed to quit countless times before. The problem was that after feeling really good for a few days of not smoking, i'd suddenly come to this place psychologically where all of sudden quitting didn't seem all that important. I'd end up buying a pack & just tell myself i'd quit the next day; I'd already proved to myself I could go a few days. But the real thing that suffered after I picked up that pack was my self-confidence. Everytime I lit up, I smoked away a part of my courage to quit- & always felt more defeated. The definition of insanity is to repeat something over & over again & expect a different result. I now see that trying to quit god only knows how many times over the past 10 years has been completely insane. No more. Mostly I'm just done with smoking away my self-confidce. Nicotine is the most addicting drug out there- but as quickly as it enters your system, it leaves it. Try reading Allen Carr's 'Easy Way to Stop Smoking'. It's $12 on Amazon, that's about the cost of 2 packs of cigarettes, it's worth it. I have a lot of friends that swear by it & I'm about 1/2 way through it. Also the app Smoke free has 'missions' to do everyday & will help keep you plugged in. 400+ days is an amazing accomplishment- having smoked a few does not mean you're a smoker again. Don't give up, you can do this.

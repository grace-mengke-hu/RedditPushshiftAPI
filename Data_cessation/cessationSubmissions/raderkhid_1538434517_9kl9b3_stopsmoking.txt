Just threw my pack away.

I had some dental work done this morning and was told not to smoke. What better time to quit? I smoke a pack a day and have been wanting to quit for a while now, but I have no willpower. I’ve “tried” to “quit” but never made it more than a couple days. Stumbled upon this sub in a google search and I’m glad I found it. Here’s to a healthier, less expensive lifestyle. 👊

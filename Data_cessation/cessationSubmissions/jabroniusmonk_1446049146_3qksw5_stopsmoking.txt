Two weeks today. Need a little advice.

Today marks my 14th day without any nicotine.  I quit cold turkey two weeks ago after a really bad experience on the patch that caused a panic attack and anxiety.  This quit has been pretty strange to say the least.  For one, I have had almost zero cravings for nicotine.  I read Alan Carr's book, so maybe that has helped me avoid unnecessary cravings.  

I have basically just been waiting for withdrawal symptoms to go away.  Anxiety, sleep disturbances, upset stomach were pretty bad for the first week and have now started to get significantly better.  I have been going to the gym to exercise almost every single day, as well as using a guided mindfulness meditation app (Headspace).

What is concerning me is that even though some symptoms are getting better, I am still having a hard time enjoying things that I used to enjoy (music, watching TV, podcasts, playing with my dogs, eating tasty foods).  I don't really feel depressed, just kind of emotionally blunted and thin skinned.  It does concern me that if this stage lasts too long, I could slip into a depression though.  One of the only things that has kept me positive and that I have enjoyed is the hope that the future will get better soon, and reading through this sub.

Fellow quitters, can you please share your experiences with me about the mental changes you went through around this stage in your quit (2-4 weeks) and any advice you may have.  To be honest, I am a little scared right now with what is going on with my mental state.

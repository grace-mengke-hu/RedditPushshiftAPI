Time to say goodbye

I haven't touched a cig in almost 18 months, and I couldn't have done it without reading all the motivating stories on this sub.  I am going through my subscribed subs and cleaning up the list a bit, and I think it's time I say goodbye to this awesome sub.  

Stay strong all you beautiful people, you can do it!

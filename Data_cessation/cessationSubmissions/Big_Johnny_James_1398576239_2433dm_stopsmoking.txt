Quitting right here. Right now.

I'm quitting right here, right now, at the age of 24, after three years of smoking cigarettes. I've quit a few days to a few months a multitude of times. I'm posting this as an extra reminder that this is it. This is my last and final quit. It's for good this time. I feel that three years isn't very long to have been smoking and that I can fully restore my health and any damage I may have done. I've struggled with anxiety and OCD for 10 years and, although I'm not overweight by any means, I have always wanted to be in better shape. Cigarettes have been holding me back from my dreams of being less anxious, less obsessive-compulsive, and more fit. Does anybody have any advice or motivation for a guy like me?

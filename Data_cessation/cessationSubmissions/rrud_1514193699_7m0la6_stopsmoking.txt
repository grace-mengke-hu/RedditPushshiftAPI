Not my first jab at it but I hope this one sticks.

I have tried quitting before, recently went 45 days without it but got hooked again when my friend going through a hard time offered me (he didn’t knew I had quit) and I accepted thinking that a single one wouldn’t harm me. My roommate has asked me to post here thinking some support would help me. My last one was 10 mins ago and now I am here. I have acknowledged that I am addicted to it again and need to stop. I would appreciate any tips that can help me.

The last time I just stopped after an accident, didn’t use any nicotine gum or patch.

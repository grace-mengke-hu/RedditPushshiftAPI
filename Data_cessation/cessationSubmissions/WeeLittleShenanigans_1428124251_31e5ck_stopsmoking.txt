I keep cycling in and out of smoking

I quit for usually 1-2 months at a time, usually with only a couple slip ups when I'm drinking, but I always come back.  It's always some stupid reason too and I'm able to realize when I got back into the habit of smoking again but somehow my brain just silences the part of my brain that would scream "quit!".  

I just got back on the bandwagon a couple weeks ago.  I was at the gym and squatted a bit too heavy and my back was hurting for a few days, then I got sick for a week and a half.  The entire two weeks I've been smoking after going out on St. Paddy's and having cigarettes with me.  Now, two weeks later, my back is fine and I'm over my cold but here I am still smoking.  It kills my motivation to go to the gym too.

I'm going out tomorrow so I know that I will end up smoking since I have been lately but I've made a promise to myself to go to the gym on Sunday and run a couple miles and lift so I can get back on track.

Sorry, just needed to rant to deal with my frustration with myself!

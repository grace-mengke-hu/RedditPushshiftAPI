I need some help/insight please.

So I'm ashamed to say I have been smoking for 2.5 years now. It all started when I met my GF she smokes like a chain and it's always around me. 
I never smoked before I started dating her, I was violently against cigarettes. And now look at me I smoke. 
I was a college athlete and always so fit and active. I think since I started smoking my fitness and health has declined noticeably. 

How can I stop when my GF whom lives with me still smokes. I want to stop but it's seeming harder and harder. 
I hate when she smokes in my house or my car. My friends all ridicule me for stinking but I know it's tough love coming from them. 

I'm lost, frustrated and need some help. 
Cold turkey? How do I confront my SO and what do I say? 


Edit: thank you all for your help we had a talk I don't know if she took me serious but I set a date, starting Monday no more smoking in the house, car, or around me. 
Wish me luck starting Monday I will be a non-smoker

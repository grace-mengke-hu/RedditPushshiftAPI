The things smoking kept me from doing...

I’m planning to take my son camping soon, and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve wanted to do this for a long time and we finally are. Tonight the thought crossed my mind: “Why am I just now doing this when I have wanted to for so long?”  And then I realized it was because of smoking. I couldn’t take my son camping because I couldn’t smoke. I never smoked in front of my kids— and it would be embarrassing to light up in a camp ground anyway. And I would have to spend a lot of time sneaking around and hiding from him, stuff like that. It was easier to just put it off. 

Day 16 and can’t believe I waited so long to quit.

Just waved goodbye to day 25. Dying a bit inside.

Received a new project yesterday (no pay for months) and almost just stressed walked into the local smoke shop and bought a pack of Camel Blues. Didn't, but came very, very close.

I've noticed that, since week three, I've become awfully angry 24/7. It's become much harder these past few days than it was after first quitting. Of course, the stress doesn't help. Is this a normal thing?

Five weeks tomorrow!

I always find my motivation to stop is at its strongest when I am doing exercise. Have been running and gym training quite a bit and really feeling the benefits of not smoking for almost five weeks now.  I feel so much fitter, sharper and healthier.  A long way to go, but feeling pretty positive atm and pretty moved and inspired by some of the stories and personal testimonies on here.

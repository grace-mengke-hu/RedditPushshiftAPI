This is it.

I've been smoking ever since I was 19 and I am 27 now. I've tried to quit many many times before but in vain. 
I threw away half a pack of cigarettes and I quit smoking today. Just went 24 hours without smoking and although the cravings exist, I've fought them off. Onwards to a healthier life. 

Edit : Thank you so much for all the love and support. Day 2 and craved for a cigarette right after breakfast but did not succumb. 

Update : it's been 31 days since I wrote this post and the only time I caved was when I went drinking with my colleagues. Ended up smoking 4 cigarettes and felt super bad about it. But those were my only cigarettes this month. Thank you reddit for helping me through this.

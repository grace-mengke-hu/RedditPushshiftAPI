Changed up my brand, now really not interested in smoking anymore

I downloaded the Smoke Free app to help me quit cigs for good, and one of the tips it gives is to change your brand of cigarette like 4 days before your quit date. So I switched from smoking Camel Filters to Marlboro Menthols, and I thought that it was so disgusting. I'm only on day 2 and I've only had a few cravings, so I imagine that more will come, but I really think that changing the brand before quitting really helped.

Almost bought a pack yesterday

I quit nearly 3 months ago and I feel good, don't care even if other people smoke in front of me. Physically I feel free from the addiction, but not quite emotionally. 
   I have been battling depression, yesterday was soo hard on me, I just wanted to cry and stay in my bed(which I did). Later I went grocery shopping, was standing in line and saw cigarettes... I never wanted to smoke so much!! It was not the first time I was emotionally triggered, but it was definitely the worst one(so far). Well.. i stormed out of the shop and didn't buy them. 

Does it get easier over time? I soo wanted to give in and get my pack of lucky strikes... I am afraid, I won't be able hold it together the next time I feel like sh%t.

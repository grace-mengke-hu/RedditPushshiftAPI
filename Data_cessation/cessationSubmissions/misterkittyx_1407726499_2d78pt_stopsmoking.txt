I had my first "wow" moment today...

I have a group of friends that smoke. I went outside to get some air and they followed...only they lit up. Not only did I not have the urge to do it too, but it smelled disgusting. It was strong and the smoke burned my nose. I had to go back in and I could smell it on my clothes afterward and felt gross. I know this may seem strange but I just can't even be around it anymore, and I'm only on day 19.

It felt good for me. I'm so glad I made this choice.

Day Five!

Now that I have reached the day where most (if not all) the nicotine is out of my system, I decided to detox completely for the next 48 hours. I've never detoxed before, so it's definitely making my body feel funny. I'm stoked I made it this far. I still get cravings, but I find myself wanting to go running more so.

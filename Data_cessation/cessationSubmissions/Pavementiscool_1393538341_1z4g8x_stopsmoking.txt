A little advice from you veterans would be helpful!

So, a little background...

 I've been a smoker for about 3 years now. For the majority of that I was half a pack a day, and sometimes that drifted towards a pack a day. There were days during those three years where I wouldn't smoke one cigarette and week/month long periods where I would cut down to 1-5 cigarettes a day. In fact the last 2 months that's where I've found myself, 1-5 cigarettes a day, with the occasional day of none.

Now, the last few weeks I haven't really been enjoying my cigarettes as much, and on top of that I'm broke and can't afford cigarettes anyway. I've been milking my last pack I have and I have like 10 cigs left and I was thinking of leaving it just like that... I guess what I need help with is, what should my next move be to finally just stop?

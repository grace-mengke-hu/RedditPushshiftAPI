i used to go hunting the streets for cigarettes

 searching through bins just to get a hit for a joint. in all honesty i realize this is a bit different from straight smoking but i do realize how addictive this addiction is.   


all i'm craving is smoke right now, we all know how bad this addiction is but do i want to go back on the streets looking for half smoked cigarettes just to have a joint? probably not.

Smoker's disgust

I'm still an active smoker. 16 years now, with many short lived and half assed attempts to quit, and just a handful that have gone past a week.

Due to fear for my reputation I no longer smoke in public, or in my car. At home I smoke in one spot on the back porch. You'd think this would mean fewer cigarettes but essentially I go through withdrawal during every work day, and make up for it by chain smoking in both the morning and evening. 

I feel sick and tired. Weak and pained. Nauseous and lethargic. I'm only 30, but have the physical stamina of an elderly person and the complexion of a middle aged bar fly. I'm thin, but far from fit. I have random tension and pain all throughout my neck, back, and abdomen.

I eat healthy foods, unless I choose to smoke my breakfast and chase it with coffee. Sometimes to the point where I gag and choke before 8am. 

I'm compassionate in theory but impatient with the people closest to me. I'm quite optimistic, unless I'm craving nicotine, in which case i treat minimally negative circumstances like they're earth shattering. 

I'm a loving and committed mother, but quickly become annoyed when I can't smoke, and spend countless hours of each weekend catching up on the cigarettes I can't smoke during the week.

 I'm fairly certain that the damage I've done will cause me a slow painful death that my children will be an audience to. In any case, this habit has already robbed them of having the best mother they could have.

I don't know if I'll ever successfully quit for good, but I'm tired of this. Hopefully sharing this disgust with myself will help someone thinking if starting again to keep their lungs clean and minds clear.

Tl;Dr a smoker shares the day to day disgust she has with herself. Read if you think you want to go back.

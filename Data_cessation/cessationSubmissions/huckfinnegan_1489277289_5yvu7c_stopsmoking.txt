The last quit

I had been smoking regularly for 5+ years, mainly rollies but I went through stages of smoking tailored cigarettes too. I must admit I enjoy the process of rolling cigarettes and the smell of scented rum tobacco.

I used to go out partying a lot, took heaps of drugs, smoked and sold weed for a few years. I was high pretty much 24/7 for 2014 and 2015. I finally hit my quota with weed, got sick of doing nothing with my life and living in a shitty share house. I quit drugs without too much hassle, it was all mindset.

It's the quitting smoking that's the really really hard one to quit. They sneak up on you too. I was fine not smoking for 6 months, then I'd go out again and have a few beers and suddenly be back on the darts. 

I've quit numerous times and been off them for months at a time but that's not good enough. There's not point quitting semi-permanently and allowing myself room to have minor relapses. I'm quitting for good this time. I've had enough. 

Mods please give me a counter. This marks day 1 of my final quit

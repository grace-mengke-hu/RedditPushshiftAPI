I've been thinking to stop, but my body craved for it. I did successfully stop for 3 weeks, but resumed. Now, I'm gonna do it for good.

Hey r/stopsmoking! 
Today will be the first day I'll go smoke-free after an unsuccessful month of incessant smoking. A friend bought a cigarette maker and was fascinated by it, which made me come back into the smoking cycle. Now I'm thinking of stopping since I've really sensed my breathing becoming shallower than usual and had to let it go, and get back to my earlier levels of lung health. Thank you r/stopsmoking for providing me the grit and motivation.

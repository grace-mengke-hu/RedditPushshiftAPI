I'm quitting smoking cigarettes now but i have questions about other recreational drugs and tobacco in their respective spheres

Question number 1...

I have historically really enjoyed smoking weed,  definitely chilled me out and improved my social skills prolifically. I'm cutting back on it these days as I'm trying to finish writing a thesis,  but i know there will be a time where i wish to get recreationally stoned. I always mix with tobacco. You see the problem,  right?

Do you think i should try smoking green ( i personally think this really sucks)? Move entirely to edibles? Or is it the case that if i smoke a tobacco mixed joint I'm really done for?

Note i've smoked dope very regularly for about 7 years and cigarettes very heavily  since starting (earnestly, after 7 whole years) just 18 months ago when discovering it was actually the nicotine i enjoyed so much in the joints.

Second question is i have a music event on where i plan to take mdma to celebrate finishing the thesis and a bunch of friends will be coming. Is it going to be hard to not smoke if I'm gurning? I will be about 45 days quit by then


I'm really thankful for honest replies from those who relate

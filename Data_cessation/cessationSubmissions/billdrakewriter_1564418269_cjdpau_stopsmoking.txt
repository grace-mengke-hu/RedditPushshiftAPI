Seeking tobacco pesticide book reviewers

Nicotine addiction is only one reason, and not the most important reason why quitting is so difficult. Toxic addiction to a hidden unregulated cocktail of insecticides and fungicides in every tobacco brand is a far more potent addiction. In other words, pesticide withdrawal is a hidden, potent part of the challenge of quitting. It is, based on rather extensive chronic pesticide poisoning research, more powerful and more dangerous than nicotine withdrawal.

 "Smoke No Evil" is a new, fact-based analysis of pesticide contamination of tobacco products and the associated hidden health risks. This book is self-published on a zero budget. I'm looking for reviewers who have a reason to care about this issue, which is a big ho-hum to the general public. For smokers, as you may agree after reading, it is life and death.

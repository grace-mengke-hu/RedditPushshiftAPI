1 year and 35 days- smoke free!

I never thought I would quit smoking. I struggled with being a smoker for 3 decades - knowing it was killing me, hiding it from most people (as best I could), lying about how much I smoked,  buying every pack with a vow "THIS will be my last pack". It's called *cognitive dissonance* and this affected me at on a core level, bathing my whole life in a mild dishonesty and self-loathing...

How I finally quit... one day I realized that I had never allowed myself to even think about a future self. Smoking was, for me, part of a larger personality disorder that is beyond the scope of this discussion, but the central thing was not ever conceiving of a future self that would be grateful to the present self for quitting smoking... 

The benefits of being a non-smoker are simply amazing. My present self is now grateful to that past self who quit smoking - especially because the $$$ I saved allowed me to get my (used but awesome) dream car a month ago. (Whenever I bought cigs, I also bought an energy drink or two, a snack, something I did not need so that I was never just running out to buy cigarettes).

If you are on here seeking support you are headed in the right direction and do not ever give up on quitting --- your future self will be very, very grateful. I know it.

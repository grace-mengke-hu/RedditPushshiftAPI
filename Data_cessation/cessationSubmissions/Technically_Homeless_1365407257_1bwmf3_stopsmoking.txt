So I just quit smoking and need some advice

So guys I'm coming out of a one week food poisoning/tract infection and havn't smoked for the entire time. I made the decision to quit smoking completly and have already had a tough time, so I broke my last smokes and threw them away. Been clean over a week now but where do I find the strength to keep going? All my friends, including girlfriend smokes and is showing no signs of quitting and I am also a regular user of weed(before sickness 5+days a week). 

Thanks from Sweden

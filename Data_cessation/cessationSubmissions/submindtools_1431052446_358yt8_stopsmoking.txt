The Chemical Harder to Quit Than Nicotine!

There is a chemical in cigarettes harder to quit than nicotine.  Do you know what it is?  This is something cigarette manufacturers don't want you to know, because if you did, it would be much easier to quit smoking.  It's sugar!  Every time you take a hit off a cigarette you are getting a huge and immediate sugar rush.  In some cigarettes, sugar is the main ingredient after tobacco.  When you smoke a cigarette and get the sugar rush, it brings you up.  Then, as time goes by, you start to go through minor sugar withdrawals.  What will make you feel better?  That's right, have another cigarette!  When you quit smoking, the sugar withdrawals make you feel like crap.  So when you choose to quit smoking, start off using a sugar replacement.  It could be gum, hard candy, or even carrots which have a good amount of sugar in them.  When you have the craving for a cigarette, use your replacement sugar for a little while to give your body the sugar it needs.  Do this for about two weeks and then start to tapper off of the sugar replacement.  Your withdrawals won't be as harsh, and quitting will be much easier.  Of course, if you have any concerns with this method, check with your doctor first.  Reply with any successes to motivate others to give this a try.  I wish you success in quitting smoking!

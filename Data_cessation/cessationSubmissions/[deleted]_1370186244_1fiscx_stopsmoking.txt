Advice on how to stay quit with a heavy smoker room mate

I'm on vacation in my hometown and decided to quit two days ago after having only one cigarette at 11:30pm. I've quit for 3 months last summer when I was working abroad but i jumped back on the bandwagon once I moved in with said roommate. I'm going home in a few days and I'm worried it will effect my quitting. I've always been a social smoker and sometimes my room mate takes it personally when I don't want a cigarrete. How do I stay motivated?

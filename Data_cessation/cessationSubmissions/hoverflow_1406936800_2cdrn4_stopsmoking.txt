I had 2 rollies after 16 days - is it possible to continue the quit?

Hi guys, I am really embarrassed about it, but I went to a pub with a smoking friend and I caved. I had 2 rollies. I relapsed, but I want to continue my quit. I did reset my badge. Is it possible to still successfully quit after that? Did any of you relapse and manage to continue their quit?... I really feel horrible about this stupidity :(

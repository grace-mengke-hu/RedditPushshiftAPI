Quitting with Alan Carr!

I was going to quit on Monday, for the billionth time. I've been dreading it. No one actually believes I'll quit anymore, so I've been hiding my smoking from everyone. I even stopped dating, who wants to date a smoker? 

I've been miserable. 

On Thursday, I bought Alan Carr's book on a whim. I thought, I've tried all these ways of quitting, might as well try one more. I read it. It wasn't literature by any means - it read like an uncle or a friend having a conversation instead. Parts of it were really funny. 

I haven't had a cigarette in 38 hours, I haven't gone this long since I was pregnant with my 9.5 year old (did not smoke during the pregnancy), and I haven't had *one single* craving or pang or pain or sad moment about not smoking.

I find cigarettes foul, smelly, expensive death traps. I couldn't be PAID to smoke at this point. Ish. 

I just. Am a nonsmoker now. I love it! I'm celebrating and happy!!!

For the record, I smoked for over 20 years! 

If you're struggling, I'd say try the book. Nothing to lose but about the cost of 1 pack of smokes, so might as well. 

You may end up getting your life back, like me!

Day 17 coughing

Today is day 17. I'm so glad I've made it this far, and my cravings are becoming few and far between, and mostly fleeting. I even described myself as a non-smoker yesterday. Not an ex-smoker, I said the words, "but I don't smoke, so..." and actually surprised myself. 

The one thing I'm having the most problem with is the coughing. I know my lungs are healing and everything, but the big gobs of phlegm in the morning and throughout the day is annoying. Also kinda tastes metallic? Anyone shed some light on this?

Anyway, this weekend I need some good juju coming my way. I'm going to visit some old friends from college and I'm not sure if they still smoke, but we all used to be chimneys. But, I will join you on not smoking today. Not a single puff, ever. Enjoy some fresh air, friends!

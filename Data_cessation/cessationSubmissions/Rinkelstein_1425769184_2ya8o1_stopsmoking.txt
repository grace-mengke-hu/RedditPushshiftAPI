Today makes two weeks.

Got busted by my wife. I had been smoking for two years behind her back. I finally slipped up. I had been wanting to quit, but now I don't have a choice. I feel pretty guilty to lying to her as long as I have. That being said, this is the first time I've ever been able to quit cold turkey.

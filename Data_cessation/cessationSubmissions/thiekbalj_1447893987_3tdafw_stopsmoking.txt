Serial quitting

I'm done, joining you all, smoked my last organic American Spirit a couple of hours ago. Healthy to the end LOL. I gave cigarettes up before my son was born, lasted 14 months; now he's 3. For the past 2 years I've 'quit' every day. Always leaving a small crack for nicotine open, usually in the AM. Smoke a few, throw them away. Every day (almost). For two plus years. I don't have money like that to spend (not by a longshot!). Over these last 2 years, I feel like I know intellectually (a small part of our human endeavor with an addiction like smoking I believe) every angle. But the most important one, not leaving that crack open AT ALL, not taking one puff...this has been my struggle and I imagine it is for some others out there. So fellow serial quitters--let's get it done with! Thank you stopsmoking sub reddit. Onwards

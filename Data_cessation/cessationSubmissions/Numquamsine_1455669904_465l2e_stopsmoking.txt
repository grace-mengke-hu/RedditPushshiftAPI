Thinking Out Loud

Remembering the severe tightness in my chest 2 days ago makes me wonder. Getting to work and talking to myself, smelling the breath from my mouth, I know I have mild gingivitis at least. Getting winded from scraping the ice off my windshield, or taking the groceries up one flight of stairs... These dark circles under my eyes are just more proof of what my dad once said: "you are not built to be a smoker."  

I've tried going cold turkey and I went into the deepest darkest depression that I've ever been in, nearly destroying everything that I gained. I've tried chantix and I've gotten violent to the point of punching a hole in a wall and threatening a loved one's sense of safety with my violence. 

I have a good job now, but it's very stressful. I have a lot of positive things because of it, but I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what will happen. I'm afraid of undoing everything I've achieved because or the inevitable outbursts that will happen when I try to quit. 

I feel completely trapped. I need help. And I don't know where to turn. I don't know what to do. I need help.

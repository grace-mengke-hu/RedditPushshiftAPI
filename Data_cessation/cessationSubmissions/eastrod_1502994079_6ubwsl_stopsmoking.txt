Day 3 and still holding out

Hey guys, I just recently gave up the darts on Monday, the day before my 33rd birthday. I have a 10 month old daughter and have cut back significantly from a pack a day to less than 10 a day since she was born. Now I'm at the point where I felt I needed to rip off the bandaid and get off them for good. 

Currently using the patch - started at step 2 since I wasn't smoking too much before. So far so good! I had a rough first night and following morning but I held out and it got better. 

Wanted to share my little bit of success because it helps me acknowledge it for myself and may help others in a similar situation.

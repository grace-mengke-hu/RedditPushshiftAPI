Coming up on a week.

I'm cheating a bit with this post, since I won't officially be at a week until well into the day tomorrow. Still, to have gone this long without smoking is something I have only accomplished once or twice since I got up to a pack a day over a year ago, and this time in particular I just feel very happy to be free. I have dealt with the urge to smoke, but I would rather sit through a few minutes of agitation and come out successful than to deny those temptations even exist up until the moment I light up again. In the aftermath of my first real breakup, it has felt very good to use the power of choice to do something other than destructive with my body. I would love to say I've overcome all my substance issues, but it isn't true. Still, having gone this week without smoking pot or cigarettes, it's nice to feel good about something I've actually done rather than something I have no control over. I want to live, and it's nice to actually live like that's a sentiment I take seriously.

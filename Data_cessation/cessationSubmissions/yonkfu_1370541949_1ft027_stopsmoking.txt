I feel so week today

I read Allen Carr's book and the first two weeks I was fine. I went out for drinks with some friends on the weekend and some nice lady put a lit smoke in my hand to hold. So I smoked it :( 
The next day I smoked and Monday I stoped again but had another on Wednesday night. Why do I feel so week about this, What can I do to stop now?

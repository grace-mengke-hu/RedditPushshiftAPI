Revelations 2 days in

So I fell sick a day into quitting smoking. The cold & sore throat really remove whatever nicotine pangs I have felt before when I have got to this stage. Once or twice a day now I still catch myself thinking "a cigarette would be nice now" and made me realize just how addicted I am to the f*cking cancer sticks. I still don't understand how or why cigarettes are legal.

New here. Great grandfather, grandfather, and father all died from smoking.

My grandfather died of smoking related cancer. My father recently died of lung cancer from smoking. I heard that my great grandfather died of smoking related causes, but don't know the details. Why I didn't quit immediately when my father died I don't know. I have quit for a week or two weeks many times but I want to do it this time. Last night I threw away half a pack, and I just pulled them from the trash and chain smoked the whole thing. It's 3:00 am. 

Tomorrow it starts again, there are none in the house and I just have to not go buy them. I'm also two weeks into not drinking, but this 'deal with one problem at a time' attitude has cause alternating between the two in the past. Quitting drinking was actually my excuse to start again last week, I figured that whatever I had to do to not drink was ok- even going to buy cigarettes. It didn't help. I'm still sober, but the cigarettes didn't make anything easier, they just made me start slipping into feeling like shit again. If anything, that makes me feel defeated and jeopardizes my sobriety too. If I'm going to be sober, I should experience all the benefits. That means health. It means not throwing money at addictions every day. It means being able to run and not feel like shit. Quitting one doesn't make it ok to do the other. I just have to do both and have a decent life.

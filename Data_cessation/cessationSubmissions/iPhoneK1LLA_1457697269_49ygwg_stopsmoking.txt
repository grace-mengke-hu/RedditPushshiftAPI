I haven't smoked in three months... Kinda.

So I used to smoke about 20 a day for 5 or so years of my life.

Within the past 8 months I've been smoked marijuana on an almost daily basis (only in the evenings - 2 joints), and within the past 3 months I've cut out tobacco completely.

This includes using tobacco with my marijuana (in terms of mixing with loose tobacco and tobacco blunt papers), and I'm not only using RAW organic papers, RAW roach cards and a little bit of organic tea as a filler.

I haven't craved a cigarette in as long as I can remember and the thought of it makes me feel a little bit disgusted.

If I go without smoking my green for a week or two due to various reason, it's now not a bother as much as going without smoking cigarettes was. I don't smoke at weekends because generally I'm with my girlfriend and her parents aren't a fan, which is perfectly fine.

I'm not saying this is the right method for everyone, but it's the method I fell into and I haven't looked back. 

I'm spending much less now that I was buying cigarettes, my back ache is relieved, and I can get to sleep easily in the evenings too.

Just thought I'd share my story!

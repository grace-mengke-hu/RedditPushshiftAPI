This morning's "lung cookies' made up my mind.

I've been smoking coming up on 11 years. I quit once for about 2 months, during which I used chaw/chew instead. Currently I am at a pack a day, but it is more like a pack in a 4 hour sitting. It's become routine for me to pound through cigarettes like they are going out of style while I play video games after work.

Last night I was up later than usual, and so I took in more cigs than normal. This morning I really felt it, and have been having rasping/wheezy breathing, as well as some uncontrollable coughing. Enough is enough, I feel bad enough about myself and my position in life, I don't need to have trouble breathing on top of it all. 

Cigarettes are no help to me. I am now a non-smoker. 

I can't do this alone though, so I picked up the First Step (10 cigarettes or more a day) of the patch plan. They say one every 24 hours, and while I had my last cigarettes less than 12 hours ago, I threw it on because the cravings were there.

I know that if you want to quit something, you should just do it, and not tell anyone about it, but I've got no one to hold me to my decision. My dog doesn't judge me for smoking, and my roommates wouldn't hold me to it even if I asked them to try and help. 

So here I go! It's been 10.5 years and all I've got to show for it is burn holes in my upholstery, ruined clothes, ashes all over my basement, bad breath, stained teeth, a cough that makes me sound 90, and not to mention I started when it was about $3 a pack for me, and now I'm shelling out twice that! That's easily my student loans.

I'd say wish me luck, but it's not luck. It comes down to me making the right choice when it counts. I guess coming here for motivation and to post progress (and set-backs, but hopefully not!) will help me stay motivated. Next step is to get on a better diet and start working out...but one step at a time.

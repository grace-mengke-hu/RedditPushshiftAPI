Failure to launch, again and again and again.....

I used to browse this sub more than a half-year ago, and its been on my front page this whole time, and Ive told myself I was "quitting" every day. Except every time I said it i went up 20 minutes later to light one up. But here I am 7 months later, still smoking and still hating it, Im starting Allen Carrs book, and Im ready, wish me luck

Just Crossed off my 5th Victory(Day) resisting the Invaders of the Smokey Kind. Withdraw Ain't S#!%

5 days in and I can start to feel the nicotine giving up its pesky fight for my body. It still sucks but I can't help but smile when my friends say they feel weird smoking around me when I'm not. They ask "*are you sure you are fine with us smoking?*" The only reply I give is "*Smoke'em if you got 'em*" Then they always ask me why I grin. I say no reason but **truth be told I love when the cravings hit like waves**. It tries to beat you and break you but, I can't help but feel accomplished when I identify the craving and then destroy it with logic, persistence, and of course reddit. I always think "*you have been through so much worse and achieved so much more*." and **my biggest reward is when I get to cross off another day unbound by poisons.** When midnight rolls around I finally get to chalk up another victory for the home team. I actually get excited when I cross off the date on my calendar, which acts as a scoreboard, it really motivates me. I can truly see who is in control, Who really runs the show and Who is going to win. I know I can do this I am just very worried about this weekend. See I go to WVU and I know that I'm going to be drinking a lot this weekend, come on its a home game weekend. I have drank a few beers on Wednesday and Thursday nights to get myself ready. It appears that my determination to win this war only gets stronger with every sip. I'm no alcoholic but I am taking precautions because I know that drinking could sabotage my abstinence from the smokey ones. If anyone has any tips (refraining from drinking just isn't an option) do tell. O and to **anyone on days 1-4 You can do it** 5 is not bad at all, its mostly situational cues that continue to tempt me instead of the periodical craving that strikes randomly. Many thanks to the wonderful people on this sub reddit. I always know I can relate to people in my exact situation and read inspirational posts that are keep me on the right path. I can really say that reddit is my NRT... **I switched from nicotine addiction to Reddit Addiction and I'm just fine with that** 

P.S. I am just Counting down the days till the ultimate distraction/new era of Gaming that is GTAV. I suggest this strategy to anyone looking for a good time to quit.

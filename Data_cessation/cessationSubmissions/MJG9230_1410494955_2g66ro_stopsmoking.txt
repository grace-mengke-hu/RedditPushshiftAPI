Physical withdrawal?

33 year old here, been smoking for the past 15 years. Tried to quit a bunch of times. Tried the patch and gum. No luck there. The best I have gone without smoking was 3 months on a bet with a friend who was trying to quit caffeinated pop. 

The last few times I tried to quit I haven't been able to last 24 hrs. Dealing with the mental cravings is something I can deal with. My problem has been my stomach going batshit crazy. More often I end being horribly constipated and feeling bloated/nauseous. A couple of times I ended up getting the runs.

Over the years I have gotten into the habit of smoking every time I go to the loo and my brain seems to have made this connection between a smoke and taking a dump. Also, maybe the fact that I smoke about 5 cigs between waking up and leaving for work about an hour later(first smoke is as soon as I wake up) has something to do with this.

Sorry for the wall of text. Just that I am kinda sick of trying to quit and then having to deal with this shit (pun not intended) . Anyone else who has had a similar experience and managed to deal with it?

Shoutout to whoever came up with NOPE

I read this on here and it really really works. I am on my 6th day and have crazy cravings by the time I hit 3 PM but every time, I would just repeat the mantra (not one puff ever) to myself and I see willpower winning over the cravings.. Kudos to whoever you are.. You are a lifesaver!!

Its different when you quit vaping vs cigarettes

Everyone on here is great! And I'm so happy to hear all of your stories of progress and to read all the encouragement if someone has a slip up. It is hard though reading through the positives of actually quitting smoking like.. better taste, smell, not stinking, etc. because none of those are positives for me. I quit ACTUALLY smoking over a year ago. And I was vaping ever since. But, I wanted to quit nicotine and not be an addict of anything. And the only positive I can think of is saving money.. which.. I was only spending $30 a month. It has been ALMOST a month of absolutely no nicotine and no vaping. I haven't pick it up in almost A MONTH! But like now.. when I'm having a really bad craving.. the only positive I can think about is.. I'm saving $30 a month.  Can anyone else relate? I totally understand this is to quit smoking. Like, actually smoking not necessarily nicotine. But, I need pointers on how to convince myself vaping is bad. I keep telling myself why go back after a Month? Even if I get 0 nic? It tastes good, it gives me something to do when I feel awkward/bored/ whatever. Okay, I'm just ranting.. trying to power through this random tough nicotine  craving. Sorry for wasting your time if you actually read this.

Been over a month..

I haven't had a cigarette in over a month.. and today is my 2nd day off of nicotine patches.. all i want is a cigarette.. every thing is annoying the absolute hell out of me. 2 hours until im done with work and hopefully these cravings subside a little.

Thanks for listening to me complain :)

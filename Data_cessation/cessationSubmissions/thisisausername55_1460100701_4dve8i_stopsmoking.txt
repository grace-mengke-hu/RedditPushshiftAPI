Started smoking again - 6 months after quitting.

Lately my stress levels have been off the roof, and I even had several dreams where I was smoking. Few days ago I bought a pack, almost smoked it, but in the end of the day I felt physically sick and threw away the pack.  
But since yesterday I've been smoking regularly and even worse I don't think I'm going to quit this time. As a bonus I think the infection I was recovering from is now resurfacing. How to convince myself to stop? Should I wait a few weeks or a couple months to get better emotionally before quitting again? It really helped calm my nerves.

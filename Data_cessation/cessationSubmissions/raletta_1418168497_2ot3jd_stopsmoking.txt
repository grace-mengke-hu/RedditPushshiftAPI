Healthy Loop

Yesterday I wanted a cigarette, instead I did 20 min of Pilates (normally I am super lazy and don't do any exercises at all). Because of that I woke up before my alarm clock rang today and was so full of energy that I thought I overslept and had to check the time twice (normally I am always tired and hate getting up).. Because of that I was happy and productive today and didn't want to smoke. Hope this loop will continue forever. :D

I'm flying international tomorrow and think it's a shame not buying duty free cigarettes

For the past two days I've been thinking I could buy 200 cigarettes for $30, smoke them and then quit again. 

I'm thinking it's a wasted opportunity not to buy them!


UPDATE: I picked them up, put them down, picked them up, the lady told me it was buy one get 1/3 off another carton.. 400 cigarettes for $50!! I walked away.. Didn't buy them, instead sat in Starbucks and tried to read my book and didn't go near Duty Free.. Thank you all for your support and scolding.

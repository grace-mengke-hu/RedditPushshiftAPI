question for patch users

Just removed 7mg patch, today was day 3 on those, and discovered that my skin underneath was pretty red. That didn't happen with the 14mg patches, so I was pretty surprised. Doesn't make sense that a lower dose would cause a skin reaction if the higher dose didn't. Is it because of the size of the patch itself? 
Hanging on through some stronger cravings these last 3 days. Cravings had pretty much disappeared by the end of using the 14mg patches. Now they are back, but I was forewarned, and prepared. I'm praying they go away as quickly as before. I know I will have to do it once again when I'm done with the 7mgs... sigh. But I'm getting there! Yay, me???

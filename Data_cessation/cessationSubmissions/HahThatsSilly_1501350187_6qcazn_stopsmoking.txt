Today I decided to quit smoking, FML.

Hello everyone! I'm hoping this is the only time I'll ever have to post here, but if history is any indicator I'm sure ya'll will see me again eventually. 

I've been smoking since I was 13 (I'm 34 now). I have always enjoyed smoking. I don't know why, I just do. Smoking has helped me through some pretty shitty situations in my life. 

I've tried quitting many times before. I've tried the patch, gum, Chantix (makes me sick to my stomach, too bad because it works), vaping, etc. I've been successful for short periods of time. Sometimes only a few days, other times 6 months. I've never been longer than that, though, because I've always really really really enjoyed smoking. 

Last night, however, that all changed. My son was walking around the deck at our lake house, sucking on a lollipop. When he finished his lollipop, he held the stick like I hold my cigarette and said "this is my cigarette!". My daughter proceeded to copy him. 

I don't enjoy smoking anymore. I just smoked my last, hated it. I'm hoping this means I'm now, finally, ready to actually quit. Today will be easy, always is. I dread my coffee tomorrow morning, though, without a cigarette. I dread the monster I'm going to be, for a few weeks, to my wife and kids. I dread knowing I won't be able to stop myself from snapping at the smallest things, blowing it way out of proportion, and causing my whole family to cry because I'm being a major ass. 

Gotta do it though, right?

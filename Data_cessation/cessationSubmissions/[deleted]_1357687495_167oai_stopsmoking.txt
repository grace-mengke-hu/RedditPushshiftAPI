Quit 3 days ago... feeling the cravings.

I wanted to quit smoking for years, but I just never had the balls to do so. Until I was just too lazy to get out and get a pack of cigarettes last Sunday.

Which means I went from a pack a day to totally cold turkey for 3 days now.

I just went to the bar where I'm a regular, and where they still smoke inside, and spend 2 hours there. I just came home craving, craving, craving. It was a good test and I did not have a cig, but Oh God, I wanted one.

I did allow myself to take a hit of weed with a pipe just yet (no nicotine), I hope this helps to keep myself off cigarettes at the hard times without going on a slippery slope.

Think I'm gonna chill out in this sub-reddit for a bit of support now. I really hope I will keep the quitting up this time. In a few days the worst will be done, won't it?

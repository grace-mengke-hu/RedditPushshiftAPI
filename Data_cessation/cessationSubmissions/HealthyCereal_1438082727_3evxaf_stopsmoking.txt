Here we go again.

So, this is hopefully my final attempt at this. Not just a rehearsal, the show. 

Powered by nothing but my will to change my identity. Oh, and the availability of nicotine gum, but so far I don't feel like it. I tried one on Sunday and they reminded me of Snus, a swedish chewing tobacco or something. Always found it disgusting. 

However, I'm looking to keep my will up permanently, any advice?

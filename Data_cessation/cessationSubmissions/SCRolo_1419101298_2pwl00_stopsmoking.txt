The worst

I work as a ski instructor in Austria and they smoke inside everywhere. Last year as a smoker his was fine. Now as a non-smoker it's torture because everyone smokes except for me. Only just managing to resist so I could really do with some positive reinforcement to help me not smoke. Sorry for the needy post.

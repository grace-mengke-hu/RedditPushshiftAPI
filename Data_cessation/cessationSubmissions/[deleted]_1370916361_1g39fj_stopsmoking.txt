It's been 9 days and all I can think about is... smoking

Does this ever end? Am I going to be craving these things for the rest of my life? I don't even LIKE smoking - I never did. I only smoked because I needed the nicotine. I understand that much, and yet all I want is a damn cigarette.

Please tell me this shit goes away, because I feel like if I ever start smoking again, I'm going to smoke twice as often.

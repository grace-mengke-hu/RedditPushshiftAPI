Love Triangle

I (30, F) have been smoking cigarettes since I was 22 years old, fully aware of the health hazards. I was prepared, I guess you could say, for a slow suicide. I have been in deep depression for most of my life, struggling to grow up in a physically and mentally abusive household. As I have become an adult, it became less about surviving my parents, and more about how screwed up I feel. Unable to move on from my memories. I felt broken. I wanted to die. 

What I wasn't prepared for, was the addiction.   Only 8 years of smoking had made me so dependent on lighting up. I have begrudgingly tried to give up in the past. But ultimately, my relationship to my Camels won. 

Two years ago, I fell in love with a man who I plan to spend the rest of my life with. He was a smoker. He quit a year and five months ago. He claimed it was easier than he thought it would be. He doesn't nag me for smoking but occasionally asks me to quit. He has begged me to quit with tears rolling down his cheeks. He doesn't want to bury me. I have tried so hard to quit. I keep letting him down. 

I'm getting the help that I need for my past traumas. Right now, I am pursuing treatment for PTSD. Fighting against the severe darkness I find myself in. This is my focus right now. I feel like I can not give up smoking RIGHT NOW. It gives me something to look forward to. It gives me alone time. I need it. Truthfully, it makes me feel ill. But, obviously this does not deter me. 

I don't know what I need you to say. I just know I need you to say something. Thanks for reading.

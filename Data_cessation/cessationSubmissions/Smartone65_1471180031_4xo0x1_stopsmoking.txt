I gave in... Need help.

I had quit a two pack a day habit for over 12 days using the patch. My boyfriend smokes and had left an open pack at home. I gave in to my craving and smoked four of them yesterday. Now my foremost thought isn't on quitting but how I can sneak more. Please help me get back to where I was - as a nonsmoker!!

First day on the patch!

So far so good! Patch seems to be keeping me calm, and I haven't really had to many urges today, while I am at work. I had cut myself down to a 1/4 pack a day before this, and the doc prescribed me a patch. 14mg for 3 weeks, then 7mg for 3 weeks, and then, I am praying, done!

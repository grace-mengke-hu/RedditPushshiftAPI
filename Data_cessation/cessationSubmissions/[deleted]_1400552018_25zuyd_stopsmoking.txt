17 days without any kind of nicotine and suddenly a craving like no other.

I would be lying if I said I have not thought about cigarettes these past two weeks. The thing is, it was just the cigarette itself. I had not had the urge to smoke any or even smell one. Then today, a craving hit me out of nowhere. I thought about those cool nights of going for a drive and smoking a couple cigarettes. One would think that after 17 days, the cravings would not be so strong. I'm not about to give up though. I've come too far to quit being a quitter. All I can picture in my head right now is cardboard cutouts of cigarettes popping up everywhere, and me roundhouse kicking each one of them to the ground...Chuck Norris style. 


On that note, some advice to the ones who just quit. Don't give in even when you think you want to cave. It's not going to be an easy road and there will be some bumps along the way (see above), but the idea is to kick this bad habit right in the rear and show it that, no matter how tough the world gets, you are tougher.

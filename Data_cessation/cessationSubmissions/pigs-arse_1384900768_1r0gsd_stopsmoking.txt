I started smoking again.

Thank god that's over.  I've been feeling like hell for the last 8 weeks until yesterday when I decided I would start smoking cigarettes again.  I'm tired of feeling irritated ALL the time.  In the last few years my life has taken a very unexpected turn.  At very short notice, I began as full time carer for my Father after he had a very debilitating stroke.  I expected it to only be a short term change, but its become apparent I'll be doing this for the rest of his life.  I've been hiding my smoking from him because I don't want to make his enforced quit more difficult.  For the last couple weeks, I have become increasingly irritated and got to the point that EVERYTHING he did and said annoyed me so much I could not stand being around him.  That is terrible, as I have full responsibility for him.  I could barely bring myself to speak to him at times... as for meeting his needs.. bathing, meals, company, I was doing it, but with nothing less than total resentment.  This cannot go on.  I know it's not logical, but I found that few minutes of escape I got from the total lack of control I have over my once fabulous life was about the only thing I had left.  When I stopped smoking, I lost that.  I don't know if I'm just making up an excuse to pick up my habit again... Does anyone think anything about this?  Am I just a selfish nut?  I think the best thing I can do to get through my life at the moment is just suck it up (so to speak!) and maybe attempt to give up again sometime in the future when I'm not in this situation.  Right now, I'm in a much better frame of mind than I have been lately.  And as an added bonus, I've put on several kg's and downed more wine than I care to admit as a result of this!

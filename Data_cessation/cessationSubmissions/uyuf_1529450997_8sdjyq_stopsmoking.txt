Sharing my thoughts. Almost 4 months in.

Hey guys, just realised I haven't posted here in a while and wanted to just write about how I'm feeling now I'm almost 4 months into my quit. 

For a little background, I quit using 4mg gum but have since stopped around 2 months ago. Haven't been using any nicotine products since I came off the gum. 

Recently, I've rarely paid attention to my quit. The fact that I'm going through a smoking quit doesn't even cross my mind. In fact, I had to check today to remember how many days I'd been smoke free. It makes me smirk at myself several months ago as I'd check the quit smoking app several times a day, watching those seconds tick up slowly and slowly. 

I'm at the stage now where I'm beginning to get complacent. It's almost too easy now. I need to just continue to remind myself that one cigarette could bring me straight back to square one. There have been times I've been very tempted, but I've managed to overcome these. 

If you're still in the early days of your quit, I can reassure you that it does get much easier. I feel that the initial buzz I got from quitting is slowly beginning to dissipate and I feel very much less like a recovering addict and more like a normal person. Which is nice, because although the days aren't as big of an achievement anymore, this is exactly what I've wanted all along.

My heart goes out to you all. Best of luck to everyone. It does get better.

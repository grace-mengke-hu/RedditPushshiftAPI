Not my crutch.

I'm writing this because I only just began my latest attempt to quit, and a bunch of shit just went wrong in my life immediately after. Usually in these types of situations I fall right back into smoking. But not this time. Smoking will not be my crutch. I will not allow my shitty present to destroy my future.

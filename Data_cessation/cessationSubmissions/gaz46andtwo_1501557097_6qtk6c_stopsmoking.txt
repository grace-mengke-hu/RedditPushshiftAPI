Day 8 with the patch...

I'm on day 8 of the patch and have only dragged on my husbands cigarettes a handful of times (maybe 1 cigarette in total drags) I'm also vaping but with a 0mg nicotine juice. The vape helps with the physicality and the patch helps the actual addiction. After this week I'll go to step 2 of the patch. (It does suggest using step 1 for like 7 weeks but that seems a bit much) anyone else use the patch? Is 7 weeks necessary? I will say that cigarettes are starting to smell bad. That helps a lot. To be honest I'm not really sure why I'm here, support I guess. I've been smoking for about 17 years about a pack a day. It's hard to stop. Well that's my 2 cents. Definitely feels like a lonely rough process..... 

Thanks for listening (well reading) guys and gals. Good luck to us all in kicking the habit! :)

First time I've made it to a week!

I'm the person who quits smoking every morning and starts again every night. But as a runner and a yoga teacher and a generally very health-conscious person, I'm so tired of feeling like a hypocrite and hiding this filthy habit and hindering my ability to progress in the activities I'm passionate about. So I'm done. Fingers crossed it sticks!

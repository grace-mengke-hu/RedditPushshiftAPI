24 hours w/o a cigarette

Hey all,

28 year old male, been smoking for a decade, about a pack to two packs a day for the past 6 years or so. 

Tried to go cold turkey sometime last year and made it 4 days, but ultimately i was suffering way more than I should (crying, irritable, couldnt sleep, eat... I was a fucking mess).

After another year of saying "soon" a friend of mine read the Allen Carr book and suddenly- hes 3 wees w/o smoking.

So... Longish story short. Read the book yesterday. Smoked my last cigarette 24 hours ago, and other then this strange dizzy feeling that comes and goes and an inability to really focus (Especially with driving), I feel pretty great and strangely enough, no part of me wants a cigarette. I am pretty damn hopeful right now.

For anyone going through/has been through something similar, how long does the "physical weirdness" tend to last? Not that I can't handle it, just hoping it goes sooner than later.

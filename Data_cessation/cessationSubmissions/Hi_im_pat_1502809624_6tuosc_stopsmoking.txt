Day 2, feeling withdrawls already

Its been almost exactly 48 hours since I had my last smoke. Man, what I wouldnt do for just one more (Actually, I'll tell you what I won't do.. I wont go to the store and buy more!) This is already crazy so far, didn't think I'd be feening like this only 2 days in. Also, just a quick side note, I am also on day 39 of NoFap, and that could be making it even more difficult for me. I feel very on edge. The #1 thing that is keeping me motivated right now is the money. I was spending $100-$150 a month on tobacco, I dont even want to think about the thousands of dollars I've already spent. I am looking forward to keeping that extra money around. 

At least I can already identify some triggers: I always smoked in my car. I get big cravings when I'm driving, so I took a fidget spinner (childish, I know, but it helps) and I play with that instead of chewing my fingers off. Also, first thing in the morning, RIGHT after I wake up, my very first thought is "I need to smoke". 

That is all for now, looking forward to the day where I'm not craving anymore!!!! Best of luck to you all.

Hello, I'm new. Really wanting to quit...again.

I'm a 31 year old male who's had an on and off relationship with cigarettes. Smoked lightly as a teen, then didn't for years. Started small again in my early 20's but "I wasn't a smoker". Got into a long term relationship with a smoker and naturally I began to smoke more. 2 years of 1 pack a day. A family member recently quit and she gave me her book, Allen Carr EasyWay. Read the book over a month period & put my last cigarette out in the back hardcover, wrote the date & signed it. 

3 years I pushed through every stress thrown at me without smoking a single cigarette. My breaking moment wasn't even that stressful. I was angry and disappointed and said screw it. Eventually I let those stressful and weak moments keep slipping. "Just one cigarette, I'm not a smoker". Then I would hide it, thus increasing my intake until eventually it was obvious that I was a smoker again. That was 5 years ago. 

Though I think it always sits on the back burner of a smokers mind "I need to quit", we ignore it. Lately my breathing has not become well. I don't cough but the wheezing is bad. I truly cannot take a breath of air without hearing my lungs and throat gasp for more. I need to stop again. The book worked great for me but that was 8 years ago. Currently it's in storage but findable.

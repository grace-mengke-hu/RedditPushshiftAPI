I just can't feel proud

Just before Christmas I decided that it was time to try and kick cigarettes, after 10 years of stinking like an old ashtray, being absolutely broke and breathless after walking upstairs, it was about time. I was never a heavy smoker, 10 a day was my average. I switched to an ecig, currently using a 6mg liquid. Now as happy as I am that I haven't had a cig for 51 days, I don't know whether I should feel proud or if I've just replaced one bad thing for another. Every time somebody asks me how long it's been since I've had a cig I have to tell them that I'm using an ecig because it feels like I'm lying.

Also I have dreams that I've smoked in and feel so disappointed in myself, does anybody else have these?

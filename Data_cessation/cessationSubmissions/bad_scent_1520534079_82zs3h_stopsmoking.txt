Does smoke odor removing sprays also neutralize the toxicity of the smoke?

Hello everyone. I have looked up the net but I couldn't find any info on this matter. I know using some machine filterers can neutralize the toxicity, but I don't know if this is the case for the sprays. I don't smoke myself but my mom constantly smokes in the house so I was wondering if I could get away with a spray instead of one of those machines.

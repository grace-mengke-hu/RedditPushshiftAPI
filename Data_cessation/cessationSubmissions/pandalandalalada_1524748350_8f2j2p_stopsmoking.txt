day three

todays the day i realised i dont know what hunger feels like anymore. im a fairly active guy and i dont get to eat much at work. during this latest bout of smoking i would smoke 6 cigs a day at work. i ended today without smoking any but with the same empty insecure feeling in my stomach. turns out thats hunger and wanting to smoke not just wanting to smoke like i thought it was. im going to have to relearn to listen to my body once the noise of this quit dies down. 

anyway better day today, work still sucks and im super hungry. but its getting better.

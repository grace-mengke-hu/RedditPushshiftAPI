Can't find "quantity of starting smokers by age group" statistic. Worried about a friend.

Hi Reddit,

I recently heard a girl friend of mine who has been with psychologal problems has started smoking, at age 28.

At first instance I'd say to start smoking at that age is pretty strange and if she has started smoking, who knows if she is also taking other things. 

Yes, I now I'm being alarmist, but she has been in psychological treatment and I'm a worried about her, and will talk to her about it. 

But before that I'd like to see a "quantity of starting smokers by age group" statistic (or something similar to that) in order to be more informed about the issue. And see if I'm being paranoid or not. 

Thanks in advance!

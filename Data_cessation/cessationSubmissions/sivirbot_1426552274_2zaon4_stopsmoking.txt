Well. I'm back for the second time.

Gonna start with the note I wrote to myself.

During my daily ritual of trying to talk myself into quitting smoking I was reminding myself that the few good things and people I've managed to find through this disgusting habit doesn't equal out any of the fact that it's killing me. 

To which my brain goes "What? Finding people worth living for isn't worth dying for? You would be the shittiest samurai." 

And then I legitimately thought to myself "Holy shit. I could be a Samurai if I kept smoking

So now I'm sharing this hysterical, yet unsettling, thought process as I come to a solid conclusion. 

Eff this noise. I'm out. 


I originally wrote this to share on Facebook, but wanted to share it with you all here first since I'm planning on stopping by a lot. 

I'm holding back on posting it to fb because I'm probably worried about if I don't follow through again. I quit for a year, but picked up the habit again about a year ago. This thought process was so ridiculous it made me stop on my tracks. The brain is a silly thing sometimes. Thanks for reading my post.

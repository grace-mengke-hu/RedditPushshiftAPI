I cut down from smoking 7-10 cigs, now smoke 1/2 cig or 1 cig a day, some days none. But I need help pulling the trigger and quitting completely.

(Disclaimer: I know most here are fanatical cold turkey quitters, and fanatical Allen Carr quitters. Yes, I've read/watched the Allen Carr thing several times, and spend time on whyquit.com; both are helpful, but I guess I had to do this in a different way.)  
  
The title of this post kind of says it all. I think I'm experiencing a fear of letting go of the option to smoke and making the full transition. I want to pull the trigger on this soon. 

Now when I smoke the very tiny amount I am smoking each day, I dislike it, force myself to pay attention to how much I dislike it, and how much better I felt before I smoked. I also force myself to notice that it didn't solve whatever problem I thought it would (e.g. make me feel better while drinking, make me concentrate better). I think this is sort of a torturous way to quit, but it's working for me--I'm step-by-step teaching myself that I actually don't like smoking.  
  
I know the danger is that I'll accidentally climb back to smoking at my old level, so I want to fully quit soon. But honestly, I can feel that my brain has changed majorly with regard to smoking in the last 2 weeks, and I am so sure I am ready to quit that I'm not really worried about that. I mainly just need some advice or helpful words about how to officially put a stop to it and say "no more smoking ever."  
  
Did anyone else step down like I did? How did you finally step down to 0?  
  
Thanks tons and good luck, everyone.

Sick of smelling like smoke. Sick of feeling the need to poison myself. I need help.

I'm 22 years old, a college senior, and I just can't stand that I smoke, but I seem to be able to do nothing about it. I tried my first cigarette in high school, and smoked for a couple weeks, but then decided it wasn't worth it. Once I got to college, and was around it a lot more, I picked it up, but it was only when I was drunk, eventually leading up to one or two a day, if that. I stopped for a while, but then I started working at a bar, and thats when I started buying packs multiple times a week. This continued for a few months, but I was able to quit again for a couple months. I've been on and off now for months at a time, but when I am smoking, its easily a pack a day.

I constantly smell like cigs. I'm always leaving the action of the room to go outside and poison myself. The other day, my roommate commented to me, asking how I felt about all the stuff I miss when smoking. He didn't phrase it like that, but it was enough to get me thinking. Enough is enough. I want to be done with this. I don't even know where to start.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get that out, and I feel like this is a supportive community that can probably relate to what I'm going through. Now that I've vented, I can probably ask for help better. I guess what I'm asking is what is the best way to go about quitting, because quite frankly cold turkey has not worked yet for me.

I've made it to 10 weeks (yaay) but..

I sort of crave a cigarette more than ever. 

I decided to quit in the middle of the night and that decision came to me as an epiphany and except from the minor "why am I wheezing" and "omg what's wrong with my lungs" I had literally the easiest time quitting. All my friends are smokers and I frequent a bar everyday so I'm pretty much surrounded by smokers. In the beginning it really didn't bother me. I told myself that but now I find myself feeling envious. I've somehow romanticized smoking and even though I took a puff the other day just to try and the taste and smoke made me cough and gag, I still want to do it in my head. 

Sorry for the ramble.. Just really want to know if anyone else has the same feeling and if it will go away soon.

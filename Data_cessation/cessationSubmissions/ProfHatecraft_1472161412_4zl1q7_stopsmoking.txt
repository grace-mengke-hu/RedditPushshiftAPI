Big hurdle coming up.

I had smoked a pack a day from 2007-2012, and quit for four months and three weeks when I went to Coachella and fell off the wagon.  I bought a pack and had been smoking in secret from my wife for the past four years, until sometime in mid March. Today I'm at about the same place I was then,  four months and three weeks with no nicotine at all (not exactly sure how many days)  and I'm going to Riotfest next weekend. It occurs to me that if I can make it through the ten days I'll be on vacation without asking any of my smoker friends for a cigarette, I'll have won, or at least beat my personal best. This is a huge challenge.  I've been thinking about it.  Thinking about how I could just have one (total bullshit), that I would just throw the pack away after that one (also complete bullshit). I'm going to stay strong. 

Also,  being in Denver I will combat the nicotine fits by smoking some legal herbal remedies.  A lot of them. 

This is the big hurdle.

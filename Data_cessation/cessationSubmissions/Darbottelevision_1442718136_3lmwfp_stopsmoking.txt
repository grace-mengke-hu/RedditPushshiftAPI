Day 2.....feeling rotten

End of day 2. This is my fifth or sixth time. I sound so silly saying this, but feel like I am losing my best friend cigarettes and my other best friend red wine(they were always together). I feel really lonely. Nobody but smokers understand this attached, sad feeling. I don't trust myself to go out or do anything besides lay in bed or go to the gym. I can't do anything without thinking about a cigarette. Just lay in bed or go to the gym. I just need someone to tell me to snap out of it

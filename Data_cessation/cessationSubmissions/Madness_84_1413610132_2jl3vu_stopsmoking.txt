Need advice on quitting.

Hello everyone. I think I'm ready to quit. It will be my first serious attempt and I need some advice. I'm a heavy smoker almost two packs a day for a while now and I feel so SICK of it. 
I've tried vaping before but not as a quitting method more like a cigarette replacement and it worked for two months but I started getting the worst acid reflux, some weird side effect I don't know so I I went back to the real thing. I also tried gum once a few years back but tbh I wasn't really committed to quit back then so needless to say that was also a failure. 
But I feel more determined now, I'm 30 YO and I have to beat this thing before it kills me. I have no idea what to do or where to start. 
I was thinking about hypnosis therapy, I've heard it works for some people. Maybe someone here can tell me about their experience if they have tried it. 
But any advice about what I can do about this would be much appreciated.

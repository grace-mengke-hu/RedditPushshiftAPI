Visualization

This is not my first quit.  I know what situations I tend to be in when I mess up.  I can see them a mile off.  So I'm going to start a simple daily exercise.  I will picture the scene in which I would smoke.  For me, the most challenging thought is being with my best friend who lives in another country.  We rarely get to see each other.  I always smoke when I see her.  So, I'll picture the scene.  I think of her smoking and I think of me pulling out my box of cinnamon sticks.  I put a piece of cinnamon in my mouth and chew it.  I am not smoking.  

Next scenario:  I am at my new job (which doesn't start until next week).  I mess up something drastically.  They all think I'm dumb and it looks like I may not get to stay at the job after all. Instead of  buying a pack of smokes on the way home, I stop into a boxing gym and sign up for a trial class.  I punch away my frustration and feel a bit better.

Etc.  I don't know if this helps anyone.  But for me, if I have already turned down smoking in my mind before a trial hits, it's a bit easier to do so in real life.

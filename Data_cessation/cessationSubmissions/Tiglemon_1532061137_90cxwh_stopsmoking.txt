I relapsed yesterday.. had two smokes after a 58 day streak of quitting.

I Never thought this will happen again I was so sure I will fight Through it this time. But after so many days of the initial few weeks I forgot that it is a struggle. I instead continued my routine when I had a trigger.. I was mostly upset about a situation that's not gonna change to the better, I can't do anything about it. But I continue to think further about it and dive into my minds dungeon. Before I knew it I was like ah I might as well smoke one. Then I had another one. But I'm resetting now. Have asked the reset count here too. 

I think I stopped hanging out here for awhile and forgot to be motivated to be quit. Since I live with a smoker seeing them smoke so many a day the idea that 1 a day is okay crosses your mind. I also was having a bad day but that does not change. The day stays bad until my mind can change it's outlook about the situation. Or to just ignore it.. Then it comes up like this to bite me. Better to face the nasty thoughts and find ways to deal with it. I think I found a creative way to face the thoughts. It's more fun and less upsetting. 

I wonder if all the health benefits I had so far is erased? And the money saved ? Can I still count it in. I reset my count on smoke free as well.

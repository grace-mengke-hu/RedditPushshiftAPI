One week!

$136 saved, 3hours time saved, and I'm going to live a whole 15 minutes longer than if I smoked.  And I feel great. I'm on the patch so I don't have to deal with cravings, just triggers.  I owe you all a big thank you for teaching me how to tell the difference. I've been trying to quit for a year now, and the longest I've made was a month. But something feels different this time. My last few relapses weren't nearly as satisfying. I hated myself for them. This might be the one!

I have trouble quitting because of my depression (vent).

That's an excuse, but I don't want it to be. I tried to quit smoking cold turkey but the side effects messed with me and I felt like I was entering a mental downward spiral. I felt soooo depressed and messed up and I couldn't handle it. After about a month with no cigarettes, I ended up smoking and vaping again. 

I'm back to just vaping but I'm on 1.5 and burning through a 60ml bottle in just a few days. Its blowing through my money and I'm tired of needing it to get up in the morning or to stop myself from having breakdowns. Nicotine has become a very bad crutch for me and I want to summon the willpower to stop it. 

I quit once when I was about 14-15 when I had just started, picked them back up at 18 and have been smoking ever since. I'm soon to be 24 now and I'm very frustrated with myself. 

Like I said, I'm on 1.5 nic in my vape juice now. I started at 16, I feel like I've come a long way. For that I'm proud of myself but now that the time has come to drop nicotine altogether, I can't seem to do it.

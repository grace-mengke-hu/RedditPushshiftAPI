10 days!

Hey everyone, just wanted to say thanks! I've been lurking here quite a while and reading all of the posts have been extremely helpful in helping me quit! The first three days were hell but I've been alright since then.

I have started practicing with a roller derby team in my hometown and am trying to use that as my new obsession/addiction. I think it's working out pretty well so far :D

Again, thanks so much, I never thought I'd be able to quit and used stress as an excuse to not go through with it. If I can stop, others definitely can.

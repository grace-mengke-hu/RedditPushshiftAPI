25 year old male, Trouble having sex after 8 years of smoking.

So recently a very dear relationship to me has fallen apart because my my complete lack of a sex drive. I've probably been like this for about 6 months or so. It's hard to judge. I've never had incentive to quit before but this a big deal to me. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced a dramatic increase in sex drive from quitting and if doing things like cardio has made the recovery process better?

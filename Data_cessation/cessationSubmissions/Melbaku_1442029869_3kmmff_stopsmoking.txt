82 hours!

So according to my snazzy little app on my phone it's been exactly 82.3 hours since I smoked. I had a really heavy drinking session last night with friends and had a couple of cravings. Used a no nicotine ecig (Parma violet flavour so no ciggie taste) a couple of times when the cravings were bad. I'm feel pretty proud of myself this morning, a night out has always been my undoing in the past.

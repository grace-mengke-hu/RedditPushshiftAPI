I've always wanted to do yoga... Now I can afford to!

I always thought I couldn't afford to take a class. Payday's coming up, so just on a whim I looked at the price of a class, and it's almost exactly how much I save a week from not smoking. :) It's fate!

Just wanted to share my victory with you all, because it's the first "holy shit I'm so glad I'm free!" moment as opposed to just a "I recognise that this is technically an advantage of quitting" moment. Keep it up guys, and thanks for all the encouragement so far.

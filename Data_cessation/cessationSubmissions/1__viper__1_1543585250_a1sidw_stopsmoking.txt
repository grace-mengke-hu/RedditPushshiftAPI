All cravings can be overcome!

I'm just shy of 2 years smoke free and just had the biggest craving for those disgusting sticks I've had in 12 months. 

I type this during this craving.

It's horrible to think how such a drug can have a hold over my mind. This has come from nowhere but my brain has just asked for that crap nicotine out of the blue.

I'm happy that this community is here for this moment to hear my rant and hold that shit at bay.

We can all do this no matter what stage we are at in our quit. Day one, day 500? It does not matter as long as you stick to the path of not taking another puff.

All hail ex-smokers, now non-smokers.


What am I? What are you? 

A non smoker.

We have this!

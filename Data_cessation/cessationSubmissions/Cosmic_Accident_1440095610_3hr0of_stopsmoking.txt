Need to vent, sorry

So I quit cold turkey 8 days ago. For the first week, I had no cravings, didn't even think about smoking much if at all. The only thing I noticed being out of the ordinary was how irritable I was. I was getting impatient and angry with even tiny things. But today has been a nightmare. I was craving so much that I actually went to the store and bought a pack and a lighter. I stopped myself from opening the pack, came home and put the pack somewhere not readily accessible. That's how hard it has been. 

I'm going on willpower alone and today is not bearable, I feel like the walls are squeezing me. I'm sweating, drowsy and generally not a very nice person. I used to think I was a nice person, jesus was I wrong. I would definitely not be my friend. I don't know how I have friends, let alone a girlfriend. 

Sorry for my rant, I just needed to write this down. I think hitting the post button's gonna help me.

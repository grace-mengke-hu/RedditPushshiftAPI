Quitting tip that's helping

I've found that on the occasional severe craving I try taking MASSIVE deep breaths, almost to test the amount my lungs can take and breath in and out. The urge to want to put smoke in them seems to go away quite quickly.

So yeah if you are have a severe craving, try taking some really deep breaths. Seems to be working for me.

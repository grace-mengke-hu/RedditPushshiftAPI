Day 1.

I tried quitting 3 times before. I never lasted very long. My wife and son are out of town until Thursday and I promised them I would quit by the time they come back. Well, there it is. Day 1 of try# 4. No patches, no gums, nothing. Careful, people! Approach with care in next 72 hours.  Wish me luck reddit.

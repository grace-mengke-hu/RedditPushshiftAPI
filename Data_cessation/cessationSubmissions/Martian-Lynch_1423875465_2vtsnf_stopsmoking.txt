What has you relationship with Anxiety pre-smoking, early stages of quitting and as a non-smoker been like.

Kind of a weird question. At least how I wrote it down. I'm now at around 38 days of quitting. My main reason for quitting this time is not health reasons it's due to anxiety. I started getting anxiety quite bad when stressed and I desired a smoke. I used to smoke not to deal with stress, but because it was enjoyable. When life got more difficult I began to use them as a way to cope. Which I believed ultimately began creating a much higher volume of overall and very frequent anxiety levels. 

I'm wondering if anyone actually found cigarettes to do this to themselves. If eventually over the course of quitting their anxiety and panic levels actually stabilized. 

I guess I can say after this time it's been a bit better, but I still struggle coping whenever even minor stressful issues occur. It sucks. Just trying to remember what it was like to deal with things normally and not immediately think smoking will help. Because it actually didn't really.

Stop before it's too late?

So I started hanging out with some friends after work and they offer me a cigarette every time. I declined at first but two days ago I said "Fuck it why not?" Today I smoked another one. I could never see myself buying a pack nor asking for a cigarette, but if they offer it's cool to just smoke it and talk. Was anybody else ever in a similar situation? Nobody in my family smokes.

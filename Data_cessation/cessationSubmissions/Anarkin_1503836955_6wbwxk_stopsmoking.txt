7 days is all it takes

[After 13 years of smoking...] 
Day 2-3-4 is extremely hard; however after that, it gets exponentially better. I am not changing my everyday behaviour, social interactions, whatsoever. Even went down with smokers once or twice to talk. Had some alcohol at Friday as well. All it takes is to change your mindset. I've read the A. Carr book, went through this sub's top posts and did some further research. As always: #if I can do it, you can do it too. This sub has helped a lot, even in read-only mode :)


/e: And yeah, thoughts like "without smoking whats the point of living" is unavoidable


"Don't make big changes. Make small ones. Lots of them.

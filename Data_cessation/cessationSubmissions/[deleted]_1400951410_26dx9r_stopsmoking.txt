A small victory

Until 6 months ago, I had been a smoker for 10 years. I've attempted to quit about 4-5 times (most of those attempts ended about a week in, longest stretch was about 3-4 weeks). This time was quite different in that I had decided to quit, not due to pressure or guilt, but for myself. Which I believe was paramount in my success (cold turkey success to boot).  

Like a lot of smokers, I have smoker friends. I had avoided going out with them for a while, as I felt I wasn't ready to face direct temptation. My big triggers are pretty common. I loved the pairing of good conversation and a smoke, as well as morning coffee, and most especially while drinking. 

Yesterday I was invited to go hang out with a group of friends, and since it'd been a while, I decided it was time to stop avoiding and start accepting that I'm no longer a smoker, and if I can go out with the gang on a friday night and not feel the old temptations, I can do anything.

I was very impressed with myself! I even went out with them on their smoke break! The smell bugged me a bit. Not cause it was a good smell lol, it was harsh and unappealing. But it didn't bother me to be near. A dude in the circle offered me a smoke, and I politely replied "no thanks, I don't smoke "

It felt great. 

Hang in there, dudes.

Bad effects made me quit. 1 hour into this.

Been smoking about 4 packs a week for the past 2 years and have had increasing number of problems popping up. About a year ago I started burping a lot after smoking and signs of GERD and aerophagia. It's also been giving me bad anxiety with chest tightness with abdominal and rib muscle pain, and probably what's causing the aerophagia and making the anxiety worse. Tonight I smoked some cheaper cigs from a brand I don't usually smoke and it hit me really hard. I'm done with this shit. I'm tired of feeling this way and it's going to lead to an ulcer and maybe even stomach cancer. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to fill the void? After gaming or read I get a little antsy and feel like going outside for a refreshing smoke. It's become a ritual of sorts. Would a nicotine-free vape help?

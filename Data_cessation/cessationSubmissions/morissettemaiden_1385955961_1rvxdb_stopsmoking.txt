Tonight is my last night and im terrified

I've been smoking a pack a day for 11 years. I've been planning this quit day for a month now, and tonight is my last night. I'm chain smoking the last of my pack as I type this. 
My mum is taking my 4 year old daughter (who is so wonderful, but honestly would be a reason I want to smoke.. Single mother problems ;) ) under her wonderful care for the next 3 days, and my plan is to seclude myself at my apartment with DVDs, exercise  plan, books, and writing material  and easily prepared food so I can be with just myself for a couple days. Ie: she's taking my car (I live in the middle of no where) and wallet so I won't be tempted to get any more smokes. 
I desperately want to quit, and would love if anyone had any advice to offer me during this time in my life. Also, if this plan I have devised seems like there could be improvements I would love to hear them. 
As a single working mom I feel like the best way for me to stop smoking is to actually have some "me" time to focus on myself, but I fear I'll be focusing all my energy on cigarettes to accomplish this goal. 
It scares me how much I am addicted to this, as I'm already in tears thinking about it. Honestly, I feel ashamed and weak that this is affecting me so much. Any support would be so wonderful. 
Thank you so much for listening. xo

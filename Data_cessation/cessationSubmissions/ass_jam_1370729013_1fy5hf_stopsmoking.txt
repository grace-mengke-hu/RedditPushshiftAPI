Addiction is not what i thought it would be

First off im  on day 4 of no smoking, and its not what i expected.  I have no motivation to smoke  , although i have an itch i cant scratch. its like a void that must be filled, almost like hunger but more similar to when i crave some coca cola. Its a very weird feeling, i find i have alot more energy much like an adrenalin rush. I feel almost ADDish. Its not a bad feeling just different than im use to, i have realized my occassional anxiety was due to smoking which would make me want to drink and smoke more  to subdue my anxiety. anyone feel the same

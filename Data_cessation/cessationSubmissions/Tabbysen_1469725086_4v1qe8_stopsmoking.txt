Wasn't that bad...

I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I found that the moment I realised that cigarettes weren't actually all that addictive, it seemed like the pressure lifted on me to be addicted. Like it removed the mental block, and suddenly I realised that I didn't HAVE to be addicted anymore, and I stopped smoking with no crutches and no cravings or irritability, NOTHING. This was after 10 years of smoking a pack of rolling tobacco a day (I'm a small girl). Now I might have the occasional one at a party like I did before I got 'addicted', but it doesn't make me feel like I want more. I thought this might prove helpful for someone with similar brain chemistry to me, or something. It was literally like flipping a switch.

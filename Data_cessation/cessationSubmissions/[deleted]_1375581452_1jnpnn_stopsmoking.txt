Making a shopping list, any tips appreciated!

My boyfriend is quitting cold turkey as we speak and is about 12 hours through it. He's sleeping now.

I want to go to the store and get him whatever he needs so he can wake up and spend the day in bed watching movies and hopefully not feel too shitty. Already got a subscription to Hulu.

I used an ecig to quit a while back, but still had some withdrawal. He'll be able to use it if hes desperate, but since he didn't have much luck with it he wants to go cold turkey and not rely too heavily on it. So far he hasn't asked for it, but might for his morning "smoke"

So far I'm thinking

* CranberryGrape juice
* Orange Juice
* Bananas
* Some menthol gum

We already drink water except for a morning juice, so that won't be an issue.

Anything else? Trying to think of what I can make him to eat. I'm not too good of a cook. I almost think it would be better if he snacked on something somewhat healthy all day instead of having a full meal, so he doesn't trigger too badly.

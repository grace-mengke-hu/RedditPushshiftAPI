A Smoking Dream

I had a dream last night: I ran into an old friend I haven't seen in years, and I was proudly telling him about my quit.  "Yeah man, I'm over 4 months now!"  I smiled at him, and he handed me a smoke.  I lit it up and we smoked.

I was mad at myself in the dream, and ashamed, but so glad when I woke up this morning.  Glad to realize that it wasn't real, that I don't **need** to smoke anymore.

I am so glad to be free.  I can't thank you all enough for the support and advice you have given me.  Thanks again.

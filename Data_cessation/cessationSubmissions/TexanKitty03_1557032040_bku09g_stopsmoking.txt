First steps to quitting

Hi,

So long story short almost a year ago, I was in an accident that left me with a disability. I had casually smoked here and there before that but ever since then I guess I really picked up the habit. Anyways, it basically hit me that I've been smoking over a pack a week for the past month, and that's quite shocking. I'm too young to be smoking that much and I need to quit. Does anyone have any tips on what the best way to start that process would be? I'd really appreciate it, thanks!

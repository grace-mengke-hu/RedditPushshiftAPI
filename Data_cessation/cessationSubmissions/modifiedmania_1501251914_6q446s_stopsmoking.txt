Just made it to 3 weeks!

I'm over the hump! It feels so weird to not have to step outside every hour. I don't have to split up my break at work so I can smoke. My anxiety levels have dropped dramatically, and I am feeling so much better overall. I don't think I'll ever start again, just because nicotine made me feel like shit.

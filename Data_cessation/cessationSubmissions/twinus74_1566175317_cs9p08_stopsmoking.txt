The Patch

I started the patch on Wednesday so it’s been 5 days. I did great the first day but I keep slipping. Had a heart attack over a year ago so you’d think this would be easy but after smoking for almost 30 years it’s really not. I don’t want to reset my time. I just need to stop picking up a cigarette. I went from smoking more than half a pack a day to maybe 6 now. Seeing my cardiologist tomorrow.

3rd attempt

I'm a little over 27 hours into my 3rd attempt. This time I put my fiance on alert and let him know I'm trying, and that I need help now. I was ashamed to admit it. Either way here I am. This time is different though, I just this evening started to feel my anger building. I hate just sitting around and it's been raining, and usually I clean. When I idle is when I start feeling the urges. The mania truly set in today. I feel adrenaline surges and distracted. I'm interested in playing video games one second and then the next few after I don't care and would just sit there. I cleaned and cooked, would sit and be angry, drew out my bills and a pumpkin. Got depressed, got angry again. I feel like my brain is overclocked, it's just burning. Almost like a headache when the tears start to well up in your eyes before bawling your eyes out, if that makes sense.  Now I'm just laying here, brain feeling like it's in a skillet.

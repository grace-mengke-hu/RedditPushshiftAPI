2 weeks. It is not the end of the world.

It's been 2 weeks, and I honestly feel great. I know everyone's experience is different, my transition to non smoker has been easier because EVERYTHING has changed about  my life starting with my job. Since my daily routine changed so drastically it means that my habits were easier to break and change. If you are waiting for a reason to quit take the next opportunity where it seems everything is getting turned upside down to use that as a positive instead of a negative. Instead of smoking MORE just stop. Everything is fucked anyway! It can't hurt! 

On a side note now I'm having dreams where i'm smoking and immediately crying or getting really upset for having let myself down. This time is different because I keep saying to myself "NO more, not even once, not when I'm drunk, not when I'm out, NO MORE" 

NO MORE.

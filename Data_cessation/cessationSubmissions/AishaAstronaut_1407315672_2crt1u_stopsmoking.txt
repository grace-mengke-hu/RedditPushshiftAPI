2 weeks cold turkey and dream me has quit too! :D

So you know I said about all those smoking dreams? They were good because they let my brain figure out that I wouldn't be happy if I slipped, without the slipping. BUT
Last night, dream me was in line with awake me.
I was in the car with my dad, talking about something to do with smoking. I think I was saying about how it's not social because you can't talk with a fag in your mouth (I talk a lot, you may have guessed from my million posts...) and I demonstrated by putting it in my mouth and saying *muffled* "who needs this? I dont" and then taking it out, saying "and I don't need these" - dramatically snapping the cigarette in half and throwing it out of the window.
Then I found another one and when I tore it up, it was full of pink and black fluff so I scattered it out of the window like confetti :)

So... My dreams are weird and overly dramatic, but it did feel epic :D

And it's been two weeks! Woooo :)

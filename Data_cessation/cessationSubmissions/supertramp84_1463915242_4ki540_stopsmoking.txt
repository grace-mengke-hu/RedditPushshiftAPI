Champix?

New here. Have been smoke free for 13 days using Champix and lots and lots of sparkling water. I have tried many many times in the past as i have ben a pack a day smoker for 12 years. Nothing worked. I used Champix last year and managed to stay amoke free for 6 months. Stupidly enough I was partying to hard over Christmas and started smoking again. 1+1+1... back to full time and it's 5 months later. As i have tried every stop smoking method there is i can't recomend Champix enough for those struggling with willpower. But be warned, the side effects are horrible. It depends how determined you are.

Question for people using the patch and/or gum

Since I quit, I’ve been using the patch and gum. I quit from vaping, but I was still super addicted to nicotine. The gum and patch seem to be working, but since I’ve started I’ve been having to go #2, like, a lot. And by a lot I mean during a one-hour period, I’ll spend about a half hour on the pot. Is that, you know, normal?

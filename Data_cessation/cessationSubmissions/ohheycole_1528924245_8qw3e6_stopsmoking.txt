How am I supposed to drive now? Serious question.

I’m on day 10 (whoo!) and I have a road trip for a friend’s wedding at the end of the month. I always chain smoked in the car. I have the patch, but is there anything to do with my left hand that won’t distract from driving? 

I’m hoping the new views will help, but it’s nice to have a backup plan.  Does anyone have any advice?

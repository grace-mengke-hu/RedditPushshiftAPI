1 day, for the last time

I swear I've been trying to quit since I started, to the point that whenever I tell my housemates that I'm trying to quit again they'll just laugh it off. I quit for 6 months using Allen Carr but then fell back into it about 6 months ago. I feel good about it this time, though any tips on making this time successful would be great.

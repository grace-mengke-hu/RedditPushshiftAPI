What were your first noticeable positive changes?

Hi all!
I’ve just finished my last cigarette ever 💪 and I was wondering if, for a bit of motivation and fun, anyone would be willing to share the first “this is great” changes they experienced. And if you’ve been quit for a good while now, what have your favorite changes to your life been? So much focus is on the cravings and tough stuff so I thought maybe this would be a motivating change of pace. 

I quit around 5 years ago for a year and I remember that within only a few days that yucky morning gunk in my throat was gone and my lungs already felt better on runs. Also - maybe this is a weird one - within a few days I could smell cigarette smoke again and how appalling it was - there was something really powerful in the realization that I couldn’t smell it before. My favorite change overall during that time was how much more energy I had, just generally feeling healthier than I had in a long time. Looking forward to all of these things again!

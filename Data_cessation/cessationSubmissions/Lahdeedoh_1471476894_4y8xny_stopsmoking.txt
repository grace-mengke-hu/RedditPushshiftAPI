This has to be it. I have to be done smoking. I'm definitely going to need encouragement and advice over the next few months.

I started smoking at 14 and have tried to god knows how many times over the last 18 years. I managed to quit for almost 2 years while I was pregnant and the first year of my son's life. He is 16 months and I don't want him to grow up seeing me smoke, or die from a smoking related disease. My SO hates it and I've been hiding it from him. It is ruining my life and I want control back. I'm hoping this subreddit can be a source of support. Thank you!

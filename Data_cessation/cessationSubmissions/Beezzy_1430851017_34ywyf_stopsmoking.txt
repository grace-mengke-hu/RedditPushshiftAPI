Alright guys that pretty much does it.

I had another stomach ulcer this weekend and smoking is a contributing factor so that's it, I'm fucking done. I've always made excuses to quit that I've never followed through with and I'm sick of it. Today is my second day of not smoking and it feels quite nice.

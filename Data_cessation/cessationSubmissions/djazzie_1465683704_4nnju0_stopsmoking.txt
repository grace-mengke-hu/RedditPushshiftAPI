Never been happier that I quit

So, I visited my dad this weekend, who's a lifelong smoker. His wife (my step-mom) and also a smoker had been diagnosed with some form of lung cancer (they don't know which kind yet, but from what they do know, it's not likely to be survivable given her age and overall health). 

Despite this diagnosis, she's still smoking. Not only that, my father is "down" to a pack and a half. They're both in their 70s and in poor shape. They get little to no exercise, eat like shit and are chimneys. 

Looking at them, I've never been happier that I quit. I'm middle-aged and working hard to get back to some semblance of health. I quit over a year ago, with a few slip ups here and there, but I'm so disgusted by cigarettes now. And I hope I don't get lung cancer despite the many years I smoked (over 20). I'm just so glad I'll never live like them.

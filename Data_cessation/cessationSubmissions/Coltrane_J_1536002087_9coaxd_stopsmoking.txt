On day 5

My last cigarette was Wednesday (8/29), today is my 5th day of cold turkey. Just wanted to say, if youâ€™re in a similar situation as me and are reading this, it gets so much easier. Day 3 and 4 were awful, my anxiety was through the roof. Today I finally feel more calm and not in my head so much.

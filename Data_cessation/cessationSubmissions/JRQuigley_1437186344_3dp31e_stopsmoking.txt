Just quit this week

Hello, so I just quit this week, last sunday was my first nicotine free day.

My wife suggested I look up a sub for this and yay, I found you all!


I'm quitting with the help of Chantix, it seems to be going great for me.  Going through lots of sunflower seeds though lol.

I'm 39 years old, started when I was 15.  Pack a day, give or take.  Decided to quit when I noticed my little boy started copying the things I do.  My wife had been bugging me for years to quit.  Well, now I'm doing good.


I guess I just wanted to say hi, I've joined your ranks.

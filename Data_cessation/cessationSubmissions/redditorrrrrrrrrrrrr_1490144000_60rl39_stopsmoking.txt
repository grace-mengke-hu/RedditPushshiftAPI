10 days later! Quit smoking the easy way is amazing!

So, it's been 10 days since I smoked. I stared listening to Quit smoking the easy way during gym on the 2nd day when I had bad withdrawal symptoms after quitting cold turkey but the book has somehow stopped that. Infact I don't understand why I should smoke. There seems to be no reason for it. 

That book is really weird because I thought it was unscientific but it has worked already. I think it will be another 6 days before I finish the book.

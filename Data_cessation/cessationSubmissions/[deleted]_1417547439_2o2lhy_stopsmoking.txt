Mental benefits of stop smoking ???

Hi guys.

After 10 years smoking cigarettes, (18 - 28) i decided to stop smoking asap.

I know the physical benefits of no smoking, we all know that. but, if you don't smoke these have some kind of benefits in your brain, in your happiness ?

i read that tobacco stimulates your brain power ...

hope your answers. thanks and keep on !

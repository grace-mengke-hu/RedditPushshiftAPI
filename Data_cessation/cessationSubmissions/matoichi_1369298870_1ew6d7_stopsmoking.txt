First week after quitting, mouth riddled with ulcers - anyone else get this?

Hey quitters. im on my 3rd serious attempt at quitting for good, having done two stretches of a few months at a time before. im just about to come up on 1 week smoke free and am in serious pain - mouth just full of ulcers out of nowhere. i never get them any other time, have had the same thing the previous 2 times i quit. anyone know if this is common or what is causing it (i assume something to do with sudden nicotine or smoke withdrawal) or anything i can do to avoid it? cheers!

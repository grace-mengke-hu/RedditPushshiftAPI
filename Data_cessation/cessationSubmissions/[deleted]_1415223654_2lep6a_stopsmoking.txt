Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I have a question about potential health issues..

So I'm 19 and I've been smoking four around 4 years, but the first 2-3 years were pretty light smoking, maybe 5-10 cigaretts per week. Lately I started feeling a wierd pain in my throat and lung every once in a while. It feels sort of like a slight burning in throat and wierd pressure in the chest or something (not a native English speaker, so it's pretty hard to explain exactly). It doesn't really hurt too much, its mostly just an uncomfortable feeling, but I'm worried if it could be a sign for something serious. I've reduced smoking a lot because of it, and I'm in the process of stopping completly, but I'm still worried about this. So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone had the same experiences and if anyone has any tips on what to do..
I'm guessing seeing a doctor would be a smart idea, but for some reason can't seem to get myself to do it..

Quitting smoking and the dopamine spike

Hey all, currently 3 days into quitting cold turkey after 10 years of smoking. It's very strange to be honest (I almost feel like my personality is changing), and the hardest part for me so far has been the lack of that lovely dopamine spike that hits you whenever you smoke. I feel like there aren't enough moments during my day that bring me that same visceral enjoyment (except sex...but you can't expect that on the same regular basis as cigs). Having never been seriously depressed before, I don't know if this is comparable, but simply the realization that that instant reward is no longer available to me is really difficult. Does everyone go through this, and if so, does the aforementioned realization stop mattering after a while?

Lungs do feel great though. :)

I don't think I'll ever smoke again

I was always very hesitant to say that, I tried to keep my mindset more akin to "I won't smoke this week-month-year" but it's been so long since I've thought about smoking that I feel this may be for good.

It wasn't easy, it wasn't overnight, but it was easiER than I thought and the changes happened way faster and were way better than I expected.

To all of you starting out, I know it's difficult but you won't believe the difference it makes in the short, medium and long term. Your body, your family, your friends and especially YOU will be grateful for your decision. The effort definitely pays off.

Coming up to 5 months

Still going strong.  I want to keep posting here just to let all you new quitters know that it very much does get better, and easier.  Although it does occasionally cross my mind, thinking about it day-to-day is almost non-existent.  Quite recently I was travelling in the car, and as I pulled past a car to the side, I noticed the driver was smoking.  At that very moment I realised it must have been a good few weeks since I'd even given it a thought.

This is on top of the fact that my wife is still smoking.  I wouldn't dream of asking her to quit, that would be entirely her choice.  My point here is that, just because she has continued, it hasn't in any way hindered me at all.  I do notice the smell, of course, but it doesn't tend to bother me too much.  I can live with it, and it's definitely not making me want to smoke anyway.  If anything, I think that it might be worse without the reminder of how bad it smells.  Given how cold it is outside at the moment, I don't envy my wife having to sit on the doorstep to contend with her habit.

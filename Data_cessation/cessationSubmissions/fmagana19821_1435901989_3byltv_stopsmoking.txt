I failed.

After 878 days of not smoking, I failed myself. I gave into temptation and I smoked again. I don't have an excuse. I wasn't drunk, I'm not stressed out, life's going great in fact. I don't know why I did it, I just did. I will be removing my badge and starting over. I no longer deserve that number next to my badge. 

To those of you considering giving into temptation? Don't do it. I have nothing but the feeling of regret right now. It's a really shitty feeling. Back to square one.

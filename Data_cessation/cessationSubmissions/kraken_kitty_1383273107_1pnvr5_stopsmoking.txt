Happy Samhain, and a VERY Happy Halloween! Stay strong!

I can't believe that for the first time in so many years, I'm going to be smoke-free for the new year :)  I know that there are many who don't have the same beliefs as I do, so I'll just wish y'all an awesome Halloween and a very safe night!



44 days strong, and I can breathe!  My fianc√© can kiss me without tasting butt and he can hug me without smelling an ashtray :3

Day 6 has turned out to be one of the hardest.

Started over last week. I had been smoking again for 1.5 years after quitting for about 2 years.

Days 2 and 3 were bad because of general frustration / aggravation level. 4 and 5 were quiet!? Day 6 has taken everything to a new level. I hate everyone in this miserable shitty world. Weird part is that I haven't wanted to smoke at all. I just hate everything. Anyone else experience this?

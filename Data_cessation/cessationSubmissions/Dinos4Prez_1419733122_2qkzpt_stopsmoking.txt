One week without a cig and I feel like crap SOS

Made it to one week and I just feel like it's not worth it. Any insight or advice or people who feel the same. I just still have the same outlook as a smoker: smoking is awesome and feels good and helps me make friends and blah blah blah... I just don't feel like "well gee isn't not smoking swell you guys". I wanna punch something ugh. Help?

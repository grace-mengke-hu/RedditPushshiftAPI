day 2

So I was going to quit on Marathon Monday as a Bostonian and I am sure you can imagine being near by that finish line that all was well up until the explosions and chaos. I got home and had a few drinks and had a rolled up cig from my neighbor who hand rolls his own. I had 2 on Monday, but have not had any since. I have to say, I am easily agitated and less talkative but I know this pang will pass. I have been able to get through workouts easier and less winded so my stamina is coming back which is great.

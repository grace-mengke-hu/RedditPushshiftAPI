Looking for some answers or advice

I had been a smoker for the past 5 years.  I decided to quit this year and so far so good for the most part.  I haven't had a cigarette and have been able to control even the worst cravings.  The hardest part for me is that I miss smoking.  Every time I walk past smokers having a cigarette and hanging outside of my building, I think about how I used to be there and I miss it.  Will there ever be a time where I find cigarettes as something I do not want to do? As something that is disgusting to do?  Prior to smoking, I almost hated smokers but now I just want to be part of the crew again.  How do I change my outlook?

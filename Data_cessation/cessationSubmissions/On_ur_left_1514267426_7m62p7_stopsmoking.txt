Time to get back to cycling

Stress and a new job caused me to revert to old bad habits. It's time. I've gone 4 days at a time and always grab one of my wife's smokes. I don't want to do that anymore. I'm committed. I will ride my bike tomorrow, look in the mirror and know that I am not smoking anymore. Thanks all!

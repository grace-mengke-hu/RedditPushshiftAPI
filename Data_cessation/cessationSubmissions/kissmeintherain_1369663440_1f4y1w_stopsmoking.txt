Smoke free since the 9th still feeling the withdrawal?

Hello I've been smoking for about 7  years and decided to quit this year. After going on and off I've finally been smoke free since the 9th. 

I was just wondering if its possible for me to feel the withdrawals? 

I understand how I can still get the cravings, but it seems like I'm still a bit moody and keep on munching on something.. 

I thought you weren't supposed to feel the withdrawals after the first two weeks or so? 

I don't know .... Sigh..

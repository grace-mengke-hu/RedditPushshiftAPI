Busy time at work. Want to smoke!

I work at a college, and classes just started. I was still smoking this time last year, so I am used to popping out for a smoke occassionally. Especially when it gets stressful.

I *think* I want to smoke, but I am telling myself that's just my brain remembering past instances and that I actually do not want to smoke. Good thing I stashed snacks under my desk. 

That's all! Just had to take a moment and remind myself I don't smoke anymore!

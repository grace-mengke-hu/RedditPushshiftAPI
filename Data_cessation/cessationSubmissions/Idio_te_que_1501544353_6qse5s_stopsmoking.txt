Just threw out all my tobacco, lighters, matches, etc...and my throat feels a bit constricted

Hi friends,

I have smoked about 20 cigarettes per day for the past 2 years. For the first year I was smoking packs and over the past year I've been rolling Amsterdam Shag. Over the past few days I've been worrying over some chest 'pangs' as well as a slight constriction in my lower throat.  Is anyone familiar with the throat sensation? I had a chest EKG 2 months ago and was cleared as healthy, so I'm not very worried about that. But my throat is certainly uncomfortable.  Its subtle but persistent.  It kind of feels as if I have a lump in the base of my throat, and it often feels as if it will be difficult to swallow. I also think it is affecting the strength of my voice. 

I'm hoping this is perhaps just a rawness from the amount I've been smoking over the past few days (I've bee drinking a lot = smoking heavily in rapid succession).  Regardless, I've just thrown out all of my tobacco and paraphernalia.  Happy this subreddit exists for support.

Thanks

Bought a new car, quit smoking to pay for it

Long story short, I've been smoking since I was 19 (now am 26). I recently had my car totaled and had to buy a new one. I upgraded to a nicer car as I'm in a better financial spot now than I was 6 years ago when I bought the other car. Because of this, I also re evaluated my budget and realized how much I was wasting on smokes. HOLY SHIT!! So my motivation to upgrade to a sportier car was to quit and save that money I've been throwing away. I don't need the money to pay for the car but I like to act like I do to motivate myself. 

I'm now 2 weeks in and am starting to feel the positive benefits from quitting. It's the first time I've attempted to quit where I began to feel like I don't want to smoke ever again. 

There's no real point to this post besides being excited that I feel like I'm making progress because I want to and not because it's something I know I should do. Anyways, happy holidays everyone!

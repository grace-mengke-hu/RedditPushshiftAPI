I'm on Day 13 of quitting cold turkey after 14 years of smoking

No stolen drags, no chantix, no nicorette, no snus, no vaping...just gave up nicotine entirely and it feels amazing.

I read Easy Way to Stop Smoking over the course of 3 nights and when I finished, I smoked my ceremonial last cigarette and that was that.


Not going to sugarcoat it, days 1-5 were very difficult and I had an extremely short fuse.  By day 6, things started easing up and since day 8, it's been a breeze.  I get occasional cravings  (usually when I get in my car) but they're short-lived and easily outweighed by my desire to never smoke again.

In terms of benefits, I have more energy than I've ever had in my life and I'm 32.  I went for a run for the 1st time in years last night and made it 3 miles without stopping once.  I did have a pretty intense coughing fit immediately after but I kind of expected it.  I bounce out of bed now and I feel like I have all sorts of time to get things done now that I'm not constantly waiting on my next smoke.

I really feel like I escaped from prison, especially having quit drinking and gambling as well within the last several months.


If i can do this, anyone can.  I truly felt resigned to being a lifelong smoker a matter of weeks ago.  I'm about to hit the 2 week mark and I couldn't be happier.   The first 5-7 days are awful but once you get over the hump, it just seems to get easier and easier. Good luck everyone!

Starting to believe

So far so good. The most difficult moments are when I've just woken up. Ah, that first cigarette of the day. The rest of the day is easier. I'm starting to believe I'm actually going to do this. Objectively I'm already past the most difficult moments. (Or so I'm let to believe from reading about this stuff) Who ever has a different opinion, please keep it to yourself as it would not help me. I'll stick to false beliefs if it helps. I visit this subreddit a couple of times a day to boost me. I wish everybody strength with their own struggles. I will not smoke today!

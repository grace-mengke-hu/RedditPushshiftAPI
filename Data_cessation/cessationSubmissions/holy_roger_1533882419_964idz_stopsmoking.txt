The Modern Cigarette......

A smoker smoking two packs a day in the 1940s would have found it easier to quit......

How is a present day cigarette different?

1. Ammonia..... Adding ammonia to cigarettes, referred to as free-basing of nicotine, increases the concentration of free or bio-active nicotine in smoke leading to higher and more efficient absorption in the brain. So puff for puff, the modern day cigarette delivers more of the addictive 'drug' nicotine in the system than half a century back. Body accomodates and adapts to this higher and easier to acquire dosage and the addiction becomes worse. Marlboro, apparently was the first brand to incorporate ammonia in cigarettes.

2. Genetically modified tobacco crop..... GM tobacco yields way more nicotine every ounce of leaves than non GM tobacco. More nicotine.....stronger addiction.

So a smoker doesn't really choose to smoke. He or she is a slave to wrongly utilised science. 

And us who are trying to quit are battling such factors.......Efficiently utilized chemistry and biology to enslave us. 

Imagine fighting a lightsaber with no other weapon than the power of conviction, self-belief and the will to be free.....the power of the mind. The mind being the greatest and the strongest asset that we have in this fight......

Say 'NO'.......Say it with belief, with conviction......the moment of clarity is just around the corner......

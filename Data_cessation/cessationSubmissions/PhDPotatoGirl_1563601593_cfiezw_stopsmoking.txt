Advice for negative thoughts?

Hey everyone,

I've had a few quit attempts and from each I've learnt what some triggers are for me and been able to overcome them. However, the one I've yet to conquer is the seemingly random onslaught of negative thoughts when quitting. To paint a picture, I'll make the positive decision to quit, the physical withdrawals don't seem to be a drama, I'm not doubting the decision to stop smoking, not stressed about anything but surprise, a thought will pop into my head that's like removing an essential brick holding up the unbreakable wall I built and it comes crumbling down. 

I know it's probably being caused by the nicotine withdrawal and the insecure feeling that comes with it but apparently I'm not good at dealing with them. I'm feeling good and revving up for tomorrow which will be day 1 of chucking those durries away forever and am expecting the negative thoughts but so far all I've got is waiting them out. So I was wondering if 1) did you experience this and 2) any tactics that helped relieve them?

Thanks in advance!

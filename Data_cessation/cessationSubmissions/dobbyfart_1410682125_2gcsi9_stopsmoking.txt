I can't believe I missed my 100 Days post!

I've been looking forward to it and I missed it by five days!

I transferred departments in the company I work for. It was a lateral move, so no pay increase or promotion, but the responsibility is much greater (not hard to do) and I really like the people I work with. I can't even convey in words how great it is to actually do work eight hours a day instead of minimize reddit and almost have a heart attack every time my boss leaves her desk eight hours a day. 

However, liking the people I work with and having *good* work stress is presenting a new set of challenges. I actually *like* these guys. I want to converse with them. I could even see myself asking them all out for department drinks some time. Two of them smoke. The person that's training me and my supervisor, and I'm sure more, but the first two are the ones that smoke the most. And they smoke *all the time*. It's probably about once an hour. 

I want to go with them! I keep thinking how upset I would be with myself if I gave in, and it saves me. It wouldn't just be a socializing cigarette. I would start smoking again and I do *not* want to do that, not even a little. But I am missing out on some of the socialization at work. I figure there's enough socializing to go around, and I can just suck it up, but if anyone has advice or words of encouragement, I'd love to hear it!

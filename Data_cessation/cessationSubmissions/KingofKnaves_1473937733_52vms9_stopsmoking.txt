It's been just over 22 hours since I decided to quit...

I've been smoking regularly since I was about 12. I'm 27 now and the effects are real. I'm in the military and my PT scores have shown that long time smoking is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. Who knew?

My issue is work. For the last  4 years, I've only smoked at work. My wife quit 6 years ago, so it saves us an argument about my health. I don't smoke when I'm on vacation or away from work. Only at work. My job is stressful but tedious. Getting away for 15 to smoke is the only break I really get.

Anyway, I've been lurking here for about 2 months and the stories I've seen have inspired me to quit. Like really quit. 100% of the time, not just on weekends.

How do you relax?

I'm 81 hours in and have been doing pretty well since the first day. My problem now is that I cannot relax. I'm the type of person that has to constantly be doing something. I used my smoke breaks as down time to relax and/or transition to the next task. Smoking counted as doing something in my mind, but just sitting down for 5 minutes doesn't and makes me more anxious. When I need to take a break is the only time that I feel the desire to smoke again so to fight that urge I don't take breaks at all. 

Anyone else have this problem? How did you get over it?

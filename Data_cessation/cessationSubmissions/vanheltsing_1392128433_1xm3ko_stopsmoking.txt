7 days, 17 hours, 15 minutes

I want a smoke... sometimes badly! I'm drinking a lot of water, and I mean a lot...

However when I feel I'm loosing it, I go to my quitnow app and this is the result.

In this 7 days, I have missed 
- 154 cigarettes.
- 2310 puffs and equivalent nicotine doses. 

In this 7 days I won
- COP$24640 or ~ US$12
- I don't stink anymore

So whenever you are feeling weak, do the math. You win a lot in such short time.

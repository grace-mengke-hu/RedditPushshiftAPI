quitting dip. considering e-cigs. good idea?

Hey guys, i've been chewing 3 times a day for about 5 years and want to quit. nicotine gum never helped and hear amazing things about e-cigs. will starting e-cigs bring about any new negative health side effects to my respiratory or cardiovascular system?

Stressed

Having a bout of stress right now due to multiple causes and appears to have come with a pretty strong trigger. Even though cigarettes are skimming across my mind I have no intention of ever touching them. Besides, I understand the true causes of my stress and worry. Sadly, I feel they aren't going to go away any time soon.

Anyway all this stress has enticed me to find an avenue to vent a little. So here I am, checking in.

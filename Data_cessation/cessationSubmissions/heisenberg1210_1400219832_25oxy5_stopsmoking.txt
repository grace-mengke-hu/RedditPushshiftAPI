Day 1 begins today - motivational reminders for myself and hopefully others too

So after smoking on and off for the past 2 months, I've finally made a decision to quit for real. I'm sick and tired of trying to quit and have it go smoothly over a few days, only to relapse and go back to smoking. It's horrible, and I feel like an utter failure every time I do. So no more.

Here's a list of motivational reminders I've made which I'm hoping will keep me on track, and I just wanted to share them in the hope that someone else might find them helpful.


1) I'm the master of my own body and I decide what goes in. These stupid sticks of dried leaves don't get to have any say.

2) Reduced stamina interferes with my fitness plans which I put a lot of effort and hard work into.

3) Bad breath and smelling like cigs has a negative impact on social interactions.

4) Increased risk of cancer and heart disease from smoking. Doesn't matter how good life is if I don't have a life to live.

5) Many people find smoking a turn off. This is especially a concern when it comes to dating.

6) It's expensive as hell (at least where I live). Money would be so much better spent elsewhere.

7) I'll never be in peak physical and mental condition as long as I smoke. I will always be plagued by fatigue, trouble concentrating, cravings, etc. 

8) Tobacco smoke is toxic. It's like a poisonous gas. You wouldn't smoke mustard gas/zyklon B/sarin gas, would you?

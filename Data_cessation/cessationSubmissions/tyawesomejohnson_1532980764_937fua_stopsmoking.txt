Brain Fog Gone!!

Well I quit smoking roughly five weeks ago and long after the other symptoms of withdrawal like anxiety and depression passed, I was still left with horrible brain fog and just felt overall, “slow”.

Well I woke up today exactly one month and 5 days after my quit and I am proud to say my brain fog is finally gone!! To those of you struggling just know it gets easier and it takes time so do not be discouraged if after a few weeks you still don’t feel better. 

IT WILL GO AWAY! Just hold on guys and stay strong. I feel amazing to not only be rid of my brain fog and depersonalization from quitting, but to also be free of this addiction and free to love my life on my terms again! 

To anyone thinking of quitting or wanting to quit, just do it!! You will not regret it one you’re out of the withdrawal and brain fog stage and your health and happiness is always worth it! 

If I can do it, you can!!

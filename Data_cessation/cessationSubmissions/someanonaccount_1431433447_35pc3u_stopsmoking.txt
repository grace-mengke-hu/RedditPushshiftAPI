Day 1

Been lurking this sub for a while now and have to say y'all give me hope that I can finally do this for good. I've quit a few times before, sometimes easily , sometimes painfully, but I've always ended up starting again when stress got too much. I'm hoping that this sub can help me stay quit this time.  

Here's to day 1 after 29 years!

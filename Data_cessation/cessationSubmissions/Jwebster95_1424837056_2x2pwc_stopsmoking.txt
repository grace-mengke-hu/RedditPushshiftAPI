Yesterday was my first smoke free day. It all starts here!

Starting to eat right and workout as well. Now for many many more days like that! It all starts here! I've quit in the past, trying e-cigs as a substitute, but i've realized it's all about the hands. Relying on an e-cig was just as bad for me, as it was still money out of my pocket that as a UK student I don't have, and I went straight back to smoking when I was bored of the e-cig. This time it's cold turkey all the way! Wish me luck people, we can do it!

Getting through the first non-smoking weekend

Hi all!

I'm on Day 5 here and this weekend is my first smoke-free. My boyfriend smokes (although he's been supportive + great about not smoking around me). I purposely quit during the work week so I could distract myself most of the day. Now that the weekend is here, I'm worried about temptations. Any tips or advice on making it through?

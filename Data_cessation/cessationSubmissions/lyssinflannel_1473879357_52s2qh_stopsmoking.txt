Day 52.1

Hi guys, I'm on day 52.1. That's the longest I've gone without smoking since before I picked up the habit. It seems as though the last two weeks I've been looking for excuses to and reasons to smoke. I've been thinking about it far too much - seriously like it's week one again. I got into a pretty bad argument with my husbriend during week 2 of my quit in which some choice comments were made, and I resisted the urge to smoke. And yet, 25+ days later, we got into an argument this morning (that pales in comparison) and I've been clawing at my craving since 7:05 this morning. 

My attitude of being proud of myself for getting through week 1 and how much I accomplished has somehow morphed into my romanticizing smoking and how much I miss it/the nostalgia of it/enjoyment. Maybe it's the time of year...I've barely spent any time outside since I quit, and I love the outdoors. Even doing something as minor as reading a book on my back porch. Fall is my favorite time of year and I think I may still associate those feelings with smoking. Or, I'm being a degenerate and allowing every single thing to get under my skin. 

Whoever said cravings only last 3 minutes is a goddamn idiot, first off. Secondly, not sure why I'm posting this. Just needed an outlet. 

Thanks guys. Keep on keepin' on.

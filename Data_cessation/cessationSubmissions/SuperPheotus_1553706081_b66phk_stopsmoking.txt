Last cigarette was last night

ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªjust flexin on y'all a bit. I've been something like 12 hours smoke free. 

Sucked this morning in so I started Carr's book. Wish me luck! I've tried to quit like three times this year. Turned thirty in December and it's a year of change. I'm tired of running out of breath, having stinky breath, and not being able to sing.

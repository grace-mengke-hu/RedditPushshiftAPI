3rd day on Champix feeling wierd.

Evening all,

I'm 26 and I've been smoking for 8 years, last 2 years it's been 15/20 a day. Started Champix 3 days ago and it's very strange. My dose doubled today I'm incredibly lathargic and when I get into bed my mind goes into fucking overdrive. I can see and feel things that I know are not there. Any others that can share their stories? I'm not scared yet as I've done alot of acid in the past but the dose goes up again on Sunday. Does it get easier? I have been smoking less so there's some progress, albeit minimal.

Need help.

Hello. I quit on Tuesday, so this is my 5th day. It's getting very hard. I used to smoke almost 2 packs a day, a heavy smoker. 
I know that one cig will get me back, but I don't know if I can resist. 
I am a very proud individual, I don't like that someone/something can mess with my head. And that is exactly what nicotine is doing right now. 

I get no support at work, not from friends not even my family. They all say is great, but some are envious some just don't care. It hurts, but that's another topic. 

I'm alone. Help

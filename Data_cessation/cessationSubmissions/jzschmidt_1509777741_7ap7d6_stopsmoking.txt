I'm done.

After smoking for about 5 years, slowly graduating from a social/"I smoke when I drink" smoker to a half a pack a day smoker, I'm done. 

I'm done with wasting time having cigarette breaks, smelling like an ash tray, stressing about my breath, spending money on cigarettes which I could spend on something more meaningful, feeling guilty about smoking and stressing about how it's damaging my teeth and my skin. 

I've tried to quit a couple of times before but I'm using patches and gum to curb the cravings. I'm done for good and I can't wait till the time in my life where smoking and thinking about it is a vague memory. Bring it on!

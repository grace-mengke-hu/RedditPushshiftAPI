For all of us who have made it past the initial struggle, please read this. We need to stay vigilant, we need to keep fighting.

I've read this on a wonderful website, *www.whyquit.com*, and thought I'd share it with you. It's sobering, a bit tough, but it's the truth. I recommend reading the [whole article](https://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_04_16_just_one_puff.html). Note: Italics mine.

&gt; The consequence of not becoming fanatical against a puff is too serious to just dismiss. It will be the loss of your quit, and that can easily translate into loss of your health and eventually loss of your life. You have to be vigilant at all times, to keep reminding yourself that ***you are a recovering addict.***

&gt; Over time there may be no signs of the addiction; thoughts of cigarettes may have become rare events now and maybe even non-existent. But even at this stage of the game, there is a silent addiction still there that can take you down with full force for making one miscalculation -- ***thinking that maybe you are different.***

&gt; ***You are no different than any other drug addict***, whether the drug was alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc. You are an addict for life, but as long as you get the drug out of your system and never administer it again, you will never be set into the downward spiral that the drug sets into motion to its users. In regards to smoking, that spiral is loss of your freedom, your health and your life, which means you can lose everything.

&gt; To keep what you've got, always remember that to stay smoke free you must **NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF!**

Looking forward to enjoying the taste of cigarettes again.

I'm always amazed by how my brain relentlessly comes up with schemes to start smoking again.

I remember the last time I stopped smoking and restarted again: I had meticulously planned when I was going to start again. When the day came along, I had that first cigarette and as you might expect, it was disgusting and it even made me feel a little ill. However, I had decided that I'd fallen off the wagon of non-smoking and I was going to smoke again. All I had to do was get used to the taste again and I'd be ok.

It's ridiculous. I'm almost already accepting defeat in my battle against smoking. I'm expecting that one day, probably within a month or two, I'm going to start again. I know it's going to taste disgusting but I'll smoke on through the horribleness until I feel like smoking isn't disgusting.

Even now, my brain is telling me that although it'll be disgusting, I'll not enjoy those first few (and enjoy very few others subsequently), all I need to do is keep on smoking and I'll soon be convincing myself I'll enjoy it again.

Why does my brain toy with me so? I love not smoking, I never have any of the crazy cravings people talk about... I just can't imagine ever entirely ridding my brain of the desire to smoke.

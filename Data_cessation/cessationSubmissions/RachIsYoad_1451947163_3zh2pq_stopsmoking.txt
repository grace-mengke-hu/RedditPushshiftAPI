My scheduled quit day is in 2 days...

But there's only one smoke left in my pack. I'm thinking I shouldn't even buy another pack and instead let the last one I have today be the last one period. I've downloaded the quit smoking app, I've downloaded my fitness pal to watch what I eat so I don't substitute with snacking, and I've read what a lot of you had to say here. I think I am ready... Just pray that I'm not too awful on my family...

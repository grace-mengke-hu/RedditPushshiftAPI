I just smoked my last cigarette!

I know a lot of you are probably still asleep.  
But I set today 9am (here in the netherlands) as my quitday/time.
I just smoked my last one.
It's gonna be hard, I've smoked more than a pack a day for 10 years. And to top it of my wallet was stolen yesterday.  
But I'm gonna do this! I do it for my mom, to show her that you can definitely quit if you really want to.   'Cause apparently getting lung cancer twice (which resulted in removing almost her whole left lung) wasn't enough reason to quit.. 
And ofcourse for myself because I don't want to end up as my mom.  
Hopefully this sub will support me somewhat since no one thinks I can do it..  
Bye everyone have a great day! ðŸ˜Š

Fighting cravings

In half an hour I will have 25 days without a puff. 5 days I believe into being nicotine free. That has been a little tough. I've had more cravings than I thought I would. I guess I was hoping that right at that 72 hour mark, an alarm would set and balloons would fall from the sky like, "YOU MADE IT! EVERYTHING WILL BE RAINBOWS AND SUNSHINE FROM NOW ON!"

Well, needless to say, that didn't happen. 

But I AM grateful to be smoke free. Grateful for my sobriety from nicotine. Grateful to have killed the little monster and now I gotta just keep fighting. My SO smokes and he left a pack here tonight. I took it out to the dumpster because I could feel those cravings coming on and I didn't want to fight with them. I wanted to show them that I have won. Bring it on. Show me the best you've got. I got this.

8hrs without a cigarette after a 7 month relapse.

I was smoke free for a year and a half until last fall. While on vacation last summer visiting some old friends in my hometown, I found myself in posession of a friends' pack of cigarettes while he was at a family bbq. I was with some other friends at the time and thought to myself, what's the harm in one smoke with my old buddies?

Well I ended up smoking most of his pack that night and had a few more on the rest of my visit before having one last cigarette before my flight back home at the end of my vacation, and that was that right? the whole smoking thing was just part of a vacation, an escape from my daily life. 

Which was fine, for a while but within a couple of months I found myself bumming a couple of smokes from a coworker and inevitably walking over to the gas station to buy a pack. I went on smoking once more for 7 months, back in the grip of my vice which was so easy to slip into once more.

As of this post, it's been 8 hours since I last had a cigarette and soon it will be 8 days, then 8 weeks and 8 months since my last cigarette. I just want to say to everyone here, no matter how long you go without smoking, you can never let your guard down. And no matter how many times you have quit in the past, it's never too late to take control.

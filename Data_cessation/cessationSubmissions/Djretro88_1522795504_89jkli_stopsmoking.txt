Day 4 cold turkey - Hyper active and annoying myself!

Hi, I posted a few days ago about being on patches and I was using far too many so I decided to go cold turkey and for the first ever time after trying for many years I am now about to start day 5.

I quit cigarettes about 3 years ago and switched to vaping never adjusted my nicotine levels in the juice and was just as addicted.

I haven't really had a hard time quitting, except for the dizziness that I had for the first 3 days which has now gone and the fact that i am hyper active, I ramble, constantly wanting to be moving and im exhausted, my eyes also sting. Does anyone know how long this lasts?

I won't smoke/vape/use but it would be nice to have a milestone for when I can expect this awful hyper feeling to go. Thanks

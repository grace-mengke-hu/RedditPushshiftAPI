I started..

Oke, so ever since I was 13 I smoked either pot or cigarettes, (weirdly enough never both), quit pot when I was 18, stopped smoking at 22, now 7 years later I started smoking cigarettes again for no good reason other than thinking oh well, once at a party, who cares, and slowly it crawled back in my system. Last weekend I smoked half a pack and during the past few days I didn't but just now I smoked one again. I don't know why. I figured I sort of earned it or something ( rough month, hard week, bad day). This weekend will be a big party again. I need to be able not to do this. I need to stop again. I don't want to be the smelly guy. I don't want to be the guy that has to step into a doctor's office one day and has to hear the worst sentence in his life. I don't want any of it. Why the fuck am I so stupid. 

I need help. I need tricks. But most of all I need a fucking spine.

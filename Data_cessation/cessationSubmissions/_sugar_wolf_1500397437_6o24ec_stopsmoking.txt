sober person quitting my only "vice"

Hey everyone! came across this forum through an app I'm using.

Been an on off smoker since my teens and I'm now 25 and ready to kick this addiction for real.
Since I've been sober from alcohol and drugs for 3 years now I've had a very difficult time letting go off this remaining bad habit. It's like a safety friend at parties being the only sober person. It's the edge..(I know that's total bullshit)
Maybe it's just simpler to say that I'm ridiculously addicted to nicotine.
Here's to day 4 smoke free!

Reading the posts here helps
thanks

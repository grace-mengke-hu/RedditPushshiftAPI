So far I've gained 73 hours of life

I know people say that each cigarette you smoke cuts 7 minutes of your life and since I've quit I've downloaded this app that breaks everything down for you and apparently I've gained 73 hours back. What a scary feeling. 
I didn't even smoke much, maybe 7 to 9 cigarettes a day since I was 18. I'm now 24.. so 6 years of my life I've smoked cigarettes. 
I've quit cold turkey because about 2 weeks ago I had severe bronchitis and I had extreme hurting pressure on my chest that scared me. I haven't had any severe withdrawal symptoms, just slight mood swings and crazy surreal dreams. And I guess it does help that my husband hates the smell of smoke. 
I wish you all the best of luck on your path to becoming healthier individuals. Please remember that you only have one life and it's not worth your time to spend the money you've worked so hard for to put something in your body that will slowly but eventually kill you! Life is short and precious. <3

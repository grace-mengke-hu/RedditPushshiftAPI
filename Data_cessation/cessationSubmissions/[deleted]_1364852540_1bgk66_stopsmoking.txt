Trying to help a coworker quit.

My coworker just found out that she's pregnant and is having a very difficult time quitting. I'm trying to be supportive and help her come up with ideas on how to make it as easy as possible.

(As a former smoker, I know the process can rarely be described as "easy".)

I'm going to bring her a basket of goodies tomorrow: toothpicks, sugar free gum, mints, coffee stir sticks, and whatever else I can find at Walgreens.

Do you have suggestions on what else I can include? Anything else that worked for you? Writing lists, picking up a specific hobby, etc.

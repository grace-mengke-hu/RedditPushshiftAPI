12 days, I think. The only indoor room where I'd smoke was my bedroom, and so far the best part I noticed is that now...

MY CAT IS ALWAYS IN MY BEDROOM.

I guess the smell isn't gone, I haven't really given my room the cleaning it needs to be rid of it. But with no more smoke in the air, my cat's always just snoozing on my bed (of course always on the black hoodie that I leave on there) or snoozing on top of a dresser that I'm not sure how she gets on top of.

It also smells a lot nicer in here, and in the whole 2nd floor of my house.

I'd like to say that if I went back to smoking, I wouldn't smoke inside, but I know I would. I've had enough with other forms of drug addiction to say that I sort of know how it works.

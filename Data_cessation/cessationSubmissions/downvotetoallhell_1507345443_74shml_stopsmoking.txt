tips for a new quitter?

I've quite before years ago using a vape pen and it worked out great for a while, but I started smoking again eventually. I want to quit for good this time. I can't find any stickied posts on tips but the things im concerned about are:

how do I abstain from smoking especially in the presence of other smokers? what are some things you guys tell yourselves to stay away?

do people around here vape, cold turkey, or ??? I know my journeys going to be different but I'm trying to get a lay of the land around here as I dont regularly post anywhere and I think this subreddit could be a good support group for me

any tips appreciated!

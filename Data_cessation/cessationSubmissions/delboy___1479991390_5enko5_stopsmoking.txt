How to make stopping that bit easier

I saw something the other day and it gave an interesting concept. If I told you not to think of a pink elephant what is the first thing you think about? If you tell a kid not to do something, what do they do? This is because your sub conscious mind can't process negative thoughts... So when you tell yourself not to smoke, your brain makes you want to do it! So hence the craving. So substitute this with something along the lines of "today, I will only inhale air" or "today am I going to enjoy breathing pure air" etc Give it a try! Link here! https://youtu.be/gnSEbLX94Tk

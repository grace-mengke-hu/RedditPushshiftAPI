Relapsed last June, starting again tomorrow.

I stopped smoking for a year and a bit until last summer, quite the fuck up, and went back to 20 a day. Those sneaky sneaky cigarettes.  I didn't really look here then or remove my badge (been requested) at that time. It would have been 783 days of not according to my badge if I didn't relapse! The good news is that I have developed man flu today, and don't really want to smoke until I get better. Which is a nice head start, I give it a three days of being ill.  
I've got an e-cig, but it never really helped even with nicotine juice in it. So I've bought loads of poultry, it's in the oven. I feel so guilty switching to eating loads, but I really feel that the cold turkey method is best.

Anyone been through the Smoking Cessation program at CVS's Minuteclinic? What medications can they prescribe?

Heavy chain smoker here, debating quitting or at least toning down my habit. I noticed the CVS by my house offers a smoking cessation program in their MinuteClinic; I was wondering if anyone could tell me if they were would be a reputable place to go. I've been interested in trying Zyban, as the side effects of Chantrix sound terrifying, but I'm unsure what they'd actually be able to prescribe there.

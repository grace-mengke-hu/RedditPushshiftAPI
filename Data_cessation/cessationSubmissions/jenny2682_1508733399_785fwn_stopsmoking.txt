22 days in. When does the fatigue let up?

Greetings all! I was a 2 pack a day (and also used lozenges) so was basically pumping nicotine in me 24/7. I am still somewhat using lozenges but I am exhausted all the time. I am also getting over bronchitis so that could also be affecting me but I feel like a zombie!

555 DAYS!

I just decided to pop in and see what my day count was.  What a cool surprise to see 555! Just want to report that it gets easy, in fact it gets so easy after awhile that you stop thinking about it for days on end.  I remember those first few days and weeks.  Stay strong everyone.  As the days pass, as you put more and more days between you and your last smoke, you will find it gets easier. Good luck and best wishes. You can do this!

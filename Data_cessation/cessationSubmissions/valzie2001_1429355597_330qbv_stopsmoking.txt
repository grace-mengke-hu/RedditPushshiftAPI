Day 4 of NO smokes!

Welp Day 4 of no smokes starting. I slept a bit better last night then the first 3 nights. Funny I don't crave any smokes over night,  never smoked over night before, but my dreams are so messed up and so vivid and I remember most of them, probably because I'm not in a deep sleep. This morning the cravings were much less then the previous mornings, and I am loving the fact that breathing is so much easier and not stressed. I can do this,  I so want this!!! I just want to stay strong so I can do this!!!!

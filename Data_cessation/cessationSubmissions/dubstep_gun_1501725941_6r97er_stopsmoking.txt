suggestions on quittting

hey all!  So cool this is a community on here, hoping to join the ranks here soon, I desperately need to quit smoking!  I'm taking some time here to go through whatever resources are posted here so will post back with what I find.

What brought me here initially is habit replacement therapy (Charles Duhigg // power of habit).  I've sort of realized that I don't exactly have any triggers for smoking, I just sort of do it all the time, so more than anything time is my trigger, if I've not smoked in like an hour or so I just start searching for how/when I'm going to get my next cigarette.  Not sure if anyone else has experienced something similar, but suggestions are super welcome.

Thanks dudes!

Going back to college after a healthy summer at my parents'. Might relapse. Tips?

Hey guys,

I'm a 20 yr old college student and I have really huge problem. I have fallen into the trap of linking smoking to certain places or activities. When I am in my hometown with my parents I don't smoke. I spent the last 3 months working out and getting in really good shape, and I'm planning on continuing to do so during the upcoming semester.

However, the moment I set my feet at the train station in the city where I go to college, I get an urge to buy a pack. I went back to that city after a month of quitting (just for 2 days), and my urge got the best of me. I took 5-6 drags of a cig and threw it out because I was so disgusted by the taste, and the headaches solidified my stance on staying healthy. But later that night I got drunk and smoked. I immediately went back to quitting after I went back home. 

A few days from now, I'll be moving back there for college, and I don't think I have it in me. It's like wired in my brain and I can't resist for longer than a few hours. How do I disassociate smoking from my presence in that city? It's like even worse than people who get the urge to smoke in bars. My urge is linked to a whole piece of a country.

Here it FRIGGIN' goes!

Hey there r/stopsmoking!

I heard around Reddit this was the place to go to finally kick the habit. I'm SO FRIGGING ready to quit, so I bought the pro version of the app that I see all around here and set up my date for New Year's Eve. My girlfriend strongly dislikes the smell and taste on my lips of smoke, and I'm sick to death of tasting it myself with every. single. one. 

I always feel like I'm doing nothing but feeding my addiction with my bank account every day, and in the past few years I've managed to get myself down to 1-3 a day. I originally had plans to quit a little slower, but I'm so confident I can go cold turkey that I'm just gonna suck it up and do it. I'm planning on letting my family who doesn't know I smoke know that I quit when I hit a good enough milestone, I don't think any of them stalk my account here.

Not particularly looking for any support as I definitely have plenty of friends and my recently stronger willpower to help me, but writing it publicly on my Reddit account helps cement it a little more in reality. Any tips or advice about how to enjoy my last few days of smoking would be welcome, here it GOES!

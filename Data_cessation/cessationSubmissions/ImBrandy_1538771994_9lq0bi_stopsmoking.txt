3 months! When does the missing “something” go away.

I’ve been smoke free for over 3 months 🏆  
It wasn’t that hard to quit and it’s been relatively easy to stay quit -for me. But I wanted to ask/ when does the “something is missing” feeling go away? I don’t want a cigarette but several times a week I feel like “I want “something” what is it?” oh yeah cigarettes- I don’t do that anymore. 

You all are amazing. Keep going. Stay smoke free!!

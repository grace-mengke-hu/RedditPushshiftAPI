Nearly 3 weeks: it got easy, then really hard again ..

Basically the first week was absolute HELL, but after a while I started feeling healthier, I stopped liking the smell of them, and I just rode the euphoria wave for a bit. But this week my anxiety has been really bad, all my housemates moved out so I'm all on my own, and I've had a job interview- please help me get through this stress without turning back to cigarettes for support!

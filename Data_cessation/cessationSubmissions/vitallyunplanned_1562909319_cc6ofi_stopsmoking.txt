Nearly 2 years of the cigs, relapse crept up on me.

Quit ciggies with the help of a vape in Sept 2017, worked really well. Kept on the vape. Started a new job in March, had thr occasional cig with new colleagues, then went to Glastonbury and bought loads of fags and kinda just smoked since then. Obvious mistake. Is it best to go back to the vape or just cut it all out? Vape worked a miracle last time.

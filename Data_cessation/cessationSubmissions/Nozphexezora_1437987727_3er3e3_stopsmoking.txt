New Smoker - Want to Quit While I'm Ahead

I finally managed to quit a serious opiate addiction at the start of this year, after so much struggle.It's been 6 1/2 months without drugs or alcohol, and I still get cravings but it's mostly negligible. Anyway, while I quit I started smoking regularly, and I've been stuck on 5 smokes a day for the past 6 months.

I really don't know much about quitting nicotine. What should I expect from quitting, if anything at 5/day? I don't really plan on using e-cigs or patches or anything like that, because I figure they only delay a problem that can be arrested now. 

Thanks for reading.

Prisoner for 7 years | Now 7 days smoke free

Turned 24 this December. Didn't go cold turkey, as I did try quitting it many times before finally kicking the butt on the 31 December, yes I did not smoke a cigarette on new years eve and yeah not even a puff from the last cigarette before new year. (I still feel bad about it, not smoking my official last cigarette before new year)

Lately, facing mood swings, one moment I'm all happy and smiling and other minute something triggers my rage. I've started exercising, I walk and run in evening for 40 minutes now which helps me go to bed early than before.

I started smoking when I was 18 and from then on I smoked anywhere between 5 to 10 sticks a day and more when I had few drinks and did never indulge in any physical activity of that related with sports. Those cancer sticks did help me out then for keeping me calm and boosting up my confidence is what I think and so when I got addicted I couldn't do much without having a smoke first and my whole schedule was according to my cravings which did impact my life.

With years, concentration issues did come to my notice, short breath, etc and so I did decide to quit this habit, and yes I did fail many a times.

How was I able to quit this time?
My entire schedule has changed as I've relocated to a new city with my family, I got no much friends around here who smoke, this definitely keeps me away from the sticks. And willpower to lead a better life than before.

I hope I be able to succeed this time like my other fellow quitters here.
Your posts and stories are a motivation to stick to my goals.
And I pray the same that you be able to stay from cigarettes and achieve your goals.

I'll like to end this with a quote,

"It all begins and ends in your mind.

What you give power to, 

has power over you, if you allow it."

More power to you! Peace!

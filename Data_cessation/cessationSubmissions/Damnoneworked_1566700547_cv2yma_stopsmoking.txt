Do you guys sweat profusely when quitting?

Honestly I can get past the irritability, anxiety, mind fog, but I can't go about my normal day sweating this much and I hate getting dressed and immediately soaking though my clothes. If I smoke I stop sweating in about 5 minutes so I know that it's caused by my quitting. It all snowballs too because even if I'm managing my other symptoms as soon as I start sweating a ton I smoke because I can't handle being wet and cold.

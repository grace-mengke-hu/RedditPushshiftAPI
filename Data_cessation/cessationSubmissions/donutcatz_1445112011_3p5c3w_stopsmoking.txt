Advice needed: encouraging a 14 y/o boy to quit

My landlord's 14 year old grandkid recently moved in with them for high school. He's a great kid, does sports stays out of trouble. Recently with the transfer he met some new friends and took up smoking cigarettes for a few months now. 
A month ago I was in his room fixing the router for him and found he was vaping, I warned him of the dangers about the quality control on e-liquids and he seemed to understand and stopped vaping. More recently he's been using the hookah with his friends in our garage (used to be once a week but now its getting to be a 3-5 times a week thing). I'm sure he's not smoking marijuana/shatter/dabbing though because I know the smell like the back of my hand. 

His parents don't know as they're away on business most of the year. His grandparents came to me last night for advice as I am an ex smoker (I quit long before started renting from them). My situation was different I started in college and quit at 25 all on my own decision. I didn't have the social rewards/peer pressure to deal with. 

There's a lot of misinformation in these kids' heads, they think that the hookah's water cooling process removes the toxins/nicotine from cigarettes. 

I don't know how to start the conversation and neither do the grandparents.

Day 10. Simultaneously the best and worst decision ever.

I quit for the first time ten days ago. I have been smoking for 13 years and I'm 27 years old. There is something really gross to me about the fact that I have been smoking for over half my life. I am doing everything to stop. I have a vape pen which I rarely use. It's 12 mg. I have nicotine gum. I have these terrible herbal cigarettes that taste like garbage that I smoke whenever I feel like I'm about to murder something. I also have a nice herbal blend that I smoke that has passionflower and other sleepy slightly sedative herbs that relaxes me at night. This is working for me. 
Also funny story I had a half a pack of cigarettes that I was keeping in my purse. Not to smoke but just to have kind of like a safety net. And then the other night I was looking for something in my purse, and I couldn't find them. I freaked the fuck out. I became super irrationally angry and thought that somebody had stolen my cigarettes to keep me from smoking. I was crazy paranoid. And then I realized I put them in my glove compartment the next morning. It's beenâ€¦ Hard. Ha ha ha ha.

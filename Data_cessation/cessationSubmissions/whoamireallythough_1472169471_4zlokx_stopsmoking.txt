Blood Pressure has gone down!!

I got my blood pressure read for the first time since I quit smoking a pack a day (still having one every morning when I get to work- hoping to change that soon), & my readings went from prehypertensive to normal!! 

It feels like a small victory, but it kind of motivates me to really, truly quit!

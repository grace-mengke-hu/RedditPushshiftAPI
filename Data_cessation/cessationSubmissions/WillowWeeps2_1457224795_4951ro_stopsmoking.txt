Starting over

I just put out my last cigarette. I am going to do it this time. I have too much on the line. I just got done with having pneumonia. I have a breathing test on Wednesday. I quit 3 weeks ago, but I cheated by having a cigarette here and there. Now I have to do it for real. I'll be reading through this subreddit to keep me motivated!

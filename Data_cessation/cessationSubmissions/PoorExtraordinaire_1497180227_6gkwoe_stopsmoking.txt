First cigarette was when I was a child. Not sure what age. *Just Quit*

So, I have a memory as a young boy, I think maybe I was 6 or so, I went into my mom's pack and grabbed a cigarette and a lighter and sparked one up.

Started smoking at around age 10. Smoked until 12. Then started up at age 14. Smoked until 18. And then somewhere I started again in my early twenties. I am 30 now.

Been a pack a day smoker.

I quit using an e-cigarette last year on July 5th. I got down to 2mg on my e-cig liquid. But recently had some stressful days and broke. Yes, I foolishly bought a pack 3 days ago, had 2 the first day, then 3 and 3. I just finished my last one. I ripped up my remaining cigarettes into bits and disposed of them.

I do have what doctors have considered a severe Bipolar I diagnoses, so that's why I haven't gone cold turkey until now. I rarely go into a manic episode but I am still worried because when I have experienced them in the past, they are terrible.

I am always on my medication, see a doctor every 3 months, and so forth.

But, I am SICK of nicotine. Just this addiction having such control over me. I feel weak everytime I reach for my e-cig or a losenge or something. So I want to white knuckle it and get it over with.

Any tips for when the cravings start to pour in and I get overwhelmed? Any catchy profound Mantras?

I'm going to write down all of the reasons I want to quit. So I can read them everytime I'm about to snap.

Any tips on the rage also?

I'm in between jobs for 3 weeks or so, so I have time to quit without the stress of work.

So, Day 1 begins now, June 11th, 4:00 AM PST.

Wish me luck!

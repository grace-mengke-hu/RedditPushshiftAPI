Day 5 for my husband HELP us both puh-lease

Hey guys, you were so amazingly helpful when I posted on Monday abt my husband quitting. It has not been an easy 5 days, mostly for him of course! He’s hanging in there, but it is getting tough. His personality will go back to normal in a few weeks, right? He started smoking at age 18 so now, he’s smoked longer than he ever didn’t smoke. I expected grumpiness depression, etc, but it almost seems that his whole personality has changed. I keep telling him it’s temporary. Is it? He says he doesn’t know who he is without smoking so he doesn’t know if there’s “going back to normal.” But he’s been acting pretty different. Any encouraging words are greatly appreciated!

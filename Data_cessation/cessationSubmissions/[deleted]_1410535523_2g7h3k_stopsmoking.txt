Confused about nicotine patch strength: it says "contains 114 mg, releases 21 mg over 24 hours". What gives?

The nicotine patch I just got - "NiQuitin Clear 21 mg/24 hours" - says that it contains 114 mg per patch but only releases 21 mg over 24 hours, without offering any explanation.

Would appreciate if someone could explain what this means. Why all the extra nicotine?

I miss smoking, im sure I have gone past most of the stages and yeah sure i feel better in the morning when I dont have a cig on a night out, but fuck

I just miss it you know. the bond you get with all the other smokers. you know what I mean. I just miss chatting to folk about it and what have you. I know i'm better off without it but fuck i miss smoking every now and again. 

especially when im drunk and yes im drunk now.

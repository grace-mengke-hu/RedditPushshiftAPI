Faced my first real challenge, and overcame it!

So I'm about 19 hours into my second day as a non-smoker, and I think I'm doing pretty good. My best friend/roommate and I decided to quit together to help support each other, but she just caved and bought a pack.

She got back with them and stepped out on our porch to smoke, and I did briefly have that thought that maybe just one cigarette would be okay. But I know it's not, so I stayed inside and looked at my smoke free app and then I came here. I'm confident in my decision, and I'm pretty proud of my little victory!

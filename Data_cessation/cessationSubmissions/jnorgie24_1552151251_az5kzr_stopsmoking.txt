Starting Today!

Hey everyone, I’ve been smoking for about a month total and decided I️ should quit for a while then see what happens.  My goal is to go smoke free from today until April 11th 2019. While I️t is a small goal I️ have to start somewhere.  I heard the first 3 Days after quitting are the hardest. Are there any tips/tricks that I️ should use to avoid a relapse?

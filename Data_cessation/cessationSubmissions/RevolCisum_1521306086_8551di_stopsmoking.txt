Day 13 and so short of breath

Having trouble catching my breath today and having dizzy spells, not sure why.  I haven't slept well the past couple of days.  Trying to eat regularly, but not really keeping that up either, bc of nausea.  Having tons of a allergy symptoms, including reactions to my allergy injections.  And of course, anxiety is ever present.  I'm freaking out a bit today bc of all the physical symptoms.  

I won't smoke,  I'm not worried about relapse.  I have nicotine lozenges if it feels unmanageable.  I'm just trying to work and am struggling bc I feel like I can't breathe.   Lots of yawning and belching, feeling like I'm trying to get air.  Ugh.

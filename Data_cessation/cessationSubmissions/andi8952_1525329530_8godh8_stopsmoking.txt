Try to quit possible for the 10th time...

Yea title says it all, I give it another shot tomorrow morning. 

I smoked like 4 cigs this morning because my train was 20 minutes late and I had to wait at the station. Then in front of my office 2 more. 

Now my voice is cracking all the time and my colleagues are mocking me... hahaha *in a very high pitched voice*

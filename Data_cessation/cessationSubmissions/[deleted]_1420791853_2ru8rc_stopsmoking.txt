Quit Smoking, Still Coughing

Hey there r/stopsmoking,

I was a smoker of 6 or 7 years, I quit nearly 5 weeks ago today. I was just wondering if anyone knows when I'll stop coughing? It's usually alright until night when I head to sleep, and suddenly start constantly coughing in bed. 

This should go away soon, yeah?

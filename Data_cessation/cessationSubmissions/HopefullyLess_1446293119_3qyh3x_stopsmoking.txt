I dreamed again, it's a really weird feeling

I dreamed I was with a buddy, and he offered me a cigarette. I was like "well, fuck it. I take one, don't care." 

A few minutes after I woke up, I got this vague and curious feeling that I fucked up, and when I remembered the dream, I was confronted with "my" decision. 

I'm convinced that I would have said no in reality, what is it that makes us smoke in our dreams? Is it because we are reliving memories in first-person?

 I can't help but smile at my confusion about this, just like the last time. "Was that me? Did I do that? Oh wait, it was just in my head."

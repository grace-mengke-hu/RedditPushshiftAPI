10 years of smoking. Third and (hopefully) final try. Posting this because I want something/someone to hold me accountable.

I was actually successful the first time I tried to quit 3 odd years ago. 

Lasted for around three months without cigarettes. Started again simply because I knew no other way to relieve stress and for the first couple of days was absolutely disgusted by the smell and taste of cigarettes yet persisted (what was I thinking???) and was smoking around 2/3rds of a pack a day again in a few days...

No more of this. Not willing to sacrifice my health for something that at best helps me escape the things I need to deal with. 

I'm not nearly healthy enough as I am to waste whatever I've got left on this bullshit.

On a side note, the last time I quit I only lasted 5 days because I became very irritable, which people around me visibly did not like and I myself did not enjoy. 

I know that by this time the physical aspect of your addiction is supposed to play no role, but I kept getting these agonising headaches that vanished once I started smoking again. In case something similar happens this time, what's the best course of action?

Thanks in advance for all the advice and wish me luck.

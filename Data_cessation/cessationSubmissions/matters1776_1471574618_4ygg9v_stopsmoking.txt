New YouTube series, "the School of Wisdom", a resource for Awakening the deeper dormant Powers that lie unawakened in each of us.... that allow us to self-actualize in the areas of our lives that truly matter... p.s I am an ex-smoker....

I believe quitting smoking is an extension of self-realization. It means going deep into yourself and extinguishing the powers which are enslaving you. Often times, these powers regard our connection with things that pull us into a vortex of darkness. As we shed the layers of negativity which enmesh in a life of unhealthiness we open up a new portal of experience, one of mindful self-awareness, the ability to take action in the areas of our life which truly matter. 

Personally, I used to engage in smoking and drinking for years and years. I smoked a pack a day for over five years. I drank toxic amounts. Proudly, I can say that i have disconnected from all the sources which brought my life into a state of disarray.

Coming into the light, I realize one profound thing. We must move ourselves, consciously, away from negative things, because those things absorb our powers to change and quit our bad habits.

I want to share with you the ideas that have awakened me to a new reality, a path of purity. I started up a Youtube series and a website which outlines how I was able to elevate my life to a new magnitude of richness and positive meaning. 

My youtube series is called "The School of Wisdom". It features a selection of short videos which examine several transformative concepts which greatly added to the value of my experience. 

If you are serious about quitting smoking, you need to not only focus on your habit of smoking, you need to look at your life holistically, to ensure that you quit all bad habits which are devaluing your personal power. 

Here is my website, that features over 60 pages of quality content, filled with examples and metaphors, of how i took my life to the next level.

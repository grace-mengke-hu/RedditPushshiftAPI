Two if the longest days of my life..

Every little thing has been driving me insane. I want to murder every annoyance around me. 

I started the Chantix two days ago and have been having the best/worse dreams ever.

I understand the end result; better health, longevity, and to have a decent lungs (in due time) again. However, it just seems easier to give in.

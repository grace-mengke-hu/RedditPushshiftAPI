Two milestones today. Keep up the good work, everyone!

Today is my 40th birthday, but more importantly, this:

Since 13 December 2011: 
731 days smoke free,
18278 cigarettes down,
$7311.20 and 76 days, 03:48:00 saved!

Two years, guys. I started smoking when I was 13, and smoked for 25 years. Listen, if you're feeling discouraged, it's normal, but please push through your cravings. NOT ONE PERSON around me had my back...they all wanted me to quit but NOT ONE PERSON believed I would actually be able to do it and successfully STAY quit for longer than a short period. Well, have I mentioned it's been TWO YEARS? Out of all the things I've accomplished in my life, this is in my top 5 of things I'm most proud of. Y'all can do it, too. Believe in yourselves, first and foremost!

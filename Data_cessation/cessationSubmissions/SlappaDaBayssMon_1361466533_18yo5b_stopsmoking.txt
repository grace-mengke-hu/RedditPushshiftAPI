Do do you get past those first mornings?

Everytime I quit, I always end up screwing up the next time I wake up. I've got all those sleepy-brain cob webs in my head, and I can't think straight, I always end up smoking a cigarette without even realizing it, or, the "craving" just gets to be too much for me in the early AM. Help?

Also, Day 1 again. Read Carr's book 3 times, going to listening to the audiobook again at work today. Another slick little phrase I picked up recently that I'm hoping will come to me when I need it "There's always something better to do than smoke."

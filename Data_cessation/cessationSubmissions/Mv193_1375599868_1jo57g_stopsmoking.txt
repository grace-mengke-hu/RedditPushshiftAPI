I thought I had so much

I just bummed a cig from somebody at a party. Someone who mentioned that he bought extra cause he figured people would bum. I had been sober from cigarettes for 12 days. I previously had been a pack a day smoker and was doing well with working out and not smoking and I just had a moment of weakness and smoked one. I really feel terrible about myself, so much so I made an account to post this.

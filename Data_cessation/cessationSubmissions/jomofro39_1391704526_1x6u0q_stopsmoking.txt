Quit cold turkey again, hoping for more permanent results. Made it about choice, not accessibility.

Hello,

So I quit smoking....again. I quit once cold turkey for 2 years. Not one drag for two years. Then I went back, and smoked for about 2 years. Now I am quitting again, but hoping to make it my whole life this time. I decided that I needed to make it about it being my CHOICE to quit, so I bought a pack. And I keep it. But it has not been opened for 7 days, and I feel a lot better about my choice to not open the pack. Kind of weird, but I like it. This way, I COULD have a cigarette whenever I want, but I am CHOOSING not to have any. I feel it gives me more power over it, and so far so good.

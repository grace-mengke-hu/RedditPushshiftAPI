63 Days, today seems the biggest fightü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Been 63 days, non smoker. Apparently I still get some serious cravings, today seems worst but gotta fight.
Anyone with cravings after two months and how do you deal with it?

I had subscribed to smoke free app on iPhone but changed to android and it's not available. Any good app recommendation on play store?

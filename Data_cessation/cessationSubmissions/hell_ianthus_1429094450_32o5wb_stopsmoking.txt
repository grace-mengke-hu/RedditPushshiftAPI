This shinny thing appeared this morning.

I'm keeping it and starting a collection. Being my first it will always be cherished and remember. 

My 30 day long success couldn't happen with out the the help and contribution of  wonderful ladies and gentlemen of  this fine forum, so I want to thank the Academy and everybody who stood by me in my time of need...

OK, I better have my cup of coffee before my inflated head explodes =D


thank you so much, this really is a great and supportive forum =D

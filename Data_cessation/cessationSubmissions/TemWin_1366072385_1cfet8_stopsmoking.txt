Getting into the right mindset.

This will be the third attempt at quitting smoking for me. The longest I have gone without is four days, cold turkey. After a lengthy discussion with my smoke-free partner (he has been smoke free for almost a year now), I have realized what I have been doing wrong the other times I have quit. That was quitting on a whim, instead of picking a day and spending that time to prepare and get myself into the right mindset. My day is around a week from now.

So, my question to all of you is, what is the mindset that worked for you? Did you replace it with something else? Or did you just do it and didn't look back? 

And yes, I have read Alan Carr's book and am planning on reading through it again, but it doesn't exactly go that indepth with everything about it.

TL;DR - what helped you to quit smoking and get into the right frame of mind for it?

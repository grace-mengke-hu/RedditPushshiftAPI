Last cigarette

Hey guys, while smoking a cigarette just now, i told my self "ok, I think it's time to do it". So I thought to add another reason or motivation to my desire to quit smoking. And that is to protect my integrity and never allow for my next words to turn False: 

This was my last cigarette!

By sharing this with yo, I will be in a tight spot, sorta'

I'll keep this sub  as a constant angel thay  whispers in my ears.

Good night!

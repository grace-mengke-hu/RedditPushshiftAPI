Feeling very strange today and not in a good way!

I have been allover the place today, will I smoke wont I smoke, if I'm going to smoke I may as well get it over and done with, its just not worth putting myself through this, the lack of sleep the mental feelings that come from not sleeping. I'm hot and itching feeling really uncomfortable, cant believe that giving up nicotine can be doing this.
I'm determined not to smoke, I have smoked for 37 years and its time to stop just need to bounce it out there.
I've had a couple of good days but I've been reading the posts and new I wasn't over it yet.
I haven't smoke and I wont smoke.

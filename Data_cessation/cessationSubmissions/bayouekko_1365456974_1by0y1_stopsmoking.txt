So, getting ready to try again.

I have been a smoker for seven, almost eight years (holy crap, almost a *decade*!?). I "quit" several times, my longest period being six months. I want to kick the habit for good. I want to save the money, and I want to feel better! I want to get back in the gym and be fit like I used to be. So, I am getting ready to kick the habit again. I keep saying I want to, but this time, I really **feel** like I want to. 


It's going to be difficult, because my husband is a smoker. We've talked about quitting and quitting together several times, he's tried once on his own but I don't think he's quite ready yet. Hopefully, my success in quitting will be his spark of hope that he too, can quit. It's one of my motivating factors. We want to start trying for children within the next year/year and a half, and I want to be as healthy as possible by that time. Those are my two biggest motivating factors. Any tips or suggestions?

so i have been quiting smoking this month, only smoking on weekends , down from a 50gram of rollies and a pack a week . now i only smoke weekends. today i chained smoked 12 and i feel no better.

my last acid trip i smoked like 60 cigs in 2 hours, and now i cant enjoy any you would think it would help me to quit but i still dream of my old days of sitting on the back porch jamming my ipod having a spliff and a tea, thoes days are numbered i now fear.

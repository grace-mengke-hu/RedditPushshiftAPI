Anti-triggers.

I quit right before going on vacation with my girlfriends family, who are all pack a day smokers and the ones that got me started smoking. I thought this might be a bad time to stop, but I figured if I could make it through a 4 day vacation with them, I could make it through anything. I think I was right.

Granted, I got some strong cravings when we were drinking beer and they were chain smoking outside, but more importantly I realized just how pathetic the whole habit is. Seeing them jump out of the truck at every stop, pulling the cigarette out of the pack before there feet even touched the ground, trying to get every last drag before we left again, and smoking two cigarettes to make up for the few hours they'd have to live with without a cigarette. The pathetic desperation of it all is something I never realized until I looked from the outside in.

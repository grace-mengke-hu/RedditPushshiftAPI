Hello all.

So, I've successfully quit drinking thanks to the help of SD. My next step is to quit smoking, which has increased quit a bit. About a pack every other day. I bought a vape and it helps occasionally, but I guess since I don't constantly puff on it, i don't get the same feel. I'v ebeen smoking for about 11 years and it's time to quit. Hopefully this sub will help!

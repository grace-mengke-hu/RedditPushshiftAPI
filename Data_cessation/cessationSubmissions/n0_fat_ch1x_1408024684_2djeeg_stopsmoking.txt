I screwed up!

I just got done visiting my home in california. I thought i could do it all. Stay up late, See all my friends, get crazy drunk with all my friends, go to a wedding, all this withought smoking on my 2 week. Needless to say day 14, the 4th day of being drunk(the day of the wedding) I gave in. I smoked. I feel terrible, and also sick. I almost cant breathe too. I reset my badge and it ate away at my ego a little bit. I will now not be drinking for a long time. I will get through this, and I will beat this stupid habit!

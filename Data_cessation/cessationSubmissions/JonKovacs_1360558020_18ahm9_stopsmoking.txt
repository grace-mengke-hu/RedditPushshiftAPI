I had to remove my badge today

I was four days away from three months. I was out with a friend last night and I just caved for no reason at all. 
I've always smoked the occasional cigar here and there but lately I went from a cigar every other week, to a cigar a week, to a cigar a day, to two or three a day with mini cigars in between. I noticed it was my nicotine addiction when I inhaled without thinking. I knew it had to stop. 
I've been meaning to post something on here about how I feel like I'm about to cave but I guess I was just too late. Maybe I could've gotten some sort of support. Something. I don't know. I'm just bummin' pretty hard on myself for this one. Feels bad, man.

And on the third day...

...I completely forgot to put my nicotine patch on this morning (21mg).  I only noticed 8 hours later after waking up.  The funny thing is, I'm not rushing to get one on.  The cravings persistently come and go but they don't feel as severe as the last two days.  Perhaps I should just not put a patch on and go Cold Turkey from here on.  What do you think?

3 Months and Going Strong

After about 13 years of on and off smoking I am celebrating 3 Months smoke free, cold turkey and I know I am done.  While I am proud to have quit with zero issues, I also feel guilty it took me this long to get here.  Has anyone else gone through this? With a baby on the way it gave me the motivation I needed to quit and never look back, but I can't help feel guilty for being selfish and not quitting sooner.

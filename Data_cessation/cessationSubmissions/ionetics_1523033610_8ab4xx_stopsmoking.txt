Please may I have a reminder please of why I mustn't take that puff I'm at this moment so craving?

I will go for a brisk walk to walk it off, but would appreciate being reminded in quite direct or graphic terms why I mustn't do what my id wants. Don't be kind. Bloody cup is helping, but I could do with some cognitive input too. Thank you in advance, frenz.

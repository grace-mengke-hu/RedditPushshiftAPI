I have a question

So I quit smoking for 16 days but on the 16th day I gave in and smoked 4 cigs. But I haven't smoved since. A week after I quit my pet bunny died. That toppled with my regular anxiety plus the withdrawal anxiety...I caved. Does this mean I'm starting all over or is it just a blip on the screen? Has my body went back to square one?

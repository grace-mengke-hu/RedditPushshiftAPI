Had some terribble news at the weekend, but it's made no difference on my desire to smoke.

Stop using any kind of stress or problem an excuse to smoke or to carry on smoking. My Granddad died on Saturday, but not at any one point did I even think a cig would make me feel any better. Sometimes people use things like this as "yes, perfect excuse to smoke!" I know it sounds harsh, but ultimately true! Anyway, i'm 39 days, getting easier every second! Any new QUITTERS, please keep going. Best thing you'll ever do.

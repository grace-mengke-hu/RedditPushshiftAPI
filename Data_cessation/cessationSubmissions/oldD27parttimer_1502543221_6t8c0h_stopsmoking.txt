day 33 and morning cravings are getting stronger (37 year smoker)

Well I smoked for 37 years and I smoked the heaviest in the morning. Damn it though, I feel like caving in again this morning.
I thought mornings were getting better, but the last few days have been a real bitch. 
I just don't understand why these morning cravings have gotten stronger the last few days?

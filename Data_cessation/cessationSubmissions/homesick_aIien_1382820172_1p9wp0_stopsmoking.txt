Can anyone relate?

I can go online and find countless articles about how quitting is different for everyone but it'd be nice to hear from anyone on here.. 
It's been 8 days for me. My chest feels all sticky inside and my voice is kinda messed up. My tongue is also slightly burning. 
Did anyone have this happen to them and then eventually have it go away? Not that I'm going to go back to smoking if I don't hear from anyone but misery loves company and am just looking for someone to relate to!

More than a 100 days free, and yet I still get smoking dreams.

I read the Allen Carr Book and was finally able to kick the habit. I was a pack a day smoker for almost four years (which isn't much compared to the majority of you, I know) but the book got me to quit cold turkey on what was at the very least my fifth try. 

I don't miss smoking, but every so often I get dreams wherein I light up and feel absolutely terrible as a result...only to be relieved when I wake up and find out that it was just a dream. What gives, though? Why am I still having these dreams?

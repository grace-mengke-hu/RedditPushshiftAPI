Why didn't I do this earlier?

30 days smoke free!

I had lost any hopes that I would ever be able to say such thing. I had smoked for 20+ years, a pack a day, even more on weekends or vacations. I had tried quitting several times, being 3 smoke-free weeks my all-time record! Quitting was always painful and invariably I would "give up" on making efforts, and will puff again...

I thought I would never succeed at quitting. I had all the typical fears: I would't be able to concentrate, I wouldn't be myself, I wouldn't be able to enjoy socializing or partying, my withdrawal symptoms and bad mood would destroy my personal entourage,...

30 days later I can say that all those fears where pointless and for the first time in my life I feel confident I am an ex-smoker. What was different this time? State of mind - that simple. Being convinced this was the end and that I could do it. 

And it worked! And I am the happiest I have ever been! :-) And all I can think of is why didn't I quit earlier! I can only encourage everyone to go through the process!

Got the push, now where do I find the motivation?

About 2 months ago I made a bet with my dad that if he lost 75 pounds, I'd have to run a half-marathon with him next spring. He has already lost about 25 pounds and couldn't be more motivated. I know I am going to have to run the marathon with him, but the problem is that I've been smoking since I was 17. Almost everyday I tell myself "This is going to be my last one", but it never is. Any tips?

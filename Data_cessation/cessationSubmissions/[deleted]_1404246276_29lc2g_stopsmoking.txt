Feeling very angry

I stopped smoking on 05/22/14 (so 40 days) and it's been surprisingly easy so far. Noticed yesterday that I was getting angry yesterday. I'd been sitting in the car for around 11 hours so I thought it could have been that. I've been relaxing at home today doing, for all intents and purposes, fuck all. Still I found myself having random ~3 second bursts of anger, were there should be anything. I've had things that should have made me upset or angry happen to me in the past month and I've been as mellow as I normally am. Should I be getting angry at this stage of quitting, or is there something else triggering it?

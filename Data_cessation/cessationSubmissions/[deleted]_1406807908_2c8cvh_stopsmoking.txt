Irritability is my middle name...

I'm already dealing with the irritability and frustration only a couple days in..and I'm chewing nicotine gum! I have a very long commute to work and most of the drive was okay. Driving and smoking was my favorite thing to do, but I think I'm getting over that part pretty well. However, by the time I got to the city I work in (full of awful, aggressive drivers), I was starting to feel slightly annoyed. I finally tipped when someone cut me off and missed me by inches, causing me to slam my breaks. 
  Now, usually I can mutter a few words under my breath and get over it pretty quickly, being used to asshole drivers. But this time, I lost it. I was screaming every horrible word under the sun, gripping the steering wheel with both hands, and felt my heart race. I mean, I was wild! Thankfully, that dude ran our red light and I didn't have to see his car anymore, because the last thing I need is that guy getting out of the car and whooping my ass because of my outrageous behavior.

  It's awful to see myself act like that, and I got it under control after a minute, but it scares me...I've been trying to keep my irritability in check, but today makes me worried that it's going to be harder than I originally thought...I can't wait for this awful part of quitting to be over already...

A doctor came up to my dad and said he should check out his throat as heard him coughing "weirdly".

My dad is 56 and has been smoking since he is a teenager. A friend of him who is a doctor heard him cough and told him to go check himself. He fell into a panic and fortunately it wasn't anything life threatening and no signs of cancer or anything like it. Now after that small comment and the immediate panic that befell him its been 2 years since he stopped smoking. So if any doctors are viewing this I would recommend to instill a little panic to a few people. It may not work for anyone but it surely helped for my dad.

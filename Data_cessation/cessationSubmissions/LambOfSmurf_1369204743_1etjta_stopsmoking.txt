The first week is the hardest, but if you find good alternatives...

It's been a little over a month now, and it hasn't been easy.  The biggest thing that has changed since the last 100 other times trying to quit, is I am finally quitting for myself, not for a girlfriend or any family.  My biggest advice to those stuck in that awful first week is; sunflower seeds, sweet tea, jerky chew, and constant pictures of health effects.  I scared myself shitless, I find it to be a good method.  Keep at it! The first week is the hardest, and if you really want to quit you will!

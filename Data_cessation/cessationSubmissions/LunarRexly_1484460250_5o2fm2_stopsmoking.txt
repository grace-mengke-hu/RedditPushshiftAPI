Advice for someone that wants to quit but can't get away from cigarettes?

So I (22 f) started smoking when I was 16 and I'm about to turn 23 next week. My fiancé (25 m) and I have both decided we want to quit, so why not do it together? We're each other's support system and we are determined to make this change so that we can live happy, healthy, and long lives together. Our original plan was to quit on my birthday, but when our cigarettes ran out last night (Friday) we figured why not now?

Today was supposed to be day one. Our cigarettes were gone, we had talked about it and we were ready. To set the scene, he's at home and I am going to work. Work is my problem. I work at a gas station where it is one person per shift. We are right next door to another station owned by the same company. I am constantly surrounded by cigarettes and people smoking. I have no one at my store to distract me or to keep me in check. I have begun telling my regular customers that I plan on quitting to form some kind of system where I can be held accountable, but of course none of them are there all the time. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has faced this situation and how they handled it. Any advice would be appreciated. I had a really hard time avoiding smoking today because business was slow and I didn't have a lot to do, on top of the everyday stress of dealing with the public. I made it about half way through my shift before I grabbed a pack and I ended up bringing another one home for me fiancé. 

Sorry for the rambling, I just need some advice please. 

Tl;dr: I work at a gas station and I'm surrounded by cigarettes and smokers all day. How do I get past that to quit?

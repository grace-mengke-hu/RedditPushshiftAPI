Today I stop

Today is the day I finally stop. I am tired of trying over and over again and I am tired of not getting anywhere with it. Today I am stopping this cycle and stopping this disgusting money sucking habit all together. For at least a month I will be posting daily on my thoughts and issues with this. After that it will be a post here and there. Any love or encouragement is greatly appreciated as well as advice. This is a cold turkey approach. No weening off, no pills, patches, or any sort of thing like that. I've tried many of those approaches before and just never got anywhere with them. My first official post on this subject matter will be tomorrow. For now this is an introduction of sorts. I'm also hoping that my writings will help inspire others to follow in my tracks and stop smoking as well. So for now this is the start of a new life for me. It will stick this time.

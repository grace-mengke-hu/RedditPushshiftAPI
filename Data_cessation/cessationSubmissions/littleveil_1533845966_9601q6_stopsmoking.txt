Four days, zero cigarettes~

I've been lurking on this sub for a while, now I'm proud to say I have an occasion to post!

I used to smoke a pack to a pack and a half a day and just felt disgusting. It was so comforting to know that at the end of a stressful situation, I had a cigarette waiting to take my mind off of it. Since I began taking meditation and daily affirmations seriously, the need for a cigarette has slowly decreased. Seeing posts from this sub everyday really helped prepare me for quitting, too!

Thank you guys, I'm so excited to go the rest of my life without smelling gross! ;P

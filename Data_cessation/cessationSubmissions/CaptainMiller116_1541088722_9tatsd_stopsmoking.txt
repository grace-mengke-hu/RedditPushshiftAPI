Day 2 - feeling pretty good

I've quit before, but this time feels different.   I'm done with the nonsense lies my nicotine-addicted brain has told myself over the last 20 years.  Now every time I get a craving I think hard about it and try to realize that the only real way to make it stop is to not feed it.  I'm also trying to break the conditional stimulants that make me think about smoking - the walk to work, mid morning break, after lunch, etc.  Telling myself that a cigarette won't make those activities any better, and actually worse.

I may sound like an optimistic day-two'er, but that's the attitude I'm going with.

When do the worst cravings hit - around day 3-4?

convincing my friend to stop smoking

So I'm not a smoker my self and I hate that little thing more than anything  my friend started smoking like 3 months ago and I'm trying to convince him to stop he knows how dangerous it is and how bad it gets by time but every time I  tell him why is he smoking he tells me that he just wants  something to spend on doing and smoking a cigarette is his solution is there any way  that he could do (other than sports) to distract him from this 
I want that dumbass to stop before he gets to a point of no return

Suggestion required

I been smoking for nearly five years and never admitted that i'm addicted to cigarettes as i keep it under control. I only smoke a cigarette  per day but i can't give it up. one my friend suggested reddit is good place to start. I have read many articles from cheesy websites and none of them worked for me. Can anyone suggest me some plan that could work.
Thank you

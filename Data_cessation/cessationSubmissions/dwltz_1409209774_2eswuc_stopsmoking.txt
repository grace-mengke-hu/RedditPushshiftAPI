A year today

Hey you guys, so today marks a year since I quit! Or well, in a few hours I will be a non-smoker for a year. 

Anyway, this sub an Allen Carr's book have helped me and kept me motivated when I was craving. Right now I only remind myself from time to time that I do NOT NEED smoking. That it WILL NOT add anything positive to any experience I'm having at that moment and that smoking is nothing but a smelly, unhealthy, expensive addiction.

I did this, now you do it as well. I know all of you out here can as long as you keep your head up and stay proud of yourself!

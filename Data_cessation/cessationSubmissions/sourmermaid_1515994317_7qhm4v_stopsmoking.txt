quitting + grandma’s funeral

I’m headed to stay with my extended family for a week for my grandma’s funeral and for some crazy reason..I’m feeling like this is the time to quit. I’ve been really thinking about it for a while and have been in a lot of fear about pulling the trigger. I feel incapable of quitting. I really want to though. I can feel it destroying my body and hate the money I waste and way I smell. I also hate feeling trapped in it and can’t smoke at work so I feel awful every afternoon. 

Part of the reason I’m feeling this might be the time is that I don’t want to hurt my family by smoking around them during this difficult time. My grandma smoked her whole life and they vocally did not like it. My mom is grieving right now and I know she also hates that I smoke. I don’t want to be excusing myself for a cigarette during a time when I should be focused on my family. I’ll also be away from my regular triggers and not have a car to just jump in to go buy a pack. 

I’m considering using the patch and not bringing any smokes. I also have lozenges. Is this a terrible idea? I’m feeling anxious about it already.

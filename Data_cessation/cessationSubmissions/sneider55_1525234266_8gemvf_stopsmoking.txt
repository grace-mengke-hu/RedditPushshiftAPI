Stopsmoking

My last cigarette was last Friday at 730 am. I've been using the patch and gum. It's been an almost constant battle to not smoke especially in the afternoons at work. I'm so sleepy in the afternoon that I've been taking naps on couch in my office. Hard to concentrate.  The anxiety had been almost unbearable among with the rage. Well i finally have in tonight around 10 PM and smoked. Anyone have suggestions for anxiety,  cravings and lack of concentration?

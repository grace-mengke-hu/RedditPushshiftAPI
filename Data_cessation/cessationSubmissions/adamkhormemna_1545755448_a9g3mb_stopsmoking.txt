Stopped smoking 4 days ago having a lot of cravings.

Hello guys Ive been smoking for the past 3 years I stopped smoking 2 months ago for a month but relapsed now I've been smoke free for another 4 days but I am having a really difficult time this time around. I feel like smoking and find myself finding reasons to begin smoking again. How did you guys deal with someone thing like this.

Survived first (work)week

I did not even intend to stop but I went out of cigs Sunday night and somehow forgot to buy new ones all week! It wasn't until Wednesday I realized what is happening and I was absolutely okay with it, haha!

I stopped smoking/drinking once before for a 1/4 year and I fear that once again I will relapse because of social gatherings! I kind of 'got away with it' til now because I am down south this week and do not really have social contacts here, so no temptations!

The big question for me is how can I convince my fiancee to at least consider joining me in this endeavour? She already has decided for herself that she won't stop before we start making babies  (let me rephrase: she will stop some time prior to us deciding to try having a baby)  which won't be for a couple more years. To me, it sounds like an easy way to betray yourself, because that event is stil sol far away and who knows..... sorry for incoherence, I kinda rambled on there for a bit.

Anyway, can anybody suggest some resources/information so that I may try to convince her to stop? because honestly, I can not play the ashtray-kissing-game again... that was the major factor in relapsing last time

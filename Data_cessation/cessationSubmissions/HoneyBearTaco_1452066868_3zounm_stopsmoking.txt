Sometimes I wish that this subreddit would notify subscribers of people like me who repeatedly try to quit and fail

I know it would be problematic in regards to account privacy etc., but I think it would be nice -- if you're like me -- if the badge feature would notify other users of repeated badge requests / removals.

I go 3, 4, 5 days without smoking, and then I fuck it up. 

I feel like support from other users would be a nice touch if they were notified when some user receives a badge, deletes it, requests another etc. 

But then again, I should probably just be responsible for myself and not rely on the support from others.

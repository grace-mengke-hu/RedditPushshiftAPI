12/11/2016 (or 11/12/2016 for my US compatriots)

I've saved about ten grand a year. 
Bloody hell, I eat well these days and have a savings account for the first time ever. 

Keep fighting the good fight. 

I made four serious attempts over 15 years, each time learning, and this one stuck. 

I started at 14 and quit at 39. If I can you better believe you can.

Day 2 and Question about Nicotine Patches

Hi! I am posting for the first time here. I am 24 and started smoking when I got a job in fine dining a few years ago. Everyone smoked, and my Euro family obviously smokes like chimneys, so there I was, 0.5\-1 pack per day. I recently left my fine dining job and have a great job in education, planning to get my PhD soon etc. I thought that leaving the restaurant would make me less likely to smoke, but it's been very difficult. I tried cold turkey several times in the past few months, but the brain fog made it difficult for me to do my job, as I teach math and kept forgetting how to....like....do math. I have been on Wellbutrin 100mg in the morning for the past month to help with cravings but I think the dose is too low. Will address with doc in a few days at the month\-in followup.

I decided to start with the patch, since it worked for my mother. I picked a terrible time to quit: I'm moving in a month, I just started my period, my students have finals coming up, etc. But if I wait for a stress free moment it will never happen! 

In all seriousness, how difficult is it to step down? I started the patch yesterday and have had zero urge to smoke. Normally, I get terrible concentration issues/anger/sadness f I go more than four\-ish hours without a cigarette. I did have whacky dreams last night but they were actually kind of fun. I am worried that I will just get addicted to the patch and struggle with stepping down. I know it's going to suck, but what should I anticipate? Please do not advise that I just go cold\-turkey; the concentration issues are incompatible with my job.

Thanks in advance!

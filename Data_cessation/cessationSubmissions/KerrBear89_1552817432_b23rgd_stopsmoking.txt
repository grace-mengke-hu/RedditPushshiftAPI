Had a slip up :/

So I was 12 days in and went to the local to watch the footy with a group of friends who all smoke. I also have quit alcohol for the month to help me quit smoking so I was drinking soda water and lemon while my friends had beer wine and cider. I was doing so well until my partner and I had a big fight. I had two smokes and a glass of cider to calm me down as I was crying. I didn’t reset my date on the smoke free app but I was honest with the app as it allows me to say that I smoked and how many I have had. Can anybody relate to this? I haven’t had a smoke since but I feel terrible about making such a silly choice to smoke! I wish I had jumped in my car and had a drive with the music playing loud.

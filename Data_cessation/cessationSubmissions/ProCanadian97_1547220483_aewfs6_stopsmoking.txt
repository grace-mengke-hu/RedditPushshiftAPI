Bit Different, but starting to quit Vaping.

I recently hired a personal trainer to help me with some lower body issues and found out I have the lung age of a 65 year old. I am 21. Time to put that shit away. 

For those of you looking to make the switch, I am willing to send you all my vaping gear. Getting rid of it will be one thing that helps me quit.

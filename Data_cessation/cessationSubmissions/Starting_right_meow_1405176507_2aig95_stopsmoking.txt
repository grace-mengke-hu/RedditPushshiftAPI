Day 6... The demon sticks are out of my life for good

Last week I made the decision to quit smoking.  It's my third attempt in 10 years to kick my pack a day habit.  In a brilliant stroke of genius I decided to quit caffeine as well, cold turkey at the same time.  First, I'd like to let everyone know that this is a terrible idea.  That probably seems obvious to most people, but I was feeling like a badass.  The last two days have been brutal.  I started coughing up lung butter and my sinuses have decided to start draining relentlessly.  The caffeine has only added to the excitement with the added benefit of flu like symptoms.  I have decided to stick it out regardless of my uninformed choice to take on two chemicals at once.  I'm starting to feel like I'm through the worst of it.  This is one of the hardest things I have ever taken on.  I had a dream last night that I was running for miles and my lungs didn't hurt.  Once this cough clears up I'm going to start running again.  My dream inspired me to commit to run my first half marathon(or try to).  I enjoy seeing everyone else's stories on here.  It has served as a source of inspiration and I hope that I can stick with my decision.  Stay strong everyone, you can do it!

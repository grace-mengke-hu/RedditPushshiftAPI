Reset my app this weekend.

Somehow I feel like I've let the app down! Like I was lying to it. "Good for you, you made it so far without smoking a single cigarette!" Well, actually...

I was doing really well with this quit and I hope to keep it rolling. Started slipping over the past couple weeks; having the occasional cheat cigarette while drinking, that turning into one or two almost every day. I decided this weekend that I needed to cut out even the cheats if I was going to be serious. 

I'm conflicted on the idea of the occasional cigarette, once you get past the initial withdrawals phase. I know this sub feels very strongly that "there's no such thing as just one", and my recent backsliding is definitely proof of that. Even so, it's been important to my progress that the occasional slipup not represent an utter failure of a quit. If I saw things that way, I think I'd fully relapse after having just one, because fuck it, it was all for nothing right?

I think I need to just take the occasional slip in stride, realize it was a mistake, review my reasons for staying quit, and reset my app. That little bit of guilt is good, at least.

Today is a good day!

I made it one month today! I didn't even realize it until I checked my apps on my phone and tonight at 8 will be one month exactly. I never thought I could make it this far. It feels so great. I still occasionally crave cigarettes but my constant cravings are down to one or two a day and they are bearable. I'm so happy to have finally gotten to this point. Everyone just starting out, hang in there! It gets so much easier and it's so worth it!

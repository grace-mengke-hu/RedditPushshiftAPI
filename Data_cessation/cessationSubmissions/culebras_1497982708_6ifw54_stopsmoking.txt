One year ago, I received an email with my wife's birthday present

A one hour appointment to hypnosis therapy to quit smoking...

   When I left the practice it felt like an absolute waste of money, but I didn't want her loving present to feel worthless so I gave it a try to see how long I would endure. I had tried at least 10 times before, and was used to staying strong for the first 48 hours, thought I would suffer through that just to not disappoint her.
 Cue 11 months later, I am quite drunk not even entertaining the thought of a cigarette. 

I am pretty sure that hypnosis was not the main catalyst, but that every quit is a completely new experience. You may experience 10 different kinds of hell and suddenly accomplish a quit that feels like cheating. 

Never fear your next quit! (And when you accomplish it, stay the duck away from even one puff, you might waste your golden quit)

Edit: cute how Google autocorrects the word duck

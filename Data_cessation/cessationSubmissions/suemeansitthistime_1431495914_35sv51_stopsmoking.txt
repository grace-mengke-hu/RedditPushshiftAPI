Two weeks today yayyyyyy

I thought i would never say this........ but im a NON SMOKER....god that feels so good to say, it almost makes me feel like im a normal person and not the person people frown upon because you have that dirty habbit. Well i did feel for the first few days like i was a kid having my sweets taken away and felt sorry for myself, but hey i got through it, and feel proud of myself. My breathingis better, i can walk faster ....which for me is great for me , and i have  more energy. I no its still early days but im gonna be the one in control not my smoking.  :)  :)

Mindset is everything

Hello everyone ! First of all, I would like to congratulate everyone who made it and stopped smoking. I am more of a shy person but I had constantly read the subbreddit and I am truly proud of everyone.. because now I understand you and I also made the first steps in quitting cold turkey and.. there is no difference of personality, I am the same person as the smoking me. 

On the other hand, I will not wish good luck to anyone that tries to quit because you really don't need it. Nor encouragement. I just wish you a right and futuristic mindset ! We are  way too intelligent for craps like cigars. It's been a period but now it has to stop.

For me, to get the right mindset it took a couple of "about space and future" documentaries, some pages from Alan's book and a good documentation about health topics regarding lungs.

Thank you all for everything, every piece of information helped and every life story was mind opening in many ways. Do not lose strength, I wish you all a healthy life ! God bless you all but trust in Science :) !

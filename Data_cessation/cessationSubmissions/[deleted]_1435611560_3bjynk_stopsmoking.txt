Was thinking of ways to smoke...

Thank you to all the supportive people on here.  I haven't had a cigarette in 23 days.  In an ideal world I would say I feel great and all that jazz but truthfully I've been a cranky bitch.  I do feel proud I haven't lit up after smoking 15 a day for the past 15 years. But somehow I've been thinking about smoking in the future, at an upcoming wedding  and when we are having a party.  Justifying that it'll be ok and it will be ok to do it on special occasions.
I've read a few posts on here and the penny has finally dropped!  I don't smoke.  Never again!   Thanks, reading these posts really do help

Helping my boyfriend stop smoking - suggestions?

I will start by saying I'm not a smoker and never have been. I've lurked your subreddit for a bit and it's given me a much better understanding and appreciation of what a challenge quitting smoking is. 

I have never been able to stand smoking - the smell, the teeth, the waste of money, the breath. My boyfriend only smokes when he drinks (maybe half pack in a 4-5 hour period of drinking) and he's wanting to quit because he wants to, but also because he knows how much I hate it. He's spoken to his doctor and there is a trial program he's participating in to help him with the process. 

Here is what I've picked up from searching on here, please let me know if there is anything else that someone you love has done that helped you, or if there are any other do's (just as important, don't) that I should be aware of.

* Buy a fidget spinner or something for him to do with his hands
* Buy some dum dum suckers and gum
* Don't get upset if he gives into his cravings once or twice throughout the process
* Frequently compliment him on not smelling, or noticing that he's doing well
* Hold off on going out for a bit (I've already suggested we don't go to bars for a few weeks)
* Ask him each night how he did that day
* If he starts getting a craving, try to distract him or leave the area
* Acknowledge he'll be grumpy for the first few weeks
* Ensure that he's wanting to quit because he wants to, and not just to make me happy

He has two bars he frequents a lot and all his friends hang out at. He also works at one of them - so it's difficult for me to completely remove him from the situation. I don't want to keep him from his friends, so it may be an obstacle we need to work around. Suggestions around approaching that conversation would also be appreciated!

Thanks!!

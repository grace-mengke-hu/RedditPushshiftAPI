Fatigue

Just a quick general question. I'm feeling particularly fatigued and low on energy/motivation today. I've been off cigarettes for over 3 weeks, have been eating better and exercising a bit more and would expect energy levels to be increasing... but that's not the case today. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

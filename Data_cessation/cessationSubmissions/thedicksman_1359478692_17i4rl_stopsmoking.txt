A couple hours away from 60 days but just had my first smoking dream.

What the hell. My cravings have been minimal in the past 60 days. I read Allen Carr's Easyway and have been doing great. Only once have I had to remove myself from a situation to avoid temptation. I haven't cheated once, I haven't stood downwind intentionally or anything.

Last night I dreamed my way through a half a pack or more. Does anyone else have experience with this? I feel bizarrely guilty, but was relieved to have it confirmed that I was just dreaming. 

Felt like the first time in a long time that I thought of myself as a smoker who was abstaining, rather than a person who used to smoke. Shit was crazy.

If you've had these dreams, how'd you feel after? How'd you shake the trick your brain played on yourself? Thoughts? Opinions?

Please help me. Dealing with stress hasn't been this hard in a long time.

Relationship stress, hospital stress, job stress, making rent for next month type of stress.

I've been over eating a lot lately (and I'm a religious calorie counter, someone who has pretty good eating habits) but for the last few days I have been eating with reckless abandon. I'm doing everything I can not to smoke a cigarette, and a second later I'm thinking about finding a person off the street who's smoking and pay for a cigarette. I'm stuffing my face with food, and it's terribly clear how I used to manage stress by my reactions and responses right now. I want a cigarette so badly. I really want to stop eating so much to replace this feeling I have but would do anything not to smoke and give in. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Thoughts? Support? Anything will help. The most important encouragement comes from the inside I know, but my emotions are in overdrive. Please help me.

EDIT: Update - didn't end up smoking yesterday! We'll see how today and tomorrow goes, little by little.Thank you for everyone's encouragement, support, advice, and methods. Keep spreading that positivity that I got here, it really saved me yesterday. And for everyone's kind words, here's my favorite "acronym." TIME: Things I Must Earn. Would love to hear more input as time presses forward! Thank you all again.

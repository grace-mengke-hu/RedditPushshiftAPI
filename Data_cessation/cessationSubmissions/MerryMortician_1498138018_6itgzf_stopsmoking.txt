Day 4, after 23 years of a pack a day.

I have high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and have been having chest pains etc.

I'm 6'3'' 250lbs. I could stand to drop a few pounds but no one would look at me and think "he's fat."

I blame smoking for everything.

But 4 days ago I had ONE DRAG.... and pain shot through my chest and left arm. 

It was gone in seconds, as quickly as it began. But I put that cigarette out and haven't touched them since. 

I can already feel the enormous changes in my body. I feel euphoric. My blood pressure has reached NORMAL levels (still on my meds but seriously I've never seen it this low)   I've gotten my diabetes to nearly go away before by dropping weight. That's next. I feel like I've started over with a new lease on life.

Update... DAY 6!  Still holding strong! It's really not even that hard now.
Update... Day 9. The natives have started to suspect that something has fundamentally changed. There has been no smoke... no fire. I have experienced some flu-like symptoms, sore throat, cough etc but those are starting to get better. I am a nonsmoker.

Edit: 2 weeks. It's done. I haven't even thought about it until I saw my post history and decided to update.

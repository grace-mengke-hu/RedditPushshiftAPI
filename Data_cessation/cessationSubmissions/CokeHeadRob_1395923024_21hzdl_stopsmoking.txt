So, it's been two days so far and I have some questions

Backstory: I've been a smoker for around 4 years now, starting at the usual small amount and I've been at a pack a day for around a year and a half. Well, two days ago I decided I was quitting, so I did. Smoked the last one of the pack and haven't had any trouble since. I did get a little overly-irritated at my computer yesterday but that happens anyway.

Alright, here is why I'm posting. I'm waiting for all of the things I hear about quitting to happen to me. Do some people just get lucky and not feel it or have I just not given it enough time yet? Also, sleep, it's 8am and I have given up on trying to sleep after 5 hours of laying in bed. This happens to me anyway but I never have this much energy when it does happen.

So, there are my concerns. Any sort of advice would be great.

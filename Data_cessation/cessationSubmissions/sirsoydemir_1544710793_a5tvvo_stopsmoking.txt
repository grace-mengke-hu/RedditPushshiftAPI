Day #12: It's really great actually

Of course I've my cravings but I feel really great since that doomsday #5. I really feel free. I had only 2 cravings today and both of them made me want to vomit. Only thing is, I see myself smoking in my dreams, that causes me to wake up frequently at nights. Hope that will pass.

We got this people.

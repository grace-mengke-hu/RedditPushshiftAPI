Quitting smoking = taking control

It has been 13 days since I quit smoking. Since then, I have been through a lot of cravings and hard moments with plenty of crying and alcohol included. Some points I really felt like surrendering, but I did not. Now, I feel like this change of not smoking symbolizes something way bigger in me. It is equal to take control of my own life and learning to change, even when it is hard, and don't give a fuck about what anyone else thinks what I should do. No, this change is mine and mine only. This is new to me and very confusing. Does anyone have any thoughts?

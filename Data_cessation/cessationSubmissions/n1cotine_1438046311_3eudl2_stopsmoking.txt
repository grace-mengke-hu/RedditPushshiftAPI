Nicorette without blisterpacks?

Having another go with NRT, but I seem to recall last time around, Nicorette was selling a 4-pack of small boxes that dispensed the gum, instead of the traditional blister 8-pack sheets that are tough to separate and tend to cut things.  Has anyone seen these, or was I hallucinating?  Where can I find them again?  So much more convenient to carry one of the boxes of 25+ pieces instead of making sure I had enough gum to make it through the day.

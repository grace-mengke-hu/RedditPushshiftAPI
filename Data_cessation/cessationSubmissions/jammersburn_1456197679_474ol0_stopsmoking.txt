How did I get here?

If you'd walked up to me, 371 days ago, outside my favorite coffee shop, and told me that a year from now, I'd be smoke free for a year...I would have laughed in your face.

I didn't begin this with the intention of racking up a year of smoke-free days. I fight this addiction a day at a time, an hour at a time, sometimes a minute at a time. I wake up each morning, glance at the unfinished pack on my bookshelf with the date I quit sharpied on the front, and decide: "not now". That's all it is: 370 x a million "not now"s.

I hope dearly that I'll get 371 (million) of those. 

I hope you will too.

9 Months free, have a 20 pack sat in front of me

Hey guys, been lurking occasionally. Not sure what I am expecting by making this post but I guess it's worth a try, maybe a comment could sway me completely. on my way home from a completely failed presentation i bought a 20 pack of Sterling. I'm in my final year of university and the stress is really getting to me, I remember the past 2 years that cigarettes really helped me through my final exams and I have so much on my plate this year; case work, course work, a dissertation and exams. I need something to calm me down or de-stress and this is the only thing i know to turn to. Started smoking at 18, now 23 but I'm 9 months clean.

Slightly loose teeth after quitting.

One of the main reasons I quit was for oral hygiene (among the multitude of other reasons). After I quit two of my lower front teeth have become slightly loose. For the first few days (it is 3 now) my gums have bled a bit, but today they didn't at all. The gums themselves appear to look more healthy, but my teeth are loose.

Is this normal?

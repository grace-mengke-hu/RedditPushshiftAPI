[Rant] Relapse.

I quit in September. My brother fell on hard times and it really affected me. I bought a pack on Memorial Day and have been smoking ever since. I tell myself I'm over it and don't want anymore but can't seem to stop buying packs. I don't know exactly what answers I'm looking for. Just ranting I guess.

Quit day 2day! Casual smoker

What's up! I've been casual smoking for 10 years.  Need to quit.  When I'm drinking and socializing I smoke 10 cigs.  I rarely buy them aswell, I just bum when I'm drinking.

I've quit before, once for a year and once for 3 months.  But I'm back to smoking 10 cigarettes when I'm drunk and I need to quit, I hope by externalizing this it helps. 

My story...I'm 28, and have been smoking since I was 18 casually. My attitude has always been that because I don't smoke a lot and only when I'm drunk it's pretty harmless, it can't hurt me (I drink on average 2-3 times a month).  But in reality it's dangerous as fuck and it could kill me.  I'm a healthy guy, do yoga, run, lift weights, but I bet my lungs still look like shit from smoking when I'm drunk.  So today's my quit day, sorry I can't offer more motivation.  

If you want quit with me, it doesn't matter if you smoke 200 cigarettes a week or 2, I'll offer any support I can.

Peace.

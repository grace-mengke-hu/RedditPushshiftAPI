Need to vent.

Today is my last pack. 

I said that last week. And two weeks before that. 

I said that about once a month all last year. 

There are 4 left, just enough to get through my work day (the most stressful part of my life), with a full two days ahead of me being the only (now ex) smoker at my house. 

I've been smoking for the last 6 years, at a pack-pack and a half a day. I switched to rolling my own a few years ago, but they were non filtered. 

A trip to the hospital later, and I'm done. It's keeping food off my children's plate, which is unacceptable. 

Today is my last pack. There are 4 left.

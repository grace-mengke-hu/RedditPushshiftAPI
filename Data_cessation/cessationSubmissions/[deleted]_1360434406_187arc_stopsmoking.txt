6 days 12 hours 23 minutes. (Just a back story.)

I used to smoke a lot, and thought I would never be able to quit, even if I tried. I wasn't really ever supported, and trust me, support from family and friends REALLY helps me.

Shortly after I moved out my wife had our son. Seeing him, I knew I had to stop smoking. I didn't want to smell of smoke any time I was around him, or held him. I may be cheating a little bit, weaning myself off slowly, (vaping & gum) but I'm gradually using both less and less. 

Almost a week solid with no cigarettes what so ever. I don't reek of cigarettes, and I enjoy playing with my 2 week old son. 

I've never been happier, and through this sub-reddit, the support of my wife, and the voice everyone happens to give my son, I have to say thank you.

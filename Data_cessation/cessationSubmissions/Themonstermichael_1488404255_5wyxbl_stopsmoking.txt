So... Tell me more about your increased energy levels.

Probably the main health-related reason I quit was because I felt like I didn't have energy to do day to day tasks. Getting up in the morning is still the most difficult part of the day...
Anyways, I switched to an e-cig and haven't actually smoked in 16 days. I've already noticed myself breathing better and gym workouts are a bit easier. I have noticed somewhat of an increase in my energy levels, but I feel like there's more I haven't gotten yet. 


So, all you quitters out there who have gone long periods without smoking. How are your energy levels? How much better do you physically feel? Do you get up in the mornings easier? What do I have to look forward too?  


Give me a bit of motivation to keep going! As if I actually needed any more, that is.

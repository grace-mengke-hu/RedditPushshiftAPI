I'm making the solemn vow now, that my next cigarette is going to be my last one

I have done this too many times already.

It has worked in the past for 3 months, they were the best 3 months of my life.

I've been 5 days clean lately without any real problems

I'm tired of kidding myself, this is going to be it. I have to tell it to somebody somehow and this is my way of doing it.

Goodbye forever poison.

The 4C method

I’ve been smoking this whole time.  Quit, quit quitting, and basically wrestling with my guilt and shame over not quitting.  Wondering what it will take for me to quit.  Knowing I can, yet, after all is said and done, simply not doing it.  I came across [this video](https://youtu.be/gnSEbLX94Tk) this morning, and this is what I’m going to be using.  I want to quit by my one year sobriety date for stopping drinking.  That means under one month from now.  I hope that this video comes in handy for someone else also.  My favourite part of this method is the replacement theory, where when I crave a cigarette, I say to myself (or out loud):  “I want [air]”.

Proud of myself ! Germany woop !

I watched the WC finale at a public viewing event with about 15.000 people.

It seemed like everyone around me was smoking and so where the two friends with whom I came.
 
In the end i didn't smoke and I'm proud because it was a crazy match a crazy party and I had a lot of drinks!

Oh yeah and I am a german :)

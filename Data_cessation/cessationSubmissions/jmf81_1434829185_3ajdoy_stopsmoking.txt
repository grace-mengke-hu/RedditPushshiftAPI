I'm drinking and so far so good

So I'm on my third beer out of 8 and so far I've got no serious cravings. I'm just shy of four weeks and don't want to ruin it now! PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP (sorry I'm talking to myself)  Can someone threaten me and tell me that if I smoke, they're gonna break my legs ha :-)

Can I really never smoke another cig?

Been trying to kick this habit for a couple months had 3-4 quit attempts and my most recent I made it the furthest 12 days.

Immediately after buying a pack and smoking 2 cigs I realized these were pointless and did nothing to help me or change my situation. I got mad and threw away the whole pack.

The next day I bought 4 loosies.

The day after I bought another pack and now I’m back to a pack a day. Giving it another attempt real soon.

My thing is I was genuinely planning on quitting and indulging in the occasional cigarette 6-12 months down the line.

I have a lot of experience with recreational drug use, I’ve used opioids, meth, cocaine, ketamine, MDMA and NEVER got addicted because I respected those drugs and used them sparingly.

I was on 30mg of adderall prescribed for 7 years and went through bad WDs when I got cut. Over a year later I was able to just occasionally use adderall, and 30mg got me tweaking.

The thing is with my most recent relapse on cigs, I lost all control as soon as that first cig was smoked despite realizing immediately how pointless this is.

Am I fooling myself here? I can’t really beat this can I? I can’t occasionally indulge like I can in other drugs, even drugs I was previously addicted too?

I just want my next quit to stick.

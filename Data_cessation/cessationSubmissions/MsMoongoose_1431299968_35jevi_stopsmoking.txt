Break outs?

So, it's been about a week since I quit cold turkey. No real issues with cravings or mood swings past the first 48 hours, but in the last few days I have been getting some itchy red bumps on my body. Nothing on my face but from the neck down. In my 26 years of life I have had 2 pimples, no blackheads or blemishes to speak of, so this is quite an alien experience for me.

Has anyone else experienced getting spots on their body when quitting? I did a google search but only found discussions regarding facial break outs.

Edited to add: I've been smoking for 11 years with a one year break three years ago while I was pregnant.

long term nicotine withdrawal?

Hi all
First a quick thanks, as I have been reading this sub throughout my 'quit' to help motivate me. big, big thanks to all posters!!

Now, here's my question/ frustration. I am coming up on 50 days smoke and nicotine free. I quit cold turkey, listened to Alan Carr's book many many times over, used the 'smoke free' app, read this sub.
I was very inspired and dedicated and just....LOVING that I can breath and all of the benefits that have come with not smoking.
But
Over the last....well, 40ish days or so, I am just realizing that I have been depressed/angry/lacking confidence/sad...just, horrible.
Life has been very stressful, but I'm just not able to be rational about it. Only today did I notice that this funk pretty much lines up with me quitting smoking.
Today I was so unfocused, pissed off at life, hating everyone, and severely craaaaaaving cigarettes. I despise smoking, but I just want the cravings to stop.
So, I sucked down a nicotine lozenge from the stash I had to help me quit. This is the first one I have used. It actually helped.
Did the nicotine help? 

I'm confused and annoyed. 
- doing something positive and feeling horrible is frustrating
- most everything I read suggested that the nicotine withdrawal if the easy part and should have passed
- I specifically avoided nicotine replacements while quitting (note, I did have them on hand just in case, but never needed them) as I want to be free of smoking *and* nicotine. 
- Do I have to now figure out how to quit nicotine?

Any thoughts, commiserations, suggestions welcome

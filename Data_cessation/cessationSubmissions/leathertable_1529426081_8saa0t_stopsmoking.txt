I don't know if I can do it. Day 2

my addicted mind keeps telling me there's no reason to stop. i quit cigarettes and started vaping a while ago and that just made my tolerance higher. i decided to quit because it was too expensive. how long should i expect these withdrawals to last? i haven't even been using nicotine for a year yet (more like 10 months) so i hope not long. please someone give me advice

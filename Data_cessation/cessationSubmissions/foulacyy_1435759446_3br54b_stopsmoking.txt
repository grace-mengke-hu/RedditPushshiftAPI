36 days and....

I feel great. i can breath so easy, i run two miles four times a week, the pumps i get from lifting are noticeably harder and i am noticably more vascular.  endurance has started to increase profoundly.. (6'0 205lb competitive power lifter). The one thing i don't understand is i haven't had a single smoking dream, is this abnormal? I'll probably jinx it by verbalizing it lol.

I'm done.

I've been keeping up this bullshit since I was ~12. Both parents, and grandparents were chimneys. Seemed normal. 

I'm turning 30 this month. I'm sick of feeling tired, broke, smelling like microwaved barf and alienating myself. 

I just picked up Easy Way and I'm less than half the way through, but god damn its amazing. It makes so much sense and really does a great job of explaining the addiction. Should be done with it tonight. 

I'm honestly pissed off more than anything that I've let it go on this long. I've tried gum, patches, eCigs and cigars, never tried cold turkey. Though with the book, it's incredibly clear and I am relating to everything he says in there. 

TL;DR - Easy Way is a hell of a book.

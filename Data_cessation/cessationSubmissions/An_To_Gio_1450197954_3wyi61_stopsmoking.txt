Devastated.

I have been a non smoker for almost five months.
I have also been severely underemployed for a year and a half.
Last week a friend of mine told me that a high school in Genoa was looking for a teacher.
I called, gave my contact details and got called back on Monday (i.e. yesterday).
I went to the interview, made a wonderful impression, but didn't get the job because I'm not listed as a potential teacher at Dept. of Education.

So close, so far away.
I wonder whether it wouldn't be the same if I smoked, got drunk, got high or whatever.
I'm going to starve soon anyway.

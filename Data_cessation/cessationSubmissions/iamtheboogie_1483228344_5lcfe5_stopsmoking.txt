Depressions ans anxiety

Hi guys 

It's been a week without smoking and I have been incredibly depressed and wound up, finding enjoyment in nothing and irritable about anything. I have been diagnosed with these things but wanting to know if the nicotine withdrawal somehow enhances everything 

Cheers

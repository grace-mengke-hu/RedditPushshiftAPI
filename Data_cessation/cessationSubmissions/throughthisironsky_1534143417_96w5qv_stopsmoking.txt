5 months clean.

I've posted here many times.

In one of my more upvoted posts I talked about how I've quit many times, and these quit attempts ranged from half a day to 163 days. 

That is to say that in 2 weeks I will have not smoked for the longest time in my adult life. I have been an adult for 10 years now. I have tried to quiet probably 2 dozen times.

The story of my life: never give up

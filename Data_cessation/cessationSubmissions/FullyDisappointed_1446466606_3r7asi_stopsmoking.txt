Feel like I'm starting to get addicted

Hi all, I'm a new smoker, I started off with hookah a few years, I then moved up to vaping, and now cigarettes. I really don't want to smoke cigarettes but I keep getting urges, and then say fuck it, and buy a pack. One is enough to get rid of my urges for a day, but I hate it, and I don't want to get addicted. I have one pack right now, I just bought it, I have it in my pocket, but I don't want it. I don't know how to explain this, I started because of bad influence of old friends, I only do a few. How to I quit? How I get the urges to go? Do patches work? How do I get rid of this?

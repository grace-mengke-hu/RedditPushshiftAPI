Going home and know I will want to smoke really bad, what can I do?

Ive been quitting smoking at university, its going great. Only problem is I am going home for half term next week and ALL of my friends smoke. They sit inside and smoke, drive and smoke, eat and smoke... I used to be one of them, but not anymore. 

Of course avoid see them you may say? But these are my best friends in the world and I would rather smoke and die early than lose them, as dumb as that sounds. 

So how do I resist? Ive been doing well so far, but with the tempting dangle of a cigarette in front of me for a whole week, I need a distraction, prop or something. My friends are supportive and understand I want to quit but at the same time wont change their own behaviours... Thanks

Very stressy bad day! I really want a cig!!!!

Woke up this morning from my best friend's partner shouting at her (they live next door) I felt like I could either go hit him or have a cig, but I fought the desire off and just used my e-cig. 

Next I was making a formal complaint to a company regarding them not doing what I had paid for. Got nowhere just some keyboard warrior on live web chat completely disregarding and disrespecting me. 

The desire to go buy some cigs and spark up is so overwhelming right now, but I've locked my door and put my keys in another room and I'm sat using my e-cig whilst playing puzzle games on my phone to try calm and distract myself till it passes.

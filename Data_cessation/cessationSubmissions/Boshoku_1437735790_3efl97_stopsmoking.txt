Six months in and I don't know man...

As the title says, six months ago I had my last smoke. But I'm seriously considering to start it up again. I'm not stressed, I'm not depressed, it's not about socializing, it's about my peace of mind. Please note that I'm not craving one smoke, I want everything back.

My father developed COPD and it really affected him a lot. Six months ago, I woke up and asked myself if I really wanted to end up like that so I made a deal to "postpone" my cig for as long as I can. I still remember the **hell** I went through in the first days/weeks. The shaking, the time bending, everything. The most frightening thought was coming to terms that I will never smoke again, **ever**. But is it really worth it?

What kept me going strong was reading success stories here on r/stopsmoking, whyquit.com and a timetable of health benefits from quitting. I counted every hour and day and looked forward to seeing what would improve next. The benefits are meh. That super smell and taste you get? Yeah, the only thing I can smell better are farts and people who smoked making me feel sick. It sure has benefits like looking fresher and more vibrant. Deep breaths sure feel nice, but other than that, I'm underwhelmed.

Now, what bothers me the most is that ever since I quit smoking, my mind is in constant overdrive. I replaced those 7 minutes with extra practicing and working (I'm a guitarist). I replaced them with reading everything I can find. And I replaced them with video games and phones. I used to take my dog for walks all the time so I could have a smoke in the woods near my house. Now I actually spend **less** time outside in the nature because it's awkward walking around and it triggers me. I just feel like I lost those 7 min of relaxation and peace a cig would give me. As of recently, for 2 weeks now all I can think about is wether to smoke or not. This should **not** be the case when I'm six months in and angers me a lot. I try to distract myself by playing games and browsing on my phone. This gives me headaches and makes me feel even worse. And a summer of partying and drinking makes it even harder.

Sorry about the rant, I just needed a place to vent. I value my mental health more than coughing and occasional sickness so can you give me any good reason to continue feeling like utter crap?

TL:DR - Smoke free for 6 months, feeling like day 1 (for the last few weeks). While physical improvements are ok, the mental part is not worth it and I'm planning to start smoking again. Any reasons not to?


Ninja edit: Please don't suggest meditation as I'm not going to spend every craving listening to my thoughts.

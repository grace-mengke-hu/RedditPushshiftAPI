Is vaping really a better alternative?

I started vaping Monday and haven't had a cigarette/black and mild since Sunday. I guess my concern is that I'm not doing anything that's more healthy for body since I am still getting my nicotine cravings taken care of. I am aware that I'm not getting all of the carcinogens that comes with a normal cigarette, but is it really that much better?

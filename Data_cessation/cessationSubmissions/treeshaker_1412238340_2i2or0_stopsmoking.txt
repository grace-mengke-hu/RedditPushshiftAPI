Hey /r/stopsmoking

I'm having a really tough time right now. I quit on Sunday night after drunkenly smoking 90% of a pack in a couple hours on top of the realization that I've been smoking for almost exactly ten years now. Yesterday (day 2) was worse, but today is not what you would call easy.. Just tell me it gets easier.

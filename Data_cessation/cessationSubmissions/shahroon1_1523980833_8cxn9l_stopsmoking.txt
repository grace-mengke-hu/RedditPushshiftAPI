Cold turkey starting NOW

I have been a smoker for over 11 years now.i think i have to say this: Cigarettes have been a friend. They stood by me when i was feeling alone. They were with me when i was at my worst. But this relationship needs to end. i have decided to quit. Enough is enough. My nicotine craving is not more important than my health. I am gonna start a new pass time. Something to get my mind off. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
Just wanted to post here so i can have something to look at when i am feeling like smoking.
Here it goes.

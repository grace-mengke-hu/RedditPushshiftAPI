Stared vaping to stop smoking. Want to feel like it is an accomplishment, but don't.

I am on day 5 of a stop smoking attempt. I started vaping on Saturday, and immediately cut myself down from 20+ cigarettes a day to 4. Second day also 4, then 2, then 2 again. I am going to shoot for smoking a single cigarette today. 

In some ways this seems like a major accomplishment. I have seen some folks saying they just started vaping and never thought about smoking again. This hasn't been the case for me. I want to smoke. Not smoking is hard, even with regular vaping to stem cravings (18mg juice, for the record). However, I feel confident I could totally stop smoking. I could totally stop smoking today. I am just trying to be gradual about it. 

All that being said. I don't feel like I have accomplished anything. I have been feeling like I have just replaced one habit with another. Does anyone else who has gone the vaping route to quit feel this way? Did you ever begin to feel differently?

I think my long term goal is to completely ditch cigarettes and then wean myself off vaping to a point where I am not dependent on it (in that I don't crave it all day), can do it casually during triggered moments so I don't start smoking again (e.g., while drinking). But I wan't to convince myself I am actually advancing towards these goals and not just deluding myself while staying a hardcore nicotine junky. 

I guess the tl:dr of it is a week ago cutting down this much in favour of vaping would have seemed impossible to me. Now that I have done it, it doesn't seem like I have accomplished much at all.

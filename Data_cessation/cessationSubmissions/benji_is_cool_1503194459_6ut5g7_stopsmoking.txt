Pretty intense lung pain about a week after quitting...

I quit smoking about a week ago after having smoked over a pack a day for around five years. This is my first attempt. I have been using a vape sparingly throughout the day to help slightly with the cravings after having to ditch the patch because it gave me hives. 

My lungs just ache. I actually went to an urgent care and my general physician and got my lungs x rayed fearing I was experiencing a partial collapse of one of my lungs. After reviewing the x rays, they are essentially fine although one is slightly over inflated (apparently common for tall people like me). 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice or solutions? Ibuprofen is hardly touching it.

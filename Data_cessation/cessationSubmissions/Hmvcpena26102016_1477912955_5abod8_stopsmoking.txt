Day 5. Thank you all.

Hey everyone!
Reading some of the posts here has kept me busy and made me feel more hopeful... but still...

Ok. I'm a female doctor. I'm known as being a very good professional and a nice human being. But, I've never wanted to be an example. I have smoked for over 30 years (with a 2 years stop)!!

I don't know exactly why now, but I have stopped again 5 days ago!!
I'm struggling really hard, since I don't really remember being a non-smoker. All I remember from my first attempt is that I tried for someone else and lived for 2 years in frustration!
Now, I am doing it for myself! It makes a huge difference. I also seem to have all the support one can get, but I'm still feeling very frustrated, sad and upset. Cravings haunt me constantly. 
I try to do anything to trick my brain out of it, but nothing works for long... just a few minutes...
I am always waiting for the emotional pain to decrease soon, but it's still there the next minute, the next hour, the next day....It's so bad sometimes, that it gets me questioning myself about the reasons to justify this (never ending) frustration. I know ALL the theory. It doesn't help. 

On the other hand, I just can't believe I haven't broken yet!!!
Somehow, I realize that others experiences seem to reach my mind and reading you soothes a little my pain. Thank you!!!

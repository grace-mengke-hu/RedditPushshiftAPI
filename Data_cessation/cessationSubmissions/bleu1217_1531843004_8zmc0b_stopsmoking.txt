Got hooked again after three years, this morning i had my last cigarette hopefully

My mother in law passed away unexpectedly the week before finals and we moved in with my father in law who has dementia the week after finals. I started smoking again to deal with the stress and everyone around me was smoking but one pack led to another and i kept telling myself it was the last pack. My father in laws house needed some work so i told myself after we get settled into the house i would quit. Well its been two months now and with my father in laws outburts, the house work is taking a lot longer than expected. I gained weight, im not taking care of myself anymore and im just tired of it all. Smoking isnt helping so today im determined to stop making myself feel even worse. I can't control everything in my life but i am determined to start taking care of myself again. Wish me luck guys and thank you for this sub. I have been lurking for awhile and found a lot of motivation on here

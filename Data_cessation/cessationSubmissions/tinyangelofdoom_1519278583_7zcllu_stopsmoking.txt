I need some community support

I’m having a personal crisis. The job I spent years working towards has rejected me at every turn and I’m broke and sad and I can’t actually remember the last time I was happy. Im 4 months free of cigarettes and honestly it’s the only thing I want to do. I just want a cigarette. I just want to forget about how miserable I am. I just don’t want this to really be my life.  Please help me. Please remind me why smoking isn’t better.

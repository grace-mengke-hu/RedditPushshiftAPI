I'm new to this

Hi, I gave up on 2014-08-12 which makes it 5 days ago. Today was the hardest so far. Smokefree app is helping me a lot with missions and displays of how I'm doing health-wise, money-wise etc. I see some very impressive badges here! Which makes me think that even after over a year of quitting people still think about it... Is there a point when you forget about having quit? Does it get easier? Thanks for the platform of support.

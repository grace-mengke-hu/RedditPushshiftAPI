Really really struggling.

I feel so depressed. I want to quit bit every time I give in. Alan carrs easy way pissed me off cos it says your cravings are small. But I I have never felt so shit when I'm going through it. 

I have an ecig but the liquid I got is too strong so I need a lower strength. I'm broke this week so think it's a good time to try again.

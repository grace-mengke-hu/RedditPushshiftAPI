6 months smoke free today

What more can I say? Best decision of my life so far.

Smoking doesn't even cross my mind anymore, I feel a million times better and have saved a nice sum of money to boot.

For anyone hesitating, you can do it. I went from 30 a day after 10 years to zero, no nicotine replacement or other therapy. The worst time? The first 3-4 days. After that it was pretty much plain sailing. As long as you get in a mindset where smoking is NOT part of your life, you will get through it easily.

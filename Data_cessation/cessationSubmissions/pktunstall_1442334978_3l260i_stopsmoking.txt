Ran without getting a stitch today for the first time in years!

I jog around a local lake every couple of weeks, it's about 2 miles and I normally get a stitch and have to lie down for 10 minutes at the end of my route. Today, my run around the lake seemed so easy! No stitch, a faster time and I felt fine to just head home without my usual post-run collapse.

It could just be coincidence, but I think that my 8 days of smoke free living has given me a noticeable fitness boost. I feel excited to think what I'll be like in a month!

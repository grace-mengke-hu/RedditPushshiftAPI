Dreams

I've been quit a week shy of 6 months. I had dreams a couple of weeks in.. as if I had smoked and felt the guilt.

They left for a few months, and now they're back every night for the past few days.

No nicotine at all.. kind of disheartening since they're skin to nightmares almost.

Anyone else experience this?

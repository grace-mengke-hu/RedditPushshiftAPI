3 days and I feel like I'm going insane.

So it's been about two years I've been smoking half a pack a day, and before I was smoking about 2 or 3 smokes a day. Friday morning I was speaking with my boyfriend about how lately I've been feeling tired, nauseous and been coughing a lot after smoking. Anyways my boyfriend suggested maybe I should quit soon, stubborn as I am I decided to quit on the spot. 

So it's been three days now and the mood swings been driving me insane, I have been feeling nervous and very anxious. Also I'm having a lot of trouble falling asleep without having a smoke before going to bed. It's the first time I try quitting without cheating at night. 

Anyways if anyone have some tricks it would be awesome I'm feeling so exhausted from this.

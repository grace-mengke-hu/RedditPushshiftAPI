Just received my 4 week smoke free badge today!!

Just received my 4 week badge from the smoke free app!! Super proud of myself because 4 weeks ago I was laughing at myself for even pretending I'd give up smoking. One technique that really helped me was telling people who I don't talk to much that I stopped smoking. The theory is that you're less likely to succumb to smoking again if you've told many people you quit. I will admit to having a tough first week and my moods were very affected by quitting. Looking at the app a lot my first week really helped me. Being able to see the money I've saved and life regained really motivated be to keep getting those numbers up. Deep breaths also helped me during cravings but at this point I don't even have cravings which is amazing. To everyone else, I know quitting smoking is different for everyone and affects every body differently but try a push through. Your body will be so thankful as will your family knowing that you're quitting out something from your life that was literally killing you each puff you took. I've never posted on Reddit before, but I've coming to the quit smoking feed to read quite a lot so I thought maybe I'd throw a post up. 

Keep on not smoking everyone!!!!

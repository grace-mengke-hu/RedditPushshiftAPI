Well, it’s time to quit again..

I’m so happy to have found this group.  Here’s the back story.  I smoked a pack a day from age 15-32 (I’m 39).  I quit 2012 and did really good until a couple years ago.. 2017, that’s when wife started smoking and for a while I was able to avoid it until one day I gave in and had one... unfortunately, it felt amazing.  

So here I am today, trying to quit once again... this time it seems so much harder than before.  I have given myself a quit date, bought some patches and will be doing all I can to quit July 3rd.

I need to quit this time, I need to do it for my daughters, for my family and for myself.  I don’t have any friends so I’ll be here reading all these posts and using them as motivation.

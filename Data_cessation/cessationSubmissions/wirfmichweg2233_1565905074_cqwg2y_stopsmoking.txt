Day 8 breathing feels weird but good

I quit after about 4 years of smoking when drunk ( so a pack every weekend) and 1 year of actual everyday smoking (2-3 packs a week), and I really noticed how my nose and tastebuds improved today. When I went outside to pluck some herbs today(bartender) their smells were way more intense. I cant remember the last time  I took a breath as deep as I did today. I do it everytime I want to smoke to remind me what smoking does to my lungs( and it just feels sooooo good its kinda addicting).

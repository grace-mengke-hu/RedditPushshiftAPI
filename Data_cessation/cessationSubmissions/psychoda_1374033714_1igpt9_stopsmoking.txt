Trying to quit AGAIN

I quit smoking last december, after reading Allen Carr's book. It was all going well until I made that most common mistake: tasting a cigarette just to see how awful it would be. Well, you all know what happened after that.

Now I want to quit again. Is it worth reading Easy Way again? Will it be as effective the second time around?

Thank you all, keep strong.

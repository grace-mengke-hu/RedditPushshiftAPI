10 min questionnaire on smoking

I am conducting an academic study with-in a research group, regarding the urge to smoke. Participation involves a one-off survey which will take less than 10 minutes. Participants must be 18+ years old.

The study is part of a postgraduate Psychology program at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK. All details relating to my supervisor are available via the link.

Once the study concludes I will post the findings, and a report regarding the urge to smoke.

**Please be aware that this questionnaire will directly focus upon the urge to smoke, and you might find it personally difficult to answer. Any question can be skipped, or the survey abandoned, at any time.**

Thank you for taking the time to consider participation.

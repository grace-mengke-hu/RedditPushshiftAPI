40 days away from 3 years...

AND I'M STILL GOING STRONG :)

I'm not here much anymore (for obvious reasons) but I like to be proof that you can quit through determination and willpower! I quit cold turkey, and I'll never go back. If anyone ever needs advice on what worked for me, never hesitate to reach out.

Most importantly...if you fall, get back up.

Blessings to you and yours in 2018.

195 days and yet i couldn't help myself

This is just me ranting, if you dont feel like reading it, don't!

Yeah, so i just had a smoke....

I haven't had a cig for more than half a year, but i've been smoking spliffs with toasted/roasted tobacco for the entire period that i quit. A week ago i decided to quit the almost daily weed-smoking though, as my life had stalled and my motivation to change that was nonexistant. Now the first day of real spring has come, with a clear sky and a sun that actually carries a hint of warmth. My smoking friend came over, we sat on my porch and he put some chill-as-fuck music on and lit a cigarette. Even after having battled and beaten cravings the last 194 days of my life, this day was different and i found myself asking for, lighting and smoking a cigarette. I hoped it would taste like shit, and that i would have to put it out immediately, but hot damn if it didn't taste and feel great to smoke again.

Now i feel torn however. I was incredibly proud of quitting, and loved the easy breathing, fresh-smelling clothes and hands, the absence of light-headedness and all that jazz. On the other hand it DID feel damn great to smoke again...

I have been feeling like starting smoking again for the past few weeks, and I wasn't just craving cigarettes, but missing them, kinda like an old friend.

Dunno if it makes any sense, but i wanna smoke, without being a smoker. Fuck.

I don't expect you to solve my problems, just needed to vent i guess.
Oh, and moral of the story: Dont try smoking again, you might just like it, and it will be all the more confusing and hard to keep up the quitting.




TL;DR: Have been feeling like smoking for a while now, did it, liked it, hate that i liked it, and unsure of what to do next. Don't do what I did.

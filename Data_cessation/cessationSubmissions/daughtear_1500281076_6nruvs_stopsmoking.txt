What a monday!

I am being transferred to another clinic tomorrow with a last minute's notice. 

My brother underwent a minor surgery. 

A very important paper got reviewed and it is somewhat negative. 

It is not a bad day, everything will be sorted out eventually. They are all okay. 

But all I want is a smoke. Aaarrghhh!!!

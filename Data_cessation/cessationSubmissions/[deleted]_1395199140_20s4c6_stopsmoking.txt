The World Smells Like Garbage

So I quit four days ago and my sense of smell has increased greatly over the past few days, the problem is, I now randomly notice that society smells like garbage. Like, literally I will be walking around outside and randomly smell putride garbage until I just kind of get used to it, then walk by a stormdrain or something and bam, assulted with awfulness again.

I was wondering if my mind is playing tricks on me or if other people have also noticed how prevelant bad smells are once they quit. Also, will it get better? I don't want this. I don't smell flowers any better or anything like that, just my BO and garbage. I am lucky that this is currently my biggest complain, besides the bottom quarter of my lungs feeling like they are underwater, but it's bothering me. 

Sorry to rant, I feel ten times better today than I did 2 days ago, and nearly as good as when I was a smoker. It's really a stupid habit to perpetuate. I was lucky that I didn't for very long.

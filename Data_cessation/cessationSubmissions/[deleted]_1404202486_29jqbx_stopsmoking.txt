Can't seem to quit :(

Reddit, I am a 26 year old guy and I have been smoking roughly a pack a day since I was 18. I have quit for a total of 6 months during this time, in two 3 month stretches. Unfortunately I relapsed both times due to some reason or the other.

I want to get rid of this curse in my life and need tips on how to do it! Cold turkey is the only way for me. If I cut down and go out drinking/partying on the weekends I end up ripping through a pack in 4-5 hours (including what I smoked during the day) and the next day my lungs are always burning. 

I have very little will power with this and cutting down doesn't seem like an option at all. What are some things I can introduce into an extremely busy lifestyle to help me stay away from lighting one up and escaping to another dimension 20 times a day.

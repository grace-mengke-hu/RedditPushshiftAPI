Despite getting dumped by a girl I was madly in love with, I didn't fall back into the trap - 2 weeks free!

Hey,

I wanted to share something with you im really, really proud of. I was dating this girl for several weeks and was completely mad in love with her. One of the reasons I wanted to quit in the first place was because of her. However, she wasn't as much into me as I was into her and said that we should stop seeing each other. She gave me a lot of positive signs in the beginning and I was convinced it would work out. I was completely devastated. I sat in my car and hat the strong urge to smoke, crying. But I resisted. I didnt want her to drag me down even further. I drove home and went to the cinema on my own this evening and I am still proud that I didnt fall back into this trap.

Even though it still hurts because I was so in love with her, Im so proud of myself for not letting this fucking addiction take over me again!

Brainstorm: What do you do when you have cravings?

I think we take for granted how difficult it must be for people trying to go cold turkey and not having alternatives.  

We have many tips and tricks here from each and everyone of you. But I'm looking for a place to hold all possible scenarios and situations when you might need a cigarette. 

If you have specific examples that'd be great. 

E.g. what do you do in the morning when you have coffee and both habit and the specific desire for a cigarette smoke is highest?

Day 12 cold turkey - potential huge trigger happening tomorrow

I planned to spend first 3 weeks at my parents house to avoid my normal trigges and come home with some kind of progress that I will not want to lose so easily. Days 1-3 were ok, days 4 and 5 were horrible and the rest was better, less trouble with the cravings, more annoyed about discomfort from coughing and insomnia. I can truly say it was easier every day. 
I was not going to go out, but my high school friend has an unplanned detour here to our home town just for a day. I don't see him often at all so refusing to go out is not an option. He is a really heavy smoker and we're probably going to drink and talk a lot about old times and nostalgia. Even driving with him in the same car seems like a trigger. 

I already messaged him and told him in advance not to give me a cigarette if i ask, but I really hope I wont have to ask and be refused. He sent me some encouraging and supportive words and complimented me on making the right choice. All of that is great now but to be honest, I don't want a cigarette now anyway. But i need some advice what to do tomorrow night if a strong craving hits. I think i'll give my booze money to my friend and just have him buy my drinks and not have too many anyway. I feel ridiculous for overplanning everything so much, being in this safe bubble that i'm in now has to end eventually but I am afraid will be able to cope with true temptation.

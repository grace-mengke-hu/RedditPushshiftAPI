Question for people who have successfully quit. (Re: coughing, congestion and various pain)

Alrighty then. Quick background. I smoked for 25 years. Had my last smoke on October 14th. Yay! Thanks! I did it! I’m doing fine without smoking. Zero desire to smoke again. 

Here’s my question. 

Is this coughing and congestion normal? I caught a cold 25 days ago and it has lingered since. My doctor says it’s a combination of the virus and the fact that I quit smoking recently. I feel better as far as the cold goes but man I can’t shake the wheezing and coughing. Also I’ve been having various pains in my lungs that move around and come and go. Did this happen to any of you and if so, how freaking long does this last? It’s getting tedious.

I'm done

I just smoked my last one! I have had it and I don't want to have to get a second job because if this addiction. I have been trying to quit for a month but have failed. Today however I realized that if I quit then I won't have to get a second job. This addiction has slowly torn my life apart and I'm not going to allow it to anymore!

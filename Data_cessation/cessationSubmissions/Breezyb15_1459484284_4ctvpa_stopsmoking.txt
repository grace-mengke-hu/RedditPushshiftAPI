Had a couple of dreams with me breaking my streak.

So far I've been 2 and a half weeks without a cigarette... I really don't want a badge. I feel like anything that's reminding me about my quitting is making me want to smoke again.

Anyways, the past two days I've been having dreams about smoking again. It's pretty vivid and I can almost taste the cigarette in my dreams and that makes me want one when I remember the dream throughout the day. 

It's weird though because in the dream I'm saying "just this once" and then I start full fledged smoking again.

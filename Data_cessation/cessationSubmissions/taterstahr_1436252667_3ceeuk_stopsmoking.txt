Hubby wants to attempt stopping for the "ump"teenth time...16 year smoker. Suggestions?

There isn't a lot of funds to go around for patches and such,  but he wants to stop because it just seems to be a waste of money (i agree, but know how hard it it's to quit). Anyone have suggestions to help the process? He does have the very crabby attitude tendency, from experience of previous attempts.

I have been waiting for this day for way longer than 100 days. Thank you so much /r/stopsmoking!

As I truly couldn't have done it without all of the support I've received here. Smoking is nothing to me now, and I find any cravings I do have are small and usually shrugged off pretty quickly. I can breathe easier, I don't cough all the time, I don't smell like crap and I'm saving a ton of money. It's really the best decision I've ever made!

6 year chain smoker..

Hi I'm an Asian dude, 24 years old, started smoking cigarettes at the legal age of 18.

I stopped smoking for almost 6 months years ago when I was still in college but ended up smoking again.

I am currently trying to stop smoking..
I am a heavy smoker... as ancestors were...

For the last 2 to 3 years I tried different stuff and failed...
1. Exercising, Heavy jogging and pushups since there is no gym available. been doing it for three years..
2. Meditation, been doing it for two  years..
3. Stopping from time to time.. Probably the longest I stopped other than my 6 months was 2 weeks... but I always realized that I have just lit a cigarette and was stuck in my lips without me being aware of it..

Although I still do heavy exercises, meditation, and stopping from time to time I, still I don't stop..

@__@ What can you say about this fellow redditors?

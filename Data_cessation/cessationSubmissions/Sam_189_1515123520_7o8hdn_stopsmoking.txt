This is the longest I've ever quit.

I know 9 days isn't much. But I'm pretty proud of myself. The longest I've ever quit before was 7 days, so I beat my record. I want it to be a lifetime this time. The cravings are really bad, and I've been tempted to have "just one" many times, but I keep pushing forward.

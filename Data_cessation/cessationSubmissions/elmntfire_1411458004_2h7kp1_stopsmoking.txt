Celebrating 100 days a whole week late!

I'm damn proud of what I've managed to accomplish on this journey with all of you.  As a persistent lurker, I've had the pleasure of reading your advice and silently making my way through the cravings and the lashouts from withdrawal.   But after forgetting the habits that made me smoke, it has become all too easy to forget that this isn't over even though the urges are down to a whisper in times of weakness.  Hell, I forgot my quit date for a whole week.  I just wanted to thank you for all of the help and here's to another 100 days and many hundreds after that!

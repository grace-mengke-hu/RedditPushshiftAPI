Suggestions on how to stay social with the smokers without smoking...

I love to smoke when I'm out drinking.  It gives me something to do with my hands.  It breaks an awkward silence, its an excuse to go outside and see who's out there that I can engage in conversation.  I know the simple answer is ignore the awkward silence, put your hands in your pockets, go talk to someone regardless, but I'm looking for a solution regardless.  I joked with a friend yesterday that I should just take a sheet of paper outside and fold a paper airplane while talking with the smokers.  I know this is silly, but it gives you an idea of what I'm after.  Has anyone found any socially acceptable other things to do when heading out with a smoker?  Appreciate your comments.  I've stopped for a few days and seeking advice.

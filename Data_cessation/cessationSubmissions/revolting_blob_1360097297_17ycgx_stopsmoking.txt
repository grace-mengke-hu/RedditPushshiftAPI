Feeling crappy when you quit is normal.  But do yourself a favor...

Aside from the cravings, there are a wide range of possible negative things you could be feeling when you quit.  Dizzy, foggy head, unable to concentrate, and on and on.  A lot of the symptoms can be caused by blood sugar level fluctuations and can be dealt with pretty easily by adjusting your diet for a short time.  For most people, these withdrawal symptoms will clear up after a few weeks and you'll be on your way to feeling great...  

But in a few weeks if you're still not feeling well, do yourself a huge favor and go see your doctor!  It's been almost two years since I quit, and I've grown accustomed to the irritability, cloudy head, those type of symptoms.  For a long time I just accepted it as part of what happens when you quit smoking.  I got used to feeling shitty all the time and just wrote it off as inevitable.  I finally went to see the doctor when the problems escalated from being a minor annoyance to being unable to concentrate on anything, feeling incredibly weak, having periods where I was unable to understand what people were saying to me, almost blacking out at work and staggering around like a drunk, unable to walk or talk properly.

Part of my problem turned out to be a severe vitamin B12 deficiency - though I'm not sure what's caused it.  But after only a few days of supplements, I'm already feeling 100% better.

So if you don't feel absolutely awesome after a few weeks, save yourself months of discomfort and go see your doctor!

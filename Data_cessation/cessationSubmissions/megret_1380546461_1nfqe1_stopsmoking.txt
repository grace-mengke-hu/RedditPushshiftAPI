A year ago today, I was a 3-packs-a-day smoker. A year ago tomorrow, I wasn't.

I quit through a regiment of cussing, snacking, and bribery.

That voice in your head that tells you you need to smoke is a lying sack of shit. That is not your brain talking. That is your addiction talking. Every chance you get, you tell that little shit to shut the fuck up.

Examples:

**Voice:** You’ve had a rough day! How can you be expected to quit on a day like this? You deserve a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, dummy. What I deserve is fancy-ass Digiorno pizza for dinner and two motherfucking king size Reese’s cups for dessert


**Voice:** You’ve gone three days without a cigarette! Man that’s pretty good. You know what you should do to celebrate? Pick up a pack or two on the way home!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, asshole! Are you fucking stupid? To celebrate three days of not smoking I am going to go buy a $5 drink from motherfucking Starbucks and then go ogle hotties on the street. Fuck you.

**Voice:** Wow, so five days without smoking. Today was kind of rough, huh? You should take it easy, you know? Go pick up a pack, ease into this quitting. Just step it down. It’s not like anybody knows you’re trying to quit, except one or two people. And everyone kind of expects you to just keep smoking anyway.

**You:** Shut. The Fuck. Up. Bitch almighty of the planet Dumbfuck, just shut your ignorant fucking hole.


**Voice:** Look at you! You made it a whole week without smoking! Holy shit! Can you believe it? Those assholes thought you’d never make it. You sure showed them! Boy, glad that’s over. Welp, now’s as good a time as any to go pick up a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up! Are you fucking stupid? This isn’t going to happen. What’s going to happen is me and my pajamas and this 2 pound bag of Jolly Ranchers and you shutting the fuck up, idiot.


**Voice:** You could just have one. No one would blame you.

**You:** I would blame me, you weak fucking sack of shit. Shut the fuck up.


**Voice:** Damn, don’t you take breaks at work any more? You just come in here, clock in, stay inside all day. Don’t you want to go outside? I’m sure you can find a co-worker to bum you a smoke.

**You:** You fucking twerp. Leave me alone. I - wait. Yeah, outside sounds fine. I’m heading out for some Starbucks. Nice try, idiot.


I also bribed myself. A bribe for each non-smoking day, each non-smoking week, each non-smoking month, and at six months, and at a year. Examples:

Every day: an app or song, or something around $1. Sometimes I’d just go into a dollar store and see what’s up.

Every week: Something around $15, a book or album (I was starting to listen to the blues and that’s kind of a hassle to get your hands on in an instant-gratification sort of way. I live in Chicago; it's pretty easy to find in a store here.)

Every month: Something around $50-60: going out for a nice dinner, a new article of clothing, a video game, whatever.

At six months: Something around $150

At one year: TBD, but it looks like I’ll be picking up a cheap little tablet.

So, when you’re struggling with falling off the wagon, when “just one” sounds like a good idea, or when “I deserve a cigarette” is pounding in your brain, just remember: you deserve better than a smoke, and that little voice is slowly trying to kill you. You're better than this, and you're gonna be fine.

**Edit** Another thing that really helped was that I'd put my milestones on Facebook, Twitter, etc. It didn't matter if it was a 3-month milestone or just some random day ("104 days of no smoking!"), the positive feedback from people I actually knew in real life was a big help, too.

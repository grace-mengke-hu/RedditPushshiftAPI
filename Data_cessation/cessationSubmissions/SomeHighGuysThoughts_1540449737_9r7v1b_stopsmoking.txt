Im tired of this...

its 11:40 pm, 10/24/2018 ran out of ciggarettes and i dont feel like driving the 10 miles round trip to get some.  


My lungs are always fucked, my nose is constantly running. I know I cant smell or taste. Saw a post about stopping smoking, Looked up this sub and read a bit more. Thank you for existing because It made that switch tick over that made me want to drop this habit.  


The biggest thing that scares me is I got really sick once and quit for a week and a half, and chocolate icecream tasted TOTALLY fucking different, and i kinda enjoy the way it tastes when I smoke more but, eh, I havent even had chocolate icecream for a year.

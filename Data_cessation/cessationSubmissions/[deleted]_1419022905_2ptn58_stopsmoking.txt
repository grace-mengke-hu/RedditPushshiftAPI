70 days smoke free, but...

It's incredible to have gone 70 days without a cigarette and of Course I am proud, but i must admit that I still miss them. Maybe three times a day I start to think how soothing a cigarette would be.  Sometimes I notice myself obsessing over reason why i should smoke. I feel like I lost my best friend. I feel like I can't organize my thoughts, especially during stress.  A few times I've cried because I am so stressed, I hold my fingers up to my lips to get a drag, and my fingers are cigaretteless.  and my brain is telling me all these problems will go away if i have a cigarette. Will i feel like this forever?

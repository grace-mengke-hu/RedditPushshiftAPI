One month in and coughing up a lung

I'm a month free of cigarettes, but now I'm coughing more than ever. From what I've researched, it has to do with the cilia in my respiratory tract coming back from all the smoke damage. The only problem is the coughing has become a problem. I keep getting dirty looks at work and on the subway. I can't control it. 

Has anyone else had this problem? Are there any tips to getting through this phase quickly?

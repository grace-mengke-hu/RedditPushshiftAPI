Would like some advice to help my gran

ok I'm going to start off by saying it may seem hypocritical to comment on anothers health as my lifestyle isn't the healthiest (get hammered often, neglect sleeping etc, averagestudent.txt)


Anyway this isn't about me, it's about my gran, she's turning 79 this year and has been smoking for the last 40/50 years, sometimes a pack a day, 2 at some points. I love her to bits but I can't help but feel far too concerned about her health, I'm living away from home and I can't help but feel just the slightest bit of dread that her, what I think of as poisoning herself will finish her off.

She's...well, stubborn in her ways, she doesn't WANT to stop it seems, both me and my mum have tried and tried over the years, tried giving her chewing gum, filters, electronic cigs, but she's turned them all down in favour of yup, you probably guessed by now...
It's affecting her in so many fucked up ways, she's short on breath, her breath  "rattles", coughing often and hell, even her personality...she gets...well,  manipulative. Yes, I've tried just not getting them but she plays off a whole guilt trip thing, she'll make you feel like crap in every way that she can or even just ignore you completely. Even if you refuse she has someone else get them instead.

But like hell am I ever gonna stand idly by and just let her smoke herself to death, is there anything I could possibly do to help her?

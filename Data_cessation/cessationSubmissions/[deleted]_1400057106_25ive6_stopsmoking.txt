It's time to give it up. Any thoughts or ideas on going cold turkey?

I just got back from a short vacation from Las Vegas, where smoking is welcome almost anywhere. Of course I took advantage of this, and smoked like a chimney the entire week. I came back home to hear that my step father, (whose been a smoker his whole life) is getting a lot worse from his lung cancer. It saddens me to see him waste away, and scares me as well. Although a lot of my friends smoke, my boyfriend and mother who are smoke free support me all the way! I think this sub-reddit would also be a great place to seek support, and perhaps share ideas to help keep motivated. Where should I start? Throw away my cigarettes and lighters? Perhaps clean my car of the awful smell? any other ideas?

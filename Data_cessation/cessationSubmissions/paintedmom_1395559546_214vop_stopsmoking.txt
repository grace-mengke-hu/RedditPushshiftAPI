Slipped after 2 years!

**possible trigger warning** 
2 years ago I quit cold turkey after a Caesarian section.  A year before that my husband quit. This winter has been really rough on us and he started smoking around Christmas time. He hid it well but I caught the smell about a month ago and I felt like it was the first month again because I started thinking about it constantly.  Two days ago I found a half smoke on the porch and when I was feeling completely overwhelmed I lit it and choked back a puff or two.  

It felt like meeting an old friend. 

Tonight as I walked past his coat I smelled the unmistakable aroma of a half butt and grabbed it. I looked for this sub as I smoked it. I don't know what I want from writing this post. I feel sick, have that awful familiar heavy lungs and burned taste in my mouth, stomach feels Ill. 

I guess I just want to say to be ever vigilant. Don't slip for an instant because ohmygawd that's such a nasty addiction and I really feel the pull to start again. 

Here's hoping we can stay non smokers for the rest of our very long lives. I don't want my children to watch me whither and die from some horrid self inflicted disease. Good luck to all of you. It's the best feeling in the world to say  'I quit'.

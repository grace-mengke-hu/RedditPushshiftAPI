11 days! 3 days shy of 2 weeks.

Where has the time gone? I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms this time around. When they say don't even have just one, they mean it. I'm back to quitting again after about 8 months of starting back up again. The worst was a couple months ago when my relationship ended and I was smoking a pack every 2 days. I avoided the worst part of quitting but now comes the part where I stick to my resolution. Good luck everyone out there...you can do it.

Proud to present you my Quit Smoking App

Ever since i came across this subreddit 4 years ago and got enormous amount of help from several users that got me through my journey i dreamed of making a quit smoking app to maybe help a couple of people stay on track.

After breaking my hand 2.5 weeks ago and getting some extra free time i decided to start coding, and now i can finally present [Easy Quit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herzberg.easyquitsmoking) to this subreddit.

Hopefully it helps some quitters here to drop that evil for good.

Let me know what you think :)

Best Regards
M

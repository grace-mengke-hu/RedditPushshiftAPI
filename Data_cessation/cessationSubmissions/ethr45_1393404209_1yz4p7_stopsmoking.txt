Boyfriends friend moved in, heavy duty chain smoker... Help!

Normally I'm okay, haven't had many cravings since I quit 5 months ago, but now I'm so close to buying a pack. Before this guy moved in my boyfriend told me he had quit smoking and it would be okay. He hadn't quit smoking, and I am not okay. He's only been here three days and I'm already climbing up the walls, biting my finger nails and completely on edge. I've asked him to smoke away from the house but the wind blows it in and my house reeks of cigarettes. I have no idea what to do or how long I'll last. I've never had such a strong craving before!! I wish I could get this guy out of here but both he and my boyfriend think that I'll get over it and move on. 


If there's something I can do for these cravings, please please help. If you have some advice on how to get this insensitive dick out or what to say to my equally insensitive boyfriend please let me know. 

Thanks so much guys!

Just quit for the second time

Just about 1 month shy of my two year mark, I had relapsed, and over the course of two weeks smoked barely, and only in the evenings, and then the second week daily, and twice at lunch break.

Both my fiance and I endured this relapse, and have felt terrible about it.  We quit again last night.  When I first read Allan Carrs book, I marked it all up in highlighter.  Good thing too, as it made it easy to review and something to read over together out loud.  Now we have a new quit date, one we get to have together.

Just felt like sharing is all.  Thanks for listening.

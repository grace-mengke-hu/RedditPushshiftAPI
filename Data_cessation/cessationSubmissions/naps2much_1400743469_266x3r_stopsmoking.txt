2 weeks smoke free

As the title says, I haven't smoked in two weeks, but I still get some cravings every now and again. This usually happens when I have a drink or coffee. I had a drag from one of my friends cigarette yesterday during my morning coffee, but it didn't feel right and I kinda chocked on it. I'm scared I might relapse.
Any tips?

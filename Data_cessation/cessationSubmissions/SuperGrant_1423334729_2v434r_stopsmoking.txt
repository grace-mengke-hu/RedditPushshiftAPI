First day back at weekend job since quitting.

I work in a shop on weekends to subsidise the little money I make from my self employed activities, and today's my first day back. I used to go outside during my breaks and smoke maybe 2 or 3 cigarettes in 45 minutes. The cravings (which were subsiding) have gotten crazy bad today and I'm clawing at the walls! This is definitely a trigger.

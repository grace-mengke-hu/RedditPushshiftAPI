Day 4 - Some Questions

My last cigarette was on Sunday night around 11:30 PM EST, and I have to say it hasn't been as bad as I feared it would be.  My cravings are few and far between and lacking in intensity.  BUT since I quit I have slept 12-16 hours a day(including night time sleep).  I was fearing having trouble sleeping, but it seems I have quite the opposite and am extremely exhausted and will nap for HOURS.  Is this normal?

Info if it helps: 25 y/o M, smoker for 9 years, heavy for 7 (pack a day increased up to 2 packs a day near the end for a year or two).

About to get Circle 3

This week was *a lot* easier than the first two. There were several times I forgot about smoking altogether,  even at trigger points. 

Still, tonight I considered smoking and so I weighed the pros and cons. The *only* potential pro is the chemical nicotine hitting those reward centers in my brain. That's it. It won't relax me, it won't make me more artistically inspired, it won't make the day brighter. It's just a disgusting, smoky, ashy drug with no real value other than deceiving the chemicals of brain.

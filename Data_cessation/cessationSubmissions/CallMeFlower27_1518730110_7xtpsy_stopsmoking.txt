Mood Swings

So I stopped smoking this morning. I finally realized how horrible I felt after I’d smoke a cigarette. 


I only smoked for about 5ish years (the first three years I was more of a social smoker, would mayyyyyybe smoke a pack a month, last 2 years I was at a half pack to a pack a day). 

All has been good so far, but this isn’t my first rodeo (aka attempt to quit #579) and I know I will start to experience mood swings either tomorrow or later this evening. 


Here’s the thing. For me, (I have no idea if it’s like this for everyone or if it varies from person to person) my mood swings are more repressed emotions and feelings about very specific things in my life, than just random highs and lows. I knew cigarettes were making me numb, but not to that extent. 

 Does anybody have any advice on how to deal with them? Aside from addressing the things that come? Usually I’ll just cry it out and wait for it to pass, but I don’t always have that luxury when at work (SOOOOO fun to burst into tears during a fitting jk). 

Keep Fighting the Good Fight.

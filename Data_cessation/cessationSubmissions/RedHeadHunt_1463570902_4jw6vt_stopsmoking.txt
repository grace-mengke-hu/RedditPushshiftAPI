1year!!!!

I am at one year. One flipping year. I still have cravings on bad days but I know I don't need them. It has been one of the worst years for my health and that has caused a ton of stress. But I also know I am not hurting myself regularly. 

The medical issues I have been dealing with would have been exasperated by smoking and I have been curbing these issues thanks to not smoking. 

I was smoking 1.5 packs a day, working in kitchens and being super destructive to myself. All those habits have been changed and I have moved to food manufacturing. Now I just need to start working out so I can be more fit and not fat.

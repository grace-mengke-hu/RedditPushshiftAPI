200 Days Is A Nice Marker

After 45 years of smoking... 30 of those fairly heavily, I quit, cold turkey --200 days ago.  Feeling good.  

Last night went to a Friday-night party on a friend's roof in the big city.  About ten dear, old friends there, all but one heavy smokers.  Oh! how I used to enjoy having smokes with beers and talks.  Everything's the same except I don't smoke and I don't mind in the least that others do... and boy were they smoking last night!  We were outside and still my clothes smelled of smoke when I got home.

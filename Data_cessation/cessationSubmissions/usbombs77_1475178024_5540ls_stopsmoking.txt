Chantix

I was in a motorcycle wreck three weeks ago and while at the hospital a nodule was found on my lung. The doctors have assured me it's not a cause for concern but it was the kick in the pants I need to stop smoking. So I went to my doctor or and was prescribed chantix. I'm a little concerned about it and at this point haven't taken it yet. Has anyone here been successful with it?

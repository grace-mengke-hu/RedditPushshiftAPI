Need help in convincing my college roommates to quit smoking

This past February my father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, as someone who has been a non-smoker his whole life. This incredibly devastating experience has turned my eyes to my roommates at college, all of whom smoke about 4-5 cigarettes a week. I know this is only a small amount relative to many people who are addicted, but I would still like them to stop. 

First off, am I wrong by assuming this is still terrible for the body? They're under the assumption that this small amount coupled with the fact that they'll "Probably stop soon postgrad" means that they will be fine.  Secondly, if I want them to stop, what method would be best in convincing them? They're just under the impression that its not hurting them anymore than a few too many drinks. 

Best,

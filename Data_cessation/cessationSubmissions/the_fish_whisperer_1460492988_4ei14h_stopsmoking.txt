Thank you for my first year as a non-smoker

I stumbled on my previous attempt but today makes my first (leap) year as a non-smoker. Thanks stopsmoking. I wouldn't have done it without you. We always talk about our techniques for quitting, but I have to say, at the top of my list, is this sub.
Thanks everybody, you guys rock.

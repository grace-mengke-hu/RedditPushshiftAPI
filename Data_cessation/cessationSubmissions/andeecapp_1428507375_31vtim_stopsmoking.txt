An amazing bonus benefit of quitting

So I posted yesterday about being quit for a year (WOOT), but something I just noticed on my QuitIt app: I've saved 23 DAYS of my time since quitting. That is 23 days worth of time I'd have spent smoking (not 23 days of my life saved, though I guess arguably it is that as well). 

It really just hit me super hard: 23 DAYS! That's more vacation time than I get from my employer! That's nearly a month out of the year I've quit. Think of the multitude of other things I've done with that time instead of stopping to light up and puff. 

Just wanted to share this extra motivator with the community!

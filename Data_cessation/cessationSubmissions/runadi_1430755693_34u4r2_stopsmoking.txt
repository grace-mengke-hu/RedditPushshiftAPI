Over 1k days and how I finally stayed quit.

Like many of you I started smoking at a young age and tried a million times to quit. I would say in the last five years of me smoking I went to a summer time smoker because I hated going outside in the cold. 

The big trick regardless of what ever method you chose (I personally read a book), is to never have any kind of nicotine again. This means cigars, vapor, hooka, ect.. Just one puff of any of those WILL get you back on the path to smoking. Resisting this one puff of any of the new forms of nicotine are just there to trick you back. 

As any smoker on how they got smoking again after quitting. It's always because of that one time, so skip that one time and just realize that it will get you smoking again. You have come this far why start all over :)

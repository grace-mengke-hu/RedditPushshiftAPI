Drinking and smoking

Hi reddit!
Recently i started my second serious quit attempt after smoking for 8 years, last attempt lasted 14 days until i were going to a friends graduation party from being a carpenter. How do you guys manage to stay away from the cigs while drunk, because every time i get this feeling that no problems, i can smoke on without a problem...

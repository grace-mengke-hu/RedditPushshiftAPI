Avoiding the drunk cigarette?

I quit for 6 months last year and was pretty proud of myself, i was in school
and not partying late, maybe a beer with roommates at home after class, but then summer came and I went full bore one night and wound up first bumming a couple smokes. drank a bunch more and then caved and bought a pack late at night and smoked nearly the whole thing, that was the end of it all as the next day the cravings felt like they came
back full force and i finished the last few
cigs to calm it down and ease the hangover. i was back to square one it felt like and have been doing 3-5 cigs a day ever since. 

My question is what do you try to keep in mind off cigs while drinking socially? this has been a big obstacle for me because my judgement and inhibition slips progressively as the night goes on, but i dont want to leave early and miss out on stuff to aboid being tempted. thoughts?

I am certain I will never smoke a cigarette again... but... I am vaping.

Hi everyone,

I wanted to get your thoughts on this.  I am a (former) 20-year pack-a-day smoker who has always wanted to quit, and I sort of "accidentally" quit this past Saturday, but now I am determined that I will never smoke again (just making the decision and not doubting it / doubting whether I can do it seems to have helped immensely... it's such a mind game!)

However... It's important that I not be grouchy, because my wife has also quit.  I have to take care of the kids (two boys, ages 4 and 0) a lot, and she is extremely sensitive to my moods; if I am the slightest bit grouchy or less than perfectly cheerful she will explode and reach for a pack of smokes.

So... I have been vaping.  I am using an NJOY vape pen and it's great for me, but I want the hive mind's opinion on some things:

1. Do I really even have the right to say I have quit smoking?  I feel great and it's a big positive change for me; I love not stinking, I am breathing easier and I am starting to be able to taste things again, plus I feel great to be finally free of cigarettes... but at the same time, I am aware that I really love my vape.  I think it will be easier to quit the vape now that I am settled in with not smoking tobacco, but... well you get the idea.

2. Is there anything you guys can point me at, including personal experience, targeted at the risks of vaping vs heavy smoking like I used to do?  How badly am I endangering my health?  How badly am I endangering my recovery?  Most of what I see about risks vaping is more focused on comparing it to not smoking at all and breathing, as one person put it, "pure Alpine air."

Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide.

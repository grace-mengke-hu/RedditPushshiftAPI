12 Days

I do not know which switch flipped this time but after trying *everything* through the years - from CT to hypnosis to chantix - I just decided I no longer wanted to be a smoker. I suddenly saw how every day or every pack was always going to be my "very last" and those packs, days, weeks turned into years... Getting older helps, I no longer have enough tomorrows to spare.

I simply stopped *buying cigarettes* and now I am on Day 12. I have had some difficulty - irritability, sadness, craving but I ask myself "What do I really want?" and my resolve is reset. 

Of course, I wish I had not waited this long to quit but there is no looking back now. 

I LOVE not smoking. My hair, clothes don't stink, my chest isn't aching, my sleep is sound and I've saved $100.00. I honestly cannot imagine myself smoking again. 

I read a study on the brain scans of smokers/addicts and how the prefrontal cortex gets hijacked and a smoker/addict literally loses the capacity to assess the damages of their choices to smoke/use. Maybe that is what flipped the switch for me, the learning that I had to override a primitive part of my brain with a more evolved part of self...In any event, I was able to see how my future self was entirely made up of the choices I make now and I could no longer postpone it. I got habituated to a self-loathing that is now incomprehensible. 

I am really just on here to say that if I can do it then anyone can do it. After years of smoking and shame and unceasing efforts to quit I am finally free.

I need help for the first time since I quit

This isn't urgent. I'm not sitting with a cigarette in my hand debating whether to smoke or not...

But fuck...recently I miss it. I haven't had close calls. I know why I shouldn't  smoke. I know that I will regret it if I do smoke. I know all of the joy I associate with cigarettes is some fucked up web of addiction and relief. I know I don't want to die from lung cancer.

But for the past few weeks my desire has been through the roof. 

I don't know what to think. I've offered many words of support and advice on this sub since I quit, now I'm calling in the favor. No offense but I would like to hear from people who have been successful in the long run, not overzealous people on their tenth day (no disrespect, I just want to hear from those who are in my shoes)

Please help

Not today.

It’s been a month and a half since I quit and I keep thinking about smoking today for some reason. I have been dealing with some stressful life stuff, but man, I haven’t had any cravings like this since quitting this time around. 

I know what buying a pack leads to, it just means that I’m gonna smoke again for a couple of months, and then have to quit again. It just prolongs that pain of quitting. I’m still having to talk my asshole brain out of it, though. 

It’s crazy how strong the addiction is - there’s so many reasons why it’s bad, and really it’s a dumb drug, there’s not even much of a payoff for doing it, but I’m still having to sit through cravings and talk myself out of it.

Oh well. I know that I can make it through the rest of today without smoking. I’ve made it through a lot of days without cigarettes, so I know that it’s possible to make it through this one as well. So I’m not going to smoke today. I can do that.

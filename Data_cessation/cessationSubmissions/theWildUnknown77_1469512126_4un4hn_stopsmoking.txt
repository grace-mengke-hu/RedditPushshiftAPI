What's your favorite thing about being a non-smoker?

Help! I'm in need of some inspiration!  I've only quit 5 days ago. (2 days longer than ever before!) and I'm finding that focusing on the benefits is helping. Except right now. I am feeling like I want one so bad. 

The best for me is that my chronically swollen right side of my face isn't swollen anymore. I thought I just had a fat face on that side. I think my salivary glands were constantly inflamed or something. My cheek is always tingling too. Like it's coming back to life. 

Yours?

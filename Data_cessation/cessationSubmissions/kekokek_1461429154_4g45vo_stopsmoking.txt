Relapsing is such a great feeling for me

Had a cigarette for the first time last night in 7 days, was immediately disgusted with myself for even smoking it. It didn't feel right in my fingers anymore, I couldn't stand the smell, had no urge to puff it anymore, I put it out.

Relapsing is the best feeling because you realize how disgusting of a habit you once had.

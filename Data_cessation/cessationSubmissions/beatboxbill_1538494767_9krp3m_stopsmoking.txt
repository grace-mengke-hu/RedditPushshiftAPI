The Health Stats on the Smoke Free App

I'm sorry, I don't have a medical license, but I think these stats are bogus.  I'm 4months and 17days smoke-free now, but during that time I've also been eating healthy and exercising.  Quitting smoking has also reduced the amount of drinking I used to indulge in.  With that said, I guess these stats are supposed to be average measurements, but I highly doubt that I'm still at almost the same risk for a heart attack as I was before.  My blood pressure is great, my breathing is great, and so is my wallet ;) ;).  I just feel like these stats are discouraging for those who want to make a difference in their life.  Chime in though if I'm missing something. :)

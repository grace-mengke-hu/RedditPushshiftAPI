Quitting and anxiety?

Hey all! 

So I (36F) have been a steady smoker for about 18 years now. A few years ago, I got on some mental health meds that reduce my general desire to "consume" (i.e. smoke, drink, overeat, etc.) So, I'll stop smoking for a few weeks here and there. A few months ago, I wouldn't smoke for the first half of the week, then just give in by Wednesday night. And because of the meds, I seriously have zero physical cravings without smokes. These days, I don't smoke at all during the day, but after work when I get home...it's like I make up for all that non-smoking time by puffing non-stop. 

I realized this weekend that I'm basically forcing myself to maintain the habit. It's more a mental addiction at this point, rather than it is a physical one. Went out with friends Friday night, stayed up late, drank &amp; smoked a ton. Then on Saturday, I was out of smokes and really didn't care. That evening, I had to get gas and while I was at the gas station, I bought a pack not because I really wanted them but because "Meh, I'll probably want one eventually." And this morning, I was resting my head on my husband's chest (also a smoker) and could hear him wheezing terrribly. It's like a switch flipped. I don't need to knock this off for just my own health, but for his, too.

So I just threw my smokes away this morning. But here's what's bugging me...if I don't think about smoking, I really don't care. But now, if I'm telling myself "Ok, that's seriously it, I'm done" I'm gripped with absolute panic and can't stop thinking about it. (Even though I wouldn't even think twice on a normal work day.) 

Anybody else have a similar experience? Any advice on how to move past the panic/anxiety?

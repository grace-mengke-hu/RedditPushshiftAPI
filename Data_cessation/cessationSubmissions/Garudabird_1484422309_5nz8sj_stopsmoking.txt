Surprised by a friend's actions

I'm an excellent quitter, I've done it so many times!!! I'm feeling really positive this time round but I had a shocking experience with a friend and was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. 
On NYE after the bar had stopped serving drinks, a bunch of us went outside to watch the fireworks. I was with a friend who smokes the occasional cigarette, probably about 4 a year and only when someone else has them. So there was a smoker outside and my friend decided she was going to have one. She asked me if I wanted one too. I seriously contemplated it but know that just one has been my downfall every time so I said no. My friend then took a drag of her cigarette, turned to me, blew her smoke directly into my face and asked if I was sure I didn't want one. I was completely stunned that she would do something so deliberately mean. 
In what I believe to be karma however, she was sick as a dog the next day! 
Has anyone else been surprised by the actions of others towards their quitting?

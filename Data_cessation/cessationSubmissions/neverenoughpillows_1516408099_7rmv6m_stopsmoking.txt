52.5 hours....

So I had no intention of quitting this week. Wasn’t on the docket. However, on Wednesday I found out it wasn’t just a cough and the sniffles I had, buuuuut... pneumonia!!!! Yikes. I’ve barely been smoking this week since my lungs feel like they’ve been trampled by a zebra (addiction is a two sided asshole), but then.

But then.

MY MOTHER. Who, offhand, I mentioned maybe I would just try to keep not smoking once I got full use of my respiratory system back. Not thinking much of it.

“You can’t do it”

Record scratch. Narrow my eyes. Excuuuuuuse me?

“You can’t do it. You’re not strong enough.”

It’s blatant manipulation. I know what she’s doing. My mother is ridiculously supportive of my choices, border lining my own personal superfan. She would never put me down like this. Not without an angle.

She knows how I feel about a challenge. She knows I HATE to lose. 

So what’s keeping me from lighting up right now? Picturing her smug face doing an extremely ridiculous “I told you so” dance.

It’s been 58.5 hours. I’m gonna make her choke on them.

How can i quit?

Hi everyone, i'm struggling with quitting

&amp;#x200B;

smoking for over 20 years and tried quitting several times, 

my first attempt was with Zyban 13 years ago,  and it worked, i quit for a year but i started back in a very stressful situation.

my second attempt was with nicotine patch 10 years ago but it didn't work because i had flu like effects with it, i think my body didn't like having nicotine from my arm.

third was 7 years ago, i tried cold turkey, it worked only for 3 days.

fourth was vape replacement, it worked like a charm, i didn't smoke for a year, reduced nicotine levels, but eventually i'm tired of dealing with coil replacement rituals. I also have hesitation about health effects of vape, confusing news about it makes me vary. And started smoking once or twice and then suddenly i was on package again.

Now i have reduced smoking cigarettes  from 1,5 package to 15 cigarettes a day. For last 6 months i'm stable, using an application to track amount of cigarettes, every time i crave i check application, it says " x hours and x seconds since your last cigarette" and i never light a cigarette unless 1:15 hour is past.

&amp;#x200B;

But for the last two months i find it very hard to increase from 1:15 to 2:30 hours break between each cigarette.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think nicotine gum will help?  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like to deal with coil replacement with vape and i am afraid of unknown health effects of vape, but it  can't be worst than cigarettes, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

How about cold turkey?  do you think i can manage?

I just can't understand why the hell i can't just stop lighting a cigarette, it's really weird.

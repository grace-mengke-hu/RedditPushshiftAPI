Day 7(?) everything is not awesome

7 days since I bought my last pack. Less than 24 hours since I caved and bummed a smoke off my ex. 

Today fucking sucked, this last week sucked. I'm tired of flipping between annoyed and apathetic. I'm tired of craving a smoke as soon as I have a second of free time. I don't want to feel pissed off because I'm awake. 

I want this fucking dilemma to end, this rock of being upset all the time and this hard place of knowing that I could just start smoking again and end this misery. 

I'm tired of the self loathing I feel when I realize I'm being such a whiny baby. 

I just needed to write this down somewhere

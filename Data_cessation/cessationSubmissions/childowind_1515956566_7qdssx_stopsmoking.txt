Today is day 500 for me!

And I've never felt better!  I rarely ever get cravings now, and when I do, it's just a passing thought and easily dismissed.  I'm way more active now, joined a gym, lost about 45 lbs, go hiking at least once a week, and never have to make the choice about whether to eat or buy a pack of cigarettes the day before payday.  Actually, I don't really worry about money matters at all anymore.

If I can make it here, I know you can too.  For anyone reading this who might be struggling, I've been there.  I know exactly how you feel.  I was a pack a day smoker for 17 years. My entire adult life and identity were tied up in cigarettes.  Hell, even my default e-mail address makes reference to smoking.  But I changed, and you can too.  There is a light.  You can make it.

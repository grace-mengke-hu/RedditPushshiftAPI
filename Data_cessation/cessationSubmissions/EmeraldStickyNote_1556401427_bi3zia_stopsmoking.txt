I tried the most popular smoking cessation app after seeing it all over social media.

It is not useful for me unless I pay for it. While I have no problem buying a service, it makes me wonder if the developers are advertising by pretending to be quitters. 

My paranoia might also be related to the fact that I havenâ€™t had a cigarette in a while...

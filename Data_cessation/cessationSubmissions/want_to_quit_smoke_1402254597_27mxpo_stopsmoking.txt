Yeahhhhhhh !!! one week of no smoking

I posted a week back about me quitting smoking here. Got some advice from some cool people. Stuck to it and here I am one week without a smoke. I never thought I could do it. First 3 days were the hardest then it started getting better and now I have never felt better before. Stuck to no smoking even through a weekend of boozing .. Yeahhh!!! Thanks to every poster and people who comment here !

I'm 15 years old, and want to quit.

I'm 15 years old and want to quit,  I hate smoking, I hate being scene with a cigarette in my hand, I know how gross and disgusting I must look, and I know if I continue I'm only going to regret it.
I just enjoy smoking so much though, it gives me a couple mins of relief and peace in an otherwise stressful day, it helps me pass the time when I'm at the station waiting for a train everyday. I want to smoke but I don't want to deal with the consequences. I've tried quitting before, I've never really felt withdrawal symptoms, but I get bad cravings, and I miss that feeling of stress relief.

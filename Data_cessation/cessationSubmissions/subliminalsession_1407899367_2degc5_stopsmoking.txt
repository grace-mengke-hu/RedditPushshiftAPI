it feels like i never smoked

i know i could feel totally different tomorrow. but right now, in this present moment, i actually can't imagine what its like to be a smoker anymore, i feel absolutely no urge whatever, after a mere 2 months of cold turkey, following a 20 a day, 5 year addiction, from age 16 to 21, i can't believe it and how good i feel... i honestly feel so much healthier. i can exercise for so much longer, i can still get high without tobacco in the spliff, i can enjoy a hangover without feeling like my lungs and brain and vital organs are collapsing, my skins better, its actually a skin-like colour now instead of grey from tar, i can smell anything, i can taste everything, and i am no longer fighting the urge to leave a situation to go and have a smoke outside every half hour. i can go to coffee shops and sit outside with a latte and watch the world go by and the smell of smoke doesn't comfort/bother me. i don't have to leave my house 20 minutes earlier than i usually would to stop by a shop and get cigarettes and smoke cigarettes. i can't believe it. i watch my friends doing all this things now and i'm flabbergasted that one can be so addicted to something so pointless. I'm never going back. 

i just wanted to share incase anybody needed some inspiration, cause i know personally this sub reddit has saved me from cigarettes/myself so so so many times now. keep going.

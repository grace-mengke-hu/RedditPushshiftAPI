40+ HRs IN

I've smoked for 57yrs. Recent event says I'd better stop or I'll stop. I want a smoke so freak'ing bad. I got 1 all out & an ashtray. I could scream. Think I'll have a cup of coffee & P-butter sandwich then maybe a smoke ........... and maybe not. Hate to wast my 40+ but what to heck...... I could quit again . sorry just rambling

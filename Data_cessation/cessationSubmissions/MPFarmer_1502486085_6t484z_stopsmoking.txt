Four days without a smoke and I had a moment of weakness...

I bought a pack....

Opened it, took out a smoke, held it between my fingers, crushed it, and threw it away. I also crushed the pack, filled it with water, and threw it away. My urge to not smoke beat my urge to smoke. 

 $7 wasted, but I didn't smoke.

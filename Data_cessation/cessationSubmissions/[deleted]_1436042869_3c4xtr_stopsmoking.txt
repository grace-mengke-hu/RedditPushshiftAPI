How can I help my mom stop smoking?

Hi,

Not sure if this post is suited for here or not but I'm pretty desperate so I figured why not.

My mom has smoked for most of her life and has tried to stop smoking for years. She says she has tried everything. Whenever she quits she can maintain for a while but will always go back to smoking after a couple of months. She is having significant physical consequences (vascular disease) as a result of her smoking. However, since the cause of vascular disease is multi factorial she seems to talk her out of the fact that smoking is a contributing factor. I've tried to bring up her smoking in a non accusatory way but she immediately gets defensive. I and the rest of my family are all pretty desperate for her to stop and I really do think she wants to as well. If yall have any advice at all I really would appreciate any help.

Also....I'm a medical student and recovering alcoholic so I sorta of understand both the seriousness of her smoking and really how difficult addiction is.

Thanks

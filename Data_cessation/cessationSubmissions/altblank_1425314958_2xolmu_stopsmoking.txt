missed the 404...

huh. i wanted to post yesterday to brag about 404 days (http 404 is a resource-not-found website message, for those who don't know).

but i forgot, and i'm at 405 days today. http 405 is a method-not-allowed message.

oh, and tomorrow is a 406, not-acceptable :)

i certainly won't check in here for day 417, expectation-failed.

having said that all that, i don't know what this means, but i'm not smoking today (or any day in the foreseeable future, actually).

but really, my daily routine has changed. it's no more "quickly run an 8oz k-cup, run out and have a coffee+smoke", it's now "enjoy the process of making coffee, sit down and catch up on emails, etc."

so many minor changes, all making for a huge lifestyle change.

life's fun.

if any of you happen to be thinking about smoking right now

i just went six days without smoking. caved and bought a pack. i smoked two and honestly, it wasn't that good. it's the only thing that's been on my mind all week and i thought it would feel great but it really didn't.

just wanted to put that out there. they're only cigarettes. i can see now i that i was really just building it up in my head. right now i'm mad at myself and feel weak, like i threw my money away (literally, by throwing a whole pack in the garbage) and broke my streak, all for something i can't even say i enjoyed. i guess on the positive side i am motivated again, but if you're thinking of having a cig right now there's a good chance you're not going to enjoy it as much as you think you are. it's not worth it.

**edit**: thank you all so much for your words of encouragement. first post here, and to anybody who has commented here saying this post stopped them from smoking, i'm glad i was able to help.

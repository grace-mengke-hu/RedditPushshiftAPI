Trying to be wild and free backfired

4months 22days no smoking, it’s funny I started smoking to look cool to say to the world I’m an adult and I hated the smell and taste,  i smoked even though I did not like it until I was addicted to the nicotine. Knowing what I know now that I would smoke and get past the horrible taste and smell for something my body is not craving anymore is crazy I won’t do it! Feeling grateful thank u community

It's only been 3 days but it feels like a month

I don't know why I quit. I don't know why I'm doing this. I don't necessarily want to - but I am. I honestly don't know why i am. The cravings aren't often but when they come they're bad. I'm using an app to keep track of my progress and that little badge saying 3 days feels like such an insult. 3 days sounds so small. I feel like I've been struggling for weeks. It feels like forever ago when I last smoked. But if I say 3 days that doesn't sound like much of an accomplishment. That's almost 100 cigarettes I've resisted. 100 cigarettes I've avoided. 100 cigarettes I haven't smoked. That sounds more impressive than only 3 days - because time is dragging right now.

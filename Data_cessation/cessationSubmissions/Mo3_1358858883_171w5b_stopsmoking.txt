3 days nonsmoker thanks to Cannabis!

Decided to stop smoking again on Saturday after 7 unsuccessful attempts. Whenever I had a craving, I just took another hit from my bong. 

I've done this permanently til today. I'm sober right now (13:45) and there are only some tiny little cravings left, but they're not psychological, it's just this annoying feeling inside. I took some Paracetamol and the cravings disappeared.

Can't believe how easy it was this time.

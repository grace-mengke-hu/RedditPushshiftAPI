For Redditors trying to quit, my app might help to motivate you

Hey all.

I recently built an iOS app that allows users to track progress with images, it was features on Product Hunt here: https://www.producthunt.com/tech/progressr

My friend messaged me last night and suggested it could be used to help people with smoking or alcohol addiction - and that it would be awesome for people to be motivated by the transformation in themselves.

So I just wanted to say, if there are any redditors on this sub that have just started quitting, I have three copies of the app to give away to you for free, comment below if you're interested :) 

Otherwise a free version of the app is also available, links below!

Starting the journey again for a better life.

I've been trying to quit smoking for about 7 months or so. The thought of quitting never leaves my mind, but I have a hard time breaking the habit. I just had my last cigarette about 25 minutes ago and I really want to be done with it this time. I once quit smoking for 2 months, so why wouldn't I be capable of doing that again? I've been struggling real hard for the last 2 months or so. I tried Allen Carr's way and it didn't really work. I haven't been able to get past 6 or 5 days but I feel like the time has come. I need to stop blaming others and accept my daily dose of stress as a natural factor of life.

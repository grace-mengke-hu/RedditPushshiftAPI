Tomorrow is 200 days.

Tomorrow is 200 days since I've had a cigarette. I am 39 years old and started smoking in my late teens.   I made a decision that I could either have my love of smoking, or my love of everything else in the world. Please stop smoking, it gets much easier as time goes by and life is so very beautiful. Best wishes.

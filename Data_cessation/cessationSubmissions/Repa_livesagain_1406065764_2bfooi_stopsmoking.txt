What's Your reason? Best thing about Quitting?

This has been one of the best and most supportive communities on reddit and I'd like to throw out an idea.

 I'd like to know why you quit: Personal health, Job, Family etc.

What is the best thing you have noticed about quitting?

What was most difficult/unexpected?

I'd like to take these and put together the data into a google doc or something and then be able to share it with the community.

Thanks! I wouldn't be two and a half weeks in without you guys!!

That smell...

That toxic chemical smell that isn't rich and sweet like it used to be when I was constantly around it. Most of my friends smoke or suck on those retarded e-cigarettes (don't just tease yourself, even if they are better for you, you're still addicted to nicotine which is the worst of the symptoms). My SO tried quitting with me and lasted a week and a half. I was 6 weeks quit before she smoked in front of me and she doesn't smoke in her car anymore because she's great and she showers before being close to me if she can. Am I an asshole for pointing out she stinks quite often though?

How do people here deal with being around SO's who smoke?

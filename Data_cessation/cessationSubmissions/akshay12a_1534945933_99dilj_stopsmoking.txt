20 days in, Looking for some advice.

So, it's been 20 days+ according to my smoke free app, that I haven't touched a cigarette. The quitting part after the first 3 days felt rather simple. I have mild urges now and again but they aren't strong, or I've grown to easily ignore them. I am however having some issues, and would like some advice/anecdotes on/about them:

1) It's been 20 days, and I still find myself out of breath. I've been upping the intensity in the gym to see how far I can push myself. And the results have been pretty abysmal still, especially compared to my non-smoking days.

How long does it take to recover? Weeks? Months? Do you have any experiences or tricks you use. I love working out and cardio as well. I would feel pretty bad if things wouldn't get better in the latter. :/

2) This might be due to the changing of the season, and Allergies but in the past week, I've developed a strong--occasionally steely--cough. Where I keep having to spit out phlegm. Sometimes yellow, and sometimes white. 

3) Tightness in the chest. Okay this one might sound weird but my chest/lungs feel like they've grown smaller? Like I can't breathe as deeply without feeling tightness in my chest.

And the left side of the chest feels particularly tight.

4) Just general breathlessness as well. Sometimes it gets bad enough that I need an Asthalin inhaler.

Anyway, I got myself checked as well. The doctor said it might be Allergies and told me to get Blood work and some scans done after 8 days on the medicine he suggested.

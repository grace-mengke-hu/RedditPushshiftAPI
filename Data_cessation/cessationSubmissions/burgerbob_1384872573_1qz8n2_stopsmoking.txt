Help! Encouragement and advice needed!!

I'm on day 5 now and am very happy about my progress... but I am struggling with anxiety, I'm incredibly irritable, snappy and really not fun person to be around right now!  I'm taking the Chantix and the cravings are not an issue, it's just my mood!!  I feel like I'm going through a roid rage episode or something!!  I'm angry inside and it's boiling over on the outside!!  My GF doesn't even want to talk to me or be around me at all.  I have been a mess!!  Anyone have any helpful suggestions to ease the anxiety?  
I'm very happy that I've chosen to stop, I just didn't think, nor do I remember ever getting this irritable!!  Thanks!

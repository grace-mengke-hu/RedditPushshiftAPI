time to stop

29/M started with mixing tobacco and weed 7 months ago, then I just kind of gradually bummed cigs till I bought my own. Pretty bad that I never officially quit after many attempts that lasted 1-5 days. 4 days ago I bought a vape pen instead, which is zounds healthier but... I suck through them so fast, I'm now consuming 2.5x the nicotine I was before. Pretty stupid. And they're crazy expensive. So anyway, just ran out, here I go, to infinity!

Two weeks

Wow, two weeks felt like forever but I did it. Working on replacing habits and understanding the underpinnings of this addiction in a personal and wider level. I still feel very tired, head ache, and achey, and sometimes get strong cravings. However I if I follow a craving through to smoking I know I don't want to go back. I feel more free and more capable of handling my life without them. Not to mention excited about my body healing and feeling better.

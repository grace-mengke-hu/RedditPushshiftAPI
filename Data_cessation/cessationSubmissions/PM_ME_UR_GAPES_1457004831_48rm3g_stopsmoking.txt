Making progress but still a long way to go

So I just replied to a thread in /r/showerthoughts and realised my comment would make a decent post here...

I'm only 28 and I hate my life so badly because of smoking.  I started when I was 12 and have been pretty much a chain smoker for the past 10 years.

I hate waking up and looking at myself in the mirror.  I've destroyed my appearance - my skin is broken, damaged, wrinkling, with dark shadows around my eyes.  I always have a nasty cough and get tired very quickly.  I've remained stupidly skinny and underweight.

I'm terrified of going to the doctor despite friends and family recommending it - I cough out blood regularly, get ill very quickly and if I ever get cut then my blood comes out thick and gooey.

Well, that was my life until about 6 months ago.  For some reason I woke up one morning and after the daily dose of self-loathing I get from looking in the mirror, I actually decided to do something about it.

It's not been smooth, it's not been easy and it's not been particularly enjoyable or 100% effective so far.  I've tried stopping cold turkey, reading self-help books, trying vapes and champix but the cravings and the temptation still remains.

After the relapses, struggles and constant battling I'm now in a position where:

* I no longer buy cigarettes regularly.  Last time I bought a pack was 2 weeks ago - I smoked 4 over 3 days and then threw the rest away
* I still have the odd cigarette but I still see it as huge process for someone who was doing close to 40 a day for 10 years
* I use an ecig regularly and even after starting at 18mg I'm now 0mg.  When I try anything with nicotine I can notice the nasty taste of it, and end up going back to the 0 which is far more enjoyable.
* I do basic workouts and exercise and can feel my stamina improving
* Looks-wise, I don't think anything has improved, but then again it hasn't gotten any worse.  I do try to take a selfie everyday so I can look back and see if there are improvements - but there aren't any so far and I guess that could be down to the fact that I still smoke no matter how infrequently
* I have an app to monitor my progress - my longest streak without a cig is 16 days.  When I do relapse it's usually just one which serves as a reminder of how disgusting smoking is

I hope that I can kick the habit once and for all.  I don't want to be dependent on that, or e-cigs or any other form of crutch.  I want to enjoy my life, do sports, be healthy and live a better life than I have been doing the past 10 years.

It's a slow journey but I believe that I'll get there.  I really don't want to die of lung cancer or any other smoking relating illness.  Realistically I know it might already be too late for that, but at the end of the day I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain so I'm going to keep fighting.

Fuck it I give up

I'm so tired of the tactics my addicted brain uses to keep the nicotine coming in. The bargaining, the denial, the delaying... It's too much. I quit cold turkey for four months last year without much trouble. Then smoked "just one" on new years. Back up to a pack a day. For over half a year now I've thought about quitting literally every single day. I'm tired of waiting for the "right time," tired of scheming over cutdown plans, tired of everything. 

I've been smoking for ten years. I'm broke as a joke. I have HIV. I need to quit. And it is never going to happen if I don't do it right this instant.

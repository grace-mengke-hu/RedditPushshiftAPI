First day...

Hey everyone. My names Mark and I’m 25, been smoking for 7/8 years and taking the plunge for the sake of my son and newborn daughter. 

No doubt it’s gonna be hard but hoping I’ve found a little community of people that can help me stay motivated and in turn, maybe I can help some people too. I’d like to hear some stories about your journey so far &amp; motivation to quit if you’re willing to share. Here’s to being smoke free 🍺

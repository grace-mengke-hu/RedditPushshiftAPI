Stopped smoking three weeks ago

I am now in the fourth week, in which I am not smoking. Works okay, but I have one problem: I have smoked with some small interruptions  25 years. These interruptions are somehow a problem now. I stopped smoking already at one time for one year, another time for one and a half year, another time for six month. There were different (silly) reasons there for starting again. My problem now is, that I do not believe I will stop for all time. "A voice" somehow tells me: good that you stopped, but, you know it, in one year you will smoke again... Do you have any ideas, how I should "handle" these thoughts?

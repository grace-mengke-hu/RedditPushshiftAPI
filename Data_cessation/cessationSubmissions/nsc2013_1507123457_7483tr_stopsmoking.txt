Day 3

I am currently on Day 3 of quitting. The entire time I've had no cravings. I only smoked for three years so could it be just that? The only thing that bothers me is that my throat is sore and it can be difficult to swallow. I've read that that's normal as my body is healing from the damage of smoking, but does anyone know how long this will last?

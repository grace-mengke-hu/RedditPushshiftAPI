End of an Era

Hi all, apologies for what will probably be a long and occasionally rambling read. Basically, I was wondering what, if any, deeper changes occurred as a result of your decision to quit, after a few months or a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of preface: I'm currently 29, and had smoked for about 10 years (half a pack to a pack a day) before quitting almost 3 months ago. This is my second quit this year, the previous one lasting 40 days before a drunken night at a bar sent me down a slippery slope I'm sure many of you can relate with. I quit for the obvious reasons of health and a desire to 'take control' and end what I perceived to be slavery to cigarettes. At the time of my quit, I was pumped from Allen Carr's book, was fully convinced of my reasons for quitting, and breezed through the first few weeks. The benefits were not long in coming: my favorite one was how much easier it was to get out of bed in the morning. I was quite happy and rightfully proud of what I had done. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few months since then, though, and unlike for some of you, whom I quite envy, actually, it feels like the novelty of quitting has gone away. I'm in no way trying to say quitting is not the correct thing to do, but it's almost as if nostalgia is creeping in, eliminating all the unpleasant memories and feelings of worthlessness and leaving me with only the good memories, those few pleasant cigarettes we remember fondly. With the novelty gone, then, but with life continuing on, stresses and everything, and with only the pleasant memories remaining, I've been feeling strong urges recently to pick up a smoke. It's also worth mentioning I live in China, where cigarettes are cheap and smoking is very commonplace.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got introspective, as I am wont to do, and it occurred to me that simply removing the negative habit might not be enough to feel that freedom that I thought I would. It just so happens that I've been thinking about other big changes in my life recently, most notably being the fact that I'm in a long-term relationship and the end of my partying days. It's also difficult to replace them: Carr might say they're just nicotine delivery devices, and I understand why he says that, but recently I've been thinking they actually did have other functions. Again, not in the least worth the damage to one's health but it might not be so productive to deny them. I exercised regularly prior to quitting and still do so, but while it's great and all, I can't exactly take a 10-minute break at work to run a mile or blast out a set of squats. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my question(s), for those of you who have gone several months, or several years. Did you experience something similar to this? How did you push through? Did you replace cigarettes in whatever function they fulfilled for you? Did you find you had to make other significant changes in your life as a result of having done this? How long was it before you got rid of the brainwashing, the irrational thoughts that cigarettes will somehow make life easier or better?

Thanks for reading, and truthfully I just need a bit of support. I'm sure a lot of you can attest that non-smokers, for all their good intentions, can't actually understand what this is like, and smokers don't really want to hear it. This place has been helpful to me, and I'm grateful to you all for that. Incidentally, I have a work conference in Thailand next week; I've been kind of dreading it as it feels like it'll be a high-stress environment for me, but also looking forward to it as it feels a bit like a final exam, or boss fight, after which I'll have accomplished 3 months. I'll definitely be checking in, good luck to all of you!

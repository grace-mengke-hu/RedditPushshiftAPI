I Can Breath!

Isn't it awesome to be able to take deep clean breaths? I used to LOVE smoking. I'm almost 50 days in, and I'm not forgetting I'm still addicted to smoking. I'm just reminding myself how I felt before I quit. I never thought I could quit. But I did. I struggled for the first couple weeks. I still struggle. I just keep reminding myself of the coughing, wheezing, the fact my husband wouldn't even kiss me, the smell, the worry of getting lung cancer, not being able to breath. You can do it people! Do it for yourself! It's the best gift you can ever give yourself.

Are these typical withdrawal symptoms or am I being melodramatic?

Been smoking since I was 14. I'm 20 now and had my last cigarette 4 days ago. 

I am a fucking wreck right now. My thoughts are cloudy and I have been crying a lot (usually only cry once in a blue moon) and I am truly convinced that I have no real friends and have accomplished nothing in the time since I started smoking that was not aided in some way by nicotine.

I know that quitting is hard, but I feel like some of the behaviors above are not actual withdrawal symptoms. What were you like within the first few days of quitting? Does it sound to you like my "withdrawal" is psychosomatic?

The Relationship between Caffeine intake and Nicotine Withdrawal Intensity

First off, let me report my experiences.   I am a 14 year smoker.  Ex Smoker now.  I have tried to quit multiple times every year for the past 12 years.  Most of the time I do not get past 12-14 hours before I am sneaking off to the gas station like a junkie.  A few years ago, I tried to quit.  In order to work up to quitting nicotine, I tried to quit something less daunting.  I quit caffeine.  

When I finally quit smoking, I noticed something very interesting with my withdrawals.  They were considerably less intense, and for a shorter period of time.  It was a lot easier for me to power through.  I ended up smoking again, however, that was less do to cravings and more due to the fact that I just like smoking.  I still do.

Well, I repeated this experiment a few days ago with the same results.  I had a pretty rough first day, but after that, my nicotine withdrawals were basically nothing.  

Anybody have a similar experience?  I seriously feel like I just cheated or something.  It was that much easier for me.  The real challenge going forward is dealing with the fact that I just miss the smoking experience.  I do like that I am already starting to feel a little better, and its nice to not feel like a slave to something that will kill me.  Hopefully, it will stick this time.

I would love it if people who are struggling to get through the first few days of quitting cold turkey would try this, and report their results on this thread.  This is not exactly a real study, and quantifying the intensity of your own withdrawals will be highly biased to your own personal views, but maybe there is something here.  Caffeine and smoking go so well together, that I wonder if the habits reinforce each other?

Three days in...

Three days in, and I've almost caved in to the urges many many times. 

Just gotten some expensive pills from my doctor which help me stop, too. 

I'm surprised that I've never heard of these pills before hand, they are named Champix. They work by blocking the receptors in your brain that respond to nicotine. I have a two week amount of them at the moment. Let's pray that they work.

Good luck to everyone else who isn't as fortunate to have an awesome doctor like myself.

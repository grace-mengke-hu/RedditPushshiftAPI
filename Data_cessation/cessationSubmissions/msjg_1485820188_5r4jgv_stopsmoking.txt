1 week + 2 days: I *really* picked the wrong week to stop smoking

I'm 55 years old, and I started smoking when I was 13. I quit when I was pregnant with my son 31 years ago. Started back up when he was 2. Quit again a few years later for another couple of years, then restarted during a stressful time and I've smoked non-stop since. 

Almost 10 days ago I finally got fed up. I was figuring out my finances and realized how much I was spending on tobacco. I'm in the lower income bracket, and I realized I was actually sitting there deciding to forego food in order to buy cigarettes. I mentally bitch-slapped myself for that idiocy, and decided to quit. For good.

Then this past week happened. I've been so stressed out and angry over the political goings on in my country, and then combine that with the physical and psychological withdrawals - well, I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. I'm using a VUSE as my temporary nicotine replacement, and have cut down to just a few inhales a day, but still. I'm having a hard time. 

My son told me to turn off the news and watch Netflix for a couple of days. I think he may be right. I'm also back to work tomorrow after a couple of days off, and I think that will help too.

Thanks for reading.

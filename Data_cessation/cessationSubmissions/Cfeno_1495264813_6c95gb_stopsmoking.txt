What it's all about....

Today I'm off to New York on holidays with my parents. A bucket list trip for them which I agreed to bring them on about 6 months ago. They hated me smoking so I decided to quit in time for our trip. It's amazing to be able to do this. And for once I didn't have to wait until the very last minute before clearing security so that I could smoke my brains out, nor am I dreading the next 8 hours on a plane! Fantastic feeling that I never thought possible. Just some positivity for anyone struggling this Saturday morning!

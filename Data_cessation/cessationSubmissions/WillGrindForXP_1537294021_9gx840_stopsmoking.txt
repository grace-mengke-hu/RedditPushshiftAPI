Your experiences with Nicotine Patches.

Just started using them today. They itch quite a bit - is that normal?   


Mine also seem to come off after about an hour, there seems to be a wet layer just under the patch causing it to come off. Again is this normal? Is this a build up of the nicotine or is my arm having a very small and localized sweating session under the patch?   


i'm also trying to work out nicotine levels that my body is used too. Does anyone know roughly how much nicotine is in a roll up cig?   


Thanks guys, this is super horrible.

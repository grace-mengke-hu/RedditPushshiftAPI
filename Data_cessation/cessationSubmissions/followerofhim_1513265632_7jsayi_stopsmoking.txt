About to quit - quit already

Hi folks,
I smoke for almost 15 years ever since I was a teen, and smoke a pack-a-day. 
I got a pack full in my pocket and another in my bag, but as I just came back from lunch and went up in the elevator the woman near me seemed umcomfortable and when I left I heard her complaining *"something... cigarette"*. 

So, I realized with some clarity that I seem to stink (I already knew that but didn't know it was that bad). I don't want to stink, this is the thing that bothers me the most about my habit. 

There is no easy way to go about this but I will be trying to go cold turkey as of now. I do have some nicotine gum here that someone gave to me and I will chew on it when the craving becomes too much. I might also use some snuff that I got. 

So I'm just writing this here for accountability and to ask that you wish me good luck. I don't know if I will last through the day but I sure hope I can . Cheers and so help me God.

I'm going to stop smoking right now.

I was just sitting here thinking to myself about how I need to stop smoking. I don't know what made me think about it. Maybe it's the fact that I've been thinking about going outside and having a smoke all night, but I never got up and did it. For the record, I do use an e-cig, and I do vape it near constantly, but I haven't been using it to quit smoking. I just use it to get my nic fix when I'm still inside, for the most part.

But I kind of got thinking, "if I'm not quitting right now, when am I ever going to quit?" I've told myself I'm going to cut back, and I've been putting it off forever. I've told myself I'm going to quit one day, but I haven't actually stopped. So why not today?

I think I'm going to really do it. There are plenty of people who have quit cold turkey, and I have to hand it to you - that's really impressive and must be pretty hard to do, because I don't know if I could do that - but I'm going to use my vape whenever I have cravings for a smoke. I'm not doing this anymore and I'm going to quit while I'm relatively ahead. It's been 5 years of smoking, but fuck that shit. I'm done. I want to be able to smell and taste and breathe right again. I want to be able to tell my girlfriend I'm not a smoker anymore. I want to actually do this and I want to know that I can do it.

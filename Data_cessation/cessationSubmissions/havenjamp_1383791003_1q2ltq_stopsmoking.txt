Question for you long time quitters that workout

I quit last dec, after 15 years. This last year I decided I wanted to get in shape. So I started going to the gym. I even did a round of insanity during the summer. I even started running. Plus, I quit taking the elevator and was able to run up 3-4 flights of stairs and not really be that winded. 

As of lately,  I've noticed I'm having difficulty catching my breath during interval workouts or intense stretches. Even going up the same set of stairs is making me feel like I'm a smoker all over again.

Anyway, off to what I'm getting at...has anyone else experienced this happening? It feels like my breathing was getting better, but now it feels like it's getting worse.

Thanks in advance for responses.

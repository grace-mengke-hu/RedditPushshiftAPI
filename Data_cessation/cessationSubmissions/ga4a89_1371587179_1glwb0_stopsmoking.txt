I haven't been posting here for a while. Let me break it to you nicely but...

... I'm glad I forgot about you :) 
 Living non-smoker lifestyle 100%. You've helped me a lot. Reading about your success inspired me.  Reading about failures made me realise that I can do better.  You know, set some new goals.


Anyway, love you all (no homo)

 Thank you :)

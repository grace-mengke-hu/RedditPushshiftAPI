Almost 8 weeks in and being put to the test!

I started using patches 21mg and nicotine gum 4mg several pieces a day. After 2 weeks I stepped down to 14mg patches and 2mg gum. Then for 2 weeks I used only 7mg patches. The last 2 weeks I haven't used anything and its getting easier. But I have some family in town and they all smoke they are staying with me and it is hard! Staying strong tho. Keep it up quitters.

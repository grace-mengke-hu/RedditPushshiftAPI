65 days smoke free! Thank you to everyone on this sub for the inspiration

Been smoking for 6 and a half years, a pack a day at one point, but hovered around half a pack or more for the most of it. I'm living in a country where cigarettes are less than a buck a pack which has made quitting super difficult.

BUT, this is officially the longest I haven't smoked in the past ~7 years. I've been lurking here daily to help me, and all the stories and encouragement are what's helped this quit be successful. Thank you /r/stopsmoking ! And to anyone just starting out, it gets easier. Like, a lot easier. The beginning sucked, but now I go days without experiencing a single craving.

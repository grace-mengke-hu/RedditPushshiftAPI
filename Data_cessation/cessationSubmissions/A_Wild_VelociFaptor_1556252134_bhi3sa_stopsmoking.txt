It's now been over a day since my last smoke and I feel great! My life feels marginally more uplift.

If anyone's interested: _My_ trick was to just get away from smokers. My mum is out of town and I've become distant with my friend (unrelated) so I just _forced_ myself to stop and laziness made sure I didn't buy any.

havent had a smoke since december, but i feel like i am losing my mind

i have adhd and some small anger issues, anxiety(the real kind), smoking was always my medication for this (i will not take adhd medication, do not like how it makes me feel) 

now at this point the nicotine should be effectively washed out of my system and my brain should have had enough time to reconfigure. but i just cant get right in the head, i have begun to notice the symptoms of depression creeping up, nothing makes me happy anymore. i cant enjoy my hobbies anymore, i just want to be alone and sleep 24/7. 

as for responses, just answer me this: is it better to be happy or healthy? only pick one

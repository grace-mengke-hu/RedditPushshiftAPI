Day 3: having few issues.

My sleep schedule is out of whack, I'm having trouble staying up, and when I leave my house I check my pockets, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something because my front right pocket is empty (where I usually keep my cigarettes).

Honestly this isn't what I thought it would be, I thought going from a pack a day and stopping cold turkey would leave me lying awake at night craving nicotine. but I'm barely even thinking about cigarettes.


what was the hardest time for you guys when you quit? was it the first week or was it later?

What am I doing wrong?

I smoked for 20 years ~12 cigs per day. 
I tried to stop a few times. This is my longest smoke free period ever. After a month it got easier and easier but now I suddenly find myself craving like hell. WTF?!? 

First I thought oh cool the dying breath of a old habit triggered by a little stress. But it goes on for a few days now and my resolve is getting weaker. I miss sitting on the window looking at the smoke going skyward and disengaging from the world. I tried tea at the window and incense sticks, but it isn't the same and there is no reason for the window sitting. I feel this happy smoking fantasy image getting stronger and my rationally convincing reasons to stop getting weaker. Help!

Dumped and decided to quit

It was always a sticking point with her. Her mother had died of lung cancer a few years back, which was caused by 20-odd years of smoking. Last month she dumped me, and although I never really got a reason, I believe that it was because I never showed progress or the desire to quit. 

Fast-forward to this past Monday night and I had just ran out of cigarettes. I was mentally trying to figure out how I could pick up a pack on the way home so I could have a pack ready for Tuesday morning ... when I suddenly asked myself "what the fuck am I doing?" I've lost my girlfriend, I've lost untold amounts of money, I'm destroying almost every part of my body, and I'm obsessing about these things!! 

I've smoked a pack a day since I was 18 (almost 9 years now) and this would be my 6th time trying to quit. I'm going cold turkey. 2 days, 14 hours in and I've got headaches, the shakes, and I'm hungry all the time - but I know this is what needs to happen. I know that the need I have to cure myself of this terrible affliction is greater than my need to smoke, and that's what I'm banking on. Wish me luck!

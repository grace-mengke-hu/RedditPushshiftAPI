Am I not addicted?

I picked up smoking cigarettes around October of last year. I've smoked about half a pack to a pack (closer to a pack) a day since then all up to this May. Then after graduating college, I decided to go on a '2 month cleanse' where I don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or do drugs, just to see if my life is enhanced significantly that way or not. 

I stopped smoking Saturday night of last week, and it's Sunday night right now.  It's been a week. I haven't felt anger, frustration or "withdrawals". However I did crave a cigarette badly mid-week when I was having a rough day. I do mentally crave a cigarette and the nice feelings I got from it every now and then, but I don't feel any withdrawals. 

Does that mean I was not addicted? My father has smoked since he was 30 and he smokes about 2 to 3 packs a day. Says doctors say his health is just fine. Wondering if some people have better tolerance to tobacco/nicotine.

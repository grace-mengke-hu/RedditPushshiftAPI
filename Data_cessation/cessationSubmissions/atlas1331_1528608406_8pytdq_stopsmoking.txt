Should I restart the number of days?

Hey guys- so I was at my best friend’s wedding tonight, and after so many months of not even thinking about smoking, I got really drunk ( am still as I post this), and ended up taking one drag off of someone else’s cigarette. It was disgusting, and now I know I don’t even kind of want to smoke at all. After that one time, though I’d hang out with friends while they were smoking, I didn’t smoke at all nor did I have any desire to smoke at all. Should I start my count again? I feel like now I know I’m not missing a damn thing, and I don’t have any desire to ever do that again ( seriously... I felt like i was going to throw up). Am I a bad perso because of this?

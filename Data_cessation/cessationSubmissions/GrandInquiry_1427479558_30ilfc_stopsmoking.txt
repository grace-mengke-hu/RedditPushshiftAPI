Trying to quit smoking with NRT - 3rd time

Hi all - Just wanted to share my quick story since others have been so generous sharing theirs and helping others.  I have been smoking for the last 3 years and peaked at around a pack a day.  The first time I tried quitting I developed the typical smokers cough.  It was terrible, I would go into coughing fits sometimes for several minutes at a time and they would happen suddenly several times a day, typically in the morning or in the middle of the night.  

I ended up trying to smoke a few a day to wean myself off slower and and reduce the cough.  Naturally I ended up smoking again but peaked at about a 1/2 a pack a day where I was until Monday.  I did try to quit again last fall and went I think 2 days without smoking.  I basically lied to myself and said I've gone a couple days, surely I could go back to just 2 or 3 a day then quit.

On Monday, I cut back to about 4-5 per day and use nicotine gum to replace the others.  The good news is that the cigarettes are starting to taste pretty gross.  But the bad news is how difficult it is for me to give up these last 4 per day - which are all my favorite ones.  The first one in the morning, mid-morning at work, mid-afternoon, and when I head home.  I notice if I can skip that very first one, the rest of the day is easier, but I really really love that first one... I assume it's only because of the withdrawal kicking in at that point.

Anyways, I feel more motivated than ever to quit and appreciate everything you all have shared on here.

Wish me luck!

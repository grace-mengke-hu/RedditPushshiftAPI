I wanna smoke so badly!

So I made it a whole month not smoking. Itâ€™s so hard because I work in a bar where I can legit smoke behind the bar working. Classy I know. This was a perk of mine to work there. I loved it.
Anyway, I have to write two papers today that I have been procrastinating on so I caved and took a vyvanse. I want to smoke soooooo bad. This pill has me full turnt and ready to smoke but I will not do it!

I will not smoke with you today! Or drink!

"but I'm not a smoker" I say as I smoke my sixth that day "for the company"

And why not smoke a cig as I wait for the bus? I'm not a smoker so one won't kill me.

Why not go sit outside in the sun with a cigarette? I'm not a smoker so I'm allowed 

Why not have one with the coffee? Coffee and cigarettes go together so well, and I'm not a smoker so it's not like I'll get cancer 

It's only one right? 

Anyway, I have been a "non-smoker" for so long now that I have a minimum of 4 hygge-smokes a day, steadily increasing. I decided to quit last week. Lasted 5 hours. Then I tried again and lasted three days. I slipped up yesterday and that's the last time. I have been in denial for a while now but it turns out I'm a smoker, and I do not want to have to admit to that. 

R/stopdrinking was a godsend for me, so here we go I guess?

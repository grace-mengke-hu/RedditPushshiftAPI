Terrified of Failing

This isn't my first attempt at quitting.  I am scared to tell anyone I am trying to quit because I don't want to disappoint them if I fail.  I'm scared this is going to be one more failed quitting attempt to add to my history.  I really want to stick with it, but I have very little willpower.  Thinking that I will NEVER have a cigarette again is terrifying! What do I do on my breaks at work?  What do I do while I'm driving?  All these little spaces of time have been filled with smoking.  I don't like change, but I know I need to make this change.

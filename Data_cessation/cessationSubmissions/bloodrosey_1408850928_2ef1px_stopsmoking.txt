Update: Postpartum Depression and Quitting Smoking

A couple of days ago, I posted about how bad my postpartum depression was and how hard it was making quitting.  I was downright suicidal and couldn't see the end of the depression.  Wanted to update anyone who was interested.

Guys, I think quitting actually made the depression less bad.  I still get weepy a bit but that is normal hormones and not scary.  I think the mini-withdrawals that smokers go through were actually intensifying the depression and anxiety.  

This may have been the best time ever to quit smoking. I can feel how much better I am.  I still have occasional cravings but I find a walk outdoors really helps.  When my body heals up a bit more, I'm gonna start doing push-ups during the cravings (gotta get those arms strong so I can hold the rapidly growing baby anyhow). 

Thanks to all who chimed in and sent PM's.  We can do this.

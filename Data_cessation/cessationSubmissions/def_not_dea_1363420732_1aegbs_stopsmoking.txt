Trying to stop smoking cigarettes. I finally had enough and was looking on reddit for tips when I found this place. Wish me luck.

I have only been smoking for about 6 months. I started (stupidly) out of boredom due to my overnight work schedule.


I am planning on quitting cold turkey, although I will not be quitting weed (I vape that though)

Wish me luck!

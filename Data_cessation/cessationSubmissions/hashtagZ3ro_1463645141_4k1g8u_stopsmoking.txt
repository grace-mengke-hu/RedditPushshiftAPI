Half a year later..

Hello everyone, 
On 11th of November last year I had my last cigarette. Since then I had many opportunities to smoke, was going through some bad times occasionally, but I never even considered lighting one. I know how the things work too well, it wouldn't be the first time I failed. I was coming back to this subreddit from time to time, mostly when I had doubts and needed some guidelines (in the beginning), thanks for that, it's an awesome community:-)

Anyway, here I am, more than half a year nicotine-free. Cravings are long gone but there is **one more thing** left. **Every day**, mostly in the morning, I would remember that I used to smoke, I would **think about cigarettes** for a minute. Most of the time it would end on that, cigarettes wouldn't cross my mind that day anymore but even once is quite annoying. Sometimes, like today, it wouldn't end on that and somehow I'm still questioning why I quit and is it the right thing to do, because I'm thinking about damn cigarettes the whole morning (kind of tricked myself into it). It's not that I need to smoke or that I want to smoke, it's just that I'm constantly reminding myself of smoking and sadly now I only remember the "good" parts of the habit (addiction), I know because this isn't the first time I'm doing this - as I said, I am well aware that addiction is a bitch.

All in all, I'm desperately waiting for a day when I won't even think about cigarettes for a second. Maybe I'm approaching this in a wrong way, maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm going through tough times regarding my college and future at the moment. I would like to hear from some of you, do you have these cigarette flashbacks? Or whatever they're called. How do you deal with them and how to make them stop?

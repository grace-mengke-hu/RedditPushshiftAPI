Juuling vs. Smoking?

I bought a Juul about a month ago -- I've cut down on my cigarette intake significantly since I got it, with my plan being to stop smoking cigarettes completely in the near future. I'd also like to stop using my Juul further down the line to get off of nicotine completely, but I'm just focused on transitioning from smoking to vaping at this current moment.

I know e-cigarettes and vape pens (and thus, Juuls) are relatively new technology and so there are almost no long term scientific studies on their effects. My assumption, and what I've heard anecdotally, is that Juul is still way better for you than smoking cigarettes.

Does anyone here know if that's true? I tried researching online but have mostly met a lot of frustrating articles saying "Juul is an alternative to traditional cigarettes but it also lowers the barrier to entry for young adults to get addicted to nicotine so we as a society should be wary." Obviously Juul makes nicotine more accessible to youths, and I don't support that, but I'm wondering from the perspective of smoking cessation: does anyone know of, or can they point me to, studies that confirm that vaping is healthier than smoking, to help ease my anxieties?

I very much realize that the leading research dictates that, and the mentality of this sub focuses on the fact that, eliminating nicotine from your life completely is the most effective approach, and that all alternatives are just a crutch. If you could all humor me as I work through my journey of quitting though, I would very much appreciate it &lt;3

I can sing again...

It’s been nearly three weeks since I quit cold turkey. I quit because I was sick and couldn’t smoke, then I consciously decided not to any more. I’ve been struggling the last couple days because of stress and I’ve wanted a smoke bad. Today it’s quiet at work, and while listening to a cover of Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, I found myself singing along. I stopped doing that years ago because my voice would crack and I couldn’t reach the high notes any more.  
I used to be a really good singer, like was offered a position in senior AND junior choir while I was in high school (while I was a junior. And not to toot my own horn) then I started smoking and after a while couldn’t sing as well, then not at all.   
Slowly I’m getting my voice back! Might be a small feat to some, but I used to love to sing while at home. Helps me think, and I used to like the sound of my own voice ha.   
Anyway just thought I’d share :)

Oh woe is me!

I got drunk and smoked 17 ciggerettes last night and now I am feeling horrible this morning, my throat feels like It has been rubbed down with sandpaper. 

I so want to give up these little bastards, I come to the realisation during a hangover of how little I need them, but my foolish brain soon forgets the morning anguish and repeats the process. 

I so want to give up, any advice? How can I enjoy a drink without a gasper? Help meh!

Age 24. 10 years smoking, pack a day. This is how I feel.

I’ve decided to quit once and for all. 

It’s been 10 hours and my mind is playing tricks on me already. I feel weak against my own brain, it’s a constant ‘ah just get up and get one’ vs. ‘wtf are u thinking bro?!’ discussion in my head. 

The worst part is that I’m on holiday atm, in 2 days I’m flying back home, to work, friends and routine... for me routine has been smoking weed daily for the past 6 years and I liked to mix my j’s with baccys. 

Saying no to cigs is saying no to breathing that shit while playing video games, my morning coffee and cig, my goodnight joint, my work smoking breaks. It’s a whole new routine and feels like a whole new life to me. I’m scared. 

It’s going to be tough, but I’m determined to make it this time, because I’m tired of running out of breath at this young age after 10 stairs. Because Im tired of justifying not doing sports and locking myself in the apartment just smoking and looking at screens. Because my mum smoked for least 40 years now and I don’t want it to get so internalized as it is with her now. Because my gf doesn’t kiss me when I smell like smoke. Because every time I step out to smoke I miss out on cool moments with the people I’m hanging out with. 

For what?? For giving myself another dose of death? Fuck that. Seriously I’m over with this shit. I’m a strong person. I have control over my own body. My own brain. At the end of the day I’m my own boss and I’m not gonna let anything get on my way to what i want. 

I want to gain weight, do sports, be healthy, smell good, have a nice clean smile, save money. And I want all those things not just now, but also when I’m 60, 70. And not die because I was too foul to make this decision. 

I’m not a guy who likes saying this but now I think is the time:

YOLO. Make it worth it.

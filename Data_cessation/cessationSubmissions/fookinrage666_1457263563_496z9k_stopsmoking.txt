Didn't feel like dying after running

So yesterday I had to take a bus and of course I got out of my place a bit too late so I had to run to bus station to make it. I was surprised how easy running felt and how I didn't feel winded out/tired/dying when I made it to bus station. When I used to smoke after running I would gasp for air for another 10 minutes in bus, that's how winded out I would be. 

I was kinda disappointed I didn't feel any improvments after quitting until now, can't believe how just quitting for 2 weeks can change so much, and I only smoked for 4.5 years (although was a weekend smoker before that for a bit).

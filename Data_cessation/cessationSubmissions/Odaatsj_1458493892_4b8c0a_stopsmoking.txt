My Gratitude List at 25 Days Without a Cigarette

I don't smell like cigarettes anymore.  I don't have to worry about hiding the smell all the time.  My car doesn't smell like cigarettes anymore.  I don't feel guilty that I am doing something that could very well result in my kids losing their father at an early age.  I am not afraid that I am doing something which will result in my daughter holding my oxygen tank as we dance at her wedding.  I don't have to hide my smoking anymore.  I don't have to plan how I am going to smoke every time I go out with other people.  I am more social because I don't dodge people due to my smell.  I call people from my car since I can actually close the windows now.  I am not turning down social invitations because it will be too hard to smoke in those situations.  I can smell again.  I sleep better.  I don't feel 20 years older than I actually am.  I can breathe deeply and feel like I am getting a lot of oxygen.  I feel less depressed.  I am spending more time with my kids because I am not outside all of the time smoking, and I actually take them in the car on errands.  I have more hope.

20 days, longest time I've ever gone, just wanted to say thanks to you guys!

I've never posted here but I lurk alot and read the encouraging messages you guys send to each other and it helps me.

Day 3 and 4 were the worst, I felt like shit, but now I'm doing fine. It's getting easier and easier to dismiss the cravings.

I know 20 days is just a small step, but it's the most I've ever done!

How I fell off the wagon after a year and a half.

Resetting my badge.

I was free and clear for well over a year (and finally past the phase where i replace cigarettes with food) And I lost it all.

How?

e-cigs.

I started vaping, because it seems so perfect. Only nicotine (nic-free also available), no co2, no arsenic or any of the other horrible chemicals. So I grabbed a blu kit, which worked great for a few months, until one day I didn't have the $$$ for cartridges. A co-worker offered me a cigarette, which I took "as a one-time thing". A few one-time-things later I got my carts, but it wasn't the same. I'm really angry that I was so foolish, but have been smoke free for almost a week, and I know I can do it! All I gotta do is not let myself get sucked back in, but for those of you considering e-cigs after successfully quitting, see this as a cautionary tale.

tl;dr always keep your guard up, beware e-cigs (but not in a "they're bad for you" way.)

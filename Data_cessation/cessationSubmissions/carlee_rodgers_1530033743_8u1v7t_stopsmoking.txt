42 and non-smoker

I never post on anything because I have a weird anxiety about talking to strangers on the internet. I just really need to share that I have been able to quit smoking for 11 days. Today is the day after my 42nd bday. I am thrilled to be a non-smoker on my 42nd birthday. I don’t really talk to friends and family about it because I was trying really hard to hide the terrible habit from everyone I know. I can’t really go around bragging to everyone that I quit because I was pretending that my family and friends didn’t know I was smoking. It took me getting very sick to quit this time, but I really want to stick with it. I have had a very severe case of bronchitis over the last 11 days and I never want to feel this way again. This illness was a wake up call and gave me a glimpse into my future if I don’t quit. I realize it would be a miserable future and I deserve better. Thanks for allowing me to share.  Best of luck to everyone.

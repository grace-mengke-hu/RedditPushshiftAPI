Day 3

Been a pack/day smoker for 15 years. Quit (temporarily) here and there, last time (last year) was for 6 months. Making another run at it, started 3 days ago. Any tips, tricks, etc for reducing anger? I distinctly remember being a complete dick last time, and would prefer not to put folks through that again.

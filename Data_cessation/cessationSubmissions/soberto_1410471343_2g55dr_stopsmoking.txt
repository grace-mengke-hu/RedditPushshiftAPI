Hello, my name is soberto and I am a non-smoker

Hello /r/stopsmoking

I'm soberto and I am now a non-smoker. I'm 31 and smoked since the age of 16 - 15 years of torture.

I've read the Allan Carr book, listened to the audio book, and have just finished watching the video someone on this sub kindly posted a link to.

Below are some notes to self. Thank you for your support

All the very best

I will never smoke another cigarette or consume any more nicotine. This is a vow to myself.

I have decided I am a non-smoker and I will never doubt this decision.

I do not envy smokers - I pity them.

I am not being deprived, smokers are. They are drug addicts and only comfortable while smoking. Smoking gives nothing and takes lives.

Smokers envy non-smokers.

I will enjoy the withdrawal because it is the addiction dying inside me.
I do not want a cigarette - it is the nicotine withdrawal which smokers suffer their entire lives. Non-smokers do not suffer this and I wont suffer it much longer.

There is no such thing as just one cigarette like there is no such thing as just one drink for an alcoholic. I will not revive the addiction.
I will not substitute cigarettes with NRT, food, or anything else.
I am not being deprived of anything.

When I think about smoking I will think about how happy I am to be a non-smoker and rid of the curse of nicotine addiction.

There is nothing to give up and I will never smoke again. I will enjoy my life smoke free.

I didn't enjoy being a smoker and will not smoke and become one again. I will not fall back into the trap.

I am now free and smokers envy me. I will enjoy the rest of my life as a non-smoker

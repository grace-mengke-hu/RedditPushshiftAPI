Slipping up on the first day

I know, *I know*. 

If you slip up and end up with a major cut, rather than a full-on quit, will the withdrawal be easier? I had *25* painful craving pangs in the morning and gave in.

I'm trying to tell myself that it's improvement, even if not complete win, but the cut is giving me withdrawal anyway so I'm not sure how to feel.

Usual: 20/day. 
Pre-quit day: about 10?
Yesterday: 3.
Today: 5 (whoa look at that uprising number!)
Tomorrow (hopefully): 0?

I still haven't bought a pack in 3 days, but I guess I just would like to know that there is progress even in this?

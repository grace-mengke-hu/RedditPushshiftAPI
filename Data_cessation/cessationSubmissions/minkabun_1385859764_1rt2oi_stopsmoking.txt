I'd like to try to quit tomorrow and get a month long head start on my New Years resolution. Tips???

I have tried and failed many, many times. 

I am seeking some sort of guidance. I have posted here a few times and gotten good advice but nothing seems to have sunk in. 

I don't really know how else to find support and several of my friends smoke. My biggest trigger is smoking while I'm driving. 

I really just need a swift kick in the ass and this forum seems like my best option for good advice and tough love from former smokers. 

Thanks in advance.

Quitting Nicotine Gum Is Almost as Hard is Quitting Smoking

I hate to admit it, but I've been relying on the nicotine gum my doctor gave me months ago to get through this. I'm extremely proud of where I've gotten to. I can be around people smoking and my craving isn't entirely bad. However, the past couple of days have been hard. I feel like my self esteem and confidence have been ripped from me. I couldn't understand why and realized I ran out of nicotine gum a couple days ago. Maybe that's the reason? Not entirely sure. This feeling is far more mental than physical and I'm wondering if it's the nicotine from the gum no longer being available to me or if I'm just going through a social rough patch that is affecting my self esteem. 

Has anybody gone through this? 

Edit: my tag needs to be changed to 35 days and not 153. 35 days of god knows how much nicotine gum.

Questions for those who quit by vaping

Pack a day smoker. It's been 2 days since I last smoked. I bought a blue e-cig and I don't miss smoking. The blue e cig isn't that satisfying but I'm so tired of smoking and I'm just glad that I don't have to put patches or chew nico gum to get away from regular cigs. I want to quit because I'm tired of smelling like shit. My teeth has undergone some bad staining over the 5 years of smoking. I'm starting to cough more. I'm having some stomach issues which I'm sure cigs weren't helping. Also, the cost.

Questions: Will vaping help these issues? Teeth? Smell? Cough? Stomach health? Will vaping help save money at all (i spend 10$ a pack)? What do you recommend I buy?

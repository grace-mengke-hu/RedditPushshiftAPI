I need to do this

For the last year I've had quitting nicotine on my mind. I'm currently addicted to it in the form of vaping. I was able to quit for spurts of a month, a few weeks, days etc until school rolled around I tricked myself into saying I need it to have any focus. Well, I've made it through the semester. 

BUT i have 2 finals tomorrow and one on Friday. I'm going to quit tomorrow. I already have As in all my classes and if I can prove to myself that I can get thru my finals without nicotine then I really don't need it. It will be a great test and I'm just so ready to feel that freedom again. Wish me luck and keep it up.

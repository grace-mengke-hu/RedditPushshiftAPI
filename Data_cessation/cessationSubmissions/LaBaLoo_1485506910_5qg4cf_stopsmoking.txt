Four weeks no smoking! Thank you /r/stopsmoking!

Just like the title says:  I am at four weeks no smoking!  

This sub is THE BEST resource, source of inspiration, place of comfort, soother of cravings and urges, and, really, THE BEST support group you could ever ask for!  

Thank you /r/stopsmoking for helping me get here.  I lurked for several months, so I was already getting a lot out of this sub even before I quit smoking on 12-30-2016.  

Stay strong and don't smoke no matter what!

Have read Allen Carr's EasyWay... Second day passed without a cigarette, barely...

So I stopped two months ago, made a post here, then two days in I failed, and in my misery deleted my post. Now I think I've got a better chance, but *no promises*.

The thing is, Allen Carr (RIP) actually made a reply for every situation. Today I was a little stressed (I work for 12 hours a day, in a foreign country where I barely speak the language) and I thought that this attempt will also fail because I **had to have** a cigarette. Then I remembered *his* wise words: "smoking doesn't relieve stress, it just relieves the withdrawal pangs and after a few days these will be gone."

Let's hope I make it. The thing is that this time there is no pressure whatsoever, I could smoke right now and even my GF won't object. But I wanna do it. I wanna stop.

**FOR FUCK'S SAKE I WANNA STOP THIS MADNESS**

Edit: 3 hours and work is over. Then basically the day would be over. Thank you very much everyone your support is invaluable. Much appreciated.

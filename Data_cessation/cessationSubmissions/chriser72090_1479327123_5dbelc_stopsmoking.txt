Today is the day

Hey guys I smoked my last cigarette a couple hours ago. I'm looking for any tips I can get, my delima is that a guy I work with smokes 3 packs a day, we work together all day everyday (construction) so we can smoke anytime.. do you guys have any tips for me to try to avoid smoking anymore.

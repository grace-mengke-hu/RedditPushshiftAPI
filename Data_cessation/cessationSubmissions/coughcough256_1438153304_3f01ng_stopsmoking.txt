Been lurking for awhile and officially quit 31 hours ago.

Just dropping in to say hi. I will be seeing you guys quite a bit for awhile. I guess a bit about me..I live in a country where smokes are about 1USD a pack, and over half the population smokes, but I am done being a negative statistic. I am ready to get my life under control. You guys have been extremely helpful to my success so far and I look forward to supporting you all anyway I can, too.

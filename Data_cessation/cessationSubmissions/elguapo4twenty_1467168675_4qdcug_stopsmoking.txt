Day 3 complete

Iv been running 2-5 miles (5 days a week) pretty regularly for the past 2 months. My logic was to get my body to a place were quiting smoking will only make my daily routine significantly easier. I usually relapse Thursday-Saturdays when drinking with friends, so here I am hoping this admission of weakness will give me more resolve as the weekend approaches. Plus I am getting tired of going through the withdrawels every 2 weeks, so I hope I can accomplish what I know is possible thanks to this group.

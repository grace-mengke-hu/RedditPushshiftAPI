I Need To Quit

I'm 23 years old and have been smoking for 9 years now at about .5-1 pack a day the whole time. I've tried to quit before cold turkey and by weening. Nothing works. The only time I was able to knock it was in basic training for 2 1/2 months (mostly from lack of time to think about it) , but right afterward I bought a pack as soon as I was at the airport home. 

I need help, but even tho king about it causes me to experience the withdraw prematurely; even after a smoke no more than five minutes prior.

I was prompted to post here after I had such an episode after finishing my last cig mid shift at work. I've read some of you guys' posts and I see many who have had success, but also many that are going through hell and that scares the shit outta me. How can I quit...?

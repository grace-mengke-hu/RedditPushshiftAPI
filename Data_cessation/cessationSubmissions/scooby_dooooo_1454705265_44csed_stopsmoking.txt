I don't know how to quit. Help me out.

Been smoking for last 5 years. Never quit it for a day. Because of this I've Yellow teeth, old face, thin hair and fat body.

But, since last one year, my health has been affected really bad. I look way to old and constant coughing. For a couple of months I've been reading about quitting. Read Quit smoking the easy way and lots of post from this sub. But none of these has given me that psychological edge to quit. It's hard to explain why I smoke 20 cigarettes a day. You guys had a reason to smoke, I don't. I just take a cigarette out and smoke it.

I watch YouTube videos, website articles and lots of post from this sub EVERYF**KINGDAY for last couple of months. I feel shit during watching/reading them and decide that I'm gonna quit. And after few minutes I go back to the cigarettes. I just don't know why I do this, it just happens. I know that they are bad for me and afraid of cancer & bad mouth. And that is why I want to quit. For me it's hard to explain this feeling. I haven't been to a doctor or rehab because I know myself. If I don't have the will to quit, then no one else can motivate or help me.

The thing I haven't tried anything to quit. Just plain nothing. I don't know why my mind is not letting me do it. 

I hate myself. Apologies for this rant. Don't where to go.

TL;DR: I feel shit  about smoking and then decide that I'll quit. Few minutes later I smoke.

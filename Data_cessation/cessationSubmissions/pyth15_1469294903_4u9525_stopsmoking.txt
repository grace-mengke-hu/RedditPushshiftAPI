Today is day 1

So I made the call last night to kick them today. I'm 30 years old. Started smoking when I was 12. I've been a pack a day since I was 18 or so. 

I've been down this road a few times over the years. Even managed to kick them for almost 10 months at one point. Though most times I have tried I don't even last a day.

Sitting here now, salivating, having cravings, feeling anxious, nervous. It's funny how the thoughts come in almost intrusively and unbidden. Thinking how enjoyable it would be to sit on the front step and have a smoke. Then realizing it's almost a foreign thought in my head. 

Anyways. Typing that out distracted me long enough to last a craving. So that's nice. Thanks for listening r/stopsmoking

My buddy I started smoking with thirty years ago is dying of cancer. One insight: Quitting smoking means giving up a desire to always stay in control.

I'm grateful for people who post positive motivation stories about quitting smoking. The positive stories are best. This one just happens to be on the negative side. Hopefully with good results too.

My buddy I started smoking with thirty years ago is dying of cancer. I had quit smoking fifteen years ago, but in the last few, I was dumb and fell back into the trap. After a few tries, I am confident I am back on track, but he was never able to quit.

My buddy and I were so much alike. Similar families, similar heritage, all. We both took up smoking regularly at about age 15. It seemed fun while it was a secret, but soon we were regular smokers. We tried quitting together sometimes, never took. It was only when we started our separate families, and saw each other less, that I quit. 

I met up with him again when I heard that his father, also a hard core smoker, had died. Soon after I learned he had cancer. It's been on and off but things are looking pretty bad right now. He will be leaving a wife and three teenage kids. 

He tried quitting several times, never worked. One insight, I think, is that he was much more of a controlling personality than me. Again, much like his dad. In order to give up smoking, I think you need to learn how to give up some control. Recognize you can't always feel in control. Sometimes you feel lousy or scared and nothing can make it feel better. The cigarette is a false friend.

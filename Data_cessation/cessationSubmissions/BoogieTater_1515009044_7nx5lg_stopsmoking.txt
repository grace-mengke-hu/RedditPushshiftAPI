Bad Cravings Lately

Almost to the four month mark and the cravings lately have been insane. I'm sure it's triggered by stress of the holidays and some serious family issues going on, but so far I've held strong. It's getting hard though cause my mind tries to convince me "just have one and you'll be fine" when I know that's probably a lie and I'll full blown be smoking again. 

I guess a lot of it is that illusion that is just use to make me feel good mentally. It was like relief when lighting up and taking a minute to focus on nothing more than sucking a cigarette down. I've even been having dreams where I'm smoking again after all these months.

Just need some more encouragement to stay smoke free I guess. Posting on this awesome sub helps!

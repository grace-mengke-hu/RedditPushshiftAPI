Tips for my dad after quitting smoking

Allright so my dad out of nowhere decided to quit smoking (had a family relative die of lung cancer not too long ago, probably related to that) and i want to help him with tips and ideas of how he can help his body's and lungs' recovery. He was a heavy smoker for about 20 years i think but suprisingly he didn't have a hard time taking it down, his attitude probably helps in that.

Any medicine or every day routine similar to drinking more water to help his recovery? I've read about some kinds of teas, is that BS? Also seen recommended 1-2 spoons of olive oil every morning, what's that all about?

Addiction is strange

I've been smoking since I was like 15 and I'm 37 now.  I actually thought I had this beat a few times, and I guess I pretty much did in the classical definition, but addiction is probably different for all of us.

-I had my wisdom teeth pulled in my late 20's. Couldn't smoke for a week after and this was the only time I actually quit where it was tough - I imagine because I viewed it as something I wanted to do, rather than something I wanted to give up. I was suprised how easy it was, but at the end of the time I went back to smoking...you know - because there was a wedding and a big party that night (always an excuse).  I learned that I could do it from this.

-I quit for 3 months of my own accord.  Don't even remember how I started again, just that I did.  Again, it was easy once I had the momentum past a couple of days.  After I started again here I noticed a pattern for myself - kind of an easy come, easy go sort of thing.  In retrospect, quitting didn't seem like a big deal, so I always figured I could slip back for a night and then do it again. Obviously not the case. 

-I quit for over 2 years.  Went through a pretty amicable breakup with a girl I had been dating for five years and stayed quit...for a month.  And then I found out she was seeing someone else right after - someone she had met right before and I felt like doing something reckless....and I went right back in.

And, that's where I am now, 9 months later.  Still smoking, although I had stopped for periods in-between. I feel like I'm better off in every other way, honestly, I just wish I had never had that feeling of doing something reckless.

I've read EasyWay again and it's not having the same effect really, but I realized something - I've never had bad physical withdrawal symptoms but I can find endless reasons why I should keep going, in Carr's terms - the brainwashing is the problem. I can always convince myself that I can't afford to lose the sleep (this was never even a problem), that tomorrow is a better day, etc.  

And so I type this out. We're all on different roads but we fight the same battle.  And we'll all have to deal with quitting in different ways, but I'm confident I can do it this time, and I'm hopeful that you are too.

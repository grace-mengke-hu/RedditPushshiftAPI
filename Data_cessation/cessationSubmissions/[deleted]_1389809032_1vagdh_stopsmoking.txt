Urge to smoke even though I never have? What the hell causes this?

Back story:  I've never smoked in my life.  I'm 28 years old and married to a non-smoker.

My entire family smokes, though.  2 packs a day each.  I've never had the slightest urge to pick up the habit.  In fact, I really dislike the smell to the point that it sometimes makes me sick to my stomach.

But the last few days have been weird.  I am having these cravings for it.  I'm never around smokers either.  

I'm pretty stressed right now with work, but I've had stressful bouts in my life where I haven't ever had the urge to pick this habit up.

Any ideas?

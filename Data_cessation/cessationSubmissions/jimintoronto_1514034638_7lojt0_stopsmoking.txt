How I slowed down and then quit, by counting how many I smoked per hour.

Where I live the packages are made of cardboard, so you can write on them. I used a ball point pen to count how long it had been from when I last had a smoke. 

I did that for a week  keeping track of my consumption, so I had a baseline to make comparisons with. 

The second week I resolved to only smoke once an hour. By day 3 I could go two hours, and by week 3 it was four hours between smokes. At the end of the month my "time between smokes " was up to 7 or 8 hours , or about 3 a day.

At the beginning of month 2 I stopped completely. And I  haven't smoked in 13 years.

By lowering the amount ingested and extending the time between smokes, I was reducing my intake and extending my smoke free hours per day.

The pen and paper method worked for me as a quick visual reminder of my intake that day. At that time I was a long distance driver, so a normal work day could be up to 18 hours long. Plus I crossed the border from Canada to the US at least once a week, so I could buy cheap smokes at the duty free store at the international bridge. 

It worked for me,

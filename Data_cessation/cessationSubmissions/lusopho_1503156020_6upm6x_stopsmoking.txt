72 Hours have already passed, feel like caving, It's getting worse

Hi All,
Firstly this is the longest I have gone in around 6 Years, I am 22! After kicking some other habits I have decided to make the decision to quit smoking. I've been keeping myself busy through computer games, and watching crap on the internet. I read that the worst withdrawals you get are between 48-72 Hours. What are your experiences? 

I just went out for a pub lunch on my own. All of a sudden I got very anxious/ self conscious when sitting in the pub and talking to the bar man. Which doesn't usually happen. After this when walking home I felt disappointed, almost went and bought some tobacco but I rushed home in-staid and tried to keep my head strong. I have now been having mad craving sever since for the last 2 hours and not sure what to do, unable to concentrate, lost my energy, don't want to socialise, feeling kind of depressed! This is the worse it has been, almost unbearable!

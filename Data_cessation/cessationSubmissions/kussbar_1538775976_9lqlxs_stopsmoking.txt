One-year itch...

First time poster. I smoked for about 5 years and I've been quit for about a year, although my last actual cigarette was probably more like 7-8 months ago. 

Lately, I've been frequently having like, romantic thoughts about smoking. Like missing the sort of person I thought that smoking made me, missing the feeling of a late night cigarette on a city street corner, or a lazy Sunday cigarette in bed. 

I know this is that same immature idolization of smoking as *cool*â„¢ that made me start smoking in the first place, but lately I just can't seem to get these thoughts from popping into my head. Anybody else deal with this?

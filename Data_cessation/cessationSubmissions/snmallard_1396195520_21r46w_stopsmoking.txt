30 hours smoke free. Advice?

I woke up yesterday morning and decided I don't want a cigarette ever again. My boyfriend smoked a few next to me and I wasn't phased by it, they actually smelt worse than they ever have to me. I'm not craving one right now but I'm scared of habits. Like when I get in my car or if I have a glass of wine. I'm heading out soon and I think I'm going to pick up a box of patches. Any advice?

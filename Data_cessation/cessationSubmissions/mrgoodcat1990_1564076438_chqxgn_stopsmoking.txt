Smoking and depression

I smoke because I'm bored when  in work and it's become something to do on breaks , work is souless and sucked dry . So it's something , saying that I've read the Alan carrs and various research on smoking and it only increases boredom , stress etc etc .  But it's become a habit , a habit I need to break , the more bored and stressed I get the more I smoke and eventually causes depression.

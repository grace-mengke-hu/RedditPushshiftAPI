Is everybody happy (Irish accent)

Bonus points for anyone who knows where that quote is from lol
Seriously though, how is everyone so happy that posts. I literally think about ending everything on a daily basis. Everything sucks, I’m in so much pain I don’t know what to do, the heart burn is so severe I think I’m having mini heart attack’s, my foggy brain won’t stop. My stomach hurts so bad that, I feel like that one guy in alien when it popped out of the stomach, or like the creepy Quad scene on Total Recall. And seriously, Day 28 is tomorrow, and I’ve never felt worse. Everyone is so happy for me and I hate everything and everyone. Wish it would go back to normal, well normal for me, sorry, super depressed but would never do anything, just needed to vent. Don’t have anyone to talk to , so even just typing out my frustrations help. Cheers to all of you who are pushing through, this just blows every single second of every single day

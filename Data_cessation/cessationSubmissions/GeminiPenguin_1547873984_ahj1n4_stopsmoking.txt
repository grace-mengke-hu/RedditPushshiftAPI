Day 5 as a quitter. Just some rambling thoughts.

5d and 40 minutes into my quit. (This time. But this time is THE time.) I always promised myself I'd quit by the time I was 30. (My birthday isn't until May so I think I have it.) Yeah, I'm struggling like everyone does at this point. Right now, it's lack of sleep and interrupted sleep. It makes doing a lot of normal things difficult. I've cut back on caffeine. Way back, because I knew from prior experience it could affect sleep during quitting. I'm not giving up. The way I figure it eventually I'll have to get tired enough to sleep a normal amount of time. I work from home (thankfully) so whenever that time comes I'll gladly hit the sack for 10 hours to catch up.

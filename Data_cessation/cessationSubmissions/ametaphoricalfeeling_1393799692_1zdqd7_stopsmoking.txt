Quit for 9 weeks and lungs still sore and achey?

Does anyone have any advice on how I can either relieve the discomfort I'm having (it's mild so I don't feel like I need to see a doctor) or recommend how I can help support my lungs clear? I exercise regularly and have stayed away from any smokey environments.

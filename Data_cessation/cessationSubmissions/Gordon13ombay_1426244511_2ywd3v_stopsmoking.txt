Coming Up on Five Days, Can't Sleep, Feel Like I have a Cold.

Tonight at 7pm I'll hit five days without lighting up. Day 2 was bad, I broke down and got some off brand drug store gum that seems to help, but not for long. Work has actually been easy, but at night I'm having trouble sleeping. The past three months I used an app to try and wind down to 0, but kind of stopped following towards the end and quit cold turkey.

I'm wondering if I should restart the app the again and buy a pack or try an e-cig.

Beginning my second day

I'm in bed again. So I guess that's where i spend my mornings now.  I had a really great 1st day.  I swear I laughed more than usual.  I was worried that I would wake up today and feel differently but I don't.  I'm not going to smoke again and that decision has already been made.  Sometimes I feel like I'm about to go for a cigarette,  but that's not that bad.  I just laugh and don't do it.  I bought the book from the Daily Stoic guys and today's meditation was timely : "We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that only the educated are free."

What app do you use to track your progress?

There are so many apps out there for quitting smoking. Most seem fine, but require additional purchases within the app. Do you have an app that’s completely free (no add ons) that you love, or a paid app that’s worth the money? 
Today’s my quit day! I want to stay motivated.

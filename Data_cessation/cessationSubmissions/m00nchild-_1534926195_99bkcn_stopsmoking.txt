Asking myself what the point is?

I'm almost 2 months smoke free. Would've been 3 months but I had a few tokes a month in. 

I don't need to smoke every day, I've proved that to myself. What bothers me is when I go out and I just want one cigarette. That's it. 

I have willpower. Why can't I be a social smoker? Life is short anyway, I just want to enjoy myself.

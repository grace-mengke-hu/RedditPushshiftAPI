I started this again

So I made this thread yesterday

https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3ceawl/i_dont_want_to_start_this_again/

And I've started again. I woke up in the morning, knew exactly what I was going to do. I was to go to the gas station and buy myself a pack of cigarettes. 

Good news: I went out with friends later and shared a good 1/2 of the pack, I am now without cigarettes. I'm hoping to keep it that way.

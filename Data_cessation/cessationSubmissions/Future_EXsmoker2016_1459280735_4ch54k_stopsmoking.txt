This Has Been The Longest 6.5 Hours Of My Life

I haven't had a cigarette in 6.5 hours....the cravings hasn't been that bad. It's just a constant tug of war with cravings and health although I know this is going to be a rough ride...I have every intention on beating this, I will not let this beat me.....I'm tired of thinking my next cigarette can be the one to trigger cancer, strokes or heart attacks. WISH ME LUCK!

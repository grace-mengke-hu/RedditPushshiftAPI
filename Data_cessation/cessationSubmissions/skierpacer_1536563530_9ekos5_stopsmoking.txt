Lapsed at the 25th hour

...and I almost made it. Right about when I was to go to sleep, a strong craving came about and I took that last cigarette from last night out and lapsed.

Generally I steer clear of posting online, but I can't express how helpful this community has been in the last 24 hours as I have been trying this cold turkey.

Gonna keep at it and see where this goes. Not discouraged, but a slight cold had me guessing if the quitting was affecting me in a weird way. Quite silly of me.

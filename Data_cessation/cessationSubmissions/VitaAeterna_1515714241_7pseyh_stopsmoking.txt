Feeling down/lethargic after making some life changes

So for the new years, me and my girlfriend decided to make some big changes. Were both overweight, heavy smokers, and big drinkers. After the new year we completely quit smoking, cut back on the drinking, and started meal prepping and counting calories, eating healthier. I completely cut out sodas, energy drinks and sweets and haven't had any of those or a cigarette since NYE.

Physically, I actually feel great. But mentally, its tough to find motivation to do anything. My girlfriend reported the same symptoms. We talk about starting going to the gym, or out for walks/runs but now were too lazy to even clean the house. I don't want to do anything but sit at my PC and play video games, and she does nothing but sit and watch tv and knit.

 Even going to work is a chore. I work as a chef, and have for 10+ years. Alcohol and cigarettes were my crutch. I've been doing great with my diet and quitting smoking, but I just feel burnt out already. I struggled with depression a bit in my early 20s and this feels kinda the same

Any advice on what causing it and how to fix it? Will it just pass as my body adjusts? Is it just withdrawals?

Just starting my journey!

So to begin I was smoking since I was 15, I'll be 31 this year. I've been on nicotine replacement patches for a little over a week, currently on my 9th day. Here's my question for all of you who've walked this walk. Would I be better to remove the crutch so I can purge the nicotine all at once?

As I've made it this far I have a false sense of security and I am aware of it since I've handled my urges thus far but I know it's nothing compared to come turkey. But I feel like I would suffer through withdrawal either way.

Just looking for advice and any pointers you all can provide. Just don't want to delay the inevitable but wary of relapse. Blah I guess should I stay the course I'm on or try cold turkey. I always have my patches if need be.

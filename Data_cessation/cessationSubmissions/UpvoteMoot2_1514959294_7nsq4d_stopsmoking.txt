I still currently smoke 2+ packs a day and it's killing me... literally.

I would love to quit smoking. I'm 22 now and I've smoked since I was 16. It started out as trying a stale pack of cigarettes my father lost and I'm somewhat of an addict so once I felt that nicotine rush it didn't take long for me to get hooked. 

It wouldn't be long before I was smoking a pack a day. Like, not long at all. Maybe a month. I couldn't get over the nicotine rush, and I was addicted to other drugs at the time which just added to my love of smoking.

Now I'm 22, smoke 2+ packs a day, and I'm scared. I wake up EVERY morning with almost "locked" lungs where I have to intentionally take HUGE deep breaths to open my lungs for the day. It's a very painful process and it terrifies me of what my lungs must look like. I can barely breathe in my sleep, and only take very shallow breathes.

I also cough up tar, and on some bad days a tar/blood mixture. I'm not talking a little brown spit a day. I know it's gross, but I used a small white plastic cup as a spittoon. After a day of spitting all of my tar chunk loogies into it I let it dry. I know it's gross but I wanted to convince myself to stop. Anyway, the next day there was almost an inch of dry crackly tar that honestly gives me nightmares. I'm petrified of dying. I'm even more petrified of ever needing a tracheotomy. I want to be healthy, but it's not easy for me. 

I went through the hardest times of my life smoking. It relaxes me. I've built more than a habit. I've built a COMPULSION. I don't want to die but I don't know how to stop...

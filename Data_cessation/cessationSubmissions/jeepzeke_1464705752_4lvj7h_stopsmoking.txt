For those who have quit after me: It has been much easier the last couple of weeks.

Nothing compares to the first week or so. However recently I was having smaller cravings very frequently and the lure of "just one' was more appealing. Maybe it was my body last desperate attempt for me to go back. Who knows. Just posting this so people can deal with it if it happens to them. Peace.

A symptom of quitting?

Howdy!

I'm hoping to get some insight about a symptom that has come up since I quit smoking. I've been smoke free for about 2 months now and feel great. However, the one strange thing that seems to be getting worse is shortness of breathe. 

It can be as simple as walking for a minute and I just feel like I ran up a flight of stairs. I haven't experienced this when I was smoking, but now it seems to be getting gradually worse. 

Anyone experience this at all? Ideas what maybe causing it?

Thanks!!

Tonight I will smoke the last cigarettes, tomorrow I am a no smoker.

The only moment I really fear, is the moment I have my coffee in the morning. The craving will be the worst. If I succeed at resisting that crave, the rest of day will go alright. I am now sober from alcohol for more than half a year and I feel comfortable enough with that to kick that stupid smoking in the balls too. My tactic for tomorrow is to jump straight out of bed in the shower so I will feel fresh and smell nice. Tomorrow morning I will also apply for a badge here. I planned this two week ago to mentally prepare myself. That also worked the last time when I quit for five months but relapsed due to alcohol. I will visit here lots, I think, I look forward to tomorrow but I'm also a bit scared to fail. Fingers crossed.

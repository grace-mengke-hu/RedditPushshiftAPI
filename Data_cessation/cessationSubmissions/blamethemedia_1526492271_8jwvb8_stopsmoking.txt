A week into attempt number 2

I made it from October to February and then fell off. I’m using a phix e-cigarette and the smoke free app. I used the app last time but got lazy, when I checked it again to see all the time that would have passed, the health progress and the money I would have saved I felt really guilty. I’m really trying again, it’s been just over a week and I feel fine right now, but I still find smoking to be so attractive. Also having a bit of an identity crisis considering myself a non smoker. I have a hard time with the mantra, and picturing myself having “not one puff ever again”, but that was my problem the last time, and I made so many excuses for smoking. Any advice from you all beating this thing would be a big help.

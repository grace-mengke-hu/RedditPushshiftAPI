"I really feel like a cigarette..."

"...What am I saying?! No I don't!" (and either do you)

Scarily, I've said this a few times recently. Close to 3 months in and going strong. Just wanted to say hi you guys, and well done for all your hard work! It's come to my attention recently that even after knowing for sure I'm a non-smoker and planning on staying that way, it is true you'll sometimes feel an urge to have one. Just always remember how stupid the things are in the first place & you'll never go wrong :)

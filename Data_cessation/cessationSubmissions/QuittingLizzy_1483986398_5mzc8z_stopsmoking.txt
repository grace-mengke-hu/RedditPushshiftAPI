"I'm not addicted to smoking, I just need a couple every hour or so, so I don't go completely insane" - Peter Griffin

I was watching Family Guy last night, and it was the episode where Peter starts smoking...this quote really hit close to home. 


Anyway, since the New Year I have managed to cut down smoking cigarettes significantly from where I was before. I was at around a pack a day (sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less) and I'm currently averaging around 5 or 6. Not perfect yet, but it is a good step in the right direction! :)

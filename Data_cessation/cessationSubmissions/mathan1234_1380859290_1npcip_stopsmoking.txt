WTF? I didn't realize I was supposed to have SO MUCH energy!

So during my official day 2 of no smoking, I don't recall getting SO MUCH STUFF done. I was full of energy all day. I'm not sure if it's the lack of smoking, or just a fluke. But I think it's from quitting smoking. 
  
I didn't realize that a normal person is supposed to feel this way. I'm sure some days will be better than others, but still, this is awesome, *fuck smoking!!*

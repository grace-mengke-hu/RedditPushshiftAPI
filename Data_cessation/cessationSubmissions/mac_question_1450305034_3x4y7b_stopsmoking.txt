On the Allen Carr AMA and bridging the gap with e-cigarette users

Full disclosure: I am still addicted to nicotine, and I am an "e-cigarette" user.

I believe that this option, *as an option*, should be seen by more folks. Vapers do have a habit of being holier-than-thou, and... well, being condescending pricks. But it is a real option, and I figured we should start a conversation about it.

For me, I tried cold turkey twice and failed. I tried gum next and failed. I tried a vaporizer and haven't smoked in two months.
 
It's a real option, and I think we should talk about it. If any vapeholes show up, we can agree to downvote them together. If any scientific evidence is linked (and I mean real papers), we can agree to read them together. Let's do this, /r/stopsmoking!

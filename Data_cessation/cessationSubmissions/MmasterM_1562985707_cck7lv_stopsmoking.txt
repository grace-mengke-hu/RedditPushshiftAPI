Quit smoking but thinking about starting

Hey
I was smoking for 10 years, quit last October.
I quit suddenly and randomly and ever since then I’ve been thinking about smoking.
It’s not that I need it as much as I just want to smoke cause am bored. I miss the feeling of it.
Is this normal and what are other ways to keep on going ?

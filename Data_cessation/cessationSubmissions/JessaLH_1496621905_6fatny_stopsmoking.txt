Still a non smoker

These past few days I have wanted a smoke a bit more than usual and I'm not sure why. My brain has been trying a lot to convince me but today I was at a family reunion and everyone kept asking around for lighters to smoke and I'm still proud to tell them "sorry don't have one, I don't smoke". 

Glad for the extra money I have now and the healthy changes quitting led me to and many more things. Just glad to still be a non smoker and looking forward to the day when cravings will be really far apart.

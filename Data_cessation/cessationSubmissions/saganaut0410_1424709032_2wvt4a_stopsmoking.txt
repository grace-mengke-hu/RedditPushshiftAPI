Day 3, "Quitter's Flu"

I have not had a cigarette since Friday morning. As an almost 23 year old male, I have been smoking about ten years.

I have had flu-like symptoms since Friday night and was wondering if anyone had any insight into how long this might last. I had to miss work, classes and several meetings today because I could hardly get out of bed.

relapse after a year

so today i relapsed, a friend had left 1/3 of a burned out cig in a cup and after he went home i smoked it, i then went out and bought a pack. in the past year i have used snus (a swedish oral tobacco) as a substitute for my nictoine addiction but now its just not enough, despite containing 8 times more nicotine than a cigarette i can no longer hold back the desire to smoke and this time i'm not sure if i can actually quit the devil sticks (maybe thats why i'm crying about it here) you see the problem is that i have an addictive personality. Any mood altering substances i ingest i have a hard time quitting and cigarettes are one of them, i think the reason i struggle with cigs is that i started to smoke quite early (age 13) so they have been a part of my teenage years thus all the good memories are usually attached to smoking, if anyone know a god way to kick the addiction to cigarettes themself ( not nicotine ) it would be greatly apreaciated 

and sorry for any bad english spelling as i am wrighting this quite drunk

I've gone 27 days - will the craving start to lessen soon?

I smoked 20+ a day for around 2 years (I'm 19 now) and decided to quit last month because I was spending upwards of Â£200 a month on cigarettes and that wasn't a great way of spending my hard-earned cash. 
Anyway, I've noticed that the cravings haven't even begun to dissipate and I'm starting to worry. Will they start to at least lessen soon? I recognise that they may not go away altogether, at least not for a while, but it's driving me crazy that I still feel like a smoker and I still get the same level of craving as I would have gotten when I was still smoking.

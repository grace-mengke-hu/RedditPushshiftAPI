try try again

i just installed the quitnow app on my phone. today is my birthday and my present to myself will be to quit smoking again, this time for good. (THIS TIME FOR GOOD).

i know it doesn't mean anything to post this, because i've posted many times and keep failing.  
  
i will continue to fight the good fight. any attempt to quit smoking, even if it is short lived, is still that many less cigarettes in your body.  
  
  
keep fighting.

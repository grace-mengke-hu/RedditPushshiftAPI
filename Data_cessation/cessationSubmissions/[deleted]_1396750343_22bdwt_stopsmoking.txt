Failed my first serious attemp. I need your help

The first couple of days went great then I had a huge craving in the afternoon at work and I couldnt control myself. I felt terrible. I just had my last cigarrette again. And I want to quit for good now. I dont have a smartphone so I cant have any of those clever apps to help me motivate. 
Do you guys have any reading materias, tips and other advice about quitting?

Ps. If there are any grammar errors english is not my first language.

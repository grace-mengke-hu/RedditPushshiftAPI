1/2 a year...man I didn't think I'd make it.

My health has greatly improved! (although I have gained a bit of weight).

I'm generally happier--I can breathe--I don't smell--I've saved about $915 bucks and not smoked 2,900 cigs. My allergies aren't as severe as they have been in the past--this winter has been the easiest of my life since I started smoking (chest not tight in the mornings--no hacking cough)

It's been the best decision of my life--and I just need to thank all of you for the support! Here's to a year!

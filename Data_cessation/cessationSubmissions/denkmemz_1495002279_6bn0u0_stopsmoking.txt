2 weeks smoke free

Never felt better. I'm 2 weeks without a cigarette. The cravings are nowhere near as intense. I'm sleeping well and dreaming but was wondering is it normal to dream almost every night about smoking? I wake up in the morning and keep thinking I've cheated and had a cigarette but then realize it was just a dream.

Do E-Cigs count?

I started vaping on march 14th. I have not had a drag off of a cigarette since I started. Although I am still "inhaling" nicotine, I have noticed all of the typical benefits of stopping smoking. I've had people tell me that it doesn't count. What does the Reddit community think about this? Am I right to not identify myself as a smoker anymore?

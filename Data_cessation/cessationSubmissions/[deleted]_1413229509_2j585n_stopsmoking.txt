Is smoking a Cuban cheating?

Because I did.  While drinking some very old Remy XO after my good friend's wedding.  Felt like it was something that you'll only get so many chances to do, especially under the circumstances.  I was really torn about it, but it was a celebration.  I'll add it was not a per-meditated cigar, but rather offered late in the evening (or early in the morning).  Maybe if it hadn't been a Cuban I wouldn't have?  I'm not sure.  If I wasn't hammered I'm fairly certain I wouldn't have.

This was Saturday night and I can comfortably say I didn't have any extra cravings yesterday or today as a result.  Good lord though my throat's been killing me since.

Personally I'm not chalking it up as cheating or relapsing, and I'm opting not to reset my counter or anything like that.  Any opinions on it?  Any similar stories?

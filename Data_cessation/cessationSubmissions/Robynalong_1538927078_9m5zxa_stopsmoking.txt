Day 13 smoke free

I’ve quit many times every time gets easier, and I learn more techniques. My cravings are usually worse in the morning. I was thinking about quitting coffee but that’s as far as it got. I’m going to really try to stick with it this time. Smoking ain’t worth the health problems it brings.

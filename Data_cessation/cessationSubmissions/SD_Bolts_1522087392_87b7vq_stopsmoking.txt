1 month without smoking... happy, but not feeling any better.

Anyone have a similar experience? I smoked every day for 10 years. Now I quit cold turkey and haven’t smoked in a month. My breathing still sucks and the “smokers cough” and feeling in the back of my throat is worse than when I smoked a pack a day. I’m constantly trying to clear my throat and rarely succeeding. I don’t feel any better than when I smoked. 

I’m glad I quit, I’m saving a shit ton of money (nearly 10 bucks a day adds up) and I don’t have any intention of starting again, but when should I feel better physically?

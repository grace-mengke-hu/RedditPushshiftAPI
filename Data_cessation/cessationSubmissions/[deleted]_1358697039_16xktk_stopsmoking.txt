Quitter's flu

So, day 4 for me! I feel great! Except for the side effects of my body's recovery. The sore throat started last night, and it's pretty sharp. The cough is getting worse but it is extremely productive, so I don't mind it. I figure this is the price you pay for years of abusing your system. To the non smokers on here who are much further along in recovering than I am: How long did this last for you?

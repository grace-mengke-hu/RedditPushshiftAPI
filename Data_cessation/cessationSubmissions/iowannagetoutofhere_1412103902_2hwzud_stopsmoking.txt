Today, I reset my badge. :(

I just requested my badge be reset... soon my 154 days will be lost. This is really hard. I know I played a mental game with myself yesterday, but dammit, I gave in. $11.50 later, I was sick to my stomach with disgust, shame and self-loathing. I know I can do this, but some days the urge takes over and I turn completely mad.  Going to give it another go... I DON'T WANT TO BE A SMOKER ANYMORE!!!!!!

Thanks for reading.

Struggling today

So, tomorrow will be 1 month smokefree and I am struggling today really bad for some reason. :(  I have been using my vape some (with zero nicotine) to get thru some bad cravings,  I thought once I reached the 30 day mark that I would be able to give up the vape and get off the chantix. But the way I am feeling right now, I don't know if that's a good idea , I'm really worried. I haven't felt like this the whole quitting process. It's very scary.  Sorry, I think I just needed to get that off my chest incase my next post is about a slip up and do over. Which I really hope is not . Please keep fingers crossed I get passed this! TIA

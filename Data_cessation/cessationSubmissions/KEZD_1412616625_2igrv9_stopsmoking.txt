Holy shit I'm having cravings out of nowhere with a vengeance! I'm THIS close to buying a pack.

What happened? the past four days were so easy, but today, having had no alcohol, being alone in my room, I'm having extremely strong cravings since about two-and-a-half hours ago. There are no triggers here that werent here the past four days. What the fuck happened? I'm nervous.

Edit: I'm not pregnant, btw. ;)

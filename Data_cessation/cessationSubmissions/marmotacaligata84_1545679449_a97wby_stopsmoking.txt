Day 003. Brain fog is lifting. I can feel myself breathing better!

Hi guys.  Checking in.  at 10:25 A.M.  62 hours. ---   Cravings are still here, but they're different... not as painful.  My brain fog has started to lift.  Most astonishingly though, I can actually feel myself breathing better. I went for a walk first thing this morning instead of smoking a cigarette... and I could feel the cold air in and out of my lungs.  I walked briskly with no pain, wheezing, nothing! This is all in less than 72 hours. 


For those of you quitting: stay strong, you are not alone. The benefits are real.

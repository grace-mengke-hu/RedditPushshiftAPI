Started smoking again and almost killed my dog:(

Well as if I needed one more reason to stay quit. I had quit for 30 days and started again- I had the pack sitting on my bed and my dog ate it and all the cigarettes in it. 

Seizures ensued, I had to take her to the vet feeling like an absolute trash piece of shit to have to explain she ate my cigarettes. 

They had to induce vomiting and she is still in the animal hospital recovering. 

The bill will be close to $1000- all because I thought it would be ok to start smoking again. 

I fee like an absolute and complete moron- and am so mad at myself that my addiction to cigarettes caused my poor sweet doggie so much pain and suffering. 

Just wanted to share.

Again, again and again!

I've been smoking for ...almost half of my life. Recently I gave it up for 2 months and then started again. I still want to quit, because it is killing me. I was so happy smoking free, but failed it.

However, I want to start it again today, I will quit cold turkey. Nothing else woks for me.

Wish me good luck and I hope I'll keep you posted.

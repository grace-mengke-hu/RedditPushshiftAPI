Heavy Smoker (15 years) trying to quit.

I already failed after a little over 35 hours. Bought a pack of Menthol to feel just a tiny bit better about it and smoked 2 cigarettes (2 hours inbetween them).

Haven't smoked for 11 hours now but I'm craving it sooo bad. 

This isn't the first time I tried to quit. I tried it 2012, had no problem at all and stopped for around 6 months, then just started again because I felt safe and wanted to "celebrate" the Halo 4 release with beer and smokes.

I would get mad easily back then, but I didn't crave it at all. This time however, it's so different. Maybe it's because I feel a lot of pressure and stress at this point in my life. I'm supposed to be learning right now, but it's just not possible, I'm so distracted and irritated. I can't concentrate, I feel like a looser for failing yesterday and I'm ashamed because of it.

I love smoking, always have, some people are like "I do it to loose weight" or "I'm quitting because of my health", some do it to be cool, but I never did it for any of those reasons, I just loved the feeling, everything about it. And I was well aware what smoking does to my health way before I started. I don't have any motivation for health reasons and not even really for money reasons. I know that I could use 120â‚¬ per month for other stuff but I don't really care about that either.

It's the people around me (to be precise mainly my mother and sister) who want me to quit.

I don't even know what the hell I'm trying to accomplish really. I feel like my issues are somewhere else entirely.  Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses. I don't even know.

I know I can easily reduce the amount I smoke, but I don't really want to quit. Friday when my best friend comes (Who is also smoking) I don't want to ruin our meetup, we see eath other just 1 or 2 times per month and he is the only person I actually consider a real friend. I don't want to down the atmosphere with this whole non smoker shit (I hate people like that myself tbh).

I'm all over the place, I apologize for this mess of a post but I hope you can give me some tips, I don't need any health related tipps, I know all it's downsides better than the average person. I guess I want to know if there are others that loved to smoke, and quit in an "harsch environment" (I don't want to ignore other smoker/get out of their way).

tl;dr: LOVE Smoking, trying to quit but not even sure if I want, have no real reasons in my head to quit. Give me encouragement I guess.

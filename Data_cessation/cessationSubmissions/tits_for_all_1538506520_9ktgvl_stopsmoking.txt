SOS ... NEED URGENT HELP!! POSSIBLE RELAPSE

Ok, so after averaging a pack and a half for the past several years, total smoking years being ~ 15, I finally had my last cigarette on 22nd March this year. Today is (was?) my 194th nicotine-free day.  

However, I have been having the occasional joint in this period constituting of just good ole' weed which in my books is ok and no way a violation of my nicotine cessation. Today though was a little strange, I was out drinking with friends and was not carrying any stuff with me. A friend had some nice Eastern hash on him and he rolled a big fat spliff with tobacco and hash and in a moment of weakness I knowingly had two drags - for the hash and not for the nicotine - but nevertheless, I ingested nicotine after 194 days. 

Now I am back home freaking out and reading relapse horror stories. Have I relapsed or is it just a momentary slip which in the long run won't matter? Or do I need to take some action to make sure that in the coming days this does not turn into a full-blown relapse?

Look forward to your support and advice,
Thanks

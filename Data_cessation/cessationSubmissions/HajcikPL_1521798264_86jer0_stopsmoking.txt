370 days quit!

Well, I've done it. I was here half year ago complaining how much I do struggle with my decision to quit vaping and nicotine in general, and here I am.
I did it.
It was tough but after 7 months I finally was able to live without the urge to vape/smoke.
Incredible thing how it changed me as a person.
If you want, AMA!
I would love to chit chat with some of you in this sub!

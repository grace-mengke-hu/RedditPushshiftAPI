Newcomers here, I had a question...

Hello, my name is Luigi, I am 21 and have been a smoker for 4 years. 

I know that's not a great feat, but I decided to quit smoking by the time I get back on campus after winter break; For my health (asthma), gf, and stress management, I want to be a smoke-free person.

I just had a question for now-quitters:

My Apollo E-Cigarette came in the mail today, does anyone have experience with E-Cigs? Do they wean off smoking or do they just sustain the addiction?

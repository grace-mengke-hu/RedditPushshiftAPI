Went two weeks without smoking, started to have days without cravings, then went on vacation with my partner, who smokes, and craved until I caved. Been smoking for two days :(

I guess I got complacent and lost my vigilance against the lies of the addiction - "just one," "won't hurt," etc. It's amazing how you can intellectually KNOW that these are lies, to be very well aware of all the reasons to never have another puff, to even be reaping the innumerable benefits of being a nonsmoker, but then the addiction just slides in when you're off guard and takes control. I was just looking over my posts and comments in this sub over the past couple weeks and wondering if I even really *felt* all the things I was saying. This sucks.

At least I know that it's entirely possible to quit. My new quit date is tomorrow when we get home.

How can I use this relapse as a learning experience to be stronger next time?

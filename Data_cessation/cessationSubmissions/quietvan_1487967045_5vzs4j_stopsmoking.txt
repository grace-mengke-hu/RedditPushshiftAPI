Day 1

Hi,

I am quitting 3 things today: weed, masturbation, and smoking. Smoking is probably the least beneficial thing to me that has the most adverse affects on my health. Whereas for the other 3 habits I'm breaking, I've written up a benefits section fo continuing it's use, there is very little to write here for that. Smoking is an overall problematic habit that provides a small source of relief, maintained through the continued habit of smoking.

I have written up a contract and signed it, confirming I will quit. If I have cravings or pressure to relapse I will post it here. I look forward to the grass being greener. It wont be easy but will be beneficial.

Thank you.

Today: I finished my last pack and when my coworker leaves, I will discontinue the habit.

Chantix / champix advice for when to quit the cigarettes. Not feeling any different yet and it's day 7

I was led to believe that Champix would reduce the desire for / enjoyment of cigarettes by around day 7 or so, and that day 8 to 14 was the time to quit.  Yet I'm still enjoying them and they don't taste any different, on day 7.  I did wonder if it was because I smoke roll-ups with menthol filters which have a different feel to filter cigarettes.  I've set my quit day for tomorrow but worry in case it's a bit early, if the Champix hasn't done it's neuro-receptor thing yet.

Brief bio - smoked for 30 years, gave up cold turkey 6 years ago, started again a year ago.  Currently 15-20 roll-ups a day.

I have officially missed 720 cigarettes.

Holy fuck.

How in the hell did I never think about the number of cigarettes I smoked? I seriously want to punch myself in the face while also puking because I am so pissed off at myself. 720 cigarettes is what I would have smoked in the past 36 days.

I've saved about $216 as well (thinking an average of $6 a pack).

Why did I ever do that to myself? 

I seriously think back to all the times I thought about quitting and didn't, and I'm some how really depressed with myself today. God, I've missed so much. I've missed so much time and so much money. Why did I ever think that was ok? Right now, looking back, there's not one memorable cigarette. Sure, memorable moments where I was smoking, but that little stick in my hands was not the focus. I could take it or leave it.

Guys, leave it. Leave it as quick as you can. I'm so pissed off I didn't do it before.

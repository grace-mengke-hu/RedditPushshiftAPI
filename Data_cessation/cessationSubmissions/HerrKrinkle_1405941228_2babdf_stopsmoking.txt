5-day plan & Champix

Hi Everyone. I've been smoking for more than 20 years. About a pack a day. I've tried quitting 4-5 times in the past 3-4 years, but failed every time. I tried multiple ways. Cold-turkey 2-3 times and last time, I tried to use nicotine gums and e-cigs together, but even that didn't work. I had posted on day 1 back then, but never dared to come back after I started smoking again. Well, I'm back, but looking for help this time.

A family member was successful with champix and experienced no side effects; which are what I'm the most afraid of with it. I've read some pretty bad things about the side effects, especially on mood swings and suicidal thoughts.

I've also just read some good things about the 5-day Plan, but I don't know much about it. 

I'm over it and I need help at this point. Has any one of you tried either champix or the 5-day Plan? Thanks all.

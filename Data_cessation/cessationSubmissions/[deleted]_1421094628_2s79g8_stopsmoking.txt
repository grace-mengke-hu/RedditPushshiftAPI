Have you guys experienced this stuff with withdrawal? What else can I expect?

I'm going to try my umpteenth time trying to quit smoking (and nicotine products), and the longest I've made it is 5 days cold turkey. During that time cravings weren't my problem, nicotine withdrawal was. 

Here's what I experienced: 

* Cloudy mind, forgetfulness, dizziness, feeling like my brain was replaced by a Styrofoam facsimile
* Mental confusion - doing the same commute I've done for over two years now, I'd look around and think, "where the hell am I? Am I on the right road?" Like, I'll have moments where everything just looks completely different! It only takes a few seconds to snap back, though, but it's still kinda freaky.
* Physically stronger, more motivated, more energetic, and the emotional richness of life starts coming back (I'm pretty sensitive, so maybe that's my own thing ... or not!)
* Start to panic because these withdrawal symptoms freak me out (like that moment when you smoke marijuana and you realize you aren't in Kansas anymore) --- this is when I start smoking again. It's not a craving, it's more like, get me out of here!

Can anyone relate? Any tips to overcome this? Anything else to expect? I really want to quit nicotine because it's like living life with a ball and chain attached to my leg, and I want my energy, motivation, and health back so I can start living life again. 

Thanks!

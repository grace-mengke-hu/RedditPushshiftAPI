Smoking with the patch on?

So I've been smoking for 11 years now at about half a pack a day and this is the first time I've tried quitting. I started the patch yesterday I smoked 3 cigarettes in the morning and put the patch on at about noon amd didn't smoke a cigarette till about 11pm before bed after I took the patch off. Now today I put the patch on about 5 hours ago and smoked one an hour ago. Now I'm telling myself that it's ok to smoke one or two while having the patch on in the beginning of trying to quit because I'm not smoking near as much as I used to. Do y'all think that's a good idea to wean off smoking with the patch or is it better to just go ahead and completely quit smoking since I have the patch on? Any advice is appreciated as I'm new to trying to quit

27 days! yesssss!

At first I was dreading quitting. Each day without a cigarette felt like forever. Add the headaches, depression, irritability and it really did feel like the days were never going to end. But then those symptoms started subsiding and I didn't feel like a dirty butthole most of the day. (yay) 

I seriously couldn't have done it without this sub and you guys, the only thing that kept me from pulling out all of my hair was seeing my badge change every day. So, wanted to say thanks everyone, we're all here for the same thing and I hope we can help as many people kick this disgusting habit as soon as possible.

I still have cravings but I noticed that they come up when I'm not in my element, when I have anxiety about something. When I'm sober I'll think of cigarettes but not in a cravings way ( I want one now type of thing) but in a reminiscing type of way ( look how much fun we had together). Weird I know, but I'll get cravings in social situations and especially when I'm not 100% comfortable. Good thing is I know my triggers and can easily identify them. 

On that note, (almost) one month down of being a non-smoker and I couldn't be happier.

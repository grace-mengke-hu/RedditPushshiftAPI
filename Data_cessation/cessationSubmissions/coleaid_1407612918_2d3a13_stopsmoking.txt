Resetting my badge for tomorrow

Fuck.


EDIT: One of my coworkers' mother just passed this morning, and I was stuck with this feeling in my gut. Thinking about her loss made me worry about what she was going through. I went through a lot when I lost my mother almost a year ago, and I found myself at Wawa buying a pack and smoking without even thinking about it. I was there, but it was this weird disconnect.


Well, here's to being a non-smoker again tomorrow.

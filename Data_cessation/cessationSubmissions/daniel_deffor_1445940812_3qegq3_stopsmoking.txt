Day 4 and I had a shit driving lesson today.

So I had a driving lesson just now on day four of not smoking and I sucked pretty bad.

A couple of days ago I would be sitting behind the wheel just looking at that clock waiting until I could forget about it with a nice smoke. 

Fuck it. I did bad. I'll do better next time. Smoking won't make my driving better. Not gonna do it.

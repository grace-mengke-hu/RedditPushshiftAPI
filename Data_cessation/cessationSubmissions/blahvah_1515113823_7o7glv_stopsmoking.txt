why do you count your days even after long time quit?

Not trying to offend you,  but I really get upset when I see celebration post for like 350 days or more. If you're non-smoker for that long and it has been good for your health, why do you still count your days. Feels like maybe you're still not happy or missing it or not really free from it? I can't even make 2 or 3 days without it. So, seeing those posts I think to myself fuck it I will die from it rather than  Every single day reminding myself how hard it is and how great I am not doing it. I want to be free, I don't want to even think about it. I hate it so much.

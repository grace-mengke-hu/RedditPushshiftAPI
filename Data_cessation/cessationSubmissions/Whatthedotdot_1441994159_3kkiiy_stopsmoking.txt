100 days today!

I've smoked for about 22 of the past 26 years, 15-20 roll ups every day, the first within 30 of waking up. On June 3rd my sister and her boyfriend got married, it was a full day of being around non-smokers, so that was the day I chose. I had 2 cravings that first day and have maybe had two or three since then. I've had nights out, I've been around smokers, and I keep asking myself 'how come it's so easy this time'? I think it's this - next June I turn 40. I started smoking at 13 and have been battling it ever since, and I am done. Enough. It's over. I feel so free, but I will keep counting the days because I fear complacency. I've also realised that if I ever again cave and have 'just one' then I'm effectively signing myself up for another year of 20 a day, coughing every morning, constantly clearing my throat, setting a bad example to my two teenagers. Plus 100 days has landed on my son's 15th birthday, it feels like some kind of sign!

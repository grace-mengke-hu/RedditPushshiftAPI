Just havin a beer and feelin all the feels for y'all

It's been SO hectic at work today; I'm a server and it's prez's day so everyone and their mamas are out and I've been dealin with a bunch of out of town/ never stepped into a restaurant before crazies all day (read: 8 1/2 hrs). It's at this point that I would be outside chain smoking before my walk home then smoke all the way home too! But instead I'm enjoying a beer and getting ready to breathe in the fresh air on my walk home! /u/OpheliaOnFire /u/fakopako /u/bikeridinman you guys and many others are awesome and have helped me along these past 16 days. I don't wanna say I couldn't have done it without you because I know that it's dangerous to lean on anyone for something so big and so personal but you've really been such huge helps in such big and small ways. So many people here have. Thanks guys! Keep posting shit for me to read when I crave and keep on not smoking! Yay us! Best club!

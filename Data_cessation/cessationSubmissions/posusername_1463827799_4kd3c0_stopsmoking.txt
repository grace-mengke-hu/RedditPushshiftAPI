Nicotine patch question

Hello! I am on my second serious attempt to quit smoking. My first was with Chantix earlier this year and that did not go well. That one person here who told me the depression was going to kick my ass was right! I didn't last two weeks but I digress. 

I haven't had a cigarette in over 24 hours and have been using the patch just about the same amount of time. I started with the highest dosage patch but I honestly don't want to prolong the amount of time I use the patch nor want to continue throwing money away on nicotine. 

My question is, would it be smart to not repurchase patches after I'm done with this box (7 count, have 5 left) and basically quit cold turkey? I figured that a week without actual cigarettes would be a very good start to letting them go completely. The patch would serve as a buffer of sorts but it's not something I want to do for 8 weeks, I just want to be rid of all this stuff completely.

Almost 300 days and I just want to say thanks!

I just want to say thanks to everyone on this subreddit. I have taken my life back and turned it completely around. I was an absolute wreck before I quit smoking and thanks to all the wonderful people here and all the encouragement that you give people like me to take a step forward in the right direction I am living the good life! 

When I first came to this subreddit I was sitting in my car smoking my last cigarette in the pack that I had just bought 3 days before. I knew that I had to quit and you guys helped me get through the roughest parts of quitting. Now, I don't even think about smoking! So, to all of you who are struggling or thinking about quitting, YOU CAN DO IT!!! Everyone here is more than willing to help and has been through the same things you are going through right now. Get a badge and show off how well you are doing! We will be here to celebrate and help build you back up if you slip up!

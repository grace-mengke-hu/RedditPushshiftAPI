Quit smoking last NYE and forgot about my anniversary!

Not smoking is now as natural and normal to me as smoking was before I quit. I can't imagine myself smoking now - in the same way that before I quit I couldn't imagine myself not smoking. So it just goes to show! I feel even more calm and relaxed than back when I had a cigarette in my hands. This year has brought about some huge positive changes and I'm really pleased I quit. To all you NYE smokers, GO FOR IT! Stay strong! It gets easier and easier and easier and easier until it's not even a thing any more. Just stick it out - you got this. The smoke free life is worth it :) I look forward to reading your happy and proud posts in a year to come

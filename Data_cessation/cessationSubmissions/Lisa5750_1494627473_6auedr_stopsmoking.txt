No more rushing out into the pouring rain ...

I went out for a meal tonight - my sister's birthday. It was the first time I've been out since I stopped smoking 15 days ago. It was also the first time in 31 years that I didn't rush out after my starter to grab a quick cigarette. Now THAT was liberating! Freedom here I come ..👍🏽

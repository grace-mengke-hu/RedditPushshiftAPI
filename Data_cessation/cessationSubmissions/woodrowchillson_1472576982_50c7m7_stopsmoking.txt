Day 3. Sat at the office. Closer cravings in the afternoon.

Saturday night was my last cigarette. Sunday wasn't bad, yesterday was hard with headaches and being back at work and not smoking. I knew the third day was supposed to be the worst, but I haven't had any physiological withdraws today. But my brain wants the taste SO VERY BAD! Does the postive physical affects outweigh my desire to have a smoke? The ole 'gotta be ready' in order to quit? I'm just worried the desire never goes away.

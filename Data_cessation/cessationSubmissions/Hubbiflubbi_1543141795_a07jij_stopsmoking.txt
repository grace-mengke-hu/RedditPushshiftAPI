After smoking weed and tobacco daily for 5 years I'm one month clean today!

Got a few questions though. I read that it's normal to have cold-like symptoms after quitting, but can they persist for a whole month or should they have been gone by now? Also I'm thinking about starting to exercise, but I'm a bit worried because of my throat (and also because it's cold outside and I don't really have the money for new training clothes). Additionally, no matter how much I drink (mostly water and tea), my throat is bone dry in the morning and I feel severely dehydrated. Is this expected as well and can I do something about it?

I would be thankful for any advice you can give me, and maybe what you have done to help your body recover after quitting.

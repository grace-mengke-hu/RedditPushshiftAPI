Carr 3:16 says I just whopped your ass!

Hey, y'all!  I'm happy to report that I've gone 316 days without a cigarette.  And thanks to Allan Carr, I don't even want to smoke anymore.  

It's like I've finally moved on to becoming a true ex-smoker, rather than being on a nicotine break like I was every other time I quit.

Anyway, I just wanted to check in and pat myself on the back.  

To everyone else out there, keep up the good work and stay strong!

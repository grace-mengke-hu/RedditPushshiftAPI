Day 3!

I went on birth control on Sunday to regulate my periods and the doctor said if you smoke while on birth control, it fucks with everything. Maybe this is more of a concern for people who are sexually active (my bf and I are abstinent), but I'm taking it as an opportunity to give up the cancer sticks. FOR GOOD.

I've quit thousands of times, it feels. I think most people do. I've known for a while that it's a waste of my money and my health. I've finally decided that it's time for a change. My birth control might have been the push I needed to come to that decision, but realistically I don't want to be smoking around my children when I decide to go off it. I refuse.

Thanks for reading!

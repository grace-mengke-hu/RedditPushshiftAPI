Quit 10 days ago. Saved enough money to treat myself with Hitman 2 preorder. Now it's installing.

These little things makes me very very happy that I quit. During the days I often wish I haven't done it or I wish I could buy a pack but this shitty habbit is so expensive and unhealthy. Sometimes it is hard to visualise it but a little treat now and then should keep things in clear view.

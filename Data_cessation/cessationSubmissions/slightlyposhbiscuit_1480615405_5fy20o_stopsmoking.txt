Did anyone else start getting sick (cold/flu) more frequently in the months following quitting?

So, I smoked for 10 years (26 F) and I used to be naturally super healthy, despite my terrible habit. I rarely got sick if at all. Now, I'm 6 months into kicking he habit and I'm getting sick at an alarming rate. Once in September, twice in October, and now I'm sick again. It's all head colds with extremely swollen lymph nodes. 

Since quitting, I have started working out, taking vitamins, juicing, and being overall WAY healthier. So this whole sick thing is really frustrating. 

Did anyone else have these problems with quitting or can anyone explain why this is happening?

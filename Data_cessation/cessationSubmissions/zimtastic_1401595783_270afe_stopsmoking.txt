[NSV] Survived a weekend in Las Vegas without slipping (or losing my shirt)!

NSV = Non-smoking victory?

Went with the girlfriend to Las Vegas for the holiday last weekend.  Leading up to the trip, I had convinced myself that since I've made it 6 months, I can now have some smokes while partying in Sin City.

Thankfully, I brought my eCig, and just...well never bothered to actually go and buy cigarettes.  After the first night, my girlfriend told me she was proud I didn't have any cigarettes the night before - and this motivated me to keep up my streak.

I even made friends with a guy playing blackjack next to me, and he asked me if it was alright if he smoked.  I told him it was ok, and even considered buying one off him, but never did.

At the end of the day, I'm proud of the fact that I went to Las Vegas, partied, drank, gambled a little (came out ahead), and even went to Punk Rock Bowling - all without smoking.

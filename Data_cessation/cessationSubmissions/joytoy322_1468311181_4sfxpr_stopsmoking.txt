Two years gone pretty quickly!

Even though the counter says 731 days, I quit on July 12 of 2014 at ~6pm.

I just wanted to say that for any of you lurkers or people that are still in the beginning, I don't even think about it anymore. I had really bad smoking dreams for the first 6 months and that was probably the worst of it. Even though I smoked for about 9 years, I never felt a connection with smoking. I always wanted to get away from it, I was just scared. But after the year mark, I really stopped thinking about it. 

I'm really only making this post to first, wish everyone here good luck. You've all been awesome and extremely supportive. In the beginning of my journey, I don't know what I would have done without this community. So I thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything <3!!! 

And secondly, I'm unsubbing. I've posted here off and on in the past two years, first with my own struggle and then cheering on new posts. It's time for me to completely disassociate with smoking. So I'm taking off. Good luck to the rest of you, I know you'll all make it :)

Going to the cornershop

I'm out of sugar so need to go to the cornershop where I used to buy my tobacco, for the first time since I quit smoking. I'll have to resist  saying automatically "And 30g Golden Virginia, please". But today, I am the master of my fate and not the tobacco manufacturers. If I have trouble, I'm going to out myself and tell Mehmud that I am a non-smoker now. He, as a non-smoker himself, will be pleased for me!

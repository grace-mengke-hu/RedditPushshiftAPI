Is vaping considered relapse?

Hi guys, 

I'm a little bit disappointed right now. I've been so good for the past month and a half. But today my friend brought his e-cig to class and I couldn't help myself.

I took 5 puffs. I don't feel much in terms of physical changes except for a slight fog in the brain and a somewhat relaxed body. 

However, I can't help but feel like this is a big stink and that I've ruined the whole progress. Is this considered a relapse?

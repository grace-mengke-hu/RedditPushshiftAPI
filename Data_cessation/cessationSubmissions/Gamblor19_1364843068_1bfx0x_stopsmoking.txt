Missed my 365 days - Felt somewhat fast to get to a year. Here's to a life without tobacco !

How I did it: Will power and Allen Carr

How I feel: Not a whole bunch different actually. You just sort of forget about smoking. I think my biggest benefit is the smell. I don't smell like an ashtray anymore. Also my skin looks better and I look noticeably younger.

Would I go back: Hell no !

Anyone can absolutely do this as long as you are sick of smoking and genuinely want to quit.

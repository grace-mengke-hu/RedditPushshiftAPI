Went back while on holiday after 2+ years smoke free!

I was damn sure I'd never smoke again. I barely thought about cigarettes, barely had cravings and was disgusted by the smell. I got through two plus years smoke free...

Then I went on holiday 2 weeks ago and was in a country where I was surrounded by it 24/7, with cheap prices to boot. I caved whilst drinking then let myself smoke for the remainder of the trip. I smoked for about 10 days in total, some days 1 or 2, some days 10 depending if I was drinking. 

Anyway I'm back and I've completely stopped again, don't feel the desire for one at all. I'm adamant that I will not continue this at home. But this experience really broke me as person... If I could let this slip after 2 years when my guard was down for two seconds, what else could happen?

Does anyone also know if quitting this time will be less intense than two years ago when I was a full time pack a day smoker? I sure hope it is, especially since I already don't feel any cravings at all really, but I'm still scared somehow I'll let myself slip. 

Cheers!

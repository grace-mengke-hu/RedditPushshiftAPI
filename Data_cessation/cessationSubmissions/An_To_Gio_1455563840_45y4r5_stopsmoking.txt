[Advice] Should I mind my own business?

I have just overheard my parents (with whom I'm not amicable terms) talking about quitting smoking.
She wants to quit cold turkey with no planning whatsoever, he wants to bet on whom is going to give up first.
Neither of them looks like the most promising start.
Should I mind my own business and keep on not smoking on my own?

This Time I Mean it

Ok so I'm 37 years old been smoking since i was 18.  Have tried many times to give up.  Made deals with myself like I'm going to quit by the time i'm 30 ,31, 32 etc but today i had a real eye opener.  After dinner i was watching my 3yo boy playing in the garden and as soon as he went out the door he started pretending to smoke a ciggarette just like daddy does.  That really hit home with me.  You can always justify it to yourself when you think that it is only you it is affecting but to see someone who basically idolises you pretending to smoke so he can be just like daddy just made me want to cry.  I realise now that as much as it is that i need to quit smoking for myself there are other people out there that it affects as well.  So as of now no more ciggarettes.

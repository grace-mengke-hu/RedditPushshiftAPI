Day one

29 years old. First cigarette at 19 (worst idea ever). I once quit for a little over a year and thought that since I quit for a year, that I had control over it. Nope. Right back in to smoking. That was about 5 years ago. I have given it up for a week or two here and there but always came back to it. Now, I am giving it a go again. It was only recently that I admitted to my friends and myself that this is an addiction. Before, it was something I simply wanted to do because I enjoy it. I am hoping to stick with it for good this time. As much as I loved smoking, I look forward to being able to exercise for more than 15 minutes without feeling like I am going to collapse. I look forward to a (hopefully) longer, happier life. Not really sure what I am looking for out of this subreddit, but I will do my best to keep you all posted on my progress. Today, I was extremely agitated and a bit depressed, knowing that I would not be smoking. I have been snacking way too much. I avoided leaving my house other than going to work and right back home, in fear of breaking down and buying a pack of special blends. I hate how something so small can have such a large impact on my mental and physical well being. Ok, I am done rambling. Good luck, everyone, and God bless!

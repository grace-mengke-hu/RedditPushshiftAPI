The urges are back, and stronger than ever, because I'm stressed...

I need help.. I work somewhere that sells cigarettes.. I quit 109 days ago, and I'm stressed to the gills. I'm going through relationship problems with my fiancée, and I have just about no friends, I'm depressed and suicide crosses my mind at least once a night. I told myself that if things with my fiancée go wrong and I end up alone yet again, I'm going to start smoking again to cope with the pain. I don't think that's going to happen but I have a LOT on my mind. I'm having strong urges, today I was actually going to buy a pack but I posted on Facebook about having urges and she called me and said she loves me, and told me not to start again. She said if I have another craving, to call her and talk because she's off today.  I'm starting to shake because the stress and urges, and I'm only 21 years old. It's calling to me.. It almost has me.. I'm starting to reminisce in the nostalgia of socializing while smoking. It's bringing the positive memories back.. Help me guys, how do I avoid the urges?

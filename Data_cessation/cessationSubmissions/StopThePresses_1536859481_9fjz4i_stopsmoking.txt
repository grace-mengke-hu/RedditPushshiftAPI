Only half a day down, and I'm so fucking mad at myself.

I HATE how bad I want a cigarette. I read the Easy Way book and I really thought I was all on board, but right now I'm staring at a half a cig and crying like an idiot cause I can't make myself throw it away because I want it SO FUCKING BAD and I know it's dumb and I shouldn't because what would be the point except the lose those precious 7 hours.

If I make it another 39 minutes, my blood carbon mono level will be normal. If I wait another 30 minutes that'll only be 9 minutes away. And that's only 15 minutes twice.

God if this is what 7 hours feels like I really don't know if I can do this.

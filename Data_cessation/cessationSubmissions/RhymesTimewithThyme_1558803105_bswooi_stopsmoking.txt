I did it!

After 3 months of smoking, I didn’t have a single one yesterday. I’m also 5 days sober from alcohol which is the longest I’ve had in a year. I just did a 1/4 mile jog which isn’t much but it was my thighs that hurt before my lungs lol, it’s a start. I used to do marathons and triathlons so I’ll get back to where I was eventually. 

I’m 29 y/o (and broke AF) and it’s a shame it took me this long to turn my life around but better late than never. And whaddaya know, I got a call yesterday setting up a job interview for Monday! Maybe I’ll actually fix my life and get my first girlfriend in 10 years, that’s the goal anyway.

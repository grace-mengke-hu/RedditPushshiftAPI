This bloat's a joke!

Hey all, my quit date is Sep 2015 but I used patches until May 17th of this year, so it's been just about two months no patch.  I'm happy about mental clarity returning from peak withdrawal, and my blood sugar seems to be stabilizing - however I keep cramping up on my right side abdomen and my digestion is suuuuper slow leading to bloating and pain...anyone have this experience this long after no nicotine and know whether it lasts a long time?

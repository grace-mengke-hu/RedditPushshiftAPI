2 weeks tomorrow.

Went cold turkey for the third time and have never lasted this long without smoking. I feel that I have really quitted smoking for sure, I've gone out drinking with smoking friends and have rejected ciggies, I can control my cravings, and everyone supports my decision. 

Thanks for your support reddit, friends, and family. I hope this time is for sure, let's keep it up!

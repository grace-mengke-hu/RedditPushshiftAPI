I miss smoking...

I've quit for the last 6 months. I don't crave it and the last 3 months of smoking it tasted like shit. But i'm back to shift work and overtime and I miss just bonding over a smoke and feeling like it's earned after long hours.. the main reason that stops me isn't health but how long it took for my happiness to come back after stopping.

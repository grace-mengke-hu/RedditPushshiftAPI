Four whole days

In the middle of what will be day five when it is over right now. I just went for it. Ran the remainder of my smokes under the sink last Wednesday night and haven't looked back. The last few days have sucked, Saturday I was either crying or about to break something most of the day, Sunday I kept running into things and dropping things. Today my mouth is swollen (wtf??). 

My support team is a godsend. My coworkers have been amazing leaving me silly pictures and throwing out high fives after shows, my roommate has been leaving tiny piles of mylar confetti around the house for me to find, my sister sends me Chuck Norris pics, my nephews send me videos telling me they are proud of me, and my mom texts me every night saying she's happy she hasn't had a call for bail money yet. 

I feel really good about where I'm at even though I feel like shit.

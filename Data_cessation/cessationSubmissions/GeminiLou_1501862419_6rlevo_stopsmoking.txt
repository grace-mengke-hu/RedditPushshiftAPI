Need some advice

I'm on day 16 not smoking,and I'm pretty proud of myself.I didn't think I could get this far after many failed quit attempts.
I know this smoker who said to me why do
 you need to quit,we are all going to die anyway.I explained to this person that I'm having breathing problems and want to be healthier overall,they don't seem to get what I was saying to them.Have any of you ever dealt with a person like this who seems to not understand there a plenty of reasons to stop smoking and how did you respond to someone like this?
I would just let it go,but I see this person all the time and they are really getting on my nerves.

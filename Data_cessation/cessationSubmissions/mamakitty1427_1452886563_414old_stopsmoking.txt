Day 1...again

Hey!

So like many of you, I've been trying to quit smoking on and off for years, but I really truly wanted to commit on New Years this year. I made it 7 days....and caved and had a cigarette. Now every day I start out the day committed to quitting but end up bumming before the end of the night. I really want to quit for good. I'm only 23 and I have so many reasons to be a non-smoker, but the cravings are so bad and I feel miserable and exhausted when I don't have a cigarette. If anyone has any advice on how to really commit to quitting or even just some good vibes to send my way I would really appreciate it!!

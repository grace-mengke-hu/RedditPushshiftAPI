secret smoker/secret quitting

I've been smoking for about 3-4 years. Hard to pinpoint an exact start time because it started with spiffs to stretch weed, turned into occasional hand rolled cigs during dry spells (2-3 a week) About a year ago it turned into a cigarette a day, then twice a day, then 4-5 a day. Somehow I've kept this almost completely a secret (everyone knows I'll smoke when I'm drunk and gf thinks I smoke a lot of cigars) I think because I really only smoke while driving 

Anyways I am going to propose to my gf this week and I don't want to go into marriage hiding anything, so I bought an ecig and am on day two of no smoking. Got the 0 nicotine juice because I kind of feel like this is still more of a digital fixation and I'd rather ditch the chem aspect

I kind of want to still let myself have a cig or two when I'm out drinking with friends, but that may be addict logic

*edit* I'm posting because I'm very extroverted and since I can't talk about this with anyone I know, I need to vent somewhere

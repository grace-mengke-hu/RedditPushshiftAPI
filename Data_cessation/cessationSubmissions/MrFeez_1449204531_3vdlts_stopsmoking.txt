I am about to smoke my last cigarette.

I'm a 30 yo man, I've smoked a half pack to a pack a day for the last 15 years. I quit last February, got into a relationship with a great girl, and then I started smoking again around this time last year and my addiction was a major factor in us breaking up. I'm not sure if we were meant to be or not, but the fact that cigarettes contributed to destroying a relationship is very sad to me.  My life is basically in shambles right now, and cigarettes play a huge factor.  I can't afford the habit, it affects my social life, and just make me feel like a failure in general.

I am about to smoke my last cigarette right now.  I just reread Allen Carr's book and I'm ready to do this.  This sub is amazing and I know you guys will help me through it.  Here we go!

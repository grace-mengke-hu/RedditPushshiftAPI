If the name fits....

It's been 2 months smoke free but this week is almost like the first week. Don't know why. Today I won't smoke because I have nothing to smoke. In the bigger picture though, I don't think I could ever get past 1 day again so 2 months is my humongous miracle. Call me Joneszey cause I've got one but I did make myself smile. I think that will get me to tomorrow

Reading Allen Carr book need help

I have been a smoker since I was 16 now I'm 29 about to turn 30 in a few months. I recently bought the Allen Carr book "Easy Way to stop smoking," and I've been reading it on and off and re-reading for a couple months now. I really want to quit and I have quit several times but it never seemed to stick. I'm married to another smoker and have two kids and stress is my biggest trigger. 
Since my husband also smokes I'm finding it difficult to get through the book bc I want us to quit together and he just doesn't seem ready. 

I know I can quit on my own but I'm having trouble as to what is the best way I can quit with this book that has helped millions of people when I can't get my smoking partner on board with it. What should I do and what is the best way to read this book to be completely smoke free? 

I've been having trouble breathing and I really want to quit before I turn 30 please help! I smoke about 10 cigarettes a day give or take since my husband and I mostly split it. I want to be healthy for my kids and myself. Should I quit before he does or keep trying to get him to read the book so we both can quit together?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

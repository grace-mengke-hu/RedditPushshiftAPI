My longest period of non-smoking - a month!

I've never before quit for this long! The longest before this episode was a week and it was hell. This time it's a month, and I'm confident to make it much much longer. And I have to thank all the main factors that helped me to quit:  

* disgust over cigs and myself!

* all the knowledge gained in last month (Thx Joel and Alen)!

* All of you fellow redditors! Thank you for all your support!

Each of these three factors was equally important and paramount for success. It was rough at a times, I almost caved 10 days into, I was not completely nicotine free for 14 days and had numerous other minor fights with my triggers, but I finally feel that any cravings I get now are much much less intense than at start. I also feel that I finally beat physical addiction since my urge to smoke can be easily controlled even when drinking beer and being with smokers outside (did that just yesterday). All in all, a huge victory in a long war which I know will last for a long time. But today is my happy day and I celebrate... :D

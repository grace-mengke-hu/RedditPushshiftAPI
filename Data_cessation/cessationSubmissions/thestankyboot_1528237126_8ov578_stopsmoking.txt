Enough compromising. Enough with the excuses. I’m all-in now.

Apologies in advance for the brain-dump...

Over the last three weeks, I’ve been trying to quit, but I haven’t truly given it my all. I got through a week, and I gave that up for some dumb excuse.

But there’s ALWAYS an excuse. My brain can always find a way to say, “well maybe just...”

So I’m finally writing this because I’m just done. Smoking is fucking gross for about a million reasons, and there’s just no way around that, no matter what my brain wants to tell me.

So I’m writing here as a commitment. I kept intentionally avoiding posting or even commenting on this sub because I didn’t want to be a fraud. 

So here I am reddit. A smoker trying to quit. Ready to give it my all.

It’s hard for me to write that because I hardly tell anyone IRL that I smoke, including my family. I don’t like needing others to get through something, but I need this community because I really have no one else, and I just haven’t been strong enough on my own. (Gawd, that’s hard to admit.)

I’m done avoiding people and situations for a habit that could literally kill me, makes me feel self-conscious about how I smell, and keeps my body and mind from functioning at a high level. 

I tore up the last of my pack and flushed them. JOIN ME! LET’S GO! FUCK CIGARETTES!!!

I havent had a smoke in about 4 days... what are these emotions?! How have you coped?!

I want to murder!! but its closer to a back and forth every 18 minutes between hate, sadness, confidence and a massive mix between the few.

Those who have gotten past the initial shitshow, what were your ways or common ways of coping? I'm definitely getting back into the gym ASAP. I'm not worried about starting to smoke again, but I really want to focus on shaking off these fucked feelings!

I have a feeling meditation and gym training is going to become far more prominent in my immediate life. But any more tactics will be greatly helpful especially in emotional stability.

Thank you all in advance...and thank yeezus for this sub. I've been lurking for months but I'm finally getting involved with what I've been wanting to do all this time.

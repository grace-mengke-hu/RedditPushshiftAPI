Day 56 - the drinking test

I successfully got sort of hammered for the first time since I quit and I did not smoke. And I had just as good of a time as I would have if I had been smoking - in fact, I had a better time because I wasn't freezing my ass off outside trying to smoke a cigarette as fast as possible.

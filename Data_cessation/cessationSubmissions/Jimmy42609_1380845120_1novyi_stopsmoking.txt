Somehow I missed my 100th day....

It's officially been 132 days since my last smoke.  Way to go me!!!!!   I've been keeping tabs on how long it's been just by the months that have past.  Never thought I would make it this long.  Advice for those thinking about quitting, just worry about getting through today and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.  We have all been in your shoes before and it sucks, but the days do get better as they go by.

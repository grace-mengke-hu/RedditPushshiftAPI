Threw my juul out the window

Been following this for about a week now. It’s nice because everytime I go on reddit I see a post about a fellow person and their story. It’s made me reconsider my addiction to nicotine. Buying a pack of pods every other day has gotten out of hand. I don’t know exactly why but I was driving today and looked at my juul and something told me to just toss it.

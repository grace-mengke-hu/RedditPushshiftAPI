Morning Autopilot: Advice on how to get around that first cigarette of the day?

A friend of mine who quit told me that once he was able to make it to noon without a cigarette he felt like quitting was easy. The thing is... without a cigarette and a cup of coffee in the morning I feel like I just can't get out of bed. It is what motivates me to finally get my ass up. Any ideas/advice on how to stop this nonsense?

You can do it too! If you really want to...

So i guess this is my "yaay 1 year post". For me it was a lot easier than i thought it would be. For me it was just about making the decision and then just never looking back. Sure I've been tempted a few times but then i just think how stupid it is to smoke. Also all the money you save...

Just keep at it one day at a time and don't trick yourself. It is a lot about willpower and just being proud of everyday you do not smoke. Time flies by.. One year went by really fast and i don't have any cravings anymore at all, actually i get quite disgusted by the smell of smoke and cigarettes. So just keep at it focus on your hobbies and just other things than cigarettes and you will make it! Happy new year to all you quitters out there!

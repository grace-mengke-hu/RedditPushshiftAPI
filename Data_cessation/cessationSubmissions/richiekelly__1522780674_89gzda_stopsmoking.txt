Today's the day

I've known I've needed to quit for a long while, but always told myself "I'll do it next week" or "I dont want to deal with the cravings" or some other excuse. This past weekend I smoked more than I usually do, and my body literally shut down yesterday because of it. My chest hurts, my body aches, and I just feel like crap (not sure if it's all because of the smoking, but I'm going to attribute it to that).

So, starting now, I'm done. Im worried about the cravings and about potentially starting again, but I'm done. Sorry for the stream of consciousness post, I just needed to get this out somewhere. Wish me luck

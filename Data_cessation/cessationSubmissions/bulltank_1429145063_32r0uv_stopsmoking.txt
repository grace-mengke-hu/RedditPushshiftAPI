Quit smoking today. Using a vaporizer (is that cheating??)

6 hours in. Got a new vaporizer with real nicotine. 

Feels great so far. I really recommend people who just cannot go more then a few hours to give it a try. Was able to pickup a legit vaporizer for about 45$ and a vial of nicotine for $6 and I'm ready to go.

Wish my luck boys!

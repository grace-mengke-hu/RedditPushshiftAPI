Today is my quit day!

I smoked a pack a day for 21 years. Its been roughly 15 hours and so far so good. I'm using 4mg nicotine lozenges and plan to taper down over the course of 6 weeks. So far I have only used 4 lozenges. Whatever number I use today I plan to use 1 less the next day. If after 6 weeks I'm not done, the nurse wants me to go on the 2mg lozenge. My work offers a  program and its all free, lozenges counseling etc.

I have to quit for medical reasons NOW so failure is not an option! I am very motivated and I have no doubts I'll get through this.

 I love reading all of your quit stories they really made me want to share too. So I'm writing to share my quit progress in the hopes it may help someone else.  Anyway, WOOO Gung Ho!!!!  Lets do this shit!!!       

p.s.  Fuck cigs!!!!

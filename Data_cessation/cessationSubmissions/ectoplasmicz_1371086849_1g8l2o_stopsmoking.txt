Im 17 and i need to stop

I started smoking when i was 15. Like a lot of people, it was a social thing. 

Its now a habit. 

I haven't thought much about it, about the possible negatives. Until just now. I'm sitting at a bus stop. About 5 minutes ago I spat out a chunk of phlegm (eugh) and there was a bit of blood in it. Its frightened me enough. 

It could just be a throat infection. It could have nothing to do with smoking. But that's besides the point. Its a kick in the arse and has made me want to stop. I'm 18 in 3 months,  and by then I want cigarettes out of my life. 

I just don't know how. I'm just looking for advice from those who have successfully quit or are in the process of quitting. 

So whats the best way to do it? I know we are all different and how someone quits will vary from person to person , but I'll try anything. I just need to get started in some form. 

Thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated. 

Thankyou

one bitch of a day

but I'm still smoke free. I lost my temper at a family breakfast and said something I probably shouldn't have, or at least should have phrased it differently. The visit went downhill from there. I'm the only smoker in my family so no one 'gets' what this is like. No one even asked 'so how's the quit going?" By the time I left I was jonesing badly, and that craving lasted the entire 2 hour ride home, all through my grocery shopping, and reached critical mass after running into an old coworker (1980's) in the parking lot who I finally had to cut short, and is just now starting to let up 3 hours later.  
Tell me again that this gets easier.

PS- my phone rang in the middle of my breakfast meltdown. I glanced at the screen- it was my quit coach from the tobacco helpline. How ironic. I didn't answer. I probably should have.

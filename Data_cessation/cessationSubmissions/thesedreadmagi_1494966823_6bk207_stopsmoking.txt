Hey y'all, day 1, reaching out for a bit of support

I feel like I'm losing it, like my brain isn't functioning properly. This is much harder than the last time I tried to quit.

I'm going to keep pushing through, but I am finding myself thinking thoughts like, what if I could smoke just one cigarette per day, at night? Or something like that.

Tell me that's a bad idea? That it's not sustainable?

Thanks.

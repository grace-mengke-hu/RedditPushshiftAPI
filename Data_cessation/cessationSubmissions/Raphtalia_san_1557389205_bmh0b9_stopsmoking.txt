The fight begins!

Hello, my name is Theresa and I’m 23 years old. I was smoking since my 16. Now I have become mother, but the first year of my son’s life I didn’t stop smoking. Few days ago I went outside and I couldn’t catch my breath. That was the time when I said to myself that it was enough. 

I don’t want that my son will see his mom as a smoker. I want that he’ll see me as someone who can inspire him for good and not to be a smoker. Together with smoking I would like to improve my living style and I would like to live more healthy. 

The prison of smoking is over and I’m gonna fight this no matter what. Now during these 4 days which I don’t smoke I realized how much time I actually spent with smoking and how much free time I have now. Sometimes it’s hard because the triggers and cravings are really tempting, but this time I’m not gonna lose over myself. 

Now the choice is not only up to me, but I will do this for my son as well. Let the fight begin!

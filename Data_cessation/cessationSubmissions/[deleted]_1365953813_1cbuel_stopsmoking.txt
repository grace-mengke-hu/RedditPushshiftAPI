I want to stop smoking tobacco, but don´t want to stop smoking weed. Do you have any advice for me?

I´m a heavy smoker since i was 14 years old and I never wanted to stop. I´m 25 years old and right now I´ve got a cold and a bad bronchitis and did not smoke for five days. I think this is the first time in years, I didn´t smoke for such a long time and I´m quite proud of me :D

My problem is that i love smoking joints and the only weed i can get is so potent that i have to mix it with tobacco. I don´t want to buy a vaporizer or smoke bong or something like that. I just want to smoke one or two joints per evening and be happy :D Do you think quitting smoking is a realistic goal when I still smoke weed/tobacco joints?

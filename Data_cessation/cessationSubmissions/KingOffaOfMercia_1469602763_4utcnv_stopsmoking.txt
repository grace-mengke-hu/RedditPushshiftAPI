Lack of cravings when quit smoking

Hi guys.

I just wanted to know if anyone else is in or has been in the same boat as me. 

I have smoked for about 7 years and have tried to quit a number of times, but every time I tried I suffered from debilitating cravings. 

However, I have recently quit( 3 days ago) due to severe chest pains and coughing up phlegm for a few months.

Here's the thing I haven't craved the cigarettes like at all. My chest still hurts when I breath and I have been coughing up more bloody phlegm. But not a single craving.

I know I should be happy with that, but on the contrary I am more worried than ever.

I feel like I might have the big C and have only just mustered up the courage to make a doctors appointment. But then again I'm only 24 so I feel extra stupid for that worry. I don't feel like I'm allowed to have that concern.

So anybody?

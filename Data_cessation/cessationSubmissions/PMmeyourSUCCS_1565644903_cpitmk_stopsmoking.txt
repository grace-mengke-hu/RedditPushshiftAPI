I need a little encouragement from others who’ve made it further, please

I’m somewhere around 2 months shy of 1 year smoke free, and holy moly I am craving a smoke like it was my first try at quitting all over again. For so long the smell was disgusting to me, it’s becoming enticing. I know this is the addict mindset and I’m not proud of it. 

For the folks who’ve been there, how the hell did you keep all of that rubbish at bay?

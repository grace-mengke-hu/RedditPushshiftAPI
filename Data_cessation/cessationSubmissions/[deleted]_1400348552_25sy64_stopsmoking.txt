Ecig experience so far.

Hello everyone!

I recently bought an electronic cigarette because i wanted to lessen the amount of cigarettes consumed per day. here's my experience with it.

I normally smoke a pack and a half per day and since my parents both smoke, it can get expensive. We make our cigarettes using [this] (https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR8fvXCG4zXg3ngDz5rW3oiXf8VrFyMKYDyullLNVF3nETdEd3lTQ)

I reduced my total amount of cigarettes per day from 20-30 to 8 in two days rarely enough, i thought it would take a while longer to lessen the amount! (i sound like an advertisement, blasts)

Anyways, i just wanted to voice my experiences!

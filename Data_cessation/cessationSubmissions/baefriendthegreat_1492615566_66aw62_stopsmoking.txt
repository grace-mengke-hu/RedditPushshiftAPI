Day two

It's day two. Day one sucked. I was incredibly pissed off all day and found myself having to apologize for stupid and pointless outbursts of anger.  
I just woke up on my second day having turned off my alarm this morning and skipping my class due to a horrible wave of both depression and anxiety (which I have without the added stress of quitting). I still feel like shit and never want to move again.  
I WILL make it through today!  
Not another puff no matter what!

My ecig feels like cheating

I am finally trying to quit for good after 6 years of on again/off again attempts. I have a mantra, I have this sub, and I have my friends. I also have my nifty ecig. But I can't shake this feeling like I'm cheating. Is using my ecig OK to help me quit? How long after I've been cigarette-free do I stop the ecig?

Edit: thank you all for your encouragement! I'll stick with the e-cig until I feel comfortable without it. This sub plus my app that tracks all the good things I'm doing by not smoking is making me feel super confident about this quitting attempt, so thank you all :)

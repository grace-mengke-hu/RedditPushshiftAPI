Day 32: I've been waking up every morning with a slightly itchy throat, as if I smoked an entire pack the night before. Normal or no?

I've noticed this for a week or two. My wife said that she hasn't had any sort of issue like I've been experiencing. 

Has this happened to anyone before or am I just going crazy?


On a side note, we went to Relay for Life and I had no shortness of breath while walking some laps! It was truly a great feeling.

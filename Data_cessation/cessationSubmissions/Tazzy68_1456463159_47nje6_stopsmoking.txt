Better than a spa treatment...NOT KIDDING!

I am a 31 year smoker and a 27 day non smoker. I still jones for a cigarette... I miss that deep first drag of calming that craving....it sucks. I have, however, noticed the benefits (yes, already, I am just as shocked) that quitting has done for my skin and my hair.  Call me vain!!  I will admit, as an American female, I have spent my fair share of dollars on skin creams, serums, facials, hair treatment, vitamins, etc.  I WAS a smoker who tried her best to counteract the horrible side affects of smoking...(fantasy!!). Than I quit...first week...it was death warmed over...I cried a lot. These last three days...WOW...maybe I finally got the smoke out of my eyes..who knows. My point smoking not only weighed me down but obviously my body was feeling it....now IT IS FREE!!!! My skin looks so different I cannot describe it and my hair it is shiny and OMG it always smells good. There are benefits that you will find and I guarantee you will be just as vain and happy as I am...at least at this moment.
Hang in there gang you will feel it, too!!

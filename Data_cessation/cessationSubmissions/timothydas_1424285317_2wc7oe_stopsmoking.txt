Sleeeeeeeepy

Hello everyone,

I became a non-smoker as of Jan 1 2015, and have a question to fellow non-smokers.
Is it normal to be much sleepier than when I used to smoke? 
I love the fact that I can fall asleep anytime I want to (Iâ€™m out like a light whenever I decide to go to bed), but it also feels like I need to sleep more in order to not feel so tired. 
I used to be fine on 6 hours of sleep per night, but now I need to sleep 8-9 hours!

Anyone else feeling this?

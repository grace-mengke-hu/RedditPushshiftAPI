6 months!

I spend most of my time on /r/stopdrinking but wanted to swing by on my way there tonight and toot my cig free horn. Oddly enough I have been getting some cravings lately but I must say the clear breathing and general lack of feeling like shit has been worth it. I'd say I was pretty much "over it" around months 2â€“3, but again, I still get random cravings. I just remind myself how nasty the relapse cig would taste and make me feel... there's no way it would be worth it, and smoking cigarettes simply hold me back from my goals. Thanks for listening SS!

When I quit, I said goodbye to cigarettes AND to my heart palpitations!

I've been quit for two months now and just noticed last night that with my cigarettes went my heart palpitations that I had been experiencing for several months. For some perspective, **I'm only 28 years old**. That is not an age at which heart palpitations should be a fucking concern.

In saying goodbye to my shitty lungs and my heart problems, I have been happy to say hello to:

- the ability to walk up a flight of stairs without gasping for breath at the top or feeling my heart race

- the ability to run a full mile without slowing to walk **and** without feeling overly winded

- the desire to go outdoors solely for physical activity instead of just to smoke

Since quitting I have run approximately 50 miles, which may not seem like much but in the year prior to quitting I had not run even one, nor had I purposely set out to exercise in any way that year.

You guys, this shit can change your life.

I was headed down a path of wheezing and feeling my heart skip beats just from walking up a flight of stairs. Chasing my 2-year-old through the yard was a chore that hurt my lungs. I was getting heart palpitations while simply sitting on the couch doing nothing. **I was going to die of a heart attack.** I know, I know...I still might. But it sure as hell isn't going to be directly caused by cigarettes. And it sure as hell isn't going to be when I'm only 28 years old.

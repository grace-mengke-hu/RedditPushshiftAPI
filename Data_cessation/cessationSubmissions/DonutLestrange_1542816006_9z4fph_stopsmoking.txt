Day 7 and I really had a hard morning.

I'm breathing better from whatever is going on today so I'm assuming that's why I feel now that I need to smoke.. it's been nagging on me all morning but I'm surviving. Trying to keep distracted. Poop. I just have to keep telling myself this is only temporary.

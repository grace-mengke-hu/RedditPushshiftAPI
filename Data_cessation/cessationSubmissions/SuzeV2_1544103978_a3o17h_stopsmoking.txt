I’ve smoked for 30 yrs-how did you guys do it?! Ugh! Gotta quit...

Started smoking in high school.  In the 30 some years of smoking I’ve had brain surgery and open heart surgery AND I still smoke!!!  To top it off I’m a nurse,  so I know the diseases that smoking can create. Damn cigarettes...  I guess my biggest question is, what did you guys do that first week of quitting when you had your routine of smoking broken up - when I get in the car-after a meal- with my coffee- after a busy day—-these are some instances  I know I’ll have a hard time——advice please..............

Shallow breathing/Trouble breathing after quitting smoking?

I haven't smoke in 2 days and now i have trouble breathing. I'm mildly athletic and don't have health problems.

This also happened last time i quit smoking and went to 2 different doctors, both said i have perfectly fine lungs and just prescribed magnesium.

Is this normal? I only started smoking this summer and i'm quitting now.

Anyone else that felt this issue?

cold turkey X3

had my last smoke monday around 5pm. told my friends as i scrubed it out that it was the last one. " thats it i quit ". one friend sayes "oya ive heard that before". And ya its true this is attempt number 6 or 7. But no matter, its not going to be a problem if i never put a cig in my mouth ever again. 
Well thats not all. I decided to quit drinking too. Its been a big problem for me and i feel i cant have one with out the other. I know from other experiences that its easy to lose control when your drunk.
Im not saying ill never have a beer with a friend or while im out camping or whatever but i dont want to get drunk ever again and thats going to be hard, maybe even harder then quiting smoking.
And if thats not enough, i quit cocain too. 3 things at the same time. 
I feel this is the best way to do it and i know i can. If i cant have the power to do what i want in my life then whats the point?
Ill just smoke a joint and order a pizza when i party from now on :D

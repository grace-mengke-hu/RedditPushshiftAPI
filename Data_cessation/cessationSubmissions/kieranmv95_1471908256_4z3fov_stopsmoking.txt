Downloaded an app and starting when I wake up :)

I have quite many times before for a matter of hours one time for about 2 weeks but I always give in, I'm going to check in here each day to see other peoples stories.
I really want to quit and one day at a time I want this to be the last time. This time I'm using no NRT because either end up failing because the second I can't use any NRT I smoke again. This time cold turkey.

Wish me luck

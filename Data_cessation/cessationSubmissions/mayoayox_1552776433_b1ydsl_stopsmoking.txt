Not a smoker, but my mom is an ex smoker...

I just want to encourage you guys. Keep at it!
My mom quit when I was 13. That was seven years ago and I occassionally still say "thanks for doing that, mom."
Its saved her time and money, but more importantly its taught me that smoking is something I should avoid at all costs. If you have kids or close loved ones, quitting might be the most loving thing you can do for them at this stage in your life. 
Good luck to each of you, and Godspeed!

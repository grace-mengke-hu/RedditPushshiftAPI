Warning: Arrogant post.

I tried three times in the last few months with patches and each time I cracked on day 3. This time, I listened to The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and something clicked. I have wanted to quit since I began smoking, but I just didn't have the tools before now. This is it and I am actually excited to battle my brain when it tries to trick me into smoking. Carr's mention of the nicotine monster that lives inside you was really interesting. I am going to starve that bitch. I would say wish me luck, but that implies that I might fail. I know I won't this time. Has The Easy Way to Stop Smoking been anyone else's answer?

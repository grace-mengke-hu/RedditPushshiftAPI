how to talk to SO about quitting?

hi all, was gonna go to r/relationships but figured this would be a better place. i quit smoking in march, had a few relapses, but going clean again. my SO, who we'll call N has been smoking for a few years. when we first met it was about 8 cigs a day, it's been cut down to 3-4. 

a few weeks ago N told me they wanted to quit. i was really excited and gave them a bunch of tea tree toothpicks that helped me quit. they used those for few weeks, and cut down to 1-2 a day. we talked about going cold turkey vs. slowing down and they said they wanted to slow down, and they were showing progress so i was fine with it.

fast forward to today. i'm back home from school and staying with N for the week, and i've noticed they're smoking 2-4 a day again. i asked if the toothpicks stopped helping and was told yes. 

i'm really upset about it and really want to talk to N about it, but i'm worried about coming across as overbearing or mom-like. i just really love them and care about them and want them to be healthy. i mentioned it today and they apologized? but idk how to have an actual conversation about it without seeming controlling. 

any advice is appreciated on what to say or how to say it. thanks all

**TLDR** my SO is smoking again after cutting back and i want to convince them to quit without seeming controlling

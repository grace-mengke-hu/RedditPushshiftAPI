11 Days and Struggling :(

Hi all, I need some encouragement. I did ok for the first week - it was hard but I was feeling strong and resolved so I was able to push through. However, the last 24 hours have been the worst! I didn't have anything happen in my personal life that would make it harder it just seemed to get really hard out of the blue, and the smokers flu symptoms are making me feel miserable. It's kind of like a break-up: I don't want it back, I didn't like it, and I know this is better for me... but I miss it and the place it had in my life. 

I use the Smoke Free app and have been using nicotine/tobacco-free herbal cigarettes for times when I just need to satisfy the ritual. Thoughts?

If only these goddamn headaches would stop

I tried quitting again four days ago. I've been on a pack/pack-and-a-half a day for eight years, and have tried quitting several times before, to varying degrees of success.

I don't remember ever having the headaches be this bad though. I'm considering smoking just to try and make them stop. I go to bed with a headache, wake up through the night with a headache, get up in the morning with a headache. All fucking day, headaches. I'm completely and utterly miserable.

I just need to moan. Anyone know a good remedy to this? Painkillers don't help, I've tried aspirin, ibuprofen and codeine to no effect (not all together, of course). I just need to hear that'll it'll pass soon!

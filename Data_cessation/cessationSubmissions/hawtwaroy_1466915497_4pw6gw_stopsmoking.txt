Reeeeeee-lapse

Started smoking again after a couple of months or so. I've got a self-destructive streak in me and carcinogens feed that. Everything was going really well and I'm like, "Hey, maybe I can try and get cancer." 


I feel so undeserving of being a non-smoker. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.

Well here we go.

Yesterday I opened what is hopefully going to be my last pack of cigarettes, and I had the last one a few hours ago.

I'm 26 and have been smoking since I was 17. Kind of quit very briefly when I was pregnant with my daughter (like the last 3 months of the pregnancy, disgusting I know - don't need to be told), but this is it. I don't know what it was about yesterday, but I just became infinitely fed up with this habit in a matter of seconds, something snapped inside me. I thought about all the money I throw away, that I could be spending on my beautiful child. All the nice things I could have. My (future) health. I just thought, screw this... and I think this time I really mean it. I *want* to quit.

I'm somewhat prepared. I bought pretzels and hard candies for the oral fixation part which i think is the big draw to smoking for me, and my boyfriend knows what I'm doing and is 100% supportive as he quit a couple years ago. Any other advice/tips? Any withdrawl symptoms I may experience?

Sorry if you guys get this a lot. I just felt like I needed to tell someone other than my boyfriend, since I keep my smoking to myself mostly, and most friends are non smokers who never smoked anyway.

I had my first cigarette today after 6 months of quitting.

I had 2 actually. I was feeling overwhelmed with this new technical school im in alongside some relationship troubles and i just said "fuck it". It was nice. I really felt how unhealthy they are, which may deter me from buying them. But im in a unique position where every dime i have is accounted for and aside from doing something criminal, there is no way ill have enough money to be a full time smoker again. $13 a pack here in NYC. How you should i be feeling about all this?

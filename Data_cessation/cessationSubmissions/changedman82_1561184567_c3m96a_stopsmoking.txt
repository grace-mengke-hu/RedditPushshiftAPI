CRAVING - FEAR - DEPRESSION

Hi everyone, I'm on the mission to understand reasons of why I smoked, I started my day 3 and I have quit many times in the past using various methods. My objective is to understand element of fear before taking decision of quitting smoking and to prove that smoking is NOT ABOUT NICOTINE.
What is the opposite emotion to fear ?
How self centered emotions stand in the way of successful quit ?

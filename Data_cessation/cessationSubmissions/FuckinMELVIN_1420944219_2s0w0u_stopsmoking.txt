Feel like death

Let me start off by saying that I get no cravings. Absolutely none whatsoever. Been a half pack a day smoker for 3 years now. As the flair suggests - - I'm 10 days clean and the psychological effects have yet to set in. Allen Carr's a true [insertyourpreferreddeityhere]send. 

The physical part of it is fucked up. My head burns by 7PM. I get crazy fever. My heart races to >100bps which is not normal for a 22 year old but gets better by night. I'm terribly weak by default, or so I just found out. Right now I have a terrible flu which I'm pretty sure is cigarette related since the feeling of weakness transcended from mild to severe headache and eventually a flu only a day after I quit. I'm never touching those cancer sticks again.

How often does this happen to quitters? When does this get better? My university starts tomorrow and here I am, down with a 102 fever and not getting any sleep. Any advice, help?

Edit : I'm not looking to substitute reddit for a visit to the doctor. I'm just  curious as to if such a thing happens to every new quitter or is it different for everybody.

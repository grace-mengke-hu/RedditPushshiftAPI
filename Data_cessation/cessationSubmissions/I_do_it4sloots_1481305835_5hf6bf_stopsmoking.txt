Self esteem destroyed from quitting?

So Ive used patches this time for 2 weeks and now went cold turkey in the last two days. Were already feeling like shit but now even worse. Im normally a horrible shy and unfriendly person with an aura of repulsion around him. Will the low self esteem get fixed in the next days or do I need to smoke again? Weekend is coming and without cigs I'll suffer double because it always reminds me what a pathetic lonely subhuman I am

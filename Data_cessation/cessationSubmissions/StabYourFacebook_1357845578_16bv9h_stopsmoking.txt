Hey guys, I know this gets posted all damn day. But I am done. I've finally had it with these shit sticks!

I'd been planning on building up the courage for awhile. But last night was the last straw. I am quitting both smoking and heroin at the same time. I am getting rid of everything I have left from both today, and cannot wait to look towards a brighter future. Heroin is completely controlling my life as well as smoking always being on the back of my mind whenever I do anything. I brought up the courage to tell my mother last night, even though I was really planning not too for worrying about how big a failure I would feel if I relapsed. (Smoking that is, I couldn't break it to my mother I've been addicted to heroin for almost a year. It would destroy her much like it is me.) Then I realized that maybe the thought of someone I love know I was quitting might actually help since I am so worried about letting them down more than I already have. 

This is more to get it all off my chest. I didn't realize how good it feels even to be typing this out. It's kinda like a place to tell my deepest secrets and not get judged. I didn't make a novelty for this because I want to be able to look back on it in the future. This isn't a bullshit post or some made up lie to attract attention. Hell I don't care if no one reads this. It just feels so nice to let all this out and have it permanently in writing for anyone (who chooses too) to see. You guys are great and I look forward to giving an update in this post about a week from now on how everything went. I would say wish me luck, but I am so certain and ready for change I'm praying I don't need luck just strong will. I realize how rough this will be as I've tried to get off both before. But today is the day, MY DAY.

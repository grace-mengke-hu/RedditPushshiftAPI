How long until things start coming up?

Smoked 20 years, haven't been this long without a cig since 2006, wondering how long until the lungs start sending all that baked on crappy goodness out?

*edit, took last puff just as the clock rang midnight. Want to buy smokes very badly, but don't want to fuck up 2015, if that makes any sense

Third time lucky

Last year I quit twice, each for about two months and ultimately unsuccessfully. This year the coughing and low level of fitness got to me again and on my birthday in February I smoked my last cigarette.
My friends still smoke, my partner still smokes, I still go to my regular bar where everyone smokes but I havenâ€™t once had the desire to smoke again.
I feel so much healthier and generally happier and I am sure this will be my final quit!

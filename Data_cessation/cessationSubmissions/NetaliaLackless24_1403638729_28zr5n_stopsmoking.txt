43 days and had a small issue this morning

Had a bit of a coughing fit and coughed up some stuff deep in my lung, tasted like ash/ass and threw up. Now, this happened to my friend a few days after quitting around the same time. He said he was coughing up stuff as his lungs cleaned themselves out and accidentally swallows it and ended up through up some black stuff. 


My mouth still kind of tastes terrible (like an ashtray). Any of you guys have similar experiences? Specifically at about this time past quitting?


Thanks!

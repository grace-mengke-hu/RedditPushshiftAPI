Day 1 of a long road ahead!

Hello everyone! 

So I've been lurking this subreddit for quite some time now however never really contributed because I wasn't ready to quit. Until now. 

This morning after my ritual morning cigarette I felt horrible! I gagged on my cigarette which caused my stomach to turn. Really horrible experience. And it sort of clicked. I think I've built up enough strength this time around to give this an opportunity to improve my lifestyle. 

I just wanted to introduce myself and start posting here to help motivate myself for those challenging days ahead. Looking forward for the future!

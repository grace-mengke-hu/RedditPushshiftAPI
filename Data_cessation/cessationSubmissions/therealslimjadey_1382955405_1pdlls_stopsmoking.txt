One week & two days in

Hi Everyone!

After a fifteen year adventure with tobacco and various failed quit attempts, I am now one week and two days in to what is hopefully my final quit. Surprisingly the first few days wern't half as bad as I had expected it to be but the psychological side effects are really frustrating because I feel like could honestly rip someone's throat out for a cigarette! 

Please tell me that this feeling diminishes over time because it's honestly getting me down! Any tips on how to shake that horrible feeling? I've been trying to do the usual tips like deep breathing, distraction, etc but it doesn't seem to help at all.

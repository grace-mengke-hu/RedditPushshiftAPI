Day 3...and I'm not doing too bad!

So this is day 3, and I'm using Wellbutrin to quit, and I have to say that it is helping me to control the cravings really well so far! This isn't the first time I've quit. With cold turkey, I would have been a raving lunatic right about now, ready to kill anyone that got on my bad side. Yeah, even with the Wellbutrin, I still get cravings, but now it's more like: "I wouldn't mind having a smoke, but.....meh.......I don't need it" and the craving passes! This is only day 3. Let's keep it going!

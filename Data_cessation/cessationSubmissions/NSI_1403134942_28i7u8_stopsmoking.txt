So, I've entered the magical 72 hours. Some thoughts

I'm just posting some things I've noticed about the first three days of being smoke free.  I quit three days ago because I just didn't want to buy another pack, I need my money and it also is a silly thing for a runner to do.  Some of the other reasons were vanity, I have noticed a tiny amount of discoloration on my teeth starting.  I also don't want to ruin my skin at such a young age.  

Just a bit of background on my smoking habit, I've been smoking for four years.  I have about five cigarettes a day, sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less.  Some of this is going to be TMI, sorry

The good:

* I haven't taken an aspirin in the entire three days (this is normally a daily thing for me)
* I have so much more energy esp. in the afternoon when I used to get 'crashes' around 3 pm or so
* I'm saving a little money
* My running has very slightly improved (not a lot)
* Quitting has been a *lot* easier than I thought it would be. (I was nearly having panic attacks about it before I started)
* I generally just feel better, more awake.
* This one's probably more info than anyone needs, but it is easily the most profound change for me; my libido!  Holy crap my drive is through the roof.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing. I am already in a dead bedroom marriage and it's not b/c of me.  So, though this is a nice side effect, it's also a sort of cruel one.


The not as good:

* I have to be honest; I'm worried about how long I'll stick to this.  It was easier than I thought it would be and I miss it in certain instances.  My husband is still a smoker and i enjoyed sitting out on our back patio together, and other social situations.
* Will I ever poop again?  Seriously, this is making me crazy.
* Before I quit, I was smoking about five rolled cigs a day.  So, I bought a $25 AUD pouch of tobacco every two weeks.  Not really a lot.  
* My skin hasn't really cleared up. 
* My running really isn't a whole lot better.
* I'm sleeping like crap. Very restless nights.

This is going to be very hard with my husband still smoking, but I don't want to be one of those people that just expects everyone around them to quit just because they did and then get all preachy about it.  I made this decision on my own and he can do the same.  I don't want to be one of those couple where one is always hiding that they are smoking from their partner.  I have quite a few friends like that.

Anyway, These were just some thoughts I had this morning as I reach day three and I'm just being honest about how I feel.

As always, words of wisdom and advice are appreciated, stay strong, my friends.

Small edit: I know my badge says two days, but I'm a day later down here in Australia.

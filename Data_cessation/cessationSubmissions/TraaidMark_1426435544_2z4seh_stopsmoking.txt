My flair says 51 days!

I don't think about smoking at all. I consider myself a non-smoker. It doesn't bother me when people smoke around me at all.

I sometimes want to smoke, but that's purely a head thing - like, I am sitting on the porch, having a beer watching the sun go down, and a smoke would be nice. But I don't give it much thought.

I do believe I might have won!

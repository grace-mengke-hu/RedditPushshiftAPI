Got a badge, 3 days without smoking

I thought it would be meaningless, but it's kind of helpful to look over at my name and see that I haven't had a smoke in 3 days now. I'm starting to cough up some of the gunk in my lungs from the last few months since my previous quit attempt. But a the same time I feel better than I did 3 days ago (minus the nic fitting every once in a while). This time around it's not quite as bad as I remember it being.

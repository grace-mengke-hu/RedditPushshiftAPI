10 days in

I spontaneously quit on March 1st, using the patch to get through the first few days.  It is March 10th and I am smoke free !!!! I had 3 cigs in the whole ten days, all in the first 3 days, more bc I convinced myself I wanted them.   Extinction burst!  They were all disgusting, maybe the patch helped them not be satisfying to me.  I got super busy at work yesterday, forgot to put on one, and didn't think about it until about 830 pm! So I went all day w/o the patch yesterday and no cig and barely any cravings. 

A user here linked me to an amazing website http://whyquit.com/ffn/ and reading this has really helped to understand nicotine and why this can be so hard, I wanted to share in case any one else needs it.

I am so relieved. I was afraid I would never be able to quit.  I hope I keep building on these 10 days.  I think I'll try to finish the patch program though, because I want this to stick.

Today marked 31 days without cigarettes

I've been using a juul, which I know many on here would consider cheating. But this is the longest I've gone without smoking in at least a couple years, so I still consider it quite good. This is the first time that I really feel I don't want to smoke again. Here's hoping for the best.

Less stressed than if I was smoking

So I'm 14 days smoke free today and so proud of myself, was a packet a day (sometimes more) smoker for 7 years.
I've found that I'm actually less stressed after quitting, I think it's because mentally I know if I get stressed/upset, I will end up reaching for the cigarettes and it's not worth it over a little wobble, was wondering if anyone else can relate? 

Also has anyone else experienced bleeding gums after giving up? My gums started to bleed a little yesterday but hoping it won't last too long *fingers crossed*

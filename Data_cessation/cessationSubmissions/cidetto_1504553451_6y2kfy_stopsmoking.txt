Irritability after 2 weeks

2 quite decent weeks after quitting cold turkey, today I got really angry and irritable all of a sudden. My state lasted for some 15 long and painful minutes and it's rather surprising that I didn't cave in. I fear such times of crisis since they seem unpredictable and overwhelming. Any advice though?

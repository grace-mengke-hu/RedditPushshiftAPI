Going crazy on day 53

Noone ever tells you how hard it is to quit. And when I try to explain to nonsmokers they just dont get it. If you're planning to quit. I strongly suggest psyching yourself up and having a support group ready who know the worst scenario, because this is what happened to me:

Took sick leaves the first weeks because quitting triggered my migraines and threw me in a depressed slump.

Social anxiety is through the roof (I've been avoiding all of my friends since like week 3). I'd already been coping better the past few years but now it feels like I'm back to square one. I stutter when I talk now, too.

I'm a pretty big drinker, but I lost all will to drink when I quit, so maybe I'm withdrawing from that too.

I love my job, but have felt super demotivated at everything (including hobbies) since and am having a hard time concentrating at work and my productivity is at a snail's pace.

One of my greatest motivators to not relapse is not wanting to go through this rollercoaster again. Sorry for the rant. I just feel like I'm going insane. Seriously, you think the hardest thing's gonna be the cravings but it's everything but. Jesus.

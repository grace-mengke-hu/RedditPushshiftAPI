Accidentally quit, now afraid to leave the house

I never smoked a lot, maybe 2 packs a week, but recently had to stay home for a full day. Couldn't go out to buy more. Next day didn't have the money, but still not missing them. Actually, as long as I stay in the house, I don't really miss them. But I know if I step outside I will go directly to the store and buy more and start again. As long as I don't go anyplace I'm ok. But I'm trapped in the house and literally afraid to go outside, even to the grocery store. I'm on day 3. Not sure what to do.

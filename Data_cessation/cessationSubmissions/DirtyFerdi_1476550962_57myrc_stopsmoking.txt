I feel really close to breaking

I smoked about a pack a week for the past 10 years. So not as heavy as some but still, enough to do some damage. I have had 2 cigarettes in the last almost month. I have used a vape pen to stop, and had nicotine in it for the first couple of weeks then switched off. I have felt good about it the whole time. I have certainly have cravings and successfully worked through them. Today (and yesterday... Okay it's been a growing thought for the last week or so) though for some reason I REALLY want it and am feeling like I don't care if I smoke or not. 

I have always heard and believe that you have to want to quit in order for it to stick. I want (or wanted?) to quit. I know it's the healthier choice. I just love smoking so much. I feel up until this point even through the cravings, I still wanted to quit badly enough I was staying strong.

I guess I am posting this to hopefully receive some encouragement or advice. I feel very close to going out and buying a pack.

Anyone in the UK keep failing Co2 reading checks at the stop smoking clinics?

I have not had a ciggarette for 6 weeks and every week bar one i have had over 7 when it should be around 2 or even better 0, 20 mins ago i just blew 14!! FOURTEEN!

I feel so embaressed and what else can i do but tell them i have not smoked, its really aggrivating me, i dont want to smoke, i am sick of craving it all the time,
6 weeks i have done brilliant but every week this failing test knocks me back, 

Has anyone else had similar problems? 

The boiler was serviced last month, no/one else near me smokes, thats all they said it could be. 

I am frustrated!!

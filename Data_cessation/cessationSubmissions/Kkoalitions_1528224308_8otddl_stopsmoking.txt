Need some advice...

I've  been having a really good run of it these last few weeks, feeling all good and looking forward to never going back. Only problem is, I soon need to go back into smoking social circles, out of which i can't get out of (work, family, etc). Every time in the past I failed was with these people. Any pointers or advice to help me out?

I'm gonna quit quitting

I am so tired of quitting, this has to be the last time! 

It's going to be tough, 6 out of 7 of my flatmates smoke, all of my work colleagues smoke..but fuck it, I don't want to smoke anymore.

I want to be healthy, I want to stop worrying about having a cigarette at work, about having bad breath, stinky clothes, no money ecc...

Good Luck to anyone else quitting today, not one more puff!

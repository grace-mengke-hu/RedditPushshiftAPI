3 Weeks!

So it's been 3 weeks since I had my last cig and I know this is now my new life. I honestly could not be happier. Here are some of the best things I've experienced.
-I can really enjoy food. My sense of smell is really strong and food, wine, tea, etc. just taste so damn good. I also care about what I'm eating now and not shoveling food down my gullet as quickly as possible so I can have my next smoke. And when I have a nice meal it's such a good experience.
-I can exercise once again. I am actually loosing weight, not gaining as so many people experience when they quit. I'm looking so much better.
-Socializing is so much better. I smell good. I look so much better. I'm confident. I feel like a strong person. 
-I am so much better able to focus. I'm doing better at work because I can pay attention and deal with demands without thinking about a cigaretter.
-Stress is so much easier to deal with. As you're forced to cope with stress without the aide of smoking you quickly learn to manage stress using only your thoughts. At least that's true for me.
-I have more time for everything. I don't spend any time going out for cigarettes.
-I also don't need as much sleep and I have way more energy on the less amount of sleep. So right there I get a couple more hours each day and I can enjoy them more.
-I can finally relax and enjoy being in a moment and it's amazing. I feel so damn good about myself. I'm high fiving myself in my mind right now.

Are you ever ready?

Should a person be mentally prepared for quitting?
This is a bit of a debate I’ve noticed with some encouraging random quits and others empathising the importance of a quit date. 

But here’s the thing, when you’re smoking you’re smoking you never feel truly ‘ready’ because heck, for one you’re in the centre of addiction and second you’ve no idea what’s to come yet. 

So, is quitting something that can be dived into on a whim and taken one step at a time? 
What’s your guys strategy? I’d love to hear it

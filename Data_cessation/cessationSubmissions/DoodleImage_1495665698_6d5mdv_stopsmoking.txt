Help me quit, please.

So I'm 20 years old and I guess I am kind of addicted to smoking. I am currently studying  computer science and it's really tough to stay sane especially during exams. Everytime I smoke a cigarette I feel like I'm temporarily relieved from all the stress, but because of my poor nutirion (not eating properly/enough) this thing led to gastritis. I started to go to the gym and eat properly but I still feel like shit. What tips can you give me in order to help me quit, I've tried a lot of times but usually after 4-5 days I smoked again. It doesn't feel like I am completely addicted to smoking, I feel that I cand do it but something holds me back. This is why I'm asking for your help, guys.

Thanks in advance!

Every night I promise myself I'll quit, every morning I make up excuses and cave.

I've (30m) been smoking for about 13 years, and have only ever quit for max 3 months maybe three times. My wife works in healthcare with people suffering from smoking related illness, obviously this gives me plenty of reason to quit, but for, literally, the life of me I can't kick it. I need advice for taking the initial plunge, and how to keep it up.

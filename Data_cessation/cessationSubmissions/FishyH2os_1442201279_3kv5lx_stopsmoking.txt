today, tomorrow, and the next day ect...

i want my breath to not smell. i want to exhale without hearing a slight wheeze coming from my lungs. i want to do simple activities with out heavy breathing. i want to save some money. i want to deal with stress in more healthy manner. today i smash my last filter and take the lighter out of my pocket.

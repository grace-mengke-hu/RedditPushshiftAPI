Quitting vaping

Hey guys i just recently stopped vaping ecigs 2 days ago with 3mg of nicotine, i am going cold turkey but before i did this i would slowly take 1 or 2 puffs a day when i felt i needed it and i did this for a week. Then now i am up to 2 days without nicotine, i have done this before but the withdrawal was so bad that i went back to vaping. Around this time i dont feel it as much when i withdrew from the nicotine, i have a slight headache and i can tell my brain is craving it. Do you guys have any suggestions to help me out since i am going cold turkey?

With your help...

...I had my last cigarette on the first of September.  I didn't quit because I was at the end of a box, I still have some.  Just haven't touched them.

I have been lurking on here for a while, and I wanted to say thanks for the motivation.

I'll tell ya, quitting smoking is easier (2nd time quitting) this time.... It's harder (for me) to quit caffeine... I'm doing both at once, and I tell you it sucks majorly.

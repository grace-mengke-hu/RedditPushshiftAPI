Any advice for those cigarette cravings due to associations?

A little background, I'm 21 and have been smoking since I was 14. I am a singer and songwriter (as a hobby) and realized that if I want to continue I need to kick this habit I've had for a 1/3 of my life (along w/health, money, etc reasons)
I haven't completely cut out cigarettes, but have cut down to 4-7 a day (from a pack/day) with help from e-cigs. Those 4-7 are what I've been calling my "association cigs" As in, I'm smoking those when I'm drinking coffee, driving, or drinking alcohol. I don't know how to break these strong ties I've formed with the cancer sticks, and the e-cigs jut don't make up for a real one for me. Any advice? How did you guys give up these mental bonds???

11 days smoke free and my fingernails need help!

I've always been a habitual nail biter. I quit 11 days ago and my nail biting has been getting worse - to the point my nail beds are starting to feel sore. Any advice on how to stop the fidgety habit?? I imagine that's why I smoked so long, just the habit of putting something towards my mouth whether it be fingernails, smokes, etc. How do you stop that habit entirely??

I've quit again and again...this time I'm doing it for real

For the past several months I've been trying to quit smoking. Ive quit before, but started up again. This time I am very determined to stop. I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and even have posted before, but I want this time to be for real. Fourteen years of damaging my body is enough.

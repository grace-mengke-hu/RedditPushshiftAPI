[my resume and struggle]

I Started to smoke in 2010, wanted to quit in 2013 .. the streak lasted only 2 months 

Smoked from 2013 to 2015 , quit for a year a half 
started again in 2017 , quit for two months 

smoked until 2018 Aug


been a month, i want to go on never take up a cig again in life 


and cold turkey always helps, 

Why i go back to smoking is mostly the dark thoughts and pressure and struggle i face and sometime i snap and give in

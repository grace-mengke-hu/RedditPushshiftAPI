No Control or Full Control - The Quest for No Cravings

I went to a few weddings and concerts this past summer. I smoked a ton at these events. Some thought about my incessant cravings, or nights like these, was one of the major driving factors to me quitting a few months ago. All bad things about smoking aside, the fact that I couldn't cure my cravings, the fact that I needed to go outside every 10-30 minutes was insane. I was never OK, I never had enough. It was stupid, and in the opinion of a friend who didn't smoke, quite disgusting. 


This past Saturday night I found myself drunk, hanging around smokers. Nothing new, I drink every weekend and am one of the very few people in the group who don't smoke. I have a buddy who recently quit as well. However he has had his moments when drunk. On this night he caved to the cravings. I found myself thinking "man I'm sick of this, maybe I should just go have a couple drags or just smoke one". Whats the big deal? I stayed strong, brushed it off. Then I saw him go for another. And another. And another. Then I had one of those moments looking at him smoking more than everyone else. There's no relief. The only way to reach zero cravings is to never smoke at all. I can't be a social smoker. I still have cravings here on day 146. I still would rather smoke. But its getting better. If anyone has any better ideas on how to get zero cravings I'm all ears. But as far as I can tell, I'm going to have cravings either way. If I don't smoke, I'll have less and less of them as time goes on. And hopefully one day, I won't crave at all. We'll see...

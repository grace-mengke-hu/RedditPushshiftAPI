Exactly 3 weeks! Talk to me, people, i'm sad, struggling, and wanting to give up.

first 3 weeks has had its ups and downs, but i've pretty much been on top of the worst of it. besides having made it a goal for 2017 to quit smoking, i was further motivated to quit when i was offered an employment opportunity in mid-January by an employer whose policy renders ineligible any applicant using nicotine in any form.

i interviewed on Jan 16. i quit cold-turkey on Jan. 18. i gave my 2-week notice on 1/27. it's been exactly 21 days nicotine free.

the day after tomorrow is my last working day. on monday i will have my pre-employment physical. i will undergo drug and nicotine testing. i have every reason to believe that i'll test clean, given my efforts for the past several weeks.

but here's the thing: i'm sad because i'll be missing my babies and families. i'm not just leaving "the job", i'm also leaving my littles. some of these guys have been with me since they were 3 or 4 months old.

oh, if i stay with my littles, i don't have to quit smoking...

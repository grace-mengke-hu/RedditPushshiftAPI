My wife had a bad dream:

In it, she was in a room of some sort (possibly an elevator) with another man who she thought was me. But then she could smell that it was a smoker, so it **couldn't** be me, and it frightened her.

I'm sorry she was frightened, but hot damn! It's nice to be thought of that way.  My best to all you fellow quitters; it's nice to be nicotine and smoke free in so many ways, some of them quite unexpectedly.

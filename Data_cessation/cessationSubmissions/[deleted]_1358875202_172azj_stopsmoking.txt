Decided to quit, smoked my last one last night. Any advice for the rest of this week?

As I said, smoked my last cigarette last night. Most of the advice I've read from actual websites are essentially ways to prevent relapse, but I don't think that will happen. Can you guys give me some advice on how to deal with cravings/any withdrawal symptoms?

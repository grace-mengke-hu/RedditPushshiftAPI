Day 2

Hey there all,

Glad I found this sub. I decided to kick this habit on Sunday, so it's been a rough 2 days so far. I'll admit after sunday night I lasted about 27 hours without having one until I got to work Monday night, as I work in heavy construction of course everyone smokes. I was trying to switch to chewing tobacco instead but felt like that's cheating so cut them both out completely. I lasted approximately another 27 hours before having another one (again while at work) on Tuesday night. I will admit I'm genuinely pissed at myself for these two little lapses and feel like I'm starting back at zero for each one. At least I haven't bought a pack since I threw mine out on Sunday, small victories right? I can definitely feel the mood swings and cravings full force from time to time but for the most part I'd say it hasn't been too crazy....yet. Anyway what tactics do you all use to keep your hands and mouths busy in the first few days/weeks?

Just smoked my last one, not gonna buy another pack if my life depends on it.

Came to China where everyone smokes and slowly got into it, mostly just socially and with my gf. I said if I ever caught myself thinking "I need a cigarette" I'd quit, and here I am. 

Making this post mainly for motivation, and to commit to it more. It's so easy to tell myself I'm not addicted and I just like the feeling, but that's not true anymore.

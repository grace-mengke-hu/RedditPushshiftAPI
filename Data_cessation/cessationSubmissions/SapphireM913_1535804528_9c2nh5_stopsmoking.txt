Today is 1 month.

I didn't think I'd ever see this point. I honestly didn't. I also don't think I'll see 2 months. Mostly because I don't have any sort of a plan or vision for my life but that's another story. 

Today I get to buy tickets to a small concert I want to see as a reward. 

I wonder why it doesn't feel like a month. And in that vein, where the last month went. I went to work, I ate, I slept (sort of), I showered. I know that. But I honestly cannot remember anything else that happened. Did I visit my nephew? Did I go on a date? Did I make promises I don't remember and as such cannot keep? This has been the longest month that was gone in the blink of an eye. I'm in this weird limbo where I don't remember being a smoker but I also don't think I'll ever be a non-smoker.

Is any of this normal? I already know I don't identify with the people who say "cigarettes are gross" "I'm looking up pictures of cancer to motivate myself" "Alan Carr forever". Not to impune you if you're one of them, you do you, we all fight this battle differently. But I know there's a handful of people out there that are in the same boat as me, hopefully that have reached and passed their month point, that can provide some insight.

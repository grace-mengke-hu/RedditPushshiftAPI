Hit a big milestone today. I stopped with cigarettes and the e-cig cold turkey. There were many times I almost caved in and smoked but thankfully I resisted. I picked up a pack about 5 months ago but before I even opened them I threw them away. I still get cravings but they get easier. Stay strong!

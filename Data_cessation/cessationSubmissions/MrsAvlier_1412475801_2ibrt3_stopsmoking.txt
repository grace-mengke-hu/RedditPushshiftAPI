Minute two.

This is it! I have finally decided to stop smoking. 

I had a health scare a couple weeks back. It turns out that it was a gallbladder attack, but the pain of it made me suicidal (yes, I have some ongoing mental health issues as well). Anyway, while I was in hospital for the gallbladder attack (no surgery yet, as I am still far too inflamed), I decided that I needed to make some serious changes in my life. 

I just extinguished my last cigarette. While smoking it, I noticed how gross it tasted. I savoured it, but I don't feel sad or desperate.

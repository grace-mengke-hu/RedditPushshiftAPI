Smelling Things is Awesome

In most subreddits, that title would need more context.

Here, it doesn't.

I forgot what smelling nuanced smells was like...and guys, it's truly amazing. I swear it feels like that sensation of stepping foot in a new city/place for the first time. That somewhat childlike wonder and observance of typically mundane things.

And this is just me standing on the side of a suburban NJ highway waiting for a bus at dusk! 

Little wins, I guess.

For anyone wondering or giving quitting a try... Two weeks is so very nice. Not easy by any stretch, but little gifts like renewed smells start slowly paying off the hard work from that initial pain investment of quitting.

Sorry for the shitpost. Love you all in the fight. Can't thank you enough.

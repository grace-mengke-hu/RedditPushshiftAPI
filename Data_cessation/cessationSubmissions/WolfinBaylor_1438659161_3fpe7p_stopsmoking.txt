I'm taking the plunge!

Hey all, long time lurker and now ex-smoker. About 10 years ago I went to Germany for a year in exchange and started smoking. It really was to fit in with my bf at the time and it gave us something to bond over. Well, I returned home and kept smoking, in secret from my parents. Soon I went off to college and found a group of friends that smoked just like I did. I would wake myself up at night coughing, started over-eating, and felt the constant need for nicotine. This kept going on for about 5 years and then it happened. I met my fiancee. We started dating for a while and they never made me feel bad for smoking. Well my birthday came last may, I did something I never did before, and looked at my life and future with my fiancee. I hated who was in the mirror. I had gained 100 lbs, started breathing really hard after going up stairs, and got really depressed... So I decided to do something crazy! I joined a crossfit gym, started eating better, and finally quit smoking 16 looooooong days ago. I was finally inspired to quit smoking after lurking here. I feel better than I have been for the last 10 years. I want to have a long life with my fiancee. Thank you for reading my story and I value your future support for when I reach my 1 year.

Smoker's phlegm: It's disgusting.

After my last run, I decided on a whim that I wasn't going to cough all that mucus build-up into the sink and let it go to waste. So, I gathered it on a note card and let it dry. [Here's what remained on that card.](http://imgur.com/i1mt15y) (The lines are spaced 5mm apart)

I don't have a cold. This is what leaves my body every morning. It shows that smoking literally clogs up your lungs with gunk. I'd love to have it all gone right now, but I know it'll probably keep coming for several months. 

If you're having trouble with black/brown phlegm, I recommend you adopt a morning jog routine. I cough ap a lot more gunk on mornings when I run, than on mornings when I don't, so I guess it really helps clean up my lungs (as well as improve them overall, of course, smoker or not).

Edit: For future reference, this is day 35 after smoking cessation.

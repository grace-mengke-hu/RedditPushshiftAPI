Day 3 of zyban

I took it once before to quit smoking and it worked. Stupidly I thought I could just have a drag of a cigarette. Now I am taking it again and praying it works. My anxiety is through the roof and I hope that this icky feeling will be worth it in a weeks time. Please wish me luck. I want my life back. Without cigarettes I was happy. I exercised.

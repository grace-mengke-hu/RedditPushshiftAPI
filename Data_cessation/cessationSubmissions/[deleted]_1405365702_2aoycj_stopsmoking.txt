A question and a thank you.

Firstly, thanks to all my fellow redditors on here who helped me discover Allen Carr. I bought his book about a week ago and I am now on day 2 of no smoking. 

However, I need to know -- is it bad like this for very long? I feel like complete shit, and I keep reading posts from people several months into their quit who are still struggling. I have to be honest, if I have to feel this way for that long, I'm not sure I can make it. Any help is appreciated, and thanks again to all!

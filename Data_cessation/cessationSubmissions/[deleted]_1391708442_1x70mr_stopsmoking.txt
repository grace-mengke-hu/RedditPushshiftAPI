Five weeks smoke free and feeling awesome!

Hey, r/stopsmoking, I had envied a lot of you guys for the year I've been lurking reddit. I'm 21 years old and had smoked since I was 14. In a conversation with my girlfriend I had said "Yeah, I've smoked a third of my life already". And that hit me harder than anything had before. I tossed my packs on the 30th of December and bought an e-cigarette (Which, if you haven't tried yet, helped me tremendously). It removed my habit of smoking a whole cigarette and got me to taking only a couple puffs. I then lost the e cigarette and have gone cold turkey from here on out.

I just wanted to thank you guys on this sub. Here's to being better! Cheers

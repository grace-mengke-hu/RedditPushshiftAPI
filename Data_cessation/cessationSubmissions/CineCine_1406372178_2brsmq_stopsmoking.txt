How do you cope when you live in a place where people smoke in bars?

9 days smoke-free! I went on vacation and used the change of pace to start the patch and the occasional gum when I'm really craving.

Now  back home where people smoke in bars. Last time I quit, this was my greatest weakness. My reasoning was always, "even if I'm not smoking, I'm smoking secondhand anyway. So why not pick the side that's actually enjoyable?"

How have people coped with this? I can't give up drinking as well!  I also drank a lot without smoking when I was away ... So I'm not scared of that causing me to relapse.

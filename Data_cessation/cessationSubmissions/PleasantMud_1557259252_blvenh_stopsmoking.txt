Things to do instead of smoking

Hi guys. I need your help. 

I'm going to give the 'quit smoking' thing another go. It's probably a bit easier at the moment because I have no major social event looming and I am also broke and probably can't afford to buy the damn things anyway (but it's amazing, even when on the dole, I have managed to keep buying them). 

I'm just worried about the ''void'' - basically, I use cigarettes to break up my day as a kind of treat, reward or just to medicate. I know the fact that they reduce stress is basically codswallop, but without them, I do find that I am stressed, as I go through the mental gymnastics of to have or not to have one, bargaining, ''okay, just one more day'', ''I still look good, I don't need to stop'' etc etc etc.

All of that stuff will probably still happen. All my insides will scream at me. I basically just want other things to keep me going, some other 'rewards' and things to look forward to.

Isn't it sad that I think that without smoking, I will have nothing to look forward to?! How has my brain come up with that gem? For fuck sake!

So, please, any suggestions here would be great, they can be small or big, with preferably a few things that I can do daily/weekly in there, so I can start the battle once more with more armour and weapons to fight that nasty bastard in my head.

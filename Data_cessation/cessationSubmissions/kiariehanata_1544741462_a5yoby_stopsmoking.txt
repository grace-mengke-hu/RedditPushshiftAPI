I quit 2 minutes ago

Yesterday I said I would quit when I ran out. I just finished my last one a few minutes ago. 

This is attempt #3. The first one lasted almost 5 years after roughly 6 months of smoking. The second lasted 2 weeks after a year of smoking. 

I know why the second one failed so quickly and I fear it will happen again, so I thought I'd turn to a support community. The reason I failed last was because my SO caved, so I caved with him. This time, he's not quitting. It's just me. (So vapes, I'm picky about flavors and decided quitting all together would be easier.)

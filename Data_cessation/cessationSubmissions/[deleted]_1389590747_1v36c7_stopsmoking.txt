Caution - Cranberry Juice

Cranberry juice is suggested by some websites as being helpful for speeding up the elimination of nicotine from the body during withdrawal. Just a note of caution, I ended up in hospital last week with low platelets. After the process of elimination the Drs suspect drinking cranberry juice to be the cause of my playlet count drop. Apparently some individuals (lucky me included) can have a sensitivity to cranberry juice. If you drink cranberry juice regularly and start to excessively bruise, a trip to the DR would be advised

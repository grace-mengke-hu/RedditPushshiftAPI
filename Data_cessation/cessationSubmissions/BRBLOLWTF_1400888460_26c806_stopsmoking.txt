What if i dont want to?

Ok I really am aware of how unhealthy smoking is for me and how much damage I'm doing to my body, but what if I don't want to quit? I enjoy smoking. I enjoy smoking after eating a fulfilling meal, I enjoy smoking while driving, I enjoy smoking while having a drink and I enjoy it in many other situations. I don't want to quit because I genuinely enjoy every puff I take. My throat has bee hurting a lot in the past week but that didn't stop me! Can someone help me? Tell me what I can do to overcome this bittersweet addiction!!!  In other words, Convince me to stop smoking!

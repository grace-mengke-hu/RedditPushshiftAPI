For anyone who uses/has used nicotine patches, if you could answer some questions for me, I'd appreciate it!

I don't smoke, but I do have narcolepsy and I'm looking into using nicotine patches for treatment (yes, I'm serious).

Without getting into too much detail, narcolepsy is caused by a lack of hypocretin in your brain, which is a tiny protein that regulates sleep cycles. About 63% of narcoleptics smoke, compared to the 19% of the general population that does. This is because hypocretin and nicotine are almost interchangeable, as found by a study in 2005. Nicotine does wonders in fending off attacks and making narcoleptics feel well rested, so basically it keeps the two most inconvenient symptoms at bay. It's also harder to quit because symptoms come back from the lack of nicotine.

When I looked into this, I found nothing but success stories from everyone who tried this treatment method. The medicine I'm on currently does nothing for me except making me have seizures, so at this point I'd sure as hell rather be on nicotine, something that works, whether it's addictive or has side effects or what-have-you. I need something that helps me, even if just a little bit, because I'm honestly running out of options. I've tried all kinds of different meds and could sleep through all of them and felt no difference physically, and my relationships with friends and family and the quality of my schoolwork are *really* starting to take a hit.

SO! My questions:

* Are certain brands of patches better than others? What about off-brands? (Basically, which patch did you try that you liked best and are there any that should I avoid at all costs)
* Does dosage vary by weight/age (whether formally acknowledged in the instructions or not)? I'm a 17 year old girl that weighs ~106 pounds (~48 kg) and is 5'3" (160 cm), if that helps.
* Could I keep a 24-hour patch on for those 24 hours, replace it with another patch after that 24 hours, and do that perpetually without overdosing or getting sick?
* How much would it take to overdose? Can continual use have negative effects on overall health? If so, how concerned should I be?
* Do you have to be 18 to purchase them?
* Any (major?) side effects to worry about?
* Is nicotine *really* as addictive as people make it out to be? I've heard that in some people, it's only as addictive as caffeine.
* If I do end up having a patch on every day for all 24 hours of the day, would the addictive qualities even affect me or matter?

I'll try to add things if I think of them... I'm sure that I've forgotten something or some things, I always do. But I'm going to bed right now, so I'll be on to check any responses tomorrow.

Thanks so much if you take the time to help me. Answer as many or as few as you want/can. I appreciate it more than words can say.

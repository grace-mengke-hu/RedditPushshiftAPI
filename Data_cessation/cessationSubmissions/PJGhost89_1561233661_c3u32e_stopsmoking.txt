Day 1! Keeping busy

Smoker for 13 years (from 16), husband and I both smoke but decided it was time. He can pick it up and drop it easily. Longest I've gone cold turkey was 5 days, and I was filled with incandescent rage. 

Got patches this time. Popped my first one on this morning, and I've felt great! I've done loads - cleaned my car from top to bottom (so much stray rolling tobacco!), did washing, did a 2 hour martial arts session, cleaned my kitchen and I'm now gaming with friends. They're having the odd smoke but it's not bothering me so far! 

I bought lollipops just in case, I've only had one today. 

I'm 22 hours in, my house has never been so clean! 

Hints and tips for anything I might not expect? Last time I managed 5 days I didn't experience too many negative side affects except headaches and a tough time sleeping. Suggestions for this would be great! 

Here we go!

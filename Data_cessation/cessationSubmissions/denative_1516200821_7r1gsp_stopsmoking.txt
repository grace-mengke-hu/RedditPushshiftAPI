Day 17

I went to my work holiday party last night and slipped up. I shared a cig with my boyfriend who quit with me. Woke up this morning and there was a cigarette on my coffee table. Boyfriend is still sleeping, so I smoked it. 

It was so nice, but also made me gag. 

Nobody to tell, so I am posting here. 

I feel like a failure.

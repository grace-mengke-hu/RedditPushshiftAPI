Half a Year?!? Thanks, /r/stopsmoking!

Just a quick check-in and thanks to this sub for making this all seem normal and achievable.  

Before this sub I thought I was years away from quitting, then I just stopped.  

Thanks to all the posters and commenters for giving us lurkers a place to lurk.  You have changed my life for the better.  Thank you.

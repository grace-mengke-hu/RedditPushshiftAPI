Sober cravings: 0-3. Drunk cravings: 8-10

It seems like alcohol and cigarettes are inextricably linked in my mind. I can go as long as I want without smoking. But I canâ€™t go as long as I want without a drink. I need one after a couple of days. And as soon as I start drinking, I absolutely need a cigarette.

Does this mean I have to stop drinking ? If not, how can I disconnect alcohol and smoking cravings, so that I can have the inevitable drink without falling back into smoking?

Thanks

Messed up

I was 16 days smoke free and got stressed out and smoked. Shouldn't use stress as an excuse, but I messed up. So today is back to day 1! Just looking for some encouragement, I feel like it's so easy to make excuses as to why to smoke again. I'm going to just try harder this time, I'm tired of the same cycle over and over again. I'm excited and feeling good today!

No more as of today.

Ive been cutting out the toxic and bad habits in my day to day life.

Now smoking is the main focus.

I've been a smoker for 5-6 years and have tried several times to quit but i always seem to fail around the 5 days mark.

But i feel like this time will be different. 

I'm going to start by throwing out all of my smoking stuff like my ashtray, lighters, rolling papers, and the likes.

Don't really know why i am making this post but i feel like if i write it down it becomes more tangible.

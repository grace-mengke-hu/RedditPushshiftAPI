Don't want to stop but know I should. Help

I really don't want to quit smoking. I know that I should and there's a lot of pressure from my friends/family to stop, but I just have this giant list of reasons why I don't want to quit. I've heard that if you plan on quitting you really need to want to, but I really don't. I managed to stop for about a month and a half but then it just got to me and I caved. How can you stop doing something when you have no personal motivation to stop?

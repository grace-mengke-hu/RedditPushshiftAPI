It's been two weeks since my last cig, just need to vent.

So where to start. I'm a 23 yr old male and have been smoking since I was 16. I picked it up from a friend, and it just connected. A few months prior to smoking, my younger sister of 14 years passed away, so I think that was a big contribution to why I kept smoking. 

I don't think I ever really enjoyed smoking, just enjoyed what smoking did for my mental state. I couldn't hold a cig in my mouth, if I did I would hold my breath and keep my eyes shut. I didn't smoke indoors, even if I could, except for Waffle House when my school day was done back in high school. Smoking just became an escape tool, a tool that I used maybe once every 90min just to escape from life for a moment. I had the usual triggers though; after I ate, while driving, before I went to sleep, etc. 
Smoking also helped me be more social. I know it sounds weird but I was one of those outgoing shy kids, who was really loud and liked to talk a lot, but struggled with starting conversations with people I didn't know. I had this trick where even though I always had a lighter I would go up to people who are already smoking and ask for a light. I always thought it would 'spark' up a conversation. (I got the nickname '-realname- light' from college because I ended up being the only one with a lighter, dorm mates would ask for a light and it just stuck as a nickname.)

But you know what? I'm **Happy** I **Stopped**.

It didn't stop on my own, and if fate didn't have it, I would still be smoking right now. On good friday, I got into a head on car collision and severely broke my left arm. I recently moved back into the parents house and I'm grateful I did because they have truly been supportive of this difficult time I'm going through. That being said, I have no mode of transportation (car was totaled) and I can't work because of how bad I broke my arm. [NSFW: Picture of arm](http://imgur.com/JktcWnL)
So I'm stuck at this house with no way of getting cigarettes, as well as doctors orders saying "nicotine will make the healing process take a lot longer" 
I did have 1 cheat cig when my mother drove me to my job to pick up my paycheck, and a co-worker was kind enough to donate one, but that was back on the 14th. 

How am I feeling? Well before I was doing fine, with all the pain meds I was taking. But now I haven't been on my pain meds for 9 days, and mentally I still have moments where I want to smoke. I breathe a lot better, and I eat more regularly. I may still have weak moments like right now where I'll want one, but I know if I'm able to go without for this long, I can go without the rest of my life. I actually started to take walks down the street, which has been very therapeutic. My dad even helped out and bought me some hard candies and lollipops to suck on whenever I'm craving (I'm going to be honest, snacking helps a lot more than sucking. Munching on salted peanuts and popcorn have been the better choices to help curve my cravings.) 
Stopping smoking also motivated me to cut out soda from my diet also. I just overall feel better, and even though the car crash sucked, I think it was just a wake up call to start improving my life. The first step was to no longer smoke, and I know I can keep my nonsmoking habit.

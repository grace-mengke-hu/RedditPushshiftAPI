5 weeks and it feels like it's getting harder, not easier

I'm going through a lot of stress: my car died, I'm unemployed, my boyfriend and I had to move in with my parents for a short stint, my cat is in limbo at someone elses house as they wont let her stay here, my mother is unbearably noisy and doesn't respect my space.

Both my boyfriend and mom smoke. So it's always around me. I know I don't want to smoke but man, I'm so fucking stressed, anxious, and annoyed. I know it won't help, but it's tempting as hell. 

I'm taking care of myself and trying to reduce stress through meditation, exercise, sleeping well and journaling. I'm also working on all my problems: finding employment, housing and a vehicle to get away from this uncomfortable situation.

So on the weekend I want to let loose and have a couple drinks with friends, but my friends smoke too and alcohol exaberates the temptation a whole lot. So alcohol for stress relief is out.

I've been tracking my cravings on the smoke free app and have definitely noticed they went down until things sort of fell apart then they spiked up again to the levels of day 2 and 3.

Without cigarettes to cut the edge off I am becoming a total asshole. The meditation and exercise is helping, but I'm still on edge all the time.

Sorry for the rant. I know I don't want smokes and that it won't help at all. I know both my boyfriend and mom are trying to quit and I'm an example to them. But man, wheres the quick  release stress button when you need it? Lol thanks for listening.

Stay strong everybody.

Just smoked my last smoke

I lost track of how many times I’ve tried. But I really want to be free of this. I just celebrated 1 year of sobriety and want to add cigarettes to the list of vices I no longer have. I’ll be using the patch. Posting here for accountability and will be checking back! Wish me luck!

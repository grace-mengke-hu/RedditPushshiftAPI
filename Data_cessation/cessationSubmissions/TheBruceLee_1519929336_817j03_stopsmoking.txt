1 month of not smoking and NoFap 0 day

I have had a craving today to smoke just because I didn't get my work done and because I don't have focus on anything lately, but I just can't stand the smell and taste of it.

I stopped many times for shorter periods of time just to convince myself that I'm 'cleansing out my lungs'...

For past years **I hated** the first cigar in the day, no matter when I take it, it tasted and smell awfully.

So I enjoy not smoking and I feel way better about it.

My biggest problem in life at the moment is lonelyness, I don't have any girl friends in my life, I jerk off, I watch porn... I don't approach women.

I wish one day to have 30 days on NoFap challenge.

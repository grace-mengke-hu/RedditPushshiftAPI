Long time reader

Hey all!

I have been hanging around this sub for a long time. Reading success stories, slip ups and all. I am happy to say I am finally ready to toss these damn things for good- I just came in from my cigarette break and it's -34Â°C!!!

I am 41 and I have smoked for 26 or 27 years. At least the last 14 or 15 years have been a pack a day. Yeah- I'm a die hard. I don't do anything half-ass. 

I have lost both of my parents now (my Mom at 49 and my Dad at 53) and I just could not handle knowing I put my kids through that before it was my time. Also I have a grandchild on the way! I want to enjoy that grand baby and spoil him/her rotten!

So, enough of my history. I am wondering what you guys can lend me for support? Favourite apps? Coping methods? Do I try a crutch? Pretty anxious about this.

Four days down!

I never thought I would even be able to handling giving up the tobacco for even a single day let alone four! No cravings that are so bad as to cause me to take another drag. Nope. 

I want to be a non smoker! God damnnit I am gonna do it.

Good job to all successful quitters. Current smokers, never think it is too hard. Its not. You are stronger than you think.

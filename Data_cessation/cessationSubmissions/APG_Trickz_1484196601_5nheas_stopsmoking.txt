One week!

So, I'm really surprised.

During past attempts - the first week has been the worst. Stress, anger, frustration; the lot. 
I've usually had many arguments with my partner and lost my cool at most things I've done.

During this first week of quitting, I had my 21st birthday - surely bound to slip up.
However I decided that I would crash my motorbike on my 21st, because y'know.. That's fun.
So down I went all because a lady didn't give way and I hit a patch of leaves trying to dodge her car.
Ended up in hospital for a majority of my birthday and only got time for a beer or two in the evening.
So, there was a huge threat to my quitting attempt avoided (albeit  not in the way I would've liked - now forced to sit at home with a torn up leg that keeps splitting open every time I move).

That was 3 days ago.
I didn't think I'd have a chance in hell of staying off the cigarettes when I literally couldn't leave home and had to sit on my arse all day. What else was there to do?

But y'know what? I have.
I've gone cold turkey with no patches and today marks a week and I feel GREAT.
No stress, no tense arguments with my partner (infact happier than ever).

I thoroughly believe that if you aren't a heavy smoker (15+ a day) that patches might not help. I have used patches on every other quit attempt and had 0 luck - but now that I've gone without, I kicked that nicotine faster than ever and now the cravings are easier to get over.

Thanks to this subreddit for always providing great help and letting us all know that there's hope.

One week down, a long time to go!

Best of luck to everyone, remember - NOT EVEN ONE.

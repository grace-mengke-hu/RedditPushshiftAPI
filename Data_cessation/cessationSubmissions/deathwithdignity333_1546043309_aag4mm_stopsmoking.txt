Will this work?

I've started to attempt to quit smoking, I'm just adding an extra 5-10 minutes between cigs everytime I get comfortable. Right now I smoke one every 50 minutes, and by January I want to be smoking one an hour. Should I be doing this more quickly? A lot of people here seem to have quit cold turkey but I'm not sure that would stick for me. Any advice would be appreciated

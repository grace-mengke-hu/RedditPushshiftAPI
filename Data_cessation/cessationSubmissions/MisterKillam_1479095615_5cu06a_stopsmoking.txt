Just smoked my last cigarette.

I told myself and several friends that I'd finish out the pack I was on and stop there.  I stubbed out my last cigarette about ten minutes ago, so I guess I'll see how this goes.  I've got loads of people holding me to it.  I look forward to not wanting cigarettes anymore.  Got any advice for a first-time quitter?

2 weeks and I'm a non smoker

I've drank and not smoked, was angry and not smoked,got stressed and not smoked etc. I just have no desire smoking whatsoever the past few days. I don't even think about smoking except when I think oh man its amazing that I'm not smoking. I'm free ! 

I can't even imagine myself smoking again or being in a situation where I would want to smoke. It feels great

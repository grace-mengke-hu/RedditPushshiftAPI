80 day report

I feel cured. This last week I have had no urges at all. I have been stressed, had a lot of work, without even thinking about tobacco. It feels great. I can also game, see a movie, relax after exercise with no urges at all. Even alcohol isn't a challenge anymore.

I'm just here to say that there is hope for everyone. I was also one of those thinking I might never get rid of the urges or never be as relaxed without tobacco, but here we are. It took a little bit more than 70 days for me to be cured, but I'm not saying it's the same for everyone. The worst cravings for me was over by day 20 and from there the battle wasn't too hard towards day 70.

Keep fighting! You might think that you'll never get rid of the urges or always feel stressed without them, but you will eventually be cured. And it feels amazing

Willpower, Easyway, Substitutes or Tapering. Which way worked for you?

I need help.

I've tried all these methods over the years. Longest I've quit for is 5 weeks. I've been on e-cigs exclusively for the past 10 months, so many of the downsides are now gone (smell, cost, stigma etc.) But I'm very aware that I'm still addicted to nicotine, and still deliberately inhaling harmful toxins into my lungs and bloodstream for no good reason.

Last Sunday I decided that was it, no more. By the following day I was so agitated and depressed (near suicidal) I decided it wasn't worth it, and it wasn't the right time. Right now I'm using a weaker e-juice, and I found some 0mg which I'm using to dilute the regular stuff. I'm trying the tapering method, in the hope to reduce my dependency on this drug, so that when I'm ready to try again, the withdrawal won't be so severe.

Will this work?

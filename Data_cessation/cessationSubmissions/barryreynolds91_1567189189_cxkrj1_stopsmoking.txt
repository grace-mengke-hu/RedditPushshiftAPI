3 months smoke free today!

Smoked a pack a day for 10 years and finally had enough. Thought quitting would be hard but it’s the most rewarding thing in the world

1) I’ve saved SO MUCH MONEY
2) I’m less stressed at work 
3) My skin and teeth look amazing 
4) I’m cycling to work now - and it’s starting to show on my legs ;) 
5) Long haul flights are a breeze now
6) food tastes amazing - why did no one tell me this before ??
7) I’m so much more sociable now - no need to rush outside for a fag every 30 min at dinner 

The list goes on. Just push through - it’ll be the most rewarding thing you’ve ever done 🙏

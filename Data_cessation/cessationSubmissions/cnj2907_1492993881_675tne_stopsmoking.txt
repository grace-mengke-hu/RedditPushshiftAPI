So last week something happened...

I had been travelling and visiting somr new friends I made online. 

They had made a joint for me (weed+Tobacco). They offered me and I tried, I coughed everything our and felt sick.

My body literally rejects be nicotine and smoking in general.8 months down the line.

I am surrounded by smokers but I never feel like smoking anymore! I think it is a great feat!

GL Us to continue the streak... More than 8 months and still counting.

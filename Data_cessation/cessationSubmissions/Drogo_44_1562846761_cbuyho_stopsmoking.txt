Day 1

I'm about 14hours in... this is my 4th time quitting in my life. 32m been at it since i was 19. Some clean streaks here and there....but I've given away too much of my body and my money to this filth. 

I'm tired of the cycle of "craving-smoke-satiation-craving-smoke" ... It is incessant it goes on forever. A slave to chemicals. I was a first thing in the morning smoker. 20 a day. 

Its so sinister. These companies charging us so much money for dried plant leaves rolled up neatly in white paper. With extra stuff added to make it even more addictive ... something that provides no nutritional value. No hydration or anything. 

I just repeat that thing Allen said for now to myself...

 "a smoker in the build up to lighting up and smoking is chasing a level of satisfaction/satiation that a non-smoker enjoys *permanently* "

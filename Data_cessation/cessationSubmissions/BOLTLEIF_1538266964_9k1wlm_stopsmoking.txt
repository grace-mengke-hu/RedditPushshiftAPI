2 months in &amp; overcame many challenges... but I let this last one get to me.

Firstly, not looking for sympathy, just some good honest feedback.

A little over two months ago I set my quit date and after a couple of false starts I reset and I was sticking to my word.
Regardless of the obstacle I was going to do this: things happened with work, with finances, and with health, but regardless I was set - I was an x-smoker.

But then this:
I was at training yesterday and broke (behind repair) a friend's piece of equipment that they'd very graciously lent to me, a piece that I'd spent the last few weeks getting back up to a good working standard. Last time this happened it took 9 months to replace it (if you break it you bought it is one of my ethos) &amp; the somber started to set in.

I stuck around training long after the session was over with some smokers as I'd all but convinced myself I was going to smoke that evening.

After two hours I said to myself "you're either going to smoke or not, thinking about it is only making it worse" and at that point I just caved. It was like I allowed myself to smoke when I believe I was at the point of going 'fuck it' &amp; heading home.

I'd like to know what happened, why after two months I just let myself smoke, and any plans or ideas to help prevent this type of thing from happening in the future.

Thanks in advance.

TLDR:
Fucked up, don't quite understand the psychology behind why, and any insight would be appreciated.

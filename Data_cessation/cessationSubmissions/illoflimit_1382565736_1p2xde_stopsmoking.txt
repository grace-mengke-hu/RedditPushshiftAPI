I am young, and i need to quit now. I need some advice.

I am only 17, i must quit now.

I started smoking when i was 15. No one pressured me into it. Both my parents smoke. They don't know i smoke. My dad really wants to quit. But my mom doesn't. 

I have made smoking such a routine in my life. I smoke one in the morning, a couple during lunch and a couple after school. Smoking is such a good anxiety and stress reliever for me. During school, i am constantly around smokers, they want to quit too, but it is hard for us. 
We have become enslaved by it and rely on it so much. I started noticing the side effects a couple months ago. I can't breathe as deeply, and my phlem is pretty dark. I feel that cigarettes is hurting my spirit, my motivation. I don't want to die because of this fucking habit, and it pisses me off so much that i don't have the motivation to quit.

I recently saw a picture of a little Iraqi girl who was balled up crying in a chalk drawing of her mother, who was killed. I thought to myself, people are going through so much harder shit than i am, and i can't manage to stop fucking smoking. People would kill to live like me, yet here i am killing myself wasting away.

I need to quit reddit, i need to quit now....

I am vulnerable.

I'll admit it, I am at a vulnerable moment right now.

I really want to quit. I haven't smoked in over 2 months or however many days it has been. The counter says 55 days. 55 days might not seem much to you, but it is an eternity to me.

I have not touched a cigarette. But I have touched a cigarette butt. I found one while clearing out my bag the other day. I threw it away. I wanted to smoke it. It itched in my heart and in my loins, and I knew that I must smoke. But I did not. God it made me cry. Even now I am crying. I am vulnerable and I am useless, but I HAVE GONE 55 DAYS WITHOUT SMOKING. 

I want the nicotine. I want the heat and the drag and the slow pleasure. But I cannot have it. I am in pain, I burn, I am suffering. I am crucified and I cry out as the Son of Man has cried out. I do not mean to be sacrilegious but I feel pain and I hope that something can hold me and tell me that it is okay. But my cigarettes have been taken away, they have been given away, which is worse, and I will be alone for ever. 

I am vulnerable, you are vulnerable, but we must not give up. The itch plagues my bones, my heart, I cannot sit still for the itching inside me, but I am in pain and I am in love with my cigarettes. Yet I must part from them. Help me, for I feel like I am about to die.

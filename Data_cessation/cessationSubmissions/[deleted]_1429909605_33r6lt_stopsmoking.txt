Quitting cigs after quitting weed

Hey guys. I'm on mobile so I'll try not to make this a wall.
      I'm not really sure what I'm looking to get out of this. I guess I just want some feedback on my thoughts. I'm 20 years old. 
       I started smoking when I was 15. Shortly after, I started smoking weed. I'm 40 days today off of weed and can't help but think cigarettes should be next on the chopping block. I'm just terrified. I'm already wound so god damn tight. I loose my temper at the drop of a hat and cigs are my only escape now. I quit for about 50 days last year, had a fight with my step dad and hopped right off the wagon. 
      Can anyone relate to being already high strung and trying to quit? I get nasty when I'm pissed and don't want some dumb shit to slip out of my mouth because I'm jonesing. I would love to just suck it up and go for it, but I guess I just wanted to see what people do for their anger when quitting? Who am I kidding? I'm stalling. Fuck. Someone help.

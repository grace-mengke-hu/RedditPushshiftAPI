Went to a "Friendsgiving" event this weekend that had a lot of smokers, but stayed inside during smoke breaks. Still some temptation, but realizing my goals is more important than temporary satisfaction. Plus I'd have to start withdrawals again. Hard pass. Presenting #019 Rattata. See you tomorrow.

Make me want to stop

I smoked a lot about a year ago, stopped for about a month, got back on for a few months, was off again for about a month, and it has basically been a constant cycle. At the moment i smoke a cigarette or two every few days. Im not proud that i do it but at the same time i dont feel the incentive to quit all together. I know that im not going to really stop unless i truly want to, so i come here to try to be convinced. Tell me why to quit for good!

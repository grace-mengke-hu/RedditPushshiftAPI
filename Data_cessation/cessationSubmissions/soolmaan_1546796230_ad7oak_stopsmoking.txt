advice concerning (dealing with) partner who has lost faith in me quitting smoking

Hi all! 

I have been lurking here on all of my quit-attempts, thank you for all your honest sharing and inspiration. Currently on day 6 smoke-free! 

&amp;#x200B;

I do however have a question on how to cope with a situation. Due to many failed attempts and broken promises  concerning my smoking-addiction I am now dealing with my partner (social smoker)  who has lost faith and is finding it hard to be supportive in this current attempt. I want to take full responsibility, but I do miss his support this time around and feel quite lonely at times not being able to share my struggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if any of you have any advice on how to deal with the situation as is.   


Thanks so much in advance :) &lt;3

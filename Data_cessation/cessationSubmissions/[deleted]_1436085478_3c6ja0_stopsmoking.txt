One month!

Ohh, I can't find words to express my feeling now. Its been a roller coaster ride but I stuck to it. And, the result is 30 days without a smoke. THIS IS JUST INSANE!!!!

I'm still suffering from some odd coughs and a sore throat here and there. But, overall I feel great and energetic. The best part is that I can complete /r/c25k without losing hope and BREATH!

When you almost cave, remember that nicotine does nothing for you.

Today was one of the most stressful days I've had in a long time due to a lot of personal stress and mistakes. All in all I haven't missed smoking or snus, but today I wanted nothing more than light up or grab a portion and let the nicotine take my stress away.

But I kept reminding myself it only makes it worse. Nicotine doesn't do a damn thing for you. I left my apartment, walked to the gas station, and got myself something to eat instead. I didn't look twice at the junk behind the counter, because I knew it wouldn't help, but nourishing my body would.

Join me and choose not to smoke today.

I absolutely HAVE to do this! But where to start?

I am at a point where my doctor tell me I have pretty good odds of clutching at my chest in near future from stroke or heart attack after smoking for 49 years! (God I feel so ashamed and stupid saying that out loud!) Also financially I have royally placed myself behind the 8 ball and as a pensioner the cost is no longer tenable! How can I do it... I was thinking.. ok I'll go through my little Christmas stuff and then JUST DO IT! I don't have a problem really stopping... my problem is STAYING stopped! I should also point out that I am going to quit drink too, as it is my downfall EVERY time. I've already given up weed... (lol just when they finally made it legal after 60 years!) Any thoughts, advice.. I'm all ears! Thank so much to anyone who could help!!

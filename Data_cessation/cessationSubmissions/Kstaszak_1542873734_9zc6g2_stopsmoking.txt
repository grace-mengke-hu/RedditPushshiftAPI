Hi everyone

So I am just trying to get through a rough time right now, my cravings seem to be lessening since yesterday,  it's been a little over 3 days at this point,  I am taking chantix for 27 days so far, and it's working ok,  I still get cravings, but cigarettes do nothing for me,  I dont feel better when I smoke,  i actually feel worse,  i have tried vaping too the past 2 days and it's with 0mg of nicotine.... pointless,  it's like a pacifier but I'm growing to old for that, the novelty has worn off...  now what should I do to pacify myself?  I'm really worried about tomorrow.... I'll be going to my friends house for Thanksgiving,  only 1 smoker I need to worry about but she smokes my brand and wont tell me no if I ask for 1.... please give me strength not to ask.....

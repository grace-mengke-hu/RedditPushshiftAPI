Worst Nic Fit Ever

I quit on Friday night. Chose midnight so I wouldn't have any left over when I woke up the next morning. I've been 5 days without a single ciggy. Now I'm having the worst nic fit I've had since I quit. 5 days in?! What gives? NOTHING has worked. I've taken deep breaths, taken a walk, snacked on nuts, chewed gum, ate candy, snacked on carrots. Nothing will make this nic fit go away. What do I do? This is going on 2 hours now. I'm holding off but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out.

***EDIT***
I'm experiencing thought fixation, not a nic fit. Thanks Whyquit.com

Trying to quit smoking in steps

Hey guys/girls I'm new to this subreddit, and posting on reddit altogether. I'm trying to quit smoking before I get too far over the edge. Right now I'm progressing to the point to where I'm at about a pack every couple days. I'm not at the worst place I could be at thankfully, but I'd prefer to not get there. I was hoping to find good tips here on how to stop all together in steps. Right now I'm looking to find the least concentrated brand so I can work my way down, or maybe even an allternative method to get to my goal of no smoking. Any tips anyone could provide would be great! Thanks in advance for anyone who can provide a little bit of help.

Day one for the second time

Wish me luck I’m trying to go day one without a cig. I Wasn’t able to throw out my pack this morning but planning on not touching it. Just there Incase I freak out. 
Trying to get my energy, oxygen and smell and taste back to normal. 
I plan on replacing with smoking mint or herb if I have to absolutely find the urge to smoke something.

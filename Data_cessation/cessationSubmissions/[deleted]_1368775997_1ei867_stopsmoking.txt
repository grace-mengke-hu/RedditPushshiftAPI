Over the three day hump. But I have questions...

So far so good. I am about three days and five and a half hours in. But, in this short amount of time I have noticed that I am eating a lot more then usual, particularly at supper. I am a big guy as it is and I know weight gain is usually expected when quitting. So, what is the best way to curb the appetite that is trying to compensate for the lack of cigarettes? I am using the patch, chewing a lot of gum, and keeping my hands and mind busy with other things. I plan on getting a gym membership tomorrow. But, in regards to a steady, less compensating diet what has worked for you? Thanks in advance.
tl;dr ...I really don't want to get even fatter.

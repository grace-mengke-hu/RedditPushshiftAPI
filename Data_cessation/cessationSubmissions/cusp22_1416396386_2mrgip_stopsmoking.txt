8 days in. Feel the blood pumping in my head, can't sleep properly.

Hello r/stopsmoking

I switched to a better lifestyle about 2 months ago, waking up early, running, eating right etc. I even lost  some weight, which was cool! 

Now, 8 days ago I decided to quit smoking as well after listening to the Allen Carr - Easy Way To Stop Smoking audio book on somebody's suggestion and it was great and easy. 

BUT today, I called in sick at the office. Have been feeling blood pumping in my head... I tried to sleep all day.. But couldn't.  Really need to rest my head.. Please suggest something. 

I sleep properly,  eat right, exercise... Did I miss anything?

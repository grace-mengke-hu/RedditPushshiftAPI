one year tomorrow!

It is so incredible to realize that I have gone an entire year without smoking!  I never could have made it without all the amazing people here. When I decided to try and stop smoking, I really did not think I would do it. But when I was having a bad day, I would come here and read the posts of people one day, one week, six months ahead of me and feel "I can do this". I will always have that little bastard addiction beast whispering in my ear at weak moments, but now it has no real power over me. Thank you all for giving me the chance to have a healthier life. And to everyone going through the the beginning of the journey, stay strong, hang on by your fingernails if you have to because you can do it and it does get easier and it is so worth it!

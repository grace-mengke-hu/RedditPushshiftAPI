Just found this sub and gonna make a start!

I'm almost 18 and have been smoking since I was 15. First Marlboro's, then rolling tobacco. My dad sometimes jokingly asks: "How much do you smoke a week?" My response: "About 3 packets of tobacco in 2 weeks." 

But is more like 5 in 3. 

How much time does it take to get rid of the urge? Does it even go away at all? Are the first 3 days the hardest?

Just keep breathing, just keep breathing, what do you do? You breeeeeeeeatheeeeee!

Just got home from my Kenny Loggins concert.  It’s been 1 day, 23 hours and 38 minutes since my last cigarette.  I was nicely surprised that smelling the second hand smoke from others at the concert didn’t aggravate me as much as it should have, then again I’m used to not smoking around my family so ignoring it with them around was usual.  What got me was how hard it is to not bust out a pack of smokes after they drop me off at home, sit on my step and smoke away to play “catch up.”

I’m not going to do it, of course.  My butt is glued to my bed for the rest of the night even if it kills me.  I’m just so used to coming home from events and indulging in the stuff I used to hide from family.  

It feels really good, but at the same time like I’m splitting in two.  That’s why I’m breathing.  Deeply and fully, in-between sips of my canned margarita and water...may make some coffee to finish off the trifecta there...just breathing and drinking. 

...the craving is almost gone now, thanks for letting me write through it.  I think I’ll just hop into the shower to nab the last of it away here.  Good luck to everyone else!

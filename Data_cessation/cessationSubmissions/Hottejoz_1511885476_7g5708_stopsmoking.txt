quitting for the 4th time..

hey fellas, i also quit today..after non-countable endeavours and three longer periods of not smoking..between 2 and 5 months..this time i will stay strong. I always wanted to indulge in a certain ritual for stoping to smoke to build up some kind of a barrier that will prevent me from getting weak. I tried everything: I smoked my last cigarette before a church and then whent inside praying, i went to the graves of old friends and family members and made a vow, i tried acupuncture, i read (and listened to) Allen Carr several times, i participated in a shaman ritual, i tried welubutrin and so on! Today at 4pm, my father came back from an amputation operation because of late effects of strong smoking (though he quitted 10 years ago)...This is my day, my barrier...i don't want to end like this nd go through all the suffering as my father did. It's not difficult to stop. You just have not to smoke, and Do everything else and much more!

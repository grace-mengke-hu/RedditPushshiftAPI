The bet that got me to finally quit for good!

My friend and I have been on and off quitting for the last 2 years, off for as much 6 months.  Well last night we decided on a bet that should do the trick.  The winner will get a portrait done of himself in any pose they choose, with whatever background they choose.  Anything.  This portrait will be paid for by the loser and hung in the loser's house at a location of the winner's choosing.  The loser may never explain that this is a bet.

I dont care how bad i want a cig, there's no way in hell that im staring at his ass every night.

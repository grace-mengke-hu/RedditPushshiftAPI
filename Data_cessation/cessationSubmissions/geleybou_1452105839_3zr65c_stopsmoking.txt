Still Truckin'

I quit six months ago, and I'm proud to say it gets easier every day.  I want to thank this subreddit and everyone here for being so supportive and positive.  I still come back here to keep reminding myself of the commitment I made to myself.

You guys rock! Keep it up.  And for those of you still struggling, I know how it goes.  But I promise every day gets easier after a while.

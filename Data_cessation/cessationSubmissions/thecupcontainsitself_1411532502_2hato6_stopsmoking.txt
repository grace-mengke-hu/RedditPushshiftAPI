It's been a year and I feel like I'm not gonna make it

I've been going through a rough time with my girlfriend and I've moved to another country. In this country, you can basically smoke anywhere. The temptation has been great. I feel like it will help me relax and enjoy myself more. I tell myself that I can do it just for a little while and then quit again later, maybe in just under a year. I only smoked two years, and am in my twenties. I tell myself: "what's the difference between smoking two years or three years? I'll have plenty of time in life for my lungs to recover. It's not going to put me at that greater risk if I just do it another year."

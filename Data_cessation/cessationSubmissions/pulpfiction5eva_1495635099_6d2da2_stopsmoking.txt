I Messed Up Y'all

So I had gone a little over three weeks without smoking, after being a regular smoker for three or four years, but last night after meeting with some friends I completely caved and bought a pack of cigarettes, smoking four of them. It felt so good but now I'm absolutely furious with myself. Not sure I'm looking for advice as I know what I need to do, just need to get this off my chest. Sorry all. :(

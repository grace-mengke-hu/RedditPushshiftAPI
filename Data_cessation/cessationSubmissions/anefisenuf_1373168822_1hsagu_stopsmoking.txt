One smoke free week behind me and I feel fantastic.

This is my first attempt at ever quitting after 18 years of smoking, and I can't believe how amazing I feel. It's been 8 days and I have no cravings, I have barely even had fleeting thoughts about smoking for 2 or 3 days already.

I never in a million years thought that I could quit, let alone feel so good about quitting, but I did it - and I wish I'd known a long time ago that I was capable. I can't believe a week has already past! If you're on your first few days.. hang in there, it will be over sooner than you realize!

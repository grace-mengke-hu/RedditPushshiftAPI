A Full Month Quit, Two Steps Forward, And One Step Back

I'm on the eve of a full month. And I almost caved tonight. My hardest cigarette to not smoke is the "celebration" or "reward" cigarette. Today, I felt shitty emotionally all day. 

Then, I almost lost it over chicken. I spent the evening doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and my laundry. I was feeling pretty good getting things accomplished until I moved onto dinner. My plan was to make a Chicken Alfredo pasta dish. I got out a pot, put the chicken into it, and filled it full of water to boil. As I turned around from the sink to the stove the handle on the pot broke. The entire pan of water fell onto the floor and along with the raw chicken. 

I got the pleasure of cleaning water off my floor and restarting dinner. My dog got some free chicken because instead of throwing it away (I'm too much of a germaphobe to eat floor chicken) I boiled it for her to have a treat throughout this week.

I spent the rest of the night moping around wanting a cigarette. I was on my 5th day without NRT after 3 and a half weeks on NRT and nearly a full month without smoking. Instead of buying smokes I went to the store and bought another bottle of 2mg lozenges. I think I quit the NRT too soon. While I made it to the 5th day I spent the past few days feeling too miserable. So, I decided it was better to do another week or two on NRT than to go buy a pack of cigarettes. However, it was a very close call.

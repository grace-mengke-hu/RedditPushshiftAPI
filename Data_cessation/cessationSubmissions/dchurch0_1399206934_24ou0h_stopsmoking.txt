I am officially a non-smoker!

I am visiting family this weekend. My mom, brother, and sister-in-law all smoke like chimneys. They all live together, and they smoke inside.

I am visiting for the weekend, and the smell of smoke is driving me crazy (not in a craving or good way). It just plain stinks.

But anyway, I haven't been home for a visit in about a year and a half, so last night my brother and I got good and drunk together, and I DID NOT SMOKE!

I can now finally say that I FEEL like a non-smoker. I have hung out in a stinky smoke filled house and drank with family, been offered a smoke, and declined. I finally have complete power over this addiction, and it feels great.

Extremely moody!!!

Okay so this is more a vent than anything else but I am extremely moody at the moment!! I am seriously considering ending my marriage, I have absolutely no motivation to leave my bedroom today and I fear that I will really lose it if I even try to talk with my husband 🙁 

I don’t want a cigarette! I really don’t even though I know my mind is trying to make me think I do. 

Is this moodiness because of quitting or is it just that I am starting to look at all aspects of my life?

God I really think if I could cry it out I would feel better but I feel so cold and angry inside 😩

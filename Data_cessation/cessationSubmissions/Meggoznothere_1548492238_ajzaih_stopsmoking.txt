Struggling here .ive quit but I haven’t

So I have been a smoker for 15 years!! Yes half my life. The only time I have quit Twice before due to pregnancy but it really made me sick to my stomach. So technically I have smoked three cigs within three days but quit 5 days ago from my pack a day (22 cigs) here’s the thing I’m fine at home...I eat a lot lol...fine driving to work....but I work as a CNA and my coworker is hellacious. Just nasty. She acts like she’s your friend but really isn’t and I don’t what it is by just seeing her face makes me want to puff puff away. Luckily I’ve limited it to one on my hour break ( which use to be like 8) I’m determined to just be done. I will say they have tasted morbid. But anywho here goes to 24 hour no smoking. Even at work. Even if I catch a case lol jk ....or am I

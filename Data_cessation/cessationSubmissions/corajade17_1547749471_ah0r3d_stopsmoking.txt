Quitting Hookah

I started smoking hookah in college, and what started as a fun thing to do with my friends became a crippling habit. I've spent 10 years smoking, and struggled with quitting over the last 2 years. 

Now, I'm ready to let it go. I'm also transgender, which gives me extra motivation to stop because nicotine will interfere with the chemicals. 

The hard thing, and I think a lot of other kinds of smokers will relate to this, is the social aspect. Hookah is inherently a social activity, and my friends still enjoy it, so it inevitably comes around. 

I'm strong enough to step away now, I've hit a good point where I'm ready to say goodbye, I'm just going to have to find a way to separate myself from my friends late at night when the hookah comes out. 

I'm looking forward to being part of this community, and if anyone knows any ways to help me with this, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you all!

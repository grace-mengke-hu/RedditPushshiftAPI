How my image of smokers changend

I made it to the two weeks mark and learned a lot about myself during this time. However, there is one thing I notice about others I would like to share and see if you maybe feel the same.

First, I want to say that I am not a judgemental person. I don't see a big moral side in quitting cigarettes. I beleive every adult should be free to do whatever they want, including smoking.

However, while being a smoker I also smoked because I thought it is kind of cool, my image of that has changed 180 degrees over the last two weeks. Yesterday I was stopping at a red light in traffic and the driver in the car besides me lightened up a cigarette. It looked terribly pathetic to me! a few days earlier I sat in a lecture at my university and could see a balcony from there where a young couple sat in the sun. They were chain smoking cigarettes and again the scenery looked so unattractive to me, I couldn't believe people want to live like that.

I smoked for 13 years a pack a day. Anybody who is thinking about quitting, there is a good chance you will find smoking disgusting and pathetic after a very very short time into the process.

Post for holding myself to it, also apprehensive at the same time...

I've been smoking for almost 20 years now, so I just made the first step... as in not buying a pack when I'm going to run out soon.  I have a job interview on Monday and have been worried I would miss out on a great opportunity if for some reason they smelled cigarettes on me and judged me based on that.  I honestly am the most worried about the 3 hour drive to the interview without a cigarette the most at this point.  I've been wanting to quit for a long time.  I've also read that quitting smoking sometimes helps with tinnitus, which would be a great plus as well.  Any tips on how to handle a long drive?  I feel like I'm just gonna be thinking about smoking the whole time.  Also, should I get gum or something before the interview?  I'm clearly not a writer, but oh well.

Also, this is a throwaway because my usual account is associated with my facebook page and feel like the last thing I want is tons of friends always asking how the quitting is going, or if my potential employer is looking through social media(doubtful, but who knows these days?)

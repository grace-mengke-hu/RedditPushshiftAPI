After 23 years, I've decided it's time to quit.

I just can't do it anymore. Stinking like smoke, my chest feeling heavy sometimes, wasting money on something that will kill me.

Tomorrow is my quit date. I have a whole week off of work, so I won't be around my work smoking buddies. I can get a good seven days in before I  will be around that pressure.

I'm scared, but my plan is lots of water, teatree oil toothpicks, removing all prior evidence of smoking, the cessation nation app, the easy way book, and this subreddit. 

I will check in for support as well as to be supportive of others. I will have a badge. I will deal with weird sleeping and moodiness. I need to get my health back. It's been so long, and I need to do this for my health and my wallet.

I want to succeed and beat this foul smelling thing's ass! Tomorrow morning I will login and get my badge. I'm going to be coming to you all for support when the times get rough.

I've been a lurker since the beginning of this year, and the time is now!

6/3/2013 - The first day to a new and improved me!

2nd day since I switched to Vuse. Anyone else replacing cigarettes with electronic ones?

I've decided to quit smoking for basically the hundredth time, and I'm using Vuse e-cigarettes for the time being. They're actually pretty comparable to the comfort of the real thing, just without a bunch of poison added in. 

Has anyone here had success by switching to e-cigarettes?

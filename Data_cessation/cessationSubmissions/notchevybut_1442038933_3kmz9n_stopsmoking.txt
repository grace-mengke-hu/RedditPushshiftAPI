I reset my badge today.

I hadn't smoked since Tuesday night ( you can tell from the past tense how this went). Reset my badge tonight and less than an hour later, and an hour before my shift at my restaurant, I found out my boyfriend has to move back to England in November due to visa issues. I managed to make it through all that and my shift, and then even through glasses of wine after my shift, and my boyfriend was awol through all of it. Almost made it to the bus stop to go home and I stopped at a 7-11 for a pack. 

I have no excuses. I know I'd prefer to be a non smoker with a boyfriend moving away than a smoker in that situation but it was a brief moment of relief from all the anxiety on my chest. Here's to trying again tomorrow.

New beginnings!

So I am 12 days smoke free! I found this site from a quit smoking app I am using. This is the first time (of MANY attempts) that I have not caved and smoked. I usually either bum "just 1" or give up all together. My dad is one of my biggest reasons for quitting. 2 years ago he was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. He has beaten it twice now and still struggles with smoking. I have tried everything to help him from vapes to nicotine toothpicks. He has cut down tremendously, but still fighting this demon. I figured I will just quit and that may give him some motivation and have someone who is with him on his journey to a heathier life.
My girls are also my reason. They understand my father has cancer and why. I never tried to hide that from them. I honestly do not want to put them through the constant worry I go through with my father. My family is very supportive. Having support is key!
I am also a reason for quitting! It has taken a lot of time, a lot of effort (and failures) to get here. I want to be healthier and more active with my family. I am tired of my chest and throat hurting. Im tired of running out of breath doing simple things. IM TIRED!!!
I hope this helps with reaching out to those who know or are going through the same thing. Its hard with my husband and daughters sometime. While they are supportive but they dont really understand, but I will take what I can get! On to a brighter more healthier lifestyle!!! üòÅüö≠

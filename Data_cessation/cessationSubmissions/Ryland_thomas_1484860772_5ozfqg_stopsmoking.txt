Started smoking at 12 stopped on my 27th birthday !

I remember back living in south africa, id wait for my mum to go to work and then quickly steal all the stompies (fag ends) and smoke what little was left of them. That was my first introduction to smoking, ever since then all iv known is a life with smoking.

Although during my younger years, not saying 27 is old im talking my teens early 20s i was pretty fit i noticed the older i was getting the more injuries and pains and fatigue from workouts i was getting, being military it wasnt helping, so on the 18th of december 2016, after a week or so over prepping mentally i took the leap. Not the best time to do it admittedly, but if i didnt do it then it would take me another a year before i tried quitting. I would for the first week allow myself to have a smoke if i was getting irritable etc with the misses or desperately just needed one, i didnt find this to difficult and found myself needing them less and less even in that first week, now that i was genuinely trying to quit, i must also add i used no help as in vapes etc the only thing i added into my life was sucking sweets, i found this helped massively. Eventually after that first week, i just stopped altogether and for some reason its been the easier then any other time. 

Im finding my fitness slowly improving, i am actively trying to improve it. Which also gives my mind some stimulation and takes it off the thoughts of smoking, which i wont lie i still get. Its a daily battle but a battle I'm glad i have taken on !

17 year old wondering...

Hey guys first time posting here. I have been smoking for a year and a half now... And after like 1 year i started having some lower left abdominal pain after i smoked. Did anyone have those? But anyways today i smoked my last cigarette and i'm going to stop smoking before its to late for my health for my life and for my friends and family. 
Thank you for reading and i will await your support and i will support everyone on this group.

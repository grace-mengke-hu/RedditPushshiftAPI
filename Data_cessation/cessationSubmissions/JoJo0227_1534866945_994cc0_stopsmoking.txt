A month in! There's so much lung capacity for activities!

To anyone who's on the fence about quitting, you'll feel so much better when you do. I've started running daily to make sure I don't slip up and it's helped so much.

I don't know if I've actually saved any money since I end up spending money on other bullshit, but my mood and my health are a lot better than 30 days ago.

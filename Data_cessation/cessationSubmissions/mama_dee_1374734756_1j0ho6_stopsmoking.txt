Nervous, elated, sick of feeling sick. Resetting the badge for the last damn time!

Hey everybody! At this point you all feel like old buddies seeing me through this millionth time trying to quit.  But this time, I'm not just trying.  It's gonna fucking happen! 

I'm putting on a patch tonight, and weird dreams be damned I'll wake up bright and refreshed tomorrow committed to:

1. Not wheezing with each breath after a long day of sucking down smoke for no good reason.
2. Not feeling like my mouth is coated in grime ALL THE FUCKING TIME.
3. Having the money to actually add to my savings, instead of dipping into it.
4. Showing this addiction that I will fuck it up if it ever tries to mess with my head again (I read that awesomely asskicking post on this sub from earlier - seriously to the person who wrote that I will be reading it as soon as I wake up tomorrow and I can't thank you enough for your general amazingness).
5. Beating the odds, and finally being a person in my family who can resist substance abuse, however difficult it may be.
6. Not smelling gross, or have the constant feeling of needing to wash my hands and face to get the gunk off. 
7. Knowing that with every day I stay quit, I'll be healthier and happier, and more able to deal with the ups and downs that life inevitably hands me.
8. Being able to run.
9. Being able to smell better. And finally tasting something other than vague food flavors hidden under a generous dusting of chemicals.
10. Not snoring.  Yes, it's embarrassing.  My bf is very kind in his descriptions, but apparently I'm a chainsaw at night. NOT FUCKING SEXY. 

The list could go on forever.  And it will.  I'll continue to come here and share my reasons, particularly when I feel weak, and I know (because the kindness and compassion I've seen here is some of the most impressive I've ever witnessed) that people will hear me.

Cheers you guys! Have a wonderful sleep, and congratulations to everyone who's quit.

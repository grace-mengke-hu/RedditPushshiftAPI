My hiatus, dreams, and reasons

So hey, I am back from a 1 month hiatus from my last comment. Which sucks. I wanted so badly to quit. This will now become my 5th quit journey and I am 2 days into it. I believe I will be more active in this sub as a way of keeping me accountable. I still cannot explain why I started smoking again just to have to quit .... Again. I'm tired of doing this, irritated at, and disappointed in myself. So my question for myself is why do I keep going back? Even after 6 months and 4 months... Why? 

Alright. Now for the lighter note. I had a dream that all the cigarette butts I threw out in my life were in my car, packed to the top. I can't even imagine what that would smell like. I was disgusted. I started shoveling them out but they kept coming and filling my car up. I love analyzing dreams and the best I could come up with is the dream was the exaggeration of the battle to quit smoking. Let me know what you think and if you have had any weird dreams. I can't be alone in this. 

Reasons I want to quit:
1. Smell - of me, my clothes, my car, etc.
2. Time - I hate having to excuse myself to get a fix
3. I want to be able to laugh without coughing.
4. When I wake up in the morning, I feel good and awake but as soon as I light up I am tired and nauseous. 
5. I thoroughly dislike the nicotine high after not smoking for a while. 
6. Husband says we can have a baby if I am smoke free for one full year. 

Okay. I'm done. We can do this. I support every single one of you and wish you success. I wish myself success.

6 days smoke free, 3 years sober today

Today I celebrated my 3 year sobriety anniversary. "They" always say it's tough that time of year and "they" are SO right. Today was one of the most challenging days I've had in a long time. I woke up in a terrible mood, messed up at work multiple times, cried a lot (which I NEVER do). I was just a total wreck! I felt like everything I've fought for was for nothing.

But you know what? I got through the day, fixed my mistakes to the best of my ability, and didn't smoke a cigarette. I realized, if i could beat that nasty addiction 3 years ago, I can stop leaning on this crutch.

Thank you r/stopsmoking for being such an inspiration everyday.

24 hours and 32 minutes!

Totally celebrating this morning. I'm going cold turkey. I've been here before and tried numerous ways and methods. But this time I have a lot more determination!

I wasn't a heavy smoker, about 6-7 rollies a day and one or two joints at night (I've quit cannabis too). And I only started about 8 months ago. I think I was rather foolishly expecting quitting to be easy in light of that - but the reality is that I'm not any less of an addict. 

The cravings have been odd. I absolutely hate myself when I smoke yet feel compelled to do it. So I'm really happy I've made it past the 24 hour mark. According to the app I'm using another day will see nicotine fully out of my system. 

Keep strong everyone, we're worth more than this poison.

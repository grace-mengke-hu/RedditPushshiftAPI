Accidentally kind of got addicted again

My buddy totaled his truck due to drinking & driving, broke his clavicle, lost his job of 12 years as he's had other 'incidents' over the years, and will be loosing his motorcycle because he can't make the payments.  So he's been a bit suicidal.  

So I stayed with him at his place for 4 days in a row, barely leaving, and second-handed about a pack and a half per day.

So here I am a few days after leaving, feeling nicotine withdrawals alot like when I quit.

Oh well.  Shit happens.  I won't pick up though.

Good luck everybody!

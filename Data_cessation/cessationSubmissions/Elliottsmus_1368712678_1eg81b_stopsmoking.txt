Almost 4 days and cravings are badddd

So after smoking a pack and a half a day for 6 years I decided to quit... First few days have honestly been hell. Every time I walk outside my apartment or from a restaurant my stomach does a little flip as it waits expectantly for that sweet rush of nicotine. I'm eating about triple what I usually eat and have no energy and get cold sweats in bed. Nights are the worst! Anyone got any advice on how to stay strong? Really wanna manage It this time!

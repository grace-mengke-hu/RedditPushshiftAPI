Been quitting smoking for 3 months since may1st, now time to quit vaping as well

Hi guys, I have stopped smoking since May 1st, but instead I have been vaping a lot to meet my nicotine needs.

I feel much better but I still think vaping is not very healthy. Also, I caught a cold somehow recently so I thought why not give up
entirely?

Anyway, I am kinda afraid of nicotine withdrawal but I believe the hardest part has passed. Thanks!

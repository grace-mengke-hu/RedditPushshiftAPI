terrible skin after quitting

So my skin (mostly in my face) has been extremely irritated since I quit. It's not pimples or acne, really just red and bumpy, i suspect it's my rosacea acting up. It's been fine the last couple of years as a smoker. anyone have experience with this? did your skin get worse with quitting? and if it did, did it get better again? this is really frustrating me.

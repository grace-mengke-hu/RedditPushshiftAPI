Relapsed after 4m 22d - haven't changed my quit date now I feel like a fake

Smoked 3 cigs since first relapse.  This is to keep me honest.  Next one and I'll restart quit date.  Is that okay? 


I don't want to be a smoker.  But shits just bringing me down and I need an outlet.  Depression is getting really bad and it just seems easier to end it than go through it.  Excuses excuses.  I'm so disappointed in myself over this now too.  It doesn't help, it tastes bad, it is BAD for me.  Don't do it anymore dummy.  

Reasons:
1. Wastes money
2. Stains teeth &amp; sink
3. Damages skin and hair
4. Makes me feel sick
5. Tastes awful

Stop rationalizing, this is something I want, even if I know nothing else - I know I enjoy NOT smoking more than smoking.

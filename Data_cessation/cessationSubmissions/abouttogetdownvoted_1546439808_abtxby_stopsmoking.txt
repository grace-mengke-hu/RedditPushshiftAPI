Does anyone else suffer bad bowels and stomach cramps?

Hi all - day 3 for me (quit for new year).

The cravings have been fine to deal with - I feel a little spaced out, hard to focus, but not fighting the urge to smoke much at all really!

My main problem is my stomach just aches and hurts and I feel so bloated. I’ve got painful diarrhoea, some mucus and blood, and it constantly feels like I need to pass something. I’m staying hydrated very well, but can’t figure out why my bowels are acting up so much. I googled it (bad idea) and found out that smoking can protect against some bowel disease and that giving up can mean that it all gets inflamed again. Anyone got similar experiences??

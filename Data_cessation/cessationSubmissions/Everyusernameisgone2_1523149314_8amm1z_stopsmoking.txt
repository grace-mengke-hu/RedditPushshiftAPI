5 days in, and a night out with NO smoking!

As the title says - I was so sure I was going to crack once I was drunk last night. 

But I didn’t! 

And boy is my hangover so much less severe than when I used to smoke a pack in a night on the booze! Even went to the smoking area with my husband and didn’t have one. The smell was overwhelmingly bad. 

This subreddit is amazing, I lurk here all the time and the support is what gets me through. I feel like I am accountable to all you amazing internet strangers. So thank you!

I'm a complete Idiot and I hate myself

I casually started smoking when i was 16, i'm 18 now and with school, work, and a stressing relationship i've used smoking as my stress reliever. I'm not addicted, but i totally am, and I'm not sure what to do. I feel trapped and I just don't want to stop. I hate that I put myself here in the first place

Tried quitting last year... Lets try again

Okay so last year around February I tried quitting. Went a month and then started up again. I don't have nicotine dependency so its not that hard to quit, but I enjoy smoking and I do it cause I want to.

So I've been smoke free for 18 days, whatever nicotine was in my system is long gone, so far its been a breeze, but I know in a few weeks I'll start to feel that I want to smoke again... Any suggestions on what to do at that point? I have enough self-control to just not smoke, but I don't think torturing myself is really worth it...

So any suggestions would be appreciated :)

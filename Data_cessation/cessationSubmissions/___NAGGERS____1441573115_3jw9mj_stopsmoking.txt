When do cravings usually ease off significantly?

It's only day 3 after smoking for 5 years and it's not as bad as I anticipipated.. None the less I go back to work in two days and I'm still getting bad cravings from time to time... I imagine everyone is slightly different but when do cravings finally take a significant drop??

Story time: Things I noticed at 5-8 days

This is a little bit of recall on my part. I meant to do this as I go, and I hope to keep it up, for people who may be going through this same ordeal as me. (I don't care about grammar, punctuation, or writing well)

First off, I work form home when I'm not traveling. I opted to quit when i knew i had a clear schedule of staying home so i wouldn't be out and about and could quarantine myself.

Before the turn of the first week. I had to go grocery shopping for my wife, she wasn't feeling well and I offered to venture out and face the demon on the streets. up to this point I hadn't left the house, as I loved smoking in my Jeep. (being a hard top the smell didn't stick... fortunately) 

I got in to the store fast, luckily no one was smoking by the door. I got all my items and headed to the check out line. As I approached the cashier it hit me. Full in the face. This clerk JUST SMOKED. I mean, she had to of just rushed in and re-opened her line. It was overwhelming. 

I'm not rude, at least not intentionally. So in friendly conversation I ferret out that she intact is actually due her next break she'd been there for a few hours with no relief.

I didn't realize it lingered on a person for so long, I had never smelled that "this person is a smoker" smell before. It was alarming. But she clearly has to be the type that smokes indoors or something. But I pushed it out of my mind. Rushed home, put away the groceries. Got mad props from the wife for not buying smokes while I was out.

TL;DR work from home, no reason to leave house, first time I do, confront "this person just smoked" found out. Successfully avoided buying pack.

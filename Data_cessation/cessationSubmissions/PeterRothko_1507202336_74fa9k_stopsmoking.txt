The GREAT news!

Hello everybody. First off, if like to thank you all for the great support you are providing to me. Xxx

I'm on day 18 and would like to share the positives of my quit. I'm 47 and have smoked for the the past twenty six years so am blown away by the levels of energy coursing through my body.

Early to rise(nagurally) For a big in the crisp morning air before work. Then off to work with my banana smoothie (need the potassium for slightly high blood pressure ) work with a clear head and not running outside every hour for a two cig top up. 

After work off to the gym to do some weights and a spinning class. Then home feeling proud of myself.

Honestly feel 20 years younger and excited about my new healthy energetic life.

Love to you all xxx

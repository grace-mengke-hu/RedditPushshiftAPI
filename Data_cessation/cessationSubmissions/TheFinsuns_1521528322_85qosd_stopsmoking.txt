20 year old and low motivation

Hello Reddit, I'm a 20 year old guy, ex-tenor, ex-karate black belt, and I've been smoking for ~1-2 years. Recently I've taken a step back and looked at everything I've lost just by smoking, and I want to take it all back: my fitness, my breathing and my voice (which wasn't the best or the one with the widest vocal range, but it was decent nonetheless). I'm here to ask you beautiful people if there are any tricks that'll make my endeavor just a bit easier. Have a great day everyone ‚ù§

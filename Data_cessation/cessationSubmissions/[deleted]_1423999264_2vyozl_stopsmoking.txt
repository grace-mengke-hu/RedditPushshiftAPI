Decided to quit smoking today. Need Guidance.

I've been thinking about it for months and decided finally. Threw my pack away as a dramatic gesture but have no idea how to keep it away. I've joined a gym, hoping that will make things easier. Suggest any steps I need to take as a fellow subredditer.

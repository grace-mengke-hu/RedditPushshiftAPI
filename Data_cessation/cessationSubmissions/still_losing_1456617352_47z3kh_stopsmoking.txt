Using the money wisely

According to my stop smoking app, I will save £65 a month now that I've stopped smoking. This is based on the average I entered of 5 cigarettes per day so I actually think it'll be more - sure, I smoked 5 cigarettes on weekdays, but on weekends it could be more like 20 a day, especially if I was drinking. 

I used to go to a gym but stopped going when my contract ended because I found an outdoor boot camp that was cheaper. However, I miss the pool and the classes so I've been wanting to start going again. 

There's a great gym in my town but I always felt that it was too expensive at £40 a month. Tonight I decided to join. I want to tone up and I feel that it is an excellent way to use some of the money I would have spent on cigarettes. I'm sure I'll also be fitter now that I've quit. 

It's been 26 days and I am so proud!

It's actually getting easier :)

During the first week I felt like I was living in that clip from Trainspotting with the crawling baby on the ceiling.
But it's better - it actually is.
I hated the enthusiasm of people who quit (to me it just sucked and then sucked a little bit less over time) but I'm starting to see it. 
I've exposed myself to soo many triggers and each time I get through them I feel this weird sense of empowerment, like levels in a video game and I'm now starting to crave *that* particular feeling. I didn't truthfully think it was possible.
It's still really hard, and I'm lowering my nicotine patch dosage so I'm expecting another three days of being miserable, but I actually feel strong enough for it, I think.

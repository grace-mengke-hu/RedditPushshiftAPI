Finished my last pack

Hi all,

I don't normally post on reddit, but heard good things about this community and wanted to get started somewhere.

I've smoked since I was 18 (25 now). About a half a pack a day on average, sometimes a bit more. I just switched to a gross brand per the recommendation of an app I have. Just chain smoked the last of it so that my last smoking memory would be me feeling gross and light-headed.

Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself. Not sure how long I'll stay on here, or if I'll be any help, but reading these posts should help.

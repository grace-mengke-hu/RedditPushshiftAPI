What am I supposed to do instead?

Fifth day. Cold turkey. First time I make it so far, and first time I feel so confident.

I'm trying to live it day by day, hour by hour, without thinking too much. That's why I wasn't sure it was a good idea to post here, but okay, I have two questions:

1. Is it normal that I don't feel better at all? Shouldn't I feel more energy by now? I've been smoking for 10 years and all I feel is my muscles shaking a little, I feel very tired and I'm sleeping a lot. Also, anxiety. A lot.


2. What am I supposed to do instead?! :)
I know, it's a provocative question and somehow playful, but 4-5 times a day my brain has suddenly the *brilliant* idea, while I'm waiting for something (e.g. a movie to begin, or water for my pasta to boil), of suggesting "Hey! A good cigarette would be the perfect way to pass the time!". And for a millisecond, I feel like I'm falling for it, but then I realize and turn sad... :(  So, what do you do in these sudden craving moments?

Thanks guys!

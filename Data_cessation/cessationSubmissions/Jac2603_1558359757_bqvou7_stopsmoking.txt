Obsessed with smoking!

So I have been smoke and nicotine free for 4 months and 6 days had some tough moments but got thru them. Just recently tho have been dreaming about smoking and thinking about it a lot!!! Whilst awake and how relaxing it would be to have just one!! But I know there is never just one!! As just one got me back on them after 13 years off them!!! I canâ€™t remember feeling like this last time. Any support welcome TIA ðŸ¤—

I’m a month and a half in but...

I feel like I’m going to give in any time now. On bad days: Work productivity is extremely low, noticeably slower, quality is meh; lightheaded and sleepy all day, distracted by cravings. Today was bad, and the bad days seem to be getting more frequent. I had thought it would be easier as time goes by, it should, shouldn’t it? I keep imagining myself just giving in, telling myself I won’t smoke as much as before, that I’ll just be an occasional smoker, a casual, social smoker, that I’ve got a strong enough will to stop whenever I want, I’ve proven that by getting this far, cold turkey. I know I’m trying to rationalize it and my brain is trying to trick me into giving in. And yet. The only thing stopping me is this huge bet I made with someone who’s trying to quit too. And my wife who was so proud that I quit for our newborn kid, and who’ll be deeply disappointed if I go back to smoking. And the fact that I don’t have any cigarettes with me right now. Maybe tomorrow I’ll give in. I hope not. Help.

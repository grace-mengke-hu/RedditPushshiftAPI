Withdrawals at work?

Hey Everybody, 
I'm a day into a new quit after having quit smoking for three months then getting back on vaping and smokeless tobacco for four months like a dumbass.  Regardless, I work as a tutor over breaks and have a six hour shift tonight of tutoring face to face.  Does anyone have any tips to deal with withdrawals, while still focusing and being friendly to the people I'm tutoring because in the past (have tried to quit 7-8 times) I have really bad anger and focus issues with withdrawals.  Thanks so much!

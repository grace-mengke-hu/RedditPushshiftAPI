Take my advice: Don't start vaping

I had taken up vaping 2 years ago to replace my cigarette habit. After a few months of learning the craft, I started using it as a hobby. I was vaping just about all day every day, including at work (using a "low" nicotine concentration). Vaping all day every day was just as bad of a habit as cigarettes. I wound up vaping at a 1.5 packs/day pace nicotine-wise (more than I ever smoked) and developed a relatively persistent dry cough. Plus, I still took drags off of friends' cigarettes when I was drinking. It's amazing how you can rationalize it.

It's easy to look at vaping as something that might help you quit, but quitting vaping has been just as hard as cigarettes. My triggers happen for EVERYTHING and withdrawal symptoms persisted the entirety of my first week after quitting. I still have difficulty doing some of the things that I love most, simply because I don't have my 'drugs' to help me.

For me, changing circumstances in my life have forced me to quit, and I couldn't be happier with that decision. I'm almost 9 full days in now. Cravings still suck, but I'm as committed to quitting as I've ever been in my entire life. This post isn't just a warning to others, it's a reminder to myself to keep me accountable for my actions.

Here's to a new lifestyle everyone. Stay strong!

**Edit:**
Holy... I kinda didn't realize how much this would stir up on this sub. A lot of good testimonials below, and a lot of anger as well. If anyone is curious about more of my experiences you can feel free to PM me and I'll talk with you about why I have such a love/hate relationship with vaping. Maybe I can give you more insight than you'll find here. Good luck everybody.

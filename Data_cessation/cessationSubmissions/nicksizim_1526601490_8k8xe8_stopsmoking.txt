Feeling like shit

I am smoking a pack for 9 years and im 25. 
So i stopped smoking in 2018 maybe 20 times. I always say "i'm done, that's over" but after some days i always come up with some excuses. I did not smoked for 10 days but tonight i smoked 2 roll up cigs and vaped a lot. I feel that i always have that need of smoke. And i always have to fight with it. I watched Allen Carr's series and i agree with all that but i can't fight with that need of smoke anymore. I really want to stop that meaningless habit but i just can't. I made it through 10 days and look where i stuck again. I have a major headache, lots of regret. I really don't know what to do. I was reading this sub when i crave cigs but its just turn into a nightmare. I am tracking my app to see how far i get. It's like i know this time i will fail again but i want to know how far i can get. I'm typing all this like a Gollum, looking for my ring, or to accept that i have to burn them all.

Doing nothing is better than smoking

Lots going on internally these days. Turns out quitting smoking is the tip of the iceberg and I’m reevaluating alcohol, looking at some important relationship, meditating more, and just kind of surfing a lot of “stuff” each day. It mostly feels good! 

After work yesterday I meant to go to yoga. Or if not my fave yoga class at least the gym. Instead I did nothing - didn’t even swim in my pool and it’s HOT these days - except play a stupid game in my phone.  For about *three hours* after work! I was judging myself for being basically invertebrate when I realized I was definitely feeling the pull of my backyard scene - wine and cigs. I used to love those hours.  My game playing was keeping me on my path.  Then I realized I’d much rather do nothing than smoke. And I felt happy to still be on this path and to gain some awareness that I’m protecting my quit even if I’m being somewhat shiftless.  Go me! 

Keep kicking ash, everyone!

Wasn't going to post today... then my wife did this.

So, it's becoming so normal to not smoke that I wasn't going to post on my 60 day mark.  But then my lovely wife did [this for me](http://imgur.com/EW8bnv2).  This involved coming to reddit, for the first time (okay actually second, I think she saw an AMA with Dave Grohl on Facebook or something) figured out the forum, knew that if she saw my username she'd remember it, found me to see exactly what day it would happen, and checked out enough posts to figure out the 2 was red.

Goddamn I love that woman.  I hope you all are getting support, it really helps me out to know that she wants me to be successful too.

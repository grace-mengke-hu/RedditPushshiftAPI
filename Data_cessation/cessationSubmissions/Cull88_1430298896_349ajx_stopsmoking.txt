so, after 15 days I had my first smoke...

...king dream! it was weird, i had 3 or 4 roll ups in my dream and I actually woke up dissappointed thinking "oh, ive fucked this, why did i do this?!" took surprisingly a long time to snap out of it. Very strange! I really do just want a good nights sleep, only thing thats really troubling me now

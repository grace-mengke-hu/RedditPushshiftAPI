Placing money in a jar but is it my money??

Tonight at midnight will be 2 weeks smoke free! Bn placing money in a jar of what I’m saving from smoking cigarettes. I’m financially dependent on my SO. Yes it’s his money, but he would have bought the cigarettes for me?? FYI, we have bn together for over 13 years. Do I have the right to the money I’m saving??

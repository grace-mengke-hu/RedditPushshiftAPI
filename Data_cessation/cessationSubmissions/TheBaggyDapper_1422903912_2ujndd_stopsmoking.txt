Keeping track of time.

Last week I was measuring my progress in days ; 47 days... 48 days.. right up to 49 days when a different clock kicked in and now in my head it's 7 weeks and currently gathering the days for 8 weeks. I am also aware since the month changed that a day is coming soon  when I will be able to measure in months and maybe the switch to weekly accounting is a mental preparation for a time to come when I will only  measure in months and eventually only in years. I mean it looks good on a screen an all but I am not going to be able to keep track of the days and count down to 1000 or anything and by then I won't be thinking about it every day I suppose. 

I am not sure what my point is other than that I think you reach a point where it's harder to keep track and therefore easier to think of yourself as removed from the smoking world. 

Or something.

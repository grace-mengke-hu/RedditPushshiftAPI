Voice Cracking?

I'm a 27 y.o. male. I quit smoking 9 months ago and afterward my voice started "cracking" a lot, as it did back when I went through puberty in my teens. I know that people who smoke a lot have lower voices, so I was thinking maybe after I quit my voice was changing back to normal, but 9 months have gone by and it still hasn't gotten any better. Am I alone here?

Edit: I should say that it doesn't really happen "a lot" but it does happen a few times a day. It's not like I'm the guy from the Simpsons or anything.

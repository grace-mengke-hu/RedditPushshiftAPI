Chantix?

Hey guys, sad to report that I fell off the wagon again. But happy to report that I am brushing myself off and getting back on again.

I went to see my Nurse Practitioner about a week and a half ago and she wanted me to try Chantix to help me quit smoking. Thankfully I am still on with my parents' insurance so there was 0 copay for me. I decided to try it.

I started the starter pack (.5 mg / day titrated up to 1 mg / day then up to 2 mg / day) last Sunday. So I have been on 1 mg / day for around 4 days. I've continued smoking but have noticed that cigarettes just don't taste right. My urge to smoke has gone through the floor. Overall, it is doing what it should in that regard.

However, I have had very vivid (not necessarily scary) dreams, almost every night since Sunday. I have been feeling really depressed and anxious as well (no suicidal thoughts, rest assured).

To those who have taken Chantix (or maybe those who have some scientific papers to back up what they say), did these negative effects last after you stopped Chantix? I am just scared that it will end up doing more harm in the long run than good.

FWIW, I am not expecting any medical advice from here; if things get too bad, I will simply talk to my NP and tell her what's going on. Just wanted some motivation to feel good moving forward.

What Is It Like To Quit Smoking? How Did You Quit?

A good friend of mine is trying to quit smoking and I want to support him, so I would like to understand what he's going through. I've never been a smoker myself so I'm very interested in the nut and bolts of it. How did you guys quit: patches, gum, cold turkey? What was it like physically and mentally? What made it so difficult? What can people do to help someone out who is quitting?

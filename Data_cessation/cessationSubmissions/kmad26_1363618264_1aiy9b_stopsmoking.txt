This is my 10th day without a cigarette.

Smoker for 11 years (18-29).  This is only the second time in my life I've quit cold turkey.  But, so far so good.  I'm feeling really positive about quitting.  I made it through a night of drinking without a cigarette, which was a huge hurdle.  I feel comfortable enough to ask for a badge.

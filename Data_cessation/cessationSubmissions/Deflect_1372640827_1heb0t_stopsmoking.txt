Welp, time to quit.

I started smoking when I was around 17-18, I'm 22 now.  It hasn't been that long, but I've been smoking a pack a day for the last couple years.  At this rate, I'll be dead by 40, lol.  So, yesterday I downloaded the Easy Way to Quit Smoking (audio tapes) and haven't even finished it, but convinced me enough to smoke the last few cigarettes I had and not buy them ever again.

It's hard, it does feel like I'm missing something.  I wish there was a substitute I guess.  But I'm trying, I don't want to get my hands on that deadly poison.

Confused

So, this is my third attempt at quitting. Once I managed to go 21 one days but I threw it all away because of other...substance related hobbies I had that were very much connected to cigarettes. Another time it failed because my boyfriend wasn't very determined to quit so that made it pretty hard for me. This time around we are doing it together and it's hard but we're pretty committed to having a healthy life together. 
This is my 18th day and I have to say... yesterday was NOT easy. In fact, it was a flashback of my darkest depressive moments. Everything I thought I healed, put behind me and solved came back to haunt me. Now, my main issue is that when I am very down it is very hard for me to tell that it's something that will pass. I feel like I am going to be stuck in that hellish place forever. I also tend to blame myself for all sorts of things, go back to the past to find more things to be ashamed for and torture myself with. I also feel like everything is going to come crashing down and have a tendency to punish anyone "stupid" enough to stand by my side. 
Now, I am wondering...is this really because I'm no longer smoking? Does this make sense? Because today I am actually feeling better! And the week before I didn't feel all that bad at all. Does anyone have any insight into the psychological aspect? I think it would really help me to hear what others have gone through. I KNOW that what I'm doing is good. And I also know that what WE are doing as a couple is good. But, somehow, I have a hard time being proud, feeling happy or hopeful. I have no intention of going back to smoking. None. I feel very strongly about staying on track. I feel so much better from a physical point of view! I feel stronger, I can breathe, my skin looks so much better, I can smell and taste things... I feel free. But, from a psychological point of view...it's not that easy. 
Thank you for taking the time to read my post and I wish all of you best of luck with your journey!

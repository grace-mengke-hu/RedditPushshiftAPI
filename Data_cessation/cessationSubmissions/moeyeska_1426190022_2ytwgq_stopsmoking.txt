To patch or not to patch

I'm currently on week three with using the nicotine patch and there has been a day or two where I didn't have time to go buy them so I would go the day without them and I was somewhat fine. But as soon as I put it back in I felt a rush like I just smoked and I literally have to sit down because I would get kind of dizzy. So if I'm doing okay throughout the day without one should it really be nessessary to put one on later in the day or should I try to continue going on without one. Has anyone ever had this problem. I feel like the patches are helping but then again I know I'm still putting nicotine in my body which I don't want. And has anybody that has used the patch have sleeping problems? Congrats to everyone beginning to quit smoking and congrats on everyone who continue to stop smoking.

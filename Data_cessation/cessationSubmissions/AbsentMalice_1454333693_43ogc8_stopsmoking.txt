Back away slowly... throw chocolate

Day 4 of quitting and I am cranky.  I have chewed gum until my jaw aches.  BUT, I haven't smoked.  My nose is running and I am bloated from all the water I've been drinking.  BUT, I haven't smoked.  I kicked an ATM machine for wanting the correct PIN.  My foot hurts and I feel stupid.  BUT, I haven't smoked!

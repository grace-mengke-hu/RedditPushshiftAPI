STAY ACTIVE AGAINST SMOKING

I don't think quitting is a game. I don't care about impressing my family, or saving the money, or not smelling like smoke. Cigarettes are garbage in and of themselves. They're just plain bad. Simple. They're also heavily addictive. 

I just passed three weeks (again) and it hasn't been easy. Tonight I went stir crazy and had to get out. I went to a grocery store. I swear to you, reader, I almost had tantrum in the damn store. I wanted to smoke so bad that it brought me to tears. I felt super weak (and I was). I cannot wait to get more time and distance from these damn things. In any case, this was an emotional bubble waiting to burst for about a week. It finally did, and now I feel refreshed and at ease.

When I start to fiend for a smoke, I just think -- this will be the last time I have this urge t smoke. usually the desire sticks with me, but it's wonderful when it subsides. No smokes for another day. I hope your day was better than mine.

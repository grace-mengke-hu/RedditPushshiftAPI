Almost 12 days since I stopped my 2 packs a day routine.

Over 18 yers smocking and I tried to quit so many times and ways that I stopped believing that I can. This time I went cold turkey and surprisingly I’m still going. 
The thing that I’m finding most helpful is shifting the emotional attachments, eg the certitude of relax, happy .. when smoking, to other activities. 
Meditation also helps in recognizing my cravings and stopping temptation when feeling down.
What can I say I like the updated smell, taste and energy and curious for future ones.

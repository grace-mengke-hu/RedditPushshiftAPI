I've set a quit date after 20 years of smoking

I've started on gum and in the past three days have smoked 1 cigarette a day. My quit date is the 23rd Feb -  I'd love to kick that last daily cigarette before then. I've already made sure it's not my favourite morning smoke with coffee that I have. But what now? I think the gum is taking care of the physical side but I have a significant argument going on in my head about whether to smoke 1 cigarette today.

Smoker for 2 years

I started smoking cigs about 2 years ago when a long term relationship went sour. I got in the bad habit of when things got stressful at home or at work, I'd go and have a cigarette and now that I've moved to a new state and am starting a new chapter in my life, I want to kick this horrible habit out. It has no room in this new life. I keep starting to not smoke and then when things have gotten a wee bit stressful in my new home, I slip up and smoke. I want to just quit cold turkey but am looking to hear from others who have done this, how difficult is it? What do you do to stop yourself from slipping up? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

on day 6 and having some real issues.

I am having a rough day here on 6.  I had my last cig on 3/27/14 and just spent 10 minutes in the bathroom at work crying because I don't like my job and don't want to be here.  I used to take a smoke break when that feeling came over me - which was/is about every hour.  I wanted one so bad.  I got off the shuttle from the train and the instant I walked into work I wanted a cig because I knew that the feeling was going to come, the discomfort of knowing that I am not in the right place for me.  Has anyone else gone through this?  How do you get through these emotional moments, the ones that cigarettes used to "cure?"  I have a meeting with my boss in half an hour and just want to tell him that I quit, but I can't just quit my job.  I have a family to provide for, but I really do not like my job.  Help.

30 hours in and feeling strong.

I live in the Caribbean where alcohol and cigarettes are not taxed and incredibly cheap. I've been drinking and smoking a lot. I was walking home and smoking the other night and realized that I wanted a cigarette, when I was still smoking a cigarette. 
I threw my brand new pack away and am going to really try and beat this.

One week.

I made it a week. It hasn't really been easy, but it was doable. I deal with generalized anxiety disorder and depression so obsessive thoughts were my battle this week moreso than nicotine withdrawals although I think I've got Quitter' Flu, so that kind of sucks but is a good reminder that I was destroying my body. I still hang out with my smoker friends at work because I need the break so I can vent to my friends, not the cigarette.  I guess I thought I'd feel like I accomplished something at a week, which I suppose I did, but not totally feeling it.  I went 56 days not that long ago because I found out I was pregnant (but not anymore) so I guess 7 days doesn't feel like a big deal?  I don't know. This forum and NicA is helping a lot though.  

Just needed to put this somewhere.

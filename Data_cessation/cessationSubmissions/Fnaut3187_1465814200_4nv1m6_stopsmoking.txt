Planning to quit smoking - Accountability Partner? Anyone?

Anyone interested in quitting to smoke together? 

My Introduction:
29, Male. Computer Programmer working for an International company.
I'd almost managed to quit smoking 2 years ago year. But, due to some bad stuff that happened in my life, this habit is back.
I think the success rate of quitting bad habit gets easier with a friend. Please send me a personal message if anyone's interested.

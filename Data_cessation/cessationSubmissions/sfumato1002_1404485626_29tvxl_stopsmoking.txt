Getting really strong cravings

Maybe it is because for the last couple of weeks I have been thinking about smoking again. So now it seems like I just quit, my cravings are like the first days. I am thinking of smoking in moderation, i used to smoke 10 a day..so now I am thinking 3-5. Life is just to hard for me without smokes, I love smoking, I quit because of this girl I was infatuated with that hated smoking...but it did not work out...now I am alone and without smoking...I need some enjoyment, the urges to smoke are just getting stronger, I feel I am going to relapse any day.

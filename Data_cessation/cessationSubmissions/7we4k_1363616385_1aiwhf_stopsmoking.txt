3 Weeks!  Questions inside.

Sitting at 23 days right now, feeling good, the patch has been working pretty nice.  

Couple questions:  

*  Chewing on straws:  I'm starting to grind my teeth in my sleep, which is really starting to hurt.  I had to take nyquil and ibuprofen to sleep last night.  What would you guys recommend to replace the straws with?  I can't do too much candy, and cannot stand twizzlers since my last quit 9 years ago.

*  For other patch users, when did you start using the lower dosage patches?  I've been on the 21 mg/ 24 hour ones for three weeks now, and am curious on when to drop to the 14 mg ones?  

Good luck to everyone out there!

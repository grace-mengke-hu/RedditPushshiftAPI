Question about lozenges

I looked up the nicotine content in a cigarette and see that it is 0.6mg for an American spirit yellow (my brand). I would have about 1 per hour  when I smoked. I switched to vaping and having roughly the same amount of nicotine but I'm ready to quit. However, the lowest lozenges are 2mg and say to have one every 1 to 2 hours. Isn't that double to quadruple the amount of nicotine I'm usually getting?

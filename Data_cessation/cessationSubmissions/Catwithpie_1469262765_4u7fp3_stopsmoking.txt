Not sure how to feel today

I've smoked a pack a day for probably around ten years. Tried quitting multiple times and failed, as the story goes. However, 12 days ago I started using a vape. Not one of these fancy box mods, which I tried previously. Just a simple little object. I haven't used tobacco since I began, which is good. But I know I'm still addicted to the nicotine. My idea is to taper off after a while. Already I have cut the cost of smoking in half which is certainly nice, but I'd like to be rid of this altogether soon. In a sense I feel accomplished, yet in another I feel like I am still a slave. Anybody else?

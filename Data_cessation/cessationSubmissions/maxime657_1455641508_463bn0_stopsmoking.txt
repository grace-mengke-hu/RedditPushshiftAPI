Day 1, Let me succeed this time.

I'm 19 years old and I have been smoking for over 5 years now. I've tried quitting a couple of times but I failed eveytime. I really hope it's gonna happen this time. If you have some tips, please share them with me, I need all the support and help I can get.
Thanks, ;)

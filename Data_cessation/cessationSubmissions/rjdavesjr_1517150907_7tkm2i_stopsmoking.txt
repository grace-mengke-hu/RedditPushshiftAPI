The Quitter Who Won

&gt; Quitters never win and winners never quit

That was my reply to every person who told me to quit smoking and  today will mark the day that I've become the happiest loser. 

I'm tired.

I'm tired of walking up a flight of stairs breathing like I just ran a marathon.

I'm tired of relying on the nicotine to calm random anxieties I get.

I'm tired of spending countless dollars every day for a pack.

I'm tired of waking up in the morning feeling like an elephant is sitting on my chest.

I'm tired cigarettes being on my mind more than what is really important.

If quitters never win and winners never quit, then I'm tired of winning and losing the addiction will never feel so victorious.

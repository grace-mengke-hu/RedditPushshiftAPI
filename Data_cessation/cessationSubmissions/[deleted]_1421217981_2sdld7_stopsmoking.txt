Pen pal / sponsor

I've seen this posted before but thought I'd ask on my own. Sorry if it's posted somewhere I'll take this down if I find it.

I've quit multiple times for months at a time and always cave back in. I've been smoking regularly for the past 7 years (24 now), and just looking for some help on quitting permanently.

There is a ton of support here and I'm so happy it has worked for many people. For me personally I don't find the general "you're strong and I believe in you" banter to be useful. Most if not all of you don't know me and I don't want you to pretend you do. I'm looking for someone, preferably Pacific coast, to talk to when I get a craving to help me through it. Someone on a personal level that wouldn't mind just talking through it sometimes.

Thank you for any and all responses and best of luck to all you previously, currently, and past my point of nicotine freedom.

Have a great night all.

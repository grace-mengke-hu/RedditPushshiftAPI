I quit for 5 months and started again

I quit cold turkey and started again (2 months ago) I'm pretty ashamed of myself and I can feel the difference in my lungs. It was my first attempt at quitting and I let stress get to me and told myself that once I had a cigarette it would make everything better. I have 4 left in my pack and  I'm tempted to flush them down the toilet. Any advise or kind words would be appreciated.

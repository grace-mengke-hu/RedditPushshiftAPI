Made It!

Longest I have been without nicotine in 24 years. Tried every method known to man several times over. This time I told myself that all I needed was 2 days. 2 days without nicotine and it was too far to turn back. So yes the rest of the time sucked. Day 14-40 were dark dark days but I knew I would not take 1 puff no matter what.

The key differences this time was that I took Chantix, started exercising, and really made up my mind. Chantix for 15 days then quit. After 2 days of quitting I stopped taking Chantix and hugged the suck.

I know there will be bad days but the worst is over and its nice having more control of my life again. Smoking is not a winning strategy.

Help me quit this shit.

So for the past two weeks I have been battling a bad cold. Which means I have barely been able to smoke. I light one up pretty much  every day cause my brain misses it and wants the nicotine but I haven't been able to inhale without coughing my lungs out and looking/feeling like fool. 
So, I think this might be a great opportunity to finally pull the plug and quit permanently. My dad who smoked for like 35 years was able to kick it this way about 10 year ago, so why wouldn't I, who have been smoking regularly for less than 5, be able to pull it off. So now I am asking for your tips, advice or just your general wisdom about making this change and starting a healthier future.

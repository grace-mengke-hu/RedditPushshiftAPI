wanna help my brother stop smoking

he doesn't listen and half the time gives me the 'sure yea k' treatment without doing anything. he's always been instinctive and more often that not refuses to listen. don't really know to tell him he'll die if he keeps going. maybe i can use violence but honestly, i prefer not to.

Today is day one (Again)

I am completely disgusted with myself as I resubscribe and update my stop date. I would have been 637 days if I had kept up my quit. I would have felt so much better. I would have had so much more money. I would be so much skinnier. Well today I am at 1 day. I am not going to fail again.

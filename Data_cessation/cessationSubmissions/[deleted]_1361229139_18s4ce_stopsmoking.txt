Two weeks

I am happy to be a no-smoker for two weeks. This time I am sure about what I want. I do not want to be a smoker and I feel no ambivalence. The addict part of my brain sure have a few tricks but I will resist. Some of the tricks are pure evil thoughts like «I will start again someday anyway, I am a worthless shit, nothing matters, maybe it is ok if I just die a slow death, I might as well start smoking». Now I am aware of this evil and sneaky addict inside me and those thoughts goes away if I just focus on what I really want. Also those evil thoughts are lies. I want to be a healthy non-smoker and those sigarettes do me no good at all. With the right mindset the past two weeks have not been too hard. I have not missed the cigarettes at all. I have had cravings, the evil thoughts, also I have felt lot unrest. I think the unrest also has to do with caffein overdosing ([The impact of caffeine use on tobacco cessation and withdrawal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022872)), as well as nicotin withdrawal symtoms. I am cutting down my caffein consumtion and also I guess the 'normal nicotine withdrawal symtoms are getting less. Anyway, I am getting calmer these days and that is a very good feeling. Hurra!

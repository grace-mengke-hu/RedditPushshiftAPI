21 days, without having coughed anything up at all?

I'm on day 21, and it's great. Thing is, I haven't coughed anything up, nothing at all. I never had a smoker's cough, but coughing stuff up seems to be a shared experience around here, so....where is all my tarred-up phlegm actually going?

I smoked enough, for long enough, that I am sure my lungs are black as sin.

267 days, did you quit yet ? no ? come in

So here I am almost 267 days quit cold turkey, did I really plan it ? not really. I didn't really trusted my self, I had to put things into perspective. I needed to kill this child within that was hanging too tightly to every time-wasting health-degrading habit.

My biggest hurdle was on the first week I was about to cave, but what kept me going was that I no longer wanted to be my past self.

Being a non smoker released me from my past, my fears, my attachments to parts of my personality that I just did not want to let go. 

Being a non smoker is a gift to me, I did not realize it at first but with time so many things I thought were good were actually bad. I badly needed to transition from a needy adult to a supportive adult.

Take charge of your life, don't default to your habits.

Thank you /r/quitsmoking.

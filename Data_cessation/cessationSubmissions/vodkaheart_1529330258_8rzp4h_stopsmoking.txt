Quitting when your significant other still smokes?

So I was never exactly a -heavy- smoker. There were days when I'd only smoke one or two cigs, but there were also days when I'd blow through a pack, usually in a social situation. My boyfriend is a heavy smoker, and smokes about a pack to two packs a day. I got really sick last week and haven't smoked since (about 9 days). I've quit cold turkey a few times before without any withdrawal issues, but never when I'm with someone who smokes heavily. 


I'm a little nervous about A) telling him that I'm trying to quit and B) how I'll react when he smokes around me. He's very supportive of me, and I know he won't be shitty about it, but I'm worried that he might feel guilty about smoking around me, and that I might feel tempted to join him. I have an e-cigarette, which helps, but of course it's not exactly the same. Plus, I live in Germany, so pretty much EVERYONE smokes no matter where you go. 


Thoughts on what to do in this situation??

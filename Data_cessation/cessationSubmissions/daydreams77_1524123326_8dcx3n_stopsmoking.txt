I'm 22 and started when I was 12. Feel like I can't quit

First time posting here. Basically smoking has been part of who I am for so long, it's been a factor in who my friends are, and it's so ingrained in my day to day routine. My boyfriend smokes and he lives with me. I have tried chantix about 2 years ago and it did help a good bit but I never quit obviously. Basically it just seems impossible and now I've really started noticing the effects. I've wanted to quit for a long ass time and I know it would improve my life and health. Any advice is appreciated.

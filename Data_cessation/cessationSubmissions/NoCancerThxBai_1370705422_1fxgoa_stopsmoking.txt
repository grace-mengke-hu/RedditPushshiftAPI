Okay, Day One Begins, Again!

Sorry for the throwaway, but my wife knows my reddit ID. She is borderline anosmic, and doesn't know I've been smoking consistently since March, after having quit for two years.

She would also kill me if she found out I started smoking again.

So, secretly quitting again. It's pretty close to the last time, so hopefully won't be horrible. Wish me luck.

Got past two days, almost broke yesterday night but i held it together.

In the last two days I went through 3 packs of gum and a full bag of sunflower seeds, they kept my mind and mouth busy through the day.
However, when it came time to go to bed, i was overwhelmed with a  craving attack, literally could not think of anything other than having a smoke. Had it not been for this subreddit, as well as a motivational app on my phone i would have done it and it took all my will power not to.
The craving eventually subsided, they say it only lasts 3 minutes, it felt a lot longer than that, although i didn't check, none the less i am making my way through day 3, stronger than ever. 
Keep strong fellow quitters, we ca beat it!

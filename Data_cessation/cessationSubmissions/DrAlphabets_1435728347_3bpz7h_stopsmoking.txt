Just overcame temptation!

I'm moving today and so I recruited a couple friends to help me by promising pizza and beer. We've had a little bit to drink (nothing too crazy guys) and so my brother and one of my smoker friends are outside smoking but I was able to say no to the cigarette and just sit down on reddit for a minute instead! What a better use of my time

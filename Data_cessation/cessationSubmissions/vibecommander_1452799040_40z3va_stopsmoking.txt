Need feedback from smokers! The clinic I work at is trying to improve tobacco cessation counseling. Do you mind testing the usability of our new intake survey?

I work for a primary care practice in Atlanta, Georgia. As one of our 2016 goals, our head physician wants to gather more information on our patients who use tobacco, so we can personalize their care.

-

If you have time, please take our 3 minute intake survey and offer your feedback on a brief 4 question follow-up survey.

-

Help us make sure we are being mindful of tobacco user needs! Also, feel free to use a fictitious name and survey responses. I'm just want to know whether the survey is simple to use. 

-

*Recognizing that most of the users on this thread are former smokers, if you would still like to help, please approach the survey from the perspective of a current smoker.

Finally good signs 20 days in!

22 days in-

Over the last few days my appetite has drastically increased to the point where I actually eat 4-5 meals a day! Not overeating or junk food either, i have been reading about nutrition and eating very well! 

I saw no change at all from quitting until now so its really good to see a tangible benefit. Just putting this out for anyone else who's impatient - stick with it.

Already want to thank you guys so much

I know I've only just started my long (amazing) journey ahead, but I wanted to express my biggest thank yous to this community already. Every time I've wanted a smoke (which to be honest, hasn't been many, thanks to the Alan Carr book suggestion...) I've jumped on here and read your posts, and they've kept me so motivated.

I went out with some friends who are all smokers to a bar last night, and I knew this would be a huge test to myself - and I passed with flying colours! Not only did I not have a cigarette, but I joined them in the smoking area and not one thought passed to put a smoke in my hand. I could enjoy their company without destroying my body, and that was an amazing realisation. 

Really looking forward to feeling my body get better and better - already I feel like I have more energy, and my coughing is cutting down (and sounds no where near as bad)...I might actually enjoy winter this year :) 

THANKS SO MUCH GUYS!

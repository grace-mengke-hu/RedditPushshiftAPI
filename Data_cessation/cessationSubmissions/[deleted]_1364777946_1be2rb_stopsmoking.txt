This is my first attempt to stop smoking. I'm afraid that I will fail.

I decided that it is time for me to stop smoking. I've had issues with my stomach and lungs for the last couple of weeks (I'm quite sure that both of them are caused by smoking), and my larynx has been hurting for a few days now. :/ I'm getting worried.. my health hasn't been the best lately. 

I've never really tried to stop smoking before. I was trying to smoke less a few times, but it never really worked out. I'm quite afraid that I won't even manage to stop it for 24h, let alone longer. I'm not the most ambitious person.

I joined this subreddit because I know that I'll need help if i want to be successful.

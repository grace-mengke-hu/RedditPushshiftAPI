Just got to a week, and although I'm happy I'm not going to celebrate yet.

This is my second time quitting in as many years. I'd been smoking for 10 years before reading a book about habits by Charles Duhigg and deciding that it was something I could do. Lo and behold, it wasn't that bad! Thinking of contingencies for high stress situations, building new havits to replace the old ones, and understanding the schiencw behind my addiction, all of itnwas easy and effective; it was so effective that I underestimated my addiction. After three months, in spite of my best judgement, I started smoking while at the bar. I tried the whole social smoking thing, sure I wouldn't fall back into it. A month later I was a full time smoker again, and here I am, a year later, back at square one. 


One week in and the withdrawl is kicking my ass, but this time my lizard brain will lose.

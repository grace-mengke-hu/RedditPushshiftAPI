Weird question. I'm almost 7 weeks smoke free. I can FEEL my blood pumping. Is this normal?

Hey everyone, I'll be 7 weeks smoke free on Friday! I smoked for over 15 years, quit a million times, but never more than 2 weeks or so. I used Allen Carr's Easy Way and I feel very confident I will never be a smoker again. Anyway, I have found in the last couple weeks that I can FEEL my blood pumping through my body and feel my heart beating. It's very weird, it keeps me up a little bit at night. A couple things to note, I'm a little over 300 lbs and since I quit smoking I have been exercising and losing weight. I feel great overall, but the blood pumping thing is really freaking me out. Is this a normal thing since my circulation is improving? Should I be concerned?

I want to quit today.

Over the last few months I've been fantasizing about quitting. I'm 23 and have been smoking since I was 13. 
I was able to quit hard drugs at age 18 after a 2 year addiction to opiates, but quitting cigarettes seems too difficult for some reason!

With smoking, I feel like I can have a "time out" every few hours from life. When I take a smoke break, I'm able to stop stop time and just relax. Thats the only thing I will really miss.

How do you guys replace that in your life? My experience with addiction is that I need to replace it with something healthy, the void in my life that cigarettes fill. 

Can anyone give me some advice?
I don't want to smoke anymore.

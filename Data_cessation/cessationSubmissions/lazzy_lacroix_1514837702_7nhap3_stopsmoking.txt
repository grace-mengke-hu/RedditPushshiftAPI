Day 10

Using Quit Smoking app and this is mission #10. Feel the best I have all year, amazed I made it through New Years Eve without smoking. Proud of myself for this one. Quit smoking for 2.5 years and started again in May and it was right back where I left off. Except feeling wayyyy shittier. Not sure if I can call myself a non-smoker yet? Doesn't feel real yet.

Anyone experienced abnormal bloat? If so how long does it take to go away?

Hello,

This is about my 10 time quitting or maybe more. Longest I went was about 1 year and I would go on an off. Now I am 19 days down. Overall I am healthy, I work out, eat right, take ginger, fiber ,etc.

I've actually managed to get more tone but my stomach looks bigger and I'm wondering how long does this take to go away if you have had it?

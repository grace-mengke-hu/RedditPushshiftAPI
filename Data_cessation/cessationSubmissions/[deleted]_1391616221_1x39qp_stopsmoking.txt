Health problems and quitting

Was wondering if anyone had an experience similar to mine. 

I have essentially given up cigarettes. I went an entire week (Mon-Fri) and then caved and had a couple over the weekend. That happened twice in a row. Now I'm committed to giving them up for good after I noticed just how drastically even a couple of cigarettes impacts my health.

I have occasional issues in my leg with a vericose vein. When I smoke even one cigarette it wreaks havoc on this. The swelling/pain comes back immediately and drastically worse. Generally, this is not even an issue. 

More concerning though are the respiratory issues I've faced. Even after smoking 1-2 cigarettes, I would wake up that night having difficulty breathing, coughing up mucus, etc. I was afraid I'd given myself COPD. (Background: I'm 27 and have been a light smoker for about 4-5 years. Light as in averaging probably 2 cigarettes per day, with stretches of not smoking at all for months at a time). 

However, after being cigarette-free for 3 days, I can breathe just fine. No respiratory issues, etc. I was wondering if anyone else had seen such significant health impacts from light smoking?

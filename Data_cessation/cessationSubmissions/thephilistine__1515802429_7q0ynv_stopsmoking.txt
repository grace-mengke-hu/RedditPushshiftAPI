2000 days! Doesn't feel that long but this feels damn good.

I don't come here as much as I used to but I just wanted to check in and say keep at it.  The days will really add up and it gets way easier with time.  Those voices in your head die down and go nearly completely away.  Besides, they're liars and powerless without your assistance.  

FYI, I still do get dreams where I smoke and feel guilty about it like I've cheated myself.  But they're just that, dreams.  I am now, have been for a long while, and will forever be, nicotine free.

Keep at it people.  You can do it if you really want to.

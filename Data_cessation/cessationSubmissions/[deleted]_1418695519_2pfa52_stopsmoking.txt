Quit about 3 months ago and am writing a term paper for the first time since I stopped. Haven't had cravings for a long time but am having intense ones.

I've been through lots of stressful situations since I quit without breaking down and smoking. I guess the ritual of smoking while writing huge papers and pulling all nighters is pretty deeply ingrained though.  

What do you guys do in place of smoking when you're performing long tedious tasks like writing or coding?

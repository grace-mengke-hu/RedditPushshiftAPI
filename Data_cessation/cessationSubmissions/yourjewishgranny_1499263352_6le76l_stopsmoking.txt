day 5 of quitting >5 cigarettes/day + first day back at work = so angry

I never imagined my 5 cigarette a day habit would be such a pain to end. I'm on day 5 cold turkey and am experiencing a new level of anger I didn't know existed! I hated that I smoked and kept it a secret from almost everyone.

I just keep reminding myself that it's been 5 days, if I smoked right now it will taste horrible and make me feel awful.

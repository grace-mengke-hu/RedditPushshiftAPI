Quick Question Regarding Quitting and My Dog

So, I've quit before, for three years, and started back up about three years ago. It's fucking time to kick it again with Alan Carr!

So, for those of you who are dog owners, maybe you've got some advice. My pup comes out with me every time I go to smoke to take a leak or whatever, what have you done to replace that if you were in a similar situation? When I quit, it's going to throw his whole world off and I want to combat that as much as possible.

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for the support and suggestions!

I'll be using my Vitamix a bit more to make juice and such since I've always got fruit and veggies on hand. Now, evey time I want to smoke, I'll just make some awesome smoothie and step out while I drink it! The pup will love the extra treats he gets, we'll both be outside, and sooo, EVERYONE WINS!

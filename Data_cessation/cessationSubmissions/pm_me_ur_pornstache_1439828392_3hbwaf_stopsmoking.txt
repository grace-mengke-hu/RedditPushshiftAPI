Day 1 - Do you believe in me? I believe in me...

Aside from hating all things, being jittery, not being able to think straight, and that constant urge that won't go away, this isn't so bad.

It's something I've been meaning to do for a long, long time.  I want to get fit, and I can't do that right now.  I can't hardly breathe, I've been smoking for 5 years.  It's just time.  I stopped temporarily for about a year or so, but that wasn't for me.  It was, but it wasn't (there was a girl involved).  I want to say this time is different than all my other attempts.  I want to say that I've been making positive changes in my life and this is just another one.

But deep down inside, where I don't tell people how much I'm afraid of my depression, where I don't tell people how afraid I am that smoking is the only thing keeping it at bay (that toxic cocktail of chemicals), I'm afraid of failing again.  And that is the worst kind of cowardice - the paralysis of "Why bother? You'll only fail again."

This time it's different.  This time there is no girl pushing me to drop smoking.  This time there's no outside influence encouraging me to make this change.  This time is a decision, not a motivation.  You can't fail at making a decision, right?  "I've decided I'm no longer a smoker, and people who aren't smokers don't smoke."

I've got a vape, to get me through the worst of it, I guess.  I still can't think straight, feels like my head is in a fog and I'm just rambling on and on.  The way I feel is just more evidence that I've screwed with my brain chemicals and need to stop encouraging it.  I miss not being addicted to anything.

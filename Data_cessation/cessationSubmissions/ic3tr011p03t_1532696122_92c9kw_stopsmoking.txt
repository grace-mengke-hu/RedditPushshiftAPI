Can't Seem to Stop

I've tried to quit so many times over the years. I've tried patches, lozenges, cold turkey and replacing my cigs with gum or hard candies, wellbutrin (never again, I couldn't sleep at all)...I've tried a stop smoking program to get all these things and I've tried buying them with my own money to help motivate myself...I've tried recording the money I spend exactly and budgeting against it...everything I can think of.

I always end up smoking again. The longest I went without them was a few months, then I always convince myself that it's okay to have one in the morning with coffee and it escalates from there.

I feel like such a failure. I've stopped telling my wife when I'm going to try to quit because I know she doesn't believe me.

I just wanted to vent. I really hate that I haven't been able to make myself right.

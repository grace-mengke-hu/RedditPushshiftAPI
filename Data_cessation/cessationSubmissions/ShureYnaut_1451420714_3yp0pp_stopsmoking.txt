My New Years Resolution

I have smoked about a pack a day since I was 18 (I'm 26 now) and I've had enough.  I met a cute girl at a Christmas party about a week ago and we hit it off, but when I called her to ask her out she told me straight up "normally, I would love to, but I don't date smokers."  Honestly I understand where she is coming from, and the more I smoke, the more I realize what a stupid thing I'm doing to myself.

I've decided to start my New Year's resolution early, and I have had my last cigarette of 2015, hopefully forever.  I know you guys have been an incredible source of support for others and despite still smoking, I frequently visit the sub just to see how others are faring at quitting.  I'm going to need all the help I can get, and I hope if nothing else I can look to this community for support and guidance.

Here's to a smoke-free 2016!!

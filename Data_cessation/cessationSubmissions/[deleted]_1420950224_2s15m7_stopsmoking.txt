According to Alan Carr, the fear of giving up keeps people smoking. I don't agree.

I'm not scared of giving up cigarettes. I am scared of sharks, and scared of being taken hostage in a 7-11 by some prick with shitty trigger discipline and a poorly maintained pistol. But, I am bored. Incredibly, utterly, stupendously bored. And I'm not a knitter, jigsaw puzzle doer, karate class attender, or whatever other hobby I'm supposed to take up. 

Also, I'm tired. Tired of doing everything I did before, but having to add on "don't think about smoking" to my every thought, action, and second of every day, which doesn't really work. 

And food for thought: why don't tobacco companies invest money in curing cancer? If they did that, I'd smoke 10 packs a day. Just saying. 

Edit: Why is it okay to be a functional alcoholic or cocaine user but not a smoker?

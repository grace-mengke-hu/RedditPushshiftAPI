Finally quitting today

Started smoking at 15, now 24, and was up to a pack per day at 19. In the past 2 weeks I have started working out regularly and now it's time to drop smoking. My concern is definitely the weight gain I have noticed other experience. I am 15 pounds overweight for my height and have dropped 3 since my workout pattern has become consistent. Is there some way to stop gaining weight? If it is simply replacing food for a smoke what have you done to avoid that "go-to"?

Replaced smoking with eating?

I’m 4 weeks in to giving up smoking (20 a day) and it has gone mostly well so far barring the occasional puff on a weekend after a drink, however I can’t control my appetite at all. I have heard that people eat a little more after quitting but I thought that after a month it would have started to ease off now. Does anyone have any advice or went through something similar? I’m worried I’ve swapped one addiction for another!

Hi, I want to help my Mom.

So here's the thing. My Mom, a somewhat healthy looking very hardworking 47 year-old, smokes everytime she uses the bathroom to pass her bowels. She's been doing this for longer than i know. How can I stop her habit? Obviously I can't just barge in there and take it out of her mouth. I don't know what to do or what to say to her. The thought of losing a mother is scary, but the thought of losing her sooner is terrifying. I do not want to let my mom die from a problem caused by her smoking habit. I want to change her. Help her. Help me. Please, give me advice on. how to deal with her.

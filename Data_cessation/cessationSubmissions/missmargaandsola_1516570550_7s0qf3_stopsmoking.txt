What do you do when you're stressed?

Been smoke free for almost a month and half. Fantastic. I feel great, i can run faster, have better skin, lose weight  more efficiently and i now have really pink lips. :)

However, i'm graduating college in June, and my undergrad thesis is driving me crazy. The anxiety is freakin killing me cause this is a make it or break it. I wake up early everyday, do yoga every morning and stay hydrated. But the stress sometimes turns me into a really grumpy monster.. like i can get really mean towards the people around me. (Btw i am a super chill person) i used to smoke a lot because of stress but now, as an ex smoker idk how to deal with it. People tell me to keep healthy and run, etc but i cant go running everytime i get stressed. Help :(

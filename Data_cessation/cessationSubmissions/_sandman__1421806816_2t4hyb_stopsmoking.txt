Suffering.

Hey guys. I quit smoking over a week ago. I know my badge says six days but I applied for it a little late. Anyway, I am really in the thick of it over here. I have had problems with depression in the past, but this is honestly horrible. Does anyone have any similar experience with these sort of major depressive symptoms occurring after cessation? I have no interest in doing the things I normally love doing, and am over analyzing every aspect of my relationship with my SO, in spite of the fact she has been nothing but supportive during this time. I don't want to see my friends and feel completely isolated here. I only smoked for about 6 months, but by the end of it I was smoking more than a pack a day while living in Germany. I hope this gets better, and soon. Anyway, thanks for reading. You guys are great.

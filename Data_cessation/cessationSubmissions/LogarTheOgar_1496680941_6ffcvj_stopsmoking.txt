I want a cigarette, but I don't want a cigarette, I want what it represents:

Text wall incoming--

It's Day 36: I had crappy dreams that made me miserable all morning. It's miserable outside. I generally don't feel well. I'm sluggish, sweaty from work, my knees hurt and the only Tinder match I have is someone 8 years younger than me (this is the funny bit not the cry for help.) I'm hungry but already full, and bored but have plenty to do at work.

I want cigarettes. Cigarettes are perfect for me. They're the ultimate escape, the ultimate "fuck it," the "I'm just gonna do whatever." The walk outside and make myself feel a little better. The smoke cigarettes until the sun comes up feeling.

I can't seem to escape this line of thinking. 36 days is the furthest I've gotten in a long time and now I'm actually considering just turning around and going back.

I'll light up and think YEP, the world is shit, and I'm shit, and we're all shit, and we're gonna do a bunch of dumb shit because we're humans and we're dumb as shit!

It's this crutch I put everything on. "If I could just quit smoking, I could get it together. I could actually exercise and get in shape and get shit done. I wouldn't be tired all the time and..." blah blah blah. None of it's true. I'm still always tired. I'm still cranky all the time. I still don't actually like my job or most other things. People say things like "oh you just gotta go DO stuff" and I'm like "OK well what" and they say "well I don't know--" and I say exactly, now leave me alone.

Now that I don't have the crutch, I don't have anything to blame my problems on except that fact that I don't actually feel like doing anything about them, and there's nothing I can put in my body to make me feel better about it.

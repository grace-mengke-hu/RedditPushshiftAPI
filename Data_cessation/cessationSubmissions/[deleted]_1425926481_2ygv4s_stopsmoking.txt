I think I quit

Hi reddit,
so I'm being sick (just the flu) for more than one week now and didn't touch any cigarettes after 5 years of smoking. Just because my sick body didn't feel any urge to.
I'm thinking about quitting, because I probably have a headstart, but the will isn't really there. I feel way better today and there was a slight urge to smoke, in wich I gave in, smoked half a cigarette and threw it away as it tasted disgusting.

So I think I quit, this is my resolution and this flair my counter. We will see, where this leads me...

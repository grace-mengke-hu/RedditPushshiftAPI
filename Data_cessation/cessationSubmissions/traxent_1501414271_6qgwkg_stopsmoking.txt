Thinking about going back to smoking

I am 11 days into this not smoking cigarettes thing.  I switched to vaping and it's been great, but today I've had so much hassle with leaking tank and flooded coils, I almost opened a pack of cigarettes.  I guess I'm still on the fence about quitting.  I need motivation to keep going.  I have only seen small things change like my sense of smell and taste getting better, but when I start craving, I could care less about that.  I don't feel any different, healthier, or see improvement in my teeth or dark circles.  I guess I'm a little depressed.  Any suggestions?

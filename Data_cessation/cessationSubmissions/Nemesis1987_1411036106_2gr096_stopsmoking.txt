Day three starts now.

I'm 27 years old and I've been smoking for 15 years, this is my first valiant attempt in 11 years to stop.  I am having a very hard time with the habit part of things. Like, I based a lot of things around making time for a smoke. But now I am feeling lost when I'm at home and lost when break time happens at work. 

Every time I get up I wanna go outside and have a cigarette. The anxiety then proceeds to kick in and I try to tell myself one smoke wont hurt. But I haven't given in yet. I dont know what to expect posting this, but it's hard. 

My girlfriend quit with me, but she was a social smoker so it was easy for her. She doesnt understand how difficult it is with a legitimately strong addiction. I guess I just need some pointers on how to deal with the hard times of the day. 

Thanks.

Day 3 (4), going strong!

I decided to join my smoking buddies at work for break time. I'm really happy to say that I didn't smoke and was barely tempted. I had about 20 seconds where I thought "ah, just a drag couldn't hurt". Then I remembered how shitty it feels to smoke! We can all get over this addiction!

Day 3, could use some encouragement and stories of you guys making it past day 3 please

Basically self explanatory. I don't feel like I'm gonna cave but good god I feel miserable and I feel like it's never gonna let up.

So yeah, I'd really appreciate some encouragement, or assurances that people do make it and it gets better from here (if it does!), if you can please. :)

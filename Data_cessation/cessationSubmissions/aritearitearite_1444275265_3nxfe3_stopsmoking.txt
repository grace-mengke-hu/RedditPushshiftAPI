I quit 2 weeks ago and am feeling depressed lately

Cold turkey.  Very stressed with school and career stuff so not being able to go for a smoke sucks.  I don't even want or crave a smoke---i just want my break.  Smoking to me was my vacation everyday. I find myself going for walks or going outside regardless.   I just don't have any "coping" mechanism right now for stress.  Can anyone relate?  Any tips?

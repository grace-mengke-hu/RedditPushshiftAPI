FIRST STAR! PRAISE THE EMPEROR!

Yesterday makes one complete month of keeping clear. Some of my friends have already relapsed, some have justified smoking with "Well, it's only 2 or 3, right?"

I have not. I've only been to my old smoking area once, because a friend wanted to talk. I didn't want a smoke and I was actually uncomfortable being there. I've been back at the gym for a few weeks, just walking hard for now, and I'm starting to see the changes. I have more money which I'm saving to put towards a new washer/dryer (since I'm renting one) and I'm starting to look for a dog (because DOG!).

I feel much better than I have, with less depression and more positive energy than while I was smoking. I can smell the flowers near my office and the smokers in their own cars while I'm in traffic. One of those objects smells stale.

Keep it up! You can do it! I am right there with you!

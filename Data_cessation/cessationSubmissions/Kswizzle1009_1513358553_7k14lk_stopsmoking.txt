Today marks my 1 month smoke free.

Seriously 1 month?! It’s insane I smoked everyday for about 8-9 years and now I’m a non smoker. It really blows my mind.

I have to be completely honest with you guys one night I had a few too many drinks and took a couple of puffs, but I didn’t wake up feeling like shit or defeated. I was just like whatever I’m still not a smoker.

The step I took a month ago has created a ripple affect in my life. I quit smoking, then cut out all prossessed foods (including sugar), then I cut down my drinking, then I started going to the gym five days a week, then I stopped watching so much tv a week so now I only listen to motivational videos or I read. 

My life is COMPLETELY different than what it was a month ago. All because I chose to stop smoking. I’m 25 years old and I have not ran since I was in high school and now I’m running on the treadmill for “fun”. I’m so much happier with my life now and I have no intentions on looking back.

So if you’re reading this and you’re still stuck in that first 2 weeks! I promise you it gets better and you’ll be so happy and proud of yourself that you stuck it out! Good luck to everyone!!!

Smoking with a cold

I have a cold right now, with a sinus infection.  It's been lingering for a little over a week and slowly getting better.

It made me think of that feeling of lighting up and smoking when I was sick.  It was so gross, but the addiction was so strong.  I'm hanging onto that memory of how terrible smoking with a cold was.  I'm glad to be free of cigarettes.  They suck.

I'm still struggling a bit with being a non smoker, but it's a worthwhile struggle.

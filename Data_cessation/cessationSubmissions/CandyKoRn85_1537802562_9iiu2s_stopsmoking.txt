3 Months Today

This is my first time posting but I've been periodically checking in here for a while now. This is the first time I feel it's "safe" to post that I've quit.

I'm still getting the occasional nightmare about starting smoking again - I've been told that never goes away?
Some times I still miss it, but it doesn't last long and when I think about all of the positives of stopping it just makes me happy I did.

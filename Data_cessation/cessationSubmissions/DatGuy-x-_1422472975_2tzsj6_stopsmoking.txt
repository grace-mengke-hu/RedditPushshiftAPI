Got me a 5

Wow, look at that. I only noticed because I opened the app on my phone just now and saw the 150.

How time flies, I really don't think about smoking at all anymore. Even when I pass someone on the street who is smoking...it smells different and not appealing at all now.

I'm not as tired anymore, I have way more free time, my bank account is growing and I'm healthier everyday...especially since I'm at around 107 days of not drinking as well.

Stick with it folks, it gets easier rather quickly and feels great to break free.

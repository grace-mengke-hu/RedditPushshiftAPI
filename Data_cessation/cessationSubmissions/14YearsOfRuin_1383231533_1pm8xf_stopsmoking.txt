I am sick of poisoning myself.

I am a nicotine addict and it is destroying me one cigarette at a time. Once upon a time I was the image of a healthy human being, and excelling at everything I put my mind to. Then I began to drink, and soon thereafter smoke, and I have been systematically destroying my life ever since. I quit last year with the help of Mr. Carr's book, for more than nine months. Then came a night where everything went wrong, and in an effort to hurt myself, I forced myself to smoke. And now here we are, back to square one. I've had enough though. I just wanted to say that somewhere where I won't expect a "yeah right" reply. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Best of luck with your own path as well. It feels good to be a non-smoker again.

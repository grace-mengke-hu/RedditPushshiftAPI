started yesterday. staying strong

I was in my truck about to leave for work. Took out my smokes. I've always been meaning to quit. I got one ready to smoke and took the first puff. I looked at it and just crushed it up. Decided I was done. Soon as I got to work, I crushed the box and threw it away. It sucks right now, but I know that I will be strong. As long as I have my green tea, I will survive. Long. Live. Green tea.

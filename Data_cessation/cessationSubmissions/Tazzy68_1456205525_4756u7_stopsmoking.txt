Why did I quit?

I am a 31 year smoker and a 24 day non smoker and I hate my life!!! I thought the first two days were bad...today has been the worst! When do I truly stop being a smoker.  A non smoker doesn't wake up and think of smoking all day long. Haven't actually smoked but it is really all I think about....one big fat drag. I went to the local grocery store, today, saw a homeless person with her sign and that smoke hanging out of her mouth....I almost stopped...to bum a cigarette... off a homeless person..how damn sad is that.....SAD. I can't smoke I am tired of it but my will power is dying. HELP!!??!!

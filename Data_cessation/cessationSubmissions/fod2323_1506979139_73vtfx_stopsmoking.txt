I know I should...

Hi, I got sent to hospital with pneumonia so couldn't smoke for a couple of days..thought it would be sensible to try to continue,(mainly just so they would let me out). 
I know there are many reasons to quit...but I do miss it,(and the other stuff). 
35 years, give or take 2 years 20 odd years ago that I really didn't enjoy.
sorry for rabbiting on 3 weeks today.

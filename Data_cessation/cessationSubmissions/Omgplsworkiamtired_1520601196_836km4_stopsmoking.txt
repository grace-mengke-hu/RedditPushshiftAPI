Still going!

I started the flip flop thing with going two weeks with out smoking in December. Got strep and a bad ear and respiratory illness in January. Still smoked. Went two more weeks with out them... bought a pack...and got strep, ear, and respiratory illness that took me to an urgent care with 103plus fever. 

Planned brain surgery to remove benign brain tumor and I haven’t smoked in three weeks now! (2 weeks before surgery and one week post) 

I am mobile and doing ok but it finally happened. Instead of feeling like I am missing out on cigarettes. I feel glad I am done. I don’t look at them with longing at all anymore either!

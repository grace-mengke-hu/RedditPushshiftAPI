7 days into quit, can't get rid of this sore throat!

Anyone have any issues early in a quit where you have a lump in your throat constantly?  Thought it was because of the sunflower seeds I was eating and the salt maybe was the issue, but it's not.  Just very frustrating, it's been about 4 days with it.

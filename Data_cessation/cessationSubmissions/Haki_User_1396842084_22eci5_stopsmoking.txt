If you have a toothache, break your arm!

When I was young I used to watch this little cartoon animation on an Arabic cartoon channel. It was about this guy who used to smoke in the past and quit. He had a family of 2 children and a wife. 
So one day, he runs into some sort of financial problem, which caused him to worry a lot, so he starts smoking again. The kids who had seen him smoking and knew of his problem came to him. The first one was screaming and crying, he asked her "what's wrong?" She said:   
"I have a terrible toothache and I told my brother that there is absolutely nothing worse than tooth pain and that I'd rather deal with any other pain, so he broke my arm!"
The dad lifts his hand and is about to hit his boy when the girl shouts: "STOP DAD!" and continues: "my brother did not break my arm or anything"   
Then he looks at her fiercely and asks her to explain or else he will be very angry at their unfunny joke.
She says:   
"My brother and I noticed that you started smoking again because of a problem you have. And we wanted to show you that, you don't fix a problem by creating another one! It's true I have toothache but breaking my arm wouldn't fix it, it will only make me have to deal with two problems instead of one! 
The dad then hugs his children and thank them for the lesson they taught him and promise them to throw his cigarettes away and never to return to them again.  
TL;DR:  
Problem = Problem.  
Problem + Smoking != Solution.  
Problem + Smoking = 2 Problems.    
and dealing with one problem is always much easier than dealing with two.

This sucks

I've been here a handful of times, 21 days is my longest before lighting one up or hitting a vape again. I heard that people try to quit 30 times. Ugh. I'm not sure what number I'm on, but just posting because I want to smoke cigarettes every second of every day, but instead I'm gonna sit here and vent to you all with tears in my eyes as I avoid the temptation. 3 days clean. I hope to make it longer than 21 days.

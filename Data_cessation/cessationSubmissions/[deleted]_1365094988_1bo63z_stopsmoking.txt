I am tired of this feeling half-hearted.

I've been posting here on and off for months. Failing constanty.

My will power always cracks.

I work in an environment where most of the little social interaction I get comes from smoking cigarettes on the balcony.

Right now I'm feeling low, but not low enough. Angry, but not angry enough. I wish I could just go back to when I was meditating and exercising again. It was all so much simpler then, and it was like it wasn't any problem to quit at all. Just snap my fingers and done. Now I'm hooked again and don't have any cigarettes, but I'm feeling half-heartedly like I want to quit.

Help.

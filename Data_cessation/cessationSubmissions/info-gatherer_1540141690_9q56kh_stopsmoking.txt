6 Months free, started dating a smoker

I mean, I’m not _really_ worried about it. I went 6 months free and I can go more, I won’t be triggered by this new experience. I just want to share in case other people are familiar with the situation and can give me their thoughts and advice + eventually for general conversation about this subject.
Thanks

Really easy to quit buying, but I smoke 1-2, once or twice a week, when my cousin comes by.

My cousin and I hang every Saturday and sometimes on a week day as well. He is honestly a great guy and never offers. I ask him as he's a regular smoker. We play retro games, joke, laugh, etc...

It's actually harder to stop this than it was to quit my 3 packs a week personal habit. Any research as to how bad this can be? I need motivation to stop, and my lungs feel fine when I jog and hike.

An unexpected High Five to myself!

This week was an open enrollment period for my company's health care insurance, and I had to do the yearly fill-in-the-blanks forms for the insurance company. I breezed through the form like I always do since my situation really hasn't changed in a long time, that is until I got to the question about tobacco use. With a great deal of pride I was able to answer "No, I have not used any tobacco products in the last 12 months."

I didn't expect to feel so good answering a simple question, but words can't describe. Kind of a big 'Up yours!' to the insurance company as well.....

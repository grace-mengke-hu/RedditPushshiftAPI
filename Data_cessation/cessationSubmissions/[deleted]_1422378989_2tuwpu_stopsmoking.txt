The Problem, Struggle and Solution are all within yourself. Stop externalising what is a part of you and start taking responsibility for it. You'll quit smoking instantly.

I quit smoking a month ago and It happened as if I just came out of a coma. It was instantaneous, painless and devoid of any lengthy thought processes. The one thing which I learned from this experience is that it is all you. The problem is you, the struggle is with you and the solution is you. There are no third party involved, there are no demons (smoking, nicotine, addiction etc), there are no triggers and there are no tips, miracle solution, additional information which can help you quit. It is all you.

You choose to smoke. You alone can choose to not to do it. It is just a decision. Smoking is not a problem, it is your decision. Quitting is not a struggle, it is also a decision. You decide and you do. It is as simple as that. If you need information or guidance or motivation or any kind of external help to do something you have decided, then the whole point of the decision is defeated. If the problem is within you, then naturally the solution is within you. Just decide and do it.

The next time you think smoking is ruining you, remember you are ruining yourself. Next time you search for a reason not to smoke, tell yourself that the only reason not smoke is that you have decided so. The next time you are buying a product (book,patch,gum etc) to help you quit, remember that you cannot buy your decisions. It is always just you and no one else and nothing else.

If you want to quit, forget everything you learned about quitting, forget advantages of quitting, forget all the motivational information you have gathered about quitting, forget every person ever asked you to quit, forget everything except that **"You decided to quit"**. That is all that matters. Everything else is irrelevant.

TL;DR Just decide and do it.

Day One

So here I am on day one, quitting for mostly financial and health reasons. Here are my struggles, anyone have any avoidance techniques?

1. I'm a chef, 9 out of my 12 close co-workers smoke, a lot. How did you best avoid this trigger?

2. I take adderall every now and then. I weened myself off of those too, but sometimes I really need that kick in the ass. Those things make me chug cigs.

3. I smoke when I drive, more habitually than anywhere, what can I do while driving to ease my mind?

So I wanted to quit all summer, but the heavier adderall use, stress from the busy season and driving with the window open are all huge barriers, so I chose the dark cold dead of winter, it should help.

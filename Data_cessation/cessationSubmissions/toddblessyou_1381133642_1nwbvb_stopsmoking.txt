One Month Today!!

I simply can't believe it.  I have tried and tried to quit for years now and, at most, would MAYBE make it two weeks before caving.  I feel younger than I have in so long now.  This subreddit has been absolutely incredible and I attribute so much of this successful quit to the motivation and support that I get from you guys on here.  Thank you.  Now, bring on the next milestone.

It’s been 5 hours and I’m already going insane

I’m at work at my desk and I can’t focus, I keep getting up and sitting down, I feel anxious. I decided to quit this morning, I’m a regular juul user and occasionally cigarettes and I think I made this even harder for myself because I’m used to taking hits off the juul indoors quite frequently. I quit smoking cigarettes before and this is harder than just cigarettes were.

Does anyone have any tips that can help me to tackle day 1? I really don’t want to cave

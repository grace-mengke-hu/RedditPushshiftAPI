Quitting for the millionth time. Hopefully the last.

Hey everyone. Ive had a year of repeating failed quit attempts. It has been absolutely draining. I managed to get a week off work, for other reasons, but I am going to use this time to give the quit another hard shot. I am trying to decide on trying Kratom to help withdrawals, maybe use Mucuna Pruriens, or start the prescription of Wellbutrin I have. Anyways, Day one starts now.

I hate smoking, and yet...

I'm so frustrated with smoking. I hate the way it smells, I hate how much it costs. I'm pissed at myself for letting something control me this much. I hate my need, I hate my cravings. I hate how it makes my husband feel every time I light up. I hate how I can "quit", yet in a moment of weakness I unravel all my hard work by giving in to the nicotine. It makes me a different person than I want to be. Once when I was quitting a craving hit me so hard and deep in my chest that I stole cigarettes off a guy passed out at the pool. Ya, super pathetic.
But most importantly I love the first cigarette of the morning, the cool calming smoke after a meal. The one you indulge in at a bar that leads to meeting new people. I love the smoke dancing over my head in the street lights. I love smoking.
It is time for me to end this for good. I know everyone asks for advice, but I need something real, not feel good "you can do it" bullshit. I need a hard and dirty truth to remind myself how to kick this addiction.

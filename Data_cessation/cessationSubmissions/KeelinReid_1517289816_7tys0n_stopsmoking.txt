Hopefully for Good...

I'm very new to this subreddit and I know it's a good idea to seek a support system for this kind of thing, so here I am! 

I need to quit smoking for an activity I am trying out for this summer, I'm auditioning to be a lead trumpet with a drum and bugle corps. I was a very good trumpet player in my past and I still am, but I cannot risk having my skill deteriorate by having a (literally cancerous) habit. I also used to run and that's not nearly as fun for me as it used to be since I started smoking.

This is the final time I am going to quit smoking.

EDIT: hope wont get me to quit, a strong and firm will to succeed will.
Thanks u/jdclaborn1018 for the helpful comment

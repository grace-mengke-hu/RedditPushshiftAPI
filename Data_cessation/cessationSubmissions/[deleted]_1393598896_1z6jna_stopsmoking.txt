High Blood Pressure After Quitting?

Hi all - 

So I'm on day 24, and I really don't see myself looking back.  It's going great and I quite frankly just don't feel like dealing with the past three weeks ever again when it comes to cravings, withdrawls, anxiety, etc. 

One thing that I have noticed recently is my blood pressure.  It's been high, floating anywhere between 130-150 over 80-90.  I've been trying very hard to exercise and do at least twenty minutes of cardio a day to get the blood flowing, as well as watching my sodium intake, etc.

I know I need to consult a doctor, which is already in the works.  I'm maintaining a journal of my BP to take to him when I go see him in two weeks.  But in the mean time, has anyone else experienced this?  I'm young (only 25) and I know that quitting is the best thing for me, and I am so proud and happy of my decision to stop smoking.  I just really don't want to be a 25 year old on freakin BP meds.

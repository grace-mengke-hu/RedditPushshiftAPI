Day one done.

I am now 1 day 12 hours in. I really didn’t think I’d make it. So so sad. I got home from work last night and all I wanted to do was make a decaf and smoke cigs on my back porch. I feel accomplished and I felt awesome waking up this morning. Pushing away one craving at a time. 

My main reasons for quitting:
To gain back healthy weight and muscle. 
To be the true athlete I am. 
To smell better.
To get rid of the anxiety and lack of energy brought on by smoking. 

Not a lot of people know I smoke. And no one except this community knows I’m quitting. I put a note on my fridge that says “watch me.”  I’m quitting for ME.

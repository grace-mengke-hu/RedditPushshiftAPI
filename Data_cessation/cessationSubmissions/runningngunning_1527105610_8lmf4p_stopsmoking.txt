Five days in, first time posting here

Five days into my third real attempt at quitting after having smoked for eight years. The day I quit was the day I moved across the country for work. The packing and moving process has kept me distracted so far in but I’m worried what happens when I’m all settled in - I don’t know about a lot of you but I find myself more tempted to smoke when I’m bored/have down time as opposed to when I’m stressed. 


At any rate, signing up for a few classes and looking into some hobbies I’ve always wanted to pursue. Wish me luck! Excited to hit 100 days with you guys.

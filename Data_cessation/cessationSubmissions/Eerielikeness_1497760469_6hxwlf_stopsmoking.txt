First Post - 72 Days

Hi everyone, nearly two and half months smoke free but the past week was a tough one. Thought I would renew my resolve by offering support to anyone who is just starting out. 

I smoked for thirteen years before this quit - a pack a day for most of it. I couldn't go to sleep or wake up without them, so if I can get through the worst of it - so can you. 

I used Chantix (Varenicline) for the first six weeks and then went on my own. I didn't have any of the side effects that people worry about, just some gastrointestinal problems. I also used a vaporizer with 0mg liquid to satisfy the physical urge for the action of smoking.  Feel free to ask me anything about any of this.

I remember the first few weeks and how impossible it all seems, but it does get easier.

How did you quit

My bf has been "quitting" for 8 months.
No progress.  We got him an e cig, he barely touched it.

He says its an oral fixation. He wont chew gum because he doesn't like it. He refuses to go cold turkey.  What can he do? He promised me and his dad he would quit. 8 months ago. 

I have asthma bad and he smokes in our small bedroom. I sneeze alot and have trouble breathing through my nose. He does turn on the hepa fan when he smokes and it helps a little. I'm just really sensitive to the camel crush bolds. The Marlboro nxts don't bug me but he said he didn't like them  because there isn't enough nicotine or menthol in them. 


Also he told me in the winter he wouldn't smoke in my jeep but he did anyway. Windows down cooold ride. How do I get him to quit smoking in my car.


He said he wants to quit but hasn't shown enthusiasm, his smoking doesn't bother me unless hes in a small area with me such as our bedroom or the jeep.


Any suggestions are appreciated.  Is it normal to want to quit but be more talk and less action.

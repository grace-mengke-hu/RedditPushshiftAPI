Three thoughts after five days...

1. Any Lost fans here? I keep thinking of the episode "Dave" from season two. Hurley is in a mental institution with the bald guy (Evan Handler), who keeps trying to get him to eat, and then the big twist at the end. I keep picturing my nicotine monster as that guy, and whenever the cravings hit, I calmly explain to him that he's not real and needs to STFU.

2. I used nicotine gum the first two days. Big mistake. Just prolonged the whole process, and it did not really help that much in the moment. No NRT. It's just another crutch.

3. God damn green tea has been a life saver. Maybe its all psychosomatic, but its cleansing properties, little bit of caffeine, I swear its helped a ton. I've put down a couple liters a day. And it has to be the real stuff, actual leaves, not sugar water tea from the gas station.

Old smoking ''buddies''

Hey non-smokers! Here is something I need to vent. At work I have a colleague who is being a real *******... We used to smoke together in the breaks, talk a lot and I even invited this person over to my home for a BBQ. Now, this person can do nothing than make not so nice comments. No congratulations, no what a good job, just being unsupportive. I hated people who quite and could talk about nothing than that, so I did not do that. I just tried to do the small-talk; ''are you going to do something nice this weekend?'' or the simple ''How are you?'' .At the latter I got a reply yesterday as follows: ,,I still smoke''. I was/am really annoyed by this. I don't understand why somebody who still smokes is giving me these stupid answers/remarks. According to an article I read, apparently 30% of smokers are showing this unsupportive behavior, due to jealousy or maybe they miss there smoking buddies. 
The statistic is fine, but how to deal with this. It seems like there is no winning in this situation. Being nice or being unkind, somehow it is my fault this ''friendship'' is over. As a solution I will ignore this person now, but it is hard. I don't want to be unkind, but yeah... Hope you guys can follow me a bit... Like to hear your thoughts about this!

Last night I realized that listening to music is a huge trigger for me, yikes.

For whatever reason I hadn't listened to any music since before I quit (too busy, etc.). Last night I couldn't sleep so I loaded a playlist on my laptop and immediately felt like I wanted to smoke.
Well not so much that I wanted to, but like I SHOULD. Like it just felt right to have a cig in my hand and be puffing away while I listened to music. I though back over the years (decades) and it's true, I used to always smoke while I listened to music.


I didn't turn the music off. I let the trigger happen and just finished my playlist. I thought about the moment Alan Carr describes near the end of the book, when you're doing something that you always used to smoke while doing, something that can't even imagine doing without a smoke. And when the day comes that you're doing that activity and don't even think about smoking at all, that's the day you are ~~truly freeee or something like that.
So I guess I figured out what my penultimate thingy is. I'm not going to stop listening to music. But I wonder how long it will take for my brain to stop thinking "Why is there no cigarette in my hand" anytime I hear music!

How long did the Shortness of Breath last for you?

I am experiencing shortness of breath (not too severe but it feels like I need to be taking deeper breaths). I also have a cough that has become annoying now (started a day or so ago). 

I have an appointment scheduled for next month but in the meantime I would like some info to set my mind at ease

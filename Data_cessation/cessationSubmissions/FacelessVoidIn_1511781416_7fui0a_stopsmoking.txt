Starting my journey.

Basically, i've been a smoker for 3 years. Was trying to quit few times in the past and managed to get to 2 months max. Also after that i started smoking really heavily like pack a day, sometimes even more. Lately i've been hating myself for having this addiction it's hurting my finances, my mental and physical health i just hate myself so much because of this. So today at 6pm i'm gonna smoke my last cig and say bb ma fella.

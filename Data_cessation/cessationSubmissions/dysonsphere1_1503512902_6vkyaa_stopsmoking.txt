It gets easier!

I stopped smoking 25 days ago. This morning my car would not start and I was late for work. I didn't think about smoking once. When I got to work, a coworker tried to "help" by offering me a cigarette to ease the stress. I said no thanks. I think I'm finally to the point where smoking was something that I used to do. If I can do it, anyone can. Believe me! Just stopping by to let you guys know, don't give up! Each day it gets easier.

I'm done.

Simple as that. Had my longest smokefree streak last year after ~15 years of pack a day smoking. Felt absolutely amazing. Relapsed in the Fall, everything came back quick and struggled with it until now. Couple attempts since then but nothing significant. I feel like it's clicked tonight. I can't keep walking down that path any longer. Excited for the freedom- to no longer have massive migraines- to no longer waste money all to destroy myself and feel awful- to sleep better and feel more alive once again as my body heals, no more anxiety and panic attacks. Wishing everyone the best who is shedding this addiction. No doubt each and every one of us can do it. 

I'll be posting periodicially to update. This community helped me so much the first time and I'm looking forward to dropping these silly chains once again, this time forever.

Thank you r/stopsmoking:)

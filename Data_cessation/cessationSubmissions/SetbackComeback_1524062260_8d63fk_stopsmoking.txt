2 Hours Into My Day

For all struggling to quit, and newly minted quitters -- I come bearing a bit of good news.

Today, it took 2 hours after waking up for me to even think of smoking. That was unimaginable weeks ago, no less even a few days ago.

Celebrating this little win with all of you today, and telling you that yes, it does in fact, get easier.

Thanks for all -- and cheers to a new day ahead.

How much do you beat yourself up if you slip up?

Hello, non-smoker for 11 days, 23 hours, 3 minutes and 9 seconds here...well, I say that, last night I got very drunk with my three friends who all smoke like chimneys and what can I say? I cracked and had one. Or two.

On one hand, I've been so angry at myself today. So angry. But then my workmate pointed out, as I used to smoke ten a day, maybe the occasional one with a drink isn't so bad.

OR IS IT?

Long-term quitters: do you ever have an occasional slip, or are occasional slips just a slippery slope back into smoking?

Recent quitters: What would you do if you were me? Set the app timer back and start over, or keep on as you were and think of it as a blip?

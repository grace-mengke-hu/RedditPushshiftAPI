It's day four and I CAN SMELL EVERYTHING!

Tonight I was around some smokers for the first time since my last cigarette four days ago. We were outside and there were two people smoking about 15 feet from me with the gusty wind carrying the smoke away pretty quickly, and still, I knew as soon as someone lit up. It was not a good smell. In fact, it burned my nose a little. It was kind of nauseating. When I got home I walked past a window ledge near my back door and noticed a rancid smell. I have always kept a cup or a can or something on that ledge for dropping butts into and I haven't thrown it away yet. I've walked past it a million times and never smelled it until tonight. I could also smell a garbage can near my back patio where there are cigarette butts. When I put my son to bed I could smell his freshly washed hair. I told him it smelled good and he smelled me and said, "Mom you don't smell like anything now!"  Pretty awesome stuff. I'm recovering from a bad cold (part of the reason I timed my quit when I did) and if I can smell this much better even with my cold, I can only imagine what it's going to be like when I'm completely over it. I also noticed my sense of taste was more intense today, but not as much as smells yet. Or maybe I just haven't eaten anything good yet.

First attempt...no casualties....

I've decided to quit smoking. I've made it three days and almost 15 hours. I won't lie, I loved almost every cigarette I've ever smoked. This hasn't been the worst thing in my life (yet?) so I'm going to keep it up. Thinking that I should have bought a punching bag though...I've never realized my "dark side" could be so dark until I couldn't tame it down with a smoke! Cheers to all of us QUITTERS!

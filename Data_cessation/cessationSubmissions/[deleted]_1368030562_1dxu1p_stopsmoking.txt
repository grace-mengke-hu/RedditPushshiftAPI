Haven't stopped smoking but made progress.

My wife has been a daily smoker since we got married 5 years ago. I hate the smoke, the nasty pile of ash , the smell of her hair. Everything about smoking I hate. Seeing people walk like chimneys. Seeing how Society isolates smokers now. You can kind of understand the sort of relief I felt when my wife discovered electronic cigarettes. A new shop just opened several weeks ago in my town. 

Now I will be the first ones to say that cold turkey helped me stop drinking. I think that is one of the best ways to stop a habit. Unfortunately for my wife that doesn't seem to be the case with smoking. I really do feel for her because I see her struggle. and although she still consumes nicotine with e-cigarettes at least I don't have to smell the nasty smoke, have all that nasty ash and nasty cigarettes. 

I would rather have an e-cig any day then a regular cigarette. It feels like we live in an all or nothing kind of society. And I don't want to impose that on my wife. At least I have gotten rid of the smell, the piles of ash, and the endless cartons. I would say that's an improvement. I am happy with the improvements I see for now. It seems like now days everyone needs to have their "fix" in order to feel good. I feel good that I don't have to see my wife suffer cold turkey. 

I feel that we need to understand that maybe some people can't quit cold turkey and that doesn't mean the are total failures. I would take something then nothing any day. and not having the smell, the endless smoke breaks, tons of ash, cartons is a huge improvement in my opinion. My wife understands that nicotine is still a concern and we disagree the way this e-cigs are being marketed. I can only say that in my family I feel that it has helped us alot. Everywhere you see people that need their "fix". coffee, alcohol, pot, etc. At least it's an improvement in my opinion what do you think?

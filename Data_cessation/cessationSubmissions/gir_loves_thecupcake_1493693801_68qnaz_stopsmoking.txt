I did it! One year!

We'll, I've been waiting for this since day one. The day that I felt I would officially become a non-smoker. I had been wanting to quit for so long and one day my best friend (in another state) announced that she had quietly quit and had been smoke free for a whole year. I thought to myself "if she can do it, so can I". I set my quit date and was on my way. The beginning was crazy hard. I had the most ridiculous thoughts, wondering if I would ever be cool or interesting again because smoking had become my identity. In hindsight, that seems so silly but reading posts on this sub, I know I wasn't the only one who felt that way. So those of you experiencing those feelings now, I promise they will pass. All of the shitty feelings that come with quitting will pass. Just hang in there. I thought today would be the day I truly was a non-smoker. It's a huge milestone that I'm very proud of, but the truth is, I've felt like a non-smoker for months now, and it feels amazing. I never thought I could do this. Now it's hard to see how I ever doubted myself. Hang in there guys, it does get easier, I promise.

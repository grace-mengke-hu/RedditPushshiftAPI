It's much easier than I thought

The mere thought of not smoking made me worry, what about mood swings, cravings, withdrawal? I thought it would be the hardest thing I would ever try to do. 

So, when I decided to go cold turkey instead of gradually reducing the amount I smoked seemed like a crazy idea that I would regret instantly. 

The hardest thing I found was being friends with people who smoke, especially at work. At work I would normally go out for a cigarette to socialise with other people from other departments (I work in a hotel) that I wouldn't normally get to talk to.
People kept asking me to go out for a cigarette which I found difficult but I politely declined and told them I'd quit smoking. 

I don't really have any cravings, my mood swings are minimal at most. I found that once I set my mind to quitting that I haven't thought about it as much as thought. 

My motivation: knowing that my friends, my boyfriend and my family will be proud of me. As well as making myself proud for actually sticking it out. 

I'm a non smoker

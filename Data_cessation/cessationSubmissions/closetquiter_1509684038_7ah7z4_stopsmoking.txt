Closet Smoker quitting

I have smoked for 18 years and no one in my family knows I smoke including my wife.  I mean my wife knows I used to smoke when I went out to the bars, and some friends know, mainly my boys. Anyways. I quit smoking 9/25/17. For one reason, my 3 kids. I went in and kissed them goodnight and realized if I kept this up I was hurting them more than myself.  Went out the next day and bought a vape, smoked my last one on the night of the 25th and haven’t had one since.  I have no one to celebrate milestones like a month without a cig with as I can’t tell my family. Figured going online to reddit where I have lurked for years to share my success.  Any suggestions on vape nicotine amounts and a slow decrease in amounts to eventually quit all together?  Also, anyone have dreams about smoking and having a cig in your dream and then being mad you did?  Has happened more than once and have had other weird dreams. Anyways, have only read a few posts in this sub, but wanted to share my successes so far.  To everyone else here keep it up and I look forward to celebrating future successes.

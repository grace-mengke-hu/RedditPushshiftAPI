Quitting smoking for the 1,000th time / introducing myself to this subreddit, nice to meet you all!

Hey all, just wanted to introduce myself to this subreddit. I have quit smoking many times, literally at least a thousand times (okay maybe not a thousand but definitely a few hundred...), but I seem to be getting better and better at it.

Three "quits" ago, I went for about fifty days before I caved. I had smoked some mary jane, and on the way to the bar I felt very nervous and full of anxiety. Even though I hadn't smoked in fifty days, I felt like smoking cigarettes would help me calm down. It only made it worse, and my lungs felt like crap the next morning, so I quit again. I smoked a whole pack that night at the bar, feeling terrible.

The next "quit" was my most recent, longest stretch, and that was for around fifty-eight, possibly over sixty days. I messed up on the 18th of last month, after drinking WAY too much, and then smoking some mary jane again. I kinda figured out that when I smoke MJ, cigarettes are very soon to follow. 

That night I only had two cigarettes, but everyone on here said I should reset my quit date anyways, and honestly, I agree. I just wasn't as proud of my number of days clean from smoking cigarettes as I was before, and I think it's because I knew I had technically broken the rules by having just one puff.

So my new quitting date is 12/19/2012! I am happy to meet you all, and look forward to breaking my record of sixty days again. I truly, TRULY, hate smoking, with a passion, I know I can abstain as long as I just don't give in to... other substances. Nice to meet you all, and any advice is greatly welcome! :)

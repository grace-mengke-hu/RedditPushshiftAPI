How disgusting this actually is

I've been smoking for 5 years. About 15-20 cigs a day.
One day, somewhere in public, I've seen a random person smoking, just as it happens several times a day.

There was nothing special about this person, just a random smoker.
However, while I was watching at this person, I felt a massive revulsion at that scene.

At this very moment, thinking about a cig was that disgusting, that I wanted to barf. I put my open package with 15 cigs left in the trash.

That's been 9 months ago.

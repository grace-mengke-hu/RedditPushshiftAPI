Tips for dealing with mouth ulcers

When I was young I suffered from mouth ulcers quite badly whenever I lacked sleep or my immune system was down. For the past three years I haven't really had any but since I quit smoking 10 days ago (Whoo!) I've had a sudden resurgence and they're not only keeping me from talking and eating but they're also pretty excruciating and are keeping my mood down.

I read somewhere that ulcers are a common side-effect of quitting, so has anyone here been through the same and have any advice on how to cope with these and not let them keep me down?

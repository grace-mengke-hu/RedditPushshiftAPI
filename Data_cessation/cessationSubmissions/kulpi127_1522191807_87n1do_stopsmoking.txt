Want to quit but SO still smokes

Hi all.  So I’ve been smoking since I was 17.  It’s become a massive part of my life.  All my friends smoke, my girlfriend smokes, I’m surrounded by it.  I’ve tried to quit a few times, but to no avail.  I’ve been toying with the idea of quitting, but the lady isn’t quite ready.  So my question, how can I quit if my girlfriend still smokes?  Has anyone had a similar experience?  I’m afraid that if I am around her when she’s smoking it will make me crave a cigarette even more.

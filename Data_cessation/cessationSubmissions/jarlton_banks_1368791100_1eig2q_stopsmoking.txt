Everyone keeps offering me smokes

Every day at work I get offered smokes from my coworkers and it is so hard to say no. I feel like as long as I don't buy smokes and I just bum 1-2 per day I can wean myself off but now I feel like it is even harder to quit. I go a day or two without any and then I give in and I keep starting over from scratch. I just feel so weak because I can't cut out even this small amount. Has anyone else gotten stuck at this point? I need some encouragement.

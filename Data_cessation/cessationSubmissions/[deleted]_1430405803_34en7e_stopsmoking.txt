Something small that helped me quit

This worked for me, and I know it won't work for most.  But maybe there are some out there like me who could use my story for quitting.

When I was 14, I started dipping.  I played Varsity baseball as a freshman and was heavily influenced in to it by the seniors who dipped. Every time I had practice? Dip. After food? Dip. Drive to and from school? Dip.  I had my routine and dipped every day.

When I got to college, I picked up smoking. Walking to/from class? Smoke a cig. Morning after my breakfast? Smoke a cig. Night after dinner? Smoke a cig.  I had my routine and smoked every day. (While still dipping).

I thought for the longest time I had a pretty bad tobacco and nicotine addiction.  I tried patches, gum, and a whole bunch.  It took me a while, but I finally realized something after I went on vacation for a week with no nicotine.


I wasn't addicted to tobacco.  I was addicted to my routine.  When I started working, I knew the drive to work, 9:30, 12:00, 2:30, and the drive home from work was my time to smoke.  When I got home, I never really craved stepping outside for a smoke. If my day changed and I took off work, I could go all day without smoking or craving a cig.  It was my routine I was addicted too.  

It started slow, replacing my routine with other things such as sunflower seeds or other small finger snacks.  I started replacing breaks with more work to keep my mind off smoking.  I picked up an e-cig for those times where I wanted to smoke, as I knew it was the act of smoking and my routine I was addicted to.

Over time, I completely switched my routine.  I no longer have dedicated smoking times throughout the day, so I don't have the urge to smoke. I still dip though, and that's something I'm working on quitting right now as well.  

If you are the rare case like me who doesn't really have cravings, try breaking your routine.

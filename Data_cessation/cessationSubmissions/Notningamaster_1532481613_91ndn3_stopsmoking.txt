I've set a quit date now what?

I set a quit date of the 26th, I am both a drug addict and a serious problem drinker.

Legal problems and other issues lead to me quitting drinking on the 11th. Through my counselor and assements my biggest trigger for drinking is smoking.

I've decided if I am going to live a clean lifestyle I should be completely clean. However, the thought of going completely substance free scares the hell out of me.

How do I even start? Has any other alcoholic out there quit for the same reasons, how did you start? I can't smoke or I will invetibly drink, one always followed the other. It's time to regain my life and mind back fully, it's time to be completely sober. 

The 26th and I am going to go cold turkey.

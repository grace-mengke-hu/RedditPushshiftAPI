My 3rd try

Well my first two times were a faliure one after 1 month second after only few days. I decided to try to stop again. Honestly I am compleetly miserable. Since I found out I have a very high rate of getting a melanome because of my skin color. I decided I can stop while it is still not too late to lower my lung cancer rate.

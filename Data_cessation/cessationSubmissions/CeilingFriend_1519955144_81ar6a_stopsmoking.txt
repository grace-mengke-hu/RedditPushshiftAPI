There are a lot of reasons but here are a few reasons I love being a non-smoker.

Not having to constantly stop at the gas station for cigs.

Hardly thinking about smoking. Or quitting. It’s all so normal it’s not my focus anymore.

Seeing how many cigarettes I haven’t smoked. It’s crazy to think about all those hundreds of smokes that would have gone in my body if I hadn’t quit.

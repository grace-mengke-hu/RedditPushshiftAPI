This just isn't me anymore.

I don't want cigs.

I'm drunk and I can't stand them. I know I can't stand them but my body and mind craves them, and I know how bad it is. How awful for me they are.

This is the beginning of my reconditioning. 

They make me feel awful.

I know without them that my libido is better, my wallet looks fatter, I smell better, feel better, wake up with energy, desire to exercise . . . Every single possible thing about my life is better without them.

So why the fuck does my brain think they make me feel good?

At some point or another, your intellect has to take over. You have to decide that you want to be better than that.

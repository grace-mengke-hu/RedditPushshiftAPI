Trying to get back to normal

Hey everybody, I'm new here and the past week has been very sluggish and frustrating for me.

A little background: I smoked between a fourth and a half a pack a day for the past decade or so, and occasionally before then. Usually, smoking was an evening activity, but in the last couple years, I became a morning smoker with my cup of coffee. Interestingly enough, no coffee meant no cigarette. So I decided this past Monday to drop both the caffeine and the cigarettes at the same time since I didn't want the association to make cravings even worse.

Anyway, I have been napping every day, and having spotty sleep at night. I'm groggy in the mornings (which used to be my favourite part of the day) and have been overall less productive. I'm not craving nicotine physically, but I do want to tie off the end of my day with a cigarette and feel like that closure is missing and could be contributing to my general "blah" feeling.

I'm kind of rambling at this point, but I feel like I could handle the nicotine cravings if I were just productive. But instead, I don't have any real cravings to speak of, but I just can't bring myself to give a shit about anything. My wife says that it's all in my head. I'd like to know from you guys if what I'm experiencing is similar to what you have gone through.

Thanks for reading!

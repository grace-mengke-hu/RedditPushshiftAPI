Just some random thoughts after being a non-smoker for a few months

I've smoked for about 9 years, about half a pack or a full pack per day while also smoking weed mixed with tobacco almost every day. Quit for maybe 6 months in total in between. This time I'm totally done and after a month of struggling in the beginning, I'm feeling great a couple of months in. Always been really skinny and eating a bit unhealthy, but now I'm just munching down healthy food like there's no tomorrow, gaining weight and feeling much better about life. It's such an amazing ride and I'm thankful asf to witness all of it. It's one of the major reasons that helps me stay a non-smoker. Why would I risk losing this life over some cancer sticks?

Physically I feel great too, but the nagging thought of dying is still fucking with me. I want to grow old, get kids, see my grandchildren being born and live until I'm at least 75. Dear universe, forgive me for being so ungrateful with the only life I will ever have and please let me experience that. I'm 27 now so I hope this epiphany came on time.

One week had been remarkably simple, but I'm worried about cravings rearing their heads.

So I made it to seven days today! I feel really great about the milestone, but I'm worried that it's only because I have been distracted during this time. I injured my ankle pretty badly, and I'm in the run-around trying to get a full diagnosis and even start treatment so I'm hobbling around on crutches and occasionally taking narcotic pain meds (I avoid taking them in favor of ibuprofen except in severe pain. Family member had an addiction plus I'm just not super compatible as far as side-effects) and going outside for a smoke is just at the extreme back of my mind.

  I guess my apprehensiveness is just that once I am clear of the injury and more mobile that cravings will return more forcefully. Thanks for letting me vent, guys!

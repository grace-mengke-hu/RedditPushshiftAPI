I had to reset my badge...

So, I still haven't made it past day one and I'm feeling pretty shitty. I was doing so well and feeling so great with not smoking for most of my day. I have decided to try not smoking tomorrow, even after having multiple quit dates in a row (today would mark my fourth day). I guess I'm just posting this to vent and rant about how bad I feel. I have let myself down and I feel that I have let my daughter down. Tomorrow is a new day, and I'm excited to wake up to a new quit day. However, I am also nervous that I will give in. I don't want to smoke as I know I'm stronger than my addiction! At the same time, I am loosing a bit of self-confidence as I am tired of feeling trapped by cigarettes. The anxiety I have developed about the negative consequences of smoking is almost unbearable - especially at night before I go to bed. All I can think about is that I killed myself a little bit today. Not exactly the thoughts I would like before going to sleep... I will start reading Allen Carr's book tonight, and I really hope it helps. Wish me luck tomorrow!

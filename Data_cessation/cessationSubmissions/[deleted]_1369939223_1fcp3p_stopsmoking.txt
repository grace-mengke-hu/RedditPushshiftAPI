Day 4... I can't do this. The cravings are too strong.

Looking at my title I know I'm being stupid. I can totally do this. But I don't want to. I don't see why I should have to. I just want one right now. I know it won't help, it won't make anything better. But I just want one. I can't imagine myself never smoking again. I'm going out drinking tonight for the first time since I "quit". No one that's going is a smoker so it won't be that bad, but I can't see myself going to bed tonight without having had a smoke at some point.

I just don't believe in myself. I really really don't.

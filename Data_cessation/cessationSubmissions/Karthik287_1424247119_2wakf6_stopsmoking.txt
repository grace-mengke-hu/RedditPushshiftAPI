Day 3

The first 2days nicotine pangs were only in the evening after dinner and they'd hit me about 4-5 times within a two hour time frame of 8:30pm-10:30pm. Today it hasn't been like that. I've been craving a cigarette ever since I woke up & to be honest i'm worried that I might light up again. I also know that after smoking for a week or so I'll start hating it again. This is just so confusing. I dont know how much longer I can take this.

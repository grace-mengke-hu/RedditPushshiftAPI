I have just beaten my first 100 without smoking and... It's not that difficult!

I've been smoking for 7 years. I decided I had to quit so I had to quit so I smoked my last one 5 days ago. I thought it would be much more difficult but reading all of you going through the same way made it much easier! Thanks guys!

PS. I only get some cravings when I do something I used to do while smoking, but I'm not really missing it, just from time to time!

PS. I'm not english so I may have made some mistakes, sorry!

My brain doesn't work

Oh my god 4 days free after 20 years and 20 a day!! it's like my brain has shut down, disturbed sleep pattern, unable to concentrate for more than 30 seconds, stoppin smoking is turning me into a goldfish!!! It will be all worth it once I get past this crazines. Anyone else experiencing these effects?? X

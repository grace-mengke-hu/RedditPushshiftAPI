Do you stop hanging out with friends who smoke or go to smoker friendly places?

I want to quit. But all my friends smoke and we like to go out to bars on the weekends but my friends only want to go to smoking bars. I enjoy those bars and some of them are my favorites but I know they will be a huge trigger to smoke especially when my friends light up. We do pub trivia every Tuesday at a small smoking bar. It’s always a good time and they serve good food but damn does it get smoky in there. Almost everyone that comes with us smokes, I don’t want to stop going but it’s going to be hard to quit in those environments.

Do you guys just power through it and resist temptation or just stay in when your friends go out? The guy I am currently seeing is my only friend that doesn't smoke, so I want to quit so he won't mind kissing me/being around me, but he goes to college about an hour away and isn't always around to hang out with when my smoker friends go out.

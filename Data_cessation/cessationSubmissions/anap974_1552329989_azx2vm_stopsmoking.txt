My 3 weeks on patches and 14 days without cigaretes

I am so happy. First time after 30 years (1-2 pack) smoking, I am 14 days smoke free. With patches help. For 3 weeks Iâ€™m going on level 2, and I beleive for one and half month Iâ€™ll be complitely nicotine free. Patches are life safer for me. I know that I will have cravings when I stop to use patches. But I learn to live without cigarettes after 30 years. I hope I will survive that cravingsðŸ˜€

Here we go again... nearly 48 hours

I've been struggling for the past two years to quit. The longest I've gone recently is about two months. 

I **absolutely have to** make it work this time. I am almost all the way through the application process to become a volunteer firefighter at a department with a zero-tolerance policy for smoking. Once I sign that contact, hopefully sometime this week, I cannot smoke under any circumstances.

I work graveyards at a drug rehab. It's tough to get through a shift without smoking because there is so much downtime and almost everybody here smokes. I'm about halfway through my first shift since quitting and I'm doing alright. I chewed one piece of nicotine gum on my way to work and I haven't needed any since then. I think I'll make it through the whole shift. 

Anyway, just needed to get that all off my chest. Thanks for reading.

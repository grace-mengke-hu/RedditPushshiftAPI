To quit smoking...

Everyday this week has been supposed to be my last day as a smoker, actually starting last Thursday. I've smoked for 15 years. I quit for a year and a half one time, but silly me screwed that up when I went to Vegas, just had to smoke "socially", came back and voila hooked again... This is extremely challenging. All of my employees smoke, half of my clients smoke. I am surrounded!!!!!!!! Here's to tomorrow! Anxiety is already starting. Grrrrr....

Nearing 10,000 days as a non-smoker!

It was the best decision I've made in my entire life.  I did it complete cold turkey, had smoked between 1 and 2 packs a day for probably 15 years before I gave it up.  I did it through the Seventh Day Adventist's "Five-Day Plan to Quit Smoking".

The cravings never completely went away, they just became less of a burden.  I always remind myself that I am one puff away from being a smoker.  I have dreamed that I started smoking again countless times and I always wake up so pissed at myself.  

I just noticed that they still do the campaign.  If you want to, check their [advice!] (http://sthelena22.adventistchurchconnect.org/article/144/ministries/health-ministries/stop-smoking-in-five-days)

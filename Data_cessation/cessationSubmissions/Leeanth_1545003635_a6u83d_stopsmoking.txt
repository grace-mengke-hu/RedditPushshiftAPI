Day one

Heading back to my hypnotist today. About six years ago I did some sessions with him and immediately quit for two years. Then some stuff happened and I started smoking again, even though I knew that even one was BAD.  


I am not waiting for a cliche New Year quit. My blood pressure was measured a few days ago at an almost dangerous level and I've had a lot of asthma lately. Doing it now...

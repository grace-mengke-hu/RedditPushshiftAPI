Motivation for the men to keep it up, literally.

Didn't mean to make until I finished typing that sentence.  My main motivation for not smoking when I'm struggling is thinking about how it'll negatively affect my sex life.  I'm 25 years old but when I smoked and consequently drank because to quit smoking I had to quit drinking, my sex life wasn't good. If a partner or myself wanted to change position I'd half to do it super quickly. I only had a short window of time that I would stay hard without something stimulating my penis.  This also affected condom use, condoms sick in general but when you suffer from lack of blood flow and have to wear a condom they get that much worse.  Imagine just stopping in the middle of sex cause you're exhausted to the point blood isn't flowing to your penis anymore but to more important areas.  The girl looks up at you and says "did you cum?" It seems pretty obvious to you that you didn't but maybe you can fool her by quickly turning around and tossing the condom in the garbage and say "yeah".  Then you have to put on a fake smile so they think you're happily satisfied but Inside your dying and still wanting to get off. Ironically I don't have a girlfriend or go to bars to prevent relapsing so my sex life is non existant but whenever I'm craving a cigarette I just think about how when I smoked I would rarely be fully hard and putting on condoms was a nightmare.

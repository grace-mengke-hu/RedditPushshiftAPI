Live from day 7! And I don't want to kill people (as often)

I'm working through day seven of no smoking (using patches) and I have already found that my most intense cravings occur less frequently. I was even at a smoky bar last night and found myself more annoyed by how it made my throat hurt than by not being able to smoke one myself.

This is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in years, and I think it's because I found a way to quit that works for me. I've made peace with the fact that going cold turkey is not going to do it for me (I'm not Rambo), so the patches are giving me a chance to build my self-control to a point where I will soon be able to say "No" to nicotine altogether.

Good luck, guys! I hope you all find a way that works for you too. I'm excited!

I really need to stop smoking

I've been smoking cigarettes and using chewing tobacco since I was 16. I've used nicotine to "calm my anxiety" or "give me something to do". I've tried stopping cold turkey, making it anywhere from 8 hours to 6 months without using nicotine but always coming back. I developed scar tissue on my gums and was forced to stop chewing out of fear of developing oral cancer. I had become single and found that women weren't very attracted to the smell of cigarettes on my clothes and skin. So I picked up a juul and I have been smoking this thing nonstop for close to a year. Burning nearly a pod a day, wasting thousands of dollars on this shit. I smoke so much that I hardly eat. I've lost 20 pounds since I started smoking again 2 months ago. I've lost nearly all of the muscle I had put on from eating healthy and working out when I stopped. I feel like shit and I'm so sick of being a slave to this shit. 

It's never been this hard for me to stop doing anything and I need help. I need to be here with you all, making my life better again.

Depressed after quitting

I quit as a part of a New year's resolution (I'm not a resolution person, but it seemed as good as any to quit)... I have had such a hard time with it. I'm 11 days in, using a vape instead (though not much), and I have never been more anxious. I can't really sleep, I'm having trouble concentrating and I've been pretty depressed. Has this been the experience for anyone else? 

Honestly, it's just hard. I've had these tendencies in the past, but this is escalated.  It feels like hell, but I keep thinking, it's this he'll now or a worse one later. Just wanted to share my experience so far. And see how others that have recently started are doing.

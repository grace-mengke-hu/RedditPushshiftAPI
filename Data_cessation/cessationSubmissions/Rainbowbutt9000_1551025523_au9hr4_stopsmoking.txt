1 week but having problems

I quit smoking like a week ago but right now,I'm getting chest pains regularly and I would find it difficult to breathe at times.I've only been smoking for 2 years before I stopped and it's not that frequent at all,I wasn't a heavy smoker. My friends tell me that it's just withdrawal symptoms but I feel like it's something more serious than that. Just asking if some people have gone through this as well. Thanks!

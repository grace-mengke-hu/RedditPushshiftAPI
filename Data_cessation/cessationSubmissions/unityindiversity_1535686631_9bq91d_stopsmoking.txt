Advice on quitting that goes beyond the typical stuff (chew gum, read up on the health effects, etc)?

I've been quitting on and off (not much long-term success this summer) and it's driving me nuts lolol I found the only thing that really 'worked' was drinking a lot of tea, not getting drunk for the entire time I was quitting, and not going for coffee's with my friends. I'd love a suggestion on how to cope with watching people smoke without succumbing to the urge.

Sorry, I imagine this question is posted here a lot. I'm just kinda at a loss here. I really wanna quit but I find it unbelievably hard (surprise surprise lolol) especially when  it comes to social situations where others are smoking.

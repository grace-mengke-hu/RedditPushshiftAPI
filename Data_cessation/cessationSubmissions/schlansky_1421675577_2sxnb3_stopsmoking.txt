Farewell and ta ta

I would like to thank you all! I am going to unsubscribe from this subreddit because I donÂ´t need it anymore! Yes, /stopsmoking is that good!

To those of you who struggle I say this: 194 days ago I could have never imagined how splendid it feels to be a non smoker. It is worth it. It gets easier. Stay strong.

Hey NYE quitter here - cravings long gone! Rejoice.

Praise. However I am coughing up brown phlegm in the mornings. Is this normal? After 5 months of no smoking? I did smoke for 10 years I suppose. I've got a general health check in a week - but I just wanted to see how other people are doing with cravings and coughing up gunk. It's not very satisfying gunk either, I expected more.

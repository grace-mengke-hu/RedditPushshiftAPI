embarking on my day 8th!

This is the 8th day of me not smoking, and I again choose not to moke. Today I do not have mental cravings. The day before yesterday was the worst yesterday was also tough. Today is fine, I feel very calm. Yesterday I also started weaning off of caffeine. Yesterday I herd about people starting to smoke after a number of years not smoking and that freaks me out...eventhough it is nasty at first, they still relapse.

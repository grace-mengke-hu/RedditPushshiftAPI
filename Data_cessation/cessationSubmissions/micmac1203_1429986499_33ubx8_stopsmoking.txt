Smoked after 4 years smoke free

One is too many and a thousand is never enough. After 4 years of not smoking, I had 'just one' while on vacation in the mountains. I was back to smoking a pack a day within 2 days, and have been trying to quit for two years now. I quit again on 4/16, and have 10 days today. This time I am using Florida Wait line, and the most helpful is having alternative coping strategies when I have strong urges. A quit coach is helping to, as well as patch and gum. I have been in recovery for many years from other addictions and this is the hardest one yet.

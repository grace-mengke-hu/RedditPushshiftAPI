Quitting and Pooping, Pooping and quitting

I have quit a few times. Once for a year and a half, once for eight months and once for three months. Ran into the same problem each time. Pooping! I'm gearing up to quit after vacation again, shooting for good this time. In the past I have tried lots of water, bran, stool softeners. Vitamins, you name it. Each time when I quit pooping becomes a major challenge (read: constipation). Successful quitters of Reddit. How did you get the Porcelain God under control when first quitting?!?

Feeling like an asshole as a nonsmoker

So here's the situation:
I was hanging out with my friend and her friends and I'm the only one who doesn't smoke. My friend knows that I quit and asks me if the smoke bothers me but I'm fine. It smells awful but I can deal with it. One of her friends pipes up about how they would quit but we're all going to die from some sort of cancer anyway so why bother and all of them are in this sort of "yeah, fuck it" agreement. Granted I had been drinking, but this really pissed me off. I started saying how it's fine if they want to smoke but don't give me that bullshit reason of how we're all going to die anyway. ...and I might of went on a little bit about how half-assed it was of them to take the easy way out instead of just acknowledging what they were doing to themselves, etc. etc.... :-/

I should've just let it go but even sober I have no tolerance to listen to this kind of self excusing bullshit from smokers anymore. I feel that I should be more easy going in the future (risk alienating any friends who smoke) about the whole thing but I just feel so strongly about the subject. Can anyone else relate?

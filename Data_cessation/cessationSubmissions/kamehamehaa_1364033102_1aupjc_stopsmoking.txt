I'm attempting again. I need your support. 

I am not completely sure about how successful it will be, I am reminded of all of the times I've failed in the past, and that's a really difficult thing to get over, but if I don't make an effort to consciously take control of my life, I don't think I will be able to achieve my truest potential on any front. Being reminded that you're a slave on a daily basis is the most disempowering feeling you can feel, and I promise to try - actually try - to stop. I'm lighting up now as a ceremonial last cigarette. Tomorrow morning, I hope to be on a different path. Please tell me all you can to help, and give me all the advice that you think would benefit me. Thank you all.

trying to quit, advice please :)

Hey guys/gals! I'm currently trying to quit smoking. I hate smelling like cigarettes, and I HATE needing to smoke a cigarette. This is huge for me because I'm in recovery and have been sober for almost a year. Ive been smoking cigarettes for probably about 5 or 6 years but have been buying packs for 4 years. When I went to rehab a year ago I was smoking a pack a day and after I left rehab I have been smoking between 6-9 cigarettes a day.  What are your guys experiences, is it best for me to just go cold turkey? should I use the nicotine patch? I just really want to be affected by it in the least way possible because I dont want it to effect my mood/thinking which can in turn effect my sobriety. I'd rather die of lung cancer than start shooting dope again.

Is it alright to quit just because I want to get rid of nicotine addiction?

I honestly enjoy smoking, and although I have already put my mind to quit, I really can't imagine a life totally abstaining from cigarettes. Is this the nicotine talking? Did any ex-smoker have the same thoughts as I do now? Because I honestly intend to start smoking again after stopping for a few months.

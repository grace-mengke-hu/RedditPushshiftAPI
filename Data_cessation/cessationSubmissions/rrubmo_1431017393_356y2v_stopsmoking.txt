I smoke 7 cigs max per day and I have a question ...

I don't know if I'm dependent or not but the idea of smoking a "large" number of cigarettes per day disgusts me quite a lot. I'm 19 yo and all teenager from here (France) smoke more than me. I don't really care of them but I'm young and I'm scare that those 7 cigs could affect my future life ... What do you think? Apologise for my grammar and thank you for your attention.

Edit: Thank you for all your answer and your attention, I'm stopping smoking *petit Ã  petit*... But now I'm really decided to quit nicotine from my life. Thanks again.

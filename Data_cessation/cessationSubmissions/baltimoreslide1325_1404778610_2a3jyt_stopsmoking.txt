I relapsed.

I'm bummed out. I really want to be done.  
For anyone else considering relapsing: it wasn't worth it. My brain tricked me into believing it would help with certain specific things I had to get through today but it didn't help with any of them. On the contrary. I knew I was being tricked and I did it anyway. Resetting badge shortly.  
UGH. I just want to be through a month without a cigarette, just want to see the other side! Damn it!  
Advice? :(

EDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for being there. I threw out my $8 pack. I did some journaling about what happened. I'm done, again.  
What I learned: The cigarette DID NOT help me in the way that my addict brain told me it would. I was struggling with a work project and with some sad withdrawal-y feelings but the cigarette didn't take any of it away, just added jitters, shooting pains, and a headache.  
I also learned that it's dumb to delay doing stuff while I'm quitting. Holding out for 72 hours by staying home doesn't really work. As of tomorrow morning (it's late where I am) I'm going to do everything I'd normally do, just without smoking. I even made a list of "triggers" so I can face them and be victorious one at a time. (I kind of get off on to-do lists so this is a motivator for me. If the trigger's already on the list and I experience it, I think it'll help me to think of facing it and then crossing it off later.)  
Also, it makes me feel stronger to believe that relapsing is not the end of my effort, just a part of the learning process.  
Thanks again everyone!! The support here is amazing. Non-smoking internet hugs to all.

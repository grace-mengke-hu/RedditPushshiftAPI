how i quit.

hey guys! I'm new around here. i haven't smoked for 44 days and things are going really well! I thought i'd share the method I used. 

I'd had a friend who had tried to quit but slipped up, and doubted my ability to quit, so right off the bat I was being competitive about it. Trying to prove him and others wrong.

I went onto e-cigs for 3 weeks. It was only really difficult for the first 3 days, but it satisfied both the habit and nicotine addiction so all together wasn't that difficult. The hardest part was drinking with friends who were smokers. one night my e-cig ran out of charge and i had to go home. I figured it was better to leave a party early than to risk doing something stupid.

after 3 weeks i ran out of juice and had to order more. In the mean time i went into nicotine gum instead. although the original plan was to use the gum until i got my next order, I'd gone through so much effort to get out of the habit putting a stick in my mouth and breathing in that i thought i'd just stick to gum and give the order to my smoking girlfriend when it arrived (her mother loves the idea, lol). I've been on the gum ever since and it's going great! The way i see it is, I can try quitting nicotine cold turkey from here and only have to worry about falling back on gum. 

What I've enjoyed most about being smoke free is not having to worry about smelling bad in elevators, being able to hug my mum, having healthier feeling lungs, not having gross nicotine stains on my fingers and of corse, bragging rights. 

Hope you enjoyed reading! And good luck to you all in your quitting endeavours.

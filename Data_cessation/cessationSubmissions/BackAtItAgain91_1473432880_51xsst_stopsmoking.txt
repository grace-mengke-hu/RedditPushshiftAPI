Ridiculously vivid dreams anyone?

I'm 2 and a half weeks off of nicotine (quit my vape, haven't had a cig in years but was still using very heavy nicotine) and from the day I quit till now I've had the most insane dreams of my life. 

Every night I wake up somewhere between 5:30-6:30am (normal sleep schedule is ideally 12:30-8:30) jolted by a dream. Sometimes I can calm myself down to get back to sleep, but even then, I often slip right into another insane dream and wake up again. Other times I won't get back to sleep at all. It's really exhausting because I feel wide awake after these dreams and it's frustrating when I can't calm myself back to sleep. Every night is a gamble.

Just wondering if anyone has some insight as to when these dreams will stop or chill out? They haven't lessened at all in intensity since I quit.

I put my pack under the water fountain.

~~Where do I pick up my badge or whatever those flairs are?~~ Figured that part out. My buddy is quitting dip alongside me as well, this is our day 0. Don't worry, I'll hold him accountable. I had to swing by my ex's place this afternoon to pick up my n64 games, we hadn't seen each other in several months and she seems to be "doing better" than me, which I obviously can't allow. So away with the cigs.

I'm considering going out for some of those over the counter teeth whiteners after I make it a week, as a reward. I want to reward myself periodically with things that deliver the same benefits that smoking takes away. Y'all got any ideas for things like that?

Stay handsome, all.

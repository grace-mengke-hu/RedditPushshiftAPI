Could taste the smoke

Had a smoking dream last night, not a big deal I think everybody has had at least one. Odd thing is I could taste that it was a lucky strike, that brand went off the market probably 15 years ago here. I used to smoke them before they were discontinued but haven't thought of them since. Another interesting thing when I discovered one, I asked for 5 saying " one will never be enough" I think that's a point to remember. Have 1 you need more

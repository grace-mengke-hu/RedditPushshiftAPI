Hi all. What am I doing wrong? I feel so like shit.

Hi all. 

I read this subreddit everyday. 
I always admire all of you who have quit. I have also read allen carr book the easy way. I tried my best to find a way to quit. I am sure I can do better. If everyone can, I surely can.

I am not trying to find excuses. actually my family smoke. There is always ciggerettes at home. I can't ask them to quit... well they get angry which results in "if you want to quit, quit yourself." so yea... it's not helping. 

When I go to school and work. I don't buy ciggerettes nor bring any. I get cravings sometimes but I just try my best to control. There are certain times I fail to resist and bought a pack. After that smoke, I feel so sad. It's like repeating an exam and keep failing. If i manage to not buy any cig for the whole day, I will always try to rush home. Why? Just to smoke. I feel like shit man. I have gone 2 days without cig. The temptation kept coming back. I just cannot take it anymore. I really really want to quit.

I must be doing something wrong. I feel weak man. It is such an easy task yet I fail to achieve this.

What other ways did you all do it? I don't want patches or e-cig. I want complete freedom.

edit: spellings. Sorry if my english is bad.

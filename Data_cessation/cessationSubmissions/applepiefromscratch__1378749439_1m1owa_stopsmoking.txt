My last 20 packs have been "my last pack".

So, like most smokers, I've become an expert at lying to myself. Every time I buy a pack of cigarettes lately, I tell myself "It's ok, this is your last pack.". Then, when I get down to 2 or 3 cigarettes, I start getting really anxious. I tell myself I'm just not ready. That I didn't savor that pack enough, so I should go get a new "last pack" and try again. Every time I do this I feel a little more ashamed of myself. Right now, I have 2 cigarettes left. I want them to be my last. For real this time. So I'm doing something I've never done before - reaching out. You folks have been where I'm at now, and I desperately need help finding the light at the end of the tunnel. Any and all advice/words of encouragement are greatly appreciated. I'm just really scared, and can't really picture my life without a pack of butts in my pocket.

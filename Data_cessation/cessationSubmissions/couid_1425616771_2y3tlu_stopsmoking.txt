What's the story with e-cigs?

I've decided to quit smoking on the ides of March, and was curious whether a vaporizer is a good stepping stone to a completely nicotine free life.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for taking the time to reply! You've been very helpful. I've decided to go down the e-cig route. I'll head over to /r/vaping101 and check out the different flavours. Thanks again and good luck giving up!

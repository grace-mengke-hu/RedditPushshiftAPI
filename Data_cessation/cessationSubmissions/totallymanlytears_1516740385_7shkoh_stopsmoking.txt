Day 1 - Accidently relapsed

Hey guys/gals, just making a post to reflect on the past few days. 

So I was going strong on day 16 and decided to roll a joint like I usually do in the evenings. Little did I know, however, that the table I was rolling on was covered in tobacco (the room was very dark). I smoked the joint and noticed right away that it had some tobacco in it, but kept smoking because I couldn't take the temptation. Ended up smoking 2 more with a little tobacco in them yesterday and today. 

Enough is enough. I will not start smoking again. Just reset my smokefree app. Not looking forward to requitting again but what choice do I have? It was NOT as relaxing or enjoyable as I remember. I could still barely feel a rush at all honestly. Just felt this rush of anxiety again that I know so well; the nicotine is calling me once again. I will say no.

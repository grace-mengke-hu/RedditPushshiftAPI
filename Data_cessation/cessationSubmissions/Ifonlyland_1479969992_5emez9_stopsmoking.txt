For people considering or planning a quit. Watch The Crown :))

You guys I just started watching The Crown. 
Not only is the show 10 out of 10 amazing, it also shows King George suffering from lung cancer and still tragically smoking. 

As an ex-smoker, it really drove home the message for me. It's an addiction that rots our mind and body. 

Edit: I'm on 5th episode and seriously, smoking smoking and some more smoking. Now that I'm a quitter, this grosses me out so much!

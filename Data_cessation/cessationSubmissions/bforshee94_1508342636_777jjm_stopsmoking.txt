Can I Do This?

Tried to quit smoking several times. I'm 26 on Friday and have been smoking for 10 years. Going on day 3 without a cigarette. My husband and I got into a fight because we both needed nicotine last night. He bout cigarettes this morning and said he was going back to smoking. Do I stay strong and fight these urges or do I give in ? I keep getting so angry so easy

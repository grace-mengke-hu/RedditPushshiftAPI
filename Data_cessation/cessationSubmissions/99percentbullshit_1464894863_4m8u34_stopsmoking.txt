if at first you don't succeed

So I tried quitting before, and failed. After a few months, I'm back at it again. Made a few changes to my lifestyle, this time I'm sure it'll stick. It's been just shy of 48 hours since my last cigarette, the cravings are there, but they aren't hitting me like before, and my job is significantly less stressful than the last time I attempted.

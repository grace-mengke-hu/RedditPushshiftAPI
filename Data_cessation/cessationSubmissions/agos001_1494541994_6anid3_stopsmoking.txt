relapsing

i promised myself that i would stop smoking when i was 25, but yet here i am at 26 smoking periodically again. i don't smoke regularly, but old habbits seem to catch up really fast. a couple of drinking nights and then boom- i'm rushing to find someone who smokes so i can bum a cig. i really don't want to crave cigs anymore, but it's a lot harder then i thought it would be. where do you find the self control to not have a cig? it seems that having one here and there leads to me buying a pack, sneaking them when no one is around or when everyone is drunk and then having a couple of days of self loathing.

Quitting together

Hi Redditers, 
Hubby is on his 15 and I am on my 9th day 
WITHOUT CIGARETTES!
Weâ€™re taking the opportunity that his hospital stay and collapsed lung gave us and running with it. He was injured at work pretty badly, 7 broken ribs, two fractured vertebrae, broken collar bone and a partially collapsed lung.  ICU for two days and critical care for 5.
Weâ€™re using the patch.
I honestly never thought weâ€™d get to this point together, we were hopeless at supporting the other in a single effort to do it and weâ€™re amazing at enabling each other to keep smoking.  
Iâ€™ve been talking about quitting ever since a family member got cancer (not smoking related) and Hubby kept saying he was thinking about it but had that â€˜toneâ€™ that said he wasnâ€™t ready.  
So when the accident happened and the doctors told him he had to really really try to quit he mustâ€™ve felt just bad enough to take them seriously, so they prescribed him the patch in hospital and heâ€™s sticking with it.  I started the patch the day before I got to bring him home.  
So far not too bad, havenâ€™t cheated at all.  
The dreams are pretty crazy.  ðŸ¤£ we arenâ€™t sleeping well because of his injuries but still would like to get a more dreamless sleep.
Wondering if I ought to change to the 16 hr patch vs the 24 hr.  Opinions?

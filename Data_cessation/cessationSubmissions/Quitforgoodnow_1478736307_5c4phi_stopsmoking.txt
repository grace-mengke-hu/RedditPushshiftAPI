Day 5 and struggling!

Stopped smoking 4 days ago because I went interstate for a conference and too embarrassed to be smoking. Struggled with wanting to sneak one smoke in but resisted thinking I hate how I'll smell. Came home tonight and found one cigarette sitting in a drawer and had it. Not sure if I actually enjoyed it or enjoyed the relief from cravings. Got a vape thing as well before I left so trying it out so that I won't go out to buy any more cigarettes! Never joined a forum before but looking for support and hoping to find some here. Been smoking since age 17 now 44. Almost feels impossible but still wanting to hang in there and try. Hate the smell, the expense and I can feel myself out of breath easily when I exercise but oh so hard to resist!! Thanks for reading this long post!

I went back. Now I might have a serious heart issue.

A bit of background. I had quit about a month ago. At the time, I used to have a mild pain in my chest. It was one of the reasons I quit, but not the primary one. 

Cigarettes have this nasty habit of making you forget why you left them in the first place. So after about three weeks of cold turkey, I went back. It was "just a cigarette" on day one, like everyone else who spirals back. By the end of the fourth week I had climbed up to about four smokes a day. And that is when I felt it - a sharp, shooting pain in the left side of my chest. It pained only when I took a breath in. It was a lot stronger than anything I had felt before. I went to sleep thinking it would disappear by morning...

The morning after, the pain was still as worse. And a dull constant ache had spread to my shoulder and left arm. These are the symptoms heart-attack nightmares are made of. I went to the doctor, got an ECG done, and there are high chances that it might be cardiac ischemia (a condition where the tissues of the heart don't receive enough blood). 

I am posting this as a warning message for others, and for me, in case I think of going back again later. I am only 24 - an age you might recognize as being too young for this shit. I hope that this post helps at least one person make their decision to stay quit stronger.

1 week gone. Serious blocking nose, hardly can sleep well. Please help.

Smoke free the 7th day,  i feel so happy to be a non smoker after 20+ years of smoking. Feel and smell good.
Please advise whether blocking nose is a side effect?  I suspect catch cold and fever, but unlikely since blocking nose is the only symptom. It kills me at night as hardly can sleep. I feel so tired and suspect one puff can save me from there. Struggling.

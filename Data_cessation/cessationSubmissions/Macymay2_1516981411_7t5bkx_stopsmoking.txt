3 years today!!!

As of today I have been cig/nicotine free for 3 years &amp; I'm very excited about it!

When I first quit this sub helped me so much. Knowing I wasn't alone and the support received helped me immensely. 

I want everyone on this sub to know that quitting and sticking with your quit is 100% worth it. It does get easier. The withdrawal, quit zits, stomach weirdness, irritability, insomnia, speed freak feeling, and over the top emotions all even out and subside over time. You just have to push through the tough time. I smoked for 20 years and didn't know how I could be a "non-smoker", now I can't imagine going back to being a smoker.

Keep it up! Read posts on here and post as much as you need for support. I highly recommend Allen Carr's Easyway book &amp; free quit apps. The more positive reinforcements you have the better. 

Thank you to this sub for all the support it provides!

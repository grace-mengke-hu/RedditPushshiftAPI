Before the deluge of quits at the stroke of midnight, here's mine !!

At the stroke of midnight, when the world kisses their significant others I will kiss goodbye to the friend, lover, the grim reaper who has always been by my side for these past 13 years. 

In sickness and in health, in happiness and in sorrow, for rich or for poor it has never left me alone. I was always happy to see this friend, always ready to embrace whether in full public view or in the confines of my bedroom or my bathroom. Even while working, I could not stay away from it for more than a few minutes-  I ached for its sizzling kiss.

But the time has come for us to part our ways. All good things must come to an end, and this was a roller coaster ride, had its ups and downs. I will always remember the good parts of our relationship like the time we met early in the morning or after a meal but will try to forget the bad parts like the coughing up of green phlegm or not being able to run or swim for more than 45 seconds at a stretch. 

Jealousy may strike when I see friends and strangers indulge with my ex, but I will be strong , I will not waver and as they say, it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, I will always cherish our association and look back it with fond memories but I will not go back.

Tonight I will celebrate my last day of smoking and a lifetime of smokefree existence !!

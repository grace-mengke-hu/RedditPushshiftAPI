things I do not want to forget

Remember when all you could think about was your next smoke, 
smoking one after another all afternoon as you wrote in your notebook how you were going to quit, 
the stench on your clothes, on your hands, in your hair and 
how you could not catch your breath. 
Remember how your throat would burn and you would get choked on your own spit,
the self loathing when I would give in again and again, and drive to the store to buy another pack, smoke and then throw them away only to get the pack out of the trash, and if I had I wet down and I'd dry in the microwave and scotch tape the seams
or I would pull the filters off but still get them out the trash and smoke them like that, 
knowing I was doing something that was killing me.
I remember how I would practically overdose on nicotine and diet coke,
there was NO pleasure in it, none
it only tore me down over and over, my body, my mind, my spirit. 
Thank God I am free!!!!!!!!!!!

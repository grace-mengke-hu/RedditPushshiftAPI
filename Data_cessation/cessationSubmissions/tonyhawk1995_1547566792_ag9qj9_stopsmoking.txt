First attempt after going through this sub!

Just subscribed this subreddit . Can anyone help me through how to start as I am nervous and failed many times on my own when I tried to stop smoking . Getting anxious but at the same time I really want to do this as I know how it affected members of my family before and even to date. I realised my triggers are mostly my friends almost all of them smoke . Can't ignore them abruptly because I am quitting. Can anyone suggest a way through this?

Cigarettes are my best friends

They are there for me when I need them, they don’t judge me.  Im scared to quit because I don’t know what else I have to satisfy me.  My doctor called me yesterday and said it was only a matter of time before I had a “catastrophic event.”  I had a stroke at age 47 that kept me out of work 7 months.  Just turned 49.  I know I need to quit or I’m going to end up lugging around an oxygen tank, but I honestly am afraid to.  Just wanted to throw this out there.  Maybe if I was happy in life I would be more motivated to quit.  It’s full of stress.  Smoking helps me slow down.  It give me a few minutes of alone time. I hate being so dependent on it.  I’ve been smoking since I was 14.  I tell my kids never to pick up the habit.  I made contracts with the kid if they never touched a cigarette until the age 21 I would give them a thousand dollars.  I had to give my oldest daughter one thousand, but not my son (he started smoking and doing pot.). He doesn’t smoke anymore, but he does pot (for medical reasons - her has terminal brain cancer.). If there is anything I could change in my life it would be to never start smoking.  To think I was so cool.  What a dumb shit I was!

Cigar smoker for two years, quitting cold turkey on Sunday and looking for any advice or tips!

A little background on me, I'm 20 years old and started smoking cheap cigars like Swisher Sweets for two years. I smoke about 4-5 a day and I'm getting sick of it. I used to be in great shape and take care of myself. Then I started working nights and smoking and I've gained 60lbs and feel worse than ever. Someone, please give me some advice. I'm nervous.

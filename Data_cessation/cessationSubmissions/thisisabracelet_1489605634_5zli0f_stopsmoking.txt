Excuses again and again.

I'm new here and I'm sick of myself. I'm 29 and have been smoking on and off (mostly on save for a year or so) for 15 years. Recently I've made a commitment to living healthy and have lost about 60 pounds. I hit the gym like an obsession, eat healthy, say no to sweets, carbs, and the only alcohol is maybe 2-3 glasses of wine a week. But the smokes have stayed. That and cannabis are my only vice (cannabis is legal here and the only way I can sleep, and I made a decision to switch to vaping to cut out traditional smoking). I can't stop coughing, especially after I exercise. What's the point in being healthy if I'm killing myself? Is smoking that important? I'm such a hypocrite! The patches make me a fruitcake, they itch, I get dizzy, and I'm going cold turkey but it's so hard. I live with my boyfriend who kicked it cold turkey and he insists after one week, I'll be fine but even after just one full day I bought a pack of Ultra Lights and sneak one a day. I'm disgusted with myself. I don't even want the whole cigarette, I throw it out after two puffs.

I'm throwing out the pack and going to work soon. I'm worried I'll gain weight or lose self control or a million of those other reasons we all tell ourselves but at the end of the day, I am the only person standing in my way. No one is forcing me to do this. It's my choice. I keep telling myself that the coughing is because I'm smoking less and exercising more, but I want this poison out of my system NOW. Bring on the phlegm.

No more excuses. No more whining. I'm done, you guys. I'm just done. Deep breath.

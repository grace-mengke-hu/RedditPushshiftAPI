5 days smoke free, bad cravings lately(rant)

I ended up getting sick this past week. Really helped not smoking. Im starting to feel a  little better after starting antibiotics (z-pack), but my major vice is I love to smoke and drive. Just thinking of smoking gives me anxiety that I feel only smoking can cure. I could really use some motivation to keep my smoke-free streak going.  Thank you ( rant over)

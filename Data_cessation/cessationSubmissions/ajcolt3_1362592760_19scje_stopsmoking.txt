How has everyone dealt with nausea?

I decided to quit last Wednesday after smoking about a half a pack to a pack a day. I went 4 days without a cigarette and the headaches and nausea was terrible. Saturday I went to a bar and couldn't help myself. I had 4 cigarettes Saturday night, then 3 on Sunday, none on Monday and 1 yesterday and 1 today. I am still constantly nauseous and I know smoking over the weekend probably did not help but I was wondering how anyone else has dealt with it.

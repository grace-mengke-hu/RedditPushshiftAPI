Not even a few cigarettes a day is worth it

I've quit several times in the last 10 years, sometimes for multiple years. Every time I have just one, I'm addicted again. 

I used to smoke two packs a day and be jealous of the people who could limit themselves to 5 or less a day. Well, I'm now able to limit myself to 5 or less a day and it's just as bad. I isolate myself when I'm a smoker, and I'm already too introverted which makes that problem even worse.

Recently I've been dating a girl who is a smoker, which got me back into smoking. No amount of sex is worth being a smoker.

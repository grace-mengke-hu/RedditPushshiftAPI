unintentionally stopped smoking for a couple days, and would like to continue it. advice on anything would be greatly appreciated

I haven't had a cigarette in two days, had half of one on Saturday, and one full one on Friday. I've been horribly sick and just can't stand the thought of smoking right now, but I know when I get better I'll want ALL the smokes. 

I was really never into the whole quitting idea, I loved smoking, I enjoyed my habit, and didn't really care about stopping. But now that I'm sick and have gone the longest in years without them I figured I might as well get my shit together and stop killing myself.

I'd like some advice on how to deal with the cravings and such. I read somewhere that electronic cigarettes are far more helpful that patches or nicotine gum but I've tried it and have no care for it. I think I'd have the most trouble with wanting to smoke whilst driving and when I'm bored at work. 

I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a couple weeks now and have been getting slightly jealous at the many successes I've been reading. I'd like to be a success story too, so if you can help please do. :) thanks redditors

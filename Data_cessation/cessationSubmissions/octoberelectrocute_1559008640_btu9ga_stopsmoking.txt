I get short of breath after having even one cigarette

Family history of lung cancer, emphysema and all manner of shitty lung diseases. My parents are avid non smokers because they saw what it did to their parents. I started smoking at 19 and have quit tons of times between 19 and 35 so i can't truly quantify my number of true years as a smoker. I was and still am, when an active smoker, a light smoker. When I'm a regular smoker, I'll have one in the AM, one in the afternoon and one at night. I recently lost my job and so I've been hanging with my smoker neighbor and sit around smoking with her on her patio. I feel fine when I smoke....until the next day when I feel like garbage. My chest hurts, I start coughing and then the symptoms go away for a few days of NOT smoking. Repeat. I'm moving out of here and taking my old job back in another state. I want to stop! But when I'm bored or I hang out with a friend who smokes, I have zero willpower. I want to stop for the rest of my life. How though?  :(

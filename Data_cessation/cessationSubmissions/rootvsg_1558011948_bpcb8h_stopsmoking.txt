Relapsed

I don't see a lot of posts about relapsing so I thought I'll share my story.
Semester ended and I was traveling. Came home, booze was cheap and drank without missing a day. Had a few fights with people around me and I lit up one and then two and within a span of an hour, finished 6.
Ill start with nic gums and try to stop smoking, although I now don't mind smoking occasionally.
Sad but that's the story.

It has to happen now.

I'm 24, been smoking since I was 18. I hate the way I feel winded walking up the stairs to my condo. I hate that I get chest pains. I hate that every few days I go and spend I-don't-want-to-know how much of the money I don't have on something that's killing me.

Today is day one.

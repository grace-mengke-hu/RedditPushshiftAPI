Still haven't bought a pack, but can't help to give in when friends offer me a smoke.

Whether it be a party, or just hanging out. If a friend has a pack and offers me a smoke I will take it. I have resisted the urge to buy a whole pack however. It just seems like a bad idea. I feel like I have come this far but this is my problem. When my girlfriend comes back in two weeks she will have smokes all the time and I do not want to get sucked into smoking all the time again. The fine line between moderation and addiction is a difficult one to tread. Any one have any techniques?

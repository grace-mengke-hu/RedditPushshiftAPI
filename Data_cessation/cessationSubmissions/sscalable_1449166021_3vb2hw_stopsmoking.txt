I just joined this hot new club called '1 year'!

Hardly any cravings anymore and I dont even think about smoking anymore. This time I finally really quit because I wanted to and my SO wanted me to.  I'll be applying for that 2 year club membership soon enough! Thanks for the support /r/stopsmoking !

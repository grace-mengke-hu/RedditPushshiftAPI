[Day 1] I quit smoking because this is not the way I want to die

Sticking to my commitment. Today is day 1 for the rest of my life as a non-smoker.

I think about how smoking is linked to increase risk of EVERY MODERN LIFESTYLE DISEASE. It's not just cancer to worry about, it's everything.

Smoking is death to my body. It's absurd for me to put death into my own body. I refuse to do it. I won't do it anymore. And that's why I'm a non-smoker.

Good luck to anyone else on their first/nth day.

How long will this last for me?

I picked up smoking quite a while ago, but only just recently began smoking frequently. I smoked cigarettes on occasion but I was a bit more into cigars and Vapes because I wanted maximum nicotine. I felt unruly cravings 3 days ago upon waking up and I haven't smoked since. How long will this withdrawal last? Does it matter how long you've been a smoker?

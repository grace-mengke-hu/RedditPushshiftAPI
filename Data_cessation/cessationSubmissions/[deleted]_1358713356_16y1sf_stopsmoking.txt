Maybe its just me... (day 5)

Just killed my habit of smoking 25 cigarettes a day, usually full flavors (reds).

I can't be the only one who would like to compare the past few days to most likely what a heroin or Meth addiction probably feels like? Maybe it is because I was such a heavy smoker, but holy living hell, these withdrawals were 10-fold compared to what I heard all my friends go through. I was legitimately having panic attacks, rage fits (not simple anger), nausea, throbbing migraines, and the shakes. Maybe I'm just a puss... but I've never felt like this in my life. What extremes have you other heavy ex smokers endured?

Does anyone have any tips for dealing with anxiety/mental health issues while quitting?

It's Day 2 today, and last night I was really, really struggling. I threw out all my smoking stuff \[it's still sitting in the bin outside which is hard to resist sometimes\] and was trying to go to bed, and my friend had basically already conked out into sleep already. I was exhausted but as soon as I got into bed I just... couldn't sleep. I have a history of insomnia type traits and sleep problems anyway, but I just got so frustrated and angry and anxious at myself - and usually I'd have a cigarette to push those thoughts away and calm down.  


Does anyone have any tips for how I can get out of that headspace/use any kind of replacement techniques so I don't go back to smoking to deal with those thoughts? I imagine it will be better tonight just because I can fall asleep whenever I need to but any tips would surely be welcome!

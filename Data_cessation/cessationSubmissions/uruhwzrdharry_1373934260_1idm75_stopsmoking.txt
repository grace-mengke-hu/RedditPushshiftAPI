these view days have been very hard.

i constantly kept going back into routine of smoking and every time I'd light it, I'd put it to my mouth then put it out, i wouldn't even smoke it. I trashed my last pack today. So now I'm wondering will my body still be addicted to the hand to mouth motion now that the smokes are no where in sight? wish me luck guys, I'm doing this for my kids and ofcourse me too :)

EDIT: omg i f'd up the title. i meant "few" D:

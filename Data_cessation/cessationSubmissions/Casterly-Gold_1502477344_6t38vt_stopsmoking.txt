Your experiences with Chantix. Have some questions.

I've recently transitioned from a pack-a-day smoking habit to vaping. I want to consider Chantix but I have some concerns. 

Will Chantix help me stop vaping? 

Should I take Chantix with a history of heavy drug use (although now sober)? 

Should I take it with a history of depression/while using antidepressants? 

The goal is no smoking g/vaping cravings, even in the presence of smokers (smelling cigarette smoke is my largest trigger and I live and work with smokers.)

Your personal experiences will be a huge help in making my decision.

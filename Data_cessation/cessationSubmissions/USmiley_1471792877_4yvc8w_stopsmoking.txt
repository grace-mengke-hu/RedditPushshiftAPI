How can I quit smoking again?

 am 29 yrs old, smoked for about 6-7 years quit for 3 years and started again almost now 1 month ago... I didn't want to start but met someone who I had a smoke with and now I feel guilty for starting. I want to stop again and pretend this last month never happened. Looking for support.

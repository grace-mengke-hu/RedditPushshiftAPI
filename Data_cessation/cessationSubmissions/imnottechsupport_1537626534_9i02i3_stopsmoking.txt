My unconventional method

So the last time I quit, I was on the patch for over a week, but then decided to just go cold turkey from there.  I just didn’t want to drag out NRT, I wanted to be done with nicotine.  And it was miserable. It felt no different than quitting smoking cold turkey from day one. 

This time I took a “controlled dive” approach. Strong patch only for the first day, weak patch plus gum for the second (approved and recommended by the brand, but only one piece all day), only gum and the third (four pieces at most all day), nothing on the fourth, nothing on the fifth...I should be coming up on 48 hours nicotine free on top of being smoke free for longer. 

It seems to have made my crash a bit easier...remember that video of the sky diver who got tangled up and survived because he crashed into a plowed bean field? Yeah like that. Still sucks.

I know I’ve got a few rough weeks ahead of me, but I already feel better. Breathing, sense of smell and taste...and it’s great to go to a gas station and only buy gasoline.

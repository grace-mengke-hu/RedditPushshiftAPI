This is day 1 and I hate every second of it.

It's almost over.

I've never quit smoking (save for when I found out I was pregnant, I quit both times cold turkey).

So here I am, decidedly not pregnant, trying to keep myself from driving down to the store to pick up another pack. 

I'm trying to convince myself that my own health is enough of a good reason. I have OCD for which I'm medicated and I have always used smoking as an acceptable way for me to leave a social situation at regular intervals to regain composure.

Shit is not cool right now. I'm sweating and it's all I can think about.

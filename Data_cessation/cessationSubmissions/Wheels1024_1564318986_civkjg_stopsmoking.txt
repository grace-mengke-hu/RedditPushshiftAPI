Advice needed

I’m sure there are a thousand posts on this, and a thousand answers. 

I want to quit. I’m currently going cold turkey and haven’t smoked in just about three days. I started throwing up this morning, having horrible shakes, and I know it’s worth it. It’s difficult with my life situation right now to just quit like that. I have small children and a hard job. I know that isn’t an excuse. 

Other than vaping, because I don’t want too, what are the best things you have used to quit? Patches? Others? 

I’m really trying right now but I know cold turkey is next to impossible to do. I know there are amazing people in here who have gone all the way with it, so I’m not knocking you. I’m looking for other ways because I have a feeling this “Cold turkey has got me on the run”

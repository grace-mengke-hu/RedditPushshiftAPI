On FOURTH DAY of a Non-Smoking Life!

I recently was diagnosed with pneumonia this past weekend, and of course I had to quit to let my lungs heal, but now since I have already stopped I am taking it by storm and stopping for good. It feels absolutely great. This is the longest I have gone without a cigarette in almost 2 years.  I am only 19 years old and I feel I should quit while I'm young.  I have tried to quit in the past but this is the farthest I have made it.  I'm hoping to get better from pneumonia soon, but also stay cigarette free each and every day! :)

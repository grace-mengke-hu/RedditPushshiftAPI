Is there a vape-to-quit subreddit? If not, should there be?

I don't mean for this post to rehash the well-trodden ground of quitting smoking vs. quitting nicotine, the inadequacies of quitting by vaping, etc. There are plenty of those posts, and you can search them up and find all the opinions you could ever want to read.

However: It seems like a vape-to-quit subreddit could be helpful. Anecdotally, lots of people are quitting by vaping. Further, I think folks have some good advice for getting down to 0mg nicotine. It would be nice if there was a place for people to go where vaping-to-quit wasn't so controversial, so they could get a little less Hateorade with their support. 

I am a n00b. I know nothing about setting up a new subreddit. But I thought I would at least mention it in here. 

There are lots of quitting subs, and lots of ecig / vaping subs. But no vaping-to-quit subs! 

What say you?

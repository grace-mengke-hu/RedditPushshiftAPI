Public perception: Nicotine patches = not 'cheating', Vaping = 'cheating'

I realize this sub isn't big on NRT, but it has been working for me.

I smoked about a pack a day for three years. It has been 43 days since I've had a cigarette, I have been using a vaporizer, and I've stepped the nicotine down to the lowest dose.

One minor annoyance I've run into is that I'll tell someone I've quit smoking, and later they will see me vaping. This almost always leads to them saying something like "you're cheating!"

If I was using a nicotine patch/gum/mint they wouldn't say something like this. Has anyone else had similar experiences?

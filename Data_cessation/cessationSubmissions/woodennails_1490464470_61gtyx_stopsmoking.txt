Stop Smoking app ideas?

Hello all, 

I know there are a few stop smoking apps around which are very good, I am a developer currently learning mobile development and also going through quitting smoking (see badge). I am wanting to focus my time into something more productive i.e. creating a stop smoking app.

Just wondering if there was any features you feel that are missing from the current line up of stop smoking apps or anything at all you wish was better about them?

Thanks

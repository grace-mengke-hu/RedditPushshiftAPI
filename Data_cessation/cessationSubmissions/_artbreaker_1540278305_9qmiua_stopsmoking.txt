Day 10 - been the easiest attempt so far!

So I decided to quit again kinda randomly a couple week ago, on the premise that I was realising and becoming more aware that I wasn't actually enjoying smoking. That and the fact I need to save money for a holiday was good enough reason.

Here's the thing though, I've barely needed any willpower in comparison to recent attempts. Every time I think I need a cig I just remind myself that I'm getting nothing from it, all the things I think I'm missing out on, I'm not. Smoking tricks you to think that you're losing out, when in fact the only thing that you're missing is the physical addiction.

If you're still smoking now, I would say smoke consciously every time you have a cig. Notice how after your first drag you're wondering why you're smoking, in the rain, in the cold, pulling yourself away from dinners with friends etc.

The more you make quitting smoking a big thing to do, the more difficult it will be for you to quit. Don't give it the power ðŸ˜Š

Good luck to everyone else trying to quit!

It's an adventure.

I went just under 40 days without a light. I felt good, could breathe again, took pride in telling people that I quit such an awful habit. My boyfriend, who quit with me, was my rock and is always able to get me to stop thinking about taking a drag off a cigarette. 

However, I failed last night. With it being one of my last few quarters in college, I am under a lot of stress and I am far from home and my support system. I got a call that my boyfriend is in jail, and because I didn't know the reason, and because being cognitive is important (instead of drinking or sleeping or smoking a bowl), I turned to my cancer sticks again. I smoked 4 in the past 12 hours, and couldn't finish the 4th one because I felt awful. 

I know I disappointed a bunch of people I have yet to tell, and I am scared shitless to tell my boyfriend, but I figured this would be a good first step. Those 4 were my downfall, and I don't plan on smoking any more of them, but I was convinced I was never going to smoke again. 

Here's, once again, to a new start. 
At least I remembered why I quit smoking... cigarettes taste awful! 

(He's in jail because he was protecting his mom and hit someone, so honorable? but at the same time, I didn't find out why for a few hours afterwards)

12 hours since my final cig

I've been reading the EASYWAY method and while it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, it instilled within me the proper motivation to finally quit for good.

Is there something I could do to make the pangs go easier?,
I kinda feel empty, like I'm hungry, but for a cig, not food.
I know it's the nic talking, and no way I'm going to smoke, but this feeling sucks.

BTW, first time I'm going cold turkey, stopped once in the past using weed and ecigs, but I just want to be done with nicotine forever, sick of it's control on me.

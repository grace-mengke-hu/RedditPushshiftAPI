Anyone had any similar experience?

Hey guys, just wondering if you have any advice for me. 
I'd been a compulsive nail biter my whole life right up until roughly the same month I realised i was fully addicted to nicotene, but not just that but the habit of having something occuping my hands. Long story short my new years resolution was to quit and in my semi successfull attempt to drop it my nails are basically back to bleeding point

any ideas on what I can perhaps substitute this compulsive need to be doing something with my hands. As a first time poster on this website, anything above the inevitable masturbation jokes will be appreciated, especially since I now find myself smoking more and more every day that passes despite my immense fear and awareness of what its doing to me.

April 14th, Quit Day!

Hi all! Just wanted to pop in as I'm gearing up to quit and have set as Monday, April 14th as my official first day without a cigarette. I've been reading these posts and find everything very motivating and helpful, so thank you for existing! I've read Alan Carr's book 

I've smoked for 11 years but it became much more frequent in the last 5 after a few long-term quits. I know what I'm in for and I'm scared but I'm also ready to give it up. The cons definitely outweigh the pros at this point.

My main concern is weight gain but I'm already very active and run/weight train around 4x a week. In the past, I've found I eat less when I don't smoke so hopefully that stays the same.

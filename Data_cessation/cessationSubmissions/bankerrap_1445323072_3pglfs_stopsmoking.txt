"I bet you really want to smoke now?" "Not really"

Yesterday I got into an argument with my boss. Our relationship hasn't been great recently and some things came to ahead. 

At the end she said: "Do you still smoke?"

To which I said: "No"

"I bet you really want to smoke now?"

"No, not really"

And when I said that, it was true. I didn't want to smoke at all. It didn't even cross my mind. I even left in a strangely good mood. 

What makes this better is she is still highly addicted to vaping, and here I am, much calmer with no nicotine in my system. 

Two weeks and counting...

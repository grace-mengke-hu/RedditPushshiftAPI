Here we go again... Once more unto the breach; cold turkey.

I have five days off. Five days with no commitment. Five days where I can do whatever I want and not have to worry. The perfect opportunity to quit smoking. I find it next to impossible to quit if I have social commitments, if I'm going to be drinking, or if I have work I need to focus on.... So now is my chance. 

My plan? Lie in bed for the next five days, doing nothing, if that's what it takes. Here we go again, this time for real.

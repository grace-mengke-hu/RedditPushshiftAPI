Stopping smoking with patches

Hi all,

Iâ€™m a smoker of 15 years and on day three of not physically smoking, but I am using 21 mg nicotine patches and using nicotine gum when I usually light up. The walk to work, at lunch, on the walk back home etc.

My plan is to use up the 7 day box of the 21mg, then go to a lower strength when they're used up and so on and using the gum until the box is empty and no more.

My concern is that the patches and gum may be just an enabler and/or crutch and may not help in the long run. I would like your opinions on whether these are effective to help stop smoking please.

Also, alcohol is a big enabler to get me smoking again and so I have stopped drinking booze completely and just drinking only plain or sparkling mineral water. There is a party with friends soon that does involve lots of drink which I have always enjoyed as it doesn't happen often, but I think this will make me smoke again. Anyone have any tips to help with this?

Apologies for the long post and thank you for reading!

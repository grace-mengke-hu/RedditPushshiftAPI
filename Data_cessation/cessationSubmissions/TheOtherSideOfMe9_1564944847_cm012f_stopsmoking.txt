Been 20Days Since I quit and it's the single most happiest decision of my life.

Have been smoking 5 sticks regularly since past 10 years, and more than 5 when I used to drink or smokeup and it fucked me up psychologically. The withdrawal is real and a struggle to continuously cough but my lungs can already feel a new day coming and honestly, I've soo much energy and lesser mood swings now and I've started gymming regularly too and doing cardio and I feel lighter and it doesn't feel a load on my chest like it used to before.


Although, I feel like I might smoke in winter but I'd best try not to because I know once I relapse it'd be harder to stop. Idk why I have those thoughts and my willpower is fine and I aim to not smoke till December first week, but somehow my mind convinces me or plays a trick telling me to have a puff or two, but I might refrain and not do it. I'm happy that I'm 20days clean though.

First few days were hell and I was depressed, anxious, delirious, irritated and much more and lord knows how I managed those days but after that it gets easier. And what I found is that Coconut Water is your saviour!!! It helps to flush out nicotine and tar and let's you breathe and eases the load, try that folks! You'll thank me. Anyway, I'm just happy and I had to share my progress and I hope I make 20 years some day continuing this progress.

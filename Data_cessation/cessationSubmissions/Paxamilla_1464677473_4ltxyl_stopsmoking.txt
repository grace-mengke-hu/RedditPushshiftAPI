Quitting and depression

Hi everybody  

I'm currently attempting to quit smoking using the patch. I'm on day 10 of no smoking, the longest streak of all my attempts. Even though I am still receiving nicotine, I am feeling pretty down. Is this normal? My understanding is that depression caused from smoking cessation comes from the lack of nicotine, which I'm still getting. Anyone care to chime in? Thanks ☺️

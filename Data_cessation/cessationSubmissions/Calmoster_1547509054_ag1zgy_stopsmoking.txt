Stop smoking cigarettes, keep smoking weed

Hi everyone,

Is that even possible?

I looked for possible means to do so :

I looked for tobacco's substitutes but they all seem to be worse for lungs than tobacco itself;

Vaping could be a good possibility except that you can't share it;

Pipes is the same as vaping;

Blunts would be very expensive, just as eating it...

Has anyone found a way?

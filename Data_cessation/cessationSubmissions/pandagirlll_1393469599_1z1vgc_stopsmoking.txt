This may seem like a small accomplishment..but it's a lot for me.

I have currently gone two days without smoking!! Yay!!

Honestly it really sucks, but my boyfriend and I are quitting together and I 
don't want him to be disappointed in me. 

My main motivation is that I want to start running again! So I am determined to make it through the next few weeks with no cigarettes!

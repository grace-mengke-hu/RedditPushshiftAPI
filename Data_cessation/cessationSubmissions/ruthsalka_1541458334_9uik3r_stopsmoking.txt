a benefit I haven't seen written or talked about- touch

Background: I'm on my 4th serious attempt in as many years. Of course I have to not think of it as an attempt but as a done deal. If I think of it as an attempt, I'm screwed before I even got out of the gate... or in this case, out of bed.

One thing I've noticed each quit is within 48 hours was that my skin felt different.  Rolling over in bed and feeling my arm against my side was like 'woah! who the hell is in bed with me? That skin feels so nice and soft and smooth, and so does the skin on the arm that's touching it..." Oh, it's just me...hmmm...what's up with that? 

Increased blood flow. In the past I've read conversations about increased blood flow after quitting initated and responded to by male reddittors stunned and delighted by how their quit has led to 'woah! what's up with that?' up moments...

It ain't just the guys who experience increased blood flow.  Just sayin.' ;)

Improved sense of taste and smell are a metric on smoke free and are mentioned as known benefits of quitting on every quit sight I know.   Improved sense of touch? Not mentioned or talked about, not that I've encountered, run into, not even here. Right now I can feel every fibre of every piece of clothing I'm wearing.  And I feel alive.

7 Days and just gotta rant

Proud of my days and feeling like I deserve something special; SO had to work late so I decided to come home and order pizza and relax. On my way out in the front door, my boss calls me with something URGENT and it can't wait. Go to turn my computer on and its slow as molasses before dying. Now faced with the double-shitstorm of not responding to work and the prospect of having to pay for a computer repair (or worse a new one). Frantically pacing and cursing and slamming doors for a full 10 minutes. I remembered that SO left rolling tobacco/papers somewhere in his desk and thought about going to look for them, but stopped myself by saying I can get through just today. Maybe tomorrow I'll smoke but not today. Ordering Pizza now, thank you all for being here and inspiring me.

I made it a week!

I officially have gone 8 days without smoking now!! This is the longest I've been able to not smoke since I started smoking. The first few days were really hard, I'm not going to lie. I still get really strong urges, but they are easier to ignore now and they go away a lot quicker than they used to. I feel great!!

Deploying soon, need some advice.

Long time lurker, on and off smoker. Im in the navy and soon am going on a 7+ month deployment. The culture of the military ( at least enlisted where im at ) is very much centered on smoking/drinking. The last year ive spent more time not smoking than i have smoking. Since january though i gave in to the stress and the fact thats its easier to bond with my detachment over a smoke. At least it seems that way. Literally everyone (22 people ) except one either smokes or chews. Im super afraid of smoking this whole deployment because the volume will only increase with the stress. Ive been listening to the easy way to stop smoking and thats helping. What i guess im asking for, does anyone have experience quiting through a deployment? Or experiences in the military in general with quiting. 

Sorry its long and I appreciate any advice ( military or not )   this is the first time ive asked for help like this. Thank you.

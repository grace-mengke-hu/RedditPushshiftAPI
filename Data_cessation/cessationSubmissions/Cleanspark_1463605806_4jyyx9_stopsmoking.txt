Two weeks smoke free and not a single craving

well, 16 days but i forgot to post!

For anyone reading this who wants to quit but hasn't yet, I cannot recommend 'Allen Carr's Easyway' enough. I truly haven't had a single craving and i've been out drinking a few times since i stopped which i was worried i'd struggle with. The closest thing i've had to a craving is a realisation of "Man, i'd usually be smoking now" at a certain time, occasion. But i didn't crave a smoke at all. 

But yeah, i used to be a super heavy smoker and it was pretty common of me to chain smoke at work with the other chain smokers so(and i know everyone says this but) if I can quit anyone can

Good luck guys, you won't regret it.

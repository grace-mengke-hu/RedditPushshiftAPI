I want to quit smoking today

Hi- new to this sub. I have been a smoker for 40 years. Most of this time has been “social smoking” only a few while having cocktails. Most of the time I can’t stand the smell, thought or anything to do with smoking. I’m also a closet smoker and don’t own up to my nasty habit. I quit drinking about 6 months ago- I only used to smoke when I drank but I kept having a few cigarettes after work each day. My SO still smokes and now &amp; smoke with him from time to time. Well, I’ve had enough. I want to quit. I am trying to make lasting changes in my life and the smoking needs to go. Any suggestions? I have a Allen Carr stop smoking book and intend to begin reading it today. Hoping some of the posts on this sub will get me over the hump. 
Thanks!

Hey ex-smokers! Need help for Great American Smokeout. Quick 15-45 second testimonial

Didn't know this was a subreddit, you could just alter the questions to suit when you did smoke or where you were at your worst. I'm trying to push the "Quit for a day" Campaign and the more testimonials the better!


I just want as many different faces on this video since it will be run at loop at my school function center.

Thank you for your time and spread the word! I made a quick video explaining what I want, still uploading my reddit one but it's the same exact thing except I say reddit instead of facebook.

Also I know, my apartment is lit like a Russian prison because it is a Russian prison

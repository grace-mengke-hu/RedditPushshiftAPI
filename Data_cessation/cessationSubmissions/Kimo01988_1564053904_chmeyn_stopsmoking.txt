diagnosed with copd in early stages

I'm 5 months free , 32 years old...still struggling with shortness of breath..went to doc , made breath test then i got diagnosed with copd in early stages... what do you think guys? Can this copd lead to death? Can this diagnosis be wrong and it's just withdrawal symptoms?...please share with me your ideas and experience

I caved...

On day 3 I caved and I've smoked.
My smoker friend was round and we drank and he smoked, and goddammit I needed a cig, so I did.
But I still really want rid of it, and I was doing so well.

Obviously it was a bad idea to get drunk with a smoker on my third day, but I need to know, am I back at square one now? Is giving up going to be harder because of my mistake?

I need any and all advice right now.

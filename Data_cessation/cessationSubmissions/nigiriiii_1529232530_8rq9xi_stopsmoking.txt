Let’s call it a transition period.

So I bought a vape, in hopes to quit smoking. I know, it’s not the most effective way to quit, but it’s been helping me cut down on sticks. Emphasis on “cut down”. I still smoked sometimes, but not that much since I started to vape.

My parents, and relatives were in town this week though, and even though they know I smoke, they still discourage me (as they should), but they’re fine with me vaping. So I sticked exclusively to vaping. They just left today, and I haven’t smoked for a week, and I had a craving so I had one stick.

I couldn’t finish half of it. I took about 3 inhales and 2 mouth puffs, then I stubbed it out. It wasn’t satisfying anymore. The taste and smell got to me, and I was kinda disgusted by it and what I was doing.

So starting today, I’m gonna be exclusively vaping. Again I know it’s not the best method for quitting, but I feel like it’s helping me more than continuing to puff on cigarettes. I will try to quit nicotine altogether, but baby steps I guess. Call me weak willed or whatever, but whatever helps helps, right?

Cheers to quitting cigs!

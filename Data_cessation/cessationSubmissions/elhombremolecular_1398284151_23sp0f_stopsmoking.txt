Help Conquering the Oral Fixation

According to my badge, I have been smoke free for 23 days. And this is accurate. I have been using an electronic cigarette with the lowest nicotine concentration available (above zero, that is). 

I find that when I don't have my e-cig, I don't have nicotine withdrawals (I was a relatively light smoker), but I suffer from "mouth boredom", or just mini episodes of boredom. You know, we all had our "routines".......drive to school, smoke........eat, smoke......it's been 3 hours, need to smoke. 

But like I said, it isn't about the nicotine/not smoking with me, my problem is I sometimes feel bored when I don't have my e-cig. My goal is to quit my e-cig as well soon. 

Anyone have any advice for curing the oral fixation/quit smoking "boredom"?

I'm afraid the only true answer is to suck it up and deal with it, I just figured I would ask you guys first. Thanks!

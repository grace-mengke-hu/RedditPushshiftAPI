Quit day for a University Stop Smoking Program study

Long time lurker, first time poster! 

I enrolled in a program through a university to stop smoking. We’ve done 5 weeks of counseling to figure out my triggers. Talked about the reasons I smoke and how to handle triggers. 

What are some things you have successfully done to switch up your habits? When you really crave a cig, what do you do instead of smoking? 

I’ve never tried to quit before. I smoke a pack a day and have for 10 years. 

Currently wearing the patch and trying to distract myself.

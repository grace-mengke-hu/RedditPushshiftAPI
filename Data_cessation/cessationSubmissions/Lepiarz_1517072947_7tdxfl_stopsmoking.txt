Day 15! What’s next?

Howdy, folks. 

This is easily the longest I’ve ever made it. I’m feeling pretty good, woke up this morning not craving a cigarette (still haven’t had a craving yet), but I’ve still got a little anxiety and jitteriness. 

I’m wondering if you guys have any advice on what to expect over the next week or two?

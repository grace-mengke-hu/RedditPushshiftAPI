Life happens...

I had been smoke free for a couple of weeks, my wife expecting our first child. We found out today that she had an early miscarriage. I picked up the remnants of a stale pack I had (the symbolic remnants of my “last pack”) after that gut punch, and proceeded to light up...one, and then another...and another.
I want to quit. I know I need to quit. I know I can quit.
My last cigarette was 30 minutes ago. I hope, and plan on that being my last cigarette.
I was at a pack a day at my worst, and went to a pack every two weeks recently.
Here’s to one more time of saying “I quit”, not only for my sake, but for the sake of my wife. 
Cheers to all of those who have been dealt raw hands in life, and carried on remaining smoke free.

10 DAYS!!! That's one small step for me, a giant leap for my wallet.

The first days were hard but after 10 days I really feel the difference now.

Now I feel great:

*- I lift more at the gym, because I can breath better during lifting.

*- My resting heart rate has decreased from ~75 to ~60bpm.

*- My head feels more clearer and less foggy.

*- I saved 60€ so far. I used the money to buy two books about investing.

I suffered for one week and it paid off. I seriously know now that I´m never going to do this shit again. I can sleep normal again and I hope that I don´t get that much pain and funny feelings in my body anymore, like I had last week.


Reading your posts everyday helped really much to keep my head straight. Thanks for that.

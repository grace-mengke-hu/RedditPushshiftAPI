11th day

i've been smoker for past 12 years and last month i got acute sinus infection... after i got some treatment for that my doctor said quit smoking... so i said fuck it and i lit my last cigarette...
11 days have past since then... and im constantly thinking about them :D
does it get any easier? and when? 1 month, 2, 1 year or never?! do you have any tips or something that helped you?

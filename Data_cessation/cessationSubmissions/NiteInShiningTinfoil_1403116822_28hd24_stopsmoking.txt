Going on 15 days without a smoke, need some advice.

This is the second time I have quit smoking, the first time lasted about  a year and a half, and I had gained somewhere between 40-50 pounds. I never did loose all the weight and I don't want to gain any back again. The problem I have is that I want to eat all day, all the time. What should i do to curve my appetite? I have the hardest time when I am at work so I need work friendly suggestions.

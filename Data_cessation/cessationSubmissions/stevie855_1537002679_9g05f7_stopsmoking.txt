I quit smoking more than 3 years ago, but I think I have a Nicorette problem

Hi all, 

I quit smoking more than 3 years ago with the aid of Nicorette high strength gum. But I still use it every single day and would freak out if I run low and it is always with me. 

I use 6 pieces of Nicorette per day and get very agitated and unwell if I donâ€™t, the good news is I never think of smoking during those times, but man do I search frantically for Nicorette!

Do you have any method I can use to mitigate my dependency on Nicorette? 

I tried the 2 mg and it was just useless... 
I chew each two pieces together (morning-after lunch and after dinner)

Any tips?

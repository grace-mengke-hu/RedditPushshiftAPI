Interesting at 11 months in I still have dreams

I had another dream last night where I was smoking. I quit in June of 2017. I was so disappointed in myself and felt awful for a few seconds after I woke up. Then I realized that was only dream me and I'm still smoke free!  It was a rush of relief. 

I don't really ever get cravings but every so often I have dreams where I'm still a smoker. It's really weird to me.

I broke today.

A little bit of background:  I'm a young widower.  Last year, on Valentine's Day, I was too much in shock to feel, because it had been only a few weeks.

This year, I made the mistake of having a few drinks and getting emotional and saying "fuck it."  Bought a pack.  Smoked two.

You all can tell me what to do now and I'll read it in the morning.  For now, it's prayers and sleep.

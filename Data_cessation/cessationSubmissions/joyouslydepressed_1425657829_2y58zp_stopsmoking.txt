Quit 2 days ago

After lurking in this subreddit for a year or so, finally worked up the nerve to stop 2 days ago. I smoked for 35+ years and have not managed to stay quit for more than a month in all that time. I think with the help of the Allen Carr book, the Stop Smoking app and this subreddit, I can do this!

Difficulties breathing after stopping

Hey guys, I've been smoking on and off for the past three years. Recently I probably smoke about 5-7 tailor cigarettes a day. I've tried to stop smoking in the past week. I haven't been getting any cravings, probably because I don't smoke that many cigarettes a day anymore. However one pretty big issue for me right now is that I feel like I can't breathe properly at different parts of the day, sometimes before bed I need to take huge breaths just so I feel like I'm getting enough oxygen. 

This always happen when I stop smoking cigarettes and usually I feel that the only cure is to have a few smokes, any ideas what's going on and how I could combat it with something besides a smoke? Is it all in my head?

Allen Carr book

I read the book start to finish today, while smoking almost an entire pack. When I put out that last cigarette I actually felt relieved! Iâ€™m really excited to be a non-smoker and not have something so poisonous control my life! Cheers to all who have quit, are trying to quit and want to quit! WE CAN DO THIS!!!

Just noticed I've been cigarette-free for 650 days. Wow.

If you had asked me two years ago if I thought I would ever be a non-smoker I probably would have said no. I look and feel so much better than I did as a smoker and a few days ago I ran a 10K with ease, something I never would have been able to do while smoking. Just keep quitting until you quit for good. Keep it up and it will work out for you!

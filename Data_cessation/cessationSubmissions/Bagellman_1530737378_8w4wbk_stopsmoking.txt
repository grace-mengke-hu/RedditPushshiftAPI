Smoking when drinking

I just subscribed to this sub - I've been planning to quit smoking for a long time but haven't been able to give it up completely. I used to smoke daily and ever since New year's last year I made a decision to only smoke when drinking in an effort to "slowly quit", and have been pretty much following this rule ever since. FYI I drink once or twice a week. 

The problem is over the past few months I've been trying to quit for good and just can't seem to not smoke when drinking. I'm sure you guys know cigs go incredibly well with beer or vodka, and you can easily start chain-smoking especially if you've had more than a few drinks. On some outings I can finish a pack or a pack and a half by myself.

I live in Dubai where (idiotically) there is no "no smoking" area in bars and clubs, even indoors - so whenever you go out you'll find crowds of people sitting indoors puffing away, it becomes super difficult to resist. I pretty much wake up every morning after a night out feeling like someone left a lit cigarette in my chest overnight.

I mean I could quit drinking altogether but... Other than that is there any advice or thoughts you guys can give here?

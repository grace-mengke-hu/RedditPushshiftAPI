I'm out of cigarettes, and I won't get cravings again until tonight. What's my strategy to quit?

I always try to quit when I finish a pack on a day boundary. It's tough when I have a few left over for the next day. But I've tried this before, and I always just break down and walk to the store around the corner.

I'm a night smoker, so I won't start to get cravings until 6 or so. That also means it makes it hard for me to work on a hobby instead, because I do most of my smoking right before bedtime.

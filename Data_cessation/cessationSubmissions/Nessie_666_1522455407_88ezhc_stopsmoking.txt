E-cig dosage? Second day with no cigarettes

So I’m on day 2 and bought an e-cig (Blue, 2.4%). Is this technically cheating or does it make me more likely to relapse, in your experience? I also have no idea how much I’m supposed to be smoking it. If I can make it through the weekend it will be the longest I’ve gone without smoking a cigarette in years. Atm all I can seem to think about is smoking ;( the e-cig is helping a bit.

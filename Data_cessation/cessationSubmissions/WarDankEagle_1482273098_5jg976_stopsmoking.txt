I may never quit.

I couldn't stop when my mother died of lung cancer.  Couldn't stop when ED actually became an issue in my twenties.  I'm sitting outside of work crying again today, it feels like this panic attack will never stop.  If I make it home without stopping for some, my roommates will be on the porch smoking.  If I make it through the week to the holidays, my family will be chain smoking indoors like they always have.

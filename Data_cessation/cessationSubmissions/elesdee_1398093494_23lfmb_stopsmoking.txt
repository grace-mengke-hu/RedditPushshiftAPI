Day 2.

I feel like I have the flu, I cant stop hacking, the cravings haven't been that bad but I have this overwhelming sense of in-completion. Like a part of me died and I wont get it back. I still go outside every hour and just take deep breaths. I want cigarettes to taste and smell horrible, I still have rose colored goggles on when thinking about them. I swear I can hear nicotine whispering in my ear like a devil on my shoulder, my unborn daughter on the other like an angel. This shit is weird.

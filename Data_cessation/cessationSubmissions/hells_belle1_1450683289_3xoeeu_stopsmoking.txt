Day 1

I have spent a grand total of....13 minutes in this sub.  It took me that long to find it.  My journey into smoking began easily enough.  I dated a smoker and adopted the habits.  I smoked the same brand, at the same rate, etc.  

That relationship ended disastrously which, of course, WAS HELPED BY SMOKING.  

I'm in a brand new relationship now with a lifetime smoker of about 18 years.  I'm on year 4, and while that doesn't seem like a long time, I am a musician and I can't play like I used to.  My great-grandmother smoked about 2 packs of Virginia Slims per day so her house had a certain smell to it and the "smoke level" in the house could be waded through unless you were on your knees next to the floor...much like my Stop, Drop, and Roll education in school.

New boyfriend is on day 5.  I'm on day 1.  I fully expect us to be irritable sometime very soon but hopeful that the healthier future we're facing will be worth it.  Wish us luck, please.

They're going to be so proud of me.

I go back home for Christmas on the 13th (University student) to spend the holidays with my family and I know they will all be so surprised and happy that I managed to quit after 4 years of smoking. Especially my grandparents who are ex-smokers themselves; I can't wait to get back and prove to them all that I can do it, I can do anything I put my mind to. And so can you!

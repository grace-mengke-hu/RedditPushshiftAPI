sore throat and coughing, again, after almost four months, is this normal?

So I'm almost at four months and for the last 4-5 days I've had a super hoarse and sore throat and am coughing up fleghm and stuff. This happened a couple weeks after I quit and as expected from what I've read, after that I've felt completely fine. Is it normal for the sore throat to come back after so long?

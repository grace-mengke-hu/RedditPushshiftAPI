Quitting the day before a long solo trip

So I'm the kind of guy who smokes a lot when lonely. A cigarette feels like an old friend, etc. I smoke anyway, even if I'm at home with my girlfriend, but the point is that if I'm away from home (usually on research trips) then I chain-smoke like a motherfucker.

Tomorrow, I'm heading off on a long trip alone to the desert to carry out some interviews for work. Me, alone, in the desert. Prime chain-smoking territory. The trip itself involves over 20 hours on a bus, so I really cherish a cigarette during pit stops. It just helps to break up the trip. 

However, I'm extremely fed up with being a smoker. I had quit for over 5 months and relapsed recently, and that really pisses me off. So while I know that I find smoking really comforting in situations where I am alone in faraway places, I want to quit right now. 

Am I being completely unrealistic here? Should I just enjoy the smokes while I'm away and then turn a new page when I get home? Or should I just bite the bullet and prove to myself that I can do this. Anyone have any tips on how to cope with loneliness without turning to cigarettes? Or just getting through situations which you associate most with smoking?

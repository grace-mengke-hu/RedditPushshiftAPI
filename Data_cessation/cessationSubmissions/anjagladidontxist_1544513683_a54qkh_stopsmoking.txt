Day 1

Posting on here because I need to stop so I’m going to. I kept telling myself that I can stop when I want to. That was three years ago. I found all my old packets, found three squares and two lighters. Tore up the cigarettes so they’re unusable. Smashed the lighters. Tore up the boxes. I’m going clean. 

I wanted to post on here because I want to hold myself accountable. My mental health has been on an incline the past six months and this is the best I’ve felt in fourteen years. I don’t need this voice anymore. I’m whole and I will keep myself whole. 

I’m done hurting myself. I’m done hurting my mother who loves me so much that she’s done everything she can. I’m quitting. I’m quitting. I’m quitting.

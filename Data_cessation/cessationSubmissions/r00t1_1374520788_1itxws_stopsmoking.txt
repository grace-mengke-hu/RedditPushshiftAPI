Max out your retirement fund to motivate you

I smoked for a little over 4 years, and quit 7 years ago when I began maxing out my retirement funds. 

Conceptually it's challenging to tie that kind of money up for possibly 30+ years, and it's damn frightening to think you may not live long enough to use it. 

Note that the 2013 max is $17,500 in 401k and $5,500 in an IRA/Roth IRA. Even if you just contribute enough to where it starts to hurt your take home pay, and you start making sacrifices you should get some motivation. 

And hey, maybe i'll see you in Hawaii in 30 years.

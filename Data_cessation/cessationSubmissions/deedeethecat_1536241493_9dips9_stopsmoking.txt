Quit smoking support group

Last night was my first of 6 quit smoking support group sessions. I signed up at the recommendation of my pharmacist, knowing that I would already know a lot of the stuff because I had one-on-one support in the past, but there's something to be said about being in a group struggling with something I am struggling with. There were people in the group who had not smoked for a few weeks or months, someone who would quit that day, and someone who was exactly my age and didn't want to quit for the same Reasons I'm afraid of quitting, I use cigarettes as my pretty much only coping mechanism, and I like smoking.

They've given us homework to come up with our plan which I'll be doing this week. On week 4 they give us $500 for nrt stuff which is absolutely amazing.

I know the best day to quit is today but I'm looking at week 4, and giving myself a month and these weekly sessions to build momentum. I will likely by nrt patches and a little puffer thing that dispenses nicotine quicker than gum. In the patch I have done patches and gum.

I'm incredibly anxious and excited about this journey

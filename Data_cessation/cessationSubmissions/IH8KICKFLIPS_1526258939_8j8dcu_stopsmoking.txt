Does anyone have a recommendation for a menthol hard candy?

I had a cold and I noticed that the menthol cough drops really helped me lay off the vape. I want to find a menthol hard candy that I can use to help the process of quitting. Something I can eat 20 a day of or so and not worry about it (obviously I canâ€™t eat 20 cough drops a day for the next month).

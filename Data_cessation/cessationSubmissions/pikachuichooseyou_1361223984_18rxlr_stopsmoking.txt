Adderal and Quitting Smoking Tips?

So I have ADD and am prescribed Adderal, and I need it to function at work. However, I desperately want to quit smoking, and my ADD meds make it damn near impossible. 

Any tips for me that have worked for you? I get tiny anxiety attacks and can't stop fidgeting with my hands and can't stop thinking about how much I want one. This fucking blows.

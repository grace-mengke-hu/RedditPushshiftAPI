Help with quitting vaping

Looking for some advice /inspiration here. I smoked for about 10 years and then quit using Alan carrs book. Fast fwd a few years and I started vaping, did this for about 6mths and then quit (was easier than smoking but still hard) Had a few successful months but this week I cracked and bought a new vape. Reason being I got a job that starts next month in Iraq for 6mths. I know I will want to smoke while out there /much more of a smoking culture so thought I might as well start again before I go. But... Now I'm hating feeling enslaved again and regretting it. The big problem with vaping is the bad side effects are so much less noticeable so there is less incentive, if that makes sense. And it being bad for you is still kinda up on the air. Ugh. Can anyone help? I think I gotta do cold turkey... I'm an all or nothing gal. On 3mg now. Sorry for the long story

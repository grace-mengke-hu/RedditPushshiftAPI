The power of breath

For those who don't know - in short and simplifying things - pranayama is a yogic discipline with roots in ancient India and is about breath control. To practice pranayama means to follow a breathing pattern i.e. to breath in a particular way for a particular time. The repetition of the breathing pattern has a calming and relaxing effect and reduces the stress.

I believe the same mechanism kicks in when we smoke and I associate the calming and relaxing effect of smoking with the repetitive inhale and exhale, pramayana-like excercise.

This would mean that pranayama-like breathing should help with the cravings. And this is exactly the case. At least for me breathing is helping big time. Craving? Slow down and breath. 

For anyone who wants to go a step further I highly recommend an app Prana Breath. It has a number of predefined breathing patterns; one of them is called, surprise, "Cigarette replace". These are very simple 7-mins long breathing sessions which guide you thru the breath in/ out/ hold steps. Works very well for me.

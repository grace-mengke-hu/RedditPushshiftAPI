Just completed my fourth week nicotine free..

for the third time in the last 12 months. Both of my other attempts ended with me smoking a cigarette at roughly the 5-6 week mark, because of some persistent craving. I've been smoking about 30 a day for the last 10+ years, and struggling to end this addiction for the last 5. I really want to be a happy non-smoker. Most of the time I'm fine, but I do still get cravings when I feel like I need to relax, and when I socialize, and sometimes at seemingly random times. I really don't want to go back to smoking, I want to be happy without nicotine. I could use some encouragement. Thanks guys!!! Would love to hear from some people who have been where I'm at and got through it. 


PS - Yes I know about Alan Carr. I have read his book several times and I agree with what he says, but I'm just unable to feel totally free and happy about it like he says I should. When I was younger it seemed to work for me, but after relapsing it just sort of lost its magic. My addiction is very strong and has repeatedly conned me into giving up.

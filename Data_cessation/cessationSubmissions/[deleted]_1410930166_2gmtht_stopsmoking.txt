My "Equate" Walmart brand nicotine lozenges review

This is my second time using Equate Lozenges and just wanted to give a quick review and explain why I like lozenges over gum in general. 
First off, it does take some getting used to. Keeping a lozenge in your mouth as it slowly melts over the next 20-30 minutes is weird at first, but after a few days I actually found it enjoyable. The best part over gum is that there's nothing to spit out afterwards. I personally prefer the mint flavor over the cherry, although the cherry tastes better at first it's far too flavorful for something you will use multiple times a day. 

The lozenges really take the "edge" off of cravings. I smoke 1-1.5 packs a day, and it feels fairly effortless to go without smoking, as long as I don't mentally think about smoking. The hardest part is just that with lozenges there's nothing to replace the hand and mouth habit, but I usually go outside once an hour and breathe some fresh air. 

At $30 for 108 count box at wal mart stores, it's cheaper than amazon, it's definitely worth a try, but I highly reccomend their directions to use for up to 12 weeks, I stopped after only two weeks and relapsed a week after, even when you don't feel you need it, keep taking it!

12 days smoke free but still using E-cigg. I feel guilty. Did I really quit??

I'm currently 12 days cigarette free after a pack a day for 20 years, however I feel a twang of guilt every time I use my 12mg E-cigg. I use it as it should be used, only when I would "normally" have a cigarette (after meals, once every couple hours while just relaxing watching television, etc). I feel like I didn't really quit, as if I just replaced one vice with a slightly less damaging one. I intend to continue to titrate down in nicotine as I have from 24mg to the current 12mg in the past 12 days. Am I technically lying when I say "I stopped smoking 12 days ago." ?? I don't want credit for something I didn't actually do.

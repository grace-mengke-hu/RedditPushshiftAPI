Relapsed After 145 Days

I relapsed last week after going strong for 145 days.  I started glorifying cigarettes again -- thinking they looked cool or something stupid like that.  Whenever I got a craving I stopped telling myself "this is the result of the last cigarette I smoked" and started telling myself "I want a cigarette."  Hopefully sharing my thinking pattern at time of relapse can help someone else stay on track.

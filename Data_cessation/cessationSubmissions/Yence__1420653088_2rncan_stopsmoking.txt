I quit for the final time

25 y/o male here. I have been putting off quitting for a few months now with all kinds of stupid excuses, like "I have too much stress to deal with that now too", mainly.

But last night I was at a place with friends all smoking a lot and I realized I REALLY had enough now, whatsoever. I have been reading Allen Carr's method in the past few days (for the 4th time or so) and it helped a bit.

So yeah, I've had it with it and I haven't smoked in about 15 hours now which is not much but counting. Doing okay.

My previous attempts were two years ago and half a year ago. I started again after 5 and 1,5 weeks respectively, and the reason why i smoked again was mostly due to a lack of self-respect. A sense of not caring enough about myself to actually do something good for myself. I have been struggling with depression since puberty, so these kind of thoughts are always a risk. However I feel like these failed attempts made me learn what the risks are and how to deal with them. I'll have a lot more self-confidence if I really stay off the cigarettes!

However this morning an important thought came into my mind: imagine if I would really have quit the last attempt! I would be a complete non-smoker now for more than 6 months, or even years! Well, that's what I want, and even more. Since all my friends smoke, it's not going to be easy. But that doesn't make it impossible!

It's ridiculous and it has to stop.

I love getting my truck cracking the window lighting up and going for a drive, or so I thought.

What I come to realize is that I never liked it:

1.  I could only roll down the windows part way to keep the ash from blowing back in

2. If it rained I got wet

3. Stoped in traffic the smoke just came right back in 

4. All the mishaps, fuck I droppd my cigarette swerving all over the highway with my head down looking for the dam thing just to find in time to burn a hole in the carpet.

5. My truck fricken reaks.

6. When its night time I cant see out the window, get some cleaner wipe the window and look at that tar I was pumping in my lungs.

7. Kinda feel bad when u blow smoke out the window at a stop light just to realize the car next to you has their window down and all your shit went in their car.
  
I only now realize how much I like driving without smoking. I roll the window down not just cracked, I mean all the fucking way down and you know what I dont stop there I roll them all down.  I really get the wind moving.  I turn up the radio and just chill I dont even care if trafic is backed up.  

There is something about a nice sunny day, I get in my truck,  my shades on, windows down, and the radio up.  I think to myself how great this is and how much I hated smoking and driving.   

Just then I get a big wiff of cigarette smoke I look to the left and there is some sorry SOB with his window cracked smoking, chained to the habit that he thinks he loves.

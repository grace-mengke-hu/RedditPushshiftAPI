6 months free + how to get rid of smoker wrinkles

I honestly cannot believe I ever smoked and if I can quit then anyone can. Never give up trying, no matter how many times you have tried in the past. Being a non-smoker is simply awesome. 

Until a few weeks ago I still looked like a smoker. (Which is a bummer but better than being a smoker :)

I did a lot of research and can now highly recommend micro-needling. I have lost years on my face in a month and especially notice a reduction in the around the mouth lines. 

I wish I had known about it sooner so I am passing it on in case anyone else on here is as vain as I am!

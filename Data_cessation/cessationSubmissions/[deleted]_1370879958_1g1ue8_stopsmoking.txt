What do you guys think about e-cigarettes? Also, this is day 1!

Today, as planned, I've stopped smoking. Gotten rid of my ashtray, lighters and given my remaining cigarettes away. I've been a smoker for about 8 or 9 years and was averaging one pack per day.

This won't be the first time I've attempted to quit. Last time I went the cold turkey route - absolutely no nicotine whatsoever. No gum, no patches, nothing. I lasted about three weeks. This time I've decided that I'm going to take all the help I can get. If I get a craving, I've got some nicotine gum on hand and two e-cigarettes to puff on or hold. The way I see it, I'm still spending a lot less money by using these instead of buying actual cigarettes and my health will still be improving. Or will it? I don't know much about e-cigarettes and I'm wondering what you all think of them - are they beneficial or will they keep me attached to the feeling of smoking in a way that may cause me to relapse?

Of course I know that 99% of quitting is about having the correct attitude and motivation. I view it as an exciting opportunity to end my smoking habit, have more money and feel better. I'm looking forward to having extra money to spend on tastier food or treat myself every once in a while! I always knew in the back of my head that I would have to quit one day and by putting it off I'll only reduce my chances of that happening while I'm still young and healthy.

So yes. I dunno how to end this post! But I'm looking forward to this. Is anyone else quitting today? What are your plans for dealing with cravings? Any useful tips? Anything goes I guess! But I would like to hear your thoughts on e-cigs too.

Cheers!

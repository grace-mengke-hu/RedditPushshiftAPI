I think I did it!

Hey guys. I think I have finally noticed something different about this serious attempt at a quit!

A little bit about me: I'm about to turn 23 and I have been smoking daily since I was 14-15ish. I stopped seriously smoking cigarettes 4-5 months ago and stopped vaping for about 2 months. 

I felt particularly stressed as I was driving somewhere and then in my rear view I saw a woman light up a cigarette. It made me realize how I do not associate my stress reaction with smoking in my thoughts anymore. I think the key difference is this time I truly do BELIEVE that smoking offers me no benefits, so why would I do it?

Also to each his own but I feel that my use of a small  $20 vape used that barely used juice did help me to just cut my nicotine intake and "wean me off". Once it broke in 2-3 months I said what am I gonna do but just decided to give my juice to a friend and stop. It's really been smooth sailing since.

Good luck friends. I hope in a few years to truly be able to say 2017 was the year I quit smoking!

Enough is enough.

I'm so glad that I found this sub. I started smoking two years ago, and I've finally had enough. Well, to be honest, I haven't. I would love to keep on smoking, but in the end, I've got to think of the long term. This temporary fix for any reason is not worth it. I'm hoping that by having the support and accountability of you all I'll be able to quit and move on to a healthier life.

So here's my first check in, my packs are throw out, and I'm going at this cold turkey. Any advice on getting over this next week cig free?

Thanks!

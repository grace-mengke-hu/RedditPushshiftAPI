I've almost hit my first 24 hours. Thank you.

I just first want to say thank you everyone in this sub for being wonderful people and helping others. I decided to escape my addiction for multiple reasons and I was just done dealing with cigarettes. Smoked almost 7 years at 15 a day. I've chewed, dipped, used an e-cig, tried nicotine gum and have had failure. This is my second time quitting, my first being when I went through basic training but I was forced to quit and didn't really want to. I think this is it. I'm really tired of working my ass off just to damage my body. I've managed to hurt my own feelings just by thinking about it. I've had a tough day but every time I start to crave, I tell myself no.  
  
Thank y'all for helping me with advice and resources. Day one almost done. Looking forward to get these first three done again!

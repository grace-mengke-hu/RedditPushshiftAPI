I only lasted 21 hours

No reason to post, I guess I just wanted to say it because I'm disappointed. 

I have the next FOUR DAYS off work because I'm part-time, so, nothing to distract myself. I only had a few vape hits or 1 or 2 cigarettes the past few days but today on my intended quit day, I don't know, I failed. Bought another vape juice. I should have spent all my money on weed so it was 100% entirely unavailable and at least I'd quit that way. I'm reducing/quitting weed though and that seems like the greater of the two evils. 

I will try again after this runs out.

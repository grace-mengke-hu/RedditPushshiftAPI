Going Cold Turkey with Emotional Problems, Need Advice

I am 20/m and I have been smoking a pack a day for approximately 2 years now. I have fairly severe OCD, anxiety, and depression and take medications for them. Lately, I've been stressed due to school starting back up and I have a compulsion that I call "monetary bulimia", where I spend a lot of money at one time and then try to sell things to get money back. Well, this time, I'm not going to sell anything - there is nothing that I own that I truly wish to sell, and due to having no money until next pay day (over a week away), it's time to quit smoking cold turkey.

I know that, statistically, quitting cold turkey doesn't work out too well, but honestly I have no choice. I have enough money for one more pack that I will smoke tomorrow, and after that, I'm done for good. 

Any words of advice for someone with mental disorders/emotional problems quitting? What sorts of things should I expect? What sorts of things can I do to keep myself from going off the deep end? Thank you in advance.

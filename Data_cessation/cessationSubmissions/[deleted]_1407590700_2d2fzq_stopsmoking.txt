I realized it isn't just my second hand smoke...

8 months ago I posted about no longer smoking inside the house and how that was helping me cut back.  

Well folks, I am still on the tobacco train.  Since I started smoking outside I have actually cut it back further and been able to get myself down to only smoking a half cigarette at a time.  

Yesterday though I caught the neighbor kid (about 12-13) stealing my half cigarettes out of the ashtray on the porch.  I stopped him and tried to let him know that cigs are something he wants to stay away from.  

I shared the fact that I am 32 and have been smoking 17 years, over half my life, and still can't bring myself to put them down for good.  I'm sure all he heard was the adult's voice from the Charlie Brown cartoons.  

If it wasn't for the butts in my ashtray (I think I am the only one on the street that smokes (outside anyway)) I am sure this kid would have no easy access to tobacco.  I am debating on talking to his parents, but I don't want to be "that" neighbor.  What do you think I should do?  

*The ashtray is locked in the shed now.

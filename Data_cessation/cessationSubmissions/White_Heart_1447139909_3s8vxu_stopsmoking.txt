What helped me thus far

Hello everyone. I've been smoking since I was 18, smoked for about 10 years then quit. So, I'm using this app called Smoke Free for Android, and it really helps. It has this extra option called "Missions" where it tells you to do something daily related to quitting. My mission for today is to write down a list of all the things that helped me stay away from smoking, and share it here, so there you go:

1. Drinking water. 

2. Reading Allen Carr's EasyWay. 

3. Using the *Smoke Free* app with the missions. 

4. Interacting with others on /r/StopSmoking. 

5. Watching anti-smoking ads on YouTube. 

6. Reading a lot on the internet from government sites like CDC etc. about health effects of smoking and benefits of quitting. 

But the most important thing that helped me make it through thus far is:

***All my previous failed attempts.*** Yes, they do seem like success now, or steps to success, rather than failure.

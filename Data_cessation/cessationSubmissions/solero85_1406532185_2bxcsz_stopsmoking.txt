Im in on this (smoked 2/3 of my life - 18 years. 29 now))

Im 29 now and I started smoking when I was 10. I regularly smoked with 11 and sneaked away in the woods. Smoked with friends and then sprayed perfume into my mouth and threw my clothes in the washing machine. My mother was really a good and caring mother - but no way she could have found out. 

Now 18 years later I still have this fking addiction.
I stopped smoking yesterday and Im sticking with it.

Would be happy about some encouraging posts.

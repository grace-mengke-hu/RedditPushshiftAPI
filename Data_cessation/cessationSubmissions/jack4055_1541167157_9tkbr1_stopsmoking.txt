The struggle is real

I’ve been smoke free for 3 days 12 hours. Previously I have had two successful attempts that made it a combined year. I have been smoking two packs a day for over 4 years now and it’s very difficult for me. I’ve spent so much money smoking to cope with things like depression that I have seriously set myself back financially. On Monday I started to take my life back and have already saved 85 bucks which is a phone bill! I need to stay positive and not beat myself up about the past and just work on the present moment, being hopeful about the future. Happy Friday everyone!

Day 7. The hardest day yet.

I haven't been a smoker very long, but I've been a chain smoker for about 5 years solid. It's hard for me because I produce music and every time I get that fuzzy feeling of accomplishment I would reward myself with a cigarette and contemplate my next moves. It was a ritual of sorts.

I am currently on day 7, and while each of the days up until this point were difficult, I am craving nicotine HARD today. 

The brain can be so fucking destructive... I found myself searching google with "will smoking 3 cigarettes a day cause harm?" when I damn well know that 1 cigarette is exponentially worse than 0... I value being a logical, critical-thinker but it is amazing how illogical addiction can be...

To make it worse, I also work as a LPN (nurse) in a Nursing Home and I kid you not, demented patients who haven't smoked in 30+ years will still cry out for a cigarette at times. One time I actually told a patient, "but you haven't smoked in 30 years!" and he responded with "fuck off, I just had one".... That really kills me because a part of me thinks-- holy shit, the cravings NEVER leave. This is proof!

Whether or not they ever go away, I don't want to smoke. It doesn't do anything for me. Please humor me and tell me it gets easier than this!

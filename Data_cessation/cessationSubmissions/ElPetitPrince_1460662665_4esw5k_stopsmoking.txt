Day 12

I just made myself a reddit account after reading this sub. Im currently on day 12 of not smoking. Just stopped cold turkey after I had eye surgery, and thats my excuse to keep stopping smoking. It cant be good for my eyes . But since Im back in my dorm, its harder than ever to keep it up. I miss the social aspect more than anything, and off course the cigarette after dinner. But Im determined to keep it up! 
I just wanted to share my struggles with you. Best of luck for you all!:)

my addiction is having a spirited fight today....

More than 2 months now since I Quit. I am very much motivated to make sure that I don't some again at all for the rest of my life. But still today has been really difficult. When I parked today morning (there is a shop near by where I used to buy cigs) I had a strong urge to smoke. Then after coming out of a meeting, again I had a very strong urge. Not sure what is triggering this as I don't have any stress or anything like that... just a normal day. I am not going to smoke, but i am little worried about these pangs even after 2 months :D

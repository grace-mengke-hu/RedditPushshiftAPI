1 year! It's been one hell of a ride

I just found this /r/, but after reading through all the love and support this community has to offer I know I want to be here for the continued reminder of why I walked away from this addiction and help others on their quest.

I quit this month last year, It was not easy and was full of months of "trying" only to give in every time. I eventually made the switch to an "E-cig" and used the lowest available other than a 0. I started using my E-cig in July and one day In November I noticed I touched it 3 times the entire day, that night I snapped the vial and threw everything away.

I've came close to resetting my clock. A few months ago I had a job that was just throwing stressers at me and every day I would stop at a gas station, sit in my car and hate myself for wanted to go in and ruin everything I've been working for. I've never felt better, not waking up hacking and those deep chest pains that feel like a black hole had opened up in your lung. I can be active with my daughter and be able to breathe afterwards. Most importantly she doesn't have to grow up seeing me do that to my body. 

To all those still trying, It gets better and I will help in any way I can.
To those who have quit, using this tool we can help others.

24 hrs....

28/m smoked for 14 years. 

I've tried a few times since about November (made it 9 days) but had some issues. weened myself down since monday and now 24 hrs without nicotine. Seem to be ok... been tired , HUNGRY and dont seem to have much patience for anything  or anyone. no REAL "cravings" so to speak (maybe from weening?), but thoughts for sure. I smoked a half i found at work last night and it made my head spin around it felt awful :p  I've got Lemon Ginger tea, gum, fried cheerios(i know its weird but with chili powder and creole seasoning=yum!) an orange an apple and a ton of water. I'm gonna do this ! :D 

Edit: I work graveyard thats why my time for badge is weird

six days on the road and i'm fucking losing it

the uncomfortable reality of being me is that i can hardly hold it together. also, there's nothing special about that. it's just fucking hard so let's all sing a stupid fucking sing-songy song. 

anyways - i've had a terrible weekend where self-enforcing no-no-no-mutherfuckin-nicotine means no talking to anyone. i laid in bed for hours fidgeting my feet. personally, i have two feet. i fidget them. 

eventually, i migrated to a room in my place where there is better climate control, tv, internet, definitely a lack of solace. No friends allowed, because it would be ugly.

This is where the brutality sets in: an entire weekend of migrating between the bed and the gaming computer and the tv. mostly spent in the bed debating the merits of various bad decisions that i have made, and what I might actually do. If you've never heard of depression and don't understand, then I cheer for you. Please learn how to shut the fuck up.

As for getting through it when I'm not in bed, I got onto a show called GLOW - Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. It is fucking great. 

also, no smoking permitted round here

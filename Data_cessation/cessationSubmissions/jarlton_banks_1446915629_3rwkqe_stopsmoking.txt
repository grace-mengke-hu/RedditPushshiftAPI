I keep thinking that smoking is just a foregone conclusion

So I have been unsuccessfully trying to quit for what seems like forever. And I keep having this thought, that smoking is just going to happen. It's just part of what I do, and I know this mindset is really not helping because then I feel like I'm missing out on something if I don't smoke. I am just having really strong cravings, its all I can think about.

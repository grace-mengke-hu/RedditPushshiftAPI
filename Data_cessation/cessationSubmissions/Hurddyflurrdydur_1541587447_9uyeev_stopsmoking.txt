3 Days in

Hey, im new to reddit and im new to quitting smoking and was hoping someone who knows more than I do could help me with few questions I have.

I was led to believe that after a couple of days my lungs should start clearing themselves out but as of yet nothing has really changed.

Ive noticed my mood has shifted to irritability, im struggling with my routine and im constantly telling myself to just keep trying, dont worry about believing or rationalising it just keep being smoke free.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I have is that I decided to switch to vaping using a 6mg/ml tobbacco flavoured e-cig juice and im worried if the nicotine I am still inhaling is halting the progress and that all of this effort is for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post and if anyone could impart some advice concerning why my body isnt "healing" and if I should just stop with the nicotine for now would be very helpful.

Thank you

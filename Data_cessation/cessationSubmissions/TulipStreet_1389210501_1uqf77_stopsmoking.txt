Reflections on being a smoker- nausea in the morning

I have been quit for 527 days and I have to say I am VERY proud of myself. I have quit many times before but started again because I always got complacent. This time I decided I wouldn't let that happen. I've been told that the timeline of quitting smoking is similar to grieving the loss of a loved one- it takes two years to get out of the fog. So I decided to stay committed to this group for two years. This summer, I will hit that mark.

I got up this morning feeling tired. Not horrible or sick, but tired. I started thinking about how I used to feel in the morning as a smoker. I felt disgusting. Some days, if I got up too fast and went out for my morning smoke in a rush, I would get dizzy and go pale and dry heave. This would happen often. I used to get awful headaches all the time. I almost never get headaches now. This morning I got up and felt tired, and I can't tell you how good it feels to get to get up and only feel tired. 

Some words of encouragement for those of you starting out- stay focused, stick with it- it sucks, but you will get through. And don't become complacent. You can never "just have one smoke" in a social situation, no matter how long you have been quit for. It will suck you back in. Your body will feel better, you will live longer and your chances of dying a horrible painful death of cancer with decrease significantly. Take it one day at a time.

Does vaping count as quitting?

I haven't smoked a cigarette in about a month now. I see a lot of different methods to quit in this subreddit, but never any mention of vaping/ecigs. I bought a decent setup (~$90) and it took me a day to get used to but I love it. And in a month I've cut back from 10mg nicotine to 5mg. I haven't ended my dependence on nicotine but I'm getting closer and this method is working for me. I'm just interested to hear your thoughts.

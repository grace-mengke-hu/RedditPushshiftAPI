WARNING: Relapse (for any reason) is not worth it.

I started smoking when I was 17. I'm 30 now. I quit once for 9 months. Another time for a year and a half. And another time for 7 months. In this year alone, I quit for 32 days ... relapsed for two weeks ... quit for 10 days ... and relapsed. At 2:10 this afternoon, I'm stopping again. Always cold turkey. Every time I fail myself, it starts with that mythical "just one cigarette". "Just one" is total BS. Don't fall for it. Cravings pass and eventually go away. Why the hell should anyone re-ingite the craving chain ... over and over?

I have every intention of making this the last time I ever have to drop these shitty smokes. I respect myself too much to deal with this anymore.

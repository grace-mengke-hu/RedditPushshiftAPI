Today is my last day. Glad to be done with it.

I was a late bloomer as far as smokers go. I didn't start smoking until I was 19 years old. My 22nd birthday just passed and I have no reason to be held down by this petty addiction anymore. 

I won't bore you all with the details of why I started, but I'll share the how and whys of my quitting. With chronic bronchitis and constantly hacking up my lungs, I've become sick of this. Additionally, I can't afford to smoke as a poor student. 

I've decided that the patch is best for me (it worked in the past for several months). Just wanted to share. Day one begins.

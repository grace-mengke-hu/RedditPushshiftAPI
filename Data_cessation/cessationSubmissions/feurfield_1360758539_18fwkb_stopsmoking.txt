Here I am again

Hey guys!

I quit for 2-3 months this autumn. I got drunk and smoked one. I managed to smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day for 2 months then went on vacation for a few weeks to my dad, who is a smoker. The past few weeks, I smoked a pack a day like I used to. I'm about to go back home and kick the fucking cigarette in the ass. I'm outta here, again.

So wish me luck guys!

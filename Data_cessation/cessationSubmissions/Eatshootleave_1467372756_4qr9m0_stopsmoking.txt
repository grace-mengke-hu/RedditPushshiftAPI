Faltered last night and feel like shit.

I am a musician and I had a gig last night. Hanging out with my friends, after a well received set, with a beer and seeing them all smoke (not to mention the rain - something I used to always romantically associate cigarettes with) made me decide to take a celebratory night off. I ended up smoking 3. 

And now I feel guilty as fuck. I'm on day 34 according to Smoke Free and I really don't know whether I should reset the thing. I feel terrible. I'd worked so hard and was so proud of myself. 

P.S: I kept coughing, while smoking and it tasted godawful and wouldn't go down the throat, and yet I went at it. But at least I realise now how revolting it truly is. Here's hoping I don't fall down again.

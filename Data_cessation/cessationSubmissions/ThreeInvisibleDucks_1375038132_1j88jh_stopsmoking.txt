Second attempt, this time with help of extended release bupropion (~Zyban)

I quit smoking cold turkey last October inspired by the Stoptober campaign. I managed thru the month and for some time after.

Then the usual happened. I got into a stressful situation in my life and relapsed back to smoking. I kept on smoking up to a pack a day until last week, when I got prescribed extended release bupropion (Wellbutrin XL in US, Voxra in my country) for depression.

It is the same stuff as Zyban which is prescribed for stopping smoking. In a study, it has shown to be around twice as effective in quitting than cold turkey or a nicotine patch:

Inspired by this knowledge I smoked my last cigarette a bit over a week ago. After the first week my impression is that bupropion has made quitting easier compared to my last experience last October. The cravings have been noticably milder. My current situation is different, however, as I'm currently unemployed and have very little stress compared to the period of time of my previous attempt.

I'm also jogging daily now which provides a huge boost for my motivation, as breathing ability is a huge plus in that activity.

As I'm on a tighter budget this time around, saving money is my another big motivator. Saving that â‚¬5 a day (~$6.5) is really noticable now.

Fck addiction... 11 days now! :)

I've been a chain smoker for as long as I can remember. Must have been for more than 20 years. I can't even think of any [photo of myself](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aad_b/5102155657/in/set-72157625211716838/lightbox/) that does not hide me behind a cloud of smoke. Smoke has defined who I was for toooo long. And still, you can break with that bad habit. Just tell yourself you no longer smoke. Other people smoke, you just don't. The craving is still there at times, but it's part of the 'old smoking version'. The 'new me' just ignores it as traces of history. It's not even as hard as I thought it'd be once you think of yourself as a non-smoker.

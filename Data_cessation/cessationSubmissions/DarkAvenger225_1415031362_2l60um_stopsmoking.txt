I'm 14. I have a friend who I think might be addicted to smoking. What do I do?

Well, apparently smoking at 14 is considered normal now. 

I've talked to her, and she knows what it can do to her and her body, but she stills keeps on going because she thinks that it's "relaxing," and takes away stress. It probably does, but arguably it creates more stress in the long term. 

She also did weed for a bit, but switched back to smoking (regularly!) instead. Whenever I tell her to stop, she just tells me that she likes it and it's better than weed. 

How do I even respond to this?

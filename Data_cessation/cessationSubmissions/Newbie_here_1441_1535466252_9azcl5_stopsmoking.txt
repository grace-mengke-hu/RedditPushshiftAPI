Week 3 urges and cravings

So I have read about how day 3, week 3, and month 3 are all difficult times... yesterday I had major cravings, but I am accounting that to it being week 3 and it psychological. Any suggestions on dealing with those psychological urges/cravings? I swear it felt like it was an hour long craving yesterday during a meeting for my dissertation.

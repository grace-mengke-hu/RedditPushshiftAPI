Dual Quit

I'm 23 and have been smoking heavily for about 7 years. My room mate and I quit together on new years eve and the bond has been a great deterrent.  It's nice to have someone there to go through it with, and we've both stayed strong. 
A big part of quiting for me is to get into shape. We have been lifting for a few months and eating better (sort of) but cardio is very difficult for me. before smoking i used to skateboard, rock climb, run track, but sixteen year old me decided to fuck that all up.
Though this has been a big step, i'm afraid of falling into old habits. Often on weekends i'll go out to bars and drink and smoke a'lot. Alcohol loosens me up and iv'e woken up with a world of regrets in the past. I know the simple solution is to stay home, but i'm not trying to quit drinking and hanging out, i'm trying to quit smoking.

I'd appreciate any advice or feedback, it's been a weird couple days.

Just came to the realization, I must go to the bar!!?!?!

My BF is in an RC. They have a meeting once a month, in which all the ladies go to our favorite bar and have a few drinks, giggle, and wait for the guys to finish up...
It just hit me - I have NEVER consumed alcohol without a cigarette!!

The good news: The bar we frequent has a porch that we will sit out on. So I don't have to inhale the smoke.
The bad news: Most of the ladies smoke. 

So, I am trying to conquer this part before it happens... How do I go to the bar, drink, and NOT smoke?! I am kinda freaking out about this...

I'm on my second week, and streaming has helped me immensely

Like the title says, I'm two weeks in. I'm 24 now, and I smoked through high school, through my time in the military, and for my first year of college. This past birthday, I decided I'm sick of feeling unhealthy. I decided to stop for good, and I was excited. For the first few days, though, it was always on my mind. Enter the second part of my title. I started streaming video games on twitch to distract myself. Nothing crazy, no huge commitment, just turning on some software before playing the same games I always do with my friends. Well it's worked spectacularly, and although I'm still literally a nobody on twitch, it's given me something to focus on and drive myself toward, as well as an excellent distraction. Before I knew it, I was skipping my usual between-match smoke breaks, and it just got easier.

I'm posting this in part to encourage myself, but also to encourage everybody here. Quitting is an exciting decision I've made for myself, and I want to keep it going. Also, if you ever want to get some games in with me, distract yourself from a craving or just bullshit with someone that knows what its like, send a PM!

Cheers, fellas. Best of luck on our shared endeavor.

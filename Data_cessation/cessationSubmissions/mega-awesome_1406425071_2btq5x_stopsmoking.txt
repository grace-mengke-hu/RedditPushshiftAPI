Survived the visit with the family!

I survived my visit with my family,who was kind enough to take their smoking outdoors while I was there. But now that I'm back home WOW am I craving. Probably the worst its been. 

I keep telling myself it would be OK to have just one,but I realize even one basically erases the last 3 days of hard work and pain.... Uuhhhgg.. Does not want to feel like this anymore!

My sister tried to tell me to use NRT and didn't understand when I told her I need to get off nicotine not just smoking....

How many more days of constant suck???

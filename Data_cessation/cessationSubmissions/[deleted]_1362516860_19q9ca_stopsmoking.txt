Quit yesterday...

Hi everyone, I'm new here and just found this sub because I quit yesterday and have been craving cigarettes like crazy. I've been smoking pretty regularly for about a year now, mostly because I moved to Paris where everyone smokes. I had smoked maybe 1 or two cigarettes a day (much more erratic in all actuality, I would go weeks without smoking at all) for a couple years before that and really got hooked when I  came here. I decided I have to quit because I'm noticing how much it has affected my palate (I'm a cook) and my athleticism. So anyway, I smoked my last cigarette last night, woke up early this morning, went for a 7 mile run and am hoping to beat it cold turkey. Wish me luck!

Check-in: 8 months!

Hey! I've been meaning to check in. April 1st was 8 months both cig and nicotine* free. I noticed that I've crossed the threshold into feeling put off by the smell in some situations, where it used to not bother me.

Cravings are few and far between, but they're not physical and always have a pretty obvious emotional/associative trigger - usually a combination of the two (walking to the subway after a stressful day at work, for example). They pass quickly.

All-in-all, things seem to be going very well, but I think this is the part where it pays to stay accountable. 

Good luck, everyone.

*Not a jab at those using NRT. Quitting is highly personal, IMO.

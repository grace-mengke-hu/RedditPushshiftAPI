I do not know if I can really stop. I need help.

I cannot count how many times I have “stopped”. I quit for over 3 years once, over a month dozens of times, weeks well over 20 times, and days hundreds of times. I know I will die from this addiction but I am afraid I do not have the strength to really stop. I just smoked my last cigarette ‘for the hundredth time’ and hope to hold out for eternity. Wish me luck.
Again.

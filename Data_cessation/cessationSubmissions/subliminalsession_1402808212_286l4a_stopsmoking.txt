day 8

tonight i managed to go out with my friends, all of whom smoke. i got very drunk, and did not have a cigarette! i was fearing i would do this when drunk as i did it the first time i quit three years ago. new record!!

remember every time you want a cigarette, breathe in deeply and appreciate how you couldn't breathe that good when you were a smoker. it seems to be working!!! it just seems to completely deter my cravings, sober OR drunk.

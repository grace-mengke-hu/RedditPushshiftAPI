I think I need support today ...

I'm a longtime smoker (30-ish years) and short-time quitter (2 wks off cigs, 1 wk off patches ... so far). I think I'm still committed to quitting, but today I'm longing hard for a cigarette and, even more so, for my old smoking life. It's as though I'm feeling homesick: I've been in a really unfamiliar place for 2 weeks w/out cigs and now I just want to go "home." I'm afraid of being overwhelmed by this feeling if it continues for too long. Thanks for reading ... it helps to write this down. I hope all of you feel and stay strong today!

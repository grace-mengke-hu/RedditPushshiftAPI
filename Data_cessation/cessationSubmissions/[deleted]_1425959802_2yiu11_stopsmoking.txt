Getting ready to quit.

It's 10:53pm right now. I plan on quitting starting at midnight. I turn 26 on the 17th and I'm tired of smoking a pack and a half a day. My fiancee is recovering from surgery and we need to save money. I'm not going to pretend its going to be easy, but I need to turn my life around healthwise. We are getting married in 2 months and I want to be in good health for the future. Wish me luck!

How I intend to keep my promise.

I intend to keep my promise by being the stubborn dude I've always been. Every time I'm buying a pack of smokes, I'm just giving someone money to kill me, later on. Have an anarchist attitude if you need to. I hate giving away my money to things I don't need to give it to. Help stop the financial progression of big tobacco companies. And end the oppression of those who can't afford to risk their health and money!

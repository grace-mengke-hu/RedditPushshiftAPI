On day 3 - restrained myself last night

I've smoked half a pack a day for 10 years, started the quit cold turkey 3 days ago. Last night I got in a fight with my girlfriend via text, I was so angry/stressed I paced around my room for an hour curating text messages and willing myself not to smoke to cope. I even got a cig out and put it behind my ear, then caught myself and told that little voice in my head to shut the fuck up. That shit won't help me cope, it will only make me rely on it more. threw the cig away and got into bed. I woke up this morning feeling proud of my restraint and had to share with someone!

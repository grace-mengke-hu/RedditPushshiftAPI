Day 3, one more time. 10th serious quit attempt.

I'm 33. I've been a smoker for 20 years. I don't know if I have another quit in me. I've read easyway a couple of times. The first time I quit when I was 19, easy way worked for 6 weeks.  This last time, I didn't make it 2 days after finishing the book.   I quit this time by taking a trip to the beach with family, and the last time I successfully quit, I took a trip to Asia. That quit lasted about 9 months.  Any advice to not fall into the smoking trap when i get home would be appreciated.  I'm usually successful until I get back to my house, and then like clockwork, I light up.  Other problem areas for me are social occasions with smoker friends. I feel good, I just want to get through this. Thanks in advance.

EDIT:
I made it home, got drinks at a bar, went out to eat at a restaurant, and even went to hear Dr. John at Tipitinas, all without smoking.  I'm still going strong, thanks for the support everyone!

5 1/2 days quit & 100 cigarettes NOT smoked! Starting to really think it's going to stick this time.

Everyone hopes that 'this time is the last damn time I quit', and I think I'm really starting to believe this is truly the last time I quit.  There haven't been as many cravings, my girlfriend has been very supportive (even when I get in a bitchy mood while having cravings), the app I use has been a very good constant inspiration for me.. I can watch the minutes roll by since I've said goodbye to cigarettes for good.  Being 5 1/2 days through this battle and 100 cigarettes not smoked, I can see the horizion.. and it looks good.  Anyway, thank you for your support and I hope your journey is going well.

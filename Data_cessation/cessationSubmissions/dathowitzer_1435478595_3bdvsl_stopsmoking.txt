Two days without a puff - nibble recommendations?

I'm two days without a smoke but finding my cravings are being manifested as hungriness. I'm smashing through m&ms, cherry tomatoes, strawberries, etc. Wondering if anyone has some recommendations on things to nibble on that won't wreck my teeth, burn through my wallet, or end up being worse than smoking?

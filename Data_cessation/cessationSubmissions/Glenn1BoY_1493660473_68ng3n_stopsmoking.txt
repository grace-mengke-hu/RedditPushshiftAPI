Feeling like I have a fever

So, I had my last smoke last Friday, which was after a weeks break and I feel like shit.. I got a mad headache and I'm dizzy feeling like I'm going to have a bad fever, but I've read it's quite normal, but would like to hear if any of you guys have experienced the same? And how long it lasted!

Okay. What do I do?

I've tried this a few times, but I really just don't want to be a smoker.  It's not about my health, or about smoking cigarettes, or about self discipline.  It's about my job.  I'm running a business, and I just don't want to be known in my realm as a smoker.

I hate that I smoke.  For just about every reason you can think of.

So, what do I do?  Just try to see how long I can go without smoking a cigarette and buying a pack?

Also, is there a PC app (since I don't have a smartphone) for quitters?

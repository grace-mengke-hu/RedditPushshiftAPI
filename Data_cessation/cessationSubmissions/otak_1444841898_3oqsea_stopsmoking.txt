The Smell

I'm on day 45 and the number one thing Ive noticed since quitting cold turkey has been my sense of smell. Food, flowers, perfume (sigh) and everything else in between is now much more pronounced and invigorating. The smell of great dark chocolate and freshly roasted coffee adds so much more to my day-to-day life than ever before.

However, the smell I have noticed the most has been the smell of cigarettes from other smokers. I never truly understood just how much the smell of cigarettes stayed with me or how pronounced it was. So glad I don't smell like that anymore and I'm so glad I'm a quitter.

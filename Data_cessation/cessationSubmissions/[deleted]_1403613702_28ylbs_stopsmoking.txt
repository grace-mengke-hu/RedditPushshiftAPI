3rd time quitting

I'm quitting again seriously for the 3rd time (can't remember how many times I've "quit" but not really meant it). The last two times I've fallen over after 6 or so months, usually I pick it up after smoking while drinking. I have a few smokes while drinking, wake up the next morning and don't crave anything so I continue smoking while drinking and end up back on the wagon.

So my question is, how do I avoid that dreaded drunk cigarette? When I've been drinking I find it much harder to resist.

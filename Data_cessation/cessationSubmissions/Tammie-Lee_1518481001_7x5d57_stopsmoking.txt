I listened to a hypnosis video last night.

I keep quitting and then sneak one. I listened to this 8 hour quit smoking hypnosis last night. I’m not throwing a glowing review yet but I’ll tell you- I don’t feel like smoking. I don’t even feel like I was a smoker. Even thinking of smoking seems so alien to me. Posting here and hope it can help someone. I’m hoping this non smoking feeling is going to continue. The video is on you tube - search for quit smoking and Thomas  Hall. I also am tracking my success with the Smoke Free app

Is it normal to feel like a smoker at this point?

Today is my forty-first day without smoking. I haven't gotten any cravings in a long time, but I still feel...connected or attached to smoking. I want to quit for good, but my body feels like this is temporary. It's a difficult feeling to explain and I apologize for the meaningless post, but I was wondering if anyone can shed some light on this for me?

Thank you.

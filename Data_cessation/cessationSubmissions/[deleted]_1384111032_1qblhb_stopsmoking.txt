Can e-ciggerate help?

Hi Guys

I've been a smoker for 3 years now. 
I've tried Cold Turkey 2 times. I've made it to 3 weeks at max.

While the temptation to smoke nicotine reduced the temptation to suck up something increased everyday. Anything. I thought of Hookah as an alternative but where I live it is illegal to own one.

And i gave in.

I was wondering if e-cigs (without nicotine) can help
?

Have wanted to quit since I started, but all my friends smoke!!

Sorry if this topic gets posted a lot - I'm currently on NoFap and discovered StopSmoking, and haven't looked through all the topics yet.

I started smoking weed when I was 15 and cigarettes at 16. I've been smoking like twenty rollies a day ever since. Yet I have always wanted to quit! I hate smelling like shit. I hate the fact that I am dependant and paying Â£20p/w on a shitty chemical that will eventually result in killing me early. I hate the fact that despite being a fairly good looking guy, girls often probably do not approach me as I am smoking. 

My problem is that ever since I have started smoking, all of my friends I surround myself with smoke too. I was hoping to get away from this when I left home for university in September, but all it changed is me smoking a HELL of a lot more bud, and probably a few more cigs a day. 
None of these friends seem to have any intention of quitting, and as I have attempted to quit in the past (failed), their reaction to me quitting is usually unsupportive. I know the answer a lot of people will give me is to stop surrounding myself with smokers, but that just isn't an option for me - I love my friends to bits, and I am sharing a house with them all next year. In addition to this, one member of this house does not smoke, yet still manages to hang out with everyone as much as I do. 

Where the fuck do I start guys?? I've quit in the past for like 2 months when my girlfriend of the time was also quitting, but other than that I haven't gone longer than a week. 

Thank you, and I'm looking forward to replies to motivate me to get that badge next to my name :)
